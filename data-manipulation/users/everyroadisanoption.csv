Start with maybe limiting your phone time. iPhones has the time limit feature on apps which has helped me tremendously and also shows screen time. I make it a game to try and get less and less screen time every day (which can be hard since I use it for work a lot) with little rewards like chocolates or the new pen I wanted. I have a social media cap of an hour a day, same with games. I put no caps on things like learning apps (Doulingo, free rice, etc), productivity apps (Werdsmith, google docs, etc), audio apps (Pandora, audible, podcast app, etc), and e-reader apps (local library app, etc). 

I also moved into more podcasts than video streaming, so I could set down my phone and do other things like clean, craft, exercise, etc. 

For the actually reading part, I started reading with the local library app first. It was on my phone and could feel more like reading comments and the like. I started with smaller things (comics and kids books) and no pressure to read if I got winded. I’m still building up, but now I can read for 30 minutes + again on phone or regular book no matter what genre and it’s only been about a month. 

Someone else mentioned that maybe you like commented because they’re social and you can interact. If that’s the case, maybe joining a book club online could help since you’d be talking with people about the book regularly on your phone. It could be a nice middle ground. 

Good luck!"
ZeroWaste,ffnjy6n,t3_eu58es,1580066958.0,"I do the same for my cat, but instead of gluing together, I found a box in recycling about the size I needed and I just use that as a holder. 

It was a game changer when I moved and had so many boxes around. Add to that that my family keeps sending me care packages, I have a never ending supply now."
ZeroWaste,fevpx42,t3_eqhhx9,1579400051.0,"Don’t go hard core into buying things to be zero waste. That’s the biggest trap myself and others I know fell into. 

It’s exciting to buy that bamboo utensils kit, BUT you already have utensils and you probably already have old fabric you can an utensil holder with. Same with cloth napkins, rags, dusters, face wipes, etc. 

Libraries are your friend, especially if you can find one close to home or if your system has an extensive online database. What’s more eco friendly than reading an ebook instead of buying a book or driving to get one? Instead of having a physical magazine subscription, you can check them out on your library’s app! If you only use a sewing machine once or twice a year, why buy one if the library has one (and yes, some libraries really do rent out sewing machines and other home supplies!). They’re good for being low waste and more wallet friendly. 

Shampoo bars are amazing! Just know you’ll have to try out a few to find what works for your hair and what might work for your hair, might not work for other people in your household. 

Look for produce markets that do local and ugly veg sales. Around me we have two separate places that do 70 lbs of produce for $12. It’s all ugly veg that was going to just be tossed and it’s mostly local. Just know that with markets or pop ups like this, it might be a lot of one veg or fruit. I learned a lot of recipes with squash because of this, but also remember, that a fair amount of produce freezes well. I would look up what freezes best and keep it handy. 

I also keep a photo album on my phone that has screen shots of what my local recycling centers take, what local compost places take donations, what shampoo bars I like, where to buy bulk locally, what restaurants source locally and use sustainable doggy bags or will let me bring my own, etc. It’s a nice little cheat sheet for me!


Honestly, sometimes it’s easiest to start small, like packing utensils for work or buying more food in bulk. Don’t be upset or discouraged if you’re not perfect at it, especially in the beginning. You’ll hear versions of this a lot, but it’s much better for everyone to be trying imperfectly, than to have only a handful of people do it perfect.

Edit: fixed word. Also, if you do a lot of crosswords, sudokus, etc, there are a ton of apps that can be used instead of buying the physical ones. Thrift stores or garage sales will also have a lot of old ones. They be half used, but that’s not a horrible thing"

getdisciplined,fetrm9v,t3_eqc3qd,1579379036.0,"One of the smallest things I do is always leave a blank word doc and excel doc open. It seems silly, but I eventually got used to them being there.  When I started doing that, I opened them up and then left the house to do errands. When I got home I did other things on the computer, but left the docs up. After I was used to them being there, I started using them for simple every day things: shopping lists, tracking sleep, planning out peoples Christmas and birthday presents, reminders, etc. I basically worked it into my everyday life. 

Then when I was used to that, I started to have an easier time using them for writing, school, budgets, ya know the harder stuff. I still get anxious about all that, but the anxiety is way less than it was before. 

Someone else mentioned starting small and giving yourself rewards as you finish tasks which I highly recommend too! It’s really like building up muscles in that case: a person can’t run a marathon if they’ve never run before in their life."
dating_advice,feivlyb,t3_ep4cow,1579148423.0,"He got there way early and got very drunk. Then when I just tried to ordered a hard cider, he kept ordering other drinks for me. I kept telling the bartender, who I luckily knew, that really, all I wanted was the one drink and not the multiple shots and super high alcohol content beer my date kept trying to change my order too.

My date decided a half hour in that he had to meet some friends urgently, but remembered I lived in the area and wondered if he could stop by my place for a few minutes first. 

Needless to say, I stayed at the bar and hang out with staff since it was a slow night there. 

Another time, my date didn’t speak at all and just stared at me, even through the film. I tried a 2nd date because we got along so well via text and email, but really, if someone can’t even say hello on a date, it should just end there. 

One last one, because I could sadly go on for ages, when on a date with another woman, she said not to try anything because she wasn’t actually into women, she just wanted to make her ex boyfriend jealous. 

So..... I’m glad I’m not dating anymore. Dating fucking sucks."

This is going to be really hard the first handful of months, but over time you’ll realize how much better off you are and how much better you feel. 

Easiest way to avoid lovebombing is to block him on everything, inform people it’s over between the two of you and you want no connect, and if he’s ever been to your job, let your boss or security know that he is not to be allowed contact with you (this is big, I worked at a museum and found out months later that my ex was showing up on my break and then watching me from hidden spots. Everyone thought I knew and that he was just waiting to drive me home). 

Start small doing the little things that he would never let you do or didn’t like you doing: eat at that restaurant he always complained about, spend too much time chatting with someone (for me that was my mother, because my ex tried to isolate me from her, but it could be a friend, family member, etc), play the video game he always made you stop playing, do your nails in the color he hates, wear the outfit he wouldn’t let you wear out,  etc. 

Savor the little freedoms. 

Try to avoid the harmful impulses. That’s the hardest part. I didn’t and I ended up in a worse abusive relationship because I thought I was the bad person and deserved to get hurt. 

You are not the bad person. You deserve care, respect, and proper love. 


If you can afford it, go to one on one therapy. If you can’t, there are community therapy groups that can help. I go to a depression support group and a queer support group that have resources and it’s only a pass the hat pay. Sometimes I can afford to drop a fiver or a twenty, other times I can’t afford anything and that’s okay. Chances are there’s a local support group that specializes in bad relationships or abusive ones. Even if you don’t talk, you won’t feel so alone. Sometimes that’s all you need. 

Check your local library for books on self love or find a therapy workbook for you. They don’t have to be focused on your relationship, but they should be focused on you. I just got one to help with self harm impulses. I used one before that was basically 52 weeks of self love. 

In the mean time, do things to show your worth: focus extra hard on work, volunteer at your favorite charity, do something extra nice for your family or friends (like visiting grandma more), express your appreciation to those around you, etc. You’ll be using tangible ways to show your worth. You’ll play a vital role. Plus, quite frankly, if you’re already miserable, why not make other people a little less miserable, right?

Lastly, plan for special days out on the anniversaries you had with your ex: first date, Valentine’s Day, and the like. A trip out of town, 5k, big day out with friends, museums, etc. Anything to keep your mind busy.

You’ve got this. I know it’s hard. I know it’s going to be rocky, but you’ve got this. Remember you only feel weak when you’re using your muscles. Think about when you exercise: your body aches and huff and puffs when you’re running, but when you’ve stopped and it’s an hour later, you feel so strong. It’s the same way emotionally. You’re running an emotional marathon right now. You’re going to feel exhausted. You’re going to hit that wall. But you can do this. Keep running. Break through that wall. It will get better, it will get easier, just finish this emotional marathon. Then you can rest. <3"
