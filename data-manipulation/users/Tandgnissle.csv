stockholm,ff6kptd,t1_ff6hsa9,1579629274.0,"Here you have a [map with explanations](https://sl.se/ficktid/karta/vinter/SL_Sp%C3%A5rtrafik.pdf), red green and blue are the metro or underground, the pink ones are high speed commuter trains, grey and orange are trams and the other ones are old small track commuter trains.

As for where you should look to live it depends on budget and all kinds of factors. Look at what is available, check travelling distance and then ask questions about the areas.

edit: Don't feel bound to the rails either. There are really good communications by buss as well so you could for example live near or in Norrt‰lje, Gustavsberg etc. if you can stomach up to an hour by buss away from the city."
stockholm,ff5sllp,t3_ertgb6,1579608671.0,"If you can live with a bit of public commuting you can get away with a fraction of the cost of living closer to the center. What would you think is an acceptable travel time? Which side of Stockholm is she working on? Use [SL homepage](https://www.sl.se/en/) to check travel times. The commuter trains are faster and don't stop as often as the underground for example so you can live further out along those lines for example. Finding something temporary while you are here is something you could do I suppose.

If you have around 200-300k AUD you can buy an apartment closer to the city proper and easily get that money back (or more) when you move."
sharpx68000,ff2jlgd,t3_eqv8ap,1579509082.0,"Only thing missing is that some games used the Roland CM-64 (CM-32L+CM-32P combination) with or without the SN-U110 series expansion cards, the Roland SC-55, Roland SC-88 and the Yamaha SY22 & TG33. There are also games supporting general midi for even more options."
SegaSaturn,fepwzin,t1_fepdc0t,1579333887.0,"Well, Saturn is [Big Endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness). There are options in the burner program to change the byte order usually, you shouldn't need some external program for it. Just load the rom then search around for the option. It should be byte swap and not word swap at least."
SegaSaturn,feo25x8,t3_eq40l1,1579294134.0,"To flash a region free bios you need to buy a compatible bios chip (SOP or DIP depending on saturn version) and program it with a prop burner (or pay someone to do it for you). After that you need to either remove the old bios or disable it and piggyback the new chip on top of it. It's not something a beginner can do and these days there are other options, like a pseudo saturn kai, phoebe/rhea, the upcomming satiator or just use an action replay or st-key."

radiocontrol,feh0nz9,t1_feh06xn,1579106675.0,"yeah, just strip it and solder it back. The yellow goop is just some sort of silicon used for strain relief. You don't really need to remove the broken piece either to be honest but you might as well if you want it looking better.

edit: You might want to contact seller and have it either fixed or replaced though, if something break later on or some other thing doesn't work and they see what they think is shoddy soldering they might not honour warranty."
WorldOfWarships,fef9oa4,t1_feen73t,1579051468.0,Surprised they didn't keep the barrels for replacements for the other Iowas but maybe they had enough spares?

The first death is when you die.

The second death is when the last person who knew you dies.

The third and final death is when the last trace of your existence is gone."
SegaSaturn,fe97pev,t1_fe96z83,1578935086.0,Well there is that one too but I mean the SEGA Virtua Stick (HSS-0136).
SegaSaturn,fe95th7,t3_eo6bit,1578934571.0,Those sticks are pretty bad honestly. You want the Japanese ones with actual switches in them.
technology,fe8v52h,t1_fe8rq8d,1578931298.0,"My favourites are

* Overriding your hosts file.
* Not being able to control some services due to the install superuser.
* Starting your hibernating computer in the middle of the night because of windows update

AskReddit,fds3j9q,t1_fdqft3v,1578693748.0,I used them for rope access work and I could hang for hours in their harnesses. We used the I'D which is nice since it locks up if you put the rope the wrong way around in it. Also it has an annoying panic function if you descend too fast in it.
funny,fcyxcdc,t1_fcxzbhr,1578089146.0,On a more dark note of what could have been. [Anna Lindh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Lindh) would probably have been our Prime minister if she was not assassinated.

Which part is that?

Fuse is easy at least, just match 110v/230v and amperage, you don't need to bother finding one with legs, as you can see those are actually soldered onto the sides of the fuse itself so you can just reuse those or use the legs cut from a resistor or even some wire."
SegaSaturn,fclke7w,t3_ehtp4h,1577749837.0,"The fuse has clearly blown, if you're lucky that might be all that is needed to change."
SegaSaturn,fcljo2t,t3_ehrdhp,1577749352.0,"You might need to add more solder (and flux) actually if you didn't bend the legs of the chip. The flash rom you are using there has a larger footprint than the old mask rom so you might need a bit more to make proper connection.

You could also have pulled or broken a trace when you removed the mask rom."
