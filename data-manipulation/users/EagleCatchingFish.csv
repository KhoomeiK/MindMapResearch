My current cat says ""nuts to that."" As soon as he sees us sitting at the table for any reason, he'll demand pets on the chair and then jump up on the table for investigation. What's funny is that he doesn't even like people food. He just needs to know what's going on. And then when you get up, he steals your chair."

The second highest administrative body in the Mormon church is ""The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles"", so 12 is a significant number in Mormonism. Also the 12 tribes of Israel, which is a big deal in Mormonism

The number 3 also has significance in Mormonism in two ways: 1. the highest administrative body in Mormonism has three members (The First Presidency), 2. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 

Potentially, you could also have 15, because the first presidency and the quorum of the 12 apostles are 15 members in total. 

So, there are a few different options for number-based symbolism.
