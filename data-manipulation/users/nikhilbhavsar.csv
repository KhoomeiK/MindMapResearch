Of the Tamaskans that were DNA sampled, several tested positive for wolf content (the results thus determined that those Tamaskans are 'wolf hybrids') while others tested negative (thus, those Tamaskans are simply regular dogs without any wolf genes).

If it's your first site, you might want to start with something like Veerotech or knownhost till you have a better idea of how much traffic you can expect and your specific requirements. 

That way you can learn about how hosting (and hosting companies) works, then you can move on to either a vps or managed wp hosting like wpengine or kinsta. I would recommend learning how to manage a vps, it's not that difficult with control panels, and something like digitalocean you can try it out for free for a month before you decide. You can use free panels like plesk or cyberpanel to install upto 3 websites on a droplet, and update them easily. It will save you a lot in the future. Just search for free digitalocean coupons online, or pm me and I'll send you one. (disclaimer: if you use the coupon code I send you, I might receive a small commission. It won't cost you anything, but that is not why I recommend digitalocean, I recommend it because I use it myself).
