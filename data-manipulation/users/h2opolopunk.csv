FloridaGators,feharld,t1_feha524,1579112703.0,">That might be why I give Muschamp some credit as a Gator coach. He obviously was in over his head but man do his players love him. You rarely see players being so outspoken for the love they have for their coach. He had tons of passion.

That's exactly how one would describe Ron Zook as well, and we know how that worked out. I don't think success or failure at Florida is an overall indictment on that coach's abilities, but some personality types just don't seem to work well in Gainesville. However, he does deserve credit for cleaning up Meyer's mess as far as program culture."
