I don't really buy this. As someone with an extremely suicidal history, the difficulty and physical discomfort associated with most of those things stopped me from hurting myself. I can guarantee that if I'd had a gun at the time, I'd be dead right now."

I think it was a mistake to include this bit. People get trashed online for criticizing Trump, but not criticizing him *heavily enough,* so for you to say this probably means people are just going to start insulting you."

No, being obnoxiously insecure does that.

""Are you saying that I wouldn't be worthy of your attention if I *didn't* wear this hat?!""

I find all the *hehehe nice I'm gonna fap to this* comments really annoying as well, but to twist the *general action* of acknowledging someone's attractiveness as inherently dehumanizing is absurd."
