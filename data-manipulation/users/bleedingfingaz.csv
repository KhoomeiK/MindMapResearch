If I didn’t play games, sure, could have bought something in the under $300 price range but if you want something modern with longevity, I don’t really know how else someone my age or younger could do it. Same concept as a fifty dollar pair of work boots vs a two hundred dollar pair."

Tinder,ffln656,t1_fflj48a,1580041706.0,"Hugs back atcha. I’m having trouble focusing right now but I think I understand what you’re saying. Long story short, the more empathetic you are, the more difficult life becomes. At the same time, I choose to believe that the same level of empathy leads to a fuller understanding of “how things are” and makes those who feel it work toward what’s best for everyone. Maybe that’s just some kind of egotistical thing in my subconscious but I’m sticking with it for the time being."

Tinder,ffld70d,t1_fflac6s,1580038043.0,I remember when my college roomy came out to me. 4-5 years after we lived together. I asked why he didn’t tell us then? Nobody would have cared. He said “because I didn’t wanna be.” I will hold that close to my heart as long as I live. It’s a struggle I can’t ever identify with. I can’t imagine what he must have been feeling. I “wish I weren’t bipolar” but it’s not even comparable.

Cheers to all you painters for just sitting down and doing it. Or maybe pacing. I see so much talent in this sub and it is so goddamn inspiring. I’m 30. I should have a better handle on this. But at the very least, I write some damn good riffs. Keep it heavy duders."
MensLib,ffl03um,t1_ffinh90,1580032322.0,"Regardless of sex or gender, if you are vocal about suicidal ideation it is common to be labeled an attention whore. It is the opposite of productive, and further marginalized vulnerable people. Even if it WERE a cry for attention, that could imply all sorts of underlying issues that are better dealt with sooner rather than later. When suicidal ideation festers and goes unaddressed, it can lead to the worst of decisions."
MensLib,ffkzl8y,t1_ffiqxpb,1580032071.0,"I honestly believe this is beyond sex and gender. Anyone who says “I’m going to kill myself” is viewed as an attention whore(or similar phrase). People think if you talk about it openly that it won’t ever come to fruition. This leads to further feelings of isolation and often to short term reckless behaviors. Whether or not a particular person is seeking attention is beside the point. Nobody who brings up the topic of suicide(the act in regard to committing it upon oneself) was taken seriously in any capacity when I was younger. I would argue that discussing this sort of thing is normal, but beyond a conversation here and there if it seems to be becoming a theme in any way, peers tend to write it off. I’m only 30 now but I doubt it’s changed much. The current middle-hs generation do seem to be more kind at face value, but social media is a beast I can’t even touch on. 

—-not a doctor, just bipolar.


Oh and after my attempt, a friend of a friend refers to me as “suicidal _____” every time he sees me. I don’t really appreciate it."
MensLib,ffkz5y0,t3_ettnoc,1580031785.0,"I think a big cultural misconception is that people who talk about suicide openly, regardless of sex or gender, are labeled “unlikely to follow through.” If you talk about these feelings, many people label it an attention grab. Lots of people who speak of the dead say “they seemed so happy.” As in “there were no clues it would lead to this.” 

I’d argue that the majority of people who DON’T discuss these feeling, and subsequently follow through, partially fall into the trap of “well if I talk about it, I will be dismissed as an attention whore.”

Then it sits inside and grows to the point where action feels necessary, rather than discussing where these emotions come from and why they lead to suicidal ideation. 

Also, I have no idea what I’m talking about, I’m just a suicidal jerk, and diagnosed bipolar 1 with one official attempt under my belt. Heavily biased point of view. I’d wager I’m not the only person who feels this way though. This last bit feels weirdly “Braggy” or something, like I’m trying to insinuate I have a clue about how other people function. This is not my attention, and I apologize in advance if anyone feels targeted here."
Tinder,ffktcf5,t3_etz2o5,1580028512.0,"Shit, if I weren’t 30 I would happily volunteer. People are so goddamn shitty toward lesbians. For real tho, most folks are just like “yeah, that dude’s gay” but flip the coin and it’s like “ugh, that fucking lesbo.” It’s super common, even in nyc. 

My cousin is gay and I never would have noticed this line of thought, then after a year or two of her being out I started to notice I do it subconsciously. Idk where it comes from, because in my conscious mind I just don’t care, but then when I’m just going with the flow my gf will say something about her lesbian friend acting psychotic and my first thought is “whelp, that’s why nobody likes lesbians.” Like she’s not an individual with her own issues and dreams and talents but at a base level I just respond with “yup, that’s lesbians for ya.” 

She’s bipolar and schizoaffective. Completely separate from sexuality. I don’t act on it but please tell me I’m not alone with the intrusive anti-gay and anti-minority(black) thoughts due to the environment I grew up in (upstate New York, mountains and cornfields). I moved to nyc to reprogram myself and live anonymously and while I never treat anyone differently on purpose I just feel like I should have made more progress in these 9 crazy years. 

I’m diagnosed bipolar one so I’d like to think I’m very open and accepting of mental illness but that was easy because nobody ever talked about it growing up. I got to form my own opinions because nobody talked about it. I just did research, misdiagnosed myself, and self medicated. I think I stunted my emotional development by not seeking professional help. I’ve been told as much by a psych. 

Why are these things I fundamentally disagree with still popping up in my head? Why, after 8 years of exposure and attempts at real conversation with people so different from my version of normal, do they not stop? Not enough exposure? Doubtful. Maybe it never dies and you just learn to ignore it but it’s a big part in my complex of self loathing. Hell I’m still mildly anti Semitic while dating a Jewish woman, nearly 8 years I might add. Part of her attraction to me is that I look “aryan” even though she would never phrase it that way. Is everyone just a pile of prejudice, kinks, and a desire to be loved? Fuckin A I’m manic right now but I just wanna be better to people. I just wish the nasty shit would go away."
