I'm on protected, intermittent leave at work so that I can work on myself. It's a good week if I go 4 full days, and I've adjusted my schedule 30 minutes forward because of my difficulties getting up when I do go. 

And I'm just so tired. The trauma therapy sessions take so much life out of me, and I don't have much life left to give. I only sleep in bed on the weekends when the husband is home. Tonight will be the first time I've cooked in weeks. He usually isn't hungry before work, and has learned that it's best not to question whether or not I've eaten. He's doing everything right now, from reminding me how long it's been since I've showered to cleaning up behind me when I go on a manic, obsessive baking spree after a session. And yet, he tells me how amazing I am. 

I'm failing. I'm struggling, and I don't want to do the therapy work anymore and I just... want the world to stop spinning for a while so I can catch up. I've prided myself in the past on at least being able to do the household chores when my anxiety is too high to go to work, and now I can't even work up the energy or desire to do that. I'm not amazing. I'm far from it. And sooner or later, he's going to wake up and see what I see."

depression,ff786pg,t3_es1fc5,1579643024.0,"Hey. So I went through something similar a couple of months ago. I was driving to work when ""I bet if I hit that barrier going 65, it would be a painless death"" crossed my mind, and it was all downhill from there. The anxiety took over my life, the ideations got worse. Asking for help was the hardest thing I've ever done, but I did it. I called my primary care office and asked if they had any prescribing mental health doctors in office. They were able to refer me to a local psychiatrist, who got me in the following week. While she manages my medications (which have made a night and day difference,  and I am almost functioning at the same level as I was before), she also recommended that I see a therapist as well. Since I've had bad experiences with licensed therapists or counselors, I opted for an actual psychologist who specializes in trauma work - I was diagnosed with PTSD in addition to my depression when I saw the first doctor. 

It is so comforting to be able to talk to someone about my past and what is causing my present to crumble without them giving bullshit advice or bingoing me or just not having a response. I don't feel like a burden to my psychologist like I do to friends and family when I unload on them, and she is helping me learn better coping behaviors and work through everything I've been through. 

The first step is acknowledging that you need help. The second step, the hardest one, is asking for it. But you can do it."
AskReddit,ff76nk1,t3_es0ze6,1579642167.0,"I lived in a 4-plex with my boyfriend as a late teenager. Loking straight at them, we were in the inside-left one. In the inside-right was a mother, her two adult sons, and one of their girlfriends. The boys were absolute delinquents. She was apologetic, but didn't have much control over their friends showing up at 2am and honking their horns to get them to come out instead of walking to the door like normal people, or the younger one and his girlfriend getting into wall-smashing brawls. 

I tried to be nice. I tried to be the good neighbor and politely ask them to keep it down or tell their friends to be more respectful (confronting the friends was equally ineffective.) At the end I just started calling non-emergency. Girlfriend starts screaming at the younger son? Non emergency. Asshole friend shows up in the middle of the night and honks their horn? Non emergency. 

I learned then that 'Nuisance Tenant' is a thing. After a particularly nasty fight between gf and younger son that ended in him being arrested, I was visited by the mother, begging me to stop calling the cops.

And from what I saw in your last post about her, she flat told you that she didn't feel the same after ""weeks of dating"" when you told her you loved her or something along those lines. That doesn't really sound like she wanted to be really serious with you ""in the dating stage"" and if she said that she wanted to settle down with you (aka be exclusive) AFTER she slept with someone else, there is no issue here.

She had no obligation to be exclusive to you until the two of you made it official. That's how much more official it has to be. Did you request exclusivity while you dated and got to know each other? If you didn't, then she didn't do anything wrong.

I got no support from him whatsoever, and often had issues with him ""forgetting"" about items that he needed final say on, even with multiple reminders throughout the weeks. My last straw was when he impromptu changed my schedule, and then got mad at me for turning in a sick leave request for the next afternoon since now my schedule interfered with a doctors appointment, as well as a request for a vacation day the following week. He told me he wouldn't approve it because there was ""less than a month's notice, which was policy that's in the handbook."" I reminded him that in our state, we have 40 hours of protected sick time and I hadn't hit that yet, and that I intended to ask HR about the vacation request policy. 

HR never responded to my email requesting a copy of the handbook. Instead, I got pulled into his office the next morning and told that I was correct about the sick leave and that no such vacation policy existed so my time got approved. In the same breath, he told me that he was writing me up for lack of productivity. A day never passed that I didn't have all of the items that were supposed to ship that day complete on schedule, save for the ones he pulled back. It was the last in a series of hostility problems that stemmed directly from him.

It was hard to sleep because she needed to be so close that she'd suffocate you. Now, at 11ish years old, she only occasionally comes up for pats and otherwise just minds her own business. She's gotten a bit more friendly with the husband, but still will not get in laps. She's a calico. 

Our youngin at 6, in comparison, is ridiculously needy, and she wasn't as a kitten. Sure, she would come up occasionally and sit beside you for a few moments. But now she seeks me out in the house. If she doesn't notice me leave a room, she will walk through the house screaming for me until she finds me. If I'm not completely vertical, she is in my lap or on my chest and she will try to get there before I've even sat or laid down fully. She's a tuxedo. 

Our favorite cousin has a seal point that, I'm sure, would be happiest if no one was ever in the house besides him. He never comes out from the bedroom unless the humans are outside - you can watch him through the window haul ass around like cats do and play with his toys. But as soon as you open the door to come in, he bolts. You wouldn't know a cat lived there if there weren't toys strewn about. 

Your little one may come around. He may not. They are very independent creatures, which can be incredibly frustrating for dog people. Give him his space. Cats tend to gravitate toward people that ignore them.

Also, kittens frequently do better in pairs. It's not a necessity, but getting him a brother or sister could help him come out of his shell a bit. Just make sure any kitties you get are spayed or neutered. Toms spray when they hit puberty, and queens are ninjas at getting out of the house to go get laid when they're in heat."
