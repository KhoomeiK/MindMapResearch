StardewValley,ff7wl1v,t1_ff7wfux,1579660077.0,Keep going for at least one in game year and make sure to talk to the people in the game. They have really interesting story arcs and character once you get to know them.
StardewValley,ff7wen1,t3_es5ay9,1579659957.0,How many years in game have you played?
feemagers,ff4ij50,t1_ff4iey6,1579564443.0,What works for me with anxiety which is totally different but it’s the best I got is to distract myself I’m with something. Like my cat or an essential oil that smells good or something. It’s not a long term fix but it can be a temporary solution.
feemagers,ff4i9v6,t1_ff4hzsa,1579564268.0,"Without really knowing you, it’s really hard to say. Just from your description, and I’m not a medical professional (I’m a teenager) id say it sounds like adhd or autism. Wild guess though. If it’s a big problem for you, it’s always good to get professional advice even if there is nothing “wrong” with you."
truegaming,ff4i2e6,t3_erlx59,1579564128.0,"I guess I think differently about it, but I’m not a serious gamer. I usually like to look at how many hours I’ve played the game and then see how many cents per hour it’s cost me to play."
feemagers,ff4hu08,t3_erlx92,1579563967.0,"Can you give a more specific example? The best I can say is think before you act, and if you can’t do that maybe see a therapist you might have something undiagnosed."

MakeupAddiction,few1b3x,t1_few0sc3,1579404050.0,"I’m as white as can be. Sometimes I use a brown highlighter as a bronzer because I’m so pale. To make your face look more masculine, I’d go for matte. Remember though that if shiny or colorful or sparkly stuff is what’s calling, who cares? You could also never try any of that and and that’s also ok."
MakeupAddiction,fevzek2,t1_fevy8dw,1579403404.0,"Yes, but only use it on some spots. I like liquid concealer and bb cream, but it might not be a bad idea to try some out at a makeup store. The workers there won’t mind helping you, I’m sure they have seen it all!"
MakeupAddiction,fevy6yh,t3_eqqljd,1579403041.0,"A lot of makeup is geared towards women, so it might be tougher to find things. I would recommend getting some bronzer and placing it down on your cheekbones and jaw line to define it more. I personally prefer powders, I find it easier to apply and not over do it. 

On several side notes, get good quality stuff. I recently changed my bb cream from dollar store brand to bare minerals and it makes a world of difference. My skin not only looks better, it breaks out less too.

When looking for bb cream match the color to the underside of your arm, it’s very close in color to most people’s faces.

Test the stuff on your arm to check for bad react. I have no allergies but I reacted badly to an eyeliner the other day and did not test it out. I should have taken the time to test it. My eyes were burning, but I’m luckily fine.

Buy makeup removing clothes. I think I got five from amazon for like $15. No chemicals, and less waste. Just toss them in the wash and save money in the long run! I wish I had known about these sooner. You will need to get makeup remover for water proof makeup, but I don’t recommend starting with that anyways.

This is probably irrelevant but if you want glittery makeup, use makeup grade glitter. Don’t use craft glitter. It will get in your eye and cut it, and at it’s worse make you blind. Spend the extra money and buy makeup grade glitter from a makeup store."

imveryedgy,fep8dra,t1_fem7knj,1579314436.0,Ok but your friend needs some serious help. Still deeply troubling.
Anxiety,felvedd,t3_epup5y,1579231893.0,"I deal with a lot of the symptoms you described. I haven’t found a perfect “fix” for it yet, but when I can I just try and do something else. Something with no substance, like watch YouTube or play with my cat. Eventually it won’t be in the front of my brain. It’s not perfect and I personally have a lot of work to do on myself, but it’s the best I can give."
