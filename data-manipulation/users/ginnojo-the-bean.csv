Decided to change for the better by actually saying ""no"" when I don't feel comfortable about what is asked of me. Though I got into some bad blood because of it, I don't regret it now and am actually glad I did so."
college,ff35m2e,t3_era5hg,1579534233.0,"In my college, majority would wear simple denim pants and a T-shirt. It's like the school uniform we never had. Then there's the minority who look like they went straight to class from a fashion show or something. But eh, not a lot of people really mind what their peers wear unless it does visually stand out."
college,ff34kct,t3_er72ir,1579533510.0,"YES. I graduated high school excited imagining the many different ways life could be. I was confident I could get through anything because I greatly believed in my ability to learn as well as work hard for the things I want.

Fast forward to two years, I've seriously had breakdowns lasting nearly a week. I can't count the number of times I contemplated about dying. I unintentionally lost 10 kilograms because the stress would take away my appetite. Not to mention, I've encountered evil professors who would take pride in failing AT LEAST 2/3 of the class. I'd study really hard only to end up failing while I see my carefree peers getting better scores than me.

Two years of this and I simply found myself holistically burned out and questioning my life decisions so far."

college,fem0v13,t3_eprgix,1579236147.0,"I agree with you on this one. As an introvert attending a college with a relatively small campus and population, it sucks that wherever you go and whenever, the chance of bumping into someone you know or knows you is pretty high. The college happens also to take in more students than it can accomodate so everywhere is crowded; I'm usually forced to go back to the dorms in the middle of the day (peak hours, a lot of people have no classes and are just hanging around) just because I don't like being surrounded with so many people and there's usually no good place to stay.

Honestly, if I could, I'd moved to a big university. The world here is just too small for my comfort."

college,fegty4j,t1_fegsu8e,1579102464.0,I'm surprised people fall for that stuff way too much for their own good hahaha
INTP,fegrna4,t3_ep2evn,1579100936.0,"This is the time when I will try to subtly end the conversation and bail out. Assuming I succeed with the latter, I'll try to sneak back to my lair and hope no one comes looking for me."
