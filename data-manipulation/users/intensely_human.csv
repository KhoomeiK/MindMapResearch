For the magician it’s that day he did magic for a monkey. 

For the chimp it’s the day of his failed escape attempt, narrowly thwarted by his inability to master the portal’s controls quickly enough to lower the gorilla glass shield and climb through.  

The memory made all the more painful by that smoothskin working then controls like they were easy, grabbing peanuts from the other side.  

Did you see how determined to hold onto it he was after he got the idea of escaping through it? (if matter can be not just received but *sent* through portal - the milk - then it’s a place the chimp can actually *go* and maybe get away from this smoothskin prison). He was suddenly “no fucking way I need to get through this thing now!”"

explainlikeimfive,ffuagan,t3_euvpps,1580237864.0,"The main difference I’ve heard is that CPUs can do logic, ie they can observe memory and based on contents of that memory they can do one operation or the other. IF condition, main operation, ELSE fallback operation.  

GPUs cannot do logic. They can do assignment but not comparison. So their execution path does not branch at all.  

This is really good for handling something like cryptocurrency mining or physics simulation, because there are no IF/ELSE in either of these operations. In physics at least, the equations happen the same way everywhere, so you can take inputs of numbers and give outputs of numbers and at no point is there any condition that would give you different outputs for those inputs."

Just watched Time Cop with Van Damme, there’s a scene where he’s got one hand on a gutter getting stomped and the other’s holding his GF, and she’s hanging onto his hand.  

It goes on for at least a minute or two.  

One handed, I can barely hang my own weight for more than two seconds.  

It must be one of those things that’s just zero until you train it, right? I remember when I first started trying to run distance I couldn’t do 5 minutes continuous, but now after being a runner my whole adult life even if I haven’t ran in months I can just up and jog ten miles.  

Seems like there’s aspects of physical ability that are just completely useless until you push yourself to develop them and then they stick with you. I hope hanging by my hands is one of those things."

science,ffh92n6,t1_fffw9na,1579926638.0,"Compies, the procompsognathids, it would take about a dozen, to fight two little kids.  

And the real velociraptor squeaked like the compies did.  

So they started growing feathers everywhere but their nethers and they came right out of their dino-pores  

Bigger was better till the icy cold weather brought an end to the summer of the dinosaurs.  

Cavemen captured them and made little hats for them and dinosaurs started getting cute. (shoot!)  

How did a tyrannosaurus turn into a bucket for us filled with breaded jaws and claws? Hooves and paws, just following the laws of the cause that draws us out of flaws in the dinosaurs’ denim suit  

(genes, he means, but sewed up without seams)  

Dinosaurs huffin and puffin, runnin from
the stuffing, but we got em on the table and in egg mcmuffins. (brutal, jagged, it’s totally roughneck)  

And now they ain’t nothin! Shrinking through the ages, living in cages, bred to be fed to a lemur in a tie. We don’t even watch em die we just say gimme a large five and it’s down in a plastic seat to eat dinosaur meat, skipping them claws and the feet.  

Now you live on our street, now you’re being our meat, and we don’t even hunt you we just hatch you when we wanna eat. Neat.  

Why don’t you take a seat in the mud here. And we’ll dig up your ass in a hundred million years, no fear, just brushes and chisels and a little other gear, cause you fragile as fuck, ran outta luck, and now you’re all stuck thinking “what the fuckin cluck?”

Fuckin with the clime it’s ... *suicide*, it’s a *suicide*  

Dodos went extinct because they taste good. And they’re lucky that they did cause they never understood what it means to raise a kid in the farm hood.  

Now we eat your meat for the taste, a waste, we chew up Tyrannosaurs Rex to a paste. With molars. The polar bears next, if we can find a way we’ll shrink that bigga too.  

Carnivorous beasts, a three fitty feast, wrapped in paper and wheat, and cheese and yeast. At least.  

What’s our motherfuckin game?  

*Cereal tilla*  

Lightning, Fire. Master of the elements and ... chicken wire. Now picture this: lets follow the talon marks, not velociraptors, veloci*roosters*.  

You got the claws, and we’ve got the saws, and we get ten nuggets and a little cup of sauce, and the most dangerous part of the meal is the straws.  

Fries and shakes, the dinosaur steaks, I never saw a monster ... so brought down, so brought down!  

Tell me, what’s our motherfuckin game?  

*Cereal tilla*  

 You had a good run but the fun’s done hon. You got the short straws and you lost to the paws and the actual cause has to do with under bras, in a way that you just can’t understand. It’s man. Now you’re the supply, and we are the demand.  

Caves, then walls, a chicken wire fence. If you had any smarts we’d just charge you rent. Can’t make amends, can’t make a dent, can’t make sense of the world we invent, because the future is ...
