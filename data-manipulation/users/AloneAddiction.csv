So you're never behind the gear curve when it comes to levelling. Plus RDF, where you're always paired with people in full heirlooms that can solo the place anyway, makes getting Blue gear a doddle.

I do love the quest revamp though. It's just too easy overall is all."
wowservers,fdg928b,t3_ek81v2,1578385248.0,"Unlike Classic with its ad-hoc quest design, Cataclysm went out of its way to breadcrumb everything. Meaning you're *always* sent to the next questhub, and those quests are all centred around that area. No longer are you being told to go everywhere and back for a single quest, wasting a lot of time.

Heirlooms are probably the fastest way to level as you can blast through mobs even faster than normal, and it's already fast as it is. Mobs live for about 3 seconds in Cataclysm as opposed to 20 or so in Vanilla.

If you want to hit endgame fast then join a server with variable Exp rate or buy Exp boosts from the inevitable cash shop."

However, he *did* kill himself. He even tried to the month beforehand. Which is why he was on suicide watch in the first place.

Yes, the internet loves a good conspiracy. But Epstein knew he was out of options this time, and all his celebrity ""friends"" couldn't save him like the last time he got busted for raping children.

It usually takes them a few seconds to realise that I actually *answered* them in English, and by that time I'm long gone."
