Hogfather, Snuff, Wintersmith and Thief of Time are also fun rotations, but Raising Steam was definitely my favourite as I was reading it and for a while after. Shepherd's Crown... Well, you can imagine the marvellous malady of emotions I'm sure."

AskReddit,feaph35,t1_fcg6ujw,1578951067.0,"I can't give you that reason, unfortunately, but I wish you luck in whatever you end up doing. My apologies for the once again late response."
discworld,feaijwv,t3_eo8e9y,1578949215.0,"I took it as more evidence that Vetinari, while extraordinarily careful and competent, is still able to be bested in specific fields that simply are not worth his time to master, given his rather practical set of established skills. Moist is, among other things, *the best at words\**, similar to the way that Rincewind is *the best at running away* and Vimes is *the best at perseverance*, so the fact that ""even Mr. Lipvig"" was more aware of the odd obscure term doesn't particularly surprise me. If you wish to wear any face, you must be a linguist as well as a charlatan. Moist is easily both, to me anyway.

Slightly off-topic but along the same general idea, I've always appreciated that Vetinari makes mistakes. He's not infallible; he merely *projects* infallibility, so much so that it seems to work in our world too. That said, he's supremely good at *learning*, both from his own mistakes and from others' example, so he becomes a lot less prone to meaningful mistakes as the series carries onwards. Bringing it back to the AM-Times crossword, it may well be that an ultimately unimportant interpersonal confrontation that he *can't* win easily is a particularly novel and intriguing proposition for him.

That said, what the -ing heck, dude. :( That's certainly possible and, while I reckon that Vetinari's cross-conundrums make perfect sense in-story already, that's also a plausible explanation. Sir Terry's own embuggerance\*\* wasn't exactly of the more generally-known memory-afflicting sort associated with dementia, but it could well have been an indirect reference. As you say, that would be especially tragic for a man like Vetinari.

\*For the purposes of competition, trickery and the alleviation of boredom, specifically, all of which apply here. Vetinari, of course, exceeds him in the fields of long-term persuasion, subtle intimidation and contextual ju-jitsu, which are slightly less useful when dealing with against-all-odds inanimate paper.\*\*Posterior Cortical Atrophy"

I'm very sorry to hear that you can't enjoy the positive stuff at the moment. I hope that returns as soon as possible, and that it's more consistent.

I know that it can be so difficult to see any change being possible, and I know I can't convince you. All I can offer is understanding and empathy on that front, though I wish I could do more.

I hope you'll not always want that for reasons other than having done it, I should say.

I wish you well for the holidays! Merry Christmas! (if you celebrate it ofc)"
