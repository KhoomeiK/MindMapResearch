So 10x less players, 10x less prem spectators, doesn't really seem much unique about rugby's fan base to claim for the disparity.

Yep, I'm wildly in fear of calling some pasty white reddit user who posts pictures of their cat online a gormless moron, after they call a vast group of people gormless morons based on something as unsubstantiated as the embarrassed millionaire theory.

Edit:

The point was and remains that someone made a statement that you disagreed with, in disagreeing with it you provided no more evidence than the original poster yet believed that despite that, your opinion was so much more valid that you believed it acceptable to throw abuse into your response.

Sure both will get dismissed by some/most, but when you don't even believe in option 1 anyone smearing you for it is literally never going to change your mind or even be worth arguing about, I.e. you'll just outright dismiss it as out of touch patronising elites, cant even argue against it so just make up fake narratives to belittle the working class/make themselves feel superior to the working man.

> Not that anyone ever accepts anything even if provided evidence. There is so much disinformation out there there is ""evidence"" for just about anything.

Seemingly there isn't any evidence for this theory, else instead of castgating about me about not empirically disproving the unsubstantiated claim, someone would've produced evidence for that claim, from which I can either accept I'm wrong, or criticise the validity of that evidence...

> I live in a very conservative area, have literally been told ""f*ck poor people"" by extended (ex-in law) family of the working class only pretending to be rich via debt.

No doubt these people do exist, but I'm questioning about the claim it's a universal/widespread/endemic phenomena, because theres nothing to imply there is.

I also dont get the relevance of your example anyway? They're not ""temporary embarrassed millionaires"" and my example was to highlight the most right wing middle england types JRM ect arent as overtly patronising to the working classes as this sub is, but smearing the working classes as temporarily embarrassed millionaires isn't even subtly calling them thick as shit morons..."

No, because unlike you I don't consider the default position to be poor people are greed driven gormless morons.

You being a racist peadophile, has no evidence, but if I claim you are the burden of proof is on me to provide that evidence, not you to prove you're not, because in reality no evidence exists that you're not a peadophile. Likewise as the claim of the embarrassed millionaire is a tired pseudo-scientific claim no one actually has any evidence it, as a wide spread phenomenon, exists, so asking me to prove it doesn't exist is nonsensical.

You literally are, I started off with asking for evidence of their assertion that the poor tory is a complete, abject, gormless moron and have still received none. You then joined the person I asked for evidence, who then replied to my request for evidence with a request for me to disprove their unsubstantiated claim instead; which is just perverse logic. 

But as Ive already said this sub reddit is for backpatting only, I should've just accepted that they [the poor] are greed driven morons as gospel.

Depressing future for the left, when so many people are happy to denigrate the people who we need to climb abroad, under an air of faux intellectualism. The more time I spend on this sub the more I can understand people voting against their class interests...

Faux reddit intellectuals: Well actually you cannot call this person an abusive moron, because that's hypocritical, unless you're willing to provide evidence that black people are in fact equal don't bother replying.

Coming from a privileged background I always found the phenomenon of poor people voting tory slightly funny in a perverse way, but the more time I spend in this sub the easier it become to understand. While the right rely on disengenious theories like wealth creators ect, those theories are more welcoming/intuitive than ""poor people are thick as shit greedy morons, waiting for their big payday"".

Edit:

> If you really want evidence of how a lot of people have a false view of their economic status, just look at the retaliation against the £80k tax bracket changes proposed by Labour. A lot of people who are nowhere near that tax bracket were sure it would potentially affect them because they thought they were also amongst the ""top earners"".

Again any evidence? No.

Nothing suggests poor people believing that they'd earn those sums, nor was the right campaigning around that. The entire campaign centred around the tories being the only option to not destroy the economy ""socialist dystopias ect"" implying that people voted conservative through fear of losing what they already had, not because they believed they'd come into more."

Genuinely, as no one is willing to provide any evidence of the ""temporary embarrassed millionaire"" why do you think that the GE campaigning focused, extremely successfully, intensely on the risk of losing what people rather than ""vote tory and we'll all be rich""?

But hey this sub reddit was seemingly made for people to pat themselves as they falsely smear people, entrenching their misplaced beliefs. Calling someone, who believes that capitalism is responsible for them having food rather than starving, a ""temporary embarrassed millionaire"" probably pushes them further to the right because they'll happy then listen to the self proclaimed ""men of the people"" who can rightly claim ""look at those patronising elites on the left who belittle and mock you"", which is how we end up with the nonsensical outcome of JRM and Boris Johnson being men of the people."

Your other points, I've said that them voting tory isn't in their interest, but calling someone who votes tory against their interests (because they ignorantly believe in trickle down economics) a thick as shit moron who thinks they'll delusionally become rich, isn't going to stop anyone believing that trickle down economics helps them..."

The temporarily embarrassed millionaire is like believing in the evil moon men, moronic beyond all reason and something which reasonably 99% of people dont believe. Hence why they always (wrongly) talk about trickledown/wealth creators/job creators, not ""you'll be a millionaire oneday"".

Edit: Ironically the comment you're defending in peak internet discussion.
