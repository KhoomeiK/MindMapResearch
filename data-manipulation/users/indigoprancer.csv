SuicideWatch,ffsz2ek,t3_euo34a,1580198585.0,It was your parents' fault to leave a dangerous object out with 5 years olds and not supervising you. What happened to baby proofing? If they are blaming you for 13 years for an accident which happened in your presence (you did not cause it) and THEIR absence they are not good parents. And the fact that you are suicidal because of them just goes to show they are the worst. Don't saceifice your life for them. They are not worth it. Give them hell. Live. And live well.
SuicideWatch,ffbtkor,t3_esr7o2,1579782252.0,"Aaah... Suicide used to be my Ultimate go to plan too whenever I got anxious. Now I have 2 wonderful dogs and a partner and I no longer wnt to kill myself which means my anxieties are severe. I panic a lot. But I wouldn't trade them for anything. Don't act on your suicidal thoughts. Find love, in animals. Their love is pure."
AskReddit,ffbqsas,t3_esjj44,1579778992.0,"I did not come into alot of money but when I got a decent job I applied for loan from a bank in hopes of buying some property(land) as an investment for future. This was after discussing with my mother who said she will look for properties i could purchase. The loan gets approved and my mother says she has been speaking to people about properties and that is that. Few weeks later I realize my mother hasn't spoken to me about any property. This was weird considering how many people call her and ask if she would like to invest in real estate. When I follow up she says she has been calling people(friends and relatives) and once she tells them it is for me (a 25 years old girl) they say they will find something and call back few days later saying I am too young to be buying property and that my future husbnd will do it for me but if I could lend THEM the money I have because <insert fake financial issues here> they willreturn it to me soon. They started visiting mom at home begging her for money and when my mom says she has already lended her money to them or that she has no more money they ask her when I would be home or to give them my number to speak directly to me. My mother was so angry and disgusted by their behavior that she broke off all ties with them.
I looked for properties on my own but a lot of property scams happen where I live. So when I got no help from my mom's ""friends"" I returned my loan(had to pay interest for a year). We no longer deal with such people. Mom has since purchased property through strangers now and I am still looking to purchase my own property."
SuicideWatch,fesne4i,t3_eqg8kz,1579367078.0,"My mother is like this. Once she continuously yelled at me for 2 days because I left the shampoo bottle open. When she brought it up first, i said it was a mistake and I will make sure I close it after use. But she kept the fight going. She yells and scolds me even if she boils milk and spills it, even the slightest inconvenience would be blamed on me. And when she is calm she would say it is because she is old n has a lot to worry about and is tensed so her behavior is such. Never once apologized. 
I always thought about suicide. Went into depression. Was depressed for 15 years! But then after a really big fight I realized, it is not her fault. The fault is mine. I gave her that power in my mind to hurt me. I let her get i to my head. Since then I stopped caring. I earned enough to move out and I go home once a month or so and she and I are best friends because she doesn't pick fight with me now else I won't go home or talk to her. The power dynamics have changed. I would suggest you do the same too. Keep calm and work towards moving away. It takes years to not care about someone you care deeply about. But taking a tiny step by making your mind up to not care and move out is a start and it is all good from there."
GhostStoriesNetflix,fcyjqo0,t1_fcwa8bf,1578081233.0,"Ok, I was confused initially too. But then it all made sense. She did not eat her baby. The nephew did nothing. The lady and the nephew are battling their own inner demons or ""ghosts"". They can be viewed as 2 separate storylines. The lady has lost a baby in the past after it was born. The child's death has haunted her ever since and she is dealing with it rather badly by worrying about her pregnancy and stuff due to past trauma(remember the scene where her mother says she will never be a mom?)  which is leading her to stress, have nighmares and finally miscarriage. The lady loses it after that and gets naked n plays with dolls while she is bleeding from miscarriage. The nephew, thinks about hurting the child because he has already lost his mom and does not want to lose his aunt and believes his aunt won't love him once the baby comes. The child gets absolutely no attention from his family with the exception of his aunt. Such children tend to misbehave to get attention to compensate for the lack of it. The kid, as creepy as he may seem, is just a kid who wants to be loved."
