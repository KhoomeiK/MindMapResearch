AskReddit,feqt7u0,t1_fepljpr,1579345736.0,"I think this is just a good insight as to how artists really aren’t invincible and the lifestyle takes its toll on them, as it would anybody. I think there are few that can really handle going around performing intense shows for hours multiple days a week, all year long. For years. Just the thought of that made me never want to be in a band. The fact that so many great performers get so damaged by it all just shows how rough it is to do that kind of work."

They need these specially made items because there aren't nearly enough for the tens of thousands of animals in critical care. So crochet away!

**EDIT**: first please consider donating to any of these organizations if you want to help: https://amp.news.com.au/technology/environment/bushfire-relief-how-you-can-help-those-in-need/news-story/a0476ac3538b8c373f281ea6be204421

Because I don't like to be one to spread misinformation, I should correct myself. They are fasting the first Sunday of the month, fasting for THE month, not A month. I'm an ex-mormon and I was furious when the whistleblower revealed that the church has 100 billion dollars in funds. My parents are devout Mormons and they currently live in poverty in a broken down trailer, yet still give a huge chunk of their income to the LDS church. To see them suffer financially is painful to me and theirs not much I can do now that I have a small family of my own. But the church continues to ask the members to fast and pray and give more money to the church, and that’s what upsets me. The church could donate 1/1000th of their funds to Australia and make a huge impact. 

So, if the LDS Church sees this, my message is here: if you truly care about the fires in Australia, make a donation from the funds you’ve ALREADY RECEIVED from the hundreds of years of tithes of the people you’ve taken it from. Stop asking for more from the poor. If you’re Mormon (or anyone else) and you truly want to help, donate to any of these direct organizations listed in this article here:  https://amp.news.com.au/technology/environment/bushfire-relief-how-you-can-help-those-in-need/news-story/a0476ac3538b8c373f281ea6be204421
