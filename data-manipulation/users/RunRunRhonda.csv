While I do think everyone is a little different when it comes to their personal optimal fat/protein/carb intake, I would really like to see a more broad recognition that a varied diet of whole foods is really best for everyone."
Coffee,fgmrxr4,t1_fgmrqfc,1580930825.0,I very much do.  Used to work in beer and wine.  I miss being able to snag my beloved CBS and other rarities as soon as they hit the shelves.  I've been out of the game for a bit...any new brews that are worth checking out?
Coffee,fgm2071,t1_fgldy6t,1580916356.0,I promise it is delicious.
