explainlikeimfive,fewy2t2,t1_fewtwp9,1579421259.0,"Ish, at least in comparison to the US parties. Successful immigration dogwhistles and the sustained campaign against unions has worked on the working class, and the rich oldies don’t want the middle class welfare introduced by Howard to end before they get theirs. So Labor’s reaction has been to go right, which to me is a fool’s errand that only erodes the support amongst the faithful, and will only work in Aus if Rupert deigns it to be. 

Problem is the Liberals are truly awful, and DiNatale is happy to spin off the affluent left vote that might have supported Labor once upon a time, so after their shock loss last year they’re pushing even harder into sustaining the established narrative"

worldnews,fdvw2iw,t1_fdvrzq9,1578752275.0,"I’m sure there was a sense of relief when they didn’t win unfortunately, but I’m not convinced they sacked it. Bill was pretty vocal about not wanting Albo to take over as leader: that may be unrelated and a personal beef, but there is no need for him to go hard against probably the most realistic replacement for him. Then again, that could be political theatre too. 

Likewise we pay lip service to Scotty having a minority government, but realistically he has Lambie, Hanson and “Centre Alliance”. That’s a majority for their agenda, even if we have to pretend otherwise.

You do have a point in that even the Libs assumed they were cooked. Pyne and Asbestos Julie jumped like rats, they snuck in a bunch of extra defence spending to tank Labor’s budgets etc. They also baked in a defence against Dutton taking over from a standing Prime Minister: they will not get a 2/3 majority to replace Scotty, even with his ineptitude over the fires. That said, they are definitely moving to prosecute an agenda sooner rather than later, and Scotty made sure to cut down the sitting days to limit resistance as well, but despite Hanson tricking them on the union bill they will push it again next year and get it over the line.

I think more likely is that we are witnessing the birth of the new propaganda model: Murdoch is the classic, Topham/Guerin and Lovedo(sp) are the new one, utilising a lack of critical thinking in the elderly and their inexperience with new technology to let FB tell their lies for them. Labor in Aus didn’t get steamrolled like they did in UK, which shows enough true believers still exist, but I worry all will be forgiven and forgotten by the next election.

I honestly don’t have the time and energy to go into how bad Di Natale is as both a leader and a potential Coalition partner, but the days of Labor showing any kindness to the Greens died with Bob Brown’s betrayal of Gillard. They lost their soul when Ludlam got rolled, and since then have tried to play kingmaker by making deals with the Liberal devils. Problem is you can never trust the Libs to act in good faith, and Di Natale had his pants pulled down over it a few times: how’d those senate voting changes work out, Richie? The Greens will become who young wealthy people vote for now that the Libs are cartoonishly evil, and their policy base will shift to match"

And mark my words, under DiNatale the Greens will go right. It will become the party that well off young people vote for because the Libs are cartoonishly evil at this point: it lost its soul when Scott Ludlam got caught up in the dual citizenship shenanigans.
