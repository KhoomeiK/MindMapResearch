AskReddit,fglxf1h,t1_fglpgy1,1580913282.0,"True, lm mostly talking about the ones that could have been easily prevented. For example, there was a bad accident near my house where two guys were speed racing. Each trying to pass each other to stay ahead. Well one passed around a blind corner and hit a car head on and killed them and themselves. 

So all these people died because of a pointless race."
AskReddit,fglq55a,t3_ez8vhq,1580907894.0,I knew him in highschool but didn’t start dating until I saw him again at my friend’s graduation party. Been together 14 years now.
AskReddit,fglpwic,t1_fglo0hr,1580907683.0,"Yeah me too, I didn’t really feel anything (my bf was kinda small) and then he disappeared afterwards. Idk if he was just ashamed it was so bad but as my first real love it was devastating."
AskReddit,fglpkxw,t3_ez8vj9,1580907394.0,Awkward. I’m not entire sure if my first time was legit since I couldn’t tell if it really went in our not.  My boyfriend was a bit on the small size
aww,fglmvy9,t3_ez8n7a,1580904815.0,"Cute, but is there a reason he’s tied up?"
AskReddit,fgkvddr,t3_ez2ybz,1580874471.0,"Open during the winter, closed during the summer (only if the AC is on) I also sleep with my feet closer to the door. A lot of people feel more comfortable lying this way because it’s the safest way to sleep. Its easier to defend yourself (or flee) if get attacked"
AskReddit,fgkuvqg,t3_ez2yi0,1580874141.0,"Once you’ve decided on the car, compare the prices with all the nearby dealers. You can even ask if they’d offer a lower price than a place you’ve already called. 

Of course the very best thing to do is wait until the end of the month or better yet the end of the season (when they about to sell the next year models. I got my car at this time and as well as price matching between dealers, I saved around $7000. 

Also don’t pay off the amount with cash (assuming you have that much money to buy it at the time) .But they’ll give you a better deal if you pay over time."
explainlikeimfive,fgkpusw,t1_fgiobhe,1580870977.0,I watched a documentary on a mother polar bear and her cubs. I was rooting for her the whole time as she defended her cubs from males and other challenges. It wasn’t until the end that it mentioned that they were filming multiple bears with cubs. I felt so betrayed. How dare they make us believe it’s all the trials of that *one* mom and babies. Nothing has ever been the same since

niceguys,fghmtxg,t1_fghgkso,1580788446.0,YES! Thank you very much :)
IdiotsInCars,fghmrbj,t3_eyjurz,1580788394.0,Was she drunk or high or something? why would she admit to running away and not having insurance?
AskReddit,fgfnbtm,t3_ey8fal,1580743214.0,"I’m not sure if this counts, but I once watched a video of four guys carrying a huge watermelon up a mountain just so they could feed some capybaras. Everyone there started taking pictures and were just so happy to see them eat. I’m not sure if it’s only humans but I think we definitely go above and beyond to take care of other animals. Especially if they’re cute"
