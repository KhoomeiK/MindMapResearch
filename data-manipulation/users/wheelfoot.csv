They are interesting in several ways:

1. They are adapted to live in our houses. They can survive the dry environment much better than outdoor spiders can (our houses are basically deserts for most spiders). 

2. They hunt other spiders in a very clever manner: *Certain species of these spiders invade webs of other spiders to eat the host, the eggs, or the prey. In some cases the spider vibrates the web of other spiders, mimicking the struggle of trapped prey to lure the host closer.*

3. If you scare them, they will bounce around in their webs like they're on bungee cords.
