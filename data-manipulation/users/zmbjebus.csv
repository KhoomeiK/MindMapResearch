If it was a drier year we would get less yield, but same amount of work put into it so it was still fine. 

We had to large of a space to garden the whole thing by hand, and to small of a space for it to be worth getting a tractor. All told we probably devoted around 100-150 sqft to it. 

One year we turned the whole thing into a 6 gallon batch of beer, with the mash becoming chicken treats.

Another year we turned it into flour, but that was less fun."

worldnews,ffa61t6,t1_ff940ub,1579728583.0,Contamination in recycling is one of the biggest challenges for recycling. So it is good that they are at least throwing out the contaminated bins. It is better to recycle less than mess up the whole truck it gets mixed with.
worldnews,ffa5t49,t1_ff9h8a7,1579728449.0,"Also consumers often don't have choices as far as packaging and other things like that. Even many retailers do not really have choices as far as that goes. 

As an example, I work at a small retail plant nursery, we receive plants (anything from veggie starts, to landscape plants, to houseplants) from mostly local growers (except houseplants). The plants themselves are fine, but they come in plastic pots, and the smaller ones are often recyclable flimsy plastic 4/6 packs. Trees come tied up with plastic twine, and most small plants have small plastic ID tags stuck in the pots. 

If one of the buyers is looking at options to buy from growers, its just a list of species, sizes, and prices. It doesn't mention that those 200 arborvitae you are buying are coming in wrapped up in plastic twine. Sure, one could shop around, or ask the suppliers to do something special for our nursery, but that is either not going to work, or drive up the cost for customers. And we really try to not make things expensive for people. 

It needs to be up to regulation to get producers to change their waste practices, not just making them pay for pollution, but also banning practices that could easily be replaced. In this case something like switching to hemp twine or w/e would fix the plastic part. I'm guessing switching to fiber pots for tomatoes and the like would increase cost, but that would be more realistic too."
