cars,ff79txd,t1_ff6q1ba,1579644108.0,"50,000 trucks in 2019. That's not insignificant. If anything, Frontier is probably an earner.  But margins, most likely. If they started doing the Navara domestically, that R&D is spent. They'd just need to reconfigure their line and supply-chain. And that's expensive. market analysis might not allow for them to sell more even if they updated.

>Sales of the Frontier, a truck that hasn't seen a significant refresh since 2004, saw a solid increase in sales in 2017 and 2018. Sales were up 7.1 percent, totaling 79,646 units. Despite that success, Titan sales were down 4.7 percent with 50,459 trucks sold while the NV dropped 5.4 percent to 16,902 units.

I absolutely agree. The only way Nissan fell short of toyota was aftermarket support. I had a 97 4wd.

I wish the windows were powered. And it had an extended cab. And I wish it had cruise control. But in the end, a poorly functioning air-conditioner and hail damage made it much more valuable to surrender to cash for clunkers."
