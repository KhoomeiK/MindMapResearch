But to answer your questions:

- Obviously depends on the Program, but I think you'd find few Graduate Level Programs which require you to complete Math courses to get the Degree. I got my Masters in Computer Science and there were no Math requirements to get the Degree. Now there may be some math incorporated into your technical courses, but its pretty basic, if you know basic algebra you'll be fine as a prereq, just learn as you go like I did. 

- Again, depends on the Program. At my University if you didn't have much of a Comp Sci background before Grad School, you'd have to take a few bridge courses in order to get caught up to speed. They didn't count towards your degree, but counted towards your GPA and lasted only a year. Different programs will have more specific policies and give you more specific information. In general, you should just know how to type.

- Look for Universities that are accredited as a CAE-CDE by the NSA/DHS. Full list [here](https://www.iad.gov/NIETP/reports/cae_designated_institutions.cfm).

There are several things they will evaluate when it comes to Foreign Travel

The most important thing when it comes to getting a Clearance is honesty. If you’re honest, your last indiscretions should be able to be adjudicated. If you try to adjudicative things yourself and hide things, you’ll probably get denied. 

The Government doesn’t expect you to be perfect, but they do expect you to be honest. Unless you’ve done something majorly wrong, you should be fine"
cscareerquestions,feomrzx,t3_eq81mg,1579302335.0,"Clearance at what level? [This](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2012-title32-vol1/xml/CFR-2012-title32-vol1-part147.xml) is the criteria for being granted one, I don’t know enough about your life to tell you if you’d be granted one or not, but things like Drug Use are common reasons people are denied. Gotta be careful about foreign influence as well such as extended travel abroad and things like that.

UMF,feof5bj,t1_feof13p,1579299275.0,"I’m actually surprised at how popular it is, it’s the most viewed EDM set ever on Youtube with 140 million views"

UMF,fens9ni,t1_fenqzqi,1579290049.0,"It sells out regardless. And there's still tons of uncertainty about Ultra and the City of Miami, phase 1 didn't drop too long ago and phase 2 hasn't dropped yet.

What makes sets iconic is the fact that you remember them years later. I couldn't remember a set from EDC 2013, but I still remember Hardwells and SHM's sets from Ultra 2013. And its not just me, look at the numbers these sets get online compared to EDC sets, Ultra blows them out of the ballpark. I'm only using Youtube as an example here because its an objective measurement of how these sets are received by Fans, i'm not just going off of how I or some other people personally feel."
UMF,feni9c1,t1_fenfgc5,1579285267.0,"I mean obviously all festivals have similar sets and DJ’s, but none of them are as iconic as Ultra Sets. Ultra has been home to some of the greatest sets ever. Don’t believe me? Look at the numbers type in Ultra Miami by view count and the top sets have tens of millions of views. It’s not even a comparison with any other festival outside of TML when it comes to sets and the Music

As someone who experienced the SHM set in 2018, sure there wasn’t any new music but having them back together and playing some classics and the entire experience and atmosphere were amazing. If Daft Punk came to Ultra and played some of their classics I’d be right there. VK was alright, but I personally liked Bayfront better

Ultra sells out tickets every year and I expect they will again this year. People do follow it wherever it goes"
UMF,fenesn9,t1_fendpe7,1579283140.0,"I can’t speak for anyone else, but I think it’s that Bayfront is so iconic with the Miami skyline and everything, that it’s hard to imagine Ultra somewhere else. Ultra at Bayfront has also been home to some of the most iconic sets in EDM history like the SHM reunion in 2018, Axwell and Ingrosso in 2017, Garrix in 2016, Hardwell at Ultra 2013, SHM in 2013 etc etc. No other festival has sets like that"
UMF,fendkg4,t1_fen5ok1,1579282393.0,"I’ve been to all three festivals. Personally, I don’t like the sundown to sunrise experience at EDC, and I could care less for the PLUR or Kandi stuff too. At a festival what I care most about is the music, and I think Ultra does a better job at that than EDC. Out of all three festivals, Ultra has the best lineups. I liked TML a bit more than Ultra, but I like Ultra more than EDC LV"

Define risky. There’s a strong need for Cybersecurity professionals, and that need won’t be fading away as society becomes more reliant on technology.

Department of Defense (DoD) is one of the 18 participating members of the Equities Review Board (ERB). Several of the departments and agencies on the ERB are represented by multiple component entities, including DoD, DHS, and DOJ. DoD, at the departmental level, is typically represented by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, but DoD components with unique technical and operational knowledge also participate and may vote separately in the ERB, including NSA, USCYBERCOM, and the DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3). It is important to note, however, that if there is disagreement about an ERB decision based on a non-unanimous vote, that issue can be elevated for higher-level decision through the process described in National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM)-4.
