It was shit, wouldnt recommend, I will never do it again either.

The first roll was obviously good, as any roll.

The second roll one day after the first roll. Quite a bit weaker than a normal roll, but still enjoyable. The day after was very bad though.

The 3rd and 4th roll were the worst I ever had. I was snorting mdma crystals, but barely felt anything. So I kept doing more, and stopped at around 400mg per roll. I barely felt it, maybe 10-15% of the normal effect.

I dont get it, every time I mention wanting big phones, I get downvoted into oblivion. Im not trying to take your small phones away, Im not trying to make every phone >80mm. Im just asking for ONE option in this size class.

I am absolutely aware that >90% of people dont want a >80mm phone. But you know what? The first galaxy Note was 83mm wide. And that was widely successful.

Im so fucking sick and tired of 95% of phones being 70-80mm wide. Why cant we have 60mm phones for r/android and 85mm phones for me? Why is wanting a tiny phone considered cool here, but wanting a big one is wrong?

Dont act like phones are actually getting bigger, they arent - they are just getting taller every year. I watch mostly 16:9 content though, I want WIDTH. I dont care if my phone doesnt fit inside an average persons hands. Im 1,91m and I want a big phone for my big hands, god damnit.

And to answer your question - yes, some people want a phone as big as this. The Mate 20X and Mi Max series have a lot of fans. All of those guys use 85-88mm phones. I dont give two shits if the average dude has trouble using it one handed - because I can, and thats all that matters to me."

>Geläufiges Kokain in D ist immer zu mindestens 50% Speed, das idR aus saisonal-regionaler EU-Landwirtschaft (Tschechien) nach D importiert wird. 

Sorry, aber das ist grober Schwachsinn. Gesnieft hält die Wirkung von Koks in meiner Erfahrung 40-60min und die Wirkung von Speed mehrere Stunden.

Wenn das Kokain dass ich schnupfe tatsächlich zu >50% aus Speed bestehen würde, müsste ich mal mindestens 2h einen aufputschenden Effekt haben - ist aber nicht so, nach der Stunde ist Schluss wenn ich nicht nachlege. Das schließt einen hohen Amphetamin-Anteil ganz klar aus.

Viel wahrscheinlicher ist, dass dein Koks (und auch Speed) stark mit Koffein gestreckt ist. Auch das ist aber relativ leicht herauszufinden. Reines Kokain/Speed sollte dich zwar wach, aber eben auch fokussiert werden lassen. Stark mit Koffein gestrecktes Zeug macht hingegen oft stark hibbelig."

I dont get it, every time I mention wanting big phones, I get downvoted into oblivion. Im not trying to take your small phones away, Im not trying to make every phone >80mm. Im just asking for ONE option in this size class.

I am absolutely aware that >90% of people dont want a >80mm phone. But you know what? The first galaxy Note was 83mm wide. And that was widely successful.

Im so fucking sick and tired of 95% of phones being 70-80mm wide. Why cant we have 60mm phones for r/android and 85mm phones for me? Why is wanting a tiny phone considered cool here, but wanting a big one is wrong?

Dont act like phones are actually getting bigger, they arent - they are just getting taller every year. I watch mostly 16:9 content though, I want WIDTH. I dont care if my phone doesnt fit inside an average persons hands. Im 1,91m and I want a big phone for my big hands, god damnit.

And to answer your question - yes, some people want a phone as big as this. The Mate 20X and Mi Max series have a lot of fans. All of those guys use 85-88mm phones. I dont give two shits if the average dude has trouble using it one handed - because I can, and thats all that matters to me."

>GelÃ¤ufiges Kokain in D ist immer zu mindestens 50% Speed, das idR aus saisonal-regionaler EU-Landwirtschaft (Tschechien) nach D importiert wird. 

Sorry, aber das ist grober Schwachsinn. Gesnieft hÃ¤lt die Wirkung von Koks in meiner Erfahrung 40-60min und die Wirkung von Speed mehrere Stunden.

Wenn das Kokain dass ich schnupfe tatsÃ¤chlich zu >50% aus Speed bestehen wÃ¼rde, mÃ¼sste ich mal mindestens 2h einen aufputschenden Effekt haben - ist aber nicht so, nach der Stunde ist Schluss wenn ich nicht nachlege. Das schlieÃŸt einen hohen Amphetamin-Anteil ganz klar aus.

Viel wahrscheinlicher ist, dass dein Koks (und auch Speed) stark mit Koffein gestreckt ist. Auch das ist aber relativ leicht herauszufinden. Reines Kokain/Speed sollte dich zwar wach, aber eben auch fokussiert werden lassen. Stark mit Koffein gestrecktes Zeug macht hingegen oft stark hibbelig."
