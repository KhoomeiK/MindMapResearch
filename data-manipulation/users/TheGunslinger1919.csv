Um... yes... sex, relationships, and sexual attraction are all based around the biological need to reproduce. Every single characteristic we find attractive in people is indicative of their ability to produce, protect, and provide for children. If that ""woman"" does not have the most basic parts necessary to do that, there's a pretty easy explanation why most guys won't be attracted to them. Ain't bigotry, just biology.

dankmemes,fdizssx,t1_fdhe4te,1578454849.0,"Was he ""commonly described"" as that before or after he was killed? Because I did look it up, and everything that I found that said that was after and made vague references to how ""some analysts"" considered him 2nd in command. That can pretty easily be chalked up to sensationalist journalism, considering ""US kills 2nd most important person in Iran"" will get you a lot more views than ""US kills another terrorist."" Maybe you could look it up and cite some sources this time, since you're the one making the claim. As far as what I found about him before he was killed, he was a popular public figure for sure in Iran (rumored to be running for president, which turned out false), but he seemed to hold more power on Iraq than Iran. Pretty much ran a lot of their puppet government organizations and didnt do a whole lot of actually running Iran.

And I would disagree with you there, it absolutely does matter that the world (not just the US, mind you) considers him a terrorist. Iran is angry but not stupid. They know that the chances of them actually winning a knock-down drag-out fight with the US are minuscule, even if it would be a tough fight for us. The only way their government could achieve any kind of scenario where they stay intact is if they have international support. And the chances of them having international support are pretty low if they're the ones starting a war over the killing of someone widely regarded as a terrorist. Combining that with the fact that there is mixed public opinion of their government and there's [already ongoing civil unrest in their country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019–20_Iranian_protests), it seems their regime is in a pretty precarious position and not really in a spot where they can afford to take gambles.

JustUnsubbed,fdfdree,t1_fdf1cr3,1578359314.0,"You've definitely got some good points and I agree with a lot of it, especially the stuff about community. I think the party system is more responsible (we've been divided by party lines pretty severely since the beginning, just look at the Civil War), but the loss of an in-person community and creation of echo chambers is a big part of the reason we are where we're at today, and I think has compounded the problem beyond what it should be.

I also (somewhat) agree on the charismatic monster thing you mentioned. I think the electoral college protects against that more than a two-party system does due to minimizing the effect the easily swayed uninformed masses have on the election, but I can see where the parties would be an added layer of protection.

Definitely disagree with a couple things too tho. The first and most major one is that it means that a majority of the country supports/voted for the sitting president. First of all, democracies usually have such a low voter turnout that it's nearly impossible to gauge if the majority of the country actually supports the elected official. If we did have 100% turnout, the Democrats would win every time just because they have a significantly higher number of people registered who will vote for them every time. On top of that, as I mentioned in my previous post, the two parties also encourage people to vote for someone they dont actually like as a candidate with the logic of ""at least they're not the other guy."" I personally would rather have someone that only 1/3 of the country voted for but those people genuinely believe in him as a candidate than someone who checked the 51% box but most of those people only voted for him because they don't like the alternative opponent.

I also disagree that it's a multi-party system or really encourages minority opinions. Sure, we have third parties and they can have some effect on the government by diverting votes and forcing issues and so on, but they never even come close to the level of sway that the two primary parties have over the country. And that unfortunately means that the only issues that get talked about are the ones pushed by the party, and the only solutions are proposed by the party who consistently refuse to work towards compromise. I think the Bernie-Hillary issue you mentioned is a good example of both points of view. On one hand, he definitely swayed her position somewhat and also forced her to see that she needed to appeal to the younger generations better (although the way she tried to do that was pretty laughable at times). But also, once she won the primary, a huge majority of the people who had so vehemently supported Bernie jumped on the Clinton bandwagon simply because they wanted a Democrat to win. Coupling that with the fact that the Democratic party's superdelegate system is essentially designed to give the nomination to the candidate the party officials want, not the actual people who voted, and it becomes pretty plain how easily this system can pressure people into supporting a candidate they might not actually want.

There are certainly both ups and downs to a two-party system, but I'm still not a fan of it and think the negatives outweigh the positives."
JustUnsubbed,fdeh071,t1_fde6601,1578338829.0,"If you believe the two-party system is good, I can respect that, though I'd definitely like to hear your reasoning. I personally am very against it, because I believe it is entirely responsible for the nutbags getting exposure and the decline of community you mentioned.

I think it encourages people to just go along with what their party says rather than think for themselves. It's easier for a person to just make their mind up on one issue that's important to them, pick the party that agrees, and then just always go along with that party no matter what. That's uninformed and irresponsible voting in my opinion.

Not only that, but it thrives off of polarizing people against each other. Their goal is to make you hate the ""other guy"" so much that you will always support your party over the competition, even if it doesn't make sense. Just look at the last election. I can't count how many people I knew that said ""I don't like Trump/Hillary, but I could never in good conscience vote for Hillary/Trump."" Seemed like everyone was just picking the candidate they hated the least (usually the one their party said was the least bad), and it shouldn't have to be like that. That's the kind of mentality they encourage, because no matter how bad their candidate is, their supporters will always vote for them because they'll say ""well at least they're not a Republican/Democrat.""

Finally, it dehumanizes people. Noone is willing to talk to each other and compromise anymore, because both of the parties have taken a line of ""we'll never compromise to the other guy!"" Then politics turns into a shit-flinging contest and nothing ever gets done. People just hate each other more and more over stuff that they dont even really care all that much about. That mentality also pushes people further and further towards extremism, something you also mentioned."
