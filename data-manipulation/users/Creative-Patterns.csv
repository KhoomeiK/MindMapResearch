I thought this did an excellent job of bringing the poetry around full circle, which gave the overall poem a satisfying sense of completeness. 

You started with the lead analogy, and brought in another element of nature (the wind) to remind us of where we began - by imagining this leaf sitting on the pond. 

The leaf can then easily blow away, just as the man was gone. 

I think this is amazing because we can imagine the leaf blowing, but can visualize where the leaf goes. At the same time, we cannot imagine where the man went because there is no context provided.

Entrepreneur,fec37d1,t3_eod86v,1578965990.0,"I welcome a heavy-handed critique of what I am about to write.

Start ups do not compete with larger companies. At least not initially.

To be frank, enterprise level operations will not even notice (or care) about a startup until it is no longer a startup.

Once their market share is diminishing, then they will care.

**First** the startup owns their niche. They establish a small pool of early adopters who are loyal to the startup, almost to a fault. This is accomplished through either amazing customer service or a spectacular product or service that is *just* different enough from the larger companies to be worthwhile.

**Next** the startup employs ramped up marketing to a specific location, or within their niche. They become such a powerful and formidable power within that area of the country or within their specialization that a larger company with countless revenue streams, employees, and activities simply cannot get down to their exact level of specificity.

**Lastly** they have either a patented or proprietary element and are *uncompromising* on quality while they scale up.

With a rock solid foundation and a loyal clientele base, the startup will not be a startup for long.
