tumblr,fgoacg1,t3_ezir7u,1580963805.0, Mine asked me the same thing and I said “I dunno? I don’t even know where the man is. Hopefully in prison somewhere where I will never see him again.” This is also a correct answer.

AskMen,fgnv1xi,t1_fgmg8ju,1580953524.0,"My partner of 8 years is still unsure of my birthday and when I ask him when it is he laughs and won’t answer me. It’s a running joke now. I know he remembers it now, but for a few years he legit couldn’t remember. lol. I think he finally put it in his phone calendar with a reminder. It’s funny and strangely endearing."

AskReddit,fglzxq5,t1_fgkozja,1580915009.0,I give them fake credit card numbers that are used for testing software. You can get as many as you want from a free generator online. One time I had a guy on the phone for nearly 30 minutes just trying one number after another. He eventually realized that it wasn’t going to work when they kept getting declined over and over so he told me to contact my banking and credit organization and then call him back and hung up on me. He was very unfortunate to have called me on a day off when I had time to kill and was in a “fuck you” mood. lol
AskReddit,fglz9og,t1_fglamra,1580914558.0,"I have tested this and 100% agree.

technology,fgl9k5x,t3_eywaxj,1580887038.0,"Yeah, we’re done with AT&T. After being with them for ~15 years for phone service our whole family switched to Cricket last month because the bill was just ridiculous and service was terrible. I have so much better service now, which is funny because people always told us that companies like Cricket and Metro don’t work as well as AT&T."
ProgrammerHumor,fgl7kgr,t1_fgkcoop,1580884784.0,I work for a company that makes clinical software for psychologists and psychiatrists.

AdviceAnimals,fgbb1z1,t1_fgbaemx,1580660268.0,"It probably won’t do anything. The sad thing is that I tried to use another free service and there was a major difference in the amount of the return they said I would get. Turbo tax calculated my return to be at least $1000 more after testing several tax sites. I don’t know how, but they get me more money..."
AdviceAnimals,fgba1tc,t1_fg8oq60,1580659915.0,"I just filed with them and they upped it to $40 for using turbo tax and then $40 for filing. So I paid $80 total. I didn’t care when it was $40 because they did help when I was audited and let me refile for free, but damn. $80 for the same damn product.

They will get as big as a medium (20-25lbs) turkey if allowed to become full grown. So heavy that their legs will break under their own weight (yes, I had one do this.) As for the male egg layers, why not let them grow up and then slaughter them like any other small meat chicken?
