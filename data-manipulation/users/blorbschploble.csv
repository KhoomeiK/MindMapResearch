The hand wavy answer is ìthe electron is somewhere where itís motion doesnít result in emitting radio waves and decay in its orbit, because it literally canít emit quanta smaller than *h*f, itís not just falling into the nucleus because that requires having juuuuuuuuust the right energy to do weak force shenanigans with nucleons (that is generally very improbable due to Z and W boson stuff..), and itís not escaping because it needs some multiple of energy deposited on it by a photon to get kicked out. (Yay photoelectric effect!)î

Itís weird but basically it has to be true or I will fall to the floor into the center of the earth as my electrons give off radio waves until they collapse into protons and turn into neutrons. (The earth would be similarly collapsing)"
explainlikeimfive,ff7hzb3,t1_ff6bkji,1579649989.0,"Way worse than that actually. If you had the equipment to do so, you could try to very precisely measure the location of an electron using a photon with enough energy to make matter-antimatter pairs. One of those could annihilate with the original electron. 

In neutron diffraction, I donít really think you can ìhitî an electron with a neutron, but if you did, itíd be like hitting a fly with a baseball. 

The ultimate version of this is smashing two protons together to try to see their quarks. The energy you put into the system to do that is enough to generate whatever quarks to preserve color charge.

You will then cum and have 15 seconds of clarity. Then youíll be haunted by the recognition that if the afterlife is real, Mr. Rogers saw you masturbate, but consoled by the fact he still thinks you are worthy of love. 

Then youíll remember some kid just got given to another family for basically no reason and scarred the rest of the family, which they could have prevented by masturbating instead of having so many kids. 

Then youíll wonder if masturbation should be a categorical imperative. 

You will then develop time travel in order to teach humans how to masturbate in the past. Unfortunately, they see you are circumcised and learn the wrong lesson.

You will then cum and have 15 seconds of clarity. Then you‚Äôll be haunted by the recognition that if the afterlife is real, Mr. Rogers saw you masturbate, but consoled by the fact he still thinks you are worthy of love. 

Then you‚Äôll remember some kid just got given to another family for basically no reason and scarred the rest of the family, which they could have prevented by masturbating instead of having so many kids. 

Then you‚Äôll wonder if masturbation should be a categorical imperative. 

You will then develop time travel in order to teach humans how to masturbate in the past. Unfortunately, they see you are circumcised and learn the wrong lesson.

You contemplate your failure but then realize that enshrining a religious prohibition against child sacrifice you have saved millions of kids int the future.
