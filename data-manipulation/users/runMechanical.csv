news,feyy73j,t1_feyqvkp,1579451912.0,"yep. this situation is a terrible one but the entire thread had a knee-jerk emotional reaction to it as they do every other hot-button debated topic these days. they never think about what their idealistic solutions cost the innocent. 

itt: guilty until proven innocent."
news,feywjy2,t1_feyng2h,1579451403.0,"you've totally just missed the point. you can't argue against his scenario by saying it's not abuse because the police wouldn't know that until an investigation happens. in this scenario, the child has actually made the accusation of abuse. his entire point is you can't just accuse someone of something and expect a full investigation to occur.

let's say you absolute despise your neighbor for no reason. if you call the police and claim they stole your weedwacker, for example. you can't expect the police to simply go search their house. the onus is on you to provide proof first.

it's terrible that some people need to wait until they have proof before an actual abuser can be caught, but you can't just expose every single innocent person in the world to compulsory criminal investigations."

to continue your thought: if, tomorrow, every single cashier quit their job and tried to find a desk job they were capable of doing, we wouldn't have any cashiers. the day after tomorrow, every store that needs a cashier would put out job postings for a higher pay than what they paid to all those that quit. eventually the pay is high enough that enough people are content to work as cashiers and all the jobs are filled. as more and more want to become cashiers for the higher pay, the companies find there are more people who want to work as a cashier than they need, so they are able to reduce the hiring pay rate and still employ enough cashiers.

all this might not seem ""fair"" from a surface level, but a consensual employment contract between two parties for an agreed-upon rate and an agreed-upon job is the most fair situation possible."
