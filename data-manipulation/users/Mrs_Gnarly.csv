2- he is probably acting on his own issues and how he was raised, but it is no excuse. He's old enough to not shit himself so he's old enough to control his temper

3- get out of that situation as soon as you can. Get a job work hard save up your money and make a life for yourself that you deserve. You are human who deserves to be treated with respect. 

4- disagreements happen all the time, but reactions are what make us human and control is what keeps our humanity. 

5- speaking from personal experience it's hard. I was raised with a family that yelled and beat on each other. So there was always beatings and verbal abuse. So now as an adult it comes out and I don't always catch it. But being aware of those negatives and putting an effort towards fixing it matters. Your papa knows what he is doing is wrong. It's impossible to think it's ok to physically harm a child/human in any aspect. Though he may not want to change or want to put the effort. But you do, so you know that you want to be a better person.

6- grin and bare it until a better life options comes. Don't let your resentment/hatred/anger grow in you. People are temporarily in your life, and though now it may seem difficult to understand when they are not in your life anymore it will make u a stronger person. It's a difficult decision to step away from family but at the end of the day you need to take care of yourself and never feel guilty for looking out for yourself.

Hope this helps!"

I miss it desperately, it was the only way I felt okay with feeling nothing. I live day by day doing what I need to do. Work. Home. Sleep. Repeat. It will be a nice change to be interacting on my terms. Your words are very helpful. I'm glad you've shared it."
depression,fchzsqo,t1_fchydkt,1577656065.0,"I'm gonna get the help I need. My biggest fear is maybe I wont be helped. Maybe I wont realize anything. Or maybe I'll realize too much and it will do more harm than good. Im comforted by talking about it on this post. Realistically, without expectations it's easier to accomplish things even the small joy of communication. Thank you."
