prusa3d,ffj8lc2,t1_ffj4xg5,1579993028.0,"Yes, and I had said as such. 

And the prusa website leaves out the fact that acetone will damage the sheet, smooth or otherwise with repeated exposure. Many people have came here complaining that their sheets have been damaged by the acetone despite them (albeit usually overzealously) simply following the instructions on the website and in the manual."
prusa3d,ffj5g86,t1_ffj4kz0,1579990874.0,"You should be able to clean it pretty well with isopropyl alcohol. What are you putting on it that would not be soluble in alcohol?

Try not to touch the print surface with your hands as they mention in the manual and keep it dust free...

The only thing you should be putting on your PEI sheets is isopropyl, water, window cleaner or seperating agents like glue sticks... all of these are soluble in alcohol or water. If you get dust or skin oil on there it's also soluble in alcohol or water (for the most part). My point is it shouldn't be hard to clean it with just some iso and a paper towel

Perhaps you're using a cloth or something that is leaving residue? When I started I used a microfiber cloth and some iso. But after a time the cloth either started to leak chemicals or residue onto the board, maybe it was the dye they used to color the cloth or something... or maybe reusing the cloth meant it built up a lot of residue from prior cleanings and was smearing it around...

When I switched to a brand new clean paper towel it was fine. But for a time it literally would not stick at all, surprisingly so, before I did that. So it does make a difference. Make sure you're using a new clean cloth and it's not got any additives like perfumes. Should be an unscented clean paper towel fresh off the roll (don't have to use a perfectly new one EVERY time but if you're having problems its a good check).

Acetone is used for ""rejuvenating"" your PEI sheets, as Prusa calls it, because (afaik) it removes the top layer of PEI by eating away at it, and therefore you end up with the clean unblemished surface below which is ideally flat. But you can only do this so many times until the PEI sheet becomes damaged.

Recommend avoiding acetone as long as you can and using it as a last resort, removing it quickly after using it

Also you should try to print in an area without wind or airflow. If you have airflow from a vent or something by your printer it will affect the print by cooling it unevenly. Maybe that's got something to do with your warping. Are you printing with a warp-prone material (something with shrinkage characteristics)? You shouldn't be having warping with PLA

If you're having bed adhesion issues it's probably not cleanliness that's the issue - you're probably printing on an uneven surface or it's not heated well or evenly or something like that... iso should be more than good enough to clean the surface... use 99% so there's no water in it, sometimes water has minerals and that affects adhesion if you're using any water.."

socialanxiety,ffj0qj4,t1_ffhndoj,1579987471.0,"I have this weird anxiety thing where I need to keep my work separate from my personal life. 

Whenever I think about work I get a little anxious and idk, whenever I work on my hobbies at work or when I was in school, it always kinda ""ruined"" them for me if that makes sense. It turned something I did for fun into something that was a job, with obligations and deadlines and stuff.

It's a little extreme for me, probably worst than most people's because I go so far as to hide my work things out of sight when I get home so I don't accidentally look at them during the weekends or my off time.

I try to completely ""turn off"" when I'm home and push work conpletely out of my head. My off time is my free time and I made it pretty clear to my employer I don't answer work calls or emails while home. 

But I'm a little bit excessive like that, and if you don't have these limitations/preferences or whatever then by all means do what you love to do. 

Personally I use my income to fund my hobbies, and that's where my enjoyment of life comes from. Work is just a tool to procure money for me to enjoy my life - not my reason for living.

But everyone is different and I suppose that's something you'll have to decide for yourself :)"
