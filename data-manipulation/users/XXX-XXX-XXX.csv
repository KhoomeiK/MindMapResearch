I have dreams of playing a piano.  When i was born my great grandfather said i had the fingers for it.  Whenever i sat down to learn, i felt like it was literally draining my energy.  I could play fine, but the moment i sat on the bench my mind would empty and I'd feel mentally exhausted.  I still have fantasies of impressing people on the piano, and even getting gigs.  Reality is that i dont like it as much as i think i do.  Now i play bass guitar and love every second of it.
