He was all over televised national debates in 2016. He's been in the news, weekly, since then. He's been campaigning for months talking about all of this - yet he's only gained support. Nothing groundbreakingly new is learned, only that it's a formalized plan on what he will do immediately, not over the course of his presidency. But for years, and to everyone, none of this is new or a surprise.

This is speculation, and if true, numbers wouldn't show he's making overall gains in independent and left leaning supporters.
