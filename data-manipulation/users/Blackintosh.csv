There is a legal way to make guaranteed money out of betting sites (assuming you have the self control not to place bets with any chance of loss)

Its called matched betting, and it exploits the use of free bet sign-up offers to betting sites, alongside the use of a betting exchange which is a place were you can put your own money up against other people's bets.

If you work your way through every betting site with a sign up offer, you can earn around £1000 very easily in the first month or so. Once those offers are exhausted, you will only make an easy 50-100 a week based on how many ""plz come back"" emails you get, alongside the weekly bet clubs.
