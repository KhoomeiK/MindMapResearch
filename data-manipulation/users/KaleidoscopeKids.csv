How do you feel about that? It seems to me that the devil is in the details here. I see consent to reproduction and consent to a specific sexual activity as two distinct things. Rape, is specifically non-consensual sexual activity. Tricking someone into unprotected sex is a non-consensual sexual activity, but not taking your birth control medication?

You're completely ignoring my argument. FERTILIZATION OF AN EGG IS NOT A SEXUAL ACT. The sexual act of penetrating a vagina, with a penis, and ejaculating semen into said female reproductive system can occur with or without consent. To perform that act (and other sexual acts) without consent is rape. And the use of one's genetic information to produce a viable fetus can occur with, or without, consent. Fraudulently using someone's genes to produce a child is unethical (I think). But use of genetic information is not a sexual act -- the congress was the sexual act. Fertilization can, and often does, occur even a significant time and distance from any sexual actor involved in the initial production of said gametes.

Let's give another example (although I'm sure I'll just be burying the lead even further). Let's say that I hate my neighbor and want to hurt him. So I ask him ""hey, can I borrow your car this weekend?"" with the full intention to crash his vehicle the first opportunity I get. My neighbor, well meaning and ignorant of my plan, tells me to go ahead ""no problem, it's all yours this weekend"". Later, I crash the car. 

Did I *steal* the car? No. The act of giving the car was free and voluntary -- theft requires that the act of giving be forced or under coercion. But did I unethically *defraud* my neighbor. Maybe. It could be said that the implication in the exchange was that I would do my best to return the car in top condition.  Perhaps even that expectation was stated explicitly. Nevertheless, my unethical behavior does not equate *theft*. The nature of rape (as theft), concerns the consent of the actors *during* the act."

1. Your jizzem is not ""part of you"" -- in the sense that it is not afforded any of the rights that you enjoy. See also: your shit and piss. That's both gross, rhetorically indefensible, and certainly not rape.

2. Nobody is talking about ""taking"" semen against anyone's will. In both the case in the video, and any other other scenarios I've seen here, the semen provider (I can't believe I'm having this discussion) is not being forced or coerced into the sexual act. They may well be the primary instigator of the act. Taking a biological sample from someone against their will violates their bodily autonomy. Doing something nefarious with a sample freely given may be unethical (as fraud), but it is not *sexual* assault."
videos,ff7f5nv,t1_ff7c2un,1579648127.0,"I'm not sure from where you're drawing the terms ""reproductive coercion"" or ""birth control sabotage"". They certainly aren't legal terminology. There is not a right to ""reproductive autonomy"" (whatever that means) -- there is only a recognized right to bodily autonomy. And this is the main point, that material that you have consensually removed from your body does not maintain the same bodily privileges that your person is entitled to.

If we're talking about *rape*, then we're talking about consent and sexual behavior. The taking of medication has no bearing on the sexual behavior -- no aspect of the encounter is altered. Conversely, the modification of when, where, and how penetration occurs (with the organ, with an inanimate object, etc) is the direct focus of the sexual assault discourse.

Ultimately the effects of the two acts are the same (a pregnancy without two consenting parties), but because the current philosophical (and legal) precedent on rape surrounds the sex act, one act of subterfuge may be considered rape, and other not. See also my example above, which also differentiates between the circumstances in which the genetic information is obtained, and what is done with that information."
