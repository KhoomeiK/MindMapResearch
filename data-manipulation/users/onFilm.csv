If perhaps you were a reasonable individual, who still disagrees with me, I would totally make a post on Vancouver about that, since you've kinda inspired me to see just how many others do just as I do. But I can already tell that no matter what is put up online or said, you're going to have your own head in your behind and keep on calling me a liar and simply not believing it, so what's the use. Makes me wonder what type of person you are in real life, what it is that you do and how you handle situations on the everyday. Something tells me that it's not so pretty. You simply want to win an argument by pushing your own agenda forward, and that honestly is not civil discourse. 


See how you keep forcing people to do things that come from your own self? And if it's not done the way you want it, you simply reiterate to your own points."
JusticeServed,fg15kbk,t1_fg153u0,1580421182.0,"Criticizing is disapproving with someone, not getting them to forcefully change their answer to align with what you see fit. What you are doing is definitely fueled by rage as you're going on about other points not relevant to what is being discussed. It feels as if you're loosing a bit bud.


Now you're assuming people are calling a psychopath, I mean what. Where is this coming from? Maybe try to describe your frustration a bit better in a more calm manner. No need to freak out.

Calling people 'kid' is a little alarming. How old are you exactly to be behaving as you are? I think you need to stop raging, and if you don't believe someone, call them out and move on. You're getting all personal up in here and still have not explained what your issue is; you just keep crying out 'liar, liar'.


I knew you wouldn't want to converse in voice chat, because there are many people like yourself online. If you really wanted to criticize and resolve this, you'd be willing to put in the time and effort to communicate properly. All you're doing is getting your own panties tied up in a knot, because other people's world-view does not align with your own.

But now that I've gone through your comment history, it makes sense why you're acting the way you are. I do hope you get the help you deserve buddy. I'm not sure why you're projecting onto others when you clearly have to resolve your own issues.


If you really want to continue this discussion, why don't you pass me your details so we can continue this conversation through voice chat, if you're really that concerned.

It feels a lot more free here since you can get away with a lot more than in Canada where I grew up, hence the obvious corruption from all angles. If you have money, you can get away with murder a lot cheaper than a county such a Britain, Canada or the US. Drugs are more accepted here (again because of money) and everyone feels like they are more servetory than on the same ""social level"". People are also a lot more open and welcoming and everyone wants to know what you're up to, leasing to a greater feeling of cultural ""warmth"". You can chat up strangers about anything and it's a everyday normal occurence. But there is also a lot more crime, especially in poorer areas."
