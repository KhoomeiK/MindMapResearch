In addition to programming systems themselves, a Senior/Lead Engineer / Lead Programmer is going to be in charge of defining coding standards, giving implementation time estimates, code documentation, reviewing work from other coders, and usually administering source control.

A PM / Producer / Lead Designer is going to handle the hiring & firing, timeline, scope adjustments, design documentation, technical art documentation, and any drama that may crop up as the artistic and logical clash.   


In my opinion, both of these roles need to be filled by someone great at their work. PMing requires excellent communication skills, organization, and creativity while Lead Programmer requires a lot of programming experience in the specific engine they're working with, a solution focused mindset, and a humble attitude. Not many people have all of those traits so it makes sense  I've never met a great programmer that is also a great PM in game dev. They are typically going to work in higher paying fields.

The PM will do a deep dive on features with you and assemble a list of positions that need to be filled to realize the vision. 

The classic mistake is assuming you can fill this role with no experience. You will hire a 2D artist, programmer, and 3D artist and find that they can't get anything done or that their art is not optimized or code is not solid / documented. You need someone with an understanding of these things to communicate with you as you assume the Executive Producer role.
