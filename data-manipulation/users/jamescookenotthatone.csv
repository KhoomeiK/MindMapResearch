SelfAwarewolves,ffynzs6,t3_evudhb,1580350959.0,"There is also the famous effort by the Nazi government to privatize many state owned companies, but that was just so the government could raise funds for rearmament and likely would not exist in the post war society. The Nazis also went on to dissolve many companies that did not politically align with them, forbid the creation of new companies, and banned foreign stock trade. The economy really was a means to an end, like everything else, for the Nazis."

This allowed a person to produce a news paper in London on Monday night and have it on the street corners through out the country the next morning. This led to a few major companies dominating the entirety of the news publishing industry as local publishers couldn't really compete. A few news barons cropped up and have been competing with each other, largely by creating either the most consumerist non-news product possible, producing incredibly biased works to meet a niche audience, or just propagating their own beliefs.
