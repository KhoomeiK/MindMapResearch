gaming,fef3cca,t1_feevazw,1579047202.0,"The only thing I want is the sense of adventure. The loot you found felt meaningful. Unlike Oblivion or Skyrim where at a certain level all of the random bandits were wearing full daedric gear. In Morrowind you could go to the few places where mobs had daedric gear, and if you could manage to kill them or steal it you felt like you deserved it, because it was possible to kill anything in that game at level one. A lot of the loot is leveled in Skyrim, so a unique weapon you found at level 6 would soon be worthless, and if you just wait until level 30 it's actually now decent. The problem people had with Morrowind was the really strict hit miss algorithm for damaging things with melee weapons. The answer was always that your skill was really low compared to your mobs skill, because making a class with out understand the very confusing and never fully explained skill system made you end up with a long blade skill that was only 30, but you are using a short blade with a skill if 5 because you weren't aware that the difference mattered that much. Also finding stuff for quests was ridiculous, but to me that made it great because I would find so many other mysterious things when I was out looking for the quest locations. Morrowind had surprises in the craziest places that were actually unique and interesting."

Sore throat that got so bad I couldn't eat, couldn't talk couldn't drink water. Apthous ulcers over nearly every square inch of my mouth and tongue. Went to the doctor, they did every kind of blood and swab test they could think of, they were stumped. They put me on some crazy steroid type medicine for extreme cases of this or that.

I was trying to vape while driving and it was dying so I was getting nothing, I started to rage in anger and threw the piece of shit out the window, one advantage with cigarettes is they can't get a dead battery, so I rolled into a walgreens and bought some camel lights. The rush you get after not smoking for 3 weeks is heavenly. I woke up the next day and was almost completely cured. Turns out I am insanely allergic to whatever the hell they put in vape juice. Ive had dozens of self proclaimed science experts, after I told them why I can't be near vapes because I am crazy allergic try to tell me that ""you can't be allergic to vapes"" ""its just vegetable glycerin and polypropylene glycol, its food grade!"". Fuck all of that, If that shit wasn't about to kill me, I was going to blow my own brains out. I spent 2 grand on pointless tests and suffered for weeks because some one was like, hey ever tried vaping? Just a suggestion. The doctors don't know shit about vaping and not one even asked if I vaped while testing me for every disease and cancer they could think of. They even told me quitting smoking can trigger mouth ulcers because of a change in ph balance in your mouth or some nonsense, it was almost like telling me I was allergic to quitting smoking. And then hindsight, all of those days spent huddled in the little covered area at my work with all of those chads blowing fat clouds of fruit loop bullshit in my face made me sick as well, just no where near to the degree I got sick sucking it down myself.

Unlike Oblivion or Skyrim where at a certain level all of the random bandits were wearing full daedric gear. In Morrowind you could go to the few places where mobs had daedric gear, and if you could manage to kill them or steal it you felt like you deserved it, because it was possible to kill anything in that game at level one. A lot of the loot is leveled in Skyrim, so a unique weapon you found at level 6 would soon be worthless, and if you just wait until level 30 it's actually now decent. The problem people had with Morrowind was the really strict hit miss algorithm for damaging things with melee weapons. The answer was always that your skill was really low compared to your mobs skill, because making a class with out understand the very confusing and never fully explained skill system made you end up with a long blade skill that was only 30, but you are using a short blade with a skill if 5 because you weren't aware that the difference mattered that much. Also finding stuff for quests was ridiculous, but to me that made it great because I would find so many other mysterious things when I was out looking for the quest locations. Morrowind had surprises in the craziest places that were actually unique and interesting."

The rush you get after not smoking for 3 weeks is heavenly. I woke up the next day and was almost completely cured. Turns out I am insanely allergic to whatever the hell they put in vape juice. Ive had dozens of self proclaimed science experts, after I told them why I can't be near vapes because I am crazy allergic try to tell me that ""you can't be allergic to vapes"" ""its just vegetable glycerin and polypropylene glycol, its food grade!"". Fuck all of that, If that shit wasn't about to kill me, I was going to blow my own brains out. I spent 2 grand on pointless tests and suffered for weeks because some one was like, hey ever tried vaping? Just a suggestion. The doctors don't know shit about vaping and not one even asked if I vaped while testing me for every disease and cancer they could think of. They even told me quitting smoking can trigger mouth ulcers because of a change in ph balance in your mouth or some nonsense, it was almost like telling me I was allergic to quitting smoking. And then hindsight, all of those days spent huddled in the little covered area at my work with all of those chads blowing fat clouds of fruit loop bullshit in my face made me sick as well, just no where near to the degree I got sick sucking it down myself.
