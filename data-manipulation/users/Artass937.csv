depression,ffstuem,t1_ffiopwq,1580192255.0,"In my grandma's words: ""I am not going to just sit and watch while you're life is going to sh*t."" I can understand why she did it. I guess if i were in her shoes, i might have done the same.
I've done some research on therapy prior to this, so i am aware of some common facts about it. But, never have i thought of having to schedule an appointment myself. I guess that the suddeness of this situation is what overwhelemed me. 
Anyway, thank you for the kind words and i'll be sure to check out those links. Have a nice day :)"
depression,ffdv4ab,t3_et2xnq,1579829686.0,"Nope, days can pass without any depression episode. Also there are days in witch depression won't leave me alone. But i can't predict when i will be ""ok"" and when depression hits. And when it does hits, its usually ""Aw sh\*t... here we go again"" moment."
depression,ffdum6l,t3_et2pvl,1579829325.0,"You need to have serious talk with your family about the way you feel. I know how hard it is to put the ""happy face"" away, but if you try to lead this ""life"" so your parents can brag about your diploma or whatever... the depression will slowly suck the life out of you, leaving nothing but empty husk of yourself."
depression,ffdsx26,t3_et2c13,1579828115.0,"I know how you feel. You know what you can expect from depression. Its been with for years now. Its like a perverted ""comfort"" zone. Over time you just got used to depression, and living with it seems so normal, you literaly cannot imagine living a life another way."
depression,ffdrbbd,t3_eswd3w,1579827018.0,"I am an introvert by nature, so a bit of loneliness is nothing i can't handle. However depression took the isolation and brought it to a whole new level. Now, days can pass without me having any contact with anyone whatsoever. And when someone actually decides to talk to me, its because they usually want something from me. The loneliness i am going through is almost unbearable. Only coping mechanism i have against it, is any distraction i can find. Usually its playing video games or watching whatever on netflix."
depression,ffdpuho,t3_essxe0,1579826095.0,"Wow, that is disturbingly close to how i feel. Anyway, i am happy you found the strength to open up to someone. Wish you best with the therapy."
depression,ffa69lm,t3_esgot1,1579728701.0,"For me it started when i felt i was loosing control over myself. I started cutting myself as way to have at least control over something. And as strangely as that may sound, the physical pain i was causing to myself, felt better than whatever was boiling inside me. It gave me something else to think about for a moment."
depression,ffa5h8o,t3_esbcpa,1579728267.0,"(26m) That is how i feel in a nutshell. But you need to understand, that this is just depression talking and giving you ""excuses"" why you should not bother finding the love of your live. Everyone has diferend prefferences when it comes to finding a partner, but usually we are not looking for someone that is perfect in every way. We are looking for someone that sees us for what we are and loves us for it. That is my opinion anyway."
depression,ff7w4vx,t3_es3u84,1579659773.0,"In my opinion, few tears is a small price to pay for help you want. And about the drugs, i don't think the first course of action would be to call the police. Doctors and therapists included are under oath witch protects your privacy. I don't think they would involve police, but they will most certainly try to help you get clean."
depression,ff7ua7s,t3_es3x5j,1579658523.0,"Its possible. Its not unusual to suffer from both depression and anxiety. Also some symptoms you mentioned suggest you may be depressed. However, i can't say for sure since i am not a proffesional."
depression,ff7sm11,t3_erytu7,1579657364.0,"Depression packs quite a punch, doesn't it. Thing is, you can't win this battle alone."
depression,ff7rby9,t3_ervxoz,1579656477.0,"Well, any form of self-harm leaves some sort of mark on you. Cuts and burns will leave you with scars for everyone to see. But, that or s not going to stop anyone who uses self-harm as coping mechanism."

depression,ff72wrz,t3_es0is1,1579640045.0,I would love to have something like that too. That fantasy almost brought a tear to my eye.
depression,ff71upn,t3_eruu6o,1579639453.0,"That's some heavy stuff. However, if one of my friends said something like this to me, i would just turn around and leave without saying anything in return. True friend would never said something along those lines. I know this must hurt, but trust me, you will probably be better off without him."
depression,ff6ozsa,t3_eru9q7,1579631865.0," I have been thinking about this ""policy"" in a past few years and truly, it seems a bit unfair. We have been given life, without asking for it, and we are denied to end it. Doesn't matter how painfull our existence get, we are forced to live in ""hope"" that things get better. And no matter what we say, things always get better. Over time, i got sick of hearing this. I guess if i wanted to kill myself, there is very little anyone can do about it. But i would like to know, why am i not allowed to take my own life."
depression,ff669ub,t3_ern1iv,1579620148.0,"For me, its not just about cleaning. Anything that can be considered as choore, even something as small as go out to buy some groceries or just taking a shower sometimes feels like something impossible. At this point i am not sure if its because of depression or if i am just lazy af."
depression,fc3f0e3,t3_efukvu,1577388351.0,"I do it too. Its a form of a defence mechanism helping me cope with depression and pain that comes with it. However, some people are not fond of my dark sence of humor."
