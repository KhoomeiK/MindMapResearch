I personally believe that the asking party should do the paying (or go Dutch, it's 2020 ffs) but this is way out of line. Really nice girl but this is some wtf behavior."

If the pastor doesnt have a sound argument for his beliefs, why should I believe in them as well?

We're working on our thesis together, so obviously I'm going to accompany you down to the projects to check out the murder scene. Of course, she's telling the leading character that they need to back off the whole time, but the main character in all her white wisdom refuses to.

TwoXChromosomes,fdpmpor,t1_fdp1als,1578633017.0,"While I agree with both of you, I think _Atom is trying to see things from OP's husband's perspective. He doesnt have a job in the traditional capacity, no, but he's been tasked with molding another human being, which is arguably more important than being the breadwinner. Judging by what information we have, I would agree that he sees being at home with the baby as inferior which is another huge issue in and of itself. 

Or we could be missing a link and he has massive insecurity from an ex/his parents/who knows, but I'd put money on this at least playing a part."

Some of my coworkers (all male) will ask my advice on hitting on girls who come in. 99% of the time I say it's a bad idea, especially with our misogynistic asshole racist boss who's always asking girls for their numbers, then being sad about getting ""friendzoned again"". I personally ascribe to the belief that if you use the term ""friendzone"", you've done some pretty heinous stuff and deserve to rot there. The one time I did encourage a coworker to go for it was after hearing that they used to hang out often and run in the same circles in high school. They have a history that implies his asking her out would not affect her comfort shopping at our store."
