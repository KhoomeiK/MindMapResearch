AskProfessors,ff2j91j,t1_ff2grqd,1579508614.0,">Students are always challenging their grades, complaining about class policies etc. (Sometimes the parents complain as well.)

Most students make their complaints directly to the professor. I have had two grade appeals in nearly 20 years. I have never had a complaint against me filed with the chair or the dean. I would say this is fairly typical among my friends who are professors.

When you made the complaint to the chair you likely burned a bridge with the professor. If a student had filed a complaint like you did against me I would never assist the student again. Not because I was petty, but because the complaint was baseless. I would question your stability. I would question your ability to accurately interpret any of my future actions with you. I would seriously wonder if you were delusional. If the student were to apologize afterward, this would probably make me question the student's stability even more.

>Sometimes the chair just facilitates better communication and the student/professor work out whatever it was and get along fine after that. ( I was an alumni, but same idea, and I had only recently graduated at that point.)

In the end, your whole situation reads as manipulation. Your professor didn't trip over herself to help you or befriend you. Perhaps she already had concerns about you, and therefore wanted to distance herself. (but more likely, you just misinterpreted her tone). You made the complaint to the chair, because you thought the chair would force the professor to talk to you. The chair simply didn't fall for your manipulative plan. He was under no obligation to force the professor to meet with you and that's why you're out to get him. I think the chair did the right thing by involving the dean (and likely the university counsel). He did a terrific job insulating/protecting his faculty from you. I know you see your actions as innocent and benign, but there are some seriously bizarre undertones in your actions that go beyond OCD.

It is obvious that people are seeing something in your behavior that you don't see yourself. The department/university acted appropriately. They didn't harm you. They don't owe you therapy. You owe yourself therapy."
AskProfessors,ff21kex,t1_ff1xy8y,1579491323.0,"It sounds like you were already on the radar of the chair prior to your complaint about the tone of your professor's email, and he acted cautiously. Not his fault. Your prior actions gave him little option. He did the right thing - he brought his dean into the loop, he addressed your complaint, and limited your interaction with his faculty and staff. I'm willing to bet he has contacted those in the department to alert him of any of your attempts to contact members of the department."
AskProfessors,ff20qgt,t1_ff1zf84,1579490714.0,">but at the same time, that doesn't mean that she doesn't resent me or that she'd communicate with me in any form.

AskProfessors,ff1vzc9,t1_ff1rpth,1579487422.0,">I don't see how he could have broken the protocol in such situations because he disliked me. 

No proof that he broke protocol. From the information you provided, it sounds like the chair acted prudently.

If I was chair (and I have been department chair), and I had a particularly difficult student (which I'm saying you are - I don't care if you agree with me), I would defer the issue to my supervisor, the dean.

It doesn't matter what his friend said. You provided the chair's firend with your version of events. I'm guessing you left out all the history prior to the ""tone"" email from your professor.

Until you see that you are responsible for yourself and your actions, you'll never move forward.

You're waiting for everyone to come around to your thinking, but everyone else has moved on - including the chair and the professor. People involved aren't all of a sudden going to start seeing it your way.

Getting therapy (on your own) will help you see that you don't need the whole world to see it your way. That you are responsible for your actions - which is empowering by the way. 

Until then, I think finding peace will be very difficult for you."
AskProfessors,ff15le3,t3_er3fvl,1579475468.0,"Just send the professor a reminder. I usually tell students who request a letter to send me a reminder.

I give myself a week or so to get over the sting. I might still think about the comments during this time, but I don't attempt to work on the article during this time.

After a week or so, I usually conclude that most of the comments were constructive. Once the emotional impact is over, I can usually get re-focused and re-energized.

Unfortunately, rejection is a pretty common part of academia. Have a slice now and again, but keep chugging along."
AskProfessors,fez89jf,t1_fexntgu,1579454729.0,">It's one thing to provide input, but people were starting to tell me that the reason my professor wouldn't except my apology is because I harassed her for months before writing the chair. I hadn't contacted her within the 4 months from the time our class ended to the time I wrote her about the proposal, but they'd rather believe the rumors.

But likewise, you ignore all your other actions in the saga. Your behavior likely had a cumulative effect on the department and informed them on how to make decisions about interacting with you.

>I honestly never meant to dox my professor, ………

But you did, and instead of just leaving after you did so, you doubled down. You kept posting about her so others could deduce who she is. Then you had the whole debacle on AITA where you doxed the professor who assisted you during your housing crisis. 

>(maybe--diet-cokehead-- will post that professor told her that she'll forgive me on the condition that I dox myself. I'd say he/she could share the laugh with their family next year at Thanksgiving or Christmas, except their own family doesn't invite them to holiday gatherings. But I digress.)

I think this statement may say a lot about your everyday personality. When someone does something that you find egregious you will go out of your way to find a way to bring them down.

When the department attempted to assist you with your housing situation, you left the home in two days, which as you said is your prerogative. However, you couldn’t just let it go. Nope. You had to add your horrible opinion of someone’s home to your complaint to the university about its housing policy. 

The professor didn’t behave the way that fed your fixation, so you desperately submitted a proposal for a presentation at a conference. When the professor didn’t jump at the chance to assist you with the research and didn’t answer your email with the promptness and enthusiasm you wanted, you complained to her boss. 

I’m beginning to think these aren’t rare events in your life.

Not that you’ll listen, but this is where therapy could help. If you come to Reddit for therapy, you’re going to have a bad time. 

That’s said, I think a majority of the advice given her is solid. However, it isn’t what you’re ready to hear. Therapy can help you figure out the steps to accept your circumstances. Your OCD isn’t a superpower that is propelling you forward in life.

I'm convinced that the OP’s obsession is self-indulgent. This is exactly where she wants to be and that's why she tries so hard to stay right where she is. She is desperately clinging to any part of this self-construct relationship she can.

She isn’t her for advice. She is here for herself. She doesn’t care about the people she effects. She’s doxed them all, but is only concerned about doxing herself.

The professor isn’t a real person in this relationship. The professor is an object, a possession. The OP really only knows the superficial parts of the professor’s life, but she’s built the entire self-serving infatuation about the professor. You’re right, from the professor’s perspective I’m sure this is absolutely terrifying. 

I’m also convinced that the OP is getting off on the toxicity of this situation. That’s the reason she clings to Reddit. We’ll be getting an update on her update in the future so she can get another bump. My hope is that while the OP is getting her high, the university/department is documenting the shit out of all of this. And maybe that will insulate the professor and the department from further real-life interaction with the OP. My guess is that she’s already been “shadow-banned” from the department."

At the time that the email issues began with the professor, you were no longer a student of hers. You complained to her supervisor about the tone of one of her emails and that she didn’t respond to your second email within 24 hours. Your behavior was likely seen as strange and bizarre. It certainly would be to me if I was in her shoes.

Perhaps she was advised not to communicate with you because of the cumulative behavior you exhibited (turning down housing and employment opportunities). Perhaps your behavior was more on their radars than you care to believe.

Your professor absolutely has the right to feel safe from a student’s strange behavior. Your complaint alone to the chair was strange (you have share the email complaint before). If a student filed a similar complaint against me, I would never want to interact with that student again.

I once had a student harass me after a failed grade appeal. His behavior was aggressive and snowballed into more bizarre actions. I have no doubt he had a mental health issue. 

I eventually received an harassment order against him. The experience changed my life completely. My feeling of safety and trust was forever changed. 

I come to work and do my job. I care about my students but that doesn’t mean that I have subject myself to behaviors I felt threatened my well-being. If you have a mental health issue, it isn’t her problem to make you feel okay about it. It just isn’t in her job description.

The student whom I had the harassment order against more or less left me alone while the order was in place. Soon after the order expired the student came to my office. He stood between me and the door. His intention was to have a friendly conversation with me but I told him straight away to get the hell out of my office. In fact I yelled it so  others could hear me as well.

I assume he felt similar to how you feel now. I’m almost positive that he didn’t understand my actions. Perhaps he thought that a friendly conversation will change the past experience. Nope! 

Unfortunately, until you become a threat to yourself or others, your mental health is your responsibility. It isn’t your professors job to figure out what’s wrong with you, what your true motivations are, or what would make you feel better. She’s not a mental health professional. She has every right to buffer herself against you if you have made her feel uncomfortable with your behavior.

Definitely do. I’m sure the outcome will be different than the 5 other posts you’ve made about your sas saga.

>However, I will say that, no, I did not appreciate the chair filing an official grievance against this professor, the person whom I admired most in my life, over a misunderstanding and thereby getting her to hate/stop speaking to me. What should I have done? Sent him a thank you card?

Ummm, maybe don’t make a complaint to professor's supervisor if they are the person you admire most in life. Your complaint was manipulative. The department chair didn’t fall for your manipulation. You’ve raged against him since. Now it seems that no one in the department wants anything to do with you, including your beloved professor. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."

For example, I might have a cap on how many students I can have in a lab due to safety concerns or amount of equipment I have.

The only way to find out is to contact the instructor."

I also set small writing goals and reward myself when I met those goals. Like my goal is to write for a solid 20 minutes and my reward is to be on Reddit for 2 hours."
