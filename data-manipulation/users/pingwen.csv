cats,fg1m0jw,t3_ew9lu5,1580429513.0,If these were my cats they would have started world war 3 over the heater.
muacjdiscussion,fg1hyh0,t1_fg0qbz2,1580427435.0,The small one is especially tiny. I recommend the supersize for value.
DuggarsSnark,ffwlpu2,t1_ffvpkd3,1580304901.0,Harsh but I lolled.
BeautyGuruChatter,ffrwb1p,t3_eus2d3,1580167318.0,Her excessive collection of makeup she will never use up is way worse for the environment than individual recyclable cardboard wrappings for single shadows.
MakeUpAddictionUK,ffqh5vi,t1_ffq4r4t,1580134465.0,"Thanks for the tip, they have a good range!"
MakeUpAddictionUK,ffqgvok,t1_ffqeyic,1580134230.0,"RIP indeed.

I feel the same way about my silver gel nail polish top coat, though it was around for a few years. Never forget."
MakeUpAddictionUK,ffq4x46,t1_ffq4vki,1580120685.0,Yeah. My wilko is terrible about putting out testers so people just pop stuff open...
MakeUpAddictionUK,ffq4d0r,t1_ffq1x44,1580119779.0,That's bizarre. They're European aren't they? Why does America get better shit than us? I think I remember those. I had a brown one.
MakeUpAddictionUK,ffq4159,t1_ffq0wcq,1580119253.0,Interesting. Off to take a look.
MakeUpAddictionUK,ffq3zvi,t1_ffq0nxf,1580119197.0,"You can do click and collect and pick it up in store, if that helps. My poor wilko never had any stock but my new one has loads of lash princess."
MakeUpAddictionUK,ffp4o2b,t1_ffp4esw,1580086149.0,Uuuugh I know. They discontinued my favourite nail polish top coat - the gel one in the silver bottle. I bought a different one to try instead and it was HORRIBLE. Old one lasted me over a week to two weeks chip free. I had chips within a day with the replacement. I'm so pissed off about it.
cats,ffozt10,t3_eubzc0,1580083745.0,"Beautiful Sneaky. I'm so sorry for your loss. I had a cat from 5 to 26 - she was 20 1/2 when she passed away, so similar to your Sneaky, and it was unbelievably hard. Just like you I couldn't remember a time without her. Anyway, I don't want to make this about me, but just say, it does get easier. You will get through. It's awful and you never stop missing them, but you'll be OK.

Lots of love OP."
Makeup,ffigdjw,t3_etqvpc,1579973230.0,"Honestly, I don't rate highlighter palettes. There's always going to be shades you can't use and they're bulky. I would get single highlighters you love and that work for your skin.

My favourite is Benefit Cookie."
muacjdiscussion,ffde5w1,t3_esx2li,1579818985.0,Nabla has some beautiful packaging on their palettes! I have Dreamy and Dreamy 2 and they're lovely. Nice mirrors too.
PanPorn,ff9yoig,t1_ff9nk0t,1579724344.0,"People will just start dumping their half used eyeshadow out with a spatula, which I'm not sure is the intended point."
Minecraft,ff6t9a8,t3_eruzyr,1579634415.0,It's nice to see a cake without fondant! Nice work.
cats,fetfzfj,t3_eqi78i,1579375106.0,This cat reminds me of Jiji from Kiki's Delivery Service.
FundieSnark,fertmtg,t1_fer0z92,1579358255.0,"And glorifying Satan, probably."
zpaletteporn,feqvzfu,t3_eqbkx6,1579346731.0,This is so beautiful!
Awwducational,feg705g,t1_fefmkak,1579079966.0,"No. There's a process called X silencing which minimises effects of extra chromosomes in cells, only expressing one at a time. Some XY disorders in humans cause mild retardation but not to the extent of other trisomies."
Awwducational,feexbnb,t1_feerky6,1579043249.0,White is on another chromosome. The X chromosome either has red or black. So the only way a male cat can be calico is if he has an abnormal chromosome number.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fee9ja7,t1_fee9ehe,1579029192.0,"It's the name of a bird, also pronounced ree uh, and one of those bit me once, so I'm doubly biased against the stupidity of this name."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fee87q7,t3_eokc8l,1579028410.0,"If it's pronounced Ray, spell it Ray."
muacjdiscussion,fdr8ri0,t1_fdqx5z8,1578681094.0,"I see them as twins, but one is more popular. They have a lot of the same products in different packaging."
