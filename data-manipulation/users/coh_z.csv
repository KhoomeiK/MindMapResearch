AskMen,ffwpnvp,t3_evay0q,1580307941.0,Idk why other women do it. Maybe because of lack of trust. To be honest i m not even that interested to snoop at my bf phone. He also doesn't do that to my phone. But i also don't have any problem if he want to look at my phone. I guess when u trust each other this kind of thing doesn't really matter.
