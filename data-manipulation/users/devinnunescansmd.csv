confession,ffak6ai,t3_eskn9w,1579737763.0,Don't be ashamed. You have nothing to be ashamed about. You made a difficult decision which is a very adult thing to do. You do not have an obligation to tell anyone else. I'm sure you didn't make this decision for no reason so have faith in yourself and your judgement. Remember that hormone fluctuations can cause all sorts of feelings and it will be easier to look at the situation when you have more distance from it. I hope you find some peace.

AskReddit,ff782jo,t3_es1btu,1579642958.0,"My stepdad blamed me when my sister tried to kill herself. I had already left home at that point (my sister was still at home). Oh and after that they kicked her out with a broken collarbone in the mountains in the winter. They're also racists and huge sexists. Haven't spoken to either of them in 2 years or so and I've never been happier. (My sister is doing better now, she's in a much better home)."
