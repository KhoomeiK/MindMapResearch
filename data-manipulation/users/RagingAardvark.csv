aww,ffh59xw,t1_ffh2it9,1579923494.0,Your baby is going to be so loved-- is already so loved-- and that's the most important part. Hope you have a smooth pregnancy and delivery!
AskReddit,ffh2wjx,t1_fffsbj0,1579921652.0,"I love his little speech prior to escaping: ""Well it's just that you seem to be labouring under the delusion that I am going to -- come quietly. I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all, Cornelius. I have absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban. I could break out, of course -- but what a waste of time, and frankly, I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing."""
aww,ffh2evd,t1_ffh23fp,1579921279.0,"You're both gonna be fine. There are good days and bad days, and sweet moments like this that make the bad days just sort of.... dissolve."
C25K,ffh22sd,t1_ffgxodh,1579921024.0,"Took me a while, too. I was so proud when I broke 30, then 29. The past two years, I got more serious about running, read more about training plans etc. and started knocking off more time, but it's been a long journey, for sure! First 5k was back in 2003!"

AskReddit,ffgpkhp,t1_fffgrqh,1579911819.0,"My dog also gets the zoomies after a poop, although less so now that he's older and has some arthritis."
AskReddit,ffgphiu,t1_fffas05,1579911761.0,"We taught our dogs to play hide and seek. It's tons of fun, but they get really rambunctious so we have to be careful about who and what is around when we do it. I wouldn't initiate it if I had just set a wine glass on the coffee table, for instance. But they get such a kick out of it, it's good ""enrichment"" for them."
