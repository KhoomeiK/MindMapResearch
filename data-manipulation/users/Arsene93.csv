mendrawingwomen,ff3yp9u,t3_erixby,1579551753.0,"Lady Mariah is a boss in the DLC of bloodborne. She's the strongest (and possibly one of the first) apprentice of the first Hunter Gehrman.

Lady Mariah is a very respected char in the soulsborne community for her elegant battle style, her cool design and the lore surrounding her boss battle.

Without spoiling too much, Mariah gets disgusted by her fellow hunters after a certain hunt. She swears never to hunt again and is dedicated to protecting a certain creature from ever being hurt again by guarding the clocktower.

So she guards the astral clocktower whatever the cost. The more you injure her the more desperate she becomes and the more powerful her attacks, using powers she long ago swore never to use. Willing to do whatever it takes to make sure nobody will ever use the clocktower again.


Developers Fromsoft have a knack for writing strong and interesting female characters but I truly believe that lady Mariah is one of their best."

I mean she had lost the ring for a big chunk of the story and Kvhote never acted any different with her when it was gone. Wouldn't the absence of the ring undo whatever glamour was in Kvhote?

I just think she keeps fidgeting with those rings to try to read the story knots. That's why she was studying yllish in the second book."

KingkillerChronicle,feozct3,t1_feoysl4,1579308680.0,"It think it's mostly a feeling but if I had to name it I think it's that Kvhote almost seems dumber around her, if that make sense?

Sim and Fela kinda mention this in book 2 where they call Kvhote dumb and mute for not realizing his feelings for her. 

Oh and I personally don't like it how she constantly runs off. I get why she does it but for example in the first book she leaves Kvhote after he faced down that Draccus.
Doesn't (as far as I remember) look for him or checks up if he even survived. That kinda rubbed me the wrong way.


Finally I'm not saying I hate her. That moment when she gave Kvhote the lutecase was really heartfelt and sweet and is easily one of my fav moments in the books."

A cool little indie game that you can finish in like 4-5 hours. I don't want to say too much out of fear of spoiling the game but it has a unique story that feeds into the gameplay. The story/gameplay makes you play the game again for at least a second time and at most 3-4, more times because the way you played the first time effects what happens the second and subsequent times."

I don't think Putin would want that since that would make him a huge target. So maybe he'll do more stuff like provide guns, Intel, mercenaries to help Iran.

On the other hand, Iran is in a strategically important position for Russia. If the US wins and installs a puppet government like in the 50's then Russia is surrounded by enemies. So it's possible that out of desperation that they will choose to openly support Iran with soldiers.
