“No thank you” is fine. 

“How did you get my number? Please remove me from your mailing list” is also fine. 

And just… not replying is good. You’re under no obligation to (I presume? Not sure where you are) so you could just block him."
AmItheAsshole,feyd4tn,t3_eqpkz1,1579443990.0,"Totally NTA. And I’m so sorry for your loss. You gave everyone a chance to say goodbye and it was the kindest thing to do for your cat. 

Your wife is probably struggling with the loss of her friend and in the denial/anger stage of grief - I wonder how much of that is truly directed at you. 

I hope you’re doing ok and can work things out soon."
AmItheAsshole,fexl61y,t3_eqtevd,1579432795.0,"NAH. She was 13 when she outed you and it sounds like your parents and their religion probably did a number on you both. But equally you’ve been through a hell of a lot and you’re not obliged to forgive her if you don’t feel you can.

It might be worth considering meeting her to discuss what happened now that you’re both adults. It’s not your job to educate her but you might find that - forgiveness or not - you get some closure from talking to her about what happened and how it has affected you. 

Whatever you decide, take care of yourself.

Edit to clarify: Obviously the parents are assholes but this judgement isn’t about them."

relationships,fdxy81k,t3_ena2pl,1578774139.0,"Woah! Do NOT cut your hair. That is an insane request from any bride, but particularly when she knows how much you prize your hair. If she wants you to have hair that looks a certain way in her pictures then offer to get a stylist to create an up do that will achieve this. Or worst case, a wig (although that might be uncomfortable over long hair). 

I don’t know if she has some sort of other problem with you or if she is just going nuts about the wedding but this is not ok. Maybe remind her that - as a woman - your body is not just there to be looked at by others, actually, and that nobody should be able to tell you what to do with it. That includes her and her really quite horrible request for you to cut a bit of yourself off. 

Hope she comes to her senses soon, but whether you’re in or out of the wedding, keep your hair the way YOU want it."
relationships,fdmk8ng,t3_eliut4,1578553008.0,"Talk to her like loves you and has your best interests at heart. You’re a dad now, so I hope you can start putting yourself in her shoes…

If your barely-18 year old daughter started dating someone YOUR age and got pregnant 6 months into the relationship, how do you think you would feel/worry/react?

There’s a lot going on here and a lot of red flags. Please take care of yourself in this relationship. Hope you figure things out with your mum."
AmItheAsshole,fc544wm,t3_eg6wjw,1577442179.0,"NTA. He sounds like male privilege personified. He’s not said anything about the type of girl he’s looking for or given you any indication that one of your friends might actually be a great match. No, he’s just “sexually frustrated” and wants to meet some (much younger) women in a way that is convenient for him. 

He needs to learn that women are not there solely for his sexual gratification and if you say they’re not interested, that should be enough. Gross, entitled and not a little creepy."

needadvice,fc3bhhg,t3_ef8tum,1577386103.0,"Hi there. Sorry to hear you’re feeling this way. Obviously I can only go by what you’ve posted, but to me this sounds like another phase of your depression. You care enough to ask for help, and you know you’re actions aren’t healthy - that in itself is positive. And that numb feeling doesn’t necessarily mean you no longer have the capacity for empathy but could well be emotional exhaustion - so unless you are starting to hurt animals or set fires, which really are warning flags, you certainly are describing how I feel and act when I am at my most depressed. 

Advice wise, I’m not sure of your age/gender/circumstances but if you are able to go to a therapist or GP/doctor to discuss how you’re feeling they might be able to help. You might find that they recommend some medication or stopping/changing the medication you’re on. If you’re a woman on birth control medication, this can also sometimes have a severe/fluctuating impact on your mental health, even if you haven’t changed your prescription and a change/rest can be beneficial. 

Aside from that, I assume/hope if you’ve been severely depressed for years that you are aware of some of the other things that you can do to help yourself: the right foods, exercising regularly, volunteering etc. 

No quick fixes, I’m afraid, and I really am sorry you’re going though this (and going through it alone by the sound of it). I do think talking to a professional is probably a good way forward and in the meantime don’t be too hard on yourself. It sounds like you’ve had a rough few years and I hope things improve. Sending hugs."
AmItheAsshole,fbgxevt,t3_ed9cyv,1576860778.0,"YTA. You come home every second weekend on average but are glad to do it so your family is comfortable? Your contribution to the family seems to be purely financial and it feels from your tone as though your wife and children only exist for you to admire when you do occasionally pop home.

Something to help your wife with the housework is the most transactional and uncaring gift you could have bought. Next time, make your Christmas gift that you’re taking some time off work or a family holiday."
