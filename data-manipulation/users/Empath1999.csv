Hunter

Most of the trails seem open, surprisingly it is packed but not too packed. It’s normal hunter packed. Maybe even less

The snow conditions are mixed. 

The Cliff is icy as shit. Crazy Steepness+icy=be careful

Hellgate has really good coverage, by far my fav of the day

Drop off is icy as hell also

Belt parkway has good snow coverage, dust over crust

Of black diamonds: Alconquin had quite a bit of ice patches in the afternoon and tuscarora had tons of ice chunks.

Weather: In the morning it was cold, it began snowing in the aftermoon.

The bottom part of “why not“ is shut for a race, there is a tiny trail to wintuk. However, the snow conditions on wintuk sucks with quite a few areas missing snow altogether.

There’s not really any black diamonds today worth doing here, a number of them are closed. Gonna end up doing the blue black trails.
