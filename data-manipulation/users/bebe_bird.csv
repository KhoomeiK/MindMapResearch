AskReddit,ffik9nx,t1_ffhylen,1579975883.0,"When my brother was about 8, his friend tried a wrestling move on him on the trampoline. It dislocated his neck. Luckily, it did not severe his spine. Miraculously, they were able to realign his spine at the hospital without doing additional damage (which was a very real possibility.) He was in the hospital for a couple days and had to wear a neck brace for weeks. Not allowed to play any contact sports like football after that.

My parents sued the parents (or maybe not sued, but pressed the insurance company into paying) for damages, who were not watching the boys out on the trampoline. But to try to maintain good will between parties, they only took the money the insurance company paid, nothing from the parents themselves. Still, it was about $50k, which went into a trust fund for my brother for when he was older (college, downpayment, etc). So, it all ended well, but he could have been paralyzed."
AskReddit,ffij0xa,t1_ffh3m9t,1579975032.0,"We just need to expand our vocabulary beyond ""strong"" and ""weak"". Even the way we talk abou this sounds like we're talking about physical attributes, which compounds the problem I think. Being open, honest, and vulnerable emotionally have nothing to do with physical strength, which is something a lot of men take pride in. Maybe the more we can draw that line in the sand, the more we can promote understanding.

Just a thought :-)"
AskReddit,ffgtewm,t1_ffgguqi,1579914593.0,"I completely agree with the ""dodged a bullet"" comment.

My husband manages depression and was abusing alcohol because of it. At his worst, he was voluntarily committed to an in-patient mental hospital. This was before we were married, but we were engaged. You bet I was already thinking of wedding vows ""in sickness and in health"". A good partner is there for you regardless. 

I honestly think part of this is the social stigma against mental health problems too. But guys probably have more pressure to be ""normal"" and so this social stigma comes down even harder on them. Mental health is still health. Treat it like any other medical condition!"
AskReddit,ffgsf2o,t1_ffgpu85,1579913863.0,I think he was saying that opening yourself up to others is making yourself vulnerable. The fact that you can let someone see that vulnerability in you takes a lot of emotional strength.
AskReddit,ffgs5gz,t1_ffgqdi6,1579913674.0,"Start looking for another job, and dont leave til you have it in hand. Then you can leave for a reason: better workplace culture.

Also, being different shouldn't be a handicap. A room full of people with exactly the same thoughts/background won't be able to ""think outside the box"" to solve problems or come up with new ideas. Their behavior damages you, but it also damages the company, because they're limiting themselves to that tiny sliver of perspective. They're missing out because if you suggest something they've never thought of, they'll dismiss it out of hand cause ""we've always done it this way"" instead of embracing new ideas. Its advantageous to have a diverse workforce, and to not tolerate diversity in all its forms means they're in a downward slide.

You can do better! Just make your move slowly, line something up first, then quit. Who cares what those assholes think anyway?"

I will never shame a guy for any ""feminine"" qualities. As a female engineer, I understand the complete BS of gender roles in certain activities or aspects of life. I have a womb. You've got a penis. That's the main difference, and its strictly biological. Our minds, emotions, and actions should be held in the same light as one another.

I really wish society would catch up."

TwoXChromosomes,fdwjqwe,t1_fdulp4z,1578759474.0,"Sure, economic growth does have a lot to do with a growing workforce, but there's also tons of ways we're becoming more efficient at making things, such as computers, technology, automation, and robots. People fear ""robots taking their job"", and generally as technology increases the humans required to produce the same amount drops. So although I agree with this statement generally, I have high hopes that in the future, a growing economy will not be linked to a growing workforce."
todayilearned,fdqefkw,t1_fdq0aus,1578664521.0,"I work with a lot of Germans but also have a lot of good friends in Germany. My German colleagues, especially the one who lives/works here on contract for 3-4 years, has excellent English but does not know slang. Because I have a lot of German friends, know some German, etc, I'm comfortable enough to correct or comment on his phrases that are just a little ""off"" (i.e. ""I took the freedom"" instead of ""I took the liberty"", answering why the front seat of the car is called ""shotgun"" etc)

Story time: he's always been very positive in feedback on my work performance as well as my colleague on the same project who reports to him. One day, while telling me we were both doing a good job, he called me and my colleague ""bimbos"", as in ""I'm not sure everyone expects such good work out of two young, well, bimbos, but you guys are handling the project excellently"". It was kind of in passing, and I'm still kicking myself for not correcting him on how insulting ""bimbo"" is (an attractive but unintelligent woman), whereas when I talked to my German friends, they said ""bimbo"" was still an insulting term, but typically used to describe an intern who has to do all the ""dirty work"". (My colleague and I are both relatively new to the company and don't shy away from the down and dirty to get things done)

I guess my point is, even if their English seems perfect, its still possible for misunderstandings, and no one is going to get upset if you clarify phrases!"
LifeProTips,fcs7xqp,t1_fcrzml0,1577912700.0,"I definitely think the ""I'll be back on X day to help with chores"" (or ""what day is good for me to come help with chores"") is fantastic advice. It not only gives them the opportunity to get help with little things they might not be handling very well, but gives a social connection where there is opportunity to talk, but no requirement if they can't/don't want to at that moment."
mildlyinteresting,fcne556,t1_fcnaa51,1577809820.0,"Hello! I'm a chemical engineer who has helped publish 2 book chapters!

You absolutely need to have the rights to any images you put in the book, but if something is stated it's free to reproduce it would be okay. Usually those statements are for non-commercial purposes though, which a text book is not. In my own text book chapters, we stuck to images we made ourselves because it's often difficult to get the rights to images that aren't your own.

However, when writing a chapter, I've definitely seen people put in little gems like this, or intentionally funny wording. Many times, it's a grad student (ages 22-30) who is writing that first draft that is then edited by someone more senior (professor/research advisor). 

Edit: then of course it goes through the publisher themselves, but they are often looking at grammar, layout, permissions, etc, and not content, so I've seen some interesting wording slip by and get published."
