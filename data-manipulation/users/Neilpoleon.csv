Also once you are in the federal government it is easier to hop around to other roles in the government.

In addition to pay, you will get great retirement and health benefits.

Also once you have completed one year in federal government, it is near impossible to fire you. You won't get this kind of job security anywhere else.

Another benefit is that government doesn't have an up or out culture. This means if you want to stay in that position and never have to manage people then you can. Obviously, you then won't make pay raises other than the step increases. However, the pay of your level is still very substantial especially if you live in a lower cost of living area. 

Later, if you want more money you can easily get hired by some defense contractor company. However, I will warn your work life balance will not be as great."

Town hall now is more a slang term used for a corporate gathering where the whole company gets together to discuss something. It is also used for an event where a politician goes to a community and fields questions from voters."
MaliciousCompliance,fes8wd2,t3_eqfee8,1579362660.0,"First off, great story. I am curious does she own this company/store? I notice so many people who have extra money to throw around decide to open a store or restaurant when they clearly don't have the skills required. Amy's Baking Company on Kitchen Nightmares is a perfect example of this.

As someone who has been in the workforce a few years longer and also been in toxic environments like this one I have some advice for you. Feel free to take it or leave. Apologies if any of this sounds patronizing.

Only put in the extra effort in an environment where you are actually valued. It was sweet of you to try to improve her business but clearly she did not actually want the help. It would have been better to save your energy.

Also it is amazing how much changing your employer can improve your mental health. I just left a company I have worked a few years with and find myself much happier now that I have left.

Don't accept something when you deserve better. Just like a bad relationship, people are sometimes afraid to leave a job (myself included) since they don't think anything else out there is better. Just because one employer is bad doesn't mean that their behavior is the norm.

Best of luck to you in finishing university!"
