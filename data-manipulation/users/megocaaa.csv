relationship_advice,ffievdy,t1_ffi3vl7,1579972202.0,"Yeah you are right thank you... I think I just panicked.. and mostly my friends and family do think it’s a strange relationship and wish I would find something here at home, even though he switched careers and is earning the certifications before coming to be with me, because he could not find a job with his old degree here. Even though he more or less has paid child support in lieu of their deadbeat father. Paying daycare bills, making Christmas happen etc.

Last night, I went full crazy girlfriend. I stalked his social media and every Reddit post, I sent receipts, and was convinced he was some malevolent liar due to him liking three photos of female friends and posts he had made on Reddit three years ago.

He got 78 notifications from me (he’s exhausted in his new program for work and keeps strange hours to talk to me and his phone goes on silent at night). Those notifications were probably sixty five texts and the rest calls. Accusing him of wild things, making a real case for myself that I’m a creepy stalker, and even some name calling. I woke up to him holding his tongue, empathizing, promising me everything will work out like its supposed to, and apologizing, and telling me how dedicated, and in love with me he is. There’s been times just one long texts about my feelings sent a guy running. The only thing he worried about was me. 

It is a strange situation, and I do have my insecurities. I’ve gained weight w the stress of court and it’s not come off yet, I’m turning 29 this year.. and I’ve been systematically abused by a narcissist. Koen feels like a dream so absurd you can’t believe it. 

Thank you for listening"

I’m a single parent. It was nonstop talking. We live in a small apartment and I never not hear them. Today I got home, was trying to clean and my oldest had a question and I was like dude, you need to give me five minutes when I get home to not be asked questions. It’s unfair to me when you don’t. Stopped it for a minute but it will be a hard habit to break for sure. Even now they are in the bath giggling and talking and I’m trying to relax for a minute and while sometimes it’s so cute sometimes I just want QUIET. It’s so hard to bite my tongue.

A) continue being too embarrassed to talk about it and eventually resent him due to the sexual frustration and sabotaging the potential great relationship you could have B) tell him, he does nothing, you realize he doesn’t really care about your needs that much and isn’t that great and therefore isn’t a viable life partner, saving yourself a lot of trouble and heartache C) you tell him and he cares and you keep the guy and get the orgasms.

To me I assumed these people were just inexperienced but he has plenty of IRL friends and opportunity, all of it was just his choice. I love that there’s never been once that I didn’t trust him. Even when out with friends at bars or restaurants or little trips. But he also loves gaming and for him it’s a way to hang out with his friends too. He doesn’t game while I’m around and is always game for my silly indoor or outdoor plans, he’s Dutch and bikes frequently too. 

My ex was an “experienced” guy who loved parties and smoking and alcohol. I love that we can enjoy a simple movie, walk, etc. My kids can watch their stepdad enjoy a single cider and put it down, or nothing at all. 

And he said that he was waiting for the right person. I was lucky enough for that to be me. I love that every time I take off my clothes I blow his mind. I genuinely feel like the sexiest woman in the world, when I am with him, through his eyes. It’s innocent and pure and dirty at the same time. Its perfect, and after the things I’ve been through, getting loved the way he does and by someone like him is the light at the end of a very shitty tunnel."

I’ve helped an ex boyfriend do this.. because it was very emotional and I cared about him as a person.. It may not have been so much about the picture.. women tend to put up with shit until there’s a straw there’s a straw that broke the camels back and sometimes you’re pretty fed up and something small and seemingly bizarre can do it.. she might not be so upset that you found her hot at 15, but that you’re ignoring her literally, neglecting her emotionally, and leaving all this work up to her.
