The deal the wife made was to save the husband, the tragedy that took her life initially took his but in the final moments she made a deal with a devil for her soul to spare him and take her, rewriting the tragedy in his mind so hes unawares. She is in Hell and unwilling to return because it would mean her husband would take her place in Hell under her contract. 

The PCs now how to find a way to free her from the contract if they wish to reunite the family."

You could try convincing the mods but I doubt it's worth the hassle of managing 2 subreddits. Personally I think post flair is a good option so we can filter out politics if wed like too.

TheRightCantMeme,fenthgf,t1_fenf33g,1579290591.0,"Fuck, you just reminded me of my libertarian Econ professor. He insisted cars used to be safer because steel was sturdy. He showed us pictures of old car crashes where the cars had some dings in them and thats it. Said Gov regulations made cars less safe as companies had to follow the law instead of innovate. He used pics of crumpled cars, and the number of accident related deaths by year as evidence.

I tried explaining crumple zones, and how deaths by year doesnt show the whole story you need to account for increased number of drivers. He said if I could prove they were safer Id get extra credit. So my dumbass put together a report using number of cars on road vs road deaths, as well as average road speeds across the years to show that not only did old cars result in death more often, they also did so at much lower speeds.

He tossed the report away and said because I used .gov websites the data was skewed in favor of regulations and to avoid bias if I want to prove a point... fuck him."

florida,femzlcp,t1_femx2r0,1579273614.0,Felon does not equal scumbag. Many people are felons simply because they couldnt afford a lawyer and the state appointed one pushed them into a plea deal to minimize prison time and their own workload. Its a shitty system that victimizes people and then even after they have supposedly 're-entered society' prevents them from being a regular citizen.
