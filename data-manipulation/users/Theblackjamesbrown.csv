It's very likely an incomplete account, and dark matter's role is to bridge the gap in the science.

The 'evidence' of which you speak, is only evidence of dark matter in so far as that the existence of dark matter is sufficient to explain these observable phenomena *given that the rest of our current cosmological model is correct*. 

If, however, there are prior errors, now built into that model and taken as gospel, then it might well be that model would fail to align with further observation, thus requiring the postulation of some other variables to account for the anomolies - dark matter, dark energy, perhaps additional mysterious entities in the future when, again, observation proves to be problematic for precious scientific dogma. This is in no way *proof* that these entities exist - not so long as the possibility remains that the model itself is incorrect.

Further, many make the mistake of thinking that our scientific theories serve to reveal objective truths of the universe to us. Rather, human science is, I believe, merely instrumental to us as epistemically limited beings - it gives us a *subjective* explanation of phenomena as we observe them. We're only explaining phenomena as best we can to ourselves, as we ourselves observe them. I sincerely doubt we can ever hope to go any further than this."

philosophy,fdkfnqb,t1_fdjwfco,1578502864.0,"So much this. Ultimately, theories of fundamental physics, cosmology, the nature of the fundamental universe are in the realm of metaphysics; they outrun what can be tested empirically. Philosophy is NOT science. Philosophy rushes in where science is incapable of treading. Philosophy differs from science in that it's theories are frequently unfalsifiable. That might be interpreted as a weakness but this is also it's strength; philosophy isn't limited by empirical considerations in the way that science is. Philosophers can play fast and loose with the rules of the scientific method and, in the process, stake out new territory into which science might enquire."
