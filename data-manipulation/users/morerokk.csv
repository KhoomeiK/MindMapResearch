paydaytheheist,ffftah4,t1_fffrv2p,1579891326.0,"> The refresh rate isn't bad, though.

It is, 80hz is a noticeable downgrade. I have extensively used both and I can say that the Rift is far superior.

The tracking is noticeably worse on the Rift S too, I had way too much jitter when literally just standing still and looking around.

> No physical adjustable IPD isn't a issue if you're in the average sweet spot.

Cool, I guess everyone who doesn't fit the predefined IPD can get fucked then.

On a related note, the headphones on the Rift S were surprising, but they were also terrible in comparison to the Rift's.

> Quest isn't horribly underpowered.

They literally had to strip out major level geometry and nearly all the particles in Robo Recall, and Robo Recall is one of the lightest VR games I can think of. They literally had to make the glass windows entirely opaque (rather than transparent), because mobile GPU's cannot feasibly draw to the same pixel twice.

A month ago I read an article saying ""Oh yeah, there's also tonemapping to improve the lighting, *but that's not viable for VR*"". It's literally a 20 year old technology and has been used by the likes of Monolith in *2002*, the Quest just can't handle it.

The Quest has given both the masses and uninformed developers the idea that VR is either in its infancy or just a gimmick. And because of its popularity, developers will not be making any more *real* VR games like PAYDAY 2 or Skyrim because their glorified cellphone can't run it.

When you can't even properly run VRChat with more than 6 people in one instance, how would the Quest ever *hope* to compete with *real* VR?

> Plus, the Link cable, while requiring a very heavy PC, is also great because its the best of both worlds.

At that point it's a worse PC headset, because not only does the linking have some issues, the refresh rate is also capped at an even lower 72hz. The only thing it accomplishes is make people say ""damn, I wish I bought an Index instead"".

If you really want wireless, the Vive Pro is also finally the price it should have been from the start."
paydaytheheist,fffrmoz,t1_ffdgi7g,1579890299.0,"> What do you mean the Rift S ""isn't worth it""?

Bad refresh rate, meh resolution, *no physical adjustable IPD*, same tracking as WMR (overall quality is worse IMO), and still expensive. It's hard to call the Rift S better than WMR by any margin. A lot of WMR headsets have better resolutions and a higher FOV. The controllers are also better for most non-social games, as the touchpad adds far more to most games than the finger and thumb sensors Oculus has.

Quest is a ridiculously underpowered headset when run standalone, pretty much all it can run is Beat Saber. You can link it to the PC but then you just have a worse PC headset.

The Rift was so far ahead of both the Rift S and the Quest, it's not even funny. Cheaper too."

Pitbulls were bred over several generations to be fighting dogs, whether it be mercilessly murdering cattle or murdering other dogs. That is not even *remotely* comparable to the different races among humans.

Dog breeds are the result of generations of intensive artificial selection by human beings. We, as humans, have specifically chosen what kinds of appearances and behaviors we want to see in specific breeds of dogs. There is a reason why a Border Collie will naturally start herding ducklings or playing children, even if it was never taught to herd. It is for the same reason that pit bull type dogs have a natural inclination towards fighting: we have bred in instinctual behavior in dogs on a genetic level.

If ""black people"" is your first thought when someone mentions fighting dogs, then you may want to take a long fucking look at yourself."

This may have been true one hundred twenty-five years ago. However, in the last thirty years, backyard breeders have haphazardly been breeding these creatures without proper care for temperament or other human positive traits. Dogs that displayed erratic and human aggressive behavior were not culled, as they should have been. In fact, many backyard breeders have specifically selecting human aggressive pits. Today, most of the pit bull type dogs that you see are not remnant of the true well-bred game dogs of old, but backyard breeders, complete with a sketchy genetic lineage."
