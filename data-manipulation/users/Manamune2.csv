todayilearned,ff15ul0,t1_ff14xvm,1579475548.0,No but I’ll start working soon :)
todayilearned,ff0xep8,t1_ff0wuzy,1579473240.0,I doubt that the contract said the employer is entitled to anything done while in the building.
todayilearned,ff0x5d6,t1_ff0v0r7,1579473145.0,No? He didn’t invent whatever he invented for the employer.
todayilearned,ff0sv66,t1_ff0s2by,1579471990.0,That’s not how laws work.
ShitAmericansSay,fezd7hq,t1_fezaumf,1579456119.0,They’re small and you can’t pay over a certain amount (just under 700€) per year though.
ShitAmericansSay,fez665k,t1_feyk6zc,1579454184.0,There are hospital bills in Finland.
MapPorn,fesico1,t1_feqzjwv,1579365468.0,Tons of Flemish people vote for Flemish nationalists.
todayilearned,femqnum,t1_felfpq6,1579266783.0,"I find it funny how people, at least in the West, tend to imagine heaven as something in the clouds/sky, and hell deep underground. In my mind it’s always been just two places side by side in some kind of dark limbo."
cscareerquestionsEU,femqbec,t1_fempxou,1579266473.0,"Company is rather small, about 30-40 employees in this location IIRC (which is the HQ). During the interview they mentioned the possibility of moving onto other roles such as test automation, which would require programming. In any case, your last advice is probably a good idea."
cscareerquestionsEU,feml5u7,t1_femj20u,1579260995.0,What about the networking opportunities though?
cscareerquestionsEU,felegka,t1_feldvpa,1579220258.0,Thank you for your testimonial. That definitely makes me feel better about it!
cscareerquestionsEU,fejx8vy,t1_fejut1u,1579187939.0,The company does IoT and mesh networking stuff. I suppose it's specialised enough that there should be enough other options to choose from.
cscareerquestionsEU,fejvl5f,t1_fejtv2p,1579186861.0,"According to vero's calculator, tax rate for that pay would be 0%. That doesn't include a pension insurance contribution of 7.15% and an unemployment insurance contribution of 1.25% which will be collected from my pay."
cscareerquestionsEU,fejtnd6,t1_fejmfg3,1579185575.0,I have no idea how it makes sense.
cscareerquestionsEU,fejs18w,t1_fejrjx8,1579184426.0,Before. I haven’t checked yet but I doubt there will be much taxes for such a small yearly amount.
cscareerquestionsEU,fejlluh,t1_fejhc45,1579179040.0,Non-competition agreements are regulated by laws though.
cscareerquestionsEU,fejfzgn,t1_fejfj30,1579172411.0,"I looked up the law and I spoke to a lawyer, it’s entirely legal. I’m still on the fence about it so I asked the company for clarifications, as in what they mean by competitor and if the clause is necessary for a student role."
cscareerquestionsEU,fejfxal,t1_fejcw6v,1579172322.0,Why would it be in the law if it was unenforceable?
cscareerquestionsEU,fejc21o,t1_fei27jz,1579166480.0,One issue I have with this offer is that the contract has a clause that says I can't work with a direct or indirect competitor to the company 6 months after my employment ends. Do you know if this is common in Finland? My boyfriend is suggesting to say no to the offer just because of this.
cscareerquestionsEU,fehuhtt,t1_fehtgq7,1579124118.0,Thank you. I thought as much.
leagueoflegends,fehnldf,t1_fe8zr01,1579120179.0,I see now. I haven't used that method in ages.

That argument is moot since a government can do whatever you habilitate it to."
todayilearned,fch9uih,t1_fcgmhbn,1577648566.0,I should think you have the wrong lens. Do you think slavery should have been abolished: yes/no?
todayilearned,fcgjptr,t1_fcgfl5o,1577640912.0,How else would you fix the slavery problem then?
todayilearned,fcgesrb,t1_fcgek7b,1577639259.0,"You can’t promote a dog to a human, but you can promote a slave to either a citizen or an entity that enjoys the same rights as a citizen. Your babbling about equality is irrelevant."
todayilearned,fcge82h,t1_fcgdzyr,1577639076.0,"You don’t become a slave willingly, so how is that a fair application of the law (or lack thereof)?"
todayilearned,fceqf1y,t1_fcdeeu7,1577622861.0,"The financial well being of SLAVE OWNERS? Yeah, a moral government should absolutely not care about that, at least not to a significant extant."
todayilearned,fcepzdu,t1_fcda360,1577622751.0,"That’s straight up wrong. A government is responsible for any individual on their soil, citizen or not."

todayilearned,fbz6zh9,t1_fbz2onu,1577237025.0,Finland ranks better than the US when it comes to doing business despite having significantly stronger labour laws. It seems that you just don’t know how capitalism works.
leagueoflegends,fak1d9u,t1_faictj1,1576159017.0,That's not what the video says though. You get the reset if crescent strike itself kills the target. I haven't tested what you're suggesting though.
