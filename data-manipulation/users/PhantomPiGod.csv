I think that Titans were up there with the best updates of 2019. They encouraged people to stop using tanks, such as TFalc and Fenrir, or anything that relied on damage resistance. Therefore, matches were much more focused on head to head battling instead of six bots shooting a falcon. They also can be used as a last resort, an assault tank or pretty much anything. Brawler, tanker, everything except from beacon runner. Also, All three titans are powerful in their own categories; Kid for the close up brawling, Arthur for tanking and Ming for support. These three are balanced well, so i applaud Pixo for not making a useless titan and giving it for free to lvl 30s."
