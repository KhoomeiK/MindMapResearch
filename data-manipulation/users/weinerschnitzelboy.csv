In regards to 50% brightness looking dim, it is because of how Android handles the screen brightness slider. Android 9 Pie introduced a logarithmic scale for the slider meaning the intensity is visually more linear (50% looks half as bright as 100%) whereas before, like the first half of the bar changes brightness more noticably than the later half.

It has adjustable everything and is an actual reputable company in the office furniture space so you can get replacement parts in the case something breaks.

Basic LCD tech hasn't really changed much in over a decade, especially at the large sizes of TV's. We've just refined the process to make them to a point that the panels are basically flying off the production line. Samsung, LG, and TCL are really the only major companies that actually produce the panels they include into their TV's. Other companies like Sony spec a panel from those and buy it, or buy the ones they reject.

Something as simple as downloading a file was unnecessarily complex due to how Samsung configured their browser and ""open with"" window.

apple,fcpaoh3,t1_fcjmc0b,1577856361.0,"No. Apple is the reason why there is no 1 space grey. Apple’s designers specify a color to the company and the company comes up with a few samples that match their description. If it wasn’t what they wanted, then Apple should deny the sample supplied (and it seems like this article shows them doing just that for the midnight green). Once the color is chosen, the recipe for it is locked in, and they produce it. If Apple wants that same color, all they have to do is tell the company to use the exact recipe they had last time. If the color drifts during production, it is part the producer to QC the dye before sending it to Apple, and part Apple’s responsibility to catch it before it gets out the door.

If there are different space grays, either their designers don’t care about the color(which I highly doubt) or they specified different grays because their tastes changed over time."

It's launch title, Zelda: BoTW is an excellent open world game that relies on style to overcome the lack of hardware power and on top of that, is just an excellent open world exploration game. It's also receiving ports to other games too. Games you can already get on PC, Xbox 360, or PS3, but you just can't take those things with you to some place like the DMV. 

And then there's the shared experiences. Mario Kart is an excellent racing game. I don't even think there's anything comparable. Sure, Forza and the likes have better graphics and simulation, but none are nearly as fun as the frantic feeling of trying to dodge green and block red shells. Oh, and the Switch comes with two controllers right out of the box. Not two full controllers, but each half of a joycon pair is enough for a lot of multiplayer games without having to go out and grab another controller you might just use for that one party game."
