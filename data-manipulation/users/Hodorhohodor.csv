interestingasfuck,ffnfvim,t1_ffmfgmg,1580065361.0,"Whippets and sighthounds in general have a special gait where they get all of their feet off the ground when running. So it really doesn’t have to jump if they time it right.

Edit: It’s called a double suspension gallop for those interested"
JusticeServed,ffmjevj,t1_ffmi6m0,1580055508.0,"That’s true, I’m just wondering if it should be used for that. It’s stupid to lose a job over something you said to someone on Twitter. Are you supposed to research every person you reply to beforehand?"
JusticeServed,ffmhute,t1_ffmempc,1580054869.0,"I don’t think writing aka tweeting and all other internet posts should be judged as harshly as speaking. If she were to say this in a public space to this guys face then that would definitely be a red flag. It tells much more about a personality to be able to insult someone in person. To be able to tweet that to someone though? All it says to me is she’s slightly immature maybe, and very excited to have gotten a job at NASA. God knows I’ve said way worse shit online when I was younger discovering chat rooms."

I use a meat thermometer for cooking any kind of meat now it’s a game changer. Get the kind that you can leave in the meat while it cooks and monitor it with a receiver for bonus points."

My boy is two and does this when he A) wants to go for a run, B) wants me to pay attention to him instead of my phone/tv, or C) wants to go to sleep. Or more specifically wants to go to sleep with me. If he needs more exercise then take him for a walk, otherwise just ignore him if you dislike the behavior or try and go lay down with him for a little and see if he’ll fall asleep."

It says **A** Walmart did this experiment for a couple of months, and the article is from 2015, Walmart is not actively using facial recognition. All these people believing this shit don’t you think it would be common knowledge if one of the biggest grocery stores in the world rolled something like this out?"
wholesomememes,fdtho09,t1_fdst8zg,1578716903.0,"That's funny, well when you're young someone who's ""almost 30"" seems like this huge gap that you assume must change your personality drastically, then when you get there yourself you realize you feel exactly the same as you've always have. I'm 29 btw and also get mistaken for being younger all the time. Crazy what good genetics and taking care of yourself can do.

One of the reasons we're getting phones with four cameras and crap, they need new ways to justify you buying a new phone, performance improvements aren't big enough anymore.
