furry_irl,ffd0ssp,t1_ffcymqo,1579811173.0,"The book is a leather-bound tome. No obvious hints about its contents on the outside. You caught a glimpse of the inside earlier while getting down from the hole, but you can only remember strange symbols. Probably a spellbook.

Jackie notices your curiousity: ""He's distracted, it's up for grabs now.""

A tempting offer, to say the least."
furry_irl,ffcpgu1,t1_ffcoyj9,1579804432.0,"You remove your pendant from your neck. However, since it's still wrapped around your tail, he accidentally pulls it when grabbing it. He unwraps it, then pets you while saying something. ""Sorry"", probably. Jackie is visibly jealous.

The human is now only paying attention to your pendant. You think you're pretty much free to do whatever now, since he's occupied."
furry_irl,ffcoqfm,t1_ffcngwl,1579803976.0,"The human suddenly holds his chest and freezes for a second, with a funny expression on his face. He then casts a spell, and a spectral hand lays flat in front of you, like a platform.

Jackie jumps on, and the hand is already going down under her weight, so you wait for your turn. Once you're both down, he can't help but notice your pendant, and tries to inspect it while it's on you."
furry_irl,ffcnam4,t1_ffcmo8z,1579803086.0,"You decide that if you're going to be friendly, you might as well improve your chances by abusing your racial power.

Both of you stand at the edge of the hole, and make your best attempt at looking adorable and helpless.

furry_irl,ffcmhvj,t1_ffcllw3,1579802596.0,"""Okay, hear me out. We whine and look at him with puppy eyes, he gets us down and hopefully lets us go""

You somehow can't imagine that going as expected. You're strong now, but you can barely control it, let alone defend someone if something happens.

""Hey, look, he's doing something""

The human is waving at you, with his book open on the other hand.

""See? He's friendly, let's at least meet him. Unless you want to keep digging of course."""
furry_irl,ffclcw0,t1_ffck0nn,1579801913.0,"You stay quiet for a while, pondering what happened to your team. You're worried they might have not made it out in time, even if the exit was close.

Just when your thoughts drift towards the worst case, you hear a distant bark from the tunnel you've made. You run back and, what a surprise! It's Jackie, the dog that you almost hit before.

She tells you that everyone panicked and ran outside, so they must be fine.

""Well, why aren't you with them?"" you ask

""I froze for a moment and by the time I realized that I had to move, the exit was already blocked. I jumped in here as soon as I could. When it was all done, I tried to go back, but I couldn't dig through that layer of stone like you.""

You apologize, you just wanted to have a bit of fun.

""It's okay, I honestly was tired of working with them. We'll manage""

Feeling better about the situation, you turn back to the room, only to see a confused human looking back at you from below."
furry_irl,ffcjqqt,t1_ffcg0hh,1579800935.0,"You jump and dive into the hole, digging with your supercanid strength. You can  barely make out someone's voice before you go deeper: ""Wait, no! Boss wanted-""

You keep digging down a bit, and then forwards. You hear rocks entering the tunnel behind you. The cave must've collapsed. Good riddance too, they always kept the best for themselves! Now it's your turn.

Since you have no sense of direction down here, you simply keep digging forward, then you take a nap, then you keep going. Finally, the next ""step"" reveals a light. Not daylight, but a nice cool lightblue light.

From the opening you've made, you can see you're about 3 meters/10 feet from the very clean and polished floor. You are looking at what looks like a laboratory on a table between two pillars. A human is currently walking around the lab, reading a small notebook."
furry_irl,ffcflx3,t1_ffccqeq,1579798411.0,"The pendant glows, and as soon as your paws claw at the ground, you make a hole twice your size! The pendant was an amulet of incredible strength!

The ball of dirt flies towards the wall, barely missing one of your comrades. 4 dogs are looking at you now. Two are understandably surprised, one is cowering, and the other one cries out in excitement: ""Jackpot! We can get everything out so much faster now!""

You hear a little rumble and some pebbles fall from the ""roof"" of the cave. While not in immediate danger, another impact like that might cause it to collapse."
furry_irl,ffccl04,t1_ffc9pin,1579796538.0,"You put the pendant on the floor and think about how to wear it anyway. You wrap it a couple times on your tail and the rest of the length seems okay now (https://imgur.com/QSBVOuB).

You feel energized. A fellow digger looks at you and gives you a compliment: ""Lookin' good, lad. Just shorten it before ya lose it, aight?"""
furry_irl,ffc9eck,t1_ffc5pk5,1579794535.0,"You lift something that looks like a pendant, with a rough, green rock encrusted in the center. Clearly made for humanoids, as the chain is far too long for you to wear. Maybe if you replaced it with something else?

Your knowledge of arcana is limited, but you're certain it has *some* magical property."
furry_irl,ffc41hc,t1_ffc3cqm,1579791008.0,"You look around. You're in what appears to be the inside of a cave, and you see your fellow companions digging around for loot. One of them gives you a quick glance before going back to work.

There are little trinkets scattered throughout the dirty floor, most of them covered in dust. You can see a ray of light coming from the entrance, revealing even more dust scattered in the air."
furry_irl,ffc38ec,t1_ffc28fi,1579790435.0,"You sprint towards the ball, and only realize you had something else to do when it's in your possesion. You drop it and hope nobody saw that."
