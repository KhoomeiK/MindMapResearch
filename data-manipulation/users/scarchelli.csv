If you spend 90% of your limit and pay it 3 weeks later which is the day before your statement is drawn up, your utilization will be $0 or whatever you pay it down to.

By the way, you're referring to the rare credit card company who reports to the bureaus on a different day. Very uncommon, but call and check when they report.

personalfinance,fdklu8x,t3_elshda,1578506228.0,"This will likely get buried, but since the top comments haven't mentioned it, the ""don't charge more than 20%"" isn't correct, at all.  Credit cards are revolving debt where utilization is recorded MONTH TO MONTH based on the STATEMENT BALANCE, not what you charge.  If you have a credit limit of $10,000, you can charge any amount to it, just make sure you pay it down to below 20% BEFORE the statement date, or your scores will be affected from the higher utilization, but again, that is MONTH TO MONTH, there is no memory unlike a missed payment.  Then if you have a balance AFTER the statement (20% or less) pay it all off before the next statement to avoid interest.

I have a credit card with a $20,000 limit.  I charged $7000 to it one month for an emergency and planned on paying it that month with extra money I was going to have.  I didn't have all of the the extra money at first, but before the statement posted, I paid $3,000.  When it did post to my account, I owed $4,000 still (20% of my limit), which I paid when I got the other extra money toward the end of the month.  My next statement balance was $0 and I didn't owe any interest.

If you spend 90% of your limit and pay it 3 weeks later which is the day before your statement is drawn up, your utilization will be $0 or whatever you pay it down to.

By the way, you're referring to the rare credit card company who reports to the bureaus on a different day. Very uncommon, but call and check when they report.

Credit cards are revolving debt where utilization is recorded MONTH TO MONTH based on the STATEMENT BALANCE, not what you charge.  If you have a credit limit of $10,000, you can charge any amount to it, just make sure you pay it down to below 20% BEFORE the statement date, or your scores will be affected from the higher utilization, but again, that is MONTH TO MONTH, there is no memory unlike a missed payment.  Then if you have a balance AFTER the statement (20% or less) pay it all off before the next statement to avoid interest.

I have a credit card with a $20,000 limit.  I charged $7000 to it one month for an emergency and planned on paying it that month with extra money I was going to have.  I didn't have all of the the extra money at first, but before the statement posted, I paid $3,000.  When it did post to my account, I owed $4,000 still (20% of my limit), which I paid when I got the other extra money toward the end of the month.  My next statement balance was $0 and I didn't owe any interest.
