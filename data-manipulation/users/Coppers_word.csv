AskReddit,ff9c31w,t3_escys2,1579709573.0,Besides what has already been said. Try to kill 'em with kindness. Say good morning. Comment on stuff they said so they know you listen. Try to relate. You simply can't keep insulting someone nice who understands you or who knows you go to your grandparents on the weekends.
OverwatchUniversity,ff99hu7,t3_esd0yj,1579707924.0,"Use roll as an escape ability/emergency reload. When you flash, already have your cursor at head height so you only need to make a small adjustment. I also recommend putting flash on right click and fth on e, right click is easier to press (for e you have to lift a finger from wasd) and flash is an ability you need to use quickly."

Overwatch,fes42rx,t3_eqf44v,1579361184.0,If not for that rein charge I would have thought that the grav simply went through a gap in the rubble.
Competitiveoverwatch,feqjiot,t3_eqcgr5,1579342578.0,Look at that crosshair placement after sig uses his absorb. Your efforts are futile I know where you are going.

OverwatchUniversity,feguw99,t3_ep2ndn,1579103073.0,"1. Get a good and comfortable sensitivity - guides everywhere on this. Not too high not too low.
2. Get a general good aim and get used to different angles. Lots of aim guides out there. Start with stationary targets aim for the head/neck - predictable bots or skip this and do
3. Widow v widows. Other widows are imo easiest to hit since they often stand still. It will also help you get a feel for when to pull the trigger. Patience is important. 
4. Get used to where you need to aim for all heroes to hit their head hitboxes, this only comes with lots and lots of experience. Imo aim a little bit in front/above of most heroes.

If you notice yourself spamming shots calm down and take a more carefull aim, don't let yourself get pressured by that Moira flanker, a single shot and all that. Use corners, use highground. Have your crosshair in a postion where your enemy will be. Know that every shot broadcasts where you are on the map. Be unpredictable. Know that I'm going to copy paste expand on this from now on cause this is otherwise too much effort."
OverwatchUniversity,fegeawu,t3_ep14xk,1579089740.0,"If you have a Orisa or Lucio (or even a pharah basically anything with boop) anounce your ult location if possible so your team can cc people into it.

Even if you have no boop, splitting part of the enemy team off and having your team collapse on them is pretty valuable, even if you get no kills with the dragonstrike itself. 

Watch for movement abilities or zarya bubbles or Baptiste lamp and generally aim to where the enemy team wants to go."
Competitiveoverwatch,feg5p11,t1_fefjwhz,1579078127.0,"Maybe have her use some of her charge. Like Casting an extra bubble costs 50% charge. This might seem much but she'll get most of it back if it was a good bubble, it might even still be oppressive in the middle of a heated fight with 3 dps."

todayilearned,fds71jt,t1_fds55n2,1578695801.0,Try counting 100 kg of wriggling snakes. The only thing you might be able to do is do a crude guess based on the volume of the crate.

LifeProTips,fdkjiqz,t1_fdkes8s,1578505010.0,Yeah I edited my comment plus there's my reply but guess they were already typing. Anyway thanks for the explanation. Probably others who didn't know as well.
LifeProTips,fdk2y4p,t1_fdk1hf5,1578494770.0,"I guess in daylight it's okay. But imo in the dark brights are pretty damn bright and can blind not only the guy in front of you but also people in the opposing lane, even a quick on/off. That said I would probably do that if I was stuck behind someone for a longer time and they just don't get the message. I also think most people are too hasty while driving."
LifeProTips,fdk0n06,t1_fdjz0bt,1578493100.0,\^ TIL brights and fog lights are different. Brights can blind people in front of you as well as opposing drivers.
LifeProTips,fdjrjp0,t1_fdjmn6r,1578484823.0,"Imo best way to avoid road rage is to just accept bullshit from others on the road. Also not every guy who does something stupid is an asshole (Think this is called attribution bias or something).

But people can be petty af, my colleague was driving on the speeding lane and some guy behind us used the ~~fog~~ brights/high beam/big headlights to signal he wanted to pass. All right pretty annoying, borderline dangerous but ok. So afterwards guy was slowing down and eventually we wanted to pass him in the same way but my colleague decided it was time for revenge and used his headlights as well. Other guy then proceeded to drive behind us for +5 min. with his ~~fog~~ lights on.... Honestly, it sucks but stuff like this can be prevented easily if you forget your pride and suck it up.

Edit: I meant brights instead of fog lights. I didn't know the difference plus I didn't know the actual english word, TIL :)"

OverwatchUniversity,fddx303,t3_ekupds,1578326089.0,I've been learning Hammond on an alt. I've found learning roll outs is very helpful. Knowing where to hook to get to specific locations or places where you can swing around once you know the trick. Find the sneaky way to do your high ground boops.
OverwatchUniversity,fd8kr21,t3_ek776u,1578219562.0,"I once put boop on spacebar and jump on rightclick. Now I have jump on space AND rightclick and boop on scroll, I might try again if I get used to jump on right-click but I also see no reason to since this feels comfortable. Switch on shift and melee on sidebutton."
Competitiveoverwatch,fcxityo,t3_ejekej,1578064004.0,"Not a buff but I'd like a toggle for semi auto/full auto shooting, so you burst fire accurate fire. I mean I know you can do that manually but that'd be a huge QOL thingie for me at least. 

Other thing could be a that consecutive bullets on the same target increase in damage (maybe start with lower damage and definitely set a max). Similar to sym beam but it's lost when you target someone else.

Last time this came up I suggested a more powerfull melee attack on a cooldown."

Competitiveoverwatch,fcmx8vj,t3_ehrxg2,1577796314.0,"Vs rein it could be a buff. Now you pull rein with your intended target letting Rein shield them (unless you pull far enough away from the Rein ofc). If orb only pulls one, you might be able to pull combo a squishy right behind the rein."
LifeProTips,fcie4b0,t1_fci7k7h,1577661180.0,"Garages? They'd have to get in somehow, so I'd say they should be able to get out. That said, one of our cats once got stuck in our neighbours garden, he jumped in but the walls were too high to get out, or so we thought. Long story short, he got out as soon as we tried to get in (we waited hours, tried other stuff before attempting)

We have a specific whistle sequence for food. I like to think they are smart enough to tell the difference between normal whistling and our special whistle but they are always asking for food so it's hard to tell."
getdisciplined,fciba0t,t1_fci8ogg,1577660047.0,Figured from your second comment. I wouldn't worry about it. You only learn stuff like that by experiencing it. I recommend watching a lot of movies and series :)

getdisciplined,fcedius,t3_eh3xnn,1577619442.0,"I mostly agree but I also think even independent adults still need their parents for advice/emotional support/etc. and that's perfectly fine. After all they probably know you best and have had more years of (life) experience. Staying at home longer also isn't all bad as long as you still work or study (I think you mentioned this in your post), it helps you pay off student loans/build a reserve fund and gives you more time for self improvement. 

But Im literally writing this on my parents bed with our cat on my ass so what do I know."
