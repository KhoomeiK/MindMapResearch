news,ffo8ctl,t1_ffo5eo5,1580075127.0,"He was known to be a bit wild when he was younger but I think he fully grew out of that and is a responsible person now. Everybody is more wild in their late teens and early 20s, they’re just not rich and famous and can’t go as hard. But then most people grow out of it, as did he it seems"

Fitness,ffo4snj,t3_eu8vka,1580074170.0,My long runs usually aren’t intense and it’s the time for me to just think. It’s a very different mindset. It’s very meditative for me and I often do it just to clear my head. I’ll have an album playing that I half pay attention to.
leaves,ffl4yfj,t3_eu0chx,1580034883.0,This is probably my favorite story I've seen on this sub. Thank you for sharing. And bicycling from Mexico to Canada is a huge deal! That's awesome that you did that with your son. Great way to change the generational guidance.

Fitness,ffhhffk,t1_ffhhbnf,1579935375.0,"Honestly it may be time for me to switch and do this. Though I love the pool, the sauna, the multiple locations, and not gonna lie the tons of hot guys at my gym. But yeah I need to get a good fucking workout in, not have to deal with all of this stress to even be able to work out. This amount of stress is just going to make me stop going."

Just do hydrogen peroxide. Put it in a cotton ball and do one drop at a time because if you pour it all in the pressure could rupture your ear drum."

INTP,ffgjtyd,t1_ffgjf6d,1579907883.0,People have thought I was a stoner from ages 17-now (28). Well they were conflicted because they thought I was on drugs but also thought I was too innocent for it. I was an actual sort of stoner ages 19-21 but now only smoke infrequently. Weed doesn’t mesh well with my brain. But I do enjoy psychedelics from time to time
getdisciplined,ffgharl,t1_ffga27x,1579906217.0,"Selective service was a mistake it was supposed to say US census, I made an association mistake when writing that down because in the app they needed my selective service number and I didn’t know it. 

And I’m actually 28, but I still carry the curiosity and strangeness of a youngster around inside me"
INTP,ffgh3t1,t1_ffgem2k,1579906095.0,Totally true! And I’m really spacey in general. People still think I’m high all of the time because it’s the simplest solution to them as to why I’m a bit odd. By this point I don’t even argue with it ha. Like my local bartenders who I know well casually mentioned that I come in high all of the time and I didn’t correct them
