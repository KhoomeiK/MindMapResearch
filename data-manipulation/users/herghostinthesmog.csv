Unfortunately I doubt that was the context here..."
fatlogic,fdg9z7k,t1_fdg1bmy,1578386480.0,Yeah OP might be reading a bit too far into this. I think they were just trying to combine 2 news into one (Adele is looking skinny + she left a huge tip)
fatlogic,fdg9v14,t1_fdg9e5k,1578386328.0,Depends. Very tall women get a lot of shit and so do many guys who are significantly taller than average.

fatlogic,fckmkc9,t1_fckm5zm,1577728583.0,"Yeah, why not. Just make sure you're within the healthy BMI range, preferrably closer to the lower end."
fatlogic,fcjkz9d,t1_fciwywx,1577691892.0,It seems to be a troll.

fatlogic,fc5uhpi,t3_efwg4z,1577466169.0,"My boyfriend grew up poor, and is used to only eating 1 hot meal a day (lunch), with dinner usually consisting of bread or rolls with something. So I've been learning how to make a bunch of different spreads that incorporate veggies. Here's a carrot one I haven't been able to find online, save for websites from my own country.   


What you need:  
1 fresh carrot (grated)  
cheese (grated)  
a pinch of black pepper  
garlic (optional)  
1 boiled egg (optional)  
a dash of mustard  
\+ something to form a base for the spread. Options include: butter & butter substitutes, cream cheese, quark, cottage cheese, yoghurt, mayo...  


Mix everything together. You don't need a lot of the cheese, but there should be enough that it's visible in the spread. If it doesn't ""connect"", add some more mustard, and if it's too thick, you can dilute it with a little bit of water or milk."
xxfitness,fc2ino8,t1_fc1146l,1577362262.0,Thanks for the heads-up
