We have 3 and they are the sweetest dogs ever, only time they jump at you is to get a big hug.

And I'm down for something like this, although we probably won't get anything like that. 

Even if the section of the City we had the mission in to fight Ghaul was opened back up for patrols and such, I'm ok with that. That area was probably the highlight of those missions for me since we were able to get into the City proper."

Although my knife throwing skills aren't at that level."
destiny2,ffdosli,t3_et2022,1579825432.0,"Very much so. 

Venus was a gorgeous planet, with all the Vex buildings around, and the cave system that led you to a gigantic Fallen Ketch. It was a great place to just patrol. 

When I hop back in to D1 occasionally I will go there and just drive around, hoping to see a team start the VoG raid so I can watch and help."
OgresGoneWild,ffd2fmx,t1_ffbryxu,1579812089.0,"We are pretty good, although I'm exhausted from work lately. Putting in mad hours and I just don't have time for anything really. Hopefully it will lessen some soon, I need it. And yeah, the weather that time was ridiculously warm, I remember going to the beach for Xmas and wearing shorts, that's stupid. 

Glad you are well though, and congrats on the job/election coming up, I couldn't do that. I don't like people that much to try to run for an elected job. 

I'd vote for you though, you sexy beast."

If you don't have the frame, get it from Ada and do whatever steps it gives you until the frame is ready for the Forge."
destiny2,ffaqpug,t3_esljy6,1579742263.0,"Just take a step back and relax. 

For someone new like you there is a lot to do, but that's a good thing, at least you have plenty of things to do and won't get too bored. 

Look at one of your quests and see what you might think you'll have the most fun doing. If you enjoy PvP then chase a pinnacle weapon there, or if you think you'll go for the PvE side, start with like the Izanagis quest, that's a fantastic gun to get. 

In the end it just comes down to what you want to do to keep you happy."
destiny2,ff9w74z,t1_ff9vxet,1579722847.0,"I second this. 

Maybe it could be a little better, but it's still enjoyable."
CasualConversation,ff9vf8x,t3_esgx89,1579722347.0,"Kind of. 

I don't follow sports at all, just never have. Still, I will occasionally see or watch highlights on YouTube or the news and see some great plays, and they are fun to see."

And I probably agree with Skolas there, that fight was amazing the first time I did it, and even after that it's still a fantastic run. 

I miss that dude."
DestinyTheGame,ff91epu,t3_esccuq,1579702425.0,"Randomly patrolling Venus and helping 5 people open the Vault, then getting an invite to do a run even though I've never raided before. 

That was the start of my addiction to the game and getting a fantastic friend out of that run? I'll never forget that time. 

Plus it was nice getting the FateBringer the first run too, even though it was the y1 version, a few in that team still never had it."

Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon.

However there is a deeper lore than what's presented, so watching a video on it can be fun if you enjoy those kinds of stories. MyNameIsByf on YouTube is one of the great lore talkers, he actually has a full story video on his channel, but it's over an hour so get some popcorn."

She has all the stories there you can play, doing that will get you gear as you go and you'll get more immersed in the story. 

As you go you'll get quests and such to do the strikes, those are easier as you play and figure out the details of them. 

Other than that, just go talk to all the vendors in the Tower and planets, grab bounties from them (they help a lot with experience and rewards) and when you want to take a break, hop back into PvP. 

There's also places to go to look for players to help you, r/fireteams is a good start, then you can grab someone who can help you in game."
