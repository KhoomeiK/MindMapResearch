schizophrenia,fcl9rv5,t1_fcl7hyj,1577742900.0,I am so so sorry! I edited the post. My whole idea of schizopfrenia came from tv films and shows. I will continue to do more research.
schizophrenia,fcl9f1i,t1_fcl61js,1577742676.0,"Thank you so so much! You basically answered my question. I edited the post, you made me realize that what I wrote was really harmful. I just want him to feel safe and cared for, I love him with all my heart. I will continue to do more research. Thank you again."
schizophrenia,fcl92xm,t1_fcl6b5l,1577742464.0,"I am so sorry it came across that way, I really didn't mean it! I edited the post, I hope it makes more sense now. We talked about it in the past, but he kind of brushed it off. Will start the conversation again though, I want him to get the help he needs. Thank you so much, and I am sorry I came accros so heartless."

relationship_advice,fcknqc6,t1_fcklbte,1577729298.0,"He said he wants to, just not right now. I know how this sounds, I feel like I'm being so naive. I'm telling my side of the story as I know it, yes he might be lying to me. I don't know how much he really uses, but it doesn't affect the way he looks. 
And yeah I know. Thank you."
relationship_advice,fckmhf3,t1_fckh1po,1577728533.0,I want to see if I can make him get the help he needs first. Thank you for your concern.
relationship_advice,fckm3p2,t1_fckhp6p,1577728300.0,"The drug he's taking is mepfedrone, meth isn't that easy to get here. Yes, I agree, he shouldn't even be smoking pot with his condition. 
I'll talk to him about seeing a psychiatrist, and hopefully he agrees. Even if not in a relationship, I care for him and want him to get the help he needs."
relationship_advice,fckk3y4,t1_fckhhjx,1577727069.0,"I am planning on talking to him about it the next time we see eachother, it's just so hard, I hate confronting people. I really hope we can get through this, I believe recovery is possible."
