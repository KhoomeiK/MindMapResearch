cars,fgm3qn3,t1_fgijrv6,1580917450.0,"Nah some dealerships (like carmax) do it that way. I think it’s kinda cool in a way. You just have to worry about selling lots of cars, rather than knowing which car we “stole” or which one we put a bunch of work into so it has no profit anymore. For a couple months we were buying shit used cars and having to put way too much money into them, so they were all “minis” (which we got $100 for). It turned it from just selling cars to this game of find the needle in the haystack where there’s one or two cars that are actually worth selling and the rest were minis. Or if you were good at selling (I, admittedly, was not) you could maybe close a new car with all the features and make 200-300 bucks. It was a huge pain in the ass. They lost almost all of their top salesmen when they changed that payplan."
cars,fghqg94,t3_eye2fu,1580791022.0,Sold Honda’s for a little while. I always preferred selling used cars. Profit on the new cars was next to nothing. I’d make maybe $250 bucks if we didn’t discount the car at all and the customer bought all the dealer add-ons. I could make $800 selling the right used car.

sports,fgc8oc7,t1_fga7odv,1580670217.0,American football stops play for an “injury timeout” so I was also confused. Am-Footballs a little different than most sports though because each play is already separated.

But otherwise I’m with you. Crack a beer or two, put on some good tunes or your favorite show and settle in. Gumbo is maybe my favorite thing to make because it’s simple yet labor intensive, then when all the hard parts done and everybody’s in the pool, you just let it roll and imbue your house with gumbo smells until it’s done."

But solid hobby. Everyone’s got their own taste. I too have way more guitars than I need, kudos to you for giving them the attention they deserve. One thing I will say about it, I have never seen a guitar like this, and that’s pretty cool."
