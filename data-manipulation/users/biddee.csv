Parenting,fgmnpjc,t1_fgmlano,1580928326.0,One of my other friends said this. I will emphasise that she buys her own drinks and make sure she watches her friends for if it happens to them.
Parenting,fgmj5te,t1_fgmi0r2,1580925633.0,I have never been able to smoke when drunk. It makes me puke every single time. Granted it's been years since I've smoked but that is the one thing I've never been able to do is mix the two.
Parenting,fgmc8ci,t1_fgm3b3f,1580921805.0,"I have a colleague that's very into weed. I used to smoke years ago, but wouldn't have the first clue these days. I'm wondering if I should get my colleague to come and talk to her about it. I'll speak to her and see if she wants to know more."
Parenting,fgm394b,t1_fgm24sc,1580917146.0,"Believe me, the thought has crossed my mind. But I can't keep her sheltered forever and she's going to need to learn to negotiate these situations by herself."
Parenting,fgm2eyq,t1_fgm1izy,1580916615.0,"She wouldn't have the first clue what to do with a bag of weed! LOL. We don't smoke weed or drink at home, but I may be able to get her some edibles and let her try them at home."
Parenting,fgm278k,t1_fgm1khe,1580916480.0,That is a good idea too. I'll ask if she wants to go for pizza with them before the party.
Parenting,fgm0q66,t1_fglxsjj,1580915531.0,"Yeah me too! Mine's 16 now, and I have to nag her to do her chores!"
Parenting,fglzg9c,t1_fglyfgm,1580914681.0,That is a great idea. Thanks!
Parenting,fgly9z2,t1_fgly0qv,1580913879.0,Why? I live where you vacation :D
Parenting,fglxwex,t1_fglxr6x,1580913620.0,Driving age here is 18 so I'll be dropping and picking them up. None of them have licenses yet.
findareddit,fglsdes,t1_fglib9f,1580909744.0,Empty suitcases are so annoying. It's so obvious they have no weight at all.
aww,fgg90ph,t1_fgg7zeb,1580756845.0,"My dog does the same, he likes to poop as far away from the house as possible too, so all his poop is in the bushes along the fence.  


Unfortunately we're not so lucky with the puppy as she just poops anywhere in the garden, including on the pathway where everyone walks!"
IAmA,fgfjnuh,t1_fgffcud,1580740566.0,"There is a very big difference between breeding dogs for working and breeding dogs for show. When you end up with dogs like the english bulldog and pug who have terrible issues congenitally there is a huge problem.   


Anecdotally, we rescued a purebred rottweiler who had been surrendered by a breeder as she had congenital hip displacement - she had to be put down at the age of 8 because she could not walk. The vet said she saw a lot of large purebreeds with this issue."
IdiotsInCars,fgfcwky,t1_fgezz9v,1580734820.0,I was in Miami last year and calling an Uber was a crapshoot because you cannot see the license of the car coming towards you so you have no idea if that's your uber or not. It's just weird.
Parenting,fge3ogq,t1_fge30xv,1580690631.0,"Maybe start small, have a picnic or tea party with the kids at home and keep them out of mom's hair for a couple of hours. 

It's a little concerning that she doesn't trust you with your own kids but it sounds like she def needs a break. Does she trust anyone (grandparents etc)?"
nakedandafraid,fgdz2ma,t3_exlmp0,1580688567.0,Also insects.
Parenting,fgdy45d,t1_fgdqc36,1580688287.0,The best thing you could do for your wife is take the kids out for a few hours / the day. Just let her have time at home to do nothing/relax. Make sure all the chores are done first though.
fatlogic,fg79ceg,t1_fg70m78,1580587046.0,You don't get to 300lb by only eating 3 slices of pizza occasionally. Plus metabolism slows with age so it is normal for your mom to eat less and weigh more.
politics,fg65fn3,t1_fg5wuyy,1580554579.0,"I use multiple sites and avoid opinion articles. For straight up news, Reuters, BBC and al Jazeera are good at covering US news. Nyt and wapo are good for in depth looks at certain subjects (the long read is usually excellent). Obv, dont try to get unbiased middle east reporting from al Jazeera!"
tifu,fg63fe1,t1_fg52ot4,1580551558.0,"Last weekend I did my first ever hash and coming down towards the end, I feel my bowels ready to burst. I knew I wasn't going to make it. We passed a church with a group of kids playing outside so I asked if I could use their bathroom. I went in an it was the nastiest, funniest, stinkiest poop. I went to flush and the toilet did one of those half flushes where no nothing goes down. I lifted the tank and there was no water going in, so I had to go out and apologize for leaving a toilet full of poop in their church. So embarrassing!"
fatlogic,fg62znz,t1_fg4vlqv,1580550912.0,"Yep, my husband is 3 inches taller than me. I'm constantly salty that he gets to eat more than me."
fatlogic,fg4t558,t1_fg4t1x2,1580510538.0,I'm 3 inches shorter than my husband. Of course I'm supposed to eat less than him.
AmItheAsshole,fg3eni1,t1_fg1cgz5,1580479554.0,"My daughter turned 16 this month. We asked her if she wanted a party, she said no, she wanted to go hiking. So I took her on a hike where she was bored shitless until she found the bones of a dead sheep. That made her happy and she spent the rest of the hike with the skull of the sheep plus carrying a lot of other bones. She's fascinated with bones."
YouShouldKnow,fg0loap,t1_ffzwgqh,1580410299.0,I was getting ready to take her to the vet!
My600lbLife,fg03g6d,t1_ffzdauy,1580399371.0,And yet the pentagon budget increases every single year. The amount of money America spends on its military is staggering.
YouShouldKnow,ffzt8ri,t3_evzv66,1580392231.0,"We have 2 dogs and my husband keeps complaining because he's not allowed to feed them cooked bones. I keep showing him articles about bones getting stuck in dogs' intestines, but he thinks it's safe. We do give them raw bones though. Saying that the other day we gave them a turkey bone each and the year old pup was coughing like she had something stuck in her throat, so I tried to see what it was and I couldn't see anything. It took about 10 minutes of feeling in her mouth and throat before I found the culprit. One of the bones had gotten stuck on her tooth.   


Glad your doggo is ok OP."
AskReddit,ffwdgg7,t1_ffw39yz,1580296612.0,There are a lot of dogs in my neighborhood and they bark constantly. My dogs generally ignore them but sometimes there will be a bark that sets off my dogs. Very obvious they communicate.
AskReddit,ffwd9bf,t1_ffveiuk,1580296350.0,Omg I just burst out laughing.
Parenting,ffw7b4d,t1_ffueuel,1580287714.0,"Tbh, I have no idea but it wouldn't surprise me."
Parenting,ffuec76,t1_ffuchjk,1580240173.0,I think at around 5 a full bladder will wake them up.
Parenting,ffuc6o2,t1_ffu9obo,1580238892.0,Pick her up when you go to bed and she's asleep and put her on the toilet. She will pee. It really works.
Parenting,fftj90d,t1_ffthh02,1580221996.0,Night time is challenging. For me it was taking her to the toilet when I went to bed - they will usually sleep pee - and limiting liquids in the evening - even then she was 4 before we stopped having (occasional) accidents (day trained by 2). AFAIK night time potty training is developmental (ie it's not a learned skill) and sometimes their bladders are just too small to handle keeping it in overnight until they're a little older.
Parenting,fftgd5l,t1_fftds18,1580219770.0,"Most children start showing an interest in using the toilet sometime between 18 months and 2 years old. It is a short window when they realise and can feel themselves needing to pee or poo (can't necessarily hold it yet but they recognise the sensation). If you catch them in that window, you can usually potty train in a week or so. If you don't catch that window, the child gets used to the sensation of peeing and pooing in their diaper/underwear and doing it on the toilet feels weird and wrong making potty training much more difficult and you are more likely to have to wait til they're 3 or so."
MorbidReality,fftcxe2,t1_ffta37m,1580216795.0,When the two guys came up to greet the cameraman it looked one of them stepped on a piece of human body.
ChoosingBeggars,ffr8m49,t1_ffr3lv3,1580152828.0,Ehh I know a fair amount of functional drug addicts.
ChoosingBeggars,ffr2ms3,t3_eulm34,1580149111.0,"There is a crackhead that is always either at the local KFC or supermarket. He's pretty young and able-bodied and I always wonder why he doesn't take the time he spends at these place begging, to go and get a real job (even if menial)."
AmItheAsshole,ffflwoa,t1_ffelm74,1579886789.0,"You're NTA cos they're your eggs, at the same time having a niece or nephew that is biologically yours takes out all of the worry about having your own kids. JMO."
politics,fff4f3y,t1_ffemqa1,1579875419.0,"If Bernie wins, next time for warren, she would be 74 or 78 years old. I personally believe Bernie is too old and that Warren should take the nomination."
DebunkThis,ffdex76,t1_ffd1bru,1579819438.0,I think that it's been proven time and again how willing anti-abortion ppl are to lie (planned parenthood selling baby parts comes to mind).
DebunkThis,ffd018m,t1_ffcyo09,1579810751.0,I really can't answer either of those questions. It could be fake. IDK. Is that what you're trying to debunk? Does it matter if it's real or fake?
DebunkThis,ffcw8g4,t1_ffclbup,1579808565.0,"I'm not sure what you are trying to debunk? Does the video show an abortion? Possibly. Does an abortion kill a fetus, yes. The thing is, the video could be showing a non-viable fetus. We don't know. Any which way, it is a medical procedure and it is graphic. Certainly watching it will not make me anti-choice because I don't believe it is my or anyone else's place to tell anyone what they should do with their body."

AskReddit,ff6aa2m,t1_ff5fb1p,1579622781.0,"Actually you're not supposed to do this anymore due to the arsenic content of rice. You are better off cooking it in excess liquid, when the rice is done pour off the excess liquid and then leave it to steam for a few minutes with the lid on.

AskReddit,ff6a3cs,t1_ff653zl,1579622660.0,"I often add flour to sauces to thicken and I've never had them taste floury even though I add it at the last minute with no further cooking. Eg when making mac and cheese, I flour the cheese which both thickens the sauce and helps the cheese melt better - that's just added to hot pasta, with no further cooking."
