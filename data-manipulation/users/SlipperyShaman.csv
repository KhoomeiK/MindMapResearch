At the very least, make sure you have an actual job offer (not just a message on linked from a recruiter expressing high level interest) before you try to use it as leverage for a pay increase. 

Also, timing couldn't be worse assuming your company's fiscal matches calendar. Budget allocations for pay increases are usually accounted for/approved by this time so there might be additional obstacles in requesting a pay raise at this time of year."

In general, refinancing higher interest debt with lower interest is usually a sound financial move. But also determine how you got into the CC debt in the first place. Simply moving your CC debt to a PL and then racking up CC debt again will leave you in a worse position."

personalfinance,fcxpr1i,t1_fcxoaar,1578068575.0,"110% depends on your employer, and TBH my employer wasn't always so great at the recognition piece but have come a long way over the last few years. Jumping jobs is usually less of an uphill battle and tends to pay off more. I'm fortunate and grateful to have found a great company to grow with... 5 positions/4 promotions & 4X salary increase over 8 years is hard to find. 

Negotiating when they are weak can really go either way... I think the outcome really hinges on the overall value you bring to the organization and using a data/fact driven approach when requesting a salary increase."
personalfinance,fcxl3pp,t3_ejf2e8,1578065555.0,"I was in this exact situation about 8 months ago. 4 man team, we lost two employees (my direct manager) and another consultant within 60 days of each other... its a unique role in a niche market and it takes time to find the right people to hire.... on average 4-6 months. 

So the last 8 months were extremely demanding and difficult. No PTO for 4+ months, consistent 60-70 hour work weeks, lots of last minute travel... just trying to carry the workload of 3 people while we hired additional consultants. My job only got more demanding after we hire 3 new people as I had to train and review all their numbers... all the while not a manager. 

2 months into the increased work load I thought long and hard about squeezing my employer for more money / present them with an ultimatum.... I've squeezed them for more money several times over the last 8 years and have had mixed results. I didn't, but shortly after my boss gave me a $5k mid-year raise as a thank you for the dedication and focus... I was really looking more for a $20k increase but left the conversation alone and was grateful for the money I didn't have to ask for. 

For the next 6 months I just bit the bullet and worked my ass off... I'm 32 years old, single, no kids... I figured if there is any time in my life to dedicate 70 hours a week to my career, that time is right now.

I took great notes over the last 6 months in prep for my year end review... saved all the 'atta boy emails, customer accolades, lists of accomplishments, quantified additional revenue brought to the business... everything. I painted the full picture but at the end of the day didn't have to... my boss also took detailed notes of my efforts and really went to bat for me. My year end review ended in a 6 week bonus, a $30k annual pay increase, flexibility to work remote 90 of the time and talks of moving into management near term. 

So long story NOT short... what I'm trying to get at is for the first time in my life I was patient about something, didn't put my employer against the ropes when they were already hurting, worked my ass off and it all paid off. I understand you see the additional work load coming down the pipe and you want to be compensated for that, but you will most likely need to prove to your employer that you can handle all of the work consistently before your pay is adjusted. Without proving it first, you are essentially asking to be paid in advance for work that hasn't been completed. 

Asking for more money never hurts, but be prepared with facts and do your research on market/industry average salaries for what you do. Have a 'reach' number in mind to strive for, but also have a realistic number you will be happy with. 

At the very least, express your concerns with your boss about the increased workload/expectations. Have some open dialogue and set the stage for a mid-year performance review creating opportunity for a merit increase based on you crushing the next 6 months. 

Good luck stranger, get that money!"
