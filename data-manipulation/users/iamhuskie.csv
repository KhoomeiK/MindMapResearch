AskReddit,feo683g,t3_eq1wzh,1579295677.0,Right now my fiancée and I are having a high risk pregnancy. We are at 21 weeks and have a lot of complications. The doctors are telling us we will have a premature birth. I would be 100% happy if our son develops enough to survive. We need to hit 24 weeks minimum to have a chance but 28 weeks is the ideal number.
