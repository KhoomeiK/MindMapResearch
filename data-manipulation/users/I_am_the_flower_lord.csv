cats,ffeh9ed,t1_ffe3zrb,1579847942.0,"White cats with blue eyes have much higher chance to be deaf, it's documented. White cats with one eye blue and the other in different color have a much higher chance to be deaf on the ear that is next to the blue eye. That is also documented. That means that ""white cats with blue eyes are always deaf"" is a myth, but ""white cats with blue eyes have higher chance to be deaf than other cats"" is truth, backed up by research. I'd say you lucked out on a hearing one, because as much as I love my Ghost, he just doesn't seem to shut up. Ever. Obnoxious little fart. 

My source: white prick with heterochromia (one eye blue, one eye gold), which was taken to various vets, where I was told these things. Though it turns out he is deaf on both ears, but that's just him being over the top as always."
cats,ffegnej,t1_ffe9mmr,1579847263.0,"I raise you my Ghost, who is white and has only one blue eye (the other one is gold) and yet he is wholly deaf too. There are exceptions to rules - and even though white cats with two blue eyes are usually deaf, that doesn't mean that there aren't such cats that hear. :)"
skyrim,febfp0r,t1_febdn19,1578958318.0,"Haha, I get your point. But if I play that way, then that means it's entirely possible to show this to a kid and say ""just stay on main roads and in cities"". Kids under 5 are too young to actually understand most mechanics in game, so chances are that not only will they follow your instructions and yell for help when a simple crab attacks them, but maybe even ask you to play for them while they tell you where to go and what to do, so it'll be even easier to avoid sacrificing people. ;)"
skyrim,fe25cpx,t1_fe04a5f,1578834675.0,"My playtroughs are full of woodchopping, gathering, horse riding and crafting. The only killing I had was when I played a hunter and a mage in winterhold - thanks to the mod that let's you start in other places. I usually don't even own armors and weapons other than daggers. Skyrim absolutely can be played by a 4 year old, and in my opinion it's as good as Minecraft. Fortnite on the other hand... Nope, not for kids under 10."
memes,fdwkfgi,t1_fdw11hz,1578759638.0,"My family has a ""tradition"" that when we eat together, the TV must be on, and only dad can control the remote. I moved out few years ago, and now I visit maybe once a month, with my fiancé. Still, the TV is always on and I can just eat and watch TV and don't talk to anyone at all and it's okay by their standards. 

The second I pull out the phone to just answer someone on fb, I'm criticised for ""being unsocial, non stop on the phone, having no life other than this small screen""."
cats,fdtisf7,t1_fdrdhak,1578717361.0,"I don't know if it is entirely true, but when we wanted to adopt a sister for our Ghost, they told us that actually male-male relationships are usually the best, as they won't fight much. Female-male are medium, and female-female are the worst. They said that as long as you have space big enough for both of them to not fight over it (with shelfs or cat houses so they're not entirely on floor level), male-male are best with each other.

We still adopted a girl, and judging by their relationship now, I think it would actually be better if we adopted her brother, because he seemed like more shy, timid one. She's a little princess and tries to steal the spotlight everytime. Now she and Ghost get jealous of each other and actually fight over who will sleep closer to us (she wins because she's smaller and can sleep on my chest lol).

As to the actual question - Ghost for almost 3 months was Lilith, even though he went trough 2 different vets and was ""inspected"" by an avid cat. So yeah, it can happen, and I'd imagine it's really common."
CozyPlaces,fdo53fs,t1_fdo05mx,1578599047.0,"In Poland responsibility for the house lays on the owners. So if you own a cottage like this, you have to maintain it alone. If you have shared ownership, with one other family for example, you have agreements like paying 50/50, or one family pays for the renovation of the roof and the other pays for insulation - though the latter one is rare and usually happens only when the families are a part of one bigger family. I think you can apply for help if it's old enough, but first you have to go trough so much paperwork that usually it's not worth it. If it's a family home ""trough generations, build by grandfather"" then usually families stay there, at least old people, and try to maintain it no matter the cost."
TheSimsBuilding,fdd1ob0,t3_ekdje2,1578291259.0,"I don't know why but the chairs got me. Like, I know it takes time and effort to build this house, and you obviously did some research / know how to build in this style.

 And yet only at the moment I saw ""dancing chairs"" I thought ""wow, they really put a lot of effort into it!"".

Obviously it's a great built but damn. The chairs. Perfect."
raisedbynarcissists,fd4wz91,t1_fd4fk4t,1578171868.0,"I think some narcs genuinely don't remember and make up new story, about how they are the good side. My mom had this blind rage, when she just couldn't remember what she did. But, since it was rage and she always did something bad during this time, she wouldn't listen to our version and would make up a new one, in which she didnt do the bad thing we accused her of, someone else did, or she did it, but it was entirely our fault.

Example: I wanted to help her with something she struggled to do on pc. She took it as mocking somehow, and started yelling at me ""do you think I'm stupid?!"". I wanted to back off, but she grabbed me by the arm and forced me to sit by her to help. I pushed her and ran to my room, where I discovered 4 bleeding holes in my arm. 5 minutes later she came to ""check something in my wardrobe"", and when she saw me (crying from pain, trying to wash the blood) she started yelling at me again - ""I didn't do that to you, I have too short nails! See? You did it to yourself to make me the bad one! Stop lying to everyone!"".

I thought that maybe she is actually lying and remembers what she did to me (since it happened literally 5 minutes ago and she obviously made up the excuse of checking my wardrobe), but she was panicked, horrified, she genuinely looked like a person who saw mentally unstable daughter hurt herself to get back at her. I think she remembered only that we had a fight, so she wanted to make amends with me, but when she saw the blood her mind went ""nope, definitely not my fault"" and made up a story where it's in fact not her fault. I still have funny looking scars and my brother saw all of this and has my side, so jokes of you mom lol"
memes,fcqfay1,t1_fcq90li,1577884909.0,"More like teased it, since Moana premiered a few months later, so I'm fairly sure it was already almost finished by then. [Here is a screen of the scene](https://9gag.com/gag/aOvyGOr) :)"
memes,fcq68v5,t1_fcpedkj,1577879648.0,"I was confused too! We rewatched it in Christmas and there was a scene where the weasel sells cds or something, and just for a second there are 3-4 films on the screen. The first one is Meowana. I immediately googled it and yep, she came out a few months later :D"
memes,fcp8zn7,t1_fcolmxn,1577854533.0,"The same year as Zootopia (which came out in February 2016, and teased Moana in one of the scenes)! And while we're at it, Frozen came out in 2013 (7 years ago!). Oh, and Tangled? That shit is from 2010! Happy New Year! :D"
AskReddit,fcp8f5l,t3_eic8yl,1577853957.0,"Of course I do. I'd never enter romantic relationship with my ex gf, but I'd gladly help her out of her toxic environment as a best friend. After that I'll wait for a few years, doing what I did anyway but without being such a bitch to people. I'd go to the doctor when I turn 16 to check on my allergies and other shit I should get checked as a kid but my parents were dumb and now I can't even go to work because I am just useless until I treat at least some of them. 

And then, when I'll turn 17, I'll register into the game I found my ex in, found his guild, and write to my now fiance and we will hit it off like we did years ago but couldn't be together since I made a lot of bad choices instead of one right one."
AskReddit,fcomtlt,t3_ei4bkv,1577836179.0,"The witcher... So, depends. If it's Jaskier alone, then I'm pretty fucked. If it's Geralt, Triss, Yen or all of them? Yeah, I'll even humor the kidnappers and try to joke a bit before they die."
AskReddit,fcmcbsq,t1_fckyvbe,1577770315.0,"It's 6:30 am here. I, again, didn't sleep the whole night and, again, I'll get scolded for that. My fiance knows that I see and hear (mostly hear) things that he won't, but I don't think he actually realises how fucking exhausting it is. He thinks I'm pulling all-nighters because I like to stay all night on reddit/play on pc, and when I try to tell him that it's just easier to sleep in the daylight, preferably when he's awake to ""protect me"", he seems to not understand. Any ideas how I can change it?

Also I looked up weighted blankets in my country. Pricey, but I think I'll go for it sometime during next year. Thank you!"
AskReddit,fcm9k40,t1_fcm8kvc,1577767925.0,"My ex threw a party the night we officially broke up. According to one of attendees (his roommate, my friend, who went there only for the free pizza), he casually grabbed the box with our ""toys"" and proceeded to tell everyone what exactly he did with them to me. Apparently he wanted to hand them out, too, and one roommate (not my friend) took the whole box.

youseeingthisshit,fcm6byq,t1_fckw50i,1577765367.0,"One of our cats recognises himself in the mirror. He also utilises it - he's deaf, so he won't hear me opening wet food. His sister hears it from the floor above though. He likes to sit near mirrors to have a full view of the room he's in, to see when she gets up and goes to me to beg for food.

As for his little sister? She's... Pretty. Yeah, well go for that."
