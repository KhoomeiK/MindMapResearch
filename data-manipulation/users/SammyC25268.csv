Astellia,ffdx67g,t3_esvssf,1579831140.0,"I see some people playing on the North American server.  I saw 10 people in the first city outside of the tutorial.  Some players are walking around in the low level zones.  I thought I read somewhere that most people are in the higher level zones.  Global chat is kinda active.  I've heard reports of people waiting forever for a dungeon queue though.

game is decent.  Nice graphics.  colors are bright and not dull.  Older computers can play this game just fine.  Some people think the graphics look a bit dated but I don't think the graphics are that bad.  Early game has some tiny plot twits but not enough to make the game unbelievable.  I hate games with so many plot twists that I forget what the main story is about.  The story after the tutorial town is a bit confusing but you will continue with the main plot soon.

Without spoiling the story I will say that the the transition between the tutorial and the first city in the ""regular game"" is a bit jarring.  There is no mention of the past story events until you reach the zone next that is after the first city.  Even when your reach the next zone (I forgot the name) you will need to do some quests with gordos and the Astel teachers before you can even start searching for the soldier.

Text translation can be better.  As other people in other threads and even the official forum said: text is plain wrong in some cases.  Some text repeats itself. The voice dialog is decent though.

The process of leveling at least in the early zones is not too slow.  I can't comment any more about the ""grind"".  I will say that my character is able to defeat regular mobs/monsters in the zone without problems.  Quest bosses are challenging even when I have 3 Astels out.  Having 3 Astels summoned does us a lot of Astel energy (I forgot the exact name).

Astel mechanic is interesting and do help battles.  Quests aren't too long and boring.  Just kill 5 monsters, cure 4 corrupt gordos, navigate a small maze without being caught.  I like how the Astels are part of the story.  as I said in another thread: The banter between Rota and Pisces can be funny and serious depending on the situation.  I don't think the game is as bad as most other people say it is.  I rather play this game instead of most Western online games.

I haven't tried crafting anything or enhancing/enchanting equipment either.

Sorry I couldn't help out more but I have only played Astellia during the free weekend during the Christmas/holiday trial."

You should be fine in major populated areas and most major state and interstate highways though.  Exceptions are very rural and remote towns and Alaska - no domestic roaming unless the town has a few thousand people near a highway.  Just make sure to buy a phone with band 71 if you frequently go to rural areas."
crowfall,ffd94ca,t3_esvh12,1579815840.0,"as the other people suggested, wait for the next big patch at the earliest before you buy the game.  If you have a slow or old video card, wait for the developers to optimize the graphics engine.  It is no fun playing at 6 frames per second with a 6 year old video card and 2GB of video memory.  Funny thing is that I can play Second Life and other online games at medium graphics quality.

global chat is somewhat active.  Population is ok with 25 people in God's Reach on the Virginia Server. Most people that I've seen are in the first temple crafting.  I would try to explore the first PVP zone but my character level is too low to enter the zone. There are some big PVP battles but these battles don't occur frequently.  I have only read about one siege.  The only reason I knew about the siege or big PVP battle was occurring is that people saying ""good fight"" in global chat.  I'm not aware of the schedule for sieges because I don't see them.  I guess they happen mostly on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.

i find reception in buildings in outer suburbs and rural areas is bad.  Urban areas have lots of band 41 (2500 MHz) sites on tall buildings.  Phone might have issues in the outer suburbs or rural areas because Sprint doesn't seem to have many towers outside of big cities at least in Northern Virginia.  I guess my phone has issues connecting to band 26 for some reason??  I seem to have better luck with my phone CDMA/EVDO mode.  Of course, I won't get 4G speeds on bands 25 or 41 then.  Ugg!  Sprint's spotty coverage/fluctuating signal strength outside of big cities is the only reason I am staying with T-Mobile.
