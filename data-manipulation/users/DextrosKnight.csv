What I'm saying is that, hypothetically, if people didn't own properties, *someone* would own them, most likely the banks. In that hypothetical situation, the one in which people cannot own properties, in order to live in a house one would pay rent to the bank that owns the house. 

Stepping out of the hypothetical now, if you decide to buy a house, you take out a mortgage on it. What that boils down to is the bank is buying your house for you and then you pay them back for it over the course of ~30 years, so in essence you are renting the house from the bank until it is paid off. This was what my hypothetical situation was referring to. Sorry for the misunderstanding."

Games,fcog2d0,t1_fcod1fr,1577831370.0,"It's not necessarily greed motivating this. Look at FFXIII and XV, or Kingdom Hearts 3; those games each took the better part of a decade to be completed, and while they sold well, I don't think they ever really performed like Square-Enix hoped they would. It doesn't make sense to spend that kind of time developing a game to only make $60 on it. Granted the time spent in development for those games was unusually long and due mostly to exceptionally poor project management, so one would hope they'd have straightened that out for FFVIIR. 

There's basically two ways they could do this: rush it out for a quick nostalgia cash-in and likely piss off long-time fans, or take their time, really flesh things out and make something that will still piss people off, because there's no pleasing ""gamers"", but will hopefully have a mostly positive reception. I know there's some people out there who say all they want is original FFVII with prettier graphics, but those same people would cry so damn much on the internet if they spent $60 in 2020 for a game that feels like a 20 year old experience. Besides, you can already play FFVII with prettier graphics, there's lots of mods for that.

I'm rambling, I know, but the point I'm trying to make here is if all they did was put a fresh coat of paint on an old game, yeah, they could get it done in a couple years and sell it as one game. But they seem to be pretty serious about doing this right, and while waiting potentially years between parts is not something I'm really looking forward to, for now anyway I have some faith that each game will feel like a complete game and give new generations a reason to love FFVII."
