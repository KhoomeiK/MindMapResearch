Probably some wish-fulfillment, stress relief, and some stuff with how it’s an acceptable expression of emotions for men, but that’s at least the main reason I play."

todayilearned,fcj11k3,t3_ehale4,1577674618.0,"Fair enough, I do like that alternative.  I do think that being wrong about something that dramatic and pervasive throughout his teachings does damage his credibility a bit, though it does not destroy it, and there is such a thing as credibility in one domain but not in others.  That being said, I do think that people do discredit the God option a bit out of hand, just as many other spiritual traditions are dismissed for similar reasons.  Not to say that everyone who starts making God claims should be taken seriously, but it can be included as an option.

And no worries, I never perceived that you were trying to argue your personal beliefs."
todayilearned,fciyhnh,t1_fcixu22,1577672867.0,"He very well could be a well-meaning madman.  But that still means he was a madman.  Maybe a great moral teacher too—and I think there are few people who don’t think that overall his moral teachings are profound.  But unless you have some textual evidence to throw out all the God claims, he had to be a madman too.  Or a liar.  Or God.  He could not be ONLY a fully sane, moral teacher.  Lewis doesn’t really argue anything past this theological question, but it is a fair question.  And it still allows for people to accept as a wise, crazy, person, if they do choose."
todayilearned,fciwnki,t1_fcibvw4,1577671597.0,"I think Lewis’ point is that he cannot be JUST (as in only) a great moral teacher.  A lunatic could also have great moral teachings, which you could accept, though it certainly makes him a less credible source for moral teaching.  A liar could too, though again, less credible source for moral teaching.  But if we take all of Jesus’ statements, theological as well as moral, at face value and as actual things that the man said, he cannot JUST be a moral teacher."
