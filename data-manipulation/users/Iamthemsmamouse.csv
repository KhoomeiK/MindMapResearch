Her kindergarten teacher gave her class the California achievement test twice.  Once at the beginning of the year & at the end of the year.  She scored 93% & 98% at the end of year. She was reading at 3 1/2. She's got a AA, BofA in accounting and MBA.) So I think you should be ok.

And congratulations!"
family,ffp2sh2,t3_eucmae,1580085068.0,"Some sweets that she loves, books, craft (IE: cross stitch,  knitting or crochet) to keep her mind occupied.  The longest I've ever been in the hospital is 10 days & I was bored out of mind by day 5-6 (was on a ventilator for the first 4 days) but I did have knitting with me, so between a couple of romance novels, my knitting and old movies channel I didn't jump out the window."
JustNoSO,ffl4zyx,t3_eu2ow0,1580034906.0,"I feel for you.  I remember when Reagan was reelected and my now XH said it was my fault that it happened.  I am a liberal Democrat woman.  No way in heaven or hell would I vote for GOP POS. 

Now having told you this, my youngest daughter (who has bipolar disorder, forced birther) thinks that the sun rises and sets on trump's butt. So I am dealing with it too."

Tacoma,ffk1tij,t3_etzy8z,1580013210.0,Coffee shops are usually good  (I used to go to a MU for knitting at a couple of Starbucks in Seattle)
JUSTNOMIL,ffjyg1h,t3_etvm0f,1580010409.0,"I have 9 grandchildren and I do buy gifts that are meant for just my house (kids are 16,15,12,6,6,5,4,3 and 2. So we keep books, games, puzzles and building things here) the kids share stuff.  There are 3 boys & 6 girls, I got the oldest 16 & 15 (16 is boy & 15 is a girl and they are 10 months apart) these building things when they were 4, his was the boy set, her's girl set. I've added to each set. Right now I've got 9 toy boxes for the kids (my husband built wooden crates and we decorated them with each kiddos name, he's built frames that house them) we have bookcases for puzzles, books (think Brad Meltzer book series for kids, I picked up 3 sets, 1 is at my house and 2 went home with 2 sets of grandkids) games. Arts & craft stuff (husband has built about 6 paracord bracelet frames, 1is mine. But we do crafts at grandma's,  coloring books, markers, crayons--you name it."
quilting,ffjprrt,t1_ffjphx4,1580003876.0,"The reason I asked,  it looked nicely ironed out.  And yes I am the nutjob who irons her quilting fabric before I sew with it. Like I will wash it & hang it up to dry, then iron it out and fold it. Way I was taught by my mom and grandmother to do."
family,ffjonwt,t1_ffjnwfj,1580003126.0,"Just turned 28 when dad passed & almost 38 1/2 when mom passed.  I am the oldest of 2 daughters. Lucky me got stuck dealing with their estate as my sister lived in the midwest and I still lived in the same state as them. No wills, had to be court appointed and dealing with a just no mother-in-law who took glee in interfering with the estate.  Our probate attorney had to fill a restraining order against her because she was harassing myself, sister & him. Nightmare of a time."

family,ffjm6d1,t3_ety4d6,1580001448.0,I'm so sorry for your loss.  Lost both of my parents  (dad 34 years ago and mom 23 years ago)  it does get better slowly.

MrReddit,ffjfbdx,t1_ffjeazg,1579997044.0,"I did it too. I used to be a bus driver and had a passenger complained about me smelling & I was showering in the morning before I came to work. (Was driving a bus with no AC & over 100 degrees in the bus, but the bus company thought I wasn't cleaning myself)"
MrReddit,ffjdz96,t3_etufja,1579996261.0,"Graves patient too. I guess I have a over sensitive nose because I swear to God I shower & still think I smell.  Maybe I right? I was born with Graves and wasn't diagnosed until I was in my 40's. 

I'm sorry you were treated like that"
gardening,ffhanx4,t3_etitu7,1579928073.0,Aloe is great for burns (sun & kitchen type) I used to keep a plant over my sink. We take the plants outside in the summer and back inside in the winter.
