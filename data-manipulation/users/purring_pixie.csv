cats,fdwnlrl,t1_fdwi5lv,1578760545.0,Put armchair on side.  Put cat on armchair.  Take picture.  Rotate picture.  Post on Reddit.  Collect karma. It is the way.
Healthy_Recipes,fdfgp4b,t1_fdeya03,1578361281.0,"I second this!  Everything I've made using Budget Bytes recipes has been amazing,  and she even has meal planning options."
solotravel,fdam5d2,t1_fdal97l,1578247584.0,"I lived in Birmingham, England for a couple years,  so I took multiple trips. There's so much to see and do in the  UK that you could spend as much time as you had and still feel like there's more to do."
solotravel,fcyxaja,t1_fcywb6d,1578089114.0,"Oh, I almost forgot... the hop-on, hop-off tour buses are a great way to see London and hear a lot of interesting stories. A ticket is good for 24 hours,  so I did it in the afternoon the first day and the morning of the next, which worked well.  I also enjoyed touring the Tower of London, where the Crown Jewels are on display and where Anne Boleyn died."
solotravel,fcywb6d,t1_fcyuab8,1578088494.0,"That's a lovely journey!  I traveled solo for most of it myself and truly enjoyed it. Some of my favorites are Edinburgh, the castles in Wales (they're all so different that it's worth going to many of them,  including Harlech, Conwy, and the massive Caernarfon castles), the Jurassic coast in Lyme Regis (where you can find amazing fossils just laying on the rocky shore), Stonehenge, Bath, and the Giant's  Causeway in Northern Ireland (with it's amazing Qbert columns). 

Except when I went to London, I didn't plan ahead at all, but just found bed and breakfasts wherever the wind carried me.  Oh, if you make it to Cornwall,  be sure to get a Cornish pastry there.  If you don't make it to Cornwall,  get a pasty in London or somewhere along the way.  

Speaking of London,  the tube is easy and interesting to ride,  and all the museums in London are free. London is my favorite city in the world,  perhaps tied with Rome. So it's well worth spending some time there, in my opinion. The Rosetta Stone in the British  Museum was cool,  and my favorite board game store was nearby,  although I can't remember its name now. I often saved money on food there by going to Mark's and Spencer's,  a grocery store with a lot of ready made food or getting food from a vendor outside Euston station.

I hope you enjoy your travels as much as I did.  The UK is a wonderful place to explore!"
solotravel,fcxwsrj,t3_ejh4qu,1578071633.0,"I'm American but lived in England for a couple years.  By the time I tried driving,  I had already been living there about 9 months.  I rented a car for a bank holiday weekend and drove all over England,  Scotland,  and Wales by myself.  It was a great trip!  It was stressful at first,  but by the end if it, I was comfortable driving on the left side.  

Tips:
1) it's illegal to undertake (pass on the wrong/ slow side) in some countries. 
2) Reserve an automatic car when you're first learning to drive on the other side of the road. Most cars in Europe are manual transmission, so you have to specifically request an automatic, or at least they were when I was there."
OffGridCabins,fcuuyeo,t1_fctwfpm,1577989055.0,Thank you!!
52weeksofcooking,fcsiygc,t1_fcsitgz,1577917417.0,Thank you!  It looks delicious.  I can't wait to try it myself!
52weeksofcooking,fcs4o2b,t3_eimwnd,1577911414.0,That looks amazing!  How did you make it?
aww,fcs3lfs,t3_eijnbq,1577910962.0,That is so darn wholesome and precious!
OculusQuest,fcp5cl9,t1_fcp534s,1577850972.0,"Best answer EVER. I have spoken. (Wait, this isn't the Mandalorian subreddit. Oh well. That is the way.)"
OffGridCabins,fcp584a,t1_fcp4two,1577850858.0,Very impressive! Thanks for the info and for the encouragement!
OculusQuest,fcp25ot,t1_fcoztvn,1577848167.0,"Mine always says,  ""oops something went wrong."" So either there aren't leaderboards, or I didn't do something right. I don't bother with leaderboards though, so I've never looked into it."
OffGridCabins,fcp1uto,t1_fcp1ql3,1577847903.0,"That's a very interesting idea. Very,  very interesting.  Thank you!"
OffGridCabins,fcov12a,t1_fcoupk4,1577842329.0,"That sounds like little piece of heaven. Thanks for the great ideas and the encouragement, you sound like a very thoughtful person."
OffGridCabins,fcournw,t1_fcothqz,1577842122.0,"I definitely don't want anything as big as 1500 feet.  I don't need that much space. Something small and simple would be perfect for me. I'm sure I can make it happen.  Where there's a will, there's a way!"
OculusQuest,fcops0f,t1_fcojpki,1577838333.0,"Well, I'm female, so not really a man, but I like the sentiment! :)"
OffGridCabins,fcooy9y,t1_fconjk7,1577837726.0,"That book sounds really interesting;  I'll definitely check it out. I want to live off-grid in a forest, but I also want wifi access so I can play in VR on my oculus quest.  So maybe off-grid isn't really feasible? Then again, I guess I don't have to be remote to be off-grid. I'd like to be away from too many people though. Ideally, I would like to have a big garden and a greenhouse in which to grow my own vegetables. But realistically, a small garden would do just fine. No animals though, other than my cats (and maybe a dog or two). Well, maybe a cow for fresh milk, now that I think about it. Of course, I could just go to the store.  That's probably more sensible."
OffGridCabins,fcomzpw,t1_fcom0ls,1577836299.0,"I hear what you're saying, and you're certainly right.  The trouble is that I know so very little about building that searching for the right land is overwhelming.  I just don't know enough to be able to determine if land is buildable, what the limitations of the land are, etc.   I figure I need to gain some basic knowledge, then find land, then go back and learn what I more specifically need to know to build on that location."
OffGridCabins,fcok6gc,t1_fcoju38,1577834284.0,Awesome! Thanks!
OculusQuest,fcoi6jb,t1_fcohc06,1577832820.0,"I highly recommend it! There's a bunch of great videos on how to sideload on YouTube. I use BMBF, which oddly enough, shows up in the TV tab in my Quest.  https://bsaber.com/oculus-quest-custom-songs/"
OffGridCabins,fcog3x1,t1_fcoegjk,1577831399.0,Free and helpful!  It's great to know that the YT approach has actually worked.  Thanks!
OffGridCabins,fcog1w3,t1_fcodf3m,1577831361.0,"Thank you so much for the info and the encouragement!  I was half expecting people to tell me that I am crazy for even dreaming of building my own home, but instead I have received such an outpouring of support.  I am so grateful!"
OculusQuest,fcod3e6,t1_fcoamfb,1577829291.0,Very true!  Also show her how to sideload songs that she likes.  That really improves the game!
OculusQuest,fcoch9y,t3_ehtbss,1577828867.0,Love it!  I have spoken.
OffGridCabins,fcobq3m,t1_fco6uhr,1577828346.0,"Ireland is the most beautiful place in the world!  (Or at least the most beautiful place that I have ever seen.)  Between the wind and all the green, it's just unspeakably gorgeous.  I really hope to go back again someday.  

I have started feeling like I need to hurry up and accomplish things before I start to get old. After all, I'm already 47.  Although I'm in good shape so far and don't feel any different than I did in my 20s, everyone says that it will change. I am very  grateful that you shared your own age and plans.  That is such a reassurance to me, and I really appreciate it.  Good luck to you in your build!"
OffGridCabins,fcoas1t,t1_fco8esb,1577827690.0,"That is so incredibly inspiring!  Thank you so much for sharing!  I had never considered such a home.  So much to consider, and so many happy dreams to have!  Thanks again!"
OffGridCabins,fcoaom5,t1_fcoa514,1577827626.0,Thank you!
OffGridCabins,fco50e9,t1_fco4s13,1577824197.0,That's amazing!  You're really lucky to have such a great opportunity.  I'll look around and see if anything similar is available nearby.
OffGridCabins,fcnz58d,t1_fcnz1m8,1577821215.0,Great idea!  Thanks! I'll check into it.
OffGridCabins,fcnxibj,t1_fcnx6q4,1577820380.0,Perfect! Thanks!  Did you build your home on your own or end up needing help?  How long did it take you to build?
OffGridCabins,fcnwbm5,t1_fcnuajp,1577819739.0,That would be great!  Thanks!
OffGridCabins,fcnwab2,t1_fcnvu12,1577819718.0,I saw that one online. It is actually my top choice at this point because it looks really thorough and a summer trip to Maine sounds fun. Do you by any chance know anyone who has taken the course already?
OffGridCabins,fcnvysy,t1_fcnuyco,1577819527.0,That looks so awesome!  I never even considered mud! I love that it's a female organization!
OffGridCabins,fcnvuz6,t3_ei6x90,1577819464.0,"I'm currently living in Houston.  I'm originally from the midwest and would like to build up north though. Also, I'm a teacher so I have summers off."
OffGridCabins,fcntv6k,t1_fcntpk0,1577818309.0,Thanks!  Were there any books that you found particularly helpful that you could recommend?
OffGridCabins,fcntg4y,t1_fcntcv3,1577818079.0,Great idea! Thanks!

datingoverthirty,fcbyjvp,t1_fcb61eu,1577592398.0,"You're right.. it really works. I'm from Michigan, but I've lived in Texas since just after Ike. I can pull out y'alls and sweeties faster than I can believe when someone is upset or I need something from a top shelf at the grocery store. All spoken with a sweet lil Texan accent of course. The funny thing is that I don't do it on purpose, but it sure happens! And it works!"
RedditForGrownups,fcbecqr,t3_egt0oc,1577585826.0,"Perhaps you should talk it over with your kids and get their input.  I had a chance to move overseas when my son was 12. I was amicably divorced from his father,  so my son could either stay with his dad, come with me,  or veto the whole move.  My son gave my move a thumbs up and stayed with his dad most of the time because he loved his school, but visited me in three UK for long stretches of time. When he was in the US with his dad, we played Guild Wars together online while chatting through Skype. When he was in England with me, we traveled around Europe and had a great time. He's 24 now and still close with both of us. I think letting him choose was important in his case."
datingoverthirty,fat3445,t3_eaido2,1576334195.0,"Your attitude is ideal, in my opinion.  A successful relationship will allow both people to grow and possibly change to the point that they are no longer well-suited for each other.  In that case, leaving with grace and kindness is ideal.  There is no reason to be mean in order to leave.  That worked out well for me since I'm still friends with my ex-husband even though we've been divorced for many years.  I don't interact with him much at all, but when either of us wants a pleasant chat, we can always call on each other.  He's more like a brother to me now who I know I can count on in an emergency or if I'm just really bored and want to talk."
