longisland,fe2s8l6,t1_fe28spz,1578842339.0,"Rather than making an ignorant political statement, I recommend looking at the facts:

1) At the same time the tax code was changed, NYS implemented a NYS Property Relief Credit.  The credit should offset a good portion, if not all of, the increase in your income taxes due to the SALT cap.  Make sure you apply for STAR  and then make sure your school district is in compliance with the state.  The only school district in Suffolk county that did not meet the requirement is Wainscott. 

https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/property/property-tax-relief.htm

2) The new tax code most likely reduced your taxes or didn't change them significantly when you look at the total effect:

   A) The tax rates decreased for the lower brackets.  For example, the first $157,000 of everyone's income is being taxed at a lower rate.  The lower brackets are taxed significantly less now.

B) The standard deduction has nearly doubled.  So you might not be able to itemize your property taxes but your deduction should be close to what they were previously by simply taking the standard deduction. 

C)  There were some additional credits, such as the child tax credit being doubled and a slight increase in the earned income credit.  

D) The tax rate for corporations decreased significantly, to the point where it is competitive on an international level.  While this didn't lower your personal taxes, it gave the overall economy a boost, which resulted in more jobs locally, and therefore more options for workers resulting in higher income for many.

E) It's important to note that since the tax code was changed, withholding amounts were also decreased  (less taxes taken out of paychecks) and as a result, some people didn't see as big of a refund at the end of the year. This should not be confused with paying more taxes.  Look at total taxes paid.

The end result is there is more money in most people's pockets.  If you are seeing less, it's likely not because of Trump or the tax code changes he made."

No, quite the contrary.

You provided some text from the agreement that seemingly support your argument but you omitted the critical details in section Q paragraphs 74-76 that support my statement.  

Inspections are only granted at a few  facilities. Section Q paragraphs 74-76 allow Iran to deny access to other facilities that are suspected to be in violation of this agreement.  Instead of allowing inspections at these other facilities, Iran is permitted to provide some type of alternative at their discretion!

>Wrong. Certain sites are open to inspection 24/7 with a system in place to inspect other sites. And the enforcement is snapping back the sanctions. So you're wrong again.

Only certain sites specified in the agreement are open to inspection but others are not.  The agreement only allows us to request access to other sites  but allows Iran to deny access and provide an unspecified alternative to a site inspection at Iran's discretion.  In other words, Iran will be able to determine their own method to show that they are not in violation.

>Or, conversely, the economy to become a part of the world, with trade, infrastructure and modernization,which would work against the radicalizing powers that are allowed to flourish because of the countries struggles.

That makes absolutely no sense. 

This agreement allows Iran to continue r&d of nuclear energy and facilities used for weapons development as long as they agree not to actually develop the nuclear energy used for weapons for 15 years. They will be able to simply convert their facilities to weapons development at the end of the 15 year waiting period.  Meanwhile we have no means to verify that they are actually waiting 15 years because they are allowed to deny inspections.

More money from lifted sanctions facilitates this effort while there is nothing more than your fantasy to suggest that they won't do it.

Roofing,fd6y5zi,t3_ek234w,1578197172.0,"I'm not a pro or anything but a few things to consider.

1) Someone mentioned the cracked window caulking. While I agree this should be repaired because it can definitely let water in, I'm skeptical that there would be a significant amount of water leaking in unless you had wind blowing rain towards the window.  Does it always leak or only when wind is blowing towards the window?

2) I'm not sure why there is black caulk or tar on the roof peak between the roof and wall, but it appears to be cracked. It also looks like tar over exposed nails/nail pops close to the peak. I'd take a close look at these and reapply tar if necessary to make sure it's sealed.

3) Someone else mentioned that there should be a membrane underneath the shingles and siding between the wall and the roof. This is absolutely correct. Specifications for this can be found on the GAF website.  I recall reading the GAF shingles installation manual when I had my roof done and it specified ice and water shield  and it must go up the wall a certain distance. This is to prevent any water that gets underneath the shingles from getting through your roof underlayment.  I'm not sure if or how you would be able to confirm this though. It's really something that needs to be inspected during installation.

Edit: I just realized on #3 I wrote about the ice and watershield extending underneath the siding, but I'm not sure what's proper for your case with a brick wall. I'm guessing the ice and water shield would be along the entire edge of the roof and flashing similar to a chimney for the entire wall.

How do you know that?  I argue that it most definitely can and most likely did, based on human nature.

 People belonging to the same group influence each other to develop a culture, in this case, consisting of criminal behavior.  They identify with each other through similarity in appearance and/or other common life situations, attributes, and interests.  They develop a bond and influence each other's behavior to varying degrees.  So skin color cannot be ignored.

Recognizing this is part of human nature and survival instinct.  Our brains learn by association for this reason. For example, if this Jewish man ignored the fact that he's been mugged by black people so consistently and continues to put himself in the same situation with his guard down, he's likely to continue getting mugged and possibly hurt or killed in the process.  But because his brain picked up on this association, he's likely to make rational decisions to avoid the danger now.  

You call this racism but I call this survival instinct naturally developed due to real life experiences and associations.  The Jewish man increased his chances of a successful life for him and his family due to his survival instinct."
