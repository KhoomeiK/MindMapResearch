MMORPG,fgt0toh,t1_fgs81db,1581096682.0,"This. While I don't want to think of the total amount of base games+expacs+monthly subs I've put into my MMOs, I've never understood why so many people are vocal about it when 15$ for a month is basically the same price of going to the movies once. 

I don't want to add up the cost of my take-out, coffees or snacks or whatever else either. That's always going to feel like a lot of money regardless of what it is."
unpopularkpopopinions,fgss0qf,t3_f01pi0,1581091427.0,"Idk, they might get more of these sorts of opportunities outside of the main albums, and RM seems to get a lot of attention in MVs + Hobi as a dancer but as a Yoongi stan, I feel like I barely get to see him in newer MVs."
unpopularkpopopinions,fgsrmvo,t3_f06p8p,1581091189.0,"1. Idk about no. 1 but def underrated.
4. Agree.
7. Yeah esp Yuqi. My bias.
8. Noooo.
9. Also big no haha. 

No opinions on the rest since I don't pay as much attention to these members. 

I upvoted you though since I really disagree with 8-9 haha."
unpopularkpopopinions,fgsrfys,t1_fgs5p4u,1581091071.0,Would make it a flair that can be filtered out but I wouldn't ban them altogether since the way the subs work are different with the whole voting for unpopular opinions while rants are just rants and I think fandoms are such an important part of well...Kpop Fandom. Just my two cents though.

It's a really nice thing for a BF to do."
wownoob,fgpihj8,t3_ezrwuv,1581005457.0,"Played a little of WoD and Legion but not that much. I'm pretty casual/completionist and those things, I'm having the most fun since MoP. Not because it's necessarily a better expac (than WoD yes, Legion I don't think so, it's just good timing for me.)

Actually really easy to catch up on gear if you're not a hardcore player imo."
LOONA,fgpb8s7,t3_ezqjp0,1581001215.0,"That was amazing, the only part I'm disappointed about is Vivi didn't even get that ONE close-up of her ONE line, sigh. She's not even my bias but this sucks. 

Otherwise this was so gooood. I hope they get a show win this promotion."
LOONA,fgp9yfl,t1_fgouquh,1581000383.0,"Swore that was Haseul for a sec, I had to count the group shots at the end to make sure it was really the 11 of them..."

Hi mah brother lol."
wownoob,fgk40bd,t1_fgk37if,1580857011.0,"NA-H unfortunately, but thanks for the offer, appreciate it :) I have a friend who will help me when I'm good to play again, which hopefully is sooner than later. I haven't felt like playing this much since MOP and it's a shame I have this wrist/arm pain showing up. Getting old I guess lol."
wow,fgk26wb,t1_fgitkpl,1580855952.0,"This. There's very little ""new blood"" that start this game at this point compared to long-term players who play either consistently or on-and-off. I can't imagine alts not being a big part of player retention. If the metrics show ""players don't play alts as much as their mains"" and they go with that as their logic to make playing alts difficult, that's because playing them is so crappy in the first place...

The lack of understanding of such simple logic wouldn't surprise me from current-days Blizz at this point, though.

Having a different leveling experience for H/A in BFA (it is right? I only did Horde but separate continent and story seems to indicate that, haven't looked into it yet) is a good move, and so was the different class experience from Legion. They should bring both these things back in Shadowlands, but with more alt-friendly mechanics. 

There are other ways to pad up play time, I can't imagine making alts less of a pain isn't one of them. 

But you know, we think we wan't it but we don't, or something :*)"

MMORPG,fgk0do6,t3_eyrl0z,1580854927.0,"-A few games release classic/progression servers

-A few f2p or large successful MMOs are still running, although with much smaller populations, possibly in maintenance mode only (thinking WoW here) 

-Overall even less interest in the genre outside of those niche

-Maybe a couple actually decent, less p2w mobile offerings but nothing that amazing, BIG maybe.

-Possibly a game on Switch that does pretty well, crossing that bridge between PC and mobile MMOs? But it's Nintendo and they suck at online so...I don't know lol.

-Definitely no AAA offerings or anything like that, I think that horse is beaten and long dead

-A couple smaller studios might finally actually manage to cater well to the niche of nostalgic/sandbox and doesn't attract huge masses but does okay for its budget, many abandoned, undelivering crowd-funded/early access failures along the way. MAYBE a victor emerges. Maybe.

-Eve lives on because it's Eve

-MMO players continue complaining about the state of the genre and yearning for days long gone

Edit: Star Citizen is halfway through its development cycle"
