Semenretention,ffyih3z,t1_ffy7oys,1580347209.0,"Thank you so much brother. 
I have a suggestion for you, have you tried the MSM+Vit C+molybdenum combo?? 
Also do you meditate or circulate the energy through exercise or yoga? 
What do you feel is the reason you keep having these WD? 
With the sage, it's called smudging. You light sage on fire, blow it out and ask the universe to carry out your intention to let go of negative energy. Then you use the smoke from the sage to carry out that intention. 
Sage is said to purify energy. 
Palo Santo is a wood you burn with the intention of clearing negative energy and bringing in positive. 
I was skeptical until I used them and like I said my body purged. 
You're probably already doing stuff for this but I have a radical suggestion. What kind of diets have you tried so far? Consider doing the carnivore diet because it will eliminate everything you're possibly sensitive to. Also fasting is very powerful for the skin. My skin has a glow to it and my eyes shine brightly after 2 days water fasting. 

Another thing brother you are not your disease. It doesn't make you a better or worse person. Your looks do not determine what type of person you are. Please learn to love and accept yourself as is, ask the universe to heal your body. I began doing this a few weeks ago and did it consistently before bed after meditating. 
I believe we need to meditate atleast some to manifest our prayers. 
Self hacked is a good website that may provide more information for you about psoriasis. 
Hope that helps brother!"
Semenretention,ffx9fmv,t3_evpotb,1580320514.0,"You picked a good time to ask! 
I'm at day 28, this is my 3rd streak. Last 2 were 21 and 28 days respectively, just so you get the idea these benefits are cumulative. 
I'm more flexible, like A LOT more flexible. I normally struggle with body pain and I have fibromyalgia (holy shit, come to think of it, meditation amf letting go of my negative emotions is healing my fibromyalgia ahhhh I'm so excited right now. Theory is fibromyalgia is caused by holding in negative emotions Thank God ahh your post just helped me so thanks!) anyways, yeah my body doesn't hurt near as much. I'm going to the gym 4 days a week for weights and doing yoga on the day's I don't lift. It's good for transmuting this energy! 
I'm stronger, my weight has stayed the same but I'm so much more muscular. 
I used to have knee pain, back pain, all sorts of pain. But i truly believe that deep breathing, experiencing my negative emotions instead of putting them into my body, yoga, healthy diet, and meditation to purify old emotions is healing my fibromyalgia which I've had for the last 8 years. Ahh the sun just shined on my face as I wrote this. Thank you God! 
Hahaha!
Edit: im literally about to cry. Thank you guys sooo much. I've been in constant pain since I was 16. Some days unable to leave my bed, at one point I slept for days in a row without getting up. I used to be hooked to pain pills. Hooked to so many different drugs to run from my emotions. 
But through SR and the knowledge everyone reading this has shared with me I am so grateful to say i am finally being healed thanks to you guys and the power of the universe. (Sun shines on my face again not kidding) 
Thank you Soo much. 
I literally don't even know what I'm gonna do with my life now, I spent so much time avoiding things because I hurt too badly. 
Wow.. 
Thanks for reading. I just had to share this amazing moment with everyone. Trust in tjhe universe and God.. 
Thank you.."
Semenretention,ffx78xm,t1_ffw0nck,1580319215.0,"Have you had a Kundalini awakening? Have you talked to others that have? 
There's a reason why I say these things. Just because they don't fit in your paradigm doesn't mean they aren't valid. Perhaps you'd do better to understand why I say this.
Because I have had a Kundalini awakening. And afterwards I wanted to kill myself and I couldn't even bear to be around my family. I could feel everyone's pain simultaneously. I had an ego death. I lost my friends. 
Do you understand why I say this? 
To someone cruising through a SR subreddit enjoying the Kundalini energy flowing through their body, they hear it's a powerful force and life changing, naturally their interest is peaked, but then we hear the warnings and our ego rationalizes that this person must be gatekeeping or perhaps think ""I can handle it"" or we just flat out ignore it. 
This is not stuff to take lightly.
I say this not to discourage the commenter from spiritual practices but to hopefully save them from going through what many including myself and others had to go through. I prepared for years and I wasn't ready either. But, like I said, this experience has proved to be valuable and life changing. But going through it is like literally hell."
Semenretention,ffx5ef9,t1_ffwtfom,1580318114.0,"Funny you asked, 28 days ago I set a goal that I was to do Ayahuasca with 30 days of retention in order to let go of all of the negativity I've held in for years and cleanse myself of spiritual parasites. 

Then I discovered sage, and the night I smudged myself I ended up purging repeatedly, each time I felt lighter and no longer feel evil in my own thoughts. Retention also guards one from lower vibe energies, I believe and have experienced this, but it also happens because I asked for it to happen. 

My view on Ayahuasca is that it is a transforming drug for people that are ready. It is good for purging. I personally have not experienced a DMT trip, I have taken Ayahuasca but never got much out of it besides purging. 
My view on psychedelics is that they will lead you to truths you can reach on your own through meditation and communication with your higher self and the universe. But also I believe they do have a place in some people's lives, it might be the catalyst to change someone's entire life especially if they haven't been spiritual before or have identified with their ego or an identity that doesn't fulfill them. 
DMT is like a rocketship to truth. It can be too much for some people.
One thing I did experience after doing Ayahuasca even though I didn't trip much, was for weeks afterwards I was less depressed and I had mother Maya giving me compassionate insights, and reminded me to do the things that were best for me and others. It sounds simple but we often don't think in the best interests of people including ourselves due to ego, emotions, etc."
Semenretention,ffvwrf6,t1_ffvt51q,1580275631.0,"You aren't ready for a Kundalini awakening. Yogi's that home their bodies and minds for years have trouble with Kundalini. 
Trust me, you don't want to have a Kundalini awakening. But if you do, it'll change your life and everything you thought you are will change. In the end it makes you better and stronger and puts you on the right path for you but it's hell getting there. 
For now, just trust in the powers of the universe and God and you will have everything you need at the right time. Trust."
Semenretention,ffundvk,t1_ffudgz2,1580245610.0,"That's so good to hear man. You're purifying your energy and letting go of trauma, basically pent up emotions. 
When we have these pent up emotions it just makes life feel so much more complicated than it needs to be."
NoFap,ffu3sbi,t3_ev48xe,1580233871.0,"As you progress in streaks, trauma comes up forcing you to address the parts of yourself making you weak, you have more energy to focus on healthier habits, you get more pleasure from the simple joy of being alive and want to share that with others, you feel smarter which boosts your confidence, as a result your social status rises very quickly forcing you to become the man you've always wanted to be. 
Therefore you will become a man that is automatically attractive to women through his behaviors. 
Not saying looks dont matter, they do. 
But really, the further you go, the more you see women as not the true goal you're looking for. As a result you take them off the pedestal thus making you more attractive then women treat you better and you begin to see yourself as attractive. Overtime the man you thought you were and your reasons for retaining have shifted. 

This praxrice needs meditation and spirituality with it. Otherwise you just have more energy. If your life sucks it's probably gonna temporarily suck more."
Semenretention,ffsoz80,t3_euxviu,1580187542.0,"Keep going, the benefits get better. Even if you're not great at first, with practice you will become better. 
It's unrealistic to expect yourself to be great at something without significant practice. 
The good thing is practicing a skill like a sport takes great discipline and dedication which is something you'll need throughout life because there will be times you want to quit but you'll hang in there because you know the game isn't over. Plus the comaraderie (yeah I cant spell that word) is so important. 
Give it a try man!"
Semenretention,ffsn4of,t1_ffsb03r,1580185977.0,"You misunderstand. You're also God. Like i said, I'm aware my words would be misinterpreted. I'm aware of how crazy it sounds. 
Ask anyone who's had the experience of knowing they are God/infinity/everything is love/we are all one. They'll all tell you the same thing, it's impossibly convincing and impossible to ignore. 

You're paying attention to the words and the meaning behind them. What I'm saying goes beyond words. If I had the words to express to you I would. Words are simply sign posts to meaning, what I am discussing has no proof, it can not be conceptually understood, it must be experienced. 
With that I say, meditate, try the neti neti method and realize that your personality is made up by your past experiences and your interpretation of those events compounded together to form an identity. But this identity doesn't actually exist, it's simply a concept. 
In order for you to experience God you need to go beyond everything you've been taught, you need to go beyond your identity, beyond your preconceptions. 
If this sounds bonkers to you, conceptually it is. I have no stake in the horse race to prove myself to you I simply wish that you could understand what I am saying so you could experience it as well. 
If you did, everything you thought you knew would change."
Semenretention,ffs4klw,t1_ffrmx68,1580172978.0,"Looking at your post history I haven't seen where you've done anything other than condemn and judge other people. If you had an argument or any factual information to share instead of a pointless comment I'd be happy to discuss why I've reached my points.
Judge not, yest ye be judged."
Semenretention,ffr6uug,t1_ffr2ob2,1580151729.0,"Wow man, I had no idea you were going through that. That sounds tough. I also know what you mean on a lesser scale. My dad notices when I'm down and serious and tries to tease me when I'm in flatline. 
It sounds tough what you're going through. My mom also told me I'm not allowed to be mad at her, therefore throughout my life I always hold my anger in but its unhealthy and I cant express my anger in a measured way, but I'll get there! 
They sound like they might be quite neurotic, it's tough to live life like that. Always holding back. Remember to take it easy on them too, because they do it because their parents taught them that way.
My advice to you, your emotions are going to get pretty strong on this journey. They will teach you things about yourself and others. You have to learn how to read your emotions well too since emotions strongly distort our perceptions. It takes practice. In this time it would be HUGELY beneficial for you to go to your notepad on your phone or a blank text box and literally just vent into that keypad man. Let it all out, don't judge yourself for it. 
After you burn some nice holes in your screen from the frantic taps, you will feel much better man. 
SR forces you to deal with these strong emotions, and they tell you different things. For example anger tells you that your boundaries are being crossed. Sadness tells you that you have lost something or something is missing. 

Hope that helps my friend. Try getting some more sun, exercise, and meditation. Friends you can be honest with about this stuff will also be beneficial. 


See the thing is your comment helped me too, because I'm trying to be less judgemental of people, and the thing is I tend to scoff at the fronts people put on. Seeing someone not afraid to admit they feel this way and their family teases them makes me feel better too in a way. 
Hope you catch my drift. I'm still trying to understand how to represent myself in a better light."
Semenretention,ffr5rte,t1_ffnjbzr,1580151064.0,"Wonderful assessment. Funny, i noticed i do the same thing. It's like a cycle. I'm a fun person to be around for 2 days then I get overconfident in myself and my ego gets in the way, then my status goes down, then I have to climb my way back up."
Semenretention,ffr0an2,t1_ffqzukk,1580147637.0,"You're right.. I have a tendency to do this I've noticed. Gotta get me, myself, and i all on the same page. 
SR really is forcing me to get my act together. The universe is pushing me to achieve my goals, and in order for that to happen I need to address little things like this in order to be prepared when I am successful. 
I notice I do get more judgy on SR. Before I'd just blow it off. I don't want to fall into these ego traps because i know they're a barrier to success. 
Come to think of it maybe these people are helping me to be a better man."
Semenretention,ffqzccr,t1_ffqxyp9,1580147030.0,"Good one. 
Have a nice day."
Semenretention,ffqxr7j,t1_ffqwwn6,1580146027.0,"We could fall into a dogmatic ego fueled discussion or we could acknowledge that were on the same page and that we share love for the same thing, God. And that human interpretations of whatever God may be can not possibly capture the magnitude of what He/It is."
Semenretention,ffqx2jv,t1_ffq8mak,1580145590.0,"That's totally normal. There are a number of things you can do at this point. 
But first it's important to know that the nature of mind and of humans is to want things to be different than they are. In evolutionary biology and in regular life this is a double edged sword. It's why we feel ""never satisfied"" but also why we strive for acheivement, because we want to improve. 
Your thoughts seem to be well put together even when going through strong emotion. That shows a high level of maturity. Whereas my mind is complete chaos but I allow it to be this way and make peace with it. Both are viable strategies, yours is more practical. 
Anyways, so when looking into ""why are things going this way"" this strong emotion arises. Put your attention on that strong emotion and allow it to be. 
You can go further but only if you're comfortable. This is called shadow work, looking past your surface level thoughts. At this point it can get extremely uncomfortable. You may find that you're not as good of a person as you thought to put it mildly. This is a common experience btw. We repress thoughts that we deem unacceptable. I no longer repress thoughts, I just dive in further and ask myself why honestly. If you don't do it patiently and kindly you will start to judge yourself which can lead to self hate. 
When you go further you may find that you are unsatisfied with a personal relationship, maybe you wished someone said sorry to you after they teased you on something you were sensitive to, maybe you expected any sort of outcome and didn't receive it. 

This is a complicated process and takes a lot of self awareness, patience, and self love. I personally don't think it's for everybody. 

For you, I reccomend to start by just being mindful of your thoughts and feelings even as you ask these questions and feel strongly sad. Allow these emotions to happen. Watch them, and they'll pass by. As you go deeper into meditation I think you'll find you either have some trauma, or maybe you're lucky, blessed, have had extremely positive experiences socially, financially, emotionally, spiritually, and have not left past emotions unexpressed or unprocessed. 

Alternatively just allow yourself to watch your emotions and thoughts. Take nothing seriously in your meditations. Your mind will tell itself stories which will feed into itself to create more stories. If you want to learn more about yourself, life, and your relationships, shadow work is the way to go. If you want to go the route of just meditation amd learning to be with unpleasantness, just observe your thoughts and don't take them seriously. 

This is a lot to take in, so I'll leave you with this. 
When you're sad that's when you need to love yourself the most. Give yourself that patience and allow it to be. Only if you want to go further will you, otherwise your mind will block you.

Any questions let me know. 
I've done plenty of shadow work. It's not fun."

Semenretention,ffpo32l,t1_fflbxrq,1580100022.0,"Thank you! I believe as humans too often were fed someone else's narrative and perspective. I live my own narrative, and I want others to know what it feels like to experience the same thing. Besides, spirituality is an individual thing, everyone gives their own meaning to words and that's why I believe it is best if we find our own meaning behind the words, if that makes sense. For example, the word love means sooo much more to me now than it did even a month ago."

Semenretention,ffn8og5,t1_fflo40w,1580063113.0,"Time to connect to spirit ;) my benefits seem to come most strongly when im centered in myself after meditation and have a strong positive intention. They come even stronger the purer my thoughts. People can feel when you have self love and self respect, mix that with grounded confidence and my friend you are unstoppable. The aura you have on SR seems to protect one from negative events and people. Ive encountered when someone that normally would come up to me and bother me walked up to start a conversation with me would get within 3 feet of me and heard him say ""nevermind"" to himself and quickly turned around. As if there were a barrier. 
Because I asked the universe to protect me from negativity.. 

 Also the stronger your connection to God and the better your karma (good deeds or things you say expecting nothing, not even good karma in return) 

So SR will give you fuel but the real magic comes from transmitting this invaluable life force into things. For example I prayed for confidence, to attract positivity, to be unshakeable, and put my intention to be the best version of myself."
Semenretention,ffn5mzp,t1_ffm1cbm,1580062264.0,"According to my quick research, something in your life is out of balance typically involving family or relationships. 
Take angel numbers with a grain of salt. 
Or try this... Meditate for 10 mins and then at the end connect to the universe. Ask that God guides you in your life, clear your 3rd eye chakra, and have the intention that the universe will speak to you through intuition. 
Once you do this, the angel numbers will come consistently. When they do, pay attention to them, find their meaning, then relate them to what you are thinking or doing at the time. 

Oh look, another angel number as I talk about this.. 1010.
Angel Number 1010 indicates that it is a time of personal development, spiritual awakening and enlightenment. Keep your thoughts, focus and intentions on your soul mission and life purpose, and your elevated vibrations will attract abundance and positive energies into your life
As Im thinking about the universe or on this specific vibe which i use to tell you and others about this stuff I often see these angel numbers."
Semenretention,ffn1ruh,t1_ffldccz,1580061072.0,"While I understand where you're coming from and why you're saying it and I do agree with you there. But unless you've had the experience that you are God/infinity/love then whatever I tell you about the insights I gained through that would likely fall on deaf ears, and that's not to insult your intelligence or anything. It truly is an experience beyond anything I thought was possible. 
Basically you come to realize I am you, you are me. We are in our own realities living through different experiences which we are creating based on our thoughts, feelings, actions, basically God's. Not parting seas or anything like that but defining our path. 
The same thing that makes you alive is in me. We are not cut from a different cloth. 
And also keep in mind that with these experiences things completely out of the ordinary manifest. Thoughts turn into reality quickly, which is why I'm careful about the things I say, think and do and am careful not to condemn.. 
Is it good for mental health? Yes, and no. It takes getting used to. Ungrounded it can be extremely harmful. But it also forces you to step up your game mentally, physically, spiritually, and emotionally. 
Do I think I am God in the way that most people reading this are possibly thinking? No. I am not the center of the universe or the thing everybody worships. God is within us all. 
That is why it is up to us to manifest our potential."

Wish you the best of luck on your journey."
Semenretention,ffkku84,t1_ffkjml7,1580024433.0,"There are a number of ways. 
The way that I use is when meditating often I'll have past fears come up or anxious thoughts that come up attached to a strong emotion. 
So the goal then becomes to feel that strong emotion. Just breathing into it and putting your awareness on it. 
First you must atleast not be in a fight or flight mode, better to do it when you're atleast a bit relaxed. 
Then whatever you feel or what happens, just be brave and keep facing your emotions and breathing into them. Don't rush it or try to push them away. They will gradually fade in intensity. 

Some other techniques:

Visualization
Shaking out your body
Yoga (emotions get trapped in the fascia of our muscles so certain poses evoke an emotional response over time you will see that this is natural and okay) 
EMDR 
Tapping (EFT) 

Haven't tried the last 2 myself. Google is your friend"
Semenretention,ffkjeo6,t1_ffkgxyh,1580023750.0,"I've learned various techniques both intuitively and through reading. 
My meditation routine typically goes:
1. Deep breaths inhaling and exhaling while moving and stretching my body and tensing and relaxing. This is talked about in the book ""Where there is Light"" by Yogananda. 
2. Sit down with good posture. Put attention on breath. Observe whatever comes up like emotions. Typically there's stuff from my day or the past few days for me to process. 
3. Experience these emotions and keep returning my attention to the breath. 
4. Focus on the breath, return attention whenever it gets distracted. 

Along the way some common things will happen: 
Waves of energy currents flow through my body and occasionally get stuck in certain places so I put my awareness there and allow it to circulate. It takes about 10 mins for each day of SR for me to ""clear these channels"". The root chakra is often blocked for me so I breathe into the pelvic area. 

Old memories and pain comes up. It can get overwhelming at times, just remember that this too shall pass, and that this is happening for you to purify yourself of these things that no longer serve you. 

After my body feels clear I thank God for being alive, and for the purifying that just happened with deep gratitude. Then I turn that gratitude into love for myself and for the universe. 
Then I ask for God/the universe to have my back throughout the day. 
I see angel numbers and synchronicity consistently. And they're on point. 

This is just my personal practice, it's a lot more intense and complicated than average but I find that it works for me. I encourage to to let yourself be guided and do what feels right for you. Experiment and with time you will find what works. 

The mind illuminated is a great book on meditation. 

Additional information: sunlight will give you more energy, grass will make you feel more grounded than a chair.  If you can, walk barefoot on the grass too. Imagine your negative energy being purified by the sun or that it flows into the earth. 
The possibilities are endless.

My perspective is that what we think, feel, act, and are is what we create. All oppurtunities in life are just experiences to be experienced. And ultimately we create the meaning for our life. In my life I like understanding how reality, energy, people, consciousness, awareness, and the mind works. 
Maybe this is all some divine cosmic experiement. 
Nobody ultimately knows. 
But I do know that you and I are Divine beings (call us Gods, it's all semantics anyways) living in our own realities, with our own lives.

People may look at you but remember it doesn't matter what they're thinking, what matters is what you're doing and the intent behind it. 
Therefore, have positive intent and stay in control of your own reality, your own emotions, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This is the path to becoming the best version of yourself, and the best version of yoirself is too busy acheiving to worry about naysayers. 
Think of how many people hate Steve Jobs. ""Oh he's so cocky"" or whatever. Cool, maybe so, but he did make the most popular gadget in our decade. 
Morale of the story, you have success, you'll have haters. One comes with the other. 
Haters can have some good info but give them no power over you. A hater can tell you things you aren't even aware of yourself. It's good to have an enemy constantly helping you better yourself. With that being said this takes mental discipline to apply the right way.

Ive gone through the process of recognizing that these stories are bullshit before, but my mind keeps telling them to me. It's the same stuff even though I've recognized and proved it wrong.

I moved right after graduating high school to take care of my grandmother. Losing dozens of friends and girls in the process, losing my social skills even over time. Losing many other things..

Semenretention,ff8ayqa,t1_fc6tzht,1579671362.0,"Amazing comment, im very grateful you elaborated on these concepts. 
When you said ""because it conflicts with our Inner Truth"" that really resonated with me because our Inner Truth, who we really are, is love. And knowing that anger is a tool to push us towards action and thinking creatively reframes it for me. 
So for example, I'm at work and I'm angry because other people there are so negative, argue, or are rude, this means that the anger is real because it conflicts with my inner truth. This inner truth to me is that we are all one and this deluded quest many are on thats basically the need to be better than others or to hurt them or bully them is all a consequence of the competitive view of life instead of realizing that we all are love/spirit/life. 
I'm still forming my perception of this, with time so these ideas are somewhat unrefined."

Turns out he's into spirituality, I mentioned my lower chakras were blocked, he said ""you gotta release"". Being that there were people around I said ""no, I'm trying to do the opposite""

Be careful with rhodiola. I used to love it but it put me in a state of Depersonalization and derealization after weeks of consistent use, and now each time i use it I almost always get these side effects now. 
Also rhodiola has a magic to it that will go away, use very sparingly. At most keep it to 3 days a week. Trust me, one day when you really need it, you'll be glad it still works for you. 
Now when I take rhodiola I go manic and then crash after 3 hours then get Depersonalization and derealization.
Of course I'm more succeptible to these side effects than the average person due to my mental health history of ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and the spiritual awakening probably doesn't ""help"" from a clinical perspective.

Could you expand on these other 2 herbs and how they work for you? Have you tried just one of em at a time and how are the effects for you.

When I'm at work sometimes this happens, so I go into the bathroom to do a standing meditation called zhan zhoung for a couple minutes. Helps to release blockages.
