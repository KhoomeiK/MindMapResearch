NintendoSwitch,ff80ckf,t3_ernvhu,1579662700.0,"Not really sure about the overall validity of the post, but I definitely agree with the closing statement. I refuse to ever buy digital if I have the option to get physical. I learned my lesson long ago when I bought Minecraft digital when it was just getting popular on PC and wasn't able to play it ever again when I lost my login during their change of ownership. They were never able to find my account and I didn't buy Minecraft again until it came out physically on the Wii U. People preach about digital being so convenient, among other things, but I think physical is less of a headache overall, as well as being the obvious choice for collectors."
