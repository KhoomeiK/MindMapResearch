FRIEND,ffogz72,t1_ffofcxb,1580077543.0,"Not everyone is an asshole, not everyone pretends to care, some people do care but they can get wrapped up with their own lives and some people are like me (super awkward) so they just dont know how to show it properly. But there are assholes out there, it's just a matter of being careful with who you allow into your life. Something I learned a little while ago."

Depression has gotten alot worse especially with the way things are recently. Alot of people mistake being sad for depression so when they go through a rough patch they think they're depressed when it's just a bad month or so. Not trying to say you're  not, I'm just saying not everyone knows for sure until they seek help. Please dont blame girls its just them ones that are annoying lol."

teenagers,fdiik3h,t3_elkjtb,1578443706.0,"Well you should always shoot your shots especially if you really like that person and want to be with that person BUT an important thing to ask yourself is if they really feel that way, the thing is that if you look for something then you will always be able to find it or make something seem like it SO it's important to know if they are really giving signs or are you just looking for them therefore believing that you are finding them. BUT I'm an 18M still single and no friends so idk if my advise should be taken that seriously xD"
