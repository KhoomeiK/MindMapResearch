ShitMomGroupsSay,fgle2c4,t1_fgkuhyp,1580892969.0,"Yes the king and his leaders but not to make the people free as you're suggesting but to put James I daughter in as the Catholic head of state. What would have been the consequences of this for the common people?
Civil war, most likely. People took their religion quite seriously back then, hence the plot in the first place.

Instead the houses of Parliament stand in one of the most free countries in the world and a fake Guy Burns every year (if you're in the country)

Fair exchange as far as I'm concerned"

They weren't trying to overthrow ""big government"" (whatever the hell that would have meant in the 1600's when most people didn't have the right to vote), they were trying to kill a Protestant head of state to replace him with a Catholic one. They would have kept everything the same but with just their guy (no pun intended), in charge.
