Iamactuallyverybadass,fcsyer5,t1_fcsxn9s,1577928237.0,"You have difficulty with reading comprehension I think lol. The Merchant Marine refers to a group of mariners, plural. Says it very clearly. Anyone referring to an individual person as a ""merchant marine"" is incorrect. Additionally, I work in this industry ðŸ˜‚ How do you even feel confident in your in incorrect opinion here? I guess I don't know why I bother responding to trolls online though. Have a great 2020 <3"
Iamactuallyverybadass,fcsto5u,t1_fcssexy,1577924825.0,"Lol you really are an idiot I guess? Here's the first sentence from the wiki article you are referencing:

""TheÂ United States Merchant MarineÂ refers to either United States civilian mariners, or to U.S. civilian and federally ownedÂ [merchant vessels].""

Do you see where it says mariners? The Merchant Marine is made up of mariners lol. Not that it matters, but I attended the United States Merchant Marine Academy and I've been sailing commercially for more than a decade. You are wrong, homie."
Iamactuallyverybadass,fcsrmx9,t1_fcrw7wh,1577923362.0,"Rofl absolutely incorrect. The Merchant Marine is the industry as a whole, and the individuals within are merchant mariners."
