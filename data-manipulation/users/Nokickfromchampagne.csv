neoliberal,ffxv0v1,t3_evt1tg,1580332965.0,"I'm in college, and a poli sci major, so just know that the people I interact with generally are not representative of real America. I personally am of course neoliberal, and while they may not describe themselves as such, I know a good half dozen or so people all who generally agree with what we believe. 

Funnily enough, most of the people I know who agree with me politically are PoC, and we bonded over our shared frustration listening to succs in our department trash any candidate who actually has a shot of winning. Who'd a thought that a young black man, slightly religious, middle class, and cognisant of the sociological, economic, and political factors that have placed him in the position of society he dwells in is a Biden fan? As a latino dude who used to work with a bunch of immigrants in kitchens, most of us are generally moderate, family-oriented, and simply want the freedom of opportunity. 

We don't want really care about free university because we all went to community college and paid out of pocket. We don't care about M4A because we want access to jobs that provide good healthcare. We don't singularly focused on identity politics because we understand that the best way to overcome historical disenfranchisement is by elevating the community as a whole by giving us the means to create our own success. 

I realize I went on a massive tangent haha, but basically you don't really see other neoliberals because we all got other shit to worry about. We generally just want to live our lives and bring about the change we desire through pragmatic, equitable means. We don't have the ability or desire to go scream about billionaires. Hope that answers your question"

But if the ol’ paper is saying this joe feller is the cat’s pjs, I guess I’ll go along with it.”"
Catholicism,fffql26,t1_fffpszo,1579889654.0,"i'm catholic but i'll try to give a somewhat balanced perspective. Think of it not from a religious point of view, think of it from a legal point of view. If everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, killing a person is a crime. We obviously call it murder. So if life begins at the point of conception, killing the fetus would be murder. I totally get where you're coming from, but I don't think the ""imposing morality"" argument is effective for the above-mentioned reason. If you believe life begins at conception, and that purposefully ending a life without consent is murder, then it follows abortion is murder. I hope this gives a different perspective."

UCSantaBarbara,ffc2qjs,t3_esqopm,1579790077.0,"In my opinion Sierra Madre is the nicest. They have really spacious, modern bathrooms, more so then San Joaquin. Both of them are the newest and have modern appliances, but there is a chance you get put in a triple if you live in San Joaquin, so I’d consider avoiding it. While SJ and SM are the furthest from campus, they are also at the start of the bus line, so you’re all but guaranteed a spot if you want to do that instead of bike. SM in particular since you won’t be by FT. SJ is also the only one of the three that doesn’t have its own parking lot, so if you wanna bring a car, you’d have to park it in a overflow lot about a mile away close to campus.
