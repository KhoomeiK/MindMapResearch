It would be asinine to make a claim that it doesn't affect anyone.  As I pointed out in an earlier comment, everyone's body can be affected differently from different substances.  

BTW, I am liking the study you linked.  Good find.

AskReddit,ffut2e1,t1_ffurm46,1580248810.0,"I am not going to say it doesn't cause issues.  Everyone's bodies respond differently to different substances.  I mean, I could make the argument that pollen is absolutely terrible for you because it causes congestion, and makes me miserable.  But you on the other hand may not have any issues with it.  Every study I have ran into on aspartame (in regards to cancer), is that there is no correlation. 

In fairness also, and this is what makes me chuckle a bit, is most of the time when people go off about me drinking diet drinks, or using artificial sweeteners, I am generally using Stevia.  But to them, it is all the same.  I probably spoke a little too aggressive before about challenging everyone who brings it up, anymore, I just tell people that I would rather avoid drinking or eating empty calories than worry about ""insert their concern here""."
