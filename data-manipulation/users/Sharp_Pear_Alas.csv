AmItheAsshole,ffdb80h,t3_estdfm,1579817131.0," NTA. This is literally what every therapist says is the right thing to do. In your SO’s defense, it might have created feelings of being ignored.  You two can develop the habit of separating when overheated in an argument, and coming back to the issue when calm has returned. It’s also good to promise each other that if you take a calm time out, that part of your thinking about the issue will include trying to consider the other person’s point of view."
AmItheAsshole,ffd2ia3,t3_estxok,1579812130.0,"Obvious NTA. That being said, stop talking to your mom about decisions like this. Not sure why you would even run it by her? Just take him off the plan, problem solved."
AmItheAsshole,ffc1b6r,t3_espjiy,1579789014.0,"NTA. Does your mom have much in her life that gives her meaning? Because it seems like she is being super dependent on her children to provide that meaning for her. Also, if OP did have a kid, it seems like there might be big boundary issues for OP and the wife to deal with involving 'grandma', considering she thinks she is owed a baby."

These two women seem to think that you adopted these kids like they were accessories, but more than anything they are betraying their own biases. And now you know what kind of person they think you are..."
AmItheAsshole,ffbxdt4,t3_eshzue,1579785847.0,"Gonna add a YTA. It will be hard in the future to be able to go to your big sis looking for sympathy with your problems, as you have not given her any sympathy with hers."
AmItheAsshole,ffbvljx,t3_esle02,1579784242.0,"Huh, thought the whole point of AITA is to judge? I’m just giving my impression.  If it gets everyone’s panties in a bind then maybe don’t visit the sections where people are asked to be judged if they acted like assholes or not."
AmItheAsshole,ffb4gv8,t3_esle02,1579751549.0,"I respectfully disagree. She made the decision to change her name as his wife. Would she have changed it back if he remained alive? If I were his family I would see this as quite an insult. Honestly, her actions don’t portray a close bond with her husband."
AmItheAsshole,ffb2nzu,t1_ffaq539,1579750258.0,$$20k  is NOTHING to try and save your sibling’s life. WTF? What in your life might you spend $20k on? How about you sacrifice that thing or vacation so you can have your brother around?
aww,ffb1zth,t3_eslg46,1579749788.0,Bean is so purdy
AmItheAsshole,ffb1o5b,t3_esle02,1579749566.0,I’m honestly having a hard time understanding exactly why you would change your name back. You had committed to his name. I don’t see how him dying changes that? I would be upset if I was his fam too. It kind of seems like you are erasing him from your life in doing that. Hmm.
