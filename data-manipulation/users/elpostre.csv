There was an info-graphic here a couple of days ago, rescued from a survey from 2016. Also, putting facts aside, I am also speaking empirically. But maybe your experience is different, if you don’t factor in that more following means more of everything in proportion. I am glad every day that she lost, we Mexicans don’t mind Trump much, and now people are not going to go back to the status quo and are deeply involved in politics. The environment is my priority overall.

I spent 7 years in relative isolation, one year I didn’t go out at all. It took years, but now I’m stronger than ever. It would be easier with a professional, but the keys are self-forgiveness, and even though it is horrible, self-love. I now love myself, it’s so strange!"

One day he went to school and he literally had a bit of a cockroach on his shoulder. High School students are young and stupid and cruel, and it’s shameful to tell you you are a school shooter just because of your looks. But the likelihood of shootings causes anxiety on people, and that can be exploited for humor, so don’t take it personal.

Latino is neutral already, or they could have used some native neutral word at least, but Latinx can be read as ‘Latino,’ ‘Latin-h,’ ‘Latinks,’ ‘Latin-equis,’ etc, because the X has many sounds in Spanish but not ‘ex.’ I love trans people but Spanish is gender neutral already if you use neutral pronouns.

I had no self-esteem, and perfectionism and procrastination ruled my life. There was a catalyst that made me recognise that I needed to fix that, and finally made self-forgiveness and self-love functional tools with which I little by little improved what fate, childhood, sickness, sadness and tragedy had warped. I now love myself. In the beginning of the decade I couldn’t sleep if everyone else was sleeping, riddled with fears and imaginings. Today I sleep like a log. I have survived so many things; I am strong. I can survive rejection. I got my crush number yesterday. You just wait."

Childhood can make or destroy a person and leave many scars in your mind and soul, but it’s not your fault. Now you can start to make decisions and mistakes and live your life, please, wait. You have already survived things that have obliterated other people, if you make it through you would be invincible, boy.

I donate to Bernie and a little bit to Warren monthly, and I think is not productive to whack Sanders now instead of going on tandem against the centrists. I still would vote for Warren, but I rather not elect another GOP-lite if they don’t make it. At least Trump makes people political."

depression,fdaoix8,t3_ekfkao,1578248442.0,"Music is actually very powerful for me, either to sink or come afloat with my mood. I sometimes keep mindsets and particular feelings stored inside the songs I was listening at the time, and thus I have a library of times I can come up to if I need to feel the good or the bad times. ‘Budapest’ was my jam when I was suicidal in 2014, ‘Electricity,’ ‘Help our souls,’ ‘Light it up,’ and ‘You’re gonna go far kid,’ are good to lift my mood. I cried for 5 hours last Christmas starting 2:40 listening to IZ’s ‘Over The Rainbow’ and I managed to think through my tears about what I can change this year, and I’m better than ever.

It’s a lie of the heart that there’s nothing left to be done, that you are not strong enough to make it, to change or better yourself. Whatever really motivates you (and even in the darkest times there’s a faint glimmer of light) focus on that, be it family or friends or pets or funny times, and you can hold on to weather the storm and maybe fix some things. I’ll see you in a year, I will be stronger and able to help more then, and we’ll see. Please, picture how you would help a friend you loved to make it out of it, look at you with that love, as bad and battered as you feel, loving you for all you hate, and if you practice that appreciation for you, and forgive yourself when something goes south, you would gather the will to help yourself.

depression,fcn0gl6,t1_fcmgs27,1577799630.0,"I am basically afraid of everything, and I have isolated myself for 7 years. One year I didn’t go out of the house, and almost went insane. I have many projects and things that I would procrastinate in because of perfectionism and lack of motivation. I became a shadow of a shadow, a ghost, wanting to be invisible. But year by year things changed. All my fears came to pass and I was still there, and I had less doubt because people liked me even though I didn’t myself. I went from seeing a horror in the mirror, to a battle-worn boy who had a difficult childhood and survived (it was mostly being sick and having night terrors). Now that I’m writing this, at the beginning of the decade I couldn’t sleep if everyone in the house was already sleeping, some days I would skip a day or go early. Now I sleep like a baby. Time and life eroded my depression little by little. I tried to pursue love once, for example, but I sabotaged myself again, like I always did when someone was interested in me, and I suffered, but I realised I was still there, like with all my crushes. I read so many articles and pinpointed that to fix my self-esteem I had to practice self-forgiveness, and my doubt and fear abated even more. I started to do things, if I wanted to bake, I did. Everyone loved my cakes at work and house. Granted I have always had incondicional love from family and some friends, but those friends I would see yearly, having made no friends near my location. This year a girl again tried to flirt with me, and I found myself trying to flirt back automatically, but then I tried to give her my number and went mute, comically. I couldn’t see what she saw on me. She got a boyfriend because I was basically a mime when she was near, it was a sitcom situation. I couldn’t talk to people I liked, it was like doing some surgery without medical training, terrifying. Many other things happened and this Christmas I woke up at 2:40 the morning and spent 5 hours crying listening to IZ cover of ‘Somewhere Over The Rainbow’ thinking, and only straightening up in bed so my tears wouldn’t ruin my headphones from time to time. I realised I had also an avoidance thing, and that voicing my thoughts I believed I was not strong enough to survive rejection, or take care of people. But I was, I found out that if I accepted I was as strong as I could be and that I can survive most things fear would disappear, I gave my inner self a shield, I could take whatever came to pass, I would fight to the death. I embraced solitude so I could be close to people, because I was no longer afraid of exposing my soft parts like a dragon without some gems in the chest, go ahead and destroy me, I can take it. And I became confident again like when I was a little boy, and I can talk and flirt (wow) and compliment people and help them and love them. Fortune assists the bold, and I was bold again. I have high hopes for 2020, and I will not lower my guard with my self. I actually finally love myself, and if I want something I’ll take it."

Would you leave everyone behind without your help because you don’t see yourself with the eyes of those who love you? It’s only when I don’t love myself that I’m selfish and only think of my suffering, and I’m the more selfless when I shoulder everyone’s burdens with mine so they are happy.

If someone is watching a reality TV show that is not from Discovery or something(granted I am not keen on reality tv), I argue and trash-talk it till they change the channel. I hate bad TV, too. I spend 20 min browsing for something worthy on Netflix every time the family wants to watch something together. But I love arguing, and if it weren’t for me fighting my sister to the death when any of us feel bad, I would argue with people at work, or start confrontations. I am a teddy bear because I get all my fighting out when it’s not completely unhealthy. My Grandma frequently destroys people a la Maggie Smith, and you need to have that crushing spirit when someone threatens your family or is behaving badly with you.

Some things are more cultural, like suicide, for a Mexican it sounds unnecessary and unheard of, but a Japanese will take his life much more easily, while we are more family and death driven, and it’s not honorable or sad to do it, but annoying. Some things are cultural, some not.
