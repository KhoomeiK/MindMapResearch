JUSTNOMIL,fel88xv,t1_fel5nup,1579216194.0,GagHag is actually JNGMIL. See edit on bottom of post.
JUSTNOMIL,fel7k4n,t1_fel4tgd,1579215760.0,"I think I backed her into a corner, so to speak. She can basically get me to calm down and think more clearly when it comes to other aggravations, but I won't budge on a couple subjects, GagHag being the main one. She won't budge either, because her brain works the exact opposite of mine.

I am introverted; I generally dislike people and hate being in crowds. I have a negative outlook on things and am a pessimist 99%  of the time. I take backstabbing and betrayal very seriously, and that includes betrayal from family. I've went NC with both sides of my family at one point because of that.

My Wife is less, but still, introverted. She's very close to immediate family and even  in sure situations is just trying to keep the peace. She's genuinely always positive and the only time she has ever went no contact with somebody is her own parents right after high school due to your typical teenage rebelliousness. 

My JNGMIL, GagHag, is not an exception. Despite everything she's put everyone through, my wife just thinks that all should be forgiven and to make the best of it."

Next, I'm sorry for what you had to go through. But as a human being, I'm very happy you are alive and well (for the most part), today. You have more than proven you are a strong and capable person. 

I get the same way you do. I have people in my life that make me angry like that. Constantly. My GMIL is one of them. I recently got another one fired. Not my best moment, but better than going to jail or a nuthouse. 

If you would like to talk privately, feel free to message. I can try and help with the anger, but it could take time. 

I promise I'm not a creeper. The ""Angry"" in ""AngryGlutton"" is there for a reason."
JUSTNOMIL,fdm6drr,t3_em3rgr,1578540903.0,"Clearly things are not working out with your Mom. I too was the eldest out of 7 kids, and chores were part of the gig, fair or not. I can't help you there.

That being said, yeah, your Mom sounds insufferable and I can relate. I'm sorry you have to go through that.

My own Mother played that card on me once; would you rather live with Dad. And yeah, I told her I did. Yeah, she got pissed. Nope, never lived with him as a kid. That being said, I could have told my dad I wanted to live with him or conveyed to the courts somehow that you would rather live with Dad.

If you do want to live with Dad, be open and thoughtful about it. And be 100% certain about it. Making a decision based on hurt and anger can escalate things. As rough as it is, take the time to weigh the pros and cons. Think on it and be serious. 

You are 15 and you are her kid and are under her roof. Same if you were at Dad's. Chances are you'd have chores still. Maybe talk to Dad about IF you were to live with him what the rules and expectations are.

I'm sorry you have to deal with what she's projecting at you. But do not give her the satisfaction of pissing you off. An angry you is easier to manipulate and control. Be calm, but firm, because IF the courts do become involved, she can use your angst and anger against you."

This is all her tactic. It's all about her! You want your Mom? Clearly all she wants from you is your dignity, sanity and attention. You are not her priority.

SHE IS NOT YOUR PRIORITY, EITHER! 

Right now, YOU are your own priority! You come first! Your mental health is your priority! Your priority is YOU!

She won't listen? She makes it worse? She will never cave to you despite caving to her? Cut her out.

Seriously, it doesn't have to be permanent. It doesn't have to be long. Just long enough. Block her on your phone, social media, emails. Make a NC Goal: 3-weeks, 6months... whatever, and keep it that way! Stick to it! You are responsible for your safety and health and happiness. Right now, she's responsible for the exact opposite."

I'm sorry that you had to go through all that, and that you're going through what you need to now. I've been there and done that, but only during my childhood. I'm actually no contact with my mom because of all the s*** she put me through.

Hang in there, talk to you and listen to your therapist, and try not to give your mother too much and info at the moment. Even if you do feel like calling her, just tell her you don't feel like giving her information as that hasn't worked out well in the past. If she wants to help you, then just tell her to give you space."
JUSTNOMIL,fdlv7pc,t3_em1pze,1578533273.0,"It was probably a blessing in disguise that they didn't show up. Looking at your past posts, your mother-in-law sounds like a complete and total Bitchfest.

Play honestly I would keep notes of all of things that your in-laws, mainly your mother-in-law, are doing / not doing. at some point or another your mother-in-law is going to try and take control of stuff. Seeing as though she once gave her sick grandkid milk specifically when she was told not to oh, it suffice it to say that if she would show up to the wedding or trying to take control of any other situations, that she would do the same thing. That way, you can actually list all of the things to her face that she is done / not done and you can tell her that she is not going to control any aspect of your marriage, your home, your kids, etc etc.

JUSTNOMIL,fdltpga,t3_em23jc,1578532260.0,"How exactly are they controlling, manipulative and such? Are you able to give examples? Did they only do this during your childhood or does it continue into adulthood?

Without some context, it does sound like your mother may be legitimately upset about what you're going through with therapy and how they treated you in such. But then again, she could also just be using the Crying Guiltrip Technique.

This is definitely something that you should bring up to your therapist. They might have a better idea of why she reacted the way she did and where to go from there. Personally, I would just wait and see if she has any other reactions; calls you obsessively to try and reconnect, won't take no for an answer, continued guilt-tripping, reason of the voice, etc etc.

If she does give you your space, maybe after like a couple weeks to a couple months or longer, talk to your therapist and see if there's a possibility that they think she might be coming around.

But until then, yes! Work on you."

JUSTNOMIL,fd3xk05,t3_ejzfso,1578162489.0,"There was a post earlier on this sub about some JNMIL who, despite knowing full well that her grandbaby was deathly allergic to oranges, tried to feed her a Clementine.

Grandbaby said no, she's allergic. JNMIL tried to force it, opens the clementine and grandbaby screams bloody murder and ends up at the ER.

Eventually, JNMIL admitted it was because she didn't see her grandbaby and son enough. I think charged were filed.

Advice? Threaten MIL/FIL with Child Endangerment Charges. Remind them the seriousness of the allergy.

And tell your SO to step-ups or join in the charges, because he's being ingorant at this point, too."
JUSTNOMIL,fczd00w,t3_ejoje1,1578098455.0,"What is it exactly that you're going to college for? Does your mom support you in this decision? She is aware that you are legally an adult, correct?

It always shocks me how the older generation seem to think that we do not turn into adults. I don't know why they're stuck on us being ""kids"".

If that's how your mom is treating you just being back for a little bit from college, then you definitely need to consider finding someplace else after college is over. It doesn't matter if it's your own place, staying somewhere with a friend or another family member, or even just taking a extended vacation somewhere.

It might be a good idea to talk to your mother about this, not just as a fair warning as a consequence to her behavior, but also the judge see how she reacts to news that you're actually considering moving away from her. How she reacts will be an indication of what's to come in the future. 

I think that the reason that parents get upset with their adult children is because they're adults now. We fight back now, we make our own decisions, we have relations with other adults and we need to be independent. If she can't accept that, cut her out and move on."

since she was a friend of mine, I got to talk to her about it about a week after the shower. She had talked to her mother and apparently the mother thought it was a great gift because it would lead to GRANDBABIES.

It's been about seven years since then, and they have purposely not had children just to spite this woman. They do however have three cats, a dog, a room that acts as an aquarium and a Roomba.
