dataisbeautiful,ffjvv26,t1_ffj1d0x,1580008367.0,Check out Cunninglinguists. They rank #2 behind Aesop of most unique words. Someone actually did a study and these 2 were in a league of their own. RA the Rugged Man is a masterclass of talent as well.
dataisbeautiful,ffjvlss,t1_ffir25z,1580008170.0,"You got 10 years on me but I agree with everything you said. I'm blasting 36 Chambers and Liquid Swords constantly. I cant stand this trap garbage that's all auto tuned.

The newer Boom Bap isn't bad, it's just so underground that you wouldn't have a way to find these artists unless your on a Pandora station. 

If your looking for lyricism, cunninglinguists and Aesop Rock always take the cake as far as unique words go. 

More newer artists you might like are; classified, common market, grouch,RA the Rugged man (not new but a beast), gift of gab, soulcrate music, windchill, to name a few."
