All that needs to be settled is how the phone informs the bank of where it is.

If the bank knows where the cell towers are, and the app updates the bank each time it changes towers—the phone knows this— then the bank's info is current enough to know your phone is where your card is, and they can approve the transaction, or deny if not.

The carrier is not required to intervene, not required to hand off your data, the bank doesn't need any of your info from the carrier. What it needs, its getting from you directly via the app."

NoStupidQuestions,ffyax77,t1_ffy0gc2,1580342096.0,"> I believe our current calendar system is based on the Gregorian calendar. Came out of Europe

The latest _revision_ came out of europe, but its ancestry is babylonian with roman alteration.

The Gregorian calendar wasn't a ""new"" calendar, just an edit to the math behind when leap days need to happen.  Plus a 2 week offset to get us back on the correct day.  Basically a hotfix rather than a major release.

The julian calendar itself was merely an alteration of the Roman calendar to fix a few things - mostly irregular year lengths.  Added 10 days getting us to 365, 2 of those to january, sextilis(august), and december, one extra given to april, june, september, and november.  Februrary stayed as it was, 28 days.  Our month lengths now are as they made it then.  They later renamed a few months completing the set we know today.

Our month names and _static_ lengths?  Romans.

Leap Years?  Romans.

The 7-day week we use?  Babylonian.

The numerals written on the calendars? Hindu-Arabic.

DarwinAwards,ff5i57r,t1_ff5gw97,1579593948.0,"Children are not, and have never been a disqualifier.

[To quote the original:](https://darwinawards.com/rules/rules1.html)
>**The existence of offspring, though potentially deleterious to the gene pool, does not disqualify a nominee**. Children inherit only half of each parent's genetic material and thus have their own chance to survive or snuff themselves. If, for instance, the offspring has inherited the ""Play With Combustibles"" gene, but also has inherited the ""Use Caution When..."" gene, then she is a potential innovator and asset to the human race. **Therefore, each nominee is judged based on whether or not she has removed her own genes, without consideration to the number of offspring** or, in the case of an elderly winner, the likelihood of producing more offspring.

There is no way for him to know prior, only by falling can he learn it, given the lack of instrumentation, obvious lack of safety factor in load bearing, lack of redundant safety.
