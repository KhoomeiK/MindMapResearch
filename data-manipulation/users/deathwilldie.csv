My first question would be how do they account for the severity of methane as a GHG vs CO2. Is there a standard calculation that makes it possible to compare the two? I honestly know next to nothing on how emissions are studied so I cant really make a fair judgment on what thier methods are. Overall though a 2.6% reduction in emissions seems pretty good in my books, though it seems it would come with some drawbacks, but those drawbacks don't seem insurmountable."
