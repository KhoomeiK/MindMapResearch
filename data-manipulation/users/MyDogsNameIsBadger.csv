MadeMeSmile,ffpnzd0,t1_ffpcwdc,1580099938.0,"Absolutely. I’ve been working with kids for 15 years and sometimes I am blown away with how smart some kids are. I’ve learned so much from many of them.

For example- I was with a 9 year old and I was complaining that everything was sticking to my sweater. 
Her: “That’s because you’re wearing a reverse ridge stitch pattern”. 
Me: “oh”

This was right after she finished like a 50 piece origami dragon. 

Kids are smart."

wholesomememes,ffib09f,t1_ffiam6l,1579969576.0,"You’re not seeing the point. You’re talking about a method of teaching that has a greater effect on a a student’s ability to learn that pertains to the subject. This is different than someone in front of you watching a movie. You’re not seeing that it DISTRACTS THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU AND AFFECTS THEIR LEARNING TOO.  It’s not an assignment given by the professor. A student can’t control the way a professor teaches. They can only control their own actions. And when their actions are causing others around them to not be able to concentrate, it’s a complete dick move.

I’m all for the different teaching styles that help keep students engaged and learning, buuut that’s not what this thread is about ."
MadeMeSmile,ffia1lw,t3_etnab0,1579968912.0,Please play the long game and stop hanging out at bars. Ive seen this countless times. You are worth it.
MadeMeSmile,ffi9iv5,t1_ffi8dek,1579968544.0,"Glad you’re sober! She’s very new to sobriety though and who knows what kind of inventory she’s doing. Statistically, the longer you remain sober the less likely you are to relapse (not saying it doesn’t happen. Look at Phillip Seymour Hoffman.) Theres a reason why AA and NA suggest 90 meetings in 90 days. It’s a vulnerable time. There’s the “pink cloud” addicts often talk about when they first get sober. You feel invigorated, aren’t constantly sick, just overall feeling better and life can feel refreshing again. Once that wears off, it can be trickier to stay sober. That doesn’t speak for everyone but a common saying is “at all costs” to remain clean.. and this isn’t really that."
MadeMeSmile,ffi957z,t1_ffhg8ix,1579968283.0,Yah. Not the smartest move. She’s playing with fire. Especially at 30 days

wholesomememes,ffi6bkl,t1_ffi3lgq,1579966249.0,Seriously is this person for real? There’s a movie on in front of me and I can just choose to look away? Do they know not everyone operates like them? I’m guessing they are pretty young to be that egocentric.
wholesomememes,ffi5hu3,t1_ffi1uwb,1579965617.0,"No. You’re wrong. [NYT article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.amp.html) 

“The research is unequivocal: Laptops distract from learning, both for users and for those around them.”

Why should someone like me who has ADD be affected by someone who doesn’t care to pay attention, when I’m trying extra hard to pay attention? You know it costs thousands of dollars to go to school right? And you’re an asshole for doing so."
wholesomememes,ffi5aj8,t1_ffi2l47,1579965462.0,"No, studies have shown it’s extremely distracting to everyone around. Why even go to class?"

DunderMifflin,ffhno4h,t1_ffhewzq,1579944157.0,These guys just don’t know what they are talking about. How delusional are they to think they have women figured out? Like we’re dummies sitting at home watching the office all alone with our cats and hoping one day a Jim will sweep us off our feet. Get real.
DunderMifflin,ffh2mg7,t1_ffgzo39,1579921439.0,I’ve literally never met anyone like that and I’m a woman in the Midwest. Wtf are you even talking about? We’re not dumb. We know it’s a fictional show.
MurderedByWords,ffcn6ol,t1_ffc1391,1579803018.0,Ohhh when that puberty starts to hit girls turn into complete bitches. I was an angel child until the hormones kicked in. Chilled out eventually.

aww,ffak51d,t1_ffae0xl,1579737738.0,Aww someone drew a heart next to my little doggies name on his crate. He’s a 6 lb chihuahua but absolutely the sweetest dog that loves people. I think maybe they weren’t used to such a friendly people person chihuahua.

todayilearned,ff6pub6,t1_ff6lw1i,1579632372.0,I see “reposts” a lot by commenters but they are new to me and I’ve been on Reddit for 9 years (not this account). Not everyone is on Reddit at the same time all of the time.
AskReddit,feiwros,t1_feis2y5,1579149339.0,Ugh it’s sooo good. My fav song from the album.
Healthyhooha,feipeju,t1_feikgpv,1579143932.0,"I’ve said it before here but it works so well I’ll say it again! For BV, use boric acid suppositories! You can find them on amazon. It totally works and you don’t have to take antibiotics. I learned this from Reddit!"
AmItheAsshole,fein6qt,t1_fei0o1j,1579142454.0,"She also needs to learn boundaries though. She’s not learning the proper social skills and it’s going to bite her in the ass. Personally, I would answer that some things are not her business, which is completely true."
AskReddit,feimtg1,t1_fei23lm,1579142206.0,"I have a waltz #2 tattoo that says “hour to hour, note to note.” Totally got it when I was 22 and emo, but he’s still one of my favs and I don’t regret it."
AskReddit,feimpct,t1_fehx4lv,1579142130.0,"If you reaaally want to go Lo-fi check out Roman Candle, his first album. I listened to it over and over when I moved to a new city and felt very lonesome."
ADHD,fehlcw0,t1_fegy4gs,1579118885.0,"Something that has helped me with #1 is when I am doing something like that, try to be present even if it’s just for a few seconds to process it. For example, if I were to unplug the iron I would say out loud to myself “ ok I am unplugging the iron. It is off right now”. It seems to help me because my mind isn’t usually present on what I am doing."

sex,fdl4jti,t1_fdjnj6s,1578516930.0,But he wants her to do it herself. He doesn’t want to be the shower police and have to tell her to take a shower like a little kid. Would suck if he has to do this everytime.
sex,fdl43kv,t1_fdkby9b,1578516711.0,"I don’t know you at all OP, and I could be wrong, but I read a lot of resentment and some contempt in your post. I just went through a breakup with my fiancé, so the red flags about how our relationship went down are more easily recognizable and fresh in my brain. It definitely seems deeper like you mentioned."

insanepeoplefacebook,fdkxfrd,t1_fdkps5t,1578513151.0,"It was very unpleasant for me. I felt like I had been punched so hard in my arm the first day I felt it come on. My nerve endings were so sensitive that even a gust of wind would be uncomfortable on my back/arm. I swear I can still feel it 4 years later. But, I was lucky because my friend had it the same year so I was able to identify what it would possibly be and get on antiviral medication ASAP. Catching it early can be key from what I’ve heard."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdkw4x5,t1_fdkr4b2,1578512387.0,I had shingles at 30 because of a bad breakup. I could just feel the stress all over my body and even before the rash appeared there was bad pain in my arm/shoulder. I thought I had pulled my arm the day before. It felt so sore. I hope I never get it again! Stress does horrible shit to your body.
MadeMeSmile,fdkdkm4,t1_fdk40kg,1578501609.0,I once had to go get a candy bar for my diabetic friend after a night of drinking. It was really scary to see him in that state so I can totally see why a friend would want to do that!
AskReddit,fdi368m,t1_fderg35,1578434905.0,"Yah I had a suv pull out behind me and was pretty much riding my ass. It was late and an open road so I was kind of pissed he was tailing me. I wanted to slow down when the speed limit changed but this guy was stressing me out riding my ass. I almost pulled over to let him pass. Then I got pulled over. It was a cop. He was really nice but when he was saying I was speeding I just gave him a confused look saying “well I felt like you were right up on me”. And when he said I swerved a little on the road I told him I was probably looking at his car in my rear view mirror wondering what the hell he was doing. He let me go with a warning thankfully. I know you’re not supposed to worry about cars behind you in regard to speed, but with it being late with no one on the road, I was nervous to pull over."

TwoXChromosomes,fdhrdx5,t1_fdgh91j,1578428687.0,I just graduated from the same school the girl was killed at. I used to use their parking garages all the time and I hate them. They are the perfect place to assault someone. One time I had to use a secluded elevator and when I opened the door there was a burly construction man in there. I was really scared to get in with him. I’m sure he could see it on my face. The things we have to worry about on a daily basis can be tiring.

MadeMeSmile,fczd5e7,t1_fcy6749,1578098547.0,It looks like they are outside of security. Maybe the arriving one left the check point and put it on in the bathroom. Maybe no one was really on a plane and it’s just for the video. Just guesses
chicago,fcu8wp6,t1_fct4h97,1577975345.0,Not from Buffalo Grove. Someone I know was in line yesterday at 4:45 am. Had their order taken in line at 6:00. Was in and out by 6:09 after paying in the building.
