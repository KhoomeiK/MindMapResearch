cats,ff2tpe9,t3_ercbfl,1579523753.0,"My experiences are: Cats can be left alone while at work etc.- however if you are thinking about not letting it outside- so purely an indoor cat - I would suggest two cats. That way they have each other. And when you go
On vacation and someone comes to feed them and clean the litter box - they have each other and companionship:)

Cat food and kitty litter is not that expensive- I would say 30-40$ a month max for two cats.

I have a special cat health insurance to cover expensive stuff like  X-Rays and operations if ever needed. It also covers most of the cost for neutering them and the yearly vaccinations.
I prefer to have the insurance so
i don’t have to worry about costs if I ever need it.

If you don’t plan on letting your cat outside - it lowers the risk of injuries and sicknesses, too. However indoor cats also can get ill and injure themselves I am just saying my experience is that it is far less. I hope this helped a bit ☺️"

I have several brow products I like and use - the one I used in this pic is: NYX Eyebrow Powder Pencil in the shade: auburn. BTW maybe you are interested in checking out my YouTube channel I made a tutorial on this look and name all the products there too 😊 And there are more to come with lots of recommendations. But anyway- glad I could help here 😀 Oh and the pencil is VERY pigmented so you don’t need much and it should last quite a while 👩🏻‍🦰☺️
