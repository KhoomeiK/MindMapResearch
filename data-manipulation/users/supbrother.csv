Geologist here. Honor this man too! He was a ~~seismologist~~ volcanologist who died in the Mount St. Helens eruption. He did a lot of work to further volcanology which of course leads to better volcano safety around the globe."
conspiracy,ffuwdpl,t1_ffuovo9,1580250601.0,"Yep. I mean you definitely twisted some things. I'm pretty sure it was much more than a 1-second delay (but I'd have to look that up). Yes, they communicate through space, I'm not sure why that's supposed to be unbelievable. And of course there were hiccups. Let's not forget that in subsequent moon missions we had failures. And you're just ignoring the probes we have on other planets, for example? Let alone the ones projected to make it outside the solar system (again I'd have to verify that one, it's been awhile). Safe to say those are slightly further out than 100 miles.... And there have been plenty of people to explain why something may look 'off' in the videos and pictures, that has basicslly all been addressed as far as I know. Which presidents said they wanted to go to the moon? I haven't been around *that* long but I've yet to hear those words from a president in my lifetime.

So your evidence is mostly just that it seems far fetched?"

conspiracy,ffup81z,t1_fftqkll,1580246664.0,"And in typical r/conspiracy fashion, you're downvoted for asking about a conspiracy, and you're linked to a completely different conspiracy...... this sub really shoots itself in the foot."
conspiracy,ffungkp,t1_ffulmyr,1580245653.0,Talking in absolutes like that immediately discredits you. There is absolutely no way in hell that you have indisputable proof of that.
conspiracy,ffuna1s,t1_ffts2zs,1580245546.0,"RIP your inbox, I got hounded by people recently for simply asking about the moon landing conspiracy."
WTF,ffoke7f,t1_ffoi32w,1580078535.0,Have you ever tried hiking with a heavy pack while your heels are shredded?
WTF,ffok6p7,t1_ffo4my2,1580078452.0,"If your feet are conditioned and everything fits super well, absolutely. Less is more in a lot of ways. But the double sock method is a much safer way of going about it, especially if doing a crazy march like I'm assuming the guy in the OP did. Much better to have clunkier feet and not get blisters than have better mobility and end up crippled for days afterwards."
