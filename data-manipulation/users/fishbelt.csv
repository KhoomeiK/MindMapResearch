FEEL: I feel stuffy from trying to work with 2 others on what couple be maintained by one person. (this one is difficult for me). Frustrated? Calm? Happy?

THINK: Trying to always update the code and test items through the IBM Cloud UI is cumbersome so I try to always do it through the CLI. Debugging Functions is a hassle.

unpopularopinion,fdxf41x,t1_evu941s,1578768121.0,"This is just going back to nature vs nurture.

There is an argument to be made for nature where you can see slight differences between different breeds of the same species, but it never ends up being of huge significance unless you take two polar opposite breeds that have been bred for generations for different tasks. As of late, pitbulls have been in the spot light for being the underground breed that is meant to attack, but this still requires training; no dog is born ready to be an attack dog.

Nurture is much more powerful because you admit that animals have their own personalities and personal wants/needs in life.

TBH, I will spark a flame by saying this. If you are a die hard Nature supporter then I will gladly lump you in my mind with that of human slave owners that dignify themselves by saying that the African race was bred to be enslaved. Just like in the movie Django."
