Again Leviticus is the only place with any homophobic translations and even that's shaky and being challenged. 

Of course blind belief is way more fun than acknowledging that LGBT+ people have been around since... ever."

Me, it's a way to not give them credit for *our* winter holiday (Xmas vs Solstice) and kept extending past that."
ainbow,ffgoy13,t1_ffgljd9,1579911379.0,"As someone who went to Xtian schools I can say some read the Bible cover to cover, HOWEVER they also misrepresent and mistake and corrupt the meaning from cover to cover to fit whatever bias is in their denomination. 

They also conveniently forget that the Old Testament Laws were supposes to be abandoned because their 'savior's says so.

Oh and I'd have to say absolute best cures for Xtianity is tied between going to a Xtian school and ""The Problem of Evil."" Thank you Philosophy 101.

Showerthoughts,few88ed,t1_feu5bx4,1579406782.0,"Would you expect someone on a walker to keep pace with a normal functioning person? The answer is usually no. 

And if it is no with you as well, then I hope you find kindness for all people and give them a certain amount of time and patience. Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety can be just as crippling as a physical condition, but are also invisible. So it can be hard for people to keep up even if you can't see them struggling.

As someone with both physical and mental, I can say life is often cruel, and thus having a bit of understanding and compassion for others allows for deeper more meaningful connections. And less stress on you, to be fair. 

I hope your own issues are resolved, or at least a little less heavy of a burden in the future."
Showerthoughts,feto1ec,t3_eqk87g,1579377442.0,"This is what many call ""Internalized Homophobia"" where you hate homosexuals because you can't admit you yourself are homosexual and thus can't deal with it.

Showerthoughts,fetnqqh,t1_fethujz,1579377321.0,"Well you have to consider how much shit a trans person goes through. Even recognizing that your gender identity is different from your sex is a very traumatic thing. Being mislabeled, dead-named, abandoned by your family and friends, treated like shit for being yourself, and let's not mention the severe medical issues that go along with hormone treatments and surgeries. And still people are throwing shit at you all the time for just being you. Bullied by society, doctors, and loved ones.

Finding your footing in a world that hates you is tough. Rejecting the religion/biases you've been taught since you were a kid is ridiculously hard. I say this because many of us were taught homophobia and transphobia and have to overcome that in order to be ourselves.

All I'm saying is give trans people a little breathing room to be themselves and settle into their true selves. Depression, anxiety, and so much more happen even to the non-LGBTQ+ community. Now add in being called evil, worrying about basic human rights, and the nonstop bullying and you have a soup of mental distress to deal with. Give people time and space and understanding and you'll see trans people aren't so different because we're all human.

First, I understand why you did what you did. But it is harmful to our cause. No, you are not as bad as them (I hate that cliche), but yes it was a bad thing to do. 

Provoking them adds to their rhetoric. If you want to taunt them, then taunt them with fun facts. Like that many animal species are gay. Or the whole new god is gay thing. Or Jesus said to love everyone. As someone who lives (lived? Idk, they're kinda coming around) in a christian and homophobic household, this fans their flames verbally but does not use physical force. As soon as physical force comes into it, you've crossed a line legally and metaphorically.

The truth is some people are not going to come around. The truth is that some people are going to be nasty small minded bigots. The truth is we are stronger than them if we stay kind and garner larger support and protect ourselves. 

What I fear is provoking that person is going to come after you or someone else when there's not a big group. I fear they're going to hurt someone because of provocation. All it takes is one person walking home alone in the dark and another pissed off person to do major harm.

I understand the heat of the moment but hating homophobes doesn't make you normal. And having one horrible belief does not make their lives worthless. That's a very slippery slope, please slow and stop your slide. This leads to us against them mentality instead of showing them we're people and want to live our lives as normal people. 

For reference telling someone to kill themselves is too far. That's what made me sit down and type this post. 

 I hope you can see this through more mature eyes and admit it was a mistake and either try to make amends for going too far or not go overboard next time. 

I hope your homeless LGBT youth event went well otherwise. I hope they get the help they need.

TL;DR: Keep an eye out for retaliation. Escalating violence and taunting with things like go kill yourself is too far. Protect your rainbow family with kindness."
