offmychest,fewprvr,t1_few6qin,1579417666.0,What? They're like Middle America girls too?
offmychest,fev47d6,t1_fev323o,1579392953.0,"Exactly my point.  People my age still go out, but with couples."
offmychest,feuth8v,t1_fesr00u,1579389717.0,"Both, actually.  That or constantly being with their S.O. I reckon I need to venture out, as in a place where people around my age are more like-minded."
offmychest,ferl0a1,t1_ferfglm,1579355271.0,"I guess I need to go to Britain/Oz/NZ then and find me an English girl because here in America, particularly in the Midwest, EVERY ONE is playing house these days."
offmychest,fer42zl,t3_eqf9br,1579349538.0,"Turn 35 next week and totally can relate.  The 30s suck majorly.  This time is what I've referred to as ""Everyone is Playing House"" stage.  Hopefully they'll all get divorced when they hit 40 and it will be fun again.  For now, you be you and focus on what makes you happy.  Hint: It doesn't involve a person."
offmychest,fer3ht8,t1_fep6ten,1579349355.0,"The grass is always greener mentality.  Hell, this is most applicable to online dating."
offmychest,fejfepv,t3_ephe2n,1579171564.0,"Ask her out at the end of your internship.  If she is sending invites and texts, she is interested."
offmychest,fejfb7w,t1_fejechb,1579171417.0,"Not ashamed of being a whore?  Stop misconstruing this post as some misogynistic rant.  This is online dating from a guy perspective, plain and simple.  It clearly caters to single women."
offmychest,fegqsn8,t3_eounac,1579100350.0,I was on Paxil for a brief time and it is practically the No Fap pill.  Definitely kills your libido.  I would research some herbal supplements like St. John's Wort or GABA.
apexlegends,fdmn2rg,t3_em4o08,1578556300.0,"Had so much potential at the beginning but then it gradually became trash during its first year.  

-World's Edge sucks.  Bring back King's Canyon.

-The lag compensation/netcode sucks.

-The sheer trashiness of your random squadmates.  Players actually played as a team in the beginning but now it's bot central.  Stop with the solo shit too.  Shit is annoying.  *drops solo, gets knocked soon after, dips*  APEX IS A TEAM GAME.

-The whole trend of making new modes for a limited time is so shitty.  Who gives a fuck about lobby queues?  We all leave early anyway since our squad is trash.  Make Solo and Duo modes permanent."
offmychest,fd6jna6,t1_fd6hhnw,1578192054.0,Ask another co-worker for their number.  Or look up the contact list.
offmychest,fd64upc,t3_ek3q72,1578185551.0,Ask them out!  What do you have to lose?
offmychest,fcos5n9,t3_eiafle,1577840092.0,And this is why people like myself looking for an actual relationship get frustrated with these apps for this very reason.
offmychest,fcos1o2,t3_eiaivv,1577840008.0,"I may be antisocial but I have never seen good-looking people randomly kiss.   Ew, mono."
offmychest,fcora13,t3_eibdao,1577839428.0,Thank you.  And you too.
offmychest,fckoe9p,t3_ehpktw,1577729709.0,Try being 35 and still not know what to do with your life.  You have plenty of time to decide.
offmychest,fc89jp0,t1_fc86d7l,1577529926.0,"I think being loved for who you are requires you to love someone for who they are too.  Warts and all.  

Truthfully, it's 50/50.  You want someone who is just as good-looking as their personality and vice versa."
offmychest,fc88xzy,t1_fc5dd7j,1577529533.0,"I'm in my mid-30s and this response resonated with me.  I reside in the Midwest and at my age you're basically a closet case if you aren't married, let alone have a long-term girlfriend, by now.  Yeah, I got on those dating apps-which actually make me more depressed/hopeless opposed to being lonely/single-and had some dates with  women who were kind and pleasant, but absolutely no connection nor attraction whatsoever.  And that what it all boils down to: Connection.  The woman we want may judge us on our incomes or what we drive or still live in an apartment, but I think it would be bullshit if we said we never judged the same as well.  I sure have.  Guilty AF.  Basically what I'm trying to convey is genuine attraction/connection is elusive and we have to make excuses on why we don't a relationship with the other party.  You've got to question the marriages of high school/college sweethearts too.  Have those couples merely settled or do they genuinely love each other?  You'll never get the truth if you ask them directly.  Plus it appears me and you are at very different stages of life compared to women our age.  The 30s/40s females are mostly single moms (baggage, let's not kid ourselves).  We, on the other hand, are acting act like we are in our early 20s.  That's why you said you seem to connect to the 20-something women more so than your own age group.  It's 4 A.M. and I'm writing this on my phone.  Essentially what I'm trying to say is let it happen and enjoy the ride instead of forcing it to happen, relationship-speaking.  You be you and fuck anyone who says you have to compromise yourself by becoming a normie in order to be more marketable for the dating market.  Yes, the cold hard truth about being yourself in the dating world is complete bullshit.  You will not get dates by being yourself right off the bat.  Finding a girlfriend is no different than finding a job.  But...being yourself will get the right one."
offmychest,fc85tmm,t3_egp3o8,1577527520.0,"Because they're the female-equivalent fantasy.  (Yeah-yeah, sorry for genderizing conventional fantasy in the age of ""equality"".  And I use quotes for ""equality"" because those traits and values are suspiciously left at the door once a woman wants to date/get courted.)

Basically, they're intentionally schmaltzy to make you keep watching, reading or buying.  Romance never works like that in real world.  Only in the movies."
offmychest,fc65qgj,t3_egaamv,1577472887.0,"So it's true: Income is a big factor in courtship.  

Knew it.  Well, I might be joining a monastery, then."
