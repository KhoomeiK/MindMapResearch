WTF,femn60m,t1_femcyau,1579263364.0,It's the cheapest and in a lot of cases most practical.
woodworking,felfloo,t3_epmsfl,1579221020.0,I am generally not a fan of poplar unless I am painting it but damn that looks good.
fakehistoryporn,fegnt7r,t1_fegnnk5,1579098250.0,"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
todayilearned,fedb220,t1_fed60o9,1579006234.0,"I mean I'm not gonna lie, it was entertaining."
todayilearned,feckaqc,t1_fec6pfa,1578975987.0,What the fuck did I just read.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdwngd1,t1_fdwmc5h,1578760488.0,Yes. And saying cops going undercover is illegal is laughable at best.
firstworldanarchists,fdhzqpk,t1_fdhvihk,1578433133.0,"It says walk right on the fucking thing. What part of that is unspoken? And even if what you said wasn't complete bullshit about damaging it, that's on the people who own it. If it actually did that they wouldn't put walk on one side."
todayilearned,fcxqnho,t1_fcxmxvh,1578069135.0,Going off what the article stated. Not surprise literally none of you read it though.
todayilearned,fcwsjcc,t1_fcwbzds,1578035861.0,"Mid grade in this case is 89. 91 would be premium.

Edit: apparently no one actually read the article. Shocker."
todayilearned,fcwsdub,t1_fcwkccl,1578035685.0,"An engine knock is fuel detonating earlier than it should, due to compression. Higher compression can cause lower grade fuel to detonate early. If your car just started knocking at idle I would imagine the knocking noise is not actually an engine knock in this case, but something else making that noise. Unless your car requires higher grade and you just started putting in regular.  Although while I do all my own work on my cars, I am not a mechanic. So maybe someone else can give you a better answer on that."
AskReddit,fcizmdd,t1_fcig8zh,1577673636.0,Cult plus time equals religion.
AskReddit,fciz3bm,t1_fcih6kn,1577673284.0,"And someone who is black out drunk would probably say the same thing. Obviously not an equal comparison, but it shows my point."
AskReddit,fciyvjo,t1_fcis9lt,1577673132.0,Well I think there is a lot of people who think smoking weed is safe. I know a lot of people I used to hang around when I smoked thought that.
HadToHurt,fcf8850,t1_fcbthbx,1577627449.0,A lot of big cities have high pressure systems. My suburban city has 70 to 80 psi in almost every hydrant and this looks like quite a bit more than what that.
woodworking,fcahw61,t3_egvw1r,1577569526.0,What did you do to get the rustic look on the boards?
educationalgifs,fc7d49q,t1_fc7c4gz,1577503917.0,I'm right there with you. And I wish my department would go to smooth bores. I hate our automatic nozzles.
AskRedditAfterDark,fbz9kas,t1_fbz8ly7,1577239379.0,You won't be disappointed!
