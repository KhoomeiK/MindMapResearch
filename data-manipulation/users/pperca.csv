I'm sure you are excited and eager to get going but 1 yr as jr analyst and 7 months as a financial modeler are not very strong qualifications to understand the market or the issues with the model you are proposing. 

>I haven’t worked in the development and construction of, but that’s a risk that has largely been mitigated as we will be working with industry EPC and developers for that.

Without having any measurable experience on their business, that's really not risk mitigation but more wishful thinking, I'm afraid. 

Also, that made me even more confused with your proposed business model. Is your company a kickstarter like website or do you intend to actually build and run those solar farms? 

>We recognize there’s gaps in our knowledge—and that’s why we have a board of advisors that we get guidance from! 

Advisors are great but unless they are embedded with you, they won't be a lot of help with day to day operations. 

Also, it's a little bit strange to have a NG executive advising on your ""less cut the carbon footprint"" quest. I can see why you asked Aaron to be an advisor but it kinds of raises some questions on your mission.

Also, is Michael Shore an advisor or consultant? It seems after leaving BarberWind (not quite successful company), he decided to provide consulting advice to company like yours. I wonder how much time he will have for you. 

>There are many industry standard forms such as the PVsyst, 8760, IA agreements, System layouts, etc. that we would be reviewing. 

I'm not sure how much help that would be for your average investor. You guys don't seem to have the experience to understand the larger implications of site selection, configurations, operating issues and the larger market future demand/capacity constraints (and sorry, part time consultants/advisors won't replace that experience) and I bet your investors can't even understand those things exist. Mostly, they would think a solar farm is the same as panels on their roof. 

>Additionally, we’re actually working on our own diligence model to help us create an added layer of diligence so that we can filter out potentially bad projects.

Sorry but I have to call BS on that. Even Softbank made a serious mistake with their $200B investment in Saudi Arabia because (surprise), the project failed to address grid integration. I really haven't seen anything in this thread that demonstrates the ability to develop such model, especially since your investors will solely depend on that. 

A company with so little experience guided by part time consultants/advisors is likely to end up with a ton of questionable assets. Only after a lot of wins and failures, that you will be able to build such model reliably. What happens if by making the wrong bets you end up with a large portfolio of non-performing assets?

>We wouldn’t be hiding financials. 

How good would financials do if the analysis is flawed? During the tech bubble of the 2000's the financials looked awesome but they were all vaporware. 

>Regulation A+

If you are using Reg A+, I'm even more concerned now. 

Reg A+ has a lot of potential for abuse, fraud and letting unsuspecting investors to believe a company's business model is sound when it's far from it.

For the ones reading this, Reg A+ is basically an exception the SEC created to allow startups to raise money from individuals without having a proven business model. While normal rules require experts to evaluate a company's plan before investors pour money is, Reg A+ bypasses all of this and a company can just convince you to invest base on a fuzzy promise of tracking your carbon footprint. 

It's true Reg A+ requires some level of financial transparency (which also requires expertise for those disclosures that your company doesn't seem to have yet), but it's quite irrelevant if you are selling is a guilt token (convincing people that they need to invest in your company to save the planet). 

While institutional investors will look at future yields, the non-accredited ones you are targeting won't really understand the investment risks.

I'm curious why you decided to go thru Reg A+ (with all the overhead that it will entail), instead of going after the vast amount of venture capital already available today. If you model is sound and profitable, I see no issues raising capital. 

>I don’t know what you are implying about the tech bubble

You would be good for you guys to do some research. In the tech bubble, a lot of startups looked promising because their financials showed a lot of revenue coming in. The problem was the revenue came from other startups that were selling in a sort of a round-robin. In other words, a house of cards. 

In your model, focusing on site capacity and layout will give the false idea that all the capacity will be able to be monetized. However, like the Saudi example shows, without the proper grid and energy storage changes, those sites will just go bankrupt before they can provide any return.

As those sites go under, it will bring a domino effect to investor's returns and the model will fail. 


>We will take this feedback to heart

If you want to take any feedback, take this one: you need a more comprehensive view of the energy grid to pull this off. Financial return (the main objective of investments) come from a complete understanding of risks, not just a partial one. 

Also, avoid gimmicks. The real time carbon metric sounds like useless feature that won't mean anything actual but will prey on people's conscience. Maybe that's what you are going for but it really makes your offer looks gimmicky."

todayilearned,fe18ul6,t1_fe0ze82,1578823874.0,">people do not simply reach out to deities or God to feel ""safe""

Really? Is that why people are always asking for protection, good health, prosperity, etc. in their prayers? It sure looks like an attempt to feel safer. 

>it is obscene to attempt to source studies of human psychology for that false premise.

Those are just facts. It's fascinating that every religion is based on the same psychological traits. It doesn't matter how ancient or where it is located. It's always an attempt to ask for that protection against the enemies and in most cases, justify wars against the non-believers. 

Also fascinating trait is that usually people in power highjack whatever teaching (as autistic as they may have started) and twist them to fit a political agenda. 

Constantine I saw Christianity as a way to take away power from the priests of the ancient Roman gods. Under his direction, only the texts that supported his agenda were considered canon, everything else was destroyed. 

> Second of all, most religious people do not simply carry out practices because they ""create the illusion of control"". They carry them out because they are logical actions that they believe will lead them to be on ""good terms"" with God or their chosen deity.

And why do they need to be in good terms with their deity? To prevent something bad from happening to them? To be able to have their prayers of protection to be answered? Again, it does sound a lot like need for control in their lives and fear of the unknown. 

Also, most people get involved in religion based on how they were raised. It's called indoctrination. That practice is also depended on not questioning anything that deviates from gospel, because if you start thinking for yourself, many of those assertions made by ancient people do not hold true anymore. 

For me the mask fell when a priest tried to explain the passage ""it's easier for a camel to pass the eye of a needle than a rich person to enter the kingdom of God"" - Bible, New Testament. Today nobody actually knows what camel and what eye of the needle Jesus was referring to. Camel in that time could have been an animal or a very thick rope. Eye of the needle could have been an actual needle or the small passage found next to the gates of major fortresses that were designed to allow just a person to pass at the time. 

So, if people today can't really be certain of the context, what else is just interpretation that fits the narrative of whoever wants to use religion as a form of political control? Just like Constantine, most religious texts are mere expressions of what the ruling class wanted them to be at the time. 

Today we have the absurd of people rejecting actual, factual and irrefutable science because it conflicts with their religious texts (e.g. some people trying to convince themselves that God buried dinosaur bones to mess with us). 

>No sense of control is added or taken away due to carrying out these practices.

Absolutely there is. The faithful tries to be in the good side of their God, hoping good things will happen to them. That's fear and need for reassurance. 

Religious leader instill fear in the faithful to keep them in line. Catholic Church trying to regulate sex, Jewish faith regulating what you can eat, where women can pray, who can you marry, Muslins controlling what you wear, where women can go, etc.. It's all about fear and control, nothing more. 

>you are in a way elevated 

I never claimed that, I'm simply pointing out that blind faith is dangerous and has led to many bad things (wars, violence, rape, oppression). 

When you mention that the Quran is based on science, that's when the alarms went off for me. 

Even if there were scientists at the time with important discoveries that were somehow cited and added to the text, scriptures are by definition words of faith, which means they don't have proof (because otherwise they would be fact). 

Many deities have come and gone: Egypt, Greece, Rome, Aztecs, Mayans and many have tried to become the one true God (Catholic, Jewish, Muslin, Hindu, Buddhists). Some have even a personality disorder, like the God in the Christian Bible who's a total prick in the Old Testament and somehow an all loving one in the New Testament but still makes his son suffer a horrible death. 

Just like the ancient gods that disappeared when science explained them away (planets, Sun, Moon, etc.), I believe in the future our knowledge of the Universe will make the need for an invisible and unexplainable force to not be necessary anymore. We only fear what we don't understand and knowledge will help humanity get rid of this shackle."

There are some interesting studies done about religion across different eras and cultures. For a society to function, leaders are chosen to keep the group together and safe. However, when scary things happened (e.g. an extend drought), those leaders may not have all the answers so people turn to religious figures. That's how harvest offerings and other acts that religious figures says will appease their deities ended up becoming practice. It's something that creates the illusion of control. 

It's human nature to want to have control over their lives, so I really don't fault people to want to believe in deities. For most people, that's actually good because it helps them get thru difficult times. However, it also opens the door for abuse, as they believe their religious leaders speak for these deities when in reality, they usually only care about their own power and interests.

>One of our goals is to make it extremely easy to invest in these types of products while also surfacing important details about the underlying assets in a clean and transparent way.

During the tech bubble of the 2000's, it was extremely easy to invest in tech companies that inflated their revenue numbers by making out deals with other tech startups. No real money existed, just paper. 

Ease of investment is not the issue here. Let's assume you are widely successful, make tons of money in fees, a huge number of non viable farms are funded and the whole thing crashes. The fossil fuel companies would have a field day with that financial disaster, solar will have a huge set back, investors will be out of their money but you guys will keep the fees.

>If the average investor of a solar ETF like Invesco wanted more information on what they were invested in they would have to dig through the SEC filings of the individual companies comprising the ETF. One of our goals is to make understanding what your invested in as easy and transparent as possible.

The reason why the SEC is involved in securities and investments is to prevent scams. If the average investors can't read an SEC filing, that person has no business investing in a model like yours. 

Unless you intent to file the same disclosures as an ETF and be regulated the same, I believe transparency won't mean much since there's no actual oversight.

Again, solar production and reduction in carbon emissions are not the same thing. The grid usually can't handle the extra energy at peak hours from solar and wind. Most of that energy is wasted, especially if not forecasted correctly. The bidding in the morning is what defines what goes in the grid, so monitoring production does nothing more than understand production availability. 

>this is a cool new feature we can offer that provides a transparency from a climate change impact perspective that people haven't seen before!

With all due respect, it's a gimmick designed to attack uneducated investors that will be fooled into believing that's a real metric. 

Again, you guys seem to be trying to oversimplify a very complex and intricate market just to become a trade desk for a niche targeting non sophisticated investors."

I'm not sure how familiar you are with investments but if a company is mass producing a product that's not selling, they usually don't get returns of 50+%.

todayilearned,fdzatcv,t1_fdz4hlg,1578788300.0,"Fun fact: at the time the Quran was written, archaic semitic languages (Aramaic or Syriac) were used. A lot of what you find in modern languages is an interpretation with modern cultural references of what some of these ancient texts have. 

Trying to have literal translation to modern words and claiming that they represent the cultural references of the time is a fool's errant. 

It's expected that, with iron being the strongest material available for weapons at the time and following superstitious beliefs that some invisible deity was controlling events and helping them, the interpretation that ""sent down iron"" refers to divine inspiration for metallurgy, not meteorites. So that's not a literal description of iron ore being sent down to Earth from a deity. 

To ancient people, metallurgy was a really magical process where common materials were made stronger by fire (associate with the Sun, especially in the desert). 

Sorry but trying to attach scientific validity to superstitious text written by ancient people using archaic and mostly dead languages, texts that have been translated over centuries being reinterpreted by the current cultural references, is really an effort in futility."

1) You are tech developers who do not really have financial investment background or deep knowledge of the solar energy space. 

2) The people you expect to crown fund these farms likely do not have that knowledge either and I don't see anything in your proposal that will help a regular investor decide which projects to fund (that's why ETFs have professionals with decades in the industry to ""handpick which solar projects"" to invest). Solar investments are not Instagram posts for you to ""like"". It requires a minimum of understanding of the energy market, solar technology and investigation on the background of the company running the farm to be a realistic proposal. I don't see your proposal of ""letting a layman pick a solar project to invest"" as a benefit at all. 

3) All you seem to offer is a vague promise of ""my future emissions will be tracked by an app on my phone"". I'm not really quite sure what you are planning to track here, how relevant it is or what that has to do with efficiency and financial health of the farm you intend to fund. 

So, instead of investing in SEC regulated solar ETFs (some that have been producing some very healthy returns of 50+% YTY which are driving more investments and new projects), do you expect people to send investment money to your GoFund style platform with no return guarantees and some questionable tech features like a fuzzy carbon metric?

I sincerely hope that's not all you are proposing and that the friends and family members that provided with you with the angel funding do not need that money. 

A real solar investment offering will require a lot more sophisticated energy planning tooling to assess investment and viability of those farms (location, sun coverage, local demand, local supply, grid capabilities, energy trading figures, historic energy bid analysis with predictions and trends). You don't seem to be even in the ballpark of that kind of plan.
