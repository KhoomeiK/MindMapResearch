moderatepolitics,ffornoq,t1_ffoivre,1580080876.0,"I’ll touch on a couple of these.

>VAT tax?

>Tarrif on imports from Nations with no VAT tax?

>Reducing or ending income tax?

I do not know why people want a VAT. I do not know why people want a regressive tax that decreases their purchasing power just so the government can have more money.

I understand Europe and other countries have this tax but that isn’t reason enough to increase taxes.

The only way a VAT makes sense is if we eliminate the income tax and solely use the VAT.

>UBI replacing TANF and tax rebates?

We aren’t in a position to need a UBI. We have around 4% unemployment.

It doesn’t make sense to tax people at lets say 12k plus administration fees and then give them the money back, specially if they don’t need it. Instead we should define who needs help (poverty line) and give them benefits. Wait that sounds very similar to the system we already have.

>Ending Federal minimum wage regulations?

I’m completely for this as a Federal minimum wage doesn’t reflect the varying standards of living across the US.

>Making Social Security opitional?

It would collapse. Although I’d prefer to manage my own money."
AskTrumpSupporters,ffnebp3,t1_fflx9v4,1580064834.0,">I personally have a MS in Statistics and an MBA, and from my education and work experience, most employers want the best employee for the lowest salary and overall cost. I am unsure, but do you think an employer incentive plan to address student debt could work in attracting talent for both private and public sectors? How would you sell it to big name employers to offer this type of plan?

The military has been doing this exact plan for decades. For instance if they need doctors they have several options: contract them out, train them themselves or send applicants to med school while in the military or commission someone straight off the street.

It’s cheaper for the military to commission someone who’s already trained as they don’t have to set up facilities, pay tuition for students who may fail out etc. They also offer student loan repayment for new enlistees as a way to get educated people in the force.

It would be easy to sell to organizations with retention problems as you keep that individual until their loan is repaid.

But it’s also a supply/demand problem. If theirs excess people with whatever degree you won’t need to offer them the works to get them to work for you.

>Should the local government employer offer some incentive as opposed to having these federal programs?

I think it would need to be Federal as I don’t see a lot of positions in state governments that need to be filled by people with degrees."

Yes. We shouldn’t be incentivizing people to incur large amounts of debt for careers that won’t cover it.

>What policy or expectation for those types of borrowers would you prefer in its place? I’ve heard capping repayments per month, like $500, from some of my conservative friends and family to a set amount and just keep on extending the repayment plan, like 30 yrs, 40yrs, 50yrs, to pay for the debt plus interest.

>Do believe that in an American democracy where voters are only given two primary candidates, that purity tests serve much of a purpose at all?

I think they’re completely worthless in Presidential elections but do serve a purpose in the primaries to help eliminate candidates who may not support your core issues and push others to support said issues.

Specially now that both parties seem to have 15+ candidates starting out. It would take a good amount of time to look through each candidates proposals, chart them out and see who you should support based on policy and not feelings. Where you can instead pick a couple policy positions for what a *progressive* President should entail like M4A, free college etc and filter out a bunch that don’t meet your criteria.

>How did the locals in those zones view the US in general, and you personally?

Generally indifferent depending on the local political climate. For instance in Baghdad the Christians loved us being there and would sing us songs from Michael Jackson. Where the locals in rural Kandahar province were torn because the area was controlled to the Taliban.

>How did serving in these zones affect your view of the US?

Shortly after joining the military I was Uber conservative. Deploying to countries like Afghanistan/Iraq/Pakistan/Congo pushes me to the left because it showed me the importance of government. When I was in Kandahar Province I took a Terrorism 400 course through Liberty online. Through a lot of reading and personal experience I noticed that a country with a non-existent government (libertarian dream) is a hotbed for terrorism because people require social order/services.

Members of the government swear allegiance to the Constitution, not the President. If he/she refused to leave for whatever reason they’d just be escorted out and arrested. It’d be very anti-climatic."
AskTrumpSupporters,fevp5yb,t1_fevie0u,1579399890.0,The my real problem is you’d have to raise taxes elsewhere as property ownership is a big source of revenue. I don’t know which ones would be the *fairest.*

AskTrumpSupporters,feuppf0,t1_feu3cm8,1579388808.0,">Just an idea - if you disagree with this, im curious what your opposition is to a family owning the property they live in. In your scenario, would families need to get permission from the gov't for all modifications to the houses?

I completely disagree. I have no opposition to people owning homes but the conversation came up on rent control in an economics discussion.

Rent increases because property value and taxes increase."

Shouldn’t be a surprise when property taxes increase."
Economics,feogz86,t1_feogant,1579299979.0,">Right now a lot of people have the opposite. Every year their rent goes up because of taxes put on the owner.

Sounds like the issue is the government should stop increasing taxes."

Economics,fen1p0i,t1_femzi2t,1579274998.0,How is this stimulative? All you’re doing is transferring the responsibility of who pays for the service from the landlord to the taxpayers.
Economics,femyd52,t3_eq0k4o,1579272772.0,">**Causes under-maintenance:** In organic markets, the clearing price landlords set for apartments will be high enough to cover expenses; otherwise they’ll go out of business. But in rent-controlled markets, there’s a revenues-expenses mismatch. While the costs of land, labor, taxes, and maintenance rise based on market factors, revenues are set by the government, and often aren’t enough to cover costs. Various papers have found that this causes deferred maintenance, leading to shoddy housing, and preventing the vast sums generated by repair investment from flowing through the economy.

This is the biggest issue I have. You’re fixing how much someone can charge for the unit but not the expenses associated with the unit. I don’t see how it’s a long term solution unless the government owns those units."
