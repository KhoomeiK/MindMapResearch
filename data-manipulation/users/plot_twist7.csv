Comparing yourself to someone you share no genetic link to is meaningless. You have no idea what their genetics are, what their diet looks like, if they are taking dangerous steroids that will harm them later on (and are especially dangerous to take in the middle of puberty), etc. 

The only people you might want to compare yourself to is your own father (ask him what age he started/ finished puberty, find pictures of him at your age) and your mothers brothers. That’s the only real clue you could get about where you might be. But even then, hormones can still be a crapshoot of randomness. 

I wouldn’t recommend supplements. Usually with men, just increasing your calories will start muscle building. You can’t build muscle if there’s nothing to build it with. You could start with a protein shake 3x a day and go from there. Make sure your diet is good...chips and processed foods won’t build anything. Lean meats, whole grain starches, and vegetables are going to be best for fueling your workouts. A 16yr old boy going through puberty could burn over 4000 calories a day naturally(without working out) so make sure you are eating enough and are eating right."

Regardless, you are 16. There’s a heck of a lot of hormones headed your way that will change everything about your body."

aww,fd6u7fs,t1_fd6s9lh,1578195768.0,"It is 100% at the discretion of the business owner. A legitimate service dog trainer would always approach the owner of a business first and ask for permission. Most of the time it is granted, but “in training” animals are not protected by federal law. The area gets tricky when people train their own service animals instead of purchasing one from a trainer and we have to rely on the honesty of those that self-train to identify their animal as “in training”. 

As a reminder a Service Animal is an animal that is trained to provide a *medically necessary* task.  They are protected because they are considered medical devices (like oxygen tanks or wheelchairs) and are not legally considered animals while they are on task.  An emotional support animal is NEVER considered a service animal. 

From the ADA website: “When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person’s disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.”  https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm"
aww,fd6gsft,t1_fd5sl5o,1578190779.0,"This is a common misconception but a totally harmless one nonetheless. 

In truth, it’s 100% up to the handler and their trainers how they decide to handle free time. Each and every dog has a different task. For example, a seizure dog never stops working (because who knows when a seizure will come) so the handler will have to find ways to incorporate fun time and mentally easy tasks into their day. On the opposite side of the spectrum, most seeing eye dogs I know get 3-4 30 minute breaks a day. It’s usually only seeing eye dogs that associate “no harness” with “not working” because their job is so mentally taxing on them. A seizure dog, panic disorder dog, mobility assistance dog, etc will be more “ingrained” into human lifestyles and it’s a challenging balance for their handlers to make sure they are finding time to be a dog and also having their own medical needs serviced. The care and maintenance of a service dog is incredibly time consuming and definitely not for everyone but is 110% life changing for those that do decide it’s worth the sacrifice. 

Btw there are no states in the US that require dogs to wear vests that identify them as service dogs. While the ADA is federal law, it remains a state right to decide the the minutia of the applications of the law, including vest identification and prosecution for fraudulent animals."
aww,fd6fkpa,t1_fd62vhk,1578190225.0,"A service dogs job is not to be fearless. It’s to do whatever job they are supposed to do for their handler. In the early stages of training, they get an enormous amount of desensitizing but since most places do not allow “In Training” service animals in (they are not required to allow in training ones in by law, so this is ok) it’s nearly impossible to expose them to what they would perceive as a moving version of their favorite toy x1000 in size. This is a normal reaction for an animal and it stayed in line with its training by not abandoning its handler. A non-service dog (and even some perfectly well trained service dogs) would be in the corner cowering at this experience.
