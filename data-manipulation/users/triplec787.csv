The offense runs through George, we need someone who can fill in better than Dwelley has in the past, god forbid something happen. 

Basically I’m happy if we do address it, and happy if we don’t lol"

49ers,fguca4a,t1_fgub190,1581117337.0,I definitely am comfortable moving forward with Kittle/Dwelley/Toilolo to be honest. He barely played this season and we were still across the board strong at TE.

What happened? Did Aston Martin just not update the styles enough? The trend definitely seems to be going more “aggressive” looking than sleek but still. The Vulcan is still, IMO, a top 10 car ever in terms of how purely beautiful it is, but obviously that $2.5m price tag puts it out of reach for... everyone lol"

AskReddit,fgjxw15,t1_fgj2ixu,1580853537.0,"Why wouldn't they? I was involved in many hiring situations and if you aren't honest about the role and duties, the person is going to hate themselves. You want someone who understands the risks, but still wants to work for you instead of misleading someone and taking them away from a job they might be happier in."
AskReddit,fgjxkgh,t1_fgizs29,1580853345.0,"This is huge, and frankly can provide some great insight to how the interviewer feels about YOU as well. If it is canned, kind of bland, etc., they may not be too into you. If it's personal, it shows ""hey we do this stuff, and this is stuff we'd also like to do with YOU (or whoever is hired).

For example I was the ""personality check"" for my role in many hiring situations. Basically I was brought in to make sure we vibe well, meshed, and could work well together. If I liked the person, I'd sell them on the job with ""Every friday we take a longer lunch, go to a burger place down the street and play pool and hang out, a lot of fridays around 3:00 we'll grab some beer and play Mario Kart in the conference room"", etc. If I didn't like them as much, I'd be more boring about what we do."
AskReddit,fgjwtqh,t1_fgjo9u5,1580852933.0,"There's definitely a way to play it off without seeming like a douche. If you have already established a rapport with the hiring manager it can come off as funny and committed, but if you try to force it in it'll seem arrogant and cocky. Like my last interview we had a great conversation, you could tell that the business part was more or less over and it was more of a culture fit where we talking sports, hobbies etc. My interviewee got up to grab a drink, and offered to grab me one while he was up, I just responded with ""I'll do whatever you're having"" he came back with beers and said ""How about a celebratory beer?"" to which I replied, ""what, no champagne?"". Does it seem cocky? Sure, but it was clearly a joke, he loved it, told the story later at a team building exercise as a point where he knew he'd want to work with me. It's all about reading the room, understanding the relationship and vibe, and sure taking a small risk with humor. Granted that was in sales where you need to have a bit of cockiness and edge to be successful, but it was clearly a joke.

> Do you have any other questions for me?
