rpg,fgy68hj,t1_fgwq1bv,1581179900.0,"Well that depends on setting really, if mages are common then it's fully justifiable to mage-proof your dungeon.

Yup that's to heavy for mage hand, ah sorry mate for some reason dimension door doesn't seem to work near that gate, as you try a different spell you notice that it also doesn't work.

I had a small magocracy who could intercept incoming teleports into the major cities they controlled. Teleportation is a huge security issue after all.

But if a dungeon in an area where mages are a rarity gets assaulted by a party with a wizard or something, well then it's kinda normal their some of their defences are easily circumvented. (unless the owner expected some to turn up of course)"

Most of the lodge events for children are good but I always pick up dull somehow which is really awful.

Also you have the risk of your child running away. While this doesn't eliminate them from succession it does removes them from your control."
ManyATrueNerd,fgvaqv4,t3_f0hrcx,1581142594.0,"Stefans host: ""I don't know where he is"" 

He is leading his troops (the blue marker with the sword to right of his portrait) Left click his portrait, it'll zoom to where he is on the map. But most likely this'll be to an area in fog of war.

But when you hover over his portrait you also get a list of info. In there it's says which county he is in specifically. At the moment you were talking about him he was in Thessalia.

You can always figure out where someone is.

""I can't change succession laws regardless unless the vassals like me."" ...Well they did actually up until fairly recently. Can't really say what changed that though.

If you are gonna fight in your lieges war you might as well officially join it so he likes you better. Cause technically you are not in that war. Right click your lieges portrait>offer to join war.

""Prince Stefan has 150 galleys"" Yea hosts just always get 150 galleys, I guess it's to make sure that if they start on an island or really far away they can always get where they need to be. I've seen the invading force range from 2000 to somewhere in the 10000's but the fleets are always 150.

Revolt or not attacking the Byzantines at this point is still a huge risk. Byzantine revolts are 95% of the time to overthrow the current Basileus meaning it doesn't really matter who wins, they'll reunite afterwards. If either side doesn't swing a huge force at you immediately the revolt also just might end and then you are stuck in a war with the united remainder. Which usually is bigger than either side of the revolt.

""They do still work for me right? Yes they do still work for me."" No they do not, at least the high chief of Bosnia does not. You are a high chief, you do not rule over another high chief even if it is your little brother. But there are some fun casus belli with siblings who have claims on each other. Or if you pick the war focus. Or try and make an alliance with him."

""And the comments are going to be full off people furious that I didn't figure out...""

Well The Binding of Isaac is kinda enervating to watch someone new play. It's got quite a few ""mundane"" secrets that people who've played it a lot know by heart. Something they do automatically you might completely miss. (for instance there's something special about rocks you didn't notice. It's similar to the rock with the bomb in it but more subtle.) But the thing is, the game is also at it best when you figure it out yourself. Going to a wiki and seeing what everything does ruins the experience I'd say. And it's as you say, most of it makes sense. And the things that don't really, become apparent when you've seen it happen a few times. (like the black hearts)"
ManyATrueNerd,fg8hivw,t1_fg80n0m,1580619665.0,"Alright. I guess you could always calculate it yourself if you look at the levy/tax laws but those say +30% or something. But I don't know how, if that's +30% of your troops or if there's a base percentage taken and then +30% is calculated of that.

And yea that's what Jon was looking at/ I was talking about. I'd say it can be still kinda important to know with feudal rulers when you are denying them levies (be it because he's your liege or trough alliances). But only at a small scale."

That is 300 Fielded/200 Garrisoned/600 full potential

You can still access those 200 garrisoned troops by disbanding your troops (and never disband in enemy territory especially when you intend to reuse them immediatly, you did this last episode) and redeploying them instead of waiting for them. 

The downside of this is that they'll be scattered across your territories again as if you deployed them normally but when you don't own that many lands it doesn't really matter unless the enemy is in them.

Oh thank Perun he noticed.

""He has a 1000- odd troops"" Yes but 329 of those come from vassals, and you are his only vassal who owns counties. He at most has a a vassal who controls a town and one with a church. Maybe one of these two is barony like you had. Towns and churches barely provide any levy. So I'm guessing that at least 250 of the troops he has are yours. Hell he even passed the Noble Levy focus and you are his only noble vassal.

(Does anyone know where you can see how many levies you provide to your liege?)

But honestly the only time I wouldn't save the ncr farms is on a legion run where I go full evil bastard as a default.

You save the sharecropper farms which farm for the NCR in exchange for protection. The people you are hurting directly are the farmers, you only hurt the NCR in the long run.
