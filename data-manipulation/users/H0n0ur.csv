summonerschool,fg4kcds,t3_ew2szn,1580505051.0,"D1 player here with 2 Smurf accounts. 1 is in bronze and I use it to play with low elo freinds. I dodge promos to keep it bronze. The other smurf is in gold or plat at any point in time and its for testing new builds or practicing new champs while in a competitive environment. Once you get to plat or higher you cant really practice in normals anymore because the environment is so bronze and you just stomp no matter what you do. I suggest once you hit gold 1 on your main you should make a silver smurf and use that to practice.

As someone who smurfs alot I do see why people hate smurfs, some of them are just there to feel good about themselves by new stomping."

Same as a trike id rather not kill juvies but if I have 2 herds of rexes near me and I see some random ass juvie in the bushes by me that no one in my crew knows, I am not taking the chance."
