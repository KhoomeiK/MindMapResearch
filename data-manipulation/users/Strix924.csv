memes,ffue0ca,t3_ev4ze0,1580239977.0,In high school world history we did a mock trial for ghengis khan. Some Russian (?) leaders were killed in horrifying ways. I remember one was wrapped up in a rug and trampled by horses and another was placed under the top of a table and the mongols danced on top of the table until he was crushed to death. So that does sound pretty horrifying

My AP environmental science teacher gave everyone a radon test kit, which was very nice of him. You put it in your basement for a few days, and then he collected them and sent them to be tested. He was very nice to give me an extra test for my grandparent’s house. My grandpa was diagnosed with lung cancer a year prior but no one smoked in his house. My dad has put the test next to the sub pump in my grandparents basement, which was probably not a good idea, but my grandpa did spend some time down there. His house level was over 80 which was the highest my teacher had ever seen (my house was over 8). You are supposed to have a level under 4. After this we put mitigation systems in and my uncle bought an electric plug in reader (you don’t want to disturb the air too much when testing like opening doors). 

Anyway I’m extremely grateful for my teacher for teaching and providing those kits for us, probably at his own cost. Radon and smoking exposure has a synergistic effect (if together increases risk exponentially), which even though my grandpa never smoked he probably got some second hand smoke from friends in his life. But I’m sure the radon was a big part of his cancer. Lung cancer is a horrible way to go and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy (I also lost my grandma on my other side this way, when my mom was a teenager, and it messed her up real bad)."
