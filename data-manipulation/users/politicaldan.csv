Pete_Buttigieg,ffr0vze,t1_ffqz8ca,1580148009.0,There’s a reason the White House bashes Biden and Pete but nothing Bernie. They want that matchup.
Pete_Buttigieg,ffqyogd,t1_ffqxgfh,1580146609.0,"Maybe I hang around too many conservatives, but I haven’t seen that. Most of what I’m hearing is from former and disgruntled republicans/independents who would vote for any other candidate *but* Bernie."
Pete_Buttigieg,ffqroql,t3_eup619,1580142085.0,"Exactly. This is the golden opportunity that democrats have to attract those disgusted by trump. This can’t happen with Bernie or Warren, because moderates and anti-trump independents are similarly repulsed by them. 

I’ve long said and I’ll say it again for posterity, if Pete wins the nomination, dems win the election handily. If Bernie wins the nomination, trump wins re-election by 5-7 percent because a sizable percentage of the populace will say “well i don’t like trump but at least he’s not an X like Bernie!” Whether or not Bernie is actually an X is irrelevant. It’s that he’s perceived to be by people that could have been persuaded to vote democrat otherwise."

Pete_Buttigieg,fers875,t1_ferpkn4,1579357781.0,"That's thing I hate about this cycle. The further left unify and shore up their support for a single candidate and say ""well moderates will *have* to support us or else they're letting trump win."" It seems Blue No Matter Who only works in one direction. 

But reaching out to try to gain support from independents and conservatives that are disgusted by the Trump administration? No fuck that. Only people who pass our litmus test are allowed in. It seems like the Bernie et al crowd would rather maintain their ideological purity and lose than compromise, reach out, and win."
Pete_Buttigieg,ferkovf,t3_eqg410,1579355143.0,"As a former Republican, I can not tell you how many people I know that have said they would vote for him if he gets the nomination because “he’s the adult in the room.”

These are republicans that know Pete’s stances and positions but still want to vote for him. Pete is the only democrat who has ever been able to present further left policies than Obama or Clinton and actually get republicans to be ok with that. He’s like the cool young pediatrician that convinces kids to get their shots but makes them feel good about about it despite their fears. 

Bernie et al, walk into the room with a horse pill and say “here you little brat, you’re going to take this whether you like it or not because it’s good for you.”"
antiMLM,fep0582,t1_feozb5m,1579309180.0,"Just the general annoyance level. I have a family member on Facebook that sells monat and she probably has ten posts a day about it. If you dare to post anything about how it’s a pyramid scheme or any of the negative effects, she’ll go off on you. In her mind, monat is the greatest thing that has ever existed and anyone who dares question it must be ridiculed into silence. 

From what I’ve seen here and on other forms of social media, there’s quite a few Bernie Bros that have that same level of single-mindedness. I have one friend that has actually stopped being invited to events because every time our circle of friends gets together, he brings information “that you really need to read.” “It will blow your mind.” I’m a political junkie, I get it, but it gets old when you’re constantly being attacked for not supporting one political candidate."

AdviceAnimals,fdbsk4r,t1_fdbokku,1578261327.0,Doubtful. But not relevant. Did either McCain or Hillary or Obama try to start a war to distract the nation from their impeachment? Bernie bros owe the nation a huge apology.
