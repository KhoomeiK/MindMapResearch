worldnews,ff4c4wt,t1_ff3v83h,1579560139.0,Rarely are chances so clear. Also if you are that fucked up not even experimental drug is going to save you. It's like you have 0.15% chance to survive with proven treatment and experimental drug could boost them to 0.60% or lower them to 0.01% and no one knows what it will do.. So why even spend resources and time in such cases?

You can take a medication that actually works and still die, or you can take medication that doesn't work and get cured, so sueing gets hard.  We've already been there as civilization, early industrialization looked like that, regulations were introduced  because they were needed.
