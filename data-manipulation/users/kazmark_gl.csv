RedLetterMedia,fdgfxyo,t1_fdg248x,1578395012.0,"meh, I'd argue that almost all of the star wars films have some deeper stuff going on under the hood. the prequels have some deeper points they are trying to make about politics. Episode 1 is (kinda) about bureaucracy and how rigid systems can fail when stressed. episode 2 seems to be a bridge between ep1's themes and ep3's themes. Episode 3 is very clearly about the Bush era, and tells a cautionary tale about the death of democracy. for all there flaws the new movies also attempted to do this. the force awakens is trying to be about legends and how they inspire, it was just too busy being a soft remake. TLJ (even though it fails in a lot of ways) is about the importance of hero's and how they can inspire us. IMO Rise of Skywalker seems to be trying to tell a story about how you aren't defined by who your ancestors were/are and how anyone can forge their own path. really if the Squels were executed better they had the potential to be very good films."

not really sure why though, might be because most American history classes on high school are really just glorified lead ups to the WW1 unit. it could also be american centric themes present in those classes. 

^1 footnote: an American history class in this context is two classes that a student in the US will normally receive in the middle of high school. the second of which usually takes students from the 1870s to the Reagan or Clinton administrations although most are supposed to end around 2001.
