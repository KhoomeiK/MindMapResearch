Cats are not like dogs - other than designer cats (angoras, sphynx, Maine coon, ect), cats are usually domestic longhair, shorthair or midhair. Even tabby cats and torties are not breeds persay - they're named for their colour pattern but are like other cats.

They have kits online for dogs, around $40, to run genetics and see the breed mixes. You might be able to do the same for cats, if you're really curious, but I doubt you'll get much information."

catbellies,ffena46,t3_et7b4o,1579855601.0,"When ya got it that good, it's a crime not to flaunt it...!"
cats,ffen7e5,t3_et7bpk,1579855491.0,"My first cat was a single, but now I adopted 2 litter mates, and it's a whole different experience. I don't think I'll ever get a single cat again after this.

That being said, my girls were born together, so there was none of the awkward introduction... Cats can be weird about new pets.

Is your cat very playful? Do you find she has excess energy in the evening, being naughty or running around? If this is the case, you might want to consider getting another young cat, so they can play together. But I'd go with a rescue where you can foster for a while before confirming adoption. This way if things don't work out, you can bring back the cat with minimal issues.

If kitty is really more of a couch potato, and doesn't seem to need the stimulation, it's really up to you at this point. Does your cat *need* companionship? Not totally - she has her human(s). But cats can form beautiful bonds and live a great life together - it's just more of a gamble with cats than it is, say, with dogs.

I will say this - while most cats won't just get along with any random animal, they are much more social than people tend to give them credit for... If they get along with their 'family members', cats usually like having the companionship, and will often participate in bonding rituals like grooming each other, playing, laying close or cuddling...

If they get along. If not, it's a bitch, and a lot of hard work to get them coexisting. So really, if we're talking about the couch potato cat, you know your cat best - is she sociable with strangers? Is she confident? Does she freak out if she sees another cat outside, or a dog walks by? Does she even show any interest?

My first cat was super loving with me, but geez she had attitude with strangers. So I didn't feel guilty not having a playmate around for her - she was kind of a grumpy old lady from her teens onward :)"
cats,ffemc9h,t1_ffelb4k,1579854262.0,"Really? No need for antibiotics?

Actually, if she's sneezing out the mucus, sounds like it's starting to clear up. I'd give it a couple more days and see how the wheezing and snot are doing... Of course, depending on how bad her wheezing is now - if she really is having trouble breathing, just take her in."
