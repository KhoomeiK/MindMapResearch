leagueoflegends,ffa4on5,t1_ff9vniw,1579727820.0,"Yeah, I usually pray that the jg or support picks a tank otherwise it’s an auto loss. But what is a Quinn main to do otherwise?"
worldnews,ffa4jt3,t1_ff9zwjg,1579727744.0,"I’m not talking about society affording it, I’m talking about the time required for trash segregation. I live in a small apartment and I can only fit a trash can (which I have to move to use my dishwasher). It is way more efficient for me to throw everything in a single trash bag and call it good because I don’t have the space for a recycling bin for plastic/paper/metal etc..."
politics,ff9q4ge,t1_ff9kqoa,1579718470.0,We need to straight up have a country-wide riot if the popular vote reaches a certain percentage over the electoral candidate winner. I’m not talking 51-49% but rather 55%+
leagueoflegends,ff9pw2o,t1_ff9nhsm,1579718310.0,"I assume so, but it hasn’t happened yet. Just like against teemo or Darius, if Quinn lands a Q the trade is over in her favor... otherwise a smart Quinn won’t vault or be in pull range. Also, vault takes her JUST outside of his W range which is the icing on the cake."
worldnews,ff9gjnz,t1_ff9g6in,1579712542.0,"Yes there are good people. As a whole, we are only as strong as the weakest link. A person is smart, people are dumb. It will never be universally adopted and taken seriously until bigger incentives are added (if that’s even worthwhile in the first place)."
leagueoflegends,ff9fs4g,t1_ff93pn7,1579712075.0,I just play Quinn and force him out of lane. I don’t understand the band.
worldnews,ff9eren,t1_ff9ecyj,1579711445.0,"None. It would have to be reverse free, as in people would have to be paid to do it. Otherwise why would they spend extra time organizing their trash? Obviously the incentive is take care of the planet. Realistically speaking though, we live in capitalism where time is money and people would need bigger incentives to actually recycle. Where I live, even making it a criminal act to not recycle wouldn’t do anything because there is no accountability with community garbage."
worldnews,ff9bsax,t1_ff9ak9c,1579709367.0,They don’t have to care with the inheritance they leave them.
worldnews,ff9ar20,t1_ff95pdd,1579708708.0,"An apocalyptic event WILL happen though one way or another; famine, climate change, dust bowl, nuclear holocaust, mass migration ... take your pick."
worldnews,ff9akpy,t1_ff99kuq,1579708598.0,It’s the Illuminati post-apocalyptic paradise resort selling point free of lower class human kind /s
worldnews,ff9aerk,t1_ff8we0p,1579708496.0,They will be gone long before climate change affects them.
worldnews,ff9a3u7,t3_esbfp1,1579708305.0,It takes insanely too long to decipher what is recyclable in common packaging. Sometimes they tell you (plastic wrapping not recyclable while bottle and seal are). It needs to be more intuitive and unified across products (I.e. all parts of a package made recyclable for easy universal use). Obviously this is only the consumer side of things and a better incentive would help too. I live in an apartment complex; we don’t pay for trash pickup; no one cares about what they throw away because there is no accountability or immediate incentive to do otherwise.
worldnews,ff991zk,t1_ff6lznl,1579707645.0,I live here for 1. The ease of having lab tested product available and 2. The climate. The temperature here never goes below 40 F or above 90 F (Rarely). We are not prone to any natural disasters aside from earthquakes (but we are on the safe side of the fault so we will really only ever get the aftershocks and not full damage). The bay here nullifies any threat of a tsunami as well.
worldnews,ff63rb1,t1_ff60l11,1579618395.0,"Yeah, but then you have to live in Arizona. As a person with Crohn's who uses THC to manage it,  jumping around laws for medical is a pain. I’d rather be in any state that has it legalized recreationally for cheaper, more widely available product. I’m hoping it gets federally legalized in my lifetime."
leagueoflegends,ff3wlvt,t1_ff36rfq,1579550440.0,I read this in Quinn’s voice.
worldnews,ff3w67c,t1_ff3vv6h,1579550171.0,Festival/concert/amusement park goers don’t go to a bar/restaurant and scream at the top of their lungs when they are not at an event either.
worldnews,ff3vjfp,t1_ff3v5jl,1579549777.0,Don’t even remind me.
worldnews,ff3uuef,t1_ff3uf4f,1579549344.0,Maybe it’s the people who pay for it that completely gross me out. $15 hot dogs and $12 beer. Like... why? Just go to a strip club if you want to pay those prices.
worldnews,ff3tj19,t1_ff3ru9u,1579548527.0,Can you believe guys who tackle other guys and throw a ball filled with air get paid 1/10th of a billion?

Guildwars2,fekh37c,t1_fekgtsy,1579199906.0,It is very Korean. It is also f2p with a pay-to-not-grind element. You can do everything without paying though.
Guildwars2,fekfwu9,t1_fek8e0l,1579199204.0,My wife and I started playing BnS.

nextfuckinglevel,feh3ddr,t1_fegzfvh,1579108305.0,Hospital? I’d rather die debt free at home and sue anyone who calls an ambulance against my will.
nextfuckinglevel,feh369q,t1_feh08tt,1579108187.0,Tell me about it. I work over the summer and on school breaks. There are a few months I make too much to qualify for mediCal and I don’t make enough per year to qualify for Covered California. It’s a case of mom telling you to ask dad and dad telling you to ask mom.
settmains,feh1zzw,t1_fegznz6,1579107481.0,"Potentially, yeah. If he maxes W, you probably win from parry. If he maxes Q you might have to outplay him with speedy dashes."
Guildwars2,fegucfu,t1_fee7ewi,1579102721.0,It’s shit that you even need to multi-account to make good gold at all.
settmains,fegu3v0,t1_fegq1x3,1579102569.0,I just played Quinn into him and he couldn’t do anything. Got Jarvan ulted twice and still walked away.

Damnthatsinteresting,fednl06,t1_fedk6mv,1579015855.0,"I have a friend (republican, Christian) who is against universal healthcare because he thinks people who waste their life away doing drugs and being lazy don’t deserve his tax dollars. They also had their education completely paid for by parents."
QuinnMains,feaibgs,t1_fdoj5hi,1578949134.0,"Trust me, this is the easy version. Old runes were semi-p2w and a lot more about min/max-ing."
QuinnMains,feaefif,t1_fe8rc0r,1578947664.0,"If Morde pulls, can you E to him and evade it or do you still get pulled in?"
QuinnMains,feaea8v,t1_fe9qee9,1578947581.0,"Good point. I guess maxing W is against bruisers anyway so against a teemo you wouldn’t need that extra speed to win lane. What do I know though, I max E second usually because I’d rather have guaranteed damage rather than possibly missing my Q (even though Q does more damage maxed)."
