Longer answer; Think [Fukushima](https://i.redd.it/5935436olcl21.jpg), not ""[Tsar Bomba](https://youtu.be/30EoIh2kADk)"".  Nuclear reactor containment vessels are really strong, like [5+ ft of reinforced concrete and steel](https://cdn.allthingsnuclear.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DBD-30-Figure-1-pwr-cutaway-2-NRC.jpg) strong. Other systems however, like the secondary systems that keep everything safe and running smoothly, offsite power, pumps, water and steam lines to and from the turbine and spent fuel pool  are less well protected and would be lost or crtically damaged in the blast. A [Nuclear Generating Station](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/g2w3h7znpyqtirjvpa2g.jpg) consists of a lot more critical sysytems than just the reactor itself, just as in the Fukushima disaster, the secondary systems like fuel pool cooling water or offsite power can be as much of, or more of a problem, than the reactor itself.

Case in point; My friend was an instructor in Ranger School, at the end of one particular long training march track/trail they used there was a hill of several hundred meters, he would tell the company that they had to race him up the hill and if anyone could beat him the company would get the coming saturday off duty, No one ever beat him, or even came close. He ran that hill every day.  (They weren't going to get the saturday off anyway, training doesn't work like that, but the didn't know that)."
