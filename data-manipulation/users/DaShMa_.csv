calculus,ffqaco2,t3_esz8sv,1580128070.0,"Oof, that's hard! I took a precal class this past summer, then calc1 for Fall semester and am now in Calc2. Calc1 was rough, and that was AFTER taking the precalc class. Honestly, I'm still playing catch up in Calc2.

Just keep pushing forward and spend all your free time learning, like you have been. Definitely learn the unit circle and trig functions."
calculus,ffa63rz,t1_ff9p4p0,1579728612.0,I’ll be honest and say I’ve never heard of Wolfram. I’ll check it out and compare but i like Symbolab.
calculus,ff911xp,t1_ff6x0ra,1579702154.0,I gave Symbolab $20 for an annual subscription and have found it to be worth every penny. Does much more than just integrals also.

college,ferpk69,t1_ferlz3x,1579356898.0,That was great info and I can envision almost every bit of it. I’ll sit down in a little bit and draw it all out as I reread to help it materialize in my feeble brain. Thank you for taking tour time to share valuable info!
college,fepjwg0,t1_fepb34y,1579322403.0,"Learn the unit circle like you learned how to feed yourself. I've been out of high school for 23 years and the last subject I took was Trig, but I don't remember anything from high school. For me, I had to completely relearn the Unit Circle, and to be honest I'm still trying to learn it.

Next is to learn Trig Identities, as these are NON-STOP, lol. I still haven't gotten them memorized and the professor is just flying through the content as if everyone already knows these.

Above that it's practice and review. I spend quite a few hours every other week or so on You Tube. Here is [my favorite Calculus 'tutor'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUDlvPp1MlnegYXOXzj7DEQ)

&nbsp;

My last thing I can think of is to try and get your notes and assignments organized so that it makes sense when you go back to review for exams. All last semester for Calc I, I had one spiral notebook with massive amounts of chaotic penciling everywhere, front and back. That was HORRIBLE for exam and final review, which is why I'm here trying to get advise from those who've developed effective systems.

Good luck to you. *Virtual High-Five*"

j/k, i do try and limit the space, but then there are large chunks of blank spaces that aren't large enough for another problem so it's basically wasted..unless I wanted to doodle some cats."
college,fep5xtt,t1_fep4r1r,1579312861.0,"I've gotten close to that. Recently purchased .25mm, .30mm, & .40mm pens, plus a .3mm pencil. I love the thinner linework.

Today, I designed some very faint colored graph paper and printed several sheets and gave my first sheet a run during class today. I definitely like the smaller line weight and faint lines that don't cause too much visual distraction.

Now it's just trying to find effective solving methods... ""Do I work to the right of the page, or do I work down the page? Or, should I use a combination of the two?"""
college,fep303f,t1_fep1e05,1579310989.0,"Specific to Cal II right now, but any similar math would be helpful. I just want to see how others work out their problems in relation to page layout. I just feel like I'm all over the place and I want to nail down a system for myself."

science,fefipch,t1_fef59h0,1579057147.0,"I was something like you a while back. Drank everyday after work and heavy on weekends. Then started smoking weed again and before I knew it I pretty much quit drinking.  But then because I could function I’d stay high all damn day and try to hide the smell and slammed red eyes. It sucked!

So I gave up smoking and went back to drinking. Which I hated. I eventually gave it up too. These days I’m sober and clear minded and I enjoy my life and where it’s headed. I definitely don’t miss any of that stuff."
awfuleverything,fedefzs,t1_feddqgt,1579009254.0,"Ah, gotcha. No, I actually just started taking Adderall about mid-last year. My brain was always all over the place and I wanted it to be more focused so I spoke with my doc and he suggested I give this a whirl. I started out with the base dose of 10mg, and then at one point went up to 20mg to see how that would impact me, but I was like a wired zombie, so to speak. I gave ~5mg a try and it's been perfect."
awfuleverything,fedamw3,t1_fed5em5,1579005831.0,"That’s a lot, at least for me it would be."
awfuleverything,fedalb3,t1_fed5box,1579005789.0,"Well to be technical, I said that’s all I need, meaning anything more than about 5mg is too much for me. There’s a difference in the two needs used here. 

If I don’t take it, there’s nothing catastrophic. If I do take it, then I’m able to focus better throughout my busy days. It’s helpful, but also powerful, and I don’t like getting too much of it."

Good on you for cleaning up! Life is beyond better with a clear mind and focus."

Viewing this photo caused an eruption of empathy and sympathy within my heart. I’m a grown man and I want to cry over an internet stranger. While at the same time, I wish to punch someone who deserves to be punched, because something this bad just makes me angry. I’m angry and sad.

On the real though, I try and give her some time to share with me what she’s into, but after listening to her describe the color of the crime scene in explicit detail and numerous real life examples that she’s for sure I’ll relate it to, and I just lose interest. 

I’m a man. I need the high level, nuts and bolts, franks and beans, black and white overview. If you catch my interest from that, then I’ll be more receptive to the intrinsically detailed crime scheme color illustration. 

I do love her though. Hoping to make it another decade, and then another."
aww,fdy46tt,t1_fdwxg5g,1578775934.0,"Former prisoner here: I agree with your statement concerning at least 50% of the US prison population. Most of us were in prison for doing dumb crap, breaking the law, and getting arrested and convicted. Pure punishment in these instances isn’t really helping them/us learn from our bad choices and lead a healthy, law-abiding life. 

However, there are still a lot of US prisoners who deserve harsh punishment and I’ve spent time with them. I can look back and tell myself that even effective reformation systems wouldn’t benefit those guys. As crappy as it is, some folks just need to be locked away and punished."
