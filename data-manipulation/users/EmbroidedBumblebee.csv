They shouldnt have brought those babies,
if they were responsible they would have left them with a babysitter or something and come to the film without them.

They should have thought of the fact that this is a scary film with a lot of violence and loud noises that will scare the babies and make them cry, disturbing the whole cinema

They probably disturbed everyone else in the cinema and if you weren't going to complain then everyone would have to put up with it too
