I'll give you an upvote for this because wanting a higher quality out of bluetooth sound is a real struggle for a lot of people. 

But, I'll also argue that the mobile listening experience is actually better sans wires. It's really hard for me to go back to wires on my mobile phone at least because I walk around a lot at work/school. Being strapped to a phone through your head is not always the best experience."

I believe that's the reason that Soli feels kinda janky. It's just not designed for the usage in mind.

From what I can tell, the picture taken with the Snapchat app crops in approx 1.5x. That being said, the camera seems to still be taking the HDR photo, but at a slightly cropped angle. Might be contributing to a slightly worse picture. I would honestly always recommend taking your mobile photos with the stock camera app of any phone your using for the best low effort pics. If you need to share them in Snapchat, generally expect them to look worse."
exmormon,fc67jkx,t3_egcsjr,1577474078.0,"When I was in school, I read the entire harry potter series front to back no less than 27 times. I did so because I found continuity, emotion and a writing style that hit me harder than the BoM, or any other book had done before. 

Since then, I have moved to books like The Godfather, the Journal of Marcus Aurelius, and the Tales of Sherlock Holmes. I do so because I was told I could find joy in reading beautiful books that had a deep understanding of the human psyche. Heartfelt and thematically written posts like this help me keep faith in my 'ancient' belief that people still can write from the heart and think critically. *The death of the spirit of discernment was particularly clever IMO.* 

Thank you!"
