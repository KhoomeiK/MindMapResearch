The devs have made it just more likely.

It’s not my opinion it’s just fact, see how many people are moaning about it right now? As soon as the PTS was released loads of posts went up, what the devs have done is increase the issue of teaming by only allowing solos.

I can make it more simple for you to understand,
Imagine if they removed duos and squads from the main game, it would increase teaming an insane amount of friends simply want to play together, it’s basically what they have done, if they don’t want teaming to happen then release it with duos and squads and it would minimise it."
