I figured I'd do a bunch of laps around the campground to blow off steam.  The path around the campground is paved and winds through the trees and I was getting more confident and faster every lap.  Fortunately, it started drizzling rain, so I wasn't overheating as I tried to break my lap record time after time.  
Finally, I overcooked it into a turn, the front wheel slid out and I went over the bars, superman style.  As I slid to a stop, face down on the path, I heard a voice call to me.  ""Are you ok?"".
