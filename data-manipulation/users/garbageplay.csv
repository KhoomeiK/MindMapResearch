ValveIndex,ffj0utm,t1_ffixjtn,1579987557.0,"He's not asking about steam vr mirror. He's asking about resolution of plugged in monitors. Plugged in monitors, even when off, 100% do have an effect on in game fps of steam vr, no matter what resolution you set the mirroring to. you can set mirroring to lowest or even off, and any plugged in monitor will affect fps. You get higher fps if you either A. unplug the monitor or B. (to a lesser extent) downscale the resolution. Most video cards can handle mirroring to 1 monitor, especially ops card. But my 1060 for example, absolutely can not handle vr with 4k as my primary monitor without taking a significant performance hit. (super sampling down to 1.0 or .8 and still droppping to 85-110 fps.) The best option is to turn my resolution down on my 4k monitor, or physically unplug my 4k monitor and just use the 1080p. 

Even using a second 1080p monitor with nothing rendering on it will affect framerate. Not by a lot, maybe 5-10 frames, but ti's enough when you start adding other programs into the mix. 

And the age of the thread is irrelevant. This is an endpoint for a google search result that has some confusing, if not flat out incorrect information. My point is to try to help others get the correct info. See my other reply in this thread for more details about best practices / settings."

Monitors,ffj08cj,t1_ffixy7k,1579987105.0,"It does have render scale, listed at High Quality, Quality, Performance, High Performance, but it doesn't tell you what those do. For example, I have to turn it down to performance or high performance at 4k to even get close to 120fps constantly, but it looks like pixellated trash. 

And if I render at high quality at 1440p it looks great and holds 120fps. Very strange. 

borderless window unfortunately doesn't scale to full screen, so it resizes when I set it to that unless the desktop resolution is the same. what I'm tryin gto get is full screen borderless window 1440p"
ValveIndex,ffiroty,t3_cvm8dm,1579981023.0,"You're getting weird advice here. 

So I ran a whole days worth of testing with a 4k and a 1080p monitor plugged up with beatsaber, LIV, obs, and FPSVR trying to maximize my framerates in beatsaber because I'm getting into expert+ songs now and I absolutely have to have the max while recording. 

Now, in my setup, I have a SECOND monitor. It looks like you might not? This will still apply, for example, if I wanted to just use my 4k monitor and leave my 1080p unplugged to eliminated desk clutter.

What I found is that you have a few options: In decreasing order of effectiveness:

1. Leave as is. Highest fps hit because you are rendering all those pixels
2. Turn off the 2nd monitor, no impact, still takes an fps hit when sending a signal to that monitor.
3. Turn DOWN the resolution of the second monitor (or primary if you only have one) - Significant fps impact if I bring the resolution down to 1080p.
4. UNPLUG the second monitor and leave the 1080p plugged up (see step 3 if you have one monitor) - Highest fps impact. Least amount of pixels being rendered.

Last but not least, run fps benchmarks with your headset plugged up to different ports on your video card. You may find that your Displayport yeilds higher fps than your HDMI in many cases because of the high available bandwidth, especially if you have supersampling turned on."
ValveIndex,ffir6l3,t1_ey4zu2x,1579980665.0,"Actually is a huge performance hit. I just did benchmarks, and even having the 4k monitor plugged in and turned off is a large performance hit.

Hell, I would have kept that forever, but they got bought out by a bigger company and everyone played musical chairs. I was only on short term contract so poof goes that job. I can't say names because the 'musical' city I live in is small and I want to keep my job doors open ;)

Outside of that, senior PM at several software companies, one had an ownership dispute and was dismantled (unlimited PTO, work from home, flex hours, salary, pay was a little low but perks made it up), one straight up ran out of money, another was bought out by a bigger media company on the west coast and I helped transition my entire team's workload to their new software overlords in pakistan. Nice guys, just nice guys doing work at 1/3 our cost. I left the c-level position because, as a non-profit, it paid less than my first job out of college and I want to buy a house. In between, I've left some office jobs for the reasons listed above, usually to go to one of the better jobs. Aka, finish my work in 4-6 hours but be required to sit there for 8, take a lunch, and report to some guy who reports to some other guy who MAYBE has the OLD phone number of the CTO. Not my style. 

At my last software job like that, we literally drove from all over the county, and were issued company laptops with vpns, just to sit in different parts of the office, login to slack and skype, and communicate remotely all day. When we didn't have anything to do we were told to play fooseball or xbox. But we couldn't LEAVE, and log in to skype and slack from anywhere else. It was so backwards I want to barf just thinking about it.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdpinf9,t1_fdpgseo,1578629648.0,"Same age as my younger brothers.  I told them this:

Get a stem degree. Get an office job with flex hrs/remote. Either or both, if you can.  (Software companies actually seem to care about work-life-balance more than most.) 

I got that advice from this uc berkely engineering grad who went by Sakky on collegeconfidential forums years ago. He said, you wanna be a rock star? engineering. Wanna own a business? Engineering with a business minor. You wanna be a chef? Engineering. Then take some fucking cooking classes. 

Basically, unless you have your career path laid out and your heart set (Aka, Doctor, Vet, Financial Analyst, Music Teacher, Off Shore biologist, Any grad study field) then pick any flavor of practical engineering or computer science, and dual major or minor in your interest. Because EVERYONE has to do the grind at some point in their life, and if your ""fall back"", your ""safety net"" when shit goes sideways and you have to run and get the first job available to you is a high paying stem discipline, then you're doing a lot better than most people. ""Awe shucks, I have to go work a boring, high paying, office job while I get my shit together."" vs ""I wonder if amazon is hiring seasonal slaves right now?"". I'm over-simplifying tons of reading and advice, but that's the gist. Major in something practical, persue your passion on the side. If you fail at being a rock star or youtuber, you can still afford a tesla and a jetski.  


The next piece of advice was to then spend your free time trying to either A. monetize your passion, or B. find a fulfilling career to move laterally into (Ie., I really do enjoy c-level operational work to the extent that I could probably do it the rest of my life and be happy. I didn't even know I was that type until I tried it. But I also enjoy making money from creative shit, probably a little more. So there's that. Most stuff in between bores me. It might just be sitting at a desk that bores me. As a field engineer, I pop into different offices a lot rn, and see a lot of bored ass mf people.)  


Lastly,

If you're gonna grind away your days, don't do it for less than 100k, maybe even 150k, or more. Deloitte Management Consulting, or Sachs/Morgan/Stanley Financial Analyst, etc, etc, whatever if the fucking top paying gig in your field is. If your gonna give all your time away. Don't give it cheap. 

(ps a lot of those companies will pay for grad school too.)

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdpcrlm,t1_fdoicbm,1578625357.0,"I've always found this quote backwards af.

Working to live is literally the worst imho. You go to bed at 11pm, you wake up at 7 (or any combination that will maybe get you 8 hours if you're lucky). You get ready for work, take a mandatory hour lunch (unless you're salary, which has it's own problems), then suffer a 30-60 minute commute home (unless you're paying to live close by), by the time you get through the door, 12 hours of your day has gone by.

After you eat dinner with your friends, family, or yourself, and add in bed time stuff, you literally have TWO OR THREE hours to ""live"".

By the weekend you're too exhausted to do the things that interest you, and sunday evening is just prepping to do it all again. Working to live sucks.

If you live to work, you find something that makes you feel alive, that you always want to be doing, and you do that for money, and you never look back.

Mark Twain said, ""Find a job you enjoy and you'll never work a day in your life"". I find that to be a much more realistic quote.

When I was doing photography (may go back here soon) I pulled 12-14 hours day, I was booked out on the weekends, I worked when I woke up and before bed... And I loved. Every. Minute.

When Chief Operating Officer of a local non-profit STEAM organization, I spent 14 hours a day solving problems. I often spent breakfast, lunch, dinner, and many weekends at work. I was there for every board meeting, every city council meeting, every open house, every community meeting and didn't mind one bit. Four years of my life flew by in a flurry of helping empower others.

In both cases, if I needed to take a day or two off for family, I just did it. That's the trade off for working so hard at something you love.

Now I'm back in contract IT work. From the moment I wake up until the moment I get home is about 10-12 hours. And I have about 3-4 hours to myself.

if I recall correctly that comment may have been the one saying that they did a sleep study and found out they had something like 30 micro wakes per hour during their lightest stage of REM sleep in the last 2 hours of their night. And a telltale sign of that being not having dreams, or not being in REM sleep long enough to have dreams. 

Which is why waking up after 6 hours feels more refreshing been waking up after 8, because of something to do with the microwave cakes and dreams I think I can't remember. 

I personally have been using melatonin a lot since then and I have to be very careful with it and make sure to take it 2 to 4 hours before bedtime because it seems to stay in my system for 12 to 15 hours and make me groggy in the morning. But even with melatonin I feel like I'm noticing myself tossing and turning and waking up a lot in the last 90 to 120 minutes of sleep. If I just cut that section of sleep out and wake up after 6 to 6 and 1/2 hours naturally I feel pretty great, but I have to do a catch up day once every four days - five or so.

I'm using voice to text so don't mind the errors I hope this captures everything. I'll be signing up for a sleep study and potentially surgery as soon as my insurance kicks in"

So if I think of it in daily terms, there would be periods of time I'm putting away 100% of my income, or even more, for days or even a week or more straight. That wouldn't make sense on paper. On salary, I actually used to budget how much in could spend daily after all expenses and retirement contributions. It's just a fixed number that doesn't change as long as I show up to work.

I could budget monthly as a contractor though, for at least, well some, maybe most, months out of the year."

Can you elaborate on what part isn't true?

>Getting a lot of views at the beginning makes it more likely that your video will be more recommended.

u/mylackey, this part of what u/sponge_hitler says is 100% true. If you get a couple hundred to a couple thousand views within a certain unknown time period on your video, you'll show up in the recommended feed.

There are other ways to get recommended. I had one video with like 8 views a month and then some search term hit after a fight and youtube yeeted out 10k views over night.

Since then it does like 5k views a month through recommended.

Are YOU a brand? Can you monetize yourself and will you make more money if people know your name? Then brand your name. 

If not, brand a wordplay of your name. That's the next best.

Go for the brand name like RTGames **very** last, as this will fade / change direction as you do, but you're (mostly) stuck with your name, so it won't. 

Lastly, if you are good, then whatever name you pick won't matter in at all. Look at  xQcOW  for example. Or better yet, go to /r/tiktokcringe and look at the ridiculous usernames with millions of views. They just left all their fucks at the door."
