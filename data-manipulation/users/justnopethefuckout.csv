AskReddit,ffjh52b,t3_ett7fr,1579998123.0,"I'm not sure if this counts or not since I didn't have much control over it. My mother doesn't like most doctors or medication. I've known for a long time that I needed some help mentally and psychically. I was able to go to a psychiatrist once while underage. She scared me so bad from talking and never let me go back again. Back to my point. Since I was never able to get the treatment I needed some of my health issues got worse and caused me a lot of problems. I didn't realize how bad everything was until these past few years and still going on. I tried working through everything, but too many surgeries, being down from being sick, medication changes, mental health problems, I wasn't able to anymore. I really hope this changes some day. I hope I'm able to get stable enough to do some type of work.

An unexpected thing I found out a few days ago. My vocal cords have been damaged for a long time. I always told my mom that it hurt when I tried to speak up or speak loudly, she didn't believe me. My voice goes out daily unless I avoid talking much and at a low tone. Now when I'm having my tonsils removed, also a problem that has been bad, I have to get some type of injection. I won't be able to speak for 2-4 weeks. If the injection doesn't fix the issue, they have to go back in and do surgery. The voice issue actually caused me a lot of problems at my old job. Being able to speak loud and clearly was needed.

I'm thankful to finally be getting treatment for my mental and psychical health, but I wish I would've been able to get the help and answers I needed when I was younger. Maybe it wouldn't be as bad now."

Although sometimes I wonder about my dog. If the neighbors are being loud and I say, tell them to be quiet bub, he barks and huffs towards the door.

medical_advice,ff33np0,t3_ere8p3,1579532851.0,"If you're afraid of talking to your doctor, I'd recommend changing. My previous psychiatrist had me on so many medications and I was a complete mess. It was like she didn't even care about me at all. She had me taking 20 some pills a day. I finally got it together and left her. My current doctor is amazing and so caring. I'm never afraid to ask her questions or be honest with her. She doesn't just write me a new prescription or change it either. The few times we've had to she always ask me first, ask how I feel about it, and ask me if I have any questions. Then she always tells me to call her if I have any questions or concerns.

Now the medications you're taking I haven't heard of and I'm sorry I'm not much help with those. However, I do take two medications for my depression and anxiety. I have ptsd and things get extreme for me. I wasn't always taking two until a few months back. Have you been taking these medications for very long?"

TooAfraidToAsk,ff3251p,t3_erc31s,1579531692.0,"I'm not sure why some people called you homophobic or transphobic. You can ask a question without it meaning that and that's what you've done. I honestly don't care. It's their life and they're happy, that's all that matters. 

Now, here is where some people might get pissed with me, but it's my opinion. I don't agree with parents letting their underage children start the transition of changing their body. I think they are too young and still growing. I'm not saying don't support them, but they need to grow some and do that when they're an adult. If and when they decide they still want that, support them.

I also don't believe in changing that part of our body due to religious beliefs. But again, if that person is happy that's all that matters. It's their body and people should leave them alone. Just because we don't agree with certain things or we wouldn't personally do it, doesn't make the other person bad. We all need to be loved and love each other. I think most people here know that, but the media and other sources make it seem like we don't.

Edit: I wanted to add that just because I may not believe in changing certain parts of the body or changing it while underage, I would always support someone if they told me or came to me for help. Everyone deserve to be happy and have someone to support them. If anyone is feeling alone and needs someone to talk to, message me. I'm here for you."
