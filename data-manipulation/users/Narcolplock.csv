news,fffk7cr,t1_fffjh0b,1579885743.0,I gave it a lot of thought and I agree with you. It doesn't need any other association. LAW ENFORCEMENT is scummy enough.

bouldering,ffesq4g,t3_et5buy,1579863729.0,"I hate how thin some of the materials are for higher end climbing pants.

I paid $145 or so for some quality Prana pants, and can pay $126 for e9s that pale in comparison.  They might be cool styles but thats not nearly as important. 

Second, everything that comes from China is pretty much worse than any alternative. That goes for La Sportiva, Butora, Scarpa, really all brands. 

Some are made authentically in Italy, Spain, Germany etc... but the items that aren't are clearly lower quality.

It is unavoidable, brands will make cheaper options and so China is their friend, but emerging brands and superior articles should be from better more regulated sources. 

Quality is key."

At least district wide our prices for trade-ins were never greater than the purchase price of a system.

The District Managers I worked under would have been all over this.

Gamestop is really good at transferring unsold product to places where it will move or is in higher demand.

Something is amiss here. 
Unless the company is trying to liquidate....

Pretty sure they aren't going under any time soon.

I've closed Gamestop stores as well. We shiped everything out. EVERYTHING."

I'm in no position to offer advice. Only understanding.

Sometimes it seems, we weren't meant to be with who we've given our hearts to.

Forever isn't the same for everyone.

Even if you can convince yourself that she just doesn't care as much, it's still inconceivable to move past her.

She's is everything to me.
