If you find yourself doing bare minimum, try to establish a very high minimum that you should at least do. Or depending on your major and career goals, try to work hard to achieve that. For me, I’m an engineering major; if an engineer fucks up by doing bare minimum, people aren’t going to be happy. I have to go above and beyond to keep going towards my career goals. 

The way I see procrastination and bare-minimum effort is kinda like if I saw a professor half-ass teaching and not giving a fuck about their students and putting grades late consistently.

With big group projects, the most important thing is communication, and it is important to get everyone else to communicate so that the project will flow smoothly. Do not be afraid to call out others for being lazy.

Just a few unrelated cents: if your interest in CS more geared towards low level programming or higher level programming, because if your interest is the former, consider doing an EE degree. There’s a big subfield of EE called computer engineering that consists of low level programming and hardware design.

With vs, you can run a whole host of programming languages that are taught in cs curriculums, like python, C, C++, C#, and SQL. 

But generally, you’d only need a laptop that can run engineering applications, like matlab, java, C/C++, and other microsoft VS languages. 

I’m not sure if UT Austin teaches matlab to undergrad cs students, but if you were to switch to Electrical Engineering, having that matlab capability is really helpful as a large portion of EE utilizes matlab code.

college,ff0ucq9,t3_er0jsb,1579472389.0,"From what I’ve been told, only having a BA or BS in physics doesn’t really lend itself towards job prospects. However, because physics is such a complex and tough field, the degree does prepare you to branch elsewhere in stem. I’ve seen a lot of physics majors branch towards CS and software jobs. 

If you were to stick with physics, the real lender to jobs is the masters degree in physics, where you can get into research positions. However, this career path does tend to land you strictly into academia, which is a lot of work for mediocre pay.

Another option is to go towards engineering in grad school. The physics degree lends itself well to branch into a MS in Electrical Engineering, Materials Science, or Mechanical Engineering, where you’d focus on the application of physics in engineering systems."
