Some examples of executable files are .exe .bat .vbs .msi 
  .com there are few other I'm probably forgetting, look them up



You'll also need to change your windows settings to display extensions even for known file types as viruses will often disguise an executable file as a folder or as a pdf or image file

If in doubt, use a sandbox first, if you're handling corporate data then don't trust any executables other than those provided by the company 


That will protect you from 95 % of viruses"
