BorderCollie,ffy4ihm,t3_evo9ux,1580338395.0,"My male intact bc is 3 and acts like this sometimes when he doesn't get enough exercise or stimulation. 

I would start by taking her for some exercise. You mentioned in another comment the weather is bad. I'm from Canada so I understand this. What I do when it's super cold is set up jumps around my kitchen island and chase him around in a circle while he does the jumps. Doing this for 10 minutes exhausts my dog. Another method is throwing a ball down a flight of stairs and making him run back up. Also very effective but only works on carpeted stairs. 

For mental stimulation, I get some treats and make my dog do all his many tricks. This keeps his little mind occupied but also reinforces obedience. Teaching your dog a new trick is also a really great way to get her little brain working and reinforce obedience. Google some advanced tricks on YouTube. The fetching a beer from the fridge trick is my favourite. I also taught my dog to turn lights on and off, close doors, retrieve different items, and 'go see' different people in my house. Once I get my own place, I plan to teach him to put stuff in the recycling bin. I'm looking forward to that one because I recycle a lot.

Edit: umm why am I getting downvoted for being helpful? Weirdos."
23andme,ffxqjtt,t3_evl4bc,1580330444.0,I love that so many First Nations people are posting on here lately.
23andme,ffxqbpe,t1_ffxct4j,1580330319.0,"This is true. Europeans have been marrying (or in some cases raping) Indigenous women since the 1600s in Canada. The majority of First Nations people, even if they don't have any recent European ancestors, will have a sizeable chunk of European DNA. I'm partly native, so I'm connected with a bunch of FN people on 23andme, and I haven't seen any that don't have at least 20% European DNA. It is probably different for Inuit people though, they were much more secluded than other FN's in Canada."

23andme,ffe5uk2,t1_ff1z4h8,1579837494.0,"They were pretty off for my brother too, around half of his were wrong. But my mom's were almost 100% accurate. I think that some people just have genes for things that aren't expressed. For example, half of my siblings hate cilantro, but both my parents like it. So we got the gene from one or both of them, but for some reason it didn't affect them. 

There was one trait that was super off... it said i likely have a lot of freckles. I have no freckles whatsoever.  But many people on my dad's side including my dad have freckles, so maybe I have those genes somewhere. Idk, I honestly have no idea how this stuff works."
23andme,ffe54o7,t1_ff7qew6,1579836949.0,"That is really interesting about the cholesterol and lipids, hopefully that's the only problem that comes of those genes because Alzheimer's is pretty awful!"

relationships,ff4jjfg,t1_ff48qn8,1579565138.0,This is exactly what I was thinking. It was probably the OM who told them about op and the manager's relationship
relationships,ff4jd3o,t3_erhaf3,1579565011.0,"They likely found out about your connection to the manager, and have created some kind of story in their head that you got gifted the job and are not actually qualified to be there. They might also see you as someone who can't be trusted because of your relationship with the manager. 

This exact same scenario played out in my office, which is also all women. The manager hired her niece. one person knew about it, and then within a day the whole office knew. No one talked to the new girl or tried to befriend her, and they all talked trash behind her back."
insomnia,ff4dwur,t3_erdm91,1579561307.0,"You take all 3?? Bro... please look up the long term effects of benzodiazepines and addiction. Those drugs will not help you long-term, they'll make your insomnia worse and create even more problems. I'm shocked a doctor prescribed you all 3."

TwoXChromosomes,fem2o6f,t3_eptgvy,1579237760.0,"Sentencing for sexual assault and rape is ridiculously light, not just in this case but all of them. It's such an insult to victims."
relationships,felfuta,t3_eppbj3,1579221192.0,"Your husband is being a bit selfish to expect you to accept an uncomfortable living situation just so the grandparents can be a bit closer. I would try to negotiate a visiting schedule instead. You can suggest spending a weekend there once a month, and they spend a weekend at your place once a month. So they would see the grandkids 2 weekends a month. 

Is it normal for grandparents to see their grandkids more than that? It might be  because I come from a large family... but I think your inlaws are expecting too much. My mom is a 2.5 hour drive from her grandkids and she does the drive every 1-2 months for a weekend visit.

Also 1 hour isn't even a long drive, it takes me almost an hour to drive from one side of Calgary to the other! They could come for day visits easily."

politics,fel2pzr,t1_fekslyv,1579212779.0,"Hahah this actually makes me laugh. It's sad how Americans are brainwashed with this information to scare them out of wanting universal healthcare. I've never heard of this in all my life as a Canadian. I've lived in different cities and never experienced excessively long wait times for serious ailments. All the people I know are Canadian and I will occasionally hear a complaint about wait-times, but it really isn't that bad. If you have a serious problem, you will be prioritized and seen quickly."
TwoXChromosomes,fekjne4,t1_fekdz82,1579201436.0,Wow it's sad you have nothing better to do than troll women's forums. You're probably an incel and this is the only female contact you ever get.
dogs,fekj3aw,t1_fekaiga,1579201100.0,"This is exactly what I was thinking. I have a border collie as well, they need soooo much mental stimulation and exercise or they start to act out. They also need a lot of socialization with other dogs as pups, which I'm assuming didn't happen for this aggressive border collie."
dogs,feki5go,t3_epi99u,1579200538.0,"My family had an extremely aggressive dog, but she was only ten pounds so she never caused serious damage. The final straw was when she bit my baby sister. We were going to put her down but a family friend who was a dog trainer decided to take her. The trainer worked her magic and transformed that vicious beast into a well-mannered dog. 

It takes a lot of time, energy, and knowledge to train an aggressive dog. Perhaps consider putting an ad out explaining the dog's aggression and see if any trainers would be interested in taking him."

insomnia,feiak35,t1_fei7w1t,1579133995.0,"I tried it but it made matters worse for me. I've heard it helps some people though. In my case, my insomnia was very severe and I was barely functioning as it was, so I couldn't go through with it."
insomnia,fei4ewr,t3_ep6ez8,1579130042.0,"Most of the meds you listed are hit and miss. Seroquel seems to work for most people, maybe try that. Warning that it's not a fun drug to be on long-term but can help you get into a better sleep routine.

When I had severe insomnia for a year, what helped me was jogging for 30 minutes during the day, taking an omega 3, vitamin d, and iron (i was low in d and iron). Eating full meals with healthy fats and carbs (I ate potatoes and fish a lot), doing guided meditation (headspace app), taking a hot bath in the evening, making my room cold before bed, wearing compression stockings (I have RLS and it helps so much), and drinking decaf green tea in the evening. 

Stress is the root of most chronic insomnia so try to do things that calm you down. I stuck with the above routine and after a week my sleep slowly returned to normal. Fixing chronic insomnia won't be quick, but you can do it! 

I'm currently not on any meds, sleeping 8 hours a night on average. When I don't do my routine, I notice my sleep gets messed up again."
dogs,fehcmha,t3_ep51hq,1579113804.0,"It took me over six months to bond with my dog when he was a puppy. I find the puppy stage to be very exhausting, and my dog didn't really show his personality at first. He was just a typical high energy dumb little puppy, and he wasn't affectionate at all. He's 3 now and he's like my kid, I love him more than most humans. He's also a lot more affectionate and seems to like me too. I was worried about not bonding with him at first, but then I did some online research and found that it's common for people to not be able to bond with puppies. I wouldn't worry too much.
