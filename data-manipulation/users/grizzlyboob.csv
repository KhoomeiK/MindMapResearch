SelfAwarewolves,felvkif,t3_eplozf,1579232017.0,I am not saying it’s not true. It’s funny because to be a Trump supporter and to say we don’t need a Hollywood entertainer when he is backing one. The people didn’t elect trump the EC did.

SelfAwarewolves,felo1jx,t1_fell8li,1579226778.0,"I don’t disagree with the post. We do put entertainers on a pedestal but in one way or another we use them for an escape. Some examples were given to me in this post was how music has helped them and it is true, I myself have needed a certain song to help me get through something.  So where as the post itself I do agree with because those are a difference of wants and needs. 
 I am a Bernie fan his support for teachers and education and everything else has me wanting to be able to say my president with pride again.
My friend is a Trump supporter we have very opposing views on him as a president. I think this post talking about how he doesn’t want those things but in reality Trump is all those things (except athlete) he is talking about.
I have continued to stay friends with him almost 20 years. I don’t feel the need to share
the same political views as my friends or coworkers or family but I will listen to reason and facts. Seeing my friends page trashing Greta, talking about how great the militia uprising in Virginia is, pro trump and so on and then seeing this made me actually laugh out loud just with the hypocrisy of the statement.
But I use the word friend because he is, not my acquaintance not a coworker he is a genuine friend I care about, but I also enjoy to poke the bear on some of his posts.
