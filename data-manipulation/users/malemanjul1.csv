Cebu,ff4lybb,t3_er7f0h,1579566817.0,When will LTFRB be illegal? cant wait. They are useless. a waste of tax money.
Cebu,ff4lgup,t1_ff4kay6,1579566483.0,"Of course, government is the problem here. We cant even fire incompetents, and we're paying for their salaries. To say the least, government is just a paid steward to protect or safeguard our freedoms to do what we want to do (as long it doesnt harm anyone). Solving our own problems is an example like Taxi,Ride hailing apps. In fact, its doing them favor. It has no authority to dictate. LTFRB is just trying hard to relevant. In fact, they're just useless bureaucrats. a waste of tax money."
