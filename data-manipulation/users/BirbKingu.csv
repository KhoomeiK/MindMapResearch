wow,ffg1jgd,t1_ffda5fb,1579896447.0,Same tbh. Leveling throught dungeons with my highmountain at the moment with a bunch of fluff balls has been kind of funny.
postrock,fffs1t7,t3_et9js6,1579890557.0,Already AOTY for me.
COMPLETEANARCHY,ff4oilj,t3_ereh1f,1579568626.0,"These few clowns are allowed to do this kind of parade in paris streets meanwhile anti riots force and cops have been killing, mutilating and emprisoning people for way less these last few years. This shit is just infuriating."
COMPLETEANARCHY,ff4nn4v,t1_ff44duy,1579568008.0,Fortunately they are almost extinct in France though.
postrock,fenjsqq,t3_eq0smu,1579286213.0,"Blood Pact is just too good, stuck in repeat for now ahah"
AskReddit,fel7jde,t1_fejxw3k,1579215747.0,Usually this is not my kind of game but the soundtrack damn... One of the best I've heard in a game.
Gamingcirclejerk,fdmz6vt,t3_elzrmd,1578572131.0,"Can't wait for twitter and YT to deplatform/invisibilize these people similarly to Reddit, mostly confined in their quarantined echo chamber like cockroaches yikes."
sffpc,fdk9j1m,t3_elacgl,1578499134.0,Looks great. Loved mine but routing the stock cables was a nightmare.
sffpc,fdk5y4u,t3_elt0zq,1578496821.0,Classy/clean as fuck without being ostentatious. Love it
AmateurRoomPorn,fd6cq90,t1_fd4mkyd,1578188972.0,"Not op but this is an Ibanez tmb100, love this bass."
ambientmusic,fd2sbt0,t3_ejwf7x,1578151203.0,Absolutely love it. Reminds me of the early Her Name Is Calla material.
SuicideWatch,fd2hgjv,t3_ejtios,1578147289.0,"I'm lucky I found small things to keep my mind a bit clearer when intrusive thoughts are trying to take over. It depends on the person I guess, to me I don't have enough money to travel and shit and probably won't anytime soon, and i'm too boring or socially inept to meet and talk to random people so I started cycling and going for night walks, and there's a few stupid things that I don't want to miss in the really near future, like a game release or some music. Most of the time it feels like it's just temporary or not enough but It would keep me going for another week or two."
dontyouknowwhoiam,fd13mhk,t1_fd0ighh,1578127161.0,Why ? Genuinely asking since I'm not familiar with this person.
Gamingcirclejerk,fcwv7p7,t3_ej5ps2,1578038991.0,Kinda cringe imo. There is so much shit to laugh at in the pcmasterrace dumpster fire but op decided to use the low hanging fruit fatshaming joke.
sffpc,fcwubg5,t3_ei8na2,1578037931.0,"Oh just noticed it was brickless. I wanted to get the hdplex combo if I choose this case, would it be possible to get some pics inside of the case ? And how/where did you put the hdplex brick ? Is it getting hot when used ? (Some dude on pcpartpicker had his almost overheating because too close to his gpu or something like that)"
SuicideWatch,fcphloz,t3_eiaipw,1577864439.0,Conveniently exhausted myself the last few days so I could fall asleep early on the New year eve. It worked but this morning still suck anyway.
sffpc,fcnpvm2,t3_eh8otm,1577816192.0,"Almost got one few month ago, easily the best looking case i have ever seen. Too bad LP gpu are scarce."
sffpc,fcnorn3,t3_ei4axj,1577815560.0,I'd buy that tbh. I've been searching for a case for a similar build but with a pico psu or dynamo mini ! + I love acrylic damn
MechanicalKeyboards,fcma0g0,t3_ehq4dn,1577768304.0,Ok so I really need to know where you got that ditto cable holder ahah
sffpc,fcjuwgv,t3_ehj1gy,1577705932.0,How was the case before the hole on the bottom ? I've been wanting to get one for a long time but I don't know if it's worth it without modding it. I would throw a 1660 super in there.
SuicideWatch,fc7ceab,t3_egjajx,1577503333.0,Yeah pretty much the same. I guess for some of us it's just not getting better even if we try.
