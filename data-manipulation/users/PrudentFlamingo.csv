But when the government was siezing land under eminant domain, where was the armed resistance? When cops roll through neighbourhoods shooting and assaulting unarmed civilians, where was the resistance? When they lock up and half a million people on drug charges to provide free labour for the prison industrial complex, where was the armed resistance? When big businesses buy politicians to enact favourable laws that hurt the environment and the working man, where was the armed resistance? 

At what point do people say enough and enough, and put their lives on the line to defend their ACTUAL freedoms, when those that do are killed or imprisoned? You don't know what unspeakable shit you would have to do with your gun, before the government pays the slightest amount of attention. And to be honest, 99.999% of gun owners wouldn't have the stomach for it. 

Ask yourself this, how does a smaller and poorly equipped fighting force without artillery, air support, armour, drones, supply lines, and all the other  miscellaneous rear echellon support mount an armed opposition against the most powerful fighting force in all of human history?

Until then, these arguments about guns being used to protect rights and freedoms is just masturbation.

The police is an instrument of the state that is used to enforce control of the population. You freedom fetishists are essentially calling for cop killing. Or do you think the people that come to take you to the gulags will be faceless foreign invaders?

You lost your freedom a long time ago, you were too busy polishing your guns to realise it.
