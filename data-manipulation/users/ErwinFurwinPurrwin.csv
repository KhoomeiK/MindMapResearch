AnythingGoesNews,fgvwpqw,t1_fgvwfh4,1581154027.0,"Yep. People jump the gun all the time, especially on hot button issues. No harm done. Enjoy your evening, too."
AnythingGoesNews,fgvvysu,t1_fgvvce4,1581153663.0,That's the problem with assuming. It's a lot safer to just take a post at face value.
AnythingGoesNews,fgvuqt5,t1_fgvuo5j,1581153268.0,Did I say that?
AnythingGoesNews,fgvu2g9,t1_fgvts84,1581153015.0,"As long as there is a bias, it's agenda pushing, which is all I said about the OP."

freewill,fgvfkn7,t1_fgvf274,1581148151.0,">We are selecting a preferred way of functioning for our minds here, not searching for a 'correct' answer. 

I would hesitate to use the collective ""we"" because that would presume that one is in a position to represent everyone. It seems to me that there are quite a few members of this sub who are indeed very interested in finding the most correct answer possible, regardless of other consequences.

>Both positions can be held simultaneously without contradictions.

I would need to see that demonstrated. If there is no law of non-contradiction, then the earth is equally both flat and spherical, as both claims would be equipollent. How can both free will and no free will simultaneously be true?"
AnythingGoesNews,fgvcu3z,t1_fgv4z9p,1581144892.0,OP likes to post things that appear to justify his racism. Just so you know.

freewill,fgub17t,t1_fgtavyl,1581116505.0,"There's too much reification in that for my taste, I'm afraid. Within this context, the point is to figure out as best as we can what is correct, not what is useful or gives us comfort. I do sympathize with the pragmatic approach and do use it to navigate daily life; it's just a different context."
EngagedBuddhism,fgssg2u,t3_f0btk4,1581091689.0,"Excellent! Thanks for this, OP! It will be the discussion topic next week for the monks I'm teaching."
POLITIC,fgsrrrl,t1_fgsr2ye,1581091273.0,"Running to try to hide from the fact that you're a poor, hateful, hypocritical, fake Christian cracker? Already? Hmm. That's par for the course. I didn't actually expect anything better, tbh. You won't succeed because deep down you know you're actually reading this; you know what you are."
POLITIC,fgsqsdb,t1_fgspxy2,1581090668.0,"Why were you so desperate for my attention that you replied to me first, fake Christian? Derp. Why are you so happy to defy Jesus? It's almost as if you aren't actually interested in being a good person. You know, so you can get to go to that heaven you pretend to believe in? ;)

Edit: I notice that you're trying to clean up your posts now that you've been called to God's carpet. *cough* What's the definition of ""hypocrite"" again?"
POLITIC,fgspt8r,t1_fgsow3z,1581090059.0,"You obviously didn't or couldn't read Jesus' own words. How do you plan to get through the eye of a needle, ""rich man"" hypocritical cracker? Worshipping mammon above God. Hitting all the low points..."
POLITIC,fgsortc,t1_fgso81c,1581089409.0,"Read: I'm OK with being a hypocrite because I've been tricked into thinking that I might one day become rich if I kiss the rich people's asses long enough.

Edit: Your type are downvoting the words of Jesus. Think about that."
