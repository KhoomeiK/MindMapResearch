When I was first learning to change diapers (I wasn't part of the picture when my eldest was born, so I didn't know how to change diapers until my middle was born), my kid was understandably upset.  One time when he was particularly loud, Lovey came barreling down the hall, thumped into the wall as she turned the corner, ran into the bedroom, jumped (and cleared) the bed in a single bound, stuck the landing, and then put her front paws on the bassinet/crib to peer in.

personalfinance,fddn7y3,t1_fdcwzs6,1578318449.0,"I have a funny-in-retrospect story about how a credit union can be \*too\* helpful.

So, my idiot older dog had swallowed a dishrag, and had gone septic.  Vet ER's are expensive, so I wrote a check to cover the balance at the time, and sent a tax refund check (for my wife & I) to my credit union (no local branches, I don't live where I went to college, but I've stuck with them for almost 30 years now) via FedEx.  My credit union is very good with processing deposits immediately, I've on occasion written checks that relied on FedEx delivering the check on time.

I look at my checking account balance the next day, and it hasn't gone up to the expected amount.  I call my bank, and the deposit was rejected because my wife (who was on the check, and had endorsed it) wasn't on the account, and they were sending the check back via certified mail.

Refusing the deposit put me in a world of hurt, because I knew that the check would bounce, even with the overdraft protection I have, as it would put me $700 in the hole after the overdraft protection maxxed out.  So, my wife & I cut another check from a different account to the ER vet to cover the balance (to keep us on the vet ER's nice list), since I knew the original check I wrote would bounce.  (Since we were going to pains to make sure that they were paid, the vet ER promised to not count the NSF against us after the necessary fee was charged.)

Well, my bank \*did\* honor my check, and I now had a negative balance of $700.  

I didn't yell at them, because honestly, you don't yell at someone voluntarily loaning you money without a contract binding them to.  I probably should have put a stop payment on the check, but figured it would bounce anyway.  (The bounce would not have been particularly harmful, since the last time I bounced a check had been 13 years prior.)

* The hook off a suction cup, extracted via surgery.
* A wooden crucifix made of matchsticks owned by my wife.  Fortunately, she didn't swallow the splinters.
* She chewed on (but fortunately didn't swallow) an empty insulin syringe when I was still with my ex-wife.
* A dishrag.  Which caused a major slowdown in her GI tract, opening a GI bleed (that didn't require surgery to fix), but did cause the aforementioned sepsis.  Had she gotten to the ER vet 12 hours later, we would have been short one dog.  10 days after she was knocking on death's door, her regular vet remarked that Lovey was pretty spry for a dog that had been septic.
* Her own poop.
* The other dog's poop.  Including the toy he ate that passed right through.  Lovey wasn't so lucky, the toy blocked her pyloric sphincter for a couple days, causing pancreatitis, until she upchucked the whole mess into the back of my car.  Worst thing I've ever smelled, and that includes the kids' diapers.
* The cats' poop.
* Deer poop.  She is sad that she doesn't see deer any more.
* At the age of 12, she ate a sock.  We didn't realize that she ate the damn thing until she gave it back.  She set a record at the vet's office for ""Oldest Dog To Eat A Sock""
* Tampons.  Unused.
* Tissues.  Used only.
* Napkins.
* My kid's homework.  The teacher declined the offer to bring the homework in after it passed through the dog.
* A cat toy that the cat knocked onto the floor.  Removed via endoscopy, along with a host of other taste treats.
