pcgaming,ffbfcbo,t1_ffbbsxl,1579762837.0,"Except that there's actually a lot more competition in the laptop market than the soft drink market. Coka cola (including all their products) controls a whopping 50% of all non alchoholic beverage market while HP only control around 25% of the laptop market.

Asus priced it $1700 based on their competitors' pricing and expected sales from historical data. And the fact that they drop prices so fast shows that the laptop market is highly competitive. Why would you spend $1700 for a laptop with outdated specs when you can spend $1700 on one of their competitors' new releases with better specs?

You can also buy the last year's model for much cheaper but guess what? Turns out people are willing to pay a few hundred premium for the newest stuff. All tech products depreciate fast as hell but the market don't care."

Comparing laptop prices to desktop component is comparing apples to oranges. 

Why eat at a restaurant for more money if you can just buy all the food and cook at home? Why buy a house when you can just build one yourself on empty land for cheaper?"

Use the mouse however you feel is comfortable. A lot of people including me don't find any ""pure"" form of grip to be the best. 

Basically, find (or create) a grip that is consistantly comfortable for you and practice aiming with it. Don't practice aiming for any specific grip style because you shouldn't be thinking about your grip, only your aim."

My general rule is that I'm willing to sacrifice graphics until I get 90+ fps. After that, diminishing returns for fps kicks in. Don't get me wrong, 144 is a treat but I'd rather have better texture/lighting above 90 fps.
