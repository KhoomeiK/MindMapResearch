Old people not dying fast enough (yet) and the properties they owned are either:

2) in old-folks communities 55 and over, so these golf course sized, gated mini-villages are completely unavailable to families with children

3) shitty flips with oil heat and aluminum wiring, so you get a dangerous-as-fuck 70's house for 2020 prices because the market will bear it

My posts probably speak for themselves, but Buell was a Harley subsidiary making sport / racing motorcycles using Harley engines with custom heads (among other trick bits).

[Buell was a powerhouse of innovation and weirdness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buell_Motorcycle_Company#Technology) that made his bikes instantly recognizable in the seas of chrome and plastic.

| It is also important that we all keep to the facts and keep calm.

That's all I need to hear to start thinking the shutdown is a planned distraction or an outright scam.  What else might be suspicious here?

For starters, why are you telling people to ""keep to the facts"" when you literally just told them everything they know about the situation *just now* -- unless it was to deflect other sources of information?

Then... sitting on the information and waiting 2 months to tell everyone they're unemployed?  Dropping the bomb exactly at the end of the year, right before New Year's day??

Then she keeps repeating ""...getting our systems running again"".  What has everyone been doing for the last 2 months with no ""systems""?  The purpose of a fundraising company is to make phone calls, send emails, mail out envelopes and bring in money.  Of course there are administrative and support staff here and there. 
 Can anyone fill in the blank here?  Did she just lay off 300 productive people, doing what they've been doing to bring in money for decades?  Or did a CEO of a 60 year old, billion-dollar company just kill off the only method of production in her company?

Think about it.  If the staff has been doing nothing for 2 months, then the alarms should have gone up long ago.  BUT if they've been working and bringing in dollars, they would have been offsetting the (unknown) ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" the company lost.
