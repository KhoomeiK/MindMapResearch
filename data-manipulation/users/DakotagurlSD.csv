I still had to take another math class..the horror ...my tutor recommended that I take 'Quantitative Literacy"" which is like loans, mortgages, some geometry stuff, I dunno how but i found it alot easier, maybe the patterns and puzzles of it ? got a  ""B"" in it

Look into different types of math classes

college,ffavpbp,t3_es68ju,1579745582.0,"..wut ????

ok that sounds like some bull right there lol

I was a 2.1 highschool dropout with a GED and I still got into college double majoring in history and native american history. Currently in my 3rd year with an overall 3.9

How am I doing it ? HARD WORK AND STUDY - all you need is grit and determination to do that work, keep up with the assignments, attend class and keep your grades up

\-- an enjoyment of history doesn't hurt either, I'd watched a ton of history tv drama shows and movies  as a teen.

So, no dude you do not need to be wicked smart to major in history or take history classes. What you need is determination and grit, and a bit of enjoyment."
college,ff3fqd0,t3_erc8gt,1579540126.0,"highschool attendance did not matter for me, i was a high school drop out with a 2.1 gpa and later I got a GED, and I still got into my local university.  of course, my university has like a 95% acceptance rate and 30% passing rate, so most of the people who come are are partiers and slackers.     I vowed that would not be me, and so far I've kept that promise with a 3.9 gpa in my 3rd year

When you get to college it's time to be SERIOUS and not skip and do the work, it's your money and career on the line in college"
college,feo5113,t3_dzfdbo,1579295205.0,"whew..ok so kudos for wanting to go down this track my fellow nerd :) we are a rare breed in the college world.

Becoming an academic professor is going to be hard, not to mention going for a Ph.D...and it's very true you may be stuck as an adjunct for a long time. It's competitive field with people fighting over positions in academia

I had thought about a similar path, but came to realize It might be easier to double major history and native history and then picking a masters in secondary ed and just teach in and around native reservations.

Anthropology is certainly an idea, but you may be required to get a Ph.D for some of the careers involved with that. Also, you may have to move from place to place where the field of work is, or specialize in a historical era or topic 

Kudos to you for whatever you decide to do! dont give up ! we have to prove everyone else wrong and follow your dreams :) we chose the hard stuff like this knowing it'd be a long road ahead lol"
college,feo3vca,t3_epwnib,1579294747.0,"yeah the niche /fastweb/scholarship sites are useless. I've looked around locally and there's nothing for us nontrad students

\*am also a deans list, i get little merit scholarships of like $100 and $200 every semester if I keep the grades up..but..yeah it's BS"
college,feo2njf,t3_eq2zsb,1579294253.0,"\*raises hand\* I feel you.

or like, you see something in the news or learn some historical fact and you wanna talk to them about it ..but you feel like if it's not about class material do you even have the right to bother them ?"
college,feko342,t3_eawwi3,1579204077.0,"It's not unemployable! I don't know how many times I've had to defend myself against people who think this. We a literal jack of all trades, we can make it work, we are determined, and we have a degree.  we can do teaching, library, archives, tourism, journalism etc. Yes, most of the paths in this major will require a masters, but we chose this hard stuff knowing it's a long road to go.

This is not  an easy major, it's hard and I've struggled to keep a high gpa, written lots of long essays that stress me out, and reading ! lots and lots of reading! and getting atleast 1 internship to prove I know what I'm doing. 

I've enjoyed it so much I'm now doing a double major with Native American history and have chosen to go into a teaching masters to share what I've learned with others and foster bridges of communication for the next generations."
college,fcb7yfb,t3_egwl0j,1577583537.0,"tossed all my gen eds notes, and i usually donate my texts to my on campus student support services program to give back for others. 

I 've kept my organized notes and textbook on lakota language, could be useful in helping to educate others and keep the language alive. 

Have also held onto 2 books on midwest tribes thats clear and eays to understand, i like to think these would serve in helping to educate others one day"

college,f7gn6bp,t3_dw30bj,1573709233.0,"depends on whats available at your college. I was minoring in indigenous history and then ended up taking so many classes for the minor I'm now turning it into a double major. Which I like to think will make me more appealing for teaching on a rez

You could do a minor in elementary education or middle school education.  Maybe global studies? or geography"
