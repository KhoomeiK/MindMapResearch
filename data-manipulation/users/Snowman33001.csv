socialanxiety,fffuy8l,t1_fffoek4,1579892353.0,Agreed.
TherapeuticKetamine,ffftgfu,t3_etd1lt,1579891428.0,"Wow, really happy for you. I had ECT as well, with memory gaps. It did seem to work pretty well on mood but brought back quite intense anxiety. 

This gives me hope to research ketamine, thanks for sharing."
AskReddit,fffnt5p,t1_ffdqwak,1579887946.0,Thank you - that was helpful to read right now!
RobinHood,ffdvo53,t3_eo748t,1579830071.0,"Mine is off to. But in my investing tab, the market value is correct."

Anxietyhelp,fefuugn,t3_eowxnq,1579065926.0,"Mine got much much better when I went keto/carnivore. Still have mind anxiety but physical symptoms are much less. Don’t know if that’s feasible for you though? (I’m not a doctor, just someone who used to suffer palpitations)"
carnivorediet,fefu9l3,t3_eowxu3,1579065394.0,"I’ve had this and also suffer from pretty severe anxiety so haven’t really figured it out yet BUT I do think last time I felt it, taking some salt and potassium with water helped pretty quickly.  May be worth a try? (Would not underestimate possibility of placebo here though, given my mind.) 

Also, are you eating enough? 

Sorry can’t be more helpful but will let you know if I find anything else that helps - not a fun feeling."
socialanxiety,fee5o91,t1_fedxok2,1579026916.0,It’s a career managing them.
Jung,fe3llkr,t3_enme4y,1578850406.0,I saw a vagina at first.
Anxietyhelp,fdxtl8h,t3_enc2o8,1578772796.0,"I’m trying a carnivore diet and it seems to be helping quite a bit. 

Also cold showers, sprinting up stairs (just 20 seconds twice a day) and long walks. Also therapy once a week and meditating, although not as disciplined at that as I’d like to be.

Still unbearable anxiety too much of the time, but there are bright spots. 

It’s a nightmare. Don’t wish this on anybody."
YangForPresidentHQ,fdqv8y4,t3_emlcq0,1578675354.0,Inspired me to donate again.

Kind of infuriating. But that’s just me."

CPTSD,fcu3qv3,t3_eivjt3,1577971729.0,That would make me infuriated. I think you may be  breaking a cycle though!

zerocarb,fcswkux,t1_fcswi81,1577926940.0,"Yes, but pretty mild compared to what I used to experience, also increased anxiety and more hunger that felt unnecessary."
zerocarb,fcswglj,t3_eiqhwo,1577926855.0,I feel like I do the next day but I can’t be sure. I stopped experimenting with it after the third time. Used to drink them a lot.
SuicideWatch,fcsvwpg,t3_einsh4,1577926457.0,"I know this sounds ridiculous but are you up for trying nofap/carnivore (or keto) diet? These two things have been helping me I believe. Worth a shot? (Assuming you’re not already doing these.) 

I know that feeling and the thoughts that come along with it and it is hell. You have my compassion and sympathy."
Anxietyhelp,fcsv7gw,t1_fcsuls6,1577925947.0,"I totally relate. It’s what I’m trying to practice haha, good luck and have fun!"
Anxietyhelp,fcsuhhc,t3_eiqc9w,1577925422.0,I know this probably won’t help you right now but what I’m working on is remembering that it’s okay to be awkward and for things to be awkward.

roastmytrack,fcll05u,t3_ehtark,1577750243.0,"I thought it was really good. Don’t have any criticism and all I can say is I’d love to make music that clear and loud. Ok, actually, I didn’t think it was the most creative thing ever but maybe that’s not what you’re going for, just my personal taste anyway. For what it is, I think it’s executed very well and was satisfying to hear."
