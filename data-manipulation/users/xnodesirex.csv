That's one of the few and only places it is discussed as such, with the vast majority of installers in every other thread saying they wouldn't trust it/don't believe it.

Marginal. 

It's not advertised as such because the decoupling properties are minimal, and that's in the best of circumstances.

Don't use cement board or Hardie. Don't tile directly on plywood. 

Use a decoupling membrane, like ditra or ditra xl between the plywood and your tile. It will add to the coat marginally, and pay significant dividends in the long run. 

If you're pulling the subfloor, adding blocking is a great idea. Use 3/4 subflooring, ditraxl and go nuts.
