AskReddit,fem8c4w,t3_epwohz,1579243435.0,"okay so when I was 8 I had this recurring dream for 5 nights in a row. each one was the same setting, but I saw different things in them. my grandpa was dying in the hospital, for context. 

it would always start out the same way. I'd walk out of my house to find a red road and it was dark outside and really foggy. I'd follow the road and along the way I would see different creepy things inside of the house windows I passed. at the end of the road I would always see my grandpa back at my house in the window, smiling a waving at me. the last night I had the dream, at the end of the road, my grandpa was no longer smiling a waving. he was in a hospital bed, and he was dead. that morning I found out he died the night before, and I never had that dream again. Weirdest thing that's ever happened to me."
