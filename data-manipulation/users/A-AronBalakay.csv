It wasn't a ""1, 2, 3 ... count."" It felt more like, ""1 ... 2, 3 ... 4"""
triathlon,fewljuw,t1_fewkm6b,1579413691.0,Swimming definitely is the most unnatural feeling for me. I just got comfortable pushing off and have only started exhaling underwater.
Tennesseetitans,fevmyat,t1_fevl6bx,1579399193.0,Is his arm strength now completely shot?
triathlon,feebusj,t1_fee4ouo,1579030549.0,"First off, great stuff.

Second, does ""FTP"" mean Fuck the Packers?"

minnesotavikings,fdcrq1e,t3_eknr8d,1578282425.0,Have the Vikings ever beaten a team in the year of our lord 2020 when they were 7 (or more) point underdogs? I cannot recall.
minnesotavikings,fdbxg3v,t3_ekja3y,1578263460.0,Watched the game with a crew of Vikings and Falcons fans. Can’t even count the amount of hugs and screams!
AmItheAsshole,fd5wvxb,t1_fd5rvvy,1578182515.0,FWB. Sorry. I’m bad.
AmItheAsshole,fd5fg4l,t1_fd5dteh,1578177107.0,"Thanks. There’s a whole backstory and pent up frustration on my part and I think I just briefly lost my cool when talking with her. 

Glad to know I am NTA."
AmItheAsshole,fd5exu9,t1_fd5ecqu,1578176948.0,Oh. Sorry. Meant “FWB.” I’m just a poor writer haha.

AmItheAsshole,fd5dd21,t1_fd5cygu,1578176509.0,"I felt bad when she started crying. Well, my GF chewed me out for making the FBW cry. And I started second guessing myself and thought I may have been an asshole."
fatlogic,fckpq0x,t1_fckpd1m,1577730522.0,"It's truly stunning how delusional people can be. To literally ignore decades of peer-reviewed research showing the direct link between obesity and severe medical ailments.

I kid you not, I once saw someone say that the medical field, as a whole, is fatphobic and anti-fat."
fatlogic,fckl66n,t3_eeme20,1577727727.0,I am triggered by the discipline and resilience shown in this thread. I am so triggered that my body has now entered starvation mode and developed hypothyroidism. I literally just gained 50 pounds--just like that.
fatlogic,fckkw4k,t3_ehoffh,1577727553.0,"How is losing weight NOT taking care of oneself? You are literally reducing your chances of developing severe medical ailments. For instance, I'm certain reducing your chances of developing Type 2 diabetes is taking care of yourself."
minnesotavikings,fckfre1,t1_fcke3cj,1577724335.0,"We will really need to keep him. That's why I think we are going to cut Rhodes, Griffen, and Joseph. Unless, there is some sort restructuring we can do as to Griffen and Joseph. But, Rhodes can go. Unless he, by some miracle, regains his 2017 form during this playoff push."

fatlogic,fc6zdjo,t3_egc9c3,1577493432.0,"Ate too many cookies and doughnuts these past 2 weeks. Today, after eating a *delicious* snickerdoodle, I felt sick, briskly walked to the bathroom, and puked. Thank god for the available Listerine.  

In my past life, I used to eat like this all the time and never felt sick or ill. I'd even eat/drink other junk food throughout the day, like chips, coffee coolers, and of course Skittles."

triathlon,fbwevqz,t3_edxi54,1577148089.0,"The Internet is all over the place as to weight-training. Some places say high reps, low weight; others low reps, high weight. They each say the other is wrong. 

I currently train 5x5 (by default) and would prefer the low reps, high weight approach. Do you guys have any suggestions?"
