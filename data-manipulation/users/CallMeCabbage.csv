dndnext,ffghnxk,t3_ereemq,1579906457.0,"I have a few regarding Misty Step, Eladrin, and Find Steed.  
1. Can Misty Step and Eladrins Fey Step teleport you in the air 30 feet above solid ground?  
2. If I cast Misty Step on myself + Find Steed, can I teleport the steed and myself two different places?  
3. If I can do question 1 and I'm on my mount, falling 30 feet do I also take damage or just my mount?"
