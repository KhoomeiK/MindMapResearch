TTC30,feaaw09,t3_enyza7,1578946423.0,"Tomorrow I have my saline ultrasound to check uterine lining for abnormalities and scarring. I’m really worried because a) we’ve been trying for awhile now with no luck, and b) I had some surgeries in my 20s in which the doc thought I might have a bicornuated uterus. My HSG came back normal except that maybe some uterine cysts, hard to tell."

It took 3 months to schedule with the VA doctor, who then told him his ears were too dirty to perform the audiology tests, and the audiologist didn’t do ear cleanings. SO, he had to make an appointment with his regular doctor again to have ears cleaned, then wait another 2 months to see VA doc again, waited 4 months to hear the VA would cover the aids, then had to made apt with hearing aid specialist, then get them ordered, which took 10 weeks, then fitted......."

Just as my dad was about to give up, finally approval came thru and he got pretty awesome hearing aids, better than he could have ever afforded thru Medicare."
LifeProTips,fdhp7if,t3_elffky,1578427402.0,"Another thing to add for parents - be open with your children about times when things went wrong for you. Sometimes, parents want to come across as perfect, or at least try to hide/diminish mistakes they’ve made. This may give kids unrealistic expectations for how life actually is, and when things for wrong for them, to make it seem even worse. Own the mistakes/problems of your past, and share them with your kids."
