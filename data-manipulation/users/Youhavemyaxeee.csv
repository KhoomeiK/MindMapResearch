In **Philosopher's Stone** we're supposed to be impressed that Harry got into Hogwarts. We're supposed to assume that other, lesser, schools of magic exist in the UK. Same for buying a wands at Olivander's, etc. Every aspect of Britain's wizarding world is presented as though more than one option is available, and Harry is getting all the good stuff because he's special (rich.) It turns out that none of those were choices. British wizards *have* to use those facilities because no others exist.

An minor can be tried and convicted of underage magic with location being the only evidence. This opens the door to siblings getting each other arrested, and I'm surprised the Weasleys never did it.

Sometimes the manipulation goes two ways: the feeder wants to keep the eater obese so that the eater continues to be dependent. In your case, your wife is doing the manipulating.

In **Philosopher's Stone** we're supposed to be impressed that Harry got into Hogwarts. We're supposed to assume that other, lesser, schools of magic exist in the UK. Same for buying a wands at Olivander's, etc. Every aspect of Britain's wizarding world is presented as though more than one option is available, and Harry is getting all the good stuff because he's special (rich.) It turns out that none of those were choices. British wizards *have* to use those facilities because no others exist.

An minor can be tried and convicted of underage magic with location being the only evidence. This opens the door to siblings getting each other arrested, and I'm surprised the Weasleys never did it.

AskReddit,fdm197s,t1_fdkhn6z,1578537411.0,"I've got a swing chair *in* my home. If you Google nest swing chair, that's what I have. I have a lamp, a blanket, and keep the books I'm reading on a shelf right next to it.  Swinging is the best and you should get one of these too."
AskReddit,fdlv47x,t1_fdkdqu9,1578533210.0,So this how all those gifs of people playing with fire end. Did you see the girl trying to light a candle with tissue yesterday? It's amazing her outcome wasn't the same as yours.
mildlyinfuriating,fdluodh,t1_fdk7zt4,1578532913.0,"Moving the customers fast earns more tips. I bet all these people in the comments who had their plates taken early, sometimes with part of the uneaten meal on them, still tipped."
AskReddit,fdlub90,t1_fdlcxnj,1578532666.0,"Yeah, if I'm awake at night and there's housework to do then I might as well get it done. What's the point of wasting time simply because it's not a conventional time to be doing that task."
AmItheButtface,fdllnuq,t1_fdkh8si,1578526827.0,"My SO was blown away when I introduced him to evening showers this summer. We live in a hot, humid country. In winter, one shower a day is more than enough. In summer, a quick rinse before bed isn't quite essential, but helps to keep the bedding fresh. I find being clean helps to relax me into sleep, too."
books,fdjh8g8,t3_ekbpi5,1578470702.0,*Helliconia* by Brian Aldiss might suit you. Also *The Left Hand of Darkness* Ursula K Leguin may also suit.
books,fdjelnq,t3_ekotfj,1578467558.0,Yes! I really enjoy her style. The atmosphere of the excitement of the books in the shop compared to a drab life. The gradual decline of a family mirrored by their crumbling house. This is a favourite book for sure.
AskReddit,fdim3hu,t1_fdibqya,1578445949.0,You got banned from a sub you'd never submitted to or commented on!? That's insane.
AskReddit,fdilvto,t1_fdiaitn,1578445812.0,I got the same ban for calling someone an idiot. Don't marry the guy who cheated with you. He's not a catch. Cheaters are gonna cheat.
Showerthoughts,fdi5h25,t1_fdhue70,1578436077.0,"Yup. The cinema is so expensive, too. I like the comfort of my home when I'm watching a film."
AmItheButtface,fdgbnkc,t3_ekwhi7,1578388845.0,"YTB because all of this is about controlling her body. You wanted to cuddle, she didn't. You sulked because you didn't get your way. Your girlfriend wanted to wear a certain item of clothing. You told her she couldn't. You got upset about it because you apparently already told her she couldn't wear it.

Your girlfriend is an independent individual with agency. Quit controlling her."
zelda,fdg25yo,t1_fdfz25e,1578377249.0,"You become accustomed to game mechanics the more you play, and develop better instincts regarding where to go, what to do, whether or not an area needs you to have specific items/skills. If you've only been playing for a short time then it's not really fair to yourself to say that you're not good.

Play games at difficulty levels you feel comfortable with, and don't feel pushed to dive into Dark Souls style games."
zelda,fdg1w42,t1_fdf341y,1578376974.0,I'm with you. I don't like BoTW very much. I want other Zelda games to come to the Switch in the same way that Link's Awakening did.
memes,fdg1k3k,t1_fdfyp8c,1578376642.0,I got Josh from Daybreak. I think he's eighteen but I'm in my thirties so it still feels uncomfortable.
AskReddit,fdg0lnn,t1_fdfx1jx,1578375705.0,"Lol, saying I'm incorrect adds nothing. This whole thread is people discussing popular things that they don't like. You're butthurt because I don't enjoy something you blindly love. Go to the Hollow Knight sub for your fanboy echo chamber.

*No, you're wrong,* is all you've said and all that you have to say. I'm laughing at you because a compete stranger's dislike of something you love so clearly hurts you for no reason. Nothing you've said is going to change my subjective experience of a three hour game padded by repetition into fifty hours plus.

Hollow Knight is empty prettiness. We're done here."
