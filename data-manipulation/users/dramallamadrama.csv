Like others have said I would reevaluate selling. I get you feel like you want to buy something bigger but it isn't going to work out. You are going to loose the rent income on top of having a higher house payment.  Try  putting the rent income into a bank account for 6 months. Put the extra money you will need on the bigger house in the same account for 6 months. If at any point you take money out of the account ""for an emergency"" or don't put the full amount in, then you have failed and should adjust your lifestyle more. Start the 6 months over again."
