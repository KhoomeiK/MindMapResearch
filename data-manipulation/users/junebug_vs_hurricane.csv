ADHD,ff9v0c9,t3_escc7t,1579722054.0,It makes sense that you keep looking for a way to focus because you really need a solution. The problem is more that you're having trouble finding one.
hoarding,ff9ucre,t1_ff9s282,1579721533.0,"Tdlr: 

1. Pick a mess that's annoying, easy to to get to, and is in the way of other cleaning. Kitchen sink or full garbage cans or something like that. 

2. Get supplies. Lots of them and the best quality you can afford to make it as easy as possible.

3. Slowly and steady work on it. Occasionally imagine how much easier life will be with this done.

4. Celebrate! 

5. Continue good habit. 


Long version: I start with really simple goals chosen based on how accessible they are and how much they will make later steps easier. 

I noticed that one of the things blocking me from washing dishes was the sink being full of filthy gross dishes. 

I made it my goal to clean the sink and I promised myself I wouldn't beat myself up if it took me forever. Then I decided what tools I need: dish soap, new sponges and dish rags, a bottle brush for coffee mugs, vinegar for really stubborn residue. I bought the supplies and put them in place to be ready. Then everytime I thought about dishes I went and  washed one or two but didn't force myself to push through everything at once. In kitchen to get water? Might as well wash one dish. Letting dog out? The dish drainer can get emptied (don't forget about the dog).

It took me a couple of days to complete, but eventually that got done and I had one less obstacle to being clean, plus I was in the habit of doing a dish occasionally so it wasn't so hard to continue. 

I noticed that my room is too cluttered to organize so next I started picking out things I hate and putting them in discard bags. That'll give me space to organize the things I keep and make it easier to do other stuff in my life."

In the 90s many of my friend's parents lost their savings to a market crash. In the 2000s there was a short crash that drained 40% of my retirement fund.

Advice: Try sharing your knowledge and opinions on subreddits dedicated to your hobbies or area of interest. If you've been lurking for awhile you probably are familiar with common questions and answers and the general attitude of the sub to predict how your comments will be treated. On a gaming sub people frequently ask about glitches and mods that I know about, and it feels good to be the one to help. Or when someone asks about social anxiety you can encourage them because you've experienced it too. 

My experience: I have a lot of anxiety- after social interaction I frequently feel ashamed and exposed like I did something embarrassing. Sometimes I go through my comment history on reddit to see if I've been embarrassing myself and it's reassuring because for the most part my comments are honest and attempt to be helpful. When I do get downvoted it's usually not because I said anything bad or crazy, rather I just didn't make the point I was intending to make. Occasionally I do say something rude or ignorant but I apologize when that happens. It's making me more confident."
