Mattress,feoptvo,t1_feofhnz,1579303692.0,But how’s the quality with that bed? I’ve heard that the air pockets eventually leak and that SleepNumber isn’t too helpful with repairs. The beds are also pricey right? I paid only $900 for my king bed that will last at least 15 years.

sleeptrain,fdk966c,t3_elrqcd,1578498910.0,"The key with difficult babies is a consistent schedule and adequate sleep. I think changing her schedule around may help. Also, a pitch dark room with white noise makes a huge difference!

Here’s the schedule I used with my little one at that age (Moms on Call):

Typical Day 6-8 Months

(Sippy cup keeps showing up)

7am - Bottle or nurse (6-8 oz.)

8am - Baby food and a sippy cup*

9am - Start nap (ideally 1 ½ hour)

11am - Bottle or nurse (6-8 oz.)

Noon - Baby food and a sippy cup*

12:30/1:30 Nap (ideally 1 ½ - 2 hours) - pick one time between 12:30 and 1:30 and start nap at that time each day

3pm - Bottle or nurse (6-8 oz.)

4/5pm - Anytime between 4 and 5pm baby food and a sippy cup* available

5pm - Catnap - no longer than 30 minutes if they still take one

6:30 - Bath

7p - Last nighttime feeding (6-8 oz.) or (8-10 oz.) bottle or nurse & bedtime story

7:30pm - In crib for the night (See “Sleep” Section for additional instructions)


*Sippy cups have 2-4 ounces of formula/breastmilk

After a week, my little one was sleeping solidly through the night."
sleeptrain,fdgtss7,t3_elbuzc,1578408141.0,"Oh man, I’m so sorry your little one is waking up! Especially when she’s already been sleep trained no less. I recommend that you allow her to cry until your usual wake up time and go and get her then. “Sleep training” is more of a state of being rather than a week long period of change. Though some situations may require that you go in her room and soothe her, if you know she is okay (no fever, comfortable temp and fed) then stay out. This can be rough, but I think you’ll all be happier when your babe learns to sleep through mild discomfort."
sleeptrain,fddxofa,t3_ekmapr,1578326491.0,"It sounds like you’re doing great. I would just recommend eliminating checks all together. My LO would get worse if we came and checked on him, so we stopped right away. Now, he only cries if he needs something, and that only happens like   twice a month."
sleeptrain,fddphvk,t1_fdcw6zb,1578320445.0,"Hey! I’m glad you’re feeling better about your journey! This is one of the hardest things you’ll do for your little baby! Though, it’s easier than being sleep deprived for years, I promise. 

To answer your first Question, yes, it’s best to do the sleep training in the environment that you will have them sleep most of the time. If that is in the crib, alone, then that is how you should sleep train. It’s really hard to sleep train while sharing a room. 

For the second question, you can drop the night feeds first if you want but it’s not necessary. To drop night feeds, start the process during the day. If baby’s wake times will be 7a-7p, that first day, they need to get all of their feeds during that time. When they wake up at night, you can do what you need to do to get them to sleep, except feed them. Once it only takes a min or so to get the babe back to sleep, you can start sleep training. It took us about 4 days to get the night feeds dropped."

sleeptrain,fcvnt9b,t1_fco5c1u,1578006107.0,Yep. It can be tough. Limited space makes it super difficult to sleep train.
sleeptrain,fcqc2a6,t1_fcopm3g,1577883042.0,Feel free to DM me. :-)
sleeptrain,fcohtln,t1_fcohhl9,1577832571.0,"Yes, we did. My husband felt it was more humane, haha. I do think it made him cry less in the end bc food was no longer one of his sleep associations."
sleeptrain,fco3gph,t1_fco2z6l,1577823361.0,"Good question, I think there are many options, with doing nothing on one end of the spectrum and strict cry it out on the other. Cry it out is the fastest, but we chose the middle ground first. My husband would get up with the baby, and rock, bounce and sing to him until he fell back asleep. It only took about 15 minutes to get him back to sleep for another couple of hours. Once he would go back to sleep after about 5 minutes reliably, we switched to strict cry it out, which only took three days. Babe has been sleeping 12 hours every night since."
sleeptrain,fcnxvsv,t3_ei4e5o,1577820576.0,Your schedule sounds LEGIT. I think she has sleep crutches and when she wakes up (which happens naturally to babies in between their sleep cycles) she is expecting some help to get back to sleep. I think shes a great candidate for dropping the night feedings.
sleeptrain,fcnwabs,t1_fcnovg6,1577819718.0,Is there anywhere your baby can sleep other than in your room?
sleeptrain,fcnvv4v,t1_fcnp0xn,1577819467.0,"Sure! I know sleep training is tough, I've been in your shoes. I literally cried while my baby cried in the next room.

In regards to number 4, it is complicated. Many studies showing that cry it out is harmful for babies are studies on neglected children who are hardly soothed throughout the day. There was an old idea that came from the around the 1880's that babies shouldn't be held too much. Like, during the *day*. Obviously that idea is bonkers and no one should follow that because parents are responsible for soothing their children obviously, and that soothing largely occurs through physical contact and eye contact. Sleep training is a short term process where baby learns to put themselves to sleep and that is it. When you wake them up in the morning with a smile on your face and cuddles and kisses, they will start to understand that night time is a time for them to go to sleep and put them selves back to sleep when they wake up.

You can certainly continue what you are doing, and your child will eventually learn to sleep through the night, it just won't happen as quickly as it would with sleep training, and as a two year old, she's going to cry, which is definitely the HARDEST part for a parent.

sleeptrain,fcnj3mc,t3_ei55zl,1577812681.0,"1. Cry it out works for most babies.

2. Most doctors recommend it. 

3. There are no long term psychological effects for the baby. 

4.  There is a misconception that babies are crying because they feel abandoned by their parents at night. The babies cry because they need to sleep. Remember, babies cry anytime they need something, and that includes needing to fall asleep. They are only crying because they want you to provide them with their sleep crutch, whether that may be nursing, rocking, cosleeping, etc.

4. Babies are like dogs, in that they can be trained to fall asleep on their own, but only by forming new associations. Remember how Pavlov‘s dogs started salivating when they heard the bell ring, even before the food was served? As your baby begins to fall asleep on their own, they start to learn, that they can do it much faster by helping themselves go to sleep, and not crying, fussing or calling your name.

5. Your sleep is extremely important. You need to be of sound mind in order to give your baby the best during the day.

6. In order for sleep training to work, you have to follow through with it for at least five days. Some children, especially older ones take longer than that. Remember, you need to give your child as many opportunities as possible of falling asleep without their sleep associations, so that they learn that they can put themselves to sleep.

7. Sleep trained babies are literally happier during the day when they can get a good nights sleep. You will be happier too.

sleeptrain,fc955pl,t3_ego8ae,1577547206.0,"First of all, you and your hubs are doing a great job and you have a beautiful 5 month old to show for it! 

Is the baby still gaining weight? If so, I agree with your sleep trainer. It sounds like the baby has a sleep association with the midnight feed. He will learn that he can put himself back to sleep at midnight instead of needing a feed. The earlier you train him, the better. Trust me. I’ve seen it work with dozens of babies and the ones who are trained early on sleep better as they grow. 

I follow pretty much the same schedule that your sleep trainer recommends. The goal is to squeeze all the feedings into the day time so they sleep comfortably without needing to eat at night. Let me know if you have other questions."
beyondthebump,fbu7u96,t1_fbu5tys,1577109436.0,"Yep, I get it. You can always show them a YouTube video of a live c section. They have those training videos for medical students that show all the graphic detail. That way they understand what you’re going through."
