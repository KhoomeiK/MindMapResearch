depression,fdw1dcq,t1_fdvmb5m,1578754070.0,"Exactly! I've told my GP that me getting out of bed is one thing. I can kinda make myself do that but, asking me to try and take care of my personal needs, lets not even mention getting up to go into the kitchen to make myself a bowl of cereal, or even go outside, is expecting waaaaayyyyy tooo much! I do realize that others are in worse situations that I am, and I definitely have empathy for them and everyone experiencing those situations, but I don't have the energy or motivation to do or feel anything - I don't even feel my own pain. I'm walking around like a zombie, just kinda disconnected from any and everything."
depression,fdvgbfx,t3_emnl5m,1578747136.0,"I was just thinking this. Yesterday, I told someone that I was dealing with severe major depression and had been for years. I was told to just ""change your thinking"" and ""stop being so hard on yourself - that's where you're messing up."" I had to end the conversation there. I already feel like I'm not worth existing and that I already do everything wrong, and this person just added another thing that I'm doing wrong. Thank you!!!!! I was also told to not tell anyone else. Honestly, it doesn't need to be cancer, just something physical and visible that people would be more willing understand. Almost two years ago, it was discovered I had a brain tumor - it was successfully removed. People at work were more supportive and understanding. Now, I'm dealing with a very serious depressive episode and I'm being told to ""think positive"", ""be happy"", ""go volunteer, that will make you see how much better you have it"", ""just snap out of it"" on and on and on.... Now, if I had died due to the tumor, that would be more ""accepted"" than if I die from depression and suicide. I would be called a ""coward, selfish, weak."" People would say ""oh, I never knew. She never told anyone she was feeling like this."" When in all actuality, I had, people just didn't want to hear it. I want others to just live in my head for a week so they can understand what we go through on a daily basis. People just don't have any empathy for anything they can't see and understand."
depression,fcvfbcl,t1_facui97,1578000897.0,"I'm sorry for taking so long to reply. Things have been really hard. I spend all of my days feeling nothing. I try to cry, nothing happens. A social worker told me to talk to someone, there is no one. I was so angry when I woke up January 1st because I swore to myself that I wouldn't make it to 2020."
depression,fcvek6a,t1_fcss2g4,1578000452.0,"Yes! That and saying ""God gives His hardest battles to His strongest soldiers"". I didn't ask to be a soldier, plus, I've been fighting battles since I was little. How many more battles do I have to fight? What is the test here? How long is this test supposed to go on? How long is the ""strongest soldier"" supposed to stay strong? I'm literally physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted. I don't have the energy and just don't want to do this anymore."
depression,fbswa2f,t3_ee58qm,1577061915.0,"My mother did the exact same thing. She'd talk about me on the phone to others saying that I was ""emotional"" or ""I'm just doing everything for attention"". The last statement is what she said after I was almost successful with a suicide attempt. Although it has taken me quite a while to do this, in the last 3 years, I have cut all ties with her and the rest of my family. For the most part, it has helped me although it does get difficult for me around the holidays. 

I know it's easier said than done but, just try to hold on. Stay strong and just prepare for when you can move out on your own. Come here and vent to us, we're here for you. <3"
