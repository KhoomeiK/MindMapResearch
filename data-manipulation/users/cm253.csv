todayilearned,fff0i3m,t1_ffd1y7g,1579872270.0,"This might explain why triglycerides fell in the control group, and why a patient's levels fell while taking a placebo. But it doesn't address the question of why placebo effects are increasing, or why that is the case only in US studies. Any thought on why that might be true?"
agedlikemilk,ffdgliz,t3_esx6hj,1579820432.0,"I looked up the article. The actual statement was more like ""Warren and I will be the last two competing for the nomination"". It's more of a misleading title, but Newsweek is kinda crap."

Libertarian,fei89v5,t1_feh1svp,1579132496.0,"Even funding the pension fund with assets (equities, bonds, cash, whatever) wouldn't have saved GM. It was a problem of erroneous projections. Someone else pointed out that people are living much longer than they used to, but that's only a part of where their (and GM was by no means alone in this) projections were off. A bigger contributor to the shortfall is the soaring cost of healthcare. Part of the retirement package is a healthcare plan for retirees and healthcare costs have been rising much faster than standard inflation for decades.  Being unable to cover the premiums is what is bankrupting pension funds.

But hey, at least they didn't promise retirees that they would cover college tuition, or they'd be in a real jam."

Libertarian,fcuzil0,t1_fcuqnqq,1577991617.0,"I certainly don't want to put myself in the position of defending Mike Shea. If the title had been about him endorsing those views I'd have no issue.  But I do believe that the facts matter, and the title is just factually incorrect. Too often subs become echo chambers in which the intent or effect of a post becomes more important than the truth of it. I've even seen people defend this stance. I don't want to see this sub go that route."
Libertarian,fcu397p,t3_eixt5d,1577971250.0,"Shea is awful, but the title of this post is misleading. It indicates Mike Shea said it when it was a quote from someone else that he agreed with.

His birth certificate might say female, but you'd probably lose your mind if he beat your daughter in cross country because he was made to compete against girls."
