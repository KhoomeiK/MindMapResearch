The only reason I still subscribe to this subreddit is for the season 8 storyline hate posts that brings a cathartic sense of gratitude to my soul. 

That being said, props to the good drawing skills OP!"

tech,ff592th,t1_ff3sz0a,1579583904.0,"Just curious, does your boss even still need to work at 73? It’s also a bit sad that people need to work so late in life. I remember thinking ~65ish to 70 was retirement age. At 73 I can only imagine how much your physical ailments and lack of modern skills limit your ability to operate day to day from basic things like touch typing to reading smaller texts and learning new procedures/technologies vs “this is the way it’s always been done”."

breakingbad,fe0b9po,t1_fdzcal3,1578808508.0,"Agreed, you re-watch earlier seasons because you assume there are story elements that have an impactful payoff later. The Valyrian swords, Jon's heritage, Arya's training, Lord of Light, Night King, and tons of other clues/characters hinted towards for some future payoff.
