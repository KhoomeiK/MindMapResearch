I felt so motivated to go 100 days or more without a binge like some people on the BED subreddit have been able to do, so inspiring! And then I lasted a day.

I’ve been so down lately. I think I’ll focus on recovery only. Every time I yell at myself not to eat this food or that food, it’s backfiring again. I’m burned out again. I might need to just not even have a plan of what or what not to eat and have my only rules be “no binging” and “don’t spend excessively on food” (don’t eat out too much).

I know too much about the world to let myself off the hook like this, now that food *is* a moral issue—but the more I know, the more I want to rebel, and it just shows that I’m not ready to handle this kind of worldview yet. The more I yell at myself not to eat a food, even if it’s for deeper reasons than in the past, the more I want it.

I’ve found that if I can make it over two days without binging, I can make it over a week, and I want to be able to surpass my 30-day record by A LOT.

A strategy that really helps is being gentle...even if I go over my goal by a lot but don’t binge, that’s success. Even if I binge but don’t eat meat (trying to eat more plant-based food), that’s a success. Even if I eat meat but eat healthfully, that’s a success.
