Then I took out a heavy book and threw it on the ground. Want that? I can think of 3 ways to concuss someone with that.

Kept my belt. Fuck, if I wanted to hurt someone, I'd use my goddamn bare hands. 

I was the meekest kid in school. 130 lbs soaking wet (I'm tall) theater kid, but I fight for justice and I liked my belt."

Now I have a bruise on my neck, and a jammed finger. But I saved the shot. 

I have witnesses. I'm just clumsy. I thought I might have bruised my hyoid too. And my nose bleed a few days later."

 Transitioning at 40 and 14. They are all awesome and beautiful. Even without surgical changes or hormones.

If you want boobs, get a fancy bra, rue Paul has great recommendations for that stuff. And doors are way easy to add locks. $15 at home Depot and 5 min on YouTube. Boom. Lock!

I'm lucky to have so many near unique friends who accept me as a nerdy straight cis(?) girl. And I hope they understand how much I love them for who they are."

Don't use savings, invest in various levels of accounts and leave alone til you are 20. Charles Schwab is okay. I just used my bank representative. I was about 12. Loaned my parents money before I was 16."

They still think a 23 year old and a 13 year old was fine and he was wrongfully convicted. He tried to get with me when I was 15 and he was 20. But I carry a knife and don't take shit. Plus he was a douche canoe.

Lol. My label gun is cheap and I have loads of tape."

No humid, no skeeters, and beach in December is a nice picnic.

And no one cares about quakes unless you get a decent one every 20 or 30 years. And only idiots build houses in flood and fire risk area. That's why insurance doesn't like to cover them."
