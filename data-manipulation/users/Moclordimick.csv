mtgfinance,ffme628,t1_ffm5ug0,1580053207.0,I agree that it’s very edh playable. I like in a lot of situations more than enlightened. Going to hand is great instead of on top. Sure you can do enlightened on upkeep but I prefer getting what I need when I’m ready and not having to draw it. Idyllic is the best enchantment to hand tutor in white in edh to me

nfl,ff6irwm,t1_ff6h5xj,1579628088.0,"I agree with the Stafford part but injuries might take his chances away. I honestly would draft Tua and let him sit behind Stafford a year (injuries permitting). Gives Tua longer to get a grip of the system and be fully ready. 

Tua is compared to Russel Wilson a lot  (skill wise) and Bevell would probably love a chance to work with talent like that again.

I know they need defense, so if they feel theres a later round QB that will be worth a shit, then take defense. Especially if Young somehow is there"
