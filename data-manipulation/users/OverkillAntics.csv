The closest we came to trying was when Ford passed the Metric Conversion Act that made metric the preferred measurement system for trade, but made the mistake of making switching completely voluntary as opposed to actual meaningful change, which was fucking stupid. So no, that's not a big enough reason.

whowouldwin,ffh2ge6,t3_etbggk,1579921310.0,"Yeah, 616 Cap's martial arts prowess alone makes him a one-man army. Add in his massively superior stats (particularly his peak-human reaction time and his stamina) and his tactical genius mind, and this should be a cinch for him even if he were butt fucking nude. Round 1 shouldn't be too much trouble, given how his shield can cut down swathes of Spartans while he can one-shot a good number of others via either strikes or pressure points. Round 2 would go slower than Round 1, but not significantly slower. Expect to see a lot more gore. Round 3, however, is a different story. Now, from what I've seen, MCU Cap is physically superior to his 616 counterpart, except when it comes to his reflexes and combat speed. He isn't a casual bullet timer, something even characters like 616 Hawkeye are, and he isn't nearly as skilled. He can probably take out a good amount, but will ultimately go down.

Bonus Round: 616 Spider-Man. Way of the Spider + the fact that he is several times stronger and faster than all of them + Spider-Sense = basically a guaranteed victory."

""Fuck"", ""shit"", and ""cunt"" used to only mean the act of intercourse, feces, and the female genitalia (all the way back in the days of Old English), respectively, with no vulgarity attached. Conversely, ""bastard"" used to hold extremely heavy connotation, but now can be used as a mild insult at worst. And, more relevantly, ""gay"" originated as a loanword from Old French that only meant joyous or frivolous. If it can change from that to a term against homosexuals, it should be able to change to another term that means something not derogatory."
