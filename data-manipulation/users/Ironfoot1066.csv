And the confusion comes from the fact that the only time the judge is needed is if she wants an abortion and her parents won't consent. That makes more sense."
facepalm,fgkbrzn,t3_eyxu7c,1580861897.0,"This makes even less sense from the pro life viewpoint:

""We simultaneously maintain that 1) the fetus inside you is a human being entitled to human rights, and 2) if you're mature enough you're allowed to kill said human."""
eu4,fg64xyr,t1_fg640t0,1580553845.0,"Rotate fronts for your wars if you can. AE is regional. I'm playing a France game atm, and for a while I had three different fronts I rotated between. Finish a war in Britain, move on to Iberia, then to Italy. By the time I'm back to Britain those truces have expired and the outrage has thawed. Rinse and repeat. Nobody cares about you conquering territory far away from them. Works even better for bigger countries like the ottomans where enemies are even further apart."

facepalm,fed70xh,t1_fed66yg,1579001901.0,The discussion isn't about what's average. It's about the blind assumption that every situation falls into the same 'average' category. You're completely right that the guy is probably to blame in the average context. But making that assumption everywhere is unfair stereotyping and this is an example of an alternate situation.
PrequelMemes,fe1zy42,t3_engpou,1578832917.0,"Definitely possible. I did it. Graduated in 2015. Worked hard in high school to get good grades and SAT score and went to a big state school in my hometown. Academic scholarships + in-state tuition + part time fast food job + living with parents = 4 year degree and no debt.

It limits your options, but that's life. Complaining that you can't go to the overpriced private liberal arts schools affordably is like complaining that you can't take a vacation to the Maldives affordably."
Kentucky,fe1vjdp,t1_fdykrui,1578831362.0,Precisely. These are all local governance issues. The state legislature and governors are more to blame than federal representatives and senators.
