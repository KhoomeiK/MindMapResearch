The Muslim travel ban is pure nonsense, as well as the absolutely pressing need for him to give the rich bigger tax breaks he quickly implemented. Simultaneously I also really like and admire Representative Ocasio Cortez, because she’s asking a lot of questions of “why” certain things are the way they are and why certain laws of the land are the way they are, and I think we need that, including some kind of rehaul of the immigration system. I think more flexibility in having the chance to come here and more options, but stricter oversight and less forgiveness on things like any criminal activity whatsoever having bigger consequences. More open but less forgiving to those who misuse it.

I’m an independent voter so I hope not to start a debate just provide context to my comment!"
offmychest,ffekfoa,t3_et5uoo,1579851747.0,"The right wing media narrative is how easy and Swiss cheese our immigration laws are, but actually go and study the means to immigrate to the USA and the options are very limited.  A k1 visa is extremely difficult and subjective to the interpretation of a random immigration officer.  Work visas are done in a limited lottery. Pursuing an international relationship could take you years. I feel like we don’t have good freedom of movement when it comes to the ability of people you love to come here."

Oh going to see your favorite music group? Be sure to buy the meet and greet package for a thousand dollars where you will be whisked through at a rapid pace without so much as a response to asking Steve Perry “how are you?”"

It just takes me to an absolutely magical place that’s a bit old Timey, distant and foreign/European."
USCIS,fcj1x8j,t1_fcj1gad,1577675238.0,"Absolutely I am! Point being I have entered an extremely unique situation where a very beautiful and desirable woman has expressed feelings for me and me likewise. Normally in any relationship I enter it in hopes it ends up working out long term, so to enter this one makes me think further ahead and with more scrutiny because the costs of a potential LTR are much higher! I have more at stake."
seduction,exe2kfs,t3_csa6b1,1566195533.0,"I honestly think it’s not about how you act so much as being in the right place at the right time in a woman’s life. IE a coworker that may work with a girl intimately. Sure certain traits definitely help but you see enough women with complete losers to shatter the ‘it’s all about status’ myth. On the contrary though women won’t fall into your lap so you won’t win by being aloof and indifferent like PUAs advocate.

I use the example of Celine Dion and her old bald manager who was simply there alongside her on her personal journey to superstardom. It created rapport and love between them. It was certainly not his Herculean looks.

I personally think the best advice is to open up more windows to put yourself in a situation where you stumble and bumble into a situation where a woman is ready to receive a quality man. Join multiple dating apps, spin several plates at the same time. It keeps you from being fixated on one woman. Focus on your career, your wardrobe, smelling good, etc.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s you can’t convince a woman to fall for you. Throw out all the PUA books. She has to discover your worth like someone hearing a song on the radio that captures their interest. The dating market is so over saturated with options women aren’t impressed by money or looks because there’s so many options around that those things aren’t enough on their own to get you the girl. You have to have things that set you apart, like common interests, or work with them, or know them through a friend... things to make you cut ahead of the line of suitors. In that regard online dating is nearly futile and will likely only make you miserable. Good luck setting yourself apart from everybody else when it’s online. 

Put yourself in situations where women see your worth and uniqueness. Showcase a musical talent for example on Facebook. Post videos. Those type of things will cut you ahead of the horde.

And just focus on you and be the prize. Women will appreciate the 1 guy out of 10 who is the prize over the 9 putting her on a pedestal and wooing them with their income or the car they drive.

You don’t have to be fake or inauthentic to use simple science of the law of least effort to get ahead in dating."
