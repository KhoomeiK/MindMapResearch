FanTheories,febchka,t3_eo6uvu,1578957469.0,I absolutely love this!! Just shared it with one of my fellow HP friends. :D
depression,fddguyv,t1_fdcszoj,1578311699.0,Awe no problem friend. :) Have a great day
Anxiety,fdbteiq,t1_fdb5v6x,1578261752.0,"Same here. Relaxing, isn't it? It's amazing what a difference it made in just those 15min. Like I'm trying to not take so much of my Buspar just because I've been having a rough patch. It was nice to have some serenity with that nice walk."
tifu,fdbskz4,t1_fdb6niu,1578261341.0,"Did you miss the part where we'd all literally go extinct without it? 

And yes. There's lots of sex in the Bible. There's also stealing, rape, and murder. Newsflash, they're not all good people in there. That's kinda the whole point of being saved or whatever."
Konosuba,fdaxh72,t3_ekdd42,1578251546.0,This is adorable! Great job to both of you!!
tifu,fdawn86,t3_ekff1x,1578251228.0,"To be fair, religion set aside, seeing that would probably be a little uncomfortable. I mean, I walked in on my parents half naked getting ready to mount each other and I was damn near scarred for life. Perhaps it just put an unflattering image in his mind? Sex is perfectly normal regardless of your faith, but it was probably just the parenting aspect of ""oh wow, I didn't need to know about that, goodbye and get dressed  now"" lol."

medical,fdaai03,t3_ekcfey,1578243699.0,"At some point you might want to make sure your penis is structurally okay from the popping. I say this only because the tissue there differs in it from your hands. The penis is mainly just cartilage, so there are no bones there. It is possible to tear or ""break"" it, but it differs in that it would not be a ""bone break"". Rather, it could actually just be a separation or something. I'm not a doctor, but I've heard it can happen to people. Usually there are symptoms involved with this though. Idk, just a thought friend. Hopefully things are all well and good in that dept."
depression,fda9l7x,t1_fd6tt8q,1578243317.0,Thank you for proving that decent human beings still exist. :) This was very uplifting to read.
depression,fda8vcy,t3_ek3uky,1578243140.0,"I'm really sorry OP. It sounds like life was trying to tell you that you had two people really close to you that were really not honest with you at all in their intentions or about who they really were as people. It's a harsh thing to live through, and something that absolutely nobody deserves, but my hope is that you'll find better and more genuine people to help you through your dark times. Some people are just shitty human beings and really rotten friends. I used to get told that I was ""putting a lot on people"" but then I quickly learned as I got older that the people who were able to stick by me, really did love me. And I can tell you that there ARE people like that in the world. There are people who understand, listen, and even experience this as well. Depression/anxiety are not all that taboo anymore, and I think this is something that the world needs to understand. (Also people who cheat are usually dealing with their own insecurities/bs, let's be honest!)

Good luck to you. Take out that trash, wake up, look in the mirror, and realize that you are the one that deserves better. There is a huge planet full of people who could use a good friend like you."
explainlikeimfive,fcrc7xu,t1_fcrahrf,1577899869.0,This is also true lol

explainlikeimfive,fcqwrkk,t1_fcqtg2a,1577893394.0,lol you have a fair point. but it might be too dangerous to oversee. someone has to dispose of the corpse XD
7daystodie,fcp7m3i,t1_fcn4cvf,1577853156.0,I sort of thought the same. It's cute but ironic. I like it.
7daystodie,fcp7j7j,t1_fcn7wdi,1577853077.0,Oh wow I feel dumb. I thought she just used iron slabs.
7daystodie,fcp7gl3,t1_fcnt4i5,1577853005.0,"That's sweet. And I like how you say that in an objective an inclusive way, and not an agitated way. You two sound like a good pair. :)"
medical,fc5ju34,t3_egbgwi,1577459551.0,"Hmmm. Apparently it is called aquagenic uticaria. I have heard of uticaria before. It is quite rare!! It is when someone is allergic to their sweat. However, this gal has it much more severe since she cannot be exposed to water either. That sounds so awful, but my God is that fascinating. (Clinically this does not happen to many people!!)
I'm not a doctor, but I do wonder if they would treat her with immunosuppressants or stronger antihistamines to calm down the allergic response. The article stated it was unclear if she could grow out of it or not, since she is still so young. I really hope so. This would be the best outcome for her at this point. Even uticaria by itself causes a lot of issues. Patients with allergies to their own sweat break out in hives a lot. It's scary. :("
medical,fc5j7lb,t1_fc5fdvi,1577459077.0,Thanks - loved reading this answer!! I was quite curious about this.
7daystodie,fc5ifij,t3_eg81dp,1577458473.0,That's awesome!! :)
tifu,fc5hrhd,t1_fc4302n,1577457949.0,"Ok Boomer. Do you hear yourself?
The future isn't going anywhere. People are just sick of being put into little cookie cutter shapes, like the redundant houses that line any suburban neighborhood. And it's sad that you expect all people to live the same life without any hope of adventure. Newsflash: not everyone on earth is a white, straight, anglo-saxon protestant male. And why should they be? I grew up around enough of those people to know that we shouldn't be everything that ever existed. What a boring life. What a sad life. If you want that, go live it. But stop pushing it on people. YOU are squashing culture and diversity. So contrastly you are killing the future."
tifu,fc3yufu,t1_fc3yldh,1577402165.0,"Way to blame the female.

Her boyfriend could propose! Also why does it freaking matter? They seem happy enough."
StardewValley,fc3ygp5,t3_efuiyy,1577401880.0,That's incredible!!
medical,fc3yesk,t1_fc3xuvp,1577401840.0,"I can understand that. And in total honesty, I think it's a fairness to other clientele more so than a statement to their own convenience. Specialties of any kind tend to fill up VERY quickly and I know we have waitlists depending on the time of year."
medical,fc3y6td,t1_fc3aqnr,1577401676.0,"It kind of depends. Most will take over scripts temporarily in between waits (as you mentioned). There are some things that complicate this, usually controlled substances (risk) or things that require a specialist due to their education. (I.E. Accutane requires a certification to prescribe, so this will require a dermatologist. A primary care doctor most likely would not touch that prescription due to not having the required credentials.) I actually did not know this until quite recently."
medical,fc3x8bt,t3_efydod,1577400964.0,"I guess I just find that odd because I know the office I work at distinguishes between cancellations/no-shows. Most places have little tolerance for no-shows, but the fact that you called, I feel like should make a difference. It may just depend on whether the provider is a stickler on policy though. (Usually they get the final say.) 

I'm really sorry to hear about this. I hope you find someone who is more patient. It's hard to be in a tight situation like this when you really need the support. The suggestions here were good: follow up with insurance to see who is covered, make some calls/investigate reviews (or availability) online, and also make sure you don't require another referral.

As rotten as this is, perhaps this office did you a favor. Their lack of empathy/understanding makes me think they were not a good fit. I wish you luck at the next one. Hang in there."
StardewValley,fc3wczz,t3_efv3m6,1577400321.0,Awe. He is so wholesome. <3
