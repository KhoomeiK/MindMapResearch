Coronavirus,ffn2723,t1_ffmmg15,1580061180.0,I needed to read this today.  I’ve had a cold since before the news broke and of-course my anxiety filled ass is assuming the worse.  Thank you.
AskReddit,ffk7oa8,t3_eu2yh9,1580018307.0,Ensure my gun was handy at all times.  Share my location permanently with trusted people.  Practice clearing the house/deciding on exit strategies in an emergency.
AmItheAsshole,ffjx6ji,t3_eu13uc,1580009406.0,NAH.  Congrats on the engagement and also don’t fret too much.  Pregnancy makes us cry over some silly things.  Just remind her how much you love her and that you bought extras so she’d always know how much you loved her.  :)
Coronavirus,ffjv7if,t1_ffjv3hl,1580007863.0,And?  Literally most people had no idea wtf it was until recently.   Be a less shitty person.   Calling people retards makes you a jackass no matter what context.
Coronavirus,ffjuvew,t1_ffjucld,1580007597.0,That wasn’t his question.  He was asking if this existed 6 years ago since there was an identically named virus being reported on then.  You’re a jackass for calling people retards for trying to educate themselves.
Coronavirus,ffjteqz,t1_ffjtbsx,1580006444.0,Please do.  I’m soaking this up like a sponge.
