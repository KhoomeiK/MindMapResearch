Stay safe and good luck with all treatments upcoming."
bipolar,ffboaue,t3_eso93q,1579775462.0,"Great artwork! I'm really sorry you didn't get the support you were looking for. Good on you for taking control of your health, taking meds, and doing what works and is right for you!

I can somewhat commiserate. I wish I was artistic like you but my passions are mostly physical activity related. Because my outlet is exercise related, I exercise a decent amount naturally (maybe not the most of everyone but I'm currently running 15km/week, climbing 3x per week and doing 2-3 weight sessions per week, on top of weekend active activities, which is more than the average person I'd say and what I think is fairly good). I find the exercise helps a lot (one more tool in my tool box type thing) but it definitely does not ""solve"" the mood issues. I really struggle a lot of the time, especially in school and at work and I'm going back to the doctors now to get sorted with medication. Anyways, I also get this ""you just need to exercise and eat healthy, chin up and push through. Just try harder"" advice all the time from well meaning people and, while I appreciate the advice is well-intention-ed, sometimes I just want to go off on them... It's like bud, I already exercise way more than you thank you very much..."

I feel that too!"

bipolar,fdrj0k3,t1_fdn5fls,1578685172.0,"I get where youre coming from because I like to hide my issues and depression from others, including my parents, but for sure to get better you are going to need some help. It is really hard trying to get help by yourself. My dad, who is absolutely wonderful and who I am really close to, doesn't really get my issues but my mom does and I've been going to her a lot for support lately. The extra resource is very helpful especially when your mood is stopping you from thinking clearly

Edit: I think you should talk to someone (at minimum try to find a counselor) but, if your parents are loving, supportive, and caring to you, I really think you should get their help. It's uncomfortable and embarrassing and I also dislike people up in my business, but it's a chance to change how you are living as well and feel more stable and productive."
bipolar,fdpze2a,t1_fdn5fls,1578647232.0,Okay. Why do you not want them to care about you? You could always ask for space or privacy later on if it becomes an issue I think.

bipolar2,fdmf8c5,t3_em4u56,1578547928.0,"I think it's hard to say. I hated latuda and refuse to ever go back on it but I liked abilify and it worked for my thoughts and focus. So I guess everything is dependent on the individual. Good luck with the search. I'm stressed about re-starting meds soon after a year and a half hiatus too.

Edit: not sure why I said I was re-starting tomorrow. My next appointment isn't till next friday!"
bipolar2,fdfxq5q,t1_fddzeu8,1578373125.0,"I feel like so much went into the decision, it's hard to explain. I got diagnosed originally in hospital after suicide consideration (almost jumped off a building but didn't) combined with my symptoms and my family history. After I left hospitalization, the after care program seemed kind of reluctant to diagnose me officially with BP2 I think partially because I am younger, the lows are severe but my highs are not very pronounced (similar to other members of my family who have diagnosed bipolar 2), and I was having significant trouble with college and they felt that depression/suicidality was because I wasn't suited for college verses mental health issues. 

Despite the reluctance to diagnose me, I was put on mood stabilizers and anti-psychotics. I found every mood stabilizer/antipsychotic I tried didnt really get rid of the down feelings I was having completely. Instead of really really bad lows with some minor short highs mixed in (highs which I admittedly really enjoy), I just felt blah and uninspired and kind of sad/low energy all the time. I also was seeing a proscriber that didn't really listen to me. For example, she put me on seroquel and I didn't like it all at. I could only see her once every 3 or 4 weeks and after 2 appointments of her dismissing my concerns and upping the dosage, I decided I would stop taking the seroquel on my own. This also happened shortly after with a bunch of other medications, including latuda, as well earning me the moniker of ""med non compliant patient"". She also wouldn't justify any medications she wanted to put me on to me or explain what she was thinking so I felt kind of in the dark. I researched meds for a month and made a list and asked to try vyvanse or abilify because I was having trouble focusing on school and they were second line ADD treatments plus I found some testimonials where people said they felt semi depressed all the time on mood stabilizers and vyvanse helped.  I was then put on abilify, which I liked because it helped my thoughts be focused when I was depressed instead of constant rumination on unhelpful things and also helped stop some minor paranoia I was having, but it still left me feeling emotionally depressed. She then left for a new part of the country and was replaced by a new psychiatrist, who I liked but who was thinking I had depression instead. I was taken off the mood stabilizer and switched to wellbutrin for awhile which I felt didn't really do anything. I was then put on effexor instead and no mood stabilizer and was not followed up with at all for weeks. I think I became what everyone around me would describe as hypomanic- speeding excessively in my car to the point I would have gotten arrested if caught, excessively confident/sexual/outgoing, speaking without a filter, ended a 7 year relationship on somewhat of a whim, started 3 new sexual relationships (and one that was somewhat high risk) immediately after though I am a fairly conservative individual, threw away an entire university semester by not going to school and deciding not to do assignments suddenly when I previously had 80 to 90% in every class. I stopped taking effexor 1 month in because I couldn't orgasm which was frustrating at the time because I could not stop thinking about sex and being sexual and I assumed abandoning school and my former monogamous, low risk self had led me to now become a happy and free individual cured of my former depressing life. After I stopped taking effexor, I had a day or two of sweating and then became devastated over my relationship ending, my school semester, and the life I had lived for a month to the point that I had a breakdown culminating in drinking a bottle of 35% proof alcohol and calling my best friend while vomiting and blacking out and apparently crying on the phone while saying I wanted to die though I have zero recollection of this because of said alcohol. She lives a full days drive away so she sent her mum to my house and my dad also came home concerned. Everyone said ""you need help"" to me.... I felt really dysfunctional and out of control and this lead me to conclude maybe I was worse off on meds because I couldnt control myself. 

I straightened up shortly after that with sheer willpower and with the help of my profs and some lucky extensions. I finished my semester and worked full time over the summer with moderate success though I was late for work a few times because I was having a hard time leaving bed in the mornings. The depression definitely made it hard some days but my work was also outdoors and very physically active which I think helped. I went to see the psychiatrist and psychologist a few months later and they both said that my behavior on effexor was normal i.e. that people outgrow old relationships and then rebound all the time. I let them talk me into it. The psychiatrist then said ""what do you want from me?"" I said, ""I don't know. I'm kind of scared to take meds."" And he was like ""well okay. I agree you might not need meds. Lets see how not taking meds goes. Come in if you need help."" Then I met with my psychologist another time in an appointment where I said I was still sometimes suicidal. Psychologist asked if I had a plan and I detailed my ideal way to die (which was somewhat impractical to be fair because the supplies would have been difficult to source) and he said he was relived and to come in in 3 weeks again. 3 weeks later, another appointment and no suicide was mentioned and we talked about sleep. I said sometimes I sleep 15 hours and I find it hard to stay awake- even if I get out of bed on time I then nap or fall asleep. He essentially said I needed more willpower to keep a sleep routine. I said I didn't think it was willpower because some days I only needed 1 or 2 hours of sleep and I didnt feel tired at all. He again said if I got a regular sleep routine it wouldnt happen. That was my last appointment- I felt I was wasting my time, these people didnt really understand my issues, and my issues probably aren’t that severe or else they'd act more concerned. 

Fast forward, Sept 2019 I entered part time work and a really hard uni semester unmedicated and start getting severe mood swings from the stress and slowly started to self-neglect (more fast food, lack of sunlight and exercise, lack of sleep due to school work and work work). School and work both got overly stressful suddenly  and it spiraled out of control. At my peak, I slept 2.5 hrs one weekend in total and didn't feel tired allowing me to finish an entire neuro presentation in 20 hours that I presented the following Monday morning on only 2.5hrs of sleep for 2 days for an entire class. I also worked my job for 6 hours and cleaned my entire house all in that 2 day time span. At my worst, I bought all the supplies to kill myself and came close to going through with it multiple times with each time getting a little bit closer. I decided if I didn't get help, I was probably going to try to end my life fairly soon as I was slowly working up the courage and becoming increasingly convinced it was an option worth trying. I e-chatted the distress center in my area and asked them for a counseling recommendation. They recommended a place where master's students do their practicum and I was paired up with one such student. I filled out an intake form and, by the grace of God, I got in the next day and started seeing this counselor who I think is incredible. Bit by bit she helped me open up and also saw me 3 times a week for a few weeks and noticed mood swings as well. Now she's helping me to go see a different psychiatrist again because she thinks I need medication. I trust her and I think she's right but it's a big step and I'm scared. I'm trying to come to accept medication is what I for sure want before my psychiatry appointment in 2 weeks. 

I'm still pretty ""functional"" on the outside mostly I'd say but sometimes when I haven't showered for a week and suddenly it takes a calculated effort to do the dishes or I suddenly stop sleeping and run around the house basically screaming random ideas I do wonder if I need some med support.  I don't know how others are or live so i don't think I'm THAT dysfunctional but many around me think I need help including my new counselor and I do feel I'm constantly trying to out think or out work my mental state whether it's trying to slow myself down and not show too much energy so people don't think I'm weird or tricks to try and study and focus on school while sleeping 15 hours and while feeling weepy and being inundated with negative thoughts on how stupid and worthless I am constantly."

bipolar2,fdcv19k,t1_fdctyin,1578285111.0,Helpful to know it took 7 years. I've been struggling for the last 7 years with some not so helpful practitioners. My one practitioner just dropped me and told me I was suppose to have found the right combo after a year. It hurt me to hear that as I'd been seeing them for 3 years and making very little progress (they can only book me in once every 2 or 3 months so I didnt see them that much). I got really down on myself for that for a while until I met a new and awesome counselor who is trying to get me in to see someone new.
bipolar2,fdcuqpq,t1_fdcu7cn,1578284873.0,"Thank you for this detailed summary. It's very helpful. 

I think I'm reaching that point as well feeling a bit like I'm between a rock and a hard place. I don't like the side effects or trial and error of medication and I am terrified of the meds themselves long term but I am also reaching a point where I think I'm not going to be able to have the life I want without them. Thanks again"

Neuroscience is an extremely hard program. I  felt I had no way out too so I  get that but don't get discouraged. I'm going for treatment in a few weeks, and thinking about online school. Online courses I have taken have had a lot of benefits for me because I can schedule my own deadlines and work at my own pace ensuring I only work a set amount of hours a day. Don't give up!"
