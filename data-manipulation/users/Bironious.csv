todayilearned,fgn32yv,t1_fgmsrfn,1580936762.0,"Well one of the only canon things we have about the Joker is that he was an unfunny failed comedian. As with emotional extremes and how the mentally ill feel sometimes in only extremes, the going from nihilistic desperate rage to innocently giddy daydreamer seems as it could be on point with that. Not to say that intelligence is not prone to ones emotional state, it very much is but my point is also that intelligence is independent of mental illness of behaviors but one's behavior can very much be influenced by mental illness more than intelligence at times"
todayilearned,fgms12d,t1_fgmq927,1580930877.0,"Lack of sleep, paranoia, fear or even just plain Jane anxiety could account for those easily. I have issues with mental health and I think something that really gives the characterization room to breath is that the extremes in emotion he reaches hardly ever match up to the reality of the current situation but when they do he can't/doesn't hold back and learns he likes it because it gives him a feeling of control over them. This  is how mental illness can really be for many and those extremes no matter how intelligent a person can lead to a tunnel vision or hyper ADD type of state of being that may or may not come in cycles. I wouldn't say those are indications of low IQ"

How is it that none of these clowns involved with the press are getting this? Seriously frustrating to me that this is so obviously yet everyone on tv or in media seem oblivious to this fact. Biden will lose against trump for the same reasons and way HRC lost to trump. Oh also the young minorities did not show up for HRC like they did for Obama. Those aren't your swing voters(swing voters are the anti-dem establishment ones) exactly but they make a huge difference. Now the DNC is getting some well deserved criticism for their handling (or ""rigging"") of the Iowa caucuses.
