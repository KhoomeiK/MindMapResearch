Pets,ffpd32l,t1_ffme7we,1580092029.0,"He is 9 months old, so still very young, but old enough that any of our no whining training should have started working. The problem is he LIKES to whine. I think the noise intrigues him. 

The test puzzle toy I will definitely try to find. He is a major chewer and had destroyed even the toughest, most durable toys I can find. He doesn't really like much though. If he knows it's his he doesn't want it as much."
Pets,ffmc9u1,t3_eu7qg6,1580052293.0,"Yeah I've definitely had shock collars(some have like a lemon spray too instead that seemed better) on my mind, but the thought makes me feel horrible. I like your tactic though rewarding him for stopping isn't something I had even thought of stupidly. My only problem is the first one. See his biggest thing is that he will wake up before us and we wake up because suddenly he is howling and whining and then basically screaming. So maybe I will have to just put him to sleep with a shock collar on so he stops in the mornings. He has no problem with separation really and he is wonderfully crate trained. Incredibly smart dog, I just think he LIKES to whine and everything which is horrendous for me."
Pets,ffmaosj,t3_etrmpm,1580051451.0,Made them deal with being under the same roof and fed them together. Normally they get dry food(still in one nowl) and when we busted out wet food as a nice treat we would get them to eat closer and closer. I wouldn't call them best buds but sometimes they play together etc. Some cats really hit it off though. As long as you can get them to accept this is both of their homes and you're the one taking care of them anyway they normally mellow out. Basically give them reasons to be around each other that are not forced.

Same for fire grab my coat on my way out. My biggest concern is my animals. If it's a fire I don't give a flying shit if I'm outside naked as long as my pets are safe.
