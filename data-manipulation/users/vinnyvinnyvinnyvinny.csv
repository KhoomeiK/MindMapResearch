Libertarian,ffc2xux,t1_ffbi4z4,1579790225.0,That’s not very conservative of you. A true American conservative would be very concerned with what people do in the privacy of their own homes (especially the bedroom).
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff9lnwk,t1_ff95baj,1579715606.0,"Damn. Ok to be fully honest... I had one that was disappointing. I always go for the “entire place to yourself” because I don’t wanna have to be quiet or run into people. I didn’t read the description. It was like a garage/shed they turned into a livable space. I had to walk down a driveway and go past the house to get to it. 10 mins after check in I was banging my girlfriend while some kid was playing in the backyard. I mean the kid obviously didn’t see or hear anything, just kind of weird. Only saw the owners once. It was actually pretty nice set up inside."

dataisbeautiful,ff6ieq1,t1_ff5fg6m,1579627865.0,I don’t understand all the comments about guys talking about how little sex they have saying being old caused it... and be like 32 years old. Nothing has slowed down for me and I’m 37. Maybe it’s a relationship thing? Maybe your libido slows down if you’re with the same woman for years? Idk but I think it’s weird.

If you put it on the bottom, depending on the design of the bag, you might put that weight at your lower back and hips. Just think about the mobility you have when you carry something on your shoulders vs weight on your belt or lower back. Not saying I know everything, just saying I’ve done it both ways and this is what I found."
