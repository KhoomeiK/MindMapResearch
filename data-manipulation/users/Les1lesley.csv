AmItheAsshole,ffr4f6h,t1_ffqwcqf,1580150226.0,"Nonsense.  
I gave my husband an Instant Pot for Xmas. If he refused to let anyone else in the family use it it would make him an unreasonable asshole.  
If an item like a large instrument, furniture or television is kept in a common living area, it is for communal use, regardless of who technically owns it."
AmItheAsshole,ffr3r3s,t1_ffr0s7d,1580149810.0,"Even if you take away the family angle, you can’t take away the shared accommodation angle. That’s imperative to this situation.  
And my opinion on that is that *who* the asshole is would be entirely dependent on the item being used and *why* permission is being denied.  
If the item were something kept exclusively in a common area, like, say, a television, and the owner refused to let their roommates watch it, I’d say he was an unreasonable asshole.  
If the item was something more personal, like a gaming chair for example, and kept in the individuals private living space, then using it after being denied permission would be an asshole move.  

An instrument, like drums or a piano, kept exclusively in a shared living space, definitely falls into the first category."
AmItheAsshole,ffeodhb,t1_ffe7l6i,1579857227.0,"I used to be a closed captioning trascriptionist, and I did the captioning for A LOT of porn. It was so unbelievably tedious. Every single “ooh ya”, “mmm” and “you like that?” had to be transcribed verbatim. Not just the “scripted” dialogue. No skipping to the money shot.  
It was so boring too. Very repetitive and obnoxious. I’d caption parliament meetings any day over 2000’s era porn.  
Now, 70s/80s porn on the other hand were much more entertaining. They were basically just movies, with story lines, plots, character development, etc, and just happened to have real sex in them.

ETA “sex noises” was actually supposed to be “repetitive squelching” or “wet slapping”. Not allowed to describe anything as “sounds” or “noises”."
AmItheAsshole,ff9j5gz,t1_ff9ha3q,1579714124.0,"See, at least in your situation, each kid was given the opportunity to earn their reward. My parents, on the other hand, bribed my sister to try to get better grades, and when I asked why I didn’t get rewarded, I was told that, for me, good grades were “expected, not rewarded”. That rewards were for going above and beyond expectations."

AmItheAsshole,felgujx,t1_feldxp9,1579221854.0,"That episode was probably the best of the series. Given the genre, her death was just so... mundane. Which made it even more harrowing because it was *relatable*. The scene when Anya tries to process the death breaks me every time."
AmItheAsshole,felfoxo,t1_fel6f4j,1579221080.0,"I’m with you. I have very explicit instructions in my will that I do not under any circumstances want a funeral or memorial service, and that only my immediate family members may be allowed to view my body if they wish to for goodbyes.  
There’s no way I would ever want my loved ones missing out on a joyous occasion to mourn me or to damage their relationships because they thought someone wasn’t mournful enough."
AmItheAsshole,fei01o2,t1_fehr7vb,1579127355.0,"> So instead of ""Don't ask people about their bills cause it's rude,"" 

This is a perfectly valid reason to give a child, or anyone, to not ask people about their bills.  
It *is* rude.  
People are entitled to privacy, and it’s rude to violate that. You can explain *why* being rude is unacceptable, but “because it’s rude” is absolutely an acceptable reason to give a child when told to stop doing something."

AmItheAsshole,fdo32g3,t1_fdmtgad,1578597991.0,"This is pretty much how poached chicken made it to our weekly rotation too. One of our dogs has GERD, so we had to start supplementing half her kibble with brown rice to keep her acid levels down. She didn’t care for the rice, and would manage to just root around it for the kibble. So, we started adding boneless/skinless chicken to the rice, and then pulsing it in the food processor to make a sort of porridge to pour over the kibble. She gobbles it up like doggy crack now.  
So, now we’ve always got poached chicken and rice in the fridge, ready to go when we don’t have any other ideas for dinner."
AmItheAsshole,fdo27bk,t1_fdmc6eg,1578597531.0,"Properly poached chicken is delicious. It’s basically combining the brining and cooking process. The meat is juicy, perfectly seasoned and absolutely delectable. Plus, you can use the poaching liquid for anything you’d use broth/stock for. I like to use it to cook the veg/rice side dish for the chicken, but it also makes a great soup/stew base."
AmItheAsshole,fdjasl8,t1_fdj5qru,1578463564.0,">  To distort an *imbalance* of thought with *thoughtlessness*

An imbalance of thought is *as hurtful* as thoughtlessness when a parent is consistently more thoughtful towards one child than another, which OP has stated is the case.  
Your posts are coming across extremely dismissive of how hurtful blatant parental favouritism can be. OP is routinely given less than his stepbrother, both materially and emotionally. The disparity between what OP and his stepbrother are given isn’t justifiable simply because  *you* view what OP’s been given as sufficient. $600 is insufficient solely due to the ongoing imbalance in treatment of the siblings.  

Forget money and material items. If OP was upset because his father only hugged him once a month, while making a show of hugging his brother several times per day, by your logic, OP is still receiving *some* affection and thus should not be upset. This is really no different than what OP is upset about."
AmItheAsshole,fdj4c7h,t1_fdijkcv,1578458096.0,"> Or maybe it was just a brain-fart, and with the pressure of the holidays he didn't PREDICT HOW YOU WOULD FEEL... The point being, you are acting like you feel snubbed because he WANTED you to feel bad. 

*Thoughtless* actions are almost always far more hurtful than malicious ones. At least with malicious intent you can write that person off as a asshole. It cuts far deeper when someone hurts you because you don’t even register on their radar.  
OPs dad didn’t predict how his kid would feel because it never occurred to him to even think about it. OPs feelings never even entered his mind.  
Knowing that your feelings are not even a passing thought to your own father is *far* more hurtful than being intentionally treated unfairly."
fatlogic,fde5nwp,t1_fddy9dw,1578331725.0,"> Some things are definitely not **fine** though

Not true. If it’s edible^[1] it’s *fine*. “Fine” does not equal “Healthy/Good”.  
Even things that are unhealthy can be *fine* in small amounts.  
There is a big, thick line between “good for you” and “inedible”, and that line is called  “*Fine in moderation*”. There isn’t anything wrong with consuming calories that are devoid of nutrition in limited quantities. Even objectively bad foods can be *fine* in extremely limited quantities.


1. “Edible” defined as “safe for eating, non-lethal or causing irreversible injury/damage”"

You’d only see the markup you’re talking about if you compare Walmart straight size clothing to dedicated plus size store clothing. Compare like-to-like and you’ll see there’s typically a rather small  markup between sizes."
AmItheAsshole,fckqd59,t1_fcknky2,1577730919.0,"Anger is absolutely justified. Not about the haircut, about the lack of communication.   
She said she was getting a haircut, and then got a buzz cut. No woman with long curly hair refers to a buzz cut as just a haircut. She intentionally downplayed her intentions because she knew he wouldn’t be a fan and went the “it’s better to seek forgiveness than permission” route. In other words, she lied.  
It’s perfectly justifiable to be angry when your spouse misleads you. And if they’re willing to be coy and shady about something as trivial as a haircut, what else are they willing to skirt the truth about?"
AmItheAsshole,fckmkqs,t1_fckja9l,1577728590.0,"A haircut and a buzz cut are two totally different things. Especially on a person who has always had long hair. I’ve been with my husband since high school, and he’s never *not* had facial hair. I’d be incredibly angry with him if he said he was thinking of trimming his full beard and just showed up one day with a soul patch.   
Yeah, his face, his choice. But, just because it’s his right to make those choices without consulting me doesn’t mean my anger wouldn’t be justified at him for doing it.  
Communication is the most important part of any long term relationship. I wouldn’t be angry about him shaving per se, I’d be angry that he didn’t value or respect me enough to honestly inform me about his intentions. 

OPs wife doesn’t *need* permission to cut her hair. But that doesn’t mean that her choice to not effectively communicate won’t have consequences."
