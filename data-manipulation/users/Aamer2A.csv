As a 4 year I fell from a cupboard while trying to get chalks that were kept on top of it and fractured my arm

In 6th grade me and my friends were playing a game of who can throw their shoe the highest, I threw my shoe in the air and it landed in someone's window on the first floor of a building. The windows had guard rails on them which I used to climb up to threw first floor and get my shoe but suddenly whoever was in that flat decided to open the window, I got shocked and left the guard rails and fell all the way down and landed straight on my legs, it hurt like a bitch, I didn't get fractured but I couldn't walk for two days

In 4th grade I asked my friend for a pencil and he threw it at me, the nip of the pencil went straight into my palm and had to be removed by a doctor

In 8th grade I was playing football, we were playing bare foot for some reason,  this one guy was playing with shoes, I don't what had happened exactly but this guy did something while playing and half of my toe nail came off"
