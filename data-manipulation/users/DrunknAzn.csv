Guitar,ff55qui,t3_dr29s1,1579581000.0,"I haven't played my acoustic guitar in a year and I recently got back into it again. 



I have a problem with a note sounding really scratchy when I play with a capo on, it won't play. All the other notes around it sounds fine except for that one. It sounds like the scratch is coming from the bridge pins, but those are pretty tight (I think). 



The strings to my guitar are really close to the frets too, could it be something with the truss rod? I've never messed with it before.


Any help is appreciated!"

For some reason it was really dark in the hallway. My Dad called for me and crouched down as if to give me a hug, so I went to give him one.


I ran through him. I turned around confused, he was at the other end of the hallway! He was still in the crouching position and called for me again. I ran to him without thinking and it happened again!! He was back on the other end and I was back near my room door.


I remember the chills and fear as my *Dad* called for me again. Something wasn't right, the little light bulb in my head dinged. Why was the hallway so dim? Why couldn't I reach him? I did a quick about face into my room and hid under the blankets til I knocked out."
