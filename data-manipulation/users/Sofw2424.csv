EDanonymemes,ffj0esp,t1_ffhpvv5,1579987236.0,"Dude I'm 5""3' and I need to eat 1500 calories to maintain a healthy weight, that is definitely not an okay amount for you"
EDanonymemes,ffj0agu,t1_ffi2s13,1579987150.0,My mom also told me something similar but I was 4 and it was for ballet
EDanonymemes,ffj0815,t3_etnkwk,1579987099.0,"""your so pretty but if you lost 10kg you'd be prettier""
""you don't wanna be like the ugly fat kid right??""
""Why can't you be like your sister and just not eat junk food!!""
""Sweety, you are just too fat to do ballet""

All quotes from my mom, I was struggling with self image when I heard the first one, heard it multiple times, reallllllyyyyy fucked me up, the second one was told to my sister multiple times before and during her times in kindergarten, lead her to develop an eating disorder and to almost being hospitalised, the third one was told to me but was referencing the time my sister developed her ED and stopped eating all and any fast food and lastly the one my mom told me when I was.... 4 years old, was going to swimming lessons weekly, ran around outside on a daily basis and had a very small and almost non existent appetite do to some problems that later were fixed by a surgery at the age of 6, so yeah thanks mom, maybe me and my sister would have both developed ED's do to other reasons that would not be related to you but you sure did help the process go a whole lot fucking faster!!"

london,fdh7dmk,t1_fdh669d,1578416976.0,"I understand that moderate and severe scoliosis is obviously a disability but I mean for people like me that sure we can stand, but not for long and if we do stand for long our backs start hurting faster then other people's back and also the placing of the curve (like mine is at the bottom of the spine which according to my doctor is the most painful place to have a curve at) can really affect the level of pain
I'm just kinda confused because if mild scoliosis is considered a disability then am I considered a disabled person?? It just sounds weird"
london,fdh60d2,t3_ekvgzd,1578416124.0,"I wonder if someone with scoliosis would be called disabled? 
Like someone in my case who's lower spine curves but since it happens to not be too extreme doctors say a surgery just isn't necessary however I do suffer from a lot of back pain, do you guys think that would qualify?"

And yeah it is kinda brainwashing since a lot of religious figures use their position of power to abuse or take advantage of others, it just doesn't make sense to think that if you have sex before marriage you are less then others that have not done that and if you follow all does rules without question even if you don't necessarily agree with them all in fear that this mythical entity that you have never seen any evidence of actually existing will punish you for all eternity"
