Would let the patient know you have tried to advocate for them (even if you don’t actually think they need more pain meds) and still deny them. I think the response if they bring up leaving could be “if you do actually want to leave AMA that is absolutely your choice” and provide information if they want it.

Exercise,fbxjkrm,t3_eex9o3,1577190569.0,"I’m going to share what worked for me starting out, hope the advice helps. I started with walking. I walked at a speed that I could do for 30 minutes and worked up a sweat by the end. I started to add incline and did intervals at a faster walking pace. This went on for about 5 months with increasing time and speed (not both at the same time). I was able to use that as my form of exercise primarily with occasional elliptical and biweekly general weight lifting to add variety. 

Then I went home for the summer and started to try out jogging. It started with a lot of short bouts of jogging and a lot of walking in between. By the time I was halfway through summer break I could run 2 miles outside in the heat without a break. 

Now I’m not super consistent, but ever since then I’ve been able to pick up jogging and can work up to a 5k with no breaks within a week or two of starting back up consistently again. Even if I don’t work out for a few weeks at all, I’m able to jump on the treadmill and jog a good chunk of the time."
