You're welcome to do a quick scholar search. The short answer is that generally harsher sentences DO NOT deter crime. This isn't new info. Some crimes it does somewhat work, but not really. 


It doesn't matter how widespread wrongful convictions are(about 12% in sexual assault, 6% across the board, sourced in other comments but [easy to google](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2018/sep/4/study-finds-wrongful-convictions-116-percent-sexual-assault-cases-pre-dna-testing-era/)), they happen across the board at a high enough rate that this punishment will wind up costing innocent people their future families. Those lawsuits will be MASSIVE. That's your tax dollars going to waste on a punishment that doesn't work. Those tax dollars are already being wasted sterilizing people, add on the lawsuits. 

So we've established that harsher punishment doesn't deter crime. We've established that wrongful convictions in sexual assault are 2x the average in the US.

Now, what some states and countries have done is give convicted criminals the voluntary option to castrate or sterilize. They sign off on it."
