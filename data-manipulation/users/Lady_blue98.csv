My bus was at 7.20am with the bus stop 10 minutes away by car. The school was one hour away by bus. 
My mom drove me to the bus stop and we waited a few minutes before she had to go to drive her 40 minutes to work in another direction.
We stay in the car to stay warm for sure.
So yeah sometimes parents have 5 minutes they can spend in the car with their child but they can't bring them to school if it's a little far, doesn't open before they have to drive to work, work is in another direction, etc etc."
