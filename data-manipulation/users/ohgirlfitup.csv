In other words, how important is it that, say, 99% of scientists agree that humans contribute to climate change, when millions of people still deny its existence? This is where social sciences become more important, because they help us understand *why* people do what they do, even in the face of hard evidence."

Similarly, consumers are whole-heartedly dependent on cheap plastic. As a result of this dependency, the plastic industry produces over 300 million tons of the inexpensive material per year (Plastic Oceans International). Given certain regional laws on plastic recycling, among other factors, consumers recycle only nine-percent of the 8.3 billion tons of plastic on Earth (GuglielmiJul). Many scientists estimate that humans will have created a total of 26 billion tons of plastic waste by the year 2050 (GuglielmiJul). With so much of this plastic waste residing in the oceans, its presence currently endangers over 800 different marine species (Reddy), many of which are already endangered (Mambra). Marine life often mistake the plastic for food, causing them to perhaps choke or even die. The mass death of these species can cause an imbalance in the ecosystem, resulting in the excess of other species, or the disappearance of other species entirely. Plastic pollution poses a serious risk to more than just marine life, but to human health on a global scale as well. Marine fish such as tuna or halibut, a popular choice of food, consume millions of microplastics before they end up on our dinner table, and subsequently in our mouths. Despite the ease of use and cheap price, plastic poses a threat to all life on Earth."

If you get into an accident and the airbag deploys, your thumbs will be forced backwards, a direction they’re not made to go.

Needless to say, and being as close to the wheel as I am given my short stature, I drive with my thumbs resting on the wheel instead."
