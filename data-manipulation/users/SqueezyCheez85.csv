I expected the worst... but after using it, I had zero issues. Even with turning my head side to side as fast as I could I couldn't see any black bars failing to keep up. 

The quality was nice too. I was playing Boneworks. No noticable input lag. I have a 3700X with a 5700 flashed to an XT. I also used the debug tool with the settings recommended by Oculus for a ""2070+"" graphics card. I didn't notice any video compression at all.
