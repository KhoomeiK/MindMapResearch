None of the original SimCity games are built building by building."

Where do people keep pulling this nonsense from?  He does not pay a smaller percentage of tax than someone in the middle class.  Unless you mean he pays a smaller percentage of his net worth every year, then yes.  Because he has more assets.  BUT THAT'S NOT HOW TAXES WORK."

MurderedByWords,fencnsd,t1_femvcqu,1579281844.0,"I'm a CPA, but not the original one.

Whole Foods may be making the actual donation, but they can't claim it on their taxes unless they first recognize the cash receipts as revenue - which would increase their taxable income by the same amount as they're donating, effectively meaning there is no net impact to their tax liability/expense.

Scenario A:
Customer gives $10 to Whole Foods to donate.  Whole Foods donates the $10, but is not able to claim it as a tax write off.

Scenario B:
Customer gives $10 to Whole Foods to donate.  Whole Foods recognizes the $10 as revenue before donating it.  Whole Foods donates the $10, and now claims the $10 as a tax write-off, reducing their taxable income by $10 - but it has already increased its taxable revenue by the $10 that was donated.  Net zero impact to their taxes.

In either scenario the outcome is the same."
