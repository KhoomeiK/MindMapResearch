college,fdomz5v,t1_fdlfaz3,1578608443.0,"I was wrong. Accidentally said 1k a year instead of 1k a semester. I don’t want you to think i was speaking out of my ass, i went to cc but i did make a mistake. Sorry."
college,fdomvf1,t1_fdmei3r,1578608381.0,"Ya idk what i was on lmao, i went to cc myself but mistakenly said 1k a year instead of 1k a semester. My bad for the misinformation."
college,fdkzu37,t3_elxzd9,1578514533.0,"I think you are overloading yourself but as you said you are past that point. 

My advice would be to keep the momentum going when it’s going and to try and have at least one full day off a week to rest. 

Knock as many things as you can at a time or do as many tasks as you can and try to save Sunday’s for yourself. Even if you have to study every now and then on a Sunday for a test, it would be better to dedicate it to yourself than to book yourself every single day. Personally i would rather work 9am-11pm so i don’t have to do anything the next day rather than working 6 hours per day. You may be the opposite though so take the advice with a grain of salt and good luck."
college,fdkxc7z,t3_elxooc,1578513093.0,"What do you regret ? The degree itself? Your college experience? The cost? 

Imo if you only had to go to cc to find a career that makes you money and happy then your way ahead of the curve. 1 year of cc is less than 1k where I’m at and 2k for an associates degree isn’t a waste at all."
BeautyGuruChatter,fdezhx4,t1_fdcm84b,1578349919.0,"I work for a wedding venue, my last room flip was Saturday. 

Usually the tables are ready with as many decorations on it that wont fall over in another room and carried in during cocktail hour. Then we have probably 10 people doing finishing touches for the hour (adding the flower vases, fixing the silverware etc.). 

I saw another comment that said it takes weeks of planning and i guess maybe my managers do that??? But from my experience a room flip is very typical and we don’t need much planning."
teenagers,fckn49s,t1_fckm4s8,1577728916.0,"She went to a party where her ex boyfriends brother said that if OPs friend was hot in the past, ex boyfriend should’ve dated her instead of OP. OPs friend said some bullshit that it was a joke and she is prettier than OP. All of this hurt OPs feelings. 

To op: you have a right to be upset, your friend sounds like a jerk and you seem to have a bad history from like 7th grade?¿ i think it’s better to just cut your losses, these people don’t seem like good friends. Wish you the best."

teenagers,fckjs2f,t3_ehot0n,1577726865.0,"Uhh idk i think you should just be real. Y’all aren’t dating so she shouldn’t be your #1 priority and telling her that will just enable this kind of behavior. Did you want to quit the game after 10 minutes to play with her or did you want to finish your match? Either answer is okay but don’t tell her what you think she wants to hear, just be honest."
teenagers,fckjde6,t3_ehou46,1577726612.0,"Kinda lame answer but you should genuinely just write and not worry about the word count. After you finish getting your thoughts out at the very least, check your word count and try to be at between 750-1000 words and then start editing. Iirc i was told they read so many essays and they can tell when you’re just putting fluff to get to the word count. The 1500 is a MAX because that don’t need to read more than that. You don’t need to write that much. 50-75% of the max seems good imo, and focusing on the content vs word count is your best bet. Good luck!"
