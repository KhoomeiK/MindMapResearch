Oh this white actor did really well but we should ignore that because we need a black actor to have a Oscar to make it more diverse. Like tf if no black actors did that good then oh fucking well who the fuck is saying they can’t get an Oscar.

AskReddit,fdprt3p,t1_fdofom0,1578638033.0,"There was a girl that was going through a break up that I knew so I hung out with her as much as I could to make her feel better. A couple days before she attempted suicide she said “guess I’ll go home and kill myself” which I responded to her with “well now I gotta go home with you to make sure you don’t” in a half joking tone but she laughed it off. I felt extremely guilty after I heard what happened after that like I could have done something different. I spent an entire semester helping her get back on her feet and feel good about herself and it took all of my sympathy away. This put me through some depression myself that I never got help for because I didn’t want to feel like a burden to an already depressed person. I promise you people joking about killing themself is just a way of coping, teen suicide is real and it’s ignored but the best way to help them cope is to let them joke about it and let them be above those horrible thoughts."
