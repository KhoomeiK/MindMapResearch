TrueCrime,fgl4780,t1_fgl01fi,1580881474.0,A lot of criminals are arrogant and stupid. They get caught because they do stupid things thinking they are smarter than everyone else. Not saying that was a body hanging out of the tote but it’s not out of the realm of possibilities.
TrueAskReddit,fgjm7z6,t1_fgixazf,1580846922.0,This is an awesome answer and very enlightening.
TrueCrimeDiscussion,fghni5g,t3_eyfwkl,1580788916.0,"One thing that makes me doubt the parents did it is that usually when something like this happens and police are putting pressure on, they would break and turn on each other. Especially if it was an accidental thing and one was angry at the other for hurting her. So I don’t know. I feel like the police probably got their sights on the parents and tried to twist the evidence to fit that story and lost traction in any other direction they could have investigated."
Thetruthishere,fghk1hi,t1_ffhsy3a,1580786573.0,"You aren’t wrong except that dogs in puppy mills do suffer as much as animals in factory farms. Probably more so because the factory farms at least have some sort of regulation they have to adhere to. 

I guess people have a more personal connection to dogs so it’s not really selective but most people don’t have a pet cow to compare conditions to. 

Each of these issues deserves attention and action. You can’t do everything at once so every little step in helping animals out of bad situation is a good thing. It’s not hypocrisy to focus on one facet of an issue that needs attention."

NoStupidQuestions,fgg6yjf,t1_fgg0keq,1580755583.0,"I think you’re reading a lot into what they said. They didn’t infer ANY of that. I have never asked for a child’s menu or asked for special treatment when going to a restaurant that didn’t serve chicken tenders. However, most chain restaurants DO have them on their adult menus. If you’re speaking of going to a specialized, smaller restaurant like Italian or Mexican, yeah they probably won’t."
NoStupidQuestions,fgfzaxe,t1_fgfb2fj,1580750865.0,"Literally no one said anything about ONLY eating chicken tenders and French fries. If there is something else on the menu that I like, I’ll pick that. But if there isn’t, I go with my chicken tenders standby. Also, my kids are grown adults now and have a much wider palate range than I do. I made sure to introduce them to different foods even if didn’t like them myself. The world is not so one dimensional as you are trying to make it."

Someone to help with cleaning, caring for the kids, supporting each other emotionally. Basically like being married to a BFF girlfriend.

TrueCrimeDiscussion,fg0rxlk,t1_fg0p6s4,1580413832.0,"I have a lot of problems with this. First of all, is there scientific evidence that it is higher testosterone levels that lead to pedophilia or rape? I would think it is more of a mental illness issue rather than a testosterone issue. Is there proof that she no longer has the thoughts of wanting to rape children? You don’t need a penis to molest someone, obviously.  I don’t think these issues should be based on gender or sexual orientation. This person committed multiple crimes against children and that history alone should be what determines their likelihood to do it again. In short, I believe she will rape again."

creepyencounters,ffzbwyq,t3_evpfx3,1580371442.0,I hear weird stories like this from my niece who uses those apps as well. It’s surreal to me as someone who has been married for 24 years. I never encountered such bizarre inappropriateness from guys when I was dating. It really makes me feel for anyone trying to just put themselves out there and have any kind of normal social life these days.

TrueCrime,ffso1wc,t3_euyta8,1580186745.0,I think possibly the worst part is that the Apple store employees that were working next door heard everything and didn’t lift a finger to call police or do anything to help.
TooAfraidToAsk,ffsnuz2,t3_euyjq8,1580186582.0,I’m 43 and still afraid of the dark. I don’t get embarrassed by it anymore. I don’t know why it’s the one fear that people seem to think is childish or you should get over when you’re an adult. Scary shit happens in the dark. lol
TooAfraidToAsk,ffsnh75,t3_euylod,1580186258.0,"I had a deeply sad reaction to the death of Steve Irwin. It still makes me so sad to think that he is gone. I really don’t know why it effects me so strongly. I guess his spirit came through the tv and left an impression on me. He seemed so happy and passionate to just be alive. 

I get sad over some musicians deaths too. If their music has been a big part of my life, I grew up as a fan, etc. 

Also having empathy for their families. Kobe had 3 other daughters and he seemed like a great father. Steve Irwin too. So putting yourself in their place, you can’t help but feel devastated for them. 

I don’t know. I guess part of it is looking at our own mortality. If these bigger than life people can die, it’s kind of scary to think about.

Really though I don’t think people react any more strongly to celebrities than they do to more personal connections. It’s just that millions of people recognize the name of the person and everyone is kind of sharing in the grief publicly. It would be weird if a famous person died and it was just radio silence and nobody talked."

TrueCrimeDiscussion,ffcu7xt,t3_esvone,1579807357.0,I think usually the motive to kill their partner has to do with not wanting to give up control of their kids or split their assets through a divorce. Basically these people are full blown narcissists and are completely selfish.

TrueCrimeDiscussion,ff83rqw,t3_es5rsr,1579665211.0,It would make sense. A lot of killers insert themselves in the investigation. Going to places to hear people talk about their crime would be an ego boost for them and a way to relive it all.

TrueCrimeDiscussion,ff82hgm,t1_ff6pgjt,1579664254.0,"Yeah I kind of feel the same way. I feel like pretty much anyone that kills (other than self defense or similar extenuating circumstances) has probably gone through a psychotic break or experienced something that brought on a horrible mental illness. You can look to many serial killers and see that almost all of them had horrifically traumatic childhoods. A lot of killers have documented injuries to their frontal lobe. There are all kinds of reasons that someone could go down the path to be a killer that are not really their fault. I don’t have any more sympathy for her than I do any other killers that made the decision to do what they did.
