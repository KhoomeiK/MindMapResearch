Anxiety,fee8ia2,t1_fecfmnm,1579028584.0,Thank you for your kind words. It means a lot. Sometimes I feel like a failure for not being able to put in the same effort as others but i know i’m doing the best i can. Wishing you peace and happiness too!
depression,fe9ir0s,t1_fe9bjkj,1578937840.0,"This is the exact situation I’m in. I have a bachelors in a science and an arts degree, and that’s of no use in today’s world anymore. I would have to go back to grad school which just seems so difficult to do now. My mental health really suffered during undergrad and I’m finally in a slightly better place. For now I’m just working too but I know I need more school which is an awful realization. I know I wish I could be what my parents envisioned too.. it’s tough. Just know you’re not alone whatsoever"
depression,fe6y374,t1_fe6xro1,1578907650.0,"Thanks for replying to me. Yeah maybe I should be more honest but even when I do, sometimes it’s just seen as an excuse and I don’t want to use that as my crutch personally. It might be better though"
depression,fe6y0eh,t1_fe6xqci,1578907607.0,Thank you for taking the time to reply to my post. It really is terrifying that this is what our society is and everyone is just expected to work. I think that it would be better if each individual had the ability to enjoy what the world has to offer and travel and be happy. It’s unfortunate that we have to work the way we do. I appreciate it. I feel so lonely at times but it’s nice to know others feel like me. I feel burnt out sometimes and I just started working
AskReddit,fdwr9q0,t3_en9oep,1578761561.0,It’s helped me deal with my mental problems one step a time and helps time slow down. It also helps with my mind racing and gives me some relaxation.

Anxiety,fczgmwp,t1_fcy88a0,1578100819.0,Y’all should consider using their app to order online next time. It makes life a lot easier. You customize everything on the app and go in and just pick it up. I have anxiety and it’s the only way I can get subway

ABCDesis,fc9g2r5,t3_egprjl,1577552160.0,"Yes! My whole family likes to add some kettle cooked or regular potato ships with sambar rice, rasam, and even certain daals. Brings some crunch, saltiness and flavor to the fish!"
AskReddit,fc41kyg,t1_fc3b53m,1577404218.0,Thank you. I haven’t heard someone say that to me and I appreciate it. You made my day!

ABCDesis,fc1ue59,t3_eforg3,1577330021.0,That’s my mom to a T. She says she’s always correct no matter what and that everyone else around her is wrong. I’ve never seen her admit she’s wrong in her life.
AskReddit,fc17mos,t3_efmbhn,1577310569.0,"Other cultures seem so much more tight knit than America. People stay a lot more close to their neighbors, people around them and their families. That’s just usually different in most parts of America."

AsianParentStories,fbwnc8h,t1_fbwd7nz,1577154439.0,"I know I never understood that. they willingly chose to move us from asia realizing we would grow up in a different place, but didn’t expect our culture to be impacted? I find that ridiculous"
AsianParentStories,fbwbb6i,t3_eeoyok,1577145432.0,"I’m a south indian girl and my parents were extremely unhappy about me dating and falling in love with a white american. They said I won’t be able to maintain my culture and that we wouldn’t be a fit for one another. They also said they would never accept us together. But now three years later, they’ve started to come around and are more understanding of our relationship. I completely agree with your message- always stand up for yourself and what you believe in. Parents have some ideal expectation of what they want their kids to turn out like, but that doesn’t control what your destiny is. You do."
