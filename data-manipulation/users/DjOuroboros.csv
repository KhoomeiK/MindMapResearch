Clocked up 250 hrs on one save (I bought the game originally for the Beyond update for PSVR but ended up playing the crap out of it anyway) and then the update dropped and bugged by save (I wasn't even mad) so I started again from scratch with what was essentially a different game entirely. Currently 150 hrs in again, and I'm nearly caught up to where I was previously, if not slightly ahead. 

I love how there are many different ways to play the game. 
Like to design bases? they've got you covered.
Want to make a small fortune and take advantages with the stock markets? Yep.
Want to farm animals for meat and milk and get with the baking? Yarp.
Want to make music? Now you can.
