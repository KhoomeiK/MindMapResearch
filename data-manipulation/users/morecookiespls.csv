femalefashionadvice,ff79ngy,t1_ff6d99a,1579643980.0,i do this nearly every day! i just fill in my brows since they're really light and that's about it. i sometimes add concealer for my dark circles and blush/mascara but it doesn't look weird if i only do my brows that day
premed,ff6il4p,t3_erws22,1579627974.0,that's my exact expression when i get those emails
premed,ff559kp,t1_ff4cpry,1579580612.0,me too!! hurt just a lil
socialanxiety,ff3fh2d,t3_ere7vp,1579539985.0,"for me i read over my emails like 10 times and then read it out loud another 10 times before sending it out :""))"
socialanxiety,ff3f918,t1_ff2qrm7,1579539858.0,"same, both induce so much anxiety for me hahaha"
socialanxiety,ff3f7bb,t3_erc7p8,1579539831.0,thank you for this!
socialanxiety,ff2l5p4,t1_fexbbvz,1579511275.0,my struggle with friendships in a nutshell
femalefashionadvice,ff2j6vx,t3_eqlpdh,1579508532.0,"with my budget and part-time salary, my limits are:

$50 on shirts

$50 on pants

$40 on skirts

$60 on dresses

$200 on boots, $100 for other shoes (200 is pushing it but i will drop the money on it if the shoes have great reviews, are nice quality, and will last me for a while. in the past i typically bought $30 shoes and have suffered a lot because of it, so i've started to pay more for comfort)

$60 for jackets

$300 for coats (i don't normally get these but theoretically that's my limit)

$20 for accessories

nowadays i mostly thrift my clothes to stay within my budget while looking for a specific quality/brand, but sometimes i'm tempted by things way outside my budget that are beautiful (damn you, theory coats)"
femalefashionadvice,ff2inpr,t1_ff1qw8z,1579507824.0,"i love the tie belt detail on the skirt and the pockets on the side! and those wedges are super cute; if you feel more powerful in them, all the more reason to wear them : )"
femalefashionadvice,ff2ihg8,t1_fez0p7z,1579507600.0,here's a similar bodysuit i found on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HFN8J5P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)!
femalefashionadvice,ff2hitf,t1_ff2f6cf,1579506384.0,"yeah, i wasn't sure if it'd look right since the dress seems to be made of a thick material, but you could try the dress on with it and see if it works. if not, i'm sure you can layer up over it!

for coats, maybe a cape coat (paired with long gloves) or something with a relaxed fit?"
femalefashionadvice,ff2fyel,t1_ff1k4zu,1579504475.0,"like another commenter said, i think you can't be ""too old"" for something but there is an element of ""there's a time and place for everything"" to different outfits. 

i love all the styles you mentioned, especially goth/grunge and egirl/eboy, and it's something that i want to experiment with in my daily wear. granted, i probably can't go full eboy/egirl to work hahaha (my students and their parents wouldn't take me seriously) but i think it would be cool to incorporate parts of those things into my outfits. for instance, i'm interested in getting some black high-waisted trousers and a chain to attach to belt loops to emulate that preppy grunge look of an e-boy. or i think i could wear a band t-shirt with a chain necklace, although i'd probably change up the rest of the outfit to make it a little more ""acceptable"" as a tutor. that would be how i'd personally approach it!"
femalefashionadvice,ff2f3cx,t1_ff2bvlz,1579503481.0,"you could definitely bundle up in a coat, scarf, gloves, and thermal tights! and you could possibly layer a [thin black turtleneck under your dress](http://www1.pictures.itsrosy.com/mp/6MSk__UJaRrl.jpg) for extra warmth."
