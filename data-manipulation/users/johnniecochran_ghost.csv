Comcast,fdekkm3,t1_fdejhgu,1578340998.0,"I definitely understand since you're outside a city so it's more complex to provide the service out there due to infrastructure. I wish I could say the same but I live in Chicago,IL within the city where there is plenty of infrastructure and yet they still fuck up! 

On my call last week with a rep, she told me that the reason my service kept going down was due to a ""NODE"" in the area that was not working correctly and they were working to repair it. I told the rep ""well they either don't know what they're doing or they're just putting a band-aid fix because these outages have been happening frequently for the last 4 weeks. They should just replace the whole NODE if that's what's causing the issue"".

The rep started getting defensive saying it wasnt a band-aid fix and that they were trying to fix it permanently. 

I suggest calling them and asking for credit on your account since you're not getting the speed that you're paying for. I have at least 6 adjustments total coming on my bill due to 6 outages in this currently billing cycle. 

Definitely don't pay the full price if you're not getting the service as advertised."
Comcast,fdejan4,t1_fdeim5j,1578340225.0,"Damn, hopefully you figure out what's causing the issue. It could be their modem/router if you're renting one from them. Or you could be in my situation where the service is utter shit and has consistently gone down due to ""maintenance in your area"". I'm currently sitting here waiting for my service to come back up from its second ""maintenance outage"" of the day. I'm trying to find another ISP because this is beyond unacceptable (specially when I need a steady connection for work) but my options aren't looking good. Best of luck!"
Comcast,fdeigsi,t3_eku9mm,1578339723.0,"I went through a similar thing where my download speed is suppose to be 100mbps but my personal PC was giving me speeds of 50-70mbps. I have a work computer at home as well and when I ran the test on my work PC, it gave me above 100mbps. One thing I did was switch out the ethernet cable on my home PC. There are 2 types of ethernet cables, CAT 5 and CAT6. From what I read is that CAT 6 should be used for higher speeds. The cables look exactly the same but one of the differences is how much speed each cable can handle. Try switching your cable to a CAT 6 (they're about $4 at walmart for 3 feet but they also sell longer cabling if needed) to see if that fixes the issue. On my PC it started giving me speeds of 80-90mbps after the switch.

If you're already using a CAT 6 cable, then you may have to check with comcast support to find out what's causing the speed issue. 

Hope this helps!"
