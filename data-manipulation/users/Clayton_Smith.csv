Push up on the glass that covers the wheel from you (you have to put a bit of force into it). 4. Once the glass is up, you can now spin the wheel by hand and put it on the highest score. Side note: This doesn't work on all of them. If you can't push the glass up, it's cause someone did it before and now they screw the glass close (speaking from experience)."
