notliketheothergirls,ffgnd01,t3_etbsgt,1579910264.0,"I drink whiskey, but I mix it with ginger ale and like a few maraschino cherries in it if I can get it.

And I only like specific types of whiskey because other ones are too burny"

me_irl,ffeoinz,t3_et2814,1579857448.0,"My last name is a noun. It has at least 2 definitions, completely unrelated to each other. A few archaic definitions. It's super easy to spell and pronounce, unless you mishear it and change one of the consonants.

I get oddly excited when I'm reading a book and see my last name as a word (as opposed to a name). My friend's surname was Clay and he said he didn't get excited when he saw the word clay, but it's probably a lot more common to see than mine."

I wouldn't do it for other people's kids though. Also, I got a dog out of if so.."
ChoosingBeggars,ffckhk2,t3_eslz16,1579801383.0,"I used to babysit my nephew (he was 2/3. Did the same with my 2nd nephew, same age) for $50 a week, but I had no other way to make income, my sister supplied the food, they were broke and she is family. Plus I didn't have ridiculous rules about no phone, studying, etc."
niceguys,ffcjjck,t1_ffc1kmf,1579800810.0,My cat will swing by for one stroke down his back... then walk out of reach. Repeat about every 30 seconds for 5 min or so. Cats are weird.
polyamory,ffbzf9i,t3_esmu1g,1579787548.0,"It's pretty rad. Two other MCs were like ""wow, they seem so happy and fulfilled, maybe the youth do know something we don't!"" I'm paraphrasing, and the youth thing is a throw back to an earlier joke in the episode. These characters  (Poppy and Angie) and ~10 years older than Miggy and Angie was disparaging him as a millennial, despite the women being millenials as well.

Also, it's ""revealed"" that Miggy is bi/pan, but in a very no-big-deal way. He's also dating the other male in the relationship, and it's like ""you've seen me on dates with guys before, right? I just don't like to put labels on myself""

I love that it's two bi/pan guys and a girl, rather than two girls. I just feel like that's under represented."

WhitePeopleTwitter,ffa8o2b,t1_ffa8jc5,1579730037.0,"Really?! I'm in Linn County (Cedar Rapids, to be exact). That's nuts. Was it a preemptive cancelation where way more snow was expected?"
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff98cxr,t1_ff8u8hw,1579707199.0,"I live in Iowa... doesn't happen here. Haha. Although my district did cancel more often than the one I was technically supposed to go to (I was open enrolled), because mine was half rural. Gravel roads and open fields (no buildings to block wind, more drifting) don't do as well in winter weather."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff984qk,t3_esb6bd,1579707050.0,"My grandmother, mother, and a few other relatives worked for the school. This was back when the faculty and staff found out about cancellations and delays via phone tree. My grandma was one of the first people called after the decision was made for the district, so we always knew before it was even on TV. I always felt like I had secret knowledge."

He doesn't like.. want to talk about it haha (he doesn't care if I'm like ""ugh I have cramps."" but anything blood related is a no), but I don't think the majority of guys are like ""hey tell me about your period!"""
