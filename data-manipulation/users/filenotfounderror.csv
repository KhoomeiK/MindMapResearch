(although the article is wrong, 1.2x the average income in 2015 when this was published was 69,250, not 60,000).

Numbers aside, yes that is factually true.

BUT IT DOES NOT SAY that in order fund social programs in the US, it would be necessary for the US to adopt Denmarks tax structure.

**However, i think the article is structured in such a way that it WANTS you to draw that (erroneous) conclusion, while cleverly avoiding actually saying that, because they know its wrong.**

It draws all the parallels, **which are factually true** - but then lets the reader jump to a conclusion that isnt actually supported by what they wrote - and they do that by juxtaposing two ideas together and then kind of just letting the readers imagination run wild.

Im not trying to make the argument that social programs will not cause an increase in taxes (its a strong possibility they would, depending on implementation)  - but it would not look anything like this article is suggesting.

The article also conspicuously leaves out that, the demographics between Denmark and the US are wildly different, which obviously has a huge impact on tax implementation. 

Denmarks population is 5 million people. The US is 327 Million people!

You cannot just say. O Denmark has X, if the US wants X, it needs to copy the same model.

No, that is not reality.

We have a much much broader tax base AND a more productive tax base.

We would be copying the idea, but that does not mean it necessary to do a carbon copy of their implementation. 

Even on a very basic level, the US has 585 Billionaires representing about 2.7 Trillion dollars of taxable wealth.

Denmark has....10....representing about 40 Billion dollars

Jeff bezos alone is worth more than double of EVERY BILLIONAIRE IN DENMARK COMBINED.

Did i say ignore? because i dont remember saying that. I asked for a source.

Im implying we should verify things before killing people or supporting the killing of people, that seems pretty...... obvious - no?

I cant believe im saying this but, begrudgingly, agree with Tucker Carlson.

Carlson condemned ""chest-beaters"" who advocate for foreign interventions. He asked four questions that made clear his anti-war point of view: ""Is Iran really the greatest threat we face? And who's actually benefiting from this? And why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping into another quagmire from which there is no obvious exit? By the way, if we're still in Afghanistan, 19 years, sad years, later, what makes us think there's a quick way out of Iran?""
""Nobody is thinking like that right now,"" Carlson added. ""Instead, chest-beaters like Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska are making the usual war-like noises, the noises they always make.""

I will say this though. Price and returns are a function of risk. This is true of everything in life. finding a deal means you found something that you think has a mismatch between price and risk. (i.e. that the returns are higher than the risk justifies).

That being said, nothing is guaranteed. you can lose money in real estate. You can lose money in any money making venture. that is just life.

With that out of the way.

Real Estate has been the number 1 way for people to grow their wealth for a very long time. That isnt going to change in the near future, or in our lifetimes.

its is very difficult to impossible to raise your station in life if you are content to just work your 9-5 cube job and are unwilling to take any risks with your money. (and thats fine, as long as you are happy)."
