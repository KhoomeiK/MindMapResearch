I think it's something that really takes time to heal, time away from your mother to grow confidence and strength by yourself. You can choose to still see her or to stop seeing her, but if she is the main source of your stress it may be best to avoid seeing her often until you can safely tell her the way she makes you feel. I know telling her this will probably make her worry or maybe even upset, but if you aren't honest with her then she will never know or be aware of how what she's doing is affecting you. Try to find a couple friends, a club, hobby, or job to meet people who can give you the sense of having normal relationships with others and try to build your confidence that way.

I hope this helps. I have a similar relationship with my mother and my mood is very dependent on how she is feeling to the point that if she's mad at me then I feel bad about myself and question my abilities. Build a boundary for yourself and don't let your mom step over it. Let her know how you feel nicely and let her know you care about her, but that the way she is acting is also hurting you. Therapy also may be helpful in this situation if that is an option for you."

selfhelp,fcno9be,t3_ei4ghx,1577815264.0,"I'm almost 22. I'm saying these things from my own perspective, and I hope they may help in some way.

Enjoy and take advantage of your parents allowing you to stay with them, but make sure to let them know you appreciate it by either paying rent, helping around the house and/or showing them respect and appreciation. I'm not sure what your family relationships are like, but you really learn to understand your parents once you begin adulting on your own. 

Try to do well in school while you can. Take advantage of the free knowledge and structure being given to you now if you attend a public high school. Failing at something doesn't mean you shouldn't do something or stop pursuing something. And please remember that moving forward doesn't necessarily mean keeping up with other people, but focusing on your own progress and how you can change to make yourself better. 

That being said, I highly recommend filing for FAFSA and attending a community college before going to a university (if you plan on going to college and don't know what career you want yet). It has saved me a lot of money. Education is marketed as a product that will change your life, and it can if you have an end goal and a plan to get there. I know a few people who went straight to university after high school and dropped out because it was not for them at that time, or they failed and lost confidence. If you have a goal, create a list or map of the things you need to do to get there. It will help make the journey easier, and this concept works for many things such as doing projects. Learning how you learn best is important, and it is different for everyone.

I guess if you get anything from my comment, enjoy the last couple years of being a teen while you can and have good fun. Take care of your body and it will take care of you. Enjoy the people around you and try not to think about what others think of you as much. If you like being alone, walk/hike, read, write, or treat yourself to dinner at your favorite restaurants: find a hobby or job. Learn how to work smart and hard, but choose to work smart. Learn to be comfortable with yourself and do things that interest you. One thing I regret is spending so much time online and not being present enough to really appreciate the people around me while they were there. Make time to spend time with people you care about. 

Also, learning to use a calendar and to-do list is very useful - and the act of checking tasks off is very satisfying. I recommend google calendar because it is easy on the eyes and easy to use in my opinion.

These are things I would tell my 18 year old self, and I hope they may help you. Take it easy."

ask,f9kbr20,t3_e5gvxl,1575397111.0,"I just finished a pretty shitty research paper about if college is still worthwhile nowadays. I would say it depends on if you have a sincere plan. If you plan to go into a job field that is expected to grow and you have a detailed plan to become a knowledgeable applicant, and if you have a financial plan to take care of the costs of college, then it may be worth it. I think there are a lot of people pressured to go to college for the wrong reasons, like their parents pushing them, for partying, or because they find pride in the school’s name. Going to college because you are trying to learn skills for a particular job seems to have been thrown out the window from what I have seen. 
Many of my classmates in high school had no idea what they wanted to do, but chose what they thought was a “safe” major they believed they could do well in just because the act of going to college was seemingly more important than what they wanted to accomplish with the time and money being spent there. As a result, many of them only lasted one year at university before dropping out and deciding it just wasn’t for them. 
I am guilty of not planning myself. I’m the only child of a first generation immigrant from the Philippines and single mother with no post-secondary education, and she made hecking sure I knew it was imperative that I go to college regardless of what I went for. I had no idea what I wanted to do and I was afraid of going to school and wasting money on something I would not be able to use well. So I went to community college and got an associate degree in general studies, which is practically useless. I am now finishing a Bachelors of Arts in psychology, which is also practically useless unless I pursue a graduate degree. Also, society seems to be really demeaning toward people who study majors that are generally looked down upon like psychology, or if they don’t go to “prestigious/good/well known colleges” , in my experience at least. I went to a restaurant not too long ago and my waiter asked me where I go to college, and when I told him he seemed slightly disgusted with me. My school is known for being a party school but it is not a particularly bad school. You can still learn and become knowledgeable no matter which school you go to. It may not be the most socially acceptable major, but I’ve found my time spent pursuing it as fulfilling both career-wise and personally. 
I digress, but I have honestly considered learning to be a plumber after I graduate. I think people are pretty spoiled nowadays and they’re told they can follow their dreams and be just fine. I have learned a lot in college and I do not regret it only because I am lucky enough to have no debt or loans, but I feel like I could have found a better way to go about it. 
Sorry for the tangent and for not being the best writer. I hope someone can find my perspective interesting or helpful in thinking about if college is a good idea for them right now. 

To;dr I am graduating with a practically useless degree and am thinking about being a plumber. Society seems to fantasize about the benefits of having a college degree more than thinking of how they will be able to use it and how to apply the knowledge they learn in their future career. It’s best to be prepared and have a detailed plan of the route you want to take before you start your journey. Don’t go because you feel pressured or because someone else is telling you to."
