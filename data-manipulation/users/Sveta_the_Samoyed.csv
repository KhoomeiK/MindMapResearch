samoyeds,ffs8ycb,t3_eub8mn,1580176053.0,"It's pretty common for pups to not feel comfortable eating in a few environment. I would try some actual meat (unseasoned, cooked chicken or beef, even raw beef maybe), and see if that works. The only dogs I've ever seen refuse something like unseasoned chicken or beef broth were either very stressed or very sick. Try fresh broth with rice to get something in her system."
samoyeds,ffi43eo,t3_etrhtt,1579964507.0,"IQ Treat Ball for a feeding puzzle toy (large size). My girl LOVES it. We keep it in her crate with some food inside, and she'll beg to go inside to play with it. It makes meals more interesting and gives her some mental stimulation. 10/10.

She also really likes her Kong stuffed toys with knots inside, and the Kong stuffed piggy with a rattle inside. But you always have to be careful with stuffed toys--things can get dangerous if they swallow the stuffing or the squeaker. I had to cut the small, tearable pieces off of all of ours (like the ears), because she kept ripping them off and eating them."
samoyeds,ffi3bo8,t1_ffg3o70,1579963863.0,"/r/dogtraining and /r/puppy101 have good info, as does Youtube (I hear good things about Zak George). But classes definitely fill a void, especially when it comes to proper behavior around other dogs. That's something that Sams struggle with, as they're super friendly and dog motivated. If I hadn't trained my girl to have some restraint around dogs through classes, she'd be liable to drag me into traffic if she saw a dog across the street that she wanted to play with."
samoyeds,ffi34n4,t1_fffglxw,1579963697.0,"For the hair, my girl is intact, so she sheds twice a year. The coat blow lasts around a month for us. It is certainly a lot during that time (daily vacuuming), but the hair clings to itself and forms little cotton balls that clump in the corners of the house. So it doesn't coat the surfaces. It doesn't really stick to our clothes either (it balls up and floats away). My clothes doesn't look as bad as it does after visiting a house with a cat, for example. But right now, with her winter coat in, there's hardly any hair around the house. I just brush her regularly (a few times a week) to catch the hair before it sheds."
samoyeds,fffg0kv,t3_et48w2,1579883153.0,Can you take her to a different vet?
samoyeds,ffffxg5,t3_et91gc,1579883099.0,Are you prepared to walk the dog 3x/day and fork out hundreds for training classes? The hair is the least of the work my dog has been.

samoyeds,ff9durg,t3_esean7,1579710864.0,"Paging /u/orangetangerine! 

Personally, I'm not risking my girl off leash. She has a habit of chasing cars, and there's too much of a risk of her running into a dangerous situation. Plus, I could never forgive myself if she got lost chasing a squirrel. It's not that she wants to run away, she's just easily distracted."
samoyeds,ff80zw6,t1_ff3fa0m,1579663163.0,"I’ve always thought your dogs were so beautiful :)
I haven’t seen much of the European show line dogs, most of the Euro sams we follow on IG are from working lines in Sweden, Finland, and Norway. I was chatting with one owner on how much their dog looked like Sveta, and I guess there was also some Abakan in their line haha. Specifically from a sire that Darlu exported in ‘92 who fathered our 30 litters! That dog had a good life haha."
dogs,ff1r1re,t1_ff1jf0f,1579484296.0,"It's great that all your dogs have worked out well, but keep in mind, that won't be the case for everyone. If you bring home a dog into your family, and the dog gets anxiety every time your baby cries, it's not fair for the dog to be constantly on edge. Or if the dog was listed as being great with cats, and tries to kill your cat, is that fair? The dog will constantly be hunting prey it isn't allowed to have, and your cat will live in fear. If you can afford to hire a trainer to work out those issues, great. But if not, sometimes it's easier for the shelter to find a more suitable home."
samoyeds,ff14do5,t3_eqqqjg,1579475110.0,"It's funny, I was just having this discussion with the owner of a Swedish samoyed on IG--I had noticed that [my working-line girl](https://www.instagram.com/p/B21lbV7HUhY/) looks a heck of a lot more like the sled dogs in Northern Europe than any US Sams we've met. She has a much longer nose and a more wolf-like appearance than any dogs we know here, and so many random Swedish and Finnish Sams look like they could have been her littermates! Interestingly, the Northern European dogs I was following are also all working-line, with immediate family members on sled teams.

Our breeder definitely selects for a more old-school sled dog look, which I love. I know my girl likely won't ever be popular in the show ring, but I wouldn't change her face for the world. And personality wise, she's everything a Samoyed should be. So smart, incredibly loyal, and with a perfect temperament. We do therapy work with her, but if we ever get more than an inch of snow, we take her out to Skijor."
samoyeds,ff13391,t3_er2vh1,1579474731.0,"Mine grew a pound a week until she slowed down somewhere around 7 months. Mine topped out at 45, but she's very petite."
dogs,feoqcwc,t1_fenipn1,1579303906.0,"My dog does legitimate service tasks and is trained for public access as well (she is also a certified Therapy dog as a volunteer gig). British Airways wouldn’t let us fly because she wasn’t trained by Guide Dogs of America (She isn’t a guide dog), or ADI (which is 700 miles from us). I had to rebook my flight on an airline that actually could accommodate her."
dogs,feopqfg,t1_feni5f7,1579303636.0,"My dog does some service tasks, and I started introducing her to work in a public setting when she was young, specifically so she could get used to behaving properly in public while wearing her specialized harness. She does packing work, so for her, it was mostly about behaving in stores while carrying her packing harness and carrying some light weight. But she wasn’t working anywhere close to full time, and has plenty of time to be a dog."
samoyeds,feo6cbx,t3_ep7wx7,1579295741.0,"Many people on here have had very bad experiences with them, unfortunately, from hip issues to severe glaucoma. Plus, the breeder posted a completely insane rant here when someone else posted their bad experiences. I'm sorry you're dealing with this :(

And for the record, the user talking about raw meat doesn't really have anything to support that. Raw diets can be great for some dogs, but they're certainly not a miracle cure for urinary issues. If anything, I usually hear them talked about in the context of coat quality. 

Your best bet is to go to a vet. I only have ever dealt with incontinence from medications (my girl had to be on steroids for a while when she got bitten by a tick), and it's really rough to deal with. We had to wake her up to potty so she wouldn't pee on herself. We bought a gallon of Nature's Miracle and that helped keep the house fresh."
samoyeds,fec3he1,t3_eoc919,1578966105.0,"We're very happy with the Ruffwear Front Range. 

I'd caution against the easy walk or even using a front clip--we thought our front clip was a miracle cure for our girl's pulling, but it affected her gait and she started walking lopsided to compensate. Easy Walks can affect gait since they don't have full range of motion also."
samoyeds,fec3ani,t3_eodjay,1578966026.0,"Are you sure he has good enough recall not to chase a squirrel forever on an off-leash trail? I don't think I'll ever be able to trust my girl off-leash, personally. It's not that she wants to run away, it's that she will forget everything else in the world if she sees wild game. 

At 4-months old, I would think 30-40 mins would be the upper limit. It also depends on the conditions--if it's cold, they will have more stamina than if it's hot."
askswitzerland,fec2zgq,t1_febuecq,1578965906.0,Gotcha--the airline didn't say anything at all except a health certificate and proof of rabies/distemper. But I guess the health certificate includes the APHIS sig as well.
askswitzerland,febrcho,t1_fdzfina,1578961844.0,"Is it the airline that checks or an office at the airport that does the checks? 

Looks like my closest office is 3.5h away. Ugh. Thanks so much for the heads up!"
askswitzerland,fdyazn1,t1_fdxllh8,1578777884.0,"Oh shit, I had no idea. I'll definitely look into that!

Looks like there's a few offices within an hour of me--does it have to be a specific type of USDA office?"
samoyeds,fdxkmxn,t3_emt37o,1578769804.0,"When my girl was 4 months old, she required a $700 vet bill from a tick bite, so there was that. 

We use 1 bag of purina Pro Plan ($42) every month and a half or so. 

Her monthly flea and tick and heart worm medicines might be around $50 or so. 

Equipment is an up-front cost of maybe $500 for the collars, leashes, toys, crates, harnesses, etc. 

Cost of a Sam that is from a reputable breeder is around $3k. If you skimp on that, you'll likely spend a lot more in vet expenses from health issues. 

Vet bills are the big one. Mine has been a bit more incident-prone than my previous dogs were. Twisting her leg while climbing on furniture = $150. Having an allergic reaction to a shampoo has been around $500 (covered by the shampoo company, thankfully). Kennel cough (despite being vaccinated!) was another $500. Tick bite and anaplasma infection, $700 (covered by tick medicine company, thankfully). She swallows a part of a toy and starts barfing, another $250 for x-rays. And so on.


Her classes have been $250/6 week class. She's done a lot of those. 4 obedience classes, 3 agility classes, therapy certification, cgc, etc. Totally worth it though."
samoyeds,fdxk1fy,t3_emskwy,1578769518.0,"We had great experiences with our rufflwear front range harness. Initially we used the front clip to teach her loose leash walking, but it had a negative effect on her gait (she started walking lopsided to compensate for one shoulder being pulled back), so we use the back clip and have had no issues since. It's durable and adjustable on every strap."
askswitzerland,fdxjlkn,t1_fdlvvi1,1578769362.0,"Thanks! Our vet is thankfully USDA certified, so they should be able to take care of the paperwork in a reasonable amount of time!"
samoyeds,fdlpe1h,t1_fdlk5l5,1578529324.0,"In her case, she also had a fever of 105 and was napping a lot more than usual. She was still eating and drinking as normal, and was still active and playful when awake. But instead of being 1h, her naps were like 3h. Eyes were slightly red, but I didn’t think anything of it until her third or fourth day of long naps. So I took her temp, and it was off to the vet from there. Eye swelling came the next day, after she started antibiotics. It went away with the steroids. Her blood work showed mild anemia as well. The whole story is early in my post history if you want to read it. 

That said, I know of other Sams with Anaplasma who never showed any symptoms at all. It has a variety of presentations. So if your vet didn’t do blood work for tick illnesses, I highly recommend the panel just as a precaution to see if there’s anything there. 

I never thought in a million years that she would get a tick illness. We only walked her in the neighborhood on sidewalks and our own lawn/backyard. And to top it off, she was on a flea and tick preventive. So even when the odds are 1/1000, it can still happen. We switched her to a different preventive as soon as she was old enough."

I'm surprised that scratches managed to get deep. Maybe it's a softwood like bamboo? 

We honestly just made some very DIY stair-runners using the long runners from Costco, and putting them end to end. We stapled them down and trimmed the edges so it looks somewhat continuous. It's not the most elegant or good looking solution, but it works for now. And I'm glad we didn't break the bank when she decided she wanted to pull the carpet loops off of one of the stairs..."

homeowners,fdkpdya,t1_fdk5jxi,1578508381.0,"I mean, we take our dog to friends' houses, but only because our dog is probably more popular than we are. Our friends are upset when we leave her at home. And, she's well-behaved, potty trained, and trained for public access."
samoyeds,fdkm4cw,t3_elemd7,1578506398.0,"When my girl had eye issues, it was because of a tick infection (in our case, anaplasma). Have you had a tick panel run at the vet? Her third lids were out, her eyes swelled shut, and she had conjunctivitis. Antibiotics and steroids cleared it up, but it was a brutal month for us."
samoyeds,fdklwlz,t3_elmbea,1578506268.0,Sounds like my girl. We had her trained and certified as a therapy dog because she is so gentle with kids and loves the attention.
samoyeds,fdklsib,t3_elt6i1,1578506198.0,"Honestly, we just put down a lot of rugs. And discourage her from running inside. We had to put stair runners on because she was sometimes slipping and tumbling down the stairs. We also make an effort to shave her paw pads (our vet does it for free) and keep her nails trimmed. 

You can also buy dog booties with grips for places that are extra slippery, like your parent's house. We personally never had issues with her damaging our hardwood, but her nails get filed down naturally from walking on cement."
samoyeds,fdh0xb4,t3_eiikgk,1578412974.0,"We never had an issue with that, but we use White Pine brand to protect her fur. She did get fur staining from the metal tags though. 

My girl is an escape artist, so if she weren't in a collar, there would be a risk for her to potentially get out with no tags. 

However, wearing collars inside can also be dangerous if your dog would get caught and snag on something. We never had an issue with it, but some people have had bad experiences. Some people buy breakaway collars for this reason."

My girl developed a very gentle mouth with this method. She'll sometimes nibble on my fingers when I let her, but very gently. And she stops when I tell her to. She has never drawn blood through nipping or trying to bite."

That said, we generally use a crate for car travel since she prefers it to her seatbelt harness, and it lends itself to activities like Agility where she has to go in and out of the car crate a lot. In order to fit the crate in the back, we have to fold down two seats. We are going to get a car where her crate can fit entirely in the trunk so that we can have full use of the back seats."
