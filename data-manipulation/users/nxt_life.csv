Columbine,ffhovhz,t3_etfhhr,1579946010.0,"They’re two completely different shootings with completely different shooters. I think Eric and Dylan were much more methodical and personal. Cruz just wanted to kill as many as he could, Eric and Dylan wanted so much more than that.

I also think Eric and Dylan better understood the gravity of what they were doing. When you watch his arrest video, it’s like Cruz realizes how much people are going to hate him for the first time, so he starts spewing shit about demons and voices. When you watch interviews with him, he seems to have some level of regret and definitely a lot of hatred towards himself.

Part of me thinks all Cruz really wanted was attention, and for people to take him seriously. Eric and Dylan genuinely wanted to create chaos and destruction. Cruz did that, but I think it was more for attention than to make some sort of statement."

Benzodiazepines are not a better alternative, I’m amazed that she thinks that. It sounds like she bases that off her own biases agains weed and not any actual facts. How open minded is she?
