BlackPeopleTwitter,feslw6i,t1_fesfu35,1579366608.0,"For sure, but have you ever had a high stress job? There aren’t deadlines, work risks, or uncomfortable environments. 

It’s not a walk in the park, but to quote bill burr, have you ever been a red headed roofer in the summer? It’s not manual labor or something where people die on the job, and they don’t treat you like an immigrant cleaning snobby peoples’s homes. And peak hours aren’t that common. A lot of Starbucks work is just hanging around, which is low stress as non-degree requiring jobs can get. Most jobs really suck, especially for non-office jobs."
todayilearned,feskrd6,t1_fes5bdf,1579366244.0,"I said desirable, not affordable. It costs a shit ton cause people with more money are willing to keep paying the rising costs. There’s a housing crisis caused by liberals, but the rest of those things are common everywhere. And don’t pretend like high taxes are a bad thing, that’s how you address all the other issues, and Californians get a lot of great public services for that money, such as the homeless shelters that take care of the bussed in homeless from other states."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fesc9uo,t1_fes0xkw,1579363794.0,"Depends on your definition of great job, but this is definitely true. That being said, working at Starbucks isn’t that bad either. It’s not zoology, but it’s a stable, low stress job."

It’s not defensiveness, it’s just that the criticism doesn’t feel like criticism, but more you not enjoying the genre/point of the show. The discomfort over the plot is something you were supposed to feel, not a hack cliche."
YouOnLifetime,fepmxlg,t1_fepm6mx,1579324788.0,"I guess, but the whole show is about the main character being a serial murderer of women he loves and stalks. So at that point, the only other option was to have her die in the original crime or end the show."

This sub is necessary to check the hhh bullshit, but knowing how many of you fucks are white guys that liked Eminem at a young age just makes these comments seem self-flagellating."
Hiphopcirclejerk,fenazcu,t1_fen1j5e,1579280811.0,"You’re not wrong, but at least on a first listen this seems way better than eminem has been lately. His fans suck but he’s not a bad rapper and he’s objectively produced good albums at some points in his life.

You can’t diagnose her as a sociopath, but the word has cultural connotations people understand outside of the diagnosis. It’s not “feels”, it’s using language like a normal human.

Many others will leave if those breakdowns don’t become less frequent or are rare, or it will really put pressure on the rest of the relationship to “make up” for the hard times. 

I’ve dated my fair share of women, not many are as serious about being into “vulnerable” women as they say, and often mean that they really do still expect 80% of the time you’re totally stoic. 

That being said, there are certainly women like you, I’ve found one myself and I consider myself eternally grateful because she helped me grow faster than any therapist. 

So good on you for being supportive, but I don’t think it’s fair to say people like you represent the norm, even if you only include women who say they like vulnerable men"

6 day PPL, NSuns, others?

Why not just do what you were doing before, you may ask?

I lost so much strength (currently 2.5 plate squat, 3 plate deadlift, sub 2 bench), which I mainly built on NSUNS. Would that be a good place to go back to, or is there a more preferred semi-linear progression 5-6 day a week body building program for these specific goals?

I don't want to look like an r /fitness SL5x5 (no offense I'm just not about massive size unless it's aesthetics oriented, all respect to some of the muscle beasts this sub has/has created).

I take my aesthetics and diet goals seriously, but just am trying to nail down the right program.

As I said though, nsuns might be the answer at least till i get back into needing a PHAT/PHUL or PPL style intermediate program again"
