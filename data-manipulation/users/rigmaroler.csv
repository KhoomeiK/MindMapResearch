>In order to make something illegal, it has to be defined

This is not really true. You can make something illegal by exclusion (i.e. defining it and saying it is explicitly not allowed), as you are thinking, but a lack of inclusion also makes it illegal (defining what is allowed and saying all else is not). The law, as it stands today, says that only a dwelling with 1 unit may sit on a lot in ~75% of the land in Seattle. The unit must not cover more than 35% of the lot, it must sit on at least 5000 sq ft. of land, as well as a whole slew of other rules that make the housing types I pasted earlier illegal. If you want to read more, [you can look here](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/SingleFamilyZoningSummary.pdf) for the SFH zones, and [here are the zones where townhouses/rowhouses are allowed](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/MultifamilyZoningSummary.pdf)."

SeattleWA,ff863ej,t1_ff7m7su,1579667028.0,">unreasonable costs, fees, or delays

No fees, legal proceedings, or extra costs, but a 6-plex must adhere to the same rules as a SFH, so it could only cover 35% of the lot and have a maximum size of 2500 sq ft. and maximum FAR of 0.5. That would satisfy this requirement and make sure each unit has to be <500 sq ft. on average, which is way too small for many people's needs.

That paragraph is not good. We need to eliminate minimum lot sizes and drastically increase maximum lot coverages. At the very least, do like 35% (as we have today) + 5% for each additional unit on the lot for a max of 60% (for a 6-plex) and maybe +.25 FAR per unit, for a max of 1.75 (just over 50% lot coverage for a 3-story building). That would be better than the existing maximum lot coverage and FAR rules."

3rd Ave has been a big bus corridor for a long time, and it went bus only morning to night 7 days a week just a year and a half ago (instead of peak hours only). That change was not very controversial from what I can remember.

It's also very congested currently due to a small public right of way given the foot and bus traffic it gets, and is only going to get worse. The DTA is coming up with proposals to make 3rd Ave better, such as turning 4th Ave into a bus only street as well and having 3rd go one way with 4th going another.
