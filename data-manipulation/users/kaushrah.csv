So even if Canada does an extremely good job - if India (where I come from) doesn’t do enough or maybe erodes all the good work - then it’s not making much of a difference. Hence, the 85% dependency is an avg for the world. And rich countries can invest in good solutions but it’s not easy for many other countries. 

In an ideal world - we would not have global warming or children sleeping hungry. Unfortunately we don’t live in one"

What I meant though was - taking certain habits - which ppl have regardless of gender and associate it with Men. For example - manspreading. Its basically ppl who take too much space - so that others are not able to sit properly or sometimes have no seat. This is not in anyway men-exclusive. Other genders also take up unnecessary space which they shouldn't.

But when the herd moves on - the pride would hunt whatever they get their paws on. 

If we don't find a solution and with the growing issues related to fossil fuels make them less cost effective - humans would move to the other solutions. Like how we use steel and concrete for construction instead of wood."
