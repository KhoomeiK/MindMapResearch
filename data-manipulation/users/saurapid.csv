It's possible your puppy's behavior isn't normal (sadly a real possibility since unfortunately doodle breeders aren't particularly trustworthy, and schnauzers can be intense dogs), but you should certainly be able to find a trainer who can help you, instead of making you feel bad/ignoring you."

For your class, how did the trainers make you feel awful? It's not uncommon for puppies to be uncertain in new environments, though your puppy's reaction sounds a bit on the extreme side for 9 weeks old. Either way, the trainers should have supported you and helped manage the situation (having your dog set up farther away behind a barrier, etc.), not made you feel bad."

Dogtraining,ffuz4dj,t3_evd3nc,1580252121.0,"There are other types of treat toys out there your dog might prefer. Snuffle mats might be a good choice to help him slow down and provide some enrichment, without requiring as much drive/skill as a kong wobbler."
dogs,ffuu09h,t1_ffutean,1580249313.0,"I would be if I actually wanted him as a ratter, but mostly I just want him for reassurance that I am/am not hallucinating mice. Basically I needed a dog I was super confident would flip if there was a mouse in my apartment, so that if I started to panic, I could look at him chilling out and go ""nope, no mice, this is just being crazy."" He has not actually found or killed any indoor mice for me, thankfully!

And I think in general caring about a terrier for ratting is now old-school enough to be a bit uncommon and weird. ;)"
