Friends daughter was a good kid, did ok in school, was in police explorers and cheer, and had a bit of vision on her future (at about 12-13 years old). And then she got her boobies and discovered sex (with a 20+ year old). Dropped out of school and dropped her boyfriend a little later when she found him cheating on her. Hooked up with another 20+ year old and got preggers. Had the kid, broke up/made up several times with baby daddy, and then got preggers again in final break-up sex. She is now 19, 1 kid with one on the way, no diploma or GED, no job, no boyfriend or husband, and living at home.

Since I an not family and my friend is only the step-dad, neither of our opinions really mattered. We both saw Bad Things coming a mile away and said so but were ignored and overruled.

This month is month 64 since starting YNAB4. When I started I had $13k in CC debt, a $6k car note, and a $15k HELOC all on an annual income of under $20k. This month (several weeks ago) my CC balance hit $0 for the first time in over a decade. The car is long paid off and the HELOC is at $9k. Additionally I have had to replace my AC system and my water softener system and also pay for a root-canal. It hasn't been easy to do, but it is possible if you are serious and willing to make the sacrifices needed to accomplish it. I think that the big key (aside from admitting that you needed to change in the first place) is to make sure every item is tracked on the budget somehow and that every inflow/outflow is accounted for as soon as possible. It's all too easy to say that I'll update later/tomorrow/next week and for that to become a bad habit.
