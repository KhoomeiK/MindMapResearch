movies,ff8jznq,t3_es2im1,1579682081.0,"I can understand the idea of the public hating the parent(s) of a school shooter, but interestingly in this story, Kevin also killed Eva’s husband and daughter, so I feel like in real life maybe there would be more sympathy for her? Or maybe it’s a reactionary thing, since she is the only parent still alive and was responsible for bringing Kevin up, then he does such an awful thing. Perhaps she’s just an easy target."
movies,ff8jofn,t3_es4jac,1579681641.0,"I saw it recently too. Yes, I agree Corbet is young and has been able to impressively transition into fully fledged film director. Good for him. 
I liked this film, it’s was quite a mixed bag. I would have liked to have seen the years between Celeste starting out and her in her 30s as a successful, famous singer. 
Personally, I didn’t think much of Raffey though, she just didn’t seem to be that impressive, though she did better as the daughter of Celeste. I did like Jude Law and thought Natalie Portman was fantastic. 
It really made me think about what fame does to people, especially singers. It seemed believable in terms of portraying artists who started young and that’s all they ever knew, who hit rock bottom, then made a comeback. I kept thinking about someone like Britney Spears for example."
TrueCrime,ff8jam5,t3_erybbb,1579681097.0,"Agreed there has been less content recently, though the content is brilliant. I believe the last one was about prison violence, which was really good. It probably does take some time to research and put content together, especially when really, JCS has so much to work with and put together. Maybe with the new year he’s been busy, don’t forget people probably have full time jobs as well whilst YouTubing, or studies, or personal/family matters. Hopefully there’ll be more and more often, but yes I believe the Patreon channel was partly due to YouTube removing certain videos, but at $1 a month, can’t complain."

TrueCrime,fej9z40,t1_feivxqt,1579163439.0,"Whenever there is a family annihilation I always think the perpetrator was probably dealing with financial issues, or criminal charges, or anything bad that was just mounting up. To kill your entire family suggests you don’t want them to suffer the consequences of your actions, but also you are trying to give yourself reason to get up the courage to kill yourself. I’m not saying this is always the case, but I know if I killed my loved ones I couldn’t live with myself. I wonder if that was his intention, but he still couldn’t go through with it?"
