But yes, it can be really bad. I often get lower back pain, cramps in my thighs and stabbing pains in my stomach. It can be quite debilitating. It can also be rather easy, where you don't experience too much pain or cramps. Generally it's just not that fun dealing with pain, mood swings, having to prepare yourself whenever you're going somewhere (etc etc) once every month. It takes some work. But yeah, as I said, it's different for everyone. Some might have it easy and others don't. Everyone's different."
AskReddit,ffk33pl,t3_etttdp,1580014321.0,"The lost girls of Paris by Pam Jenoff. Such an amazing, vividly detailed and gripping book that's inspired by true events from World War II. The story is centered around three strong and very brave women and a secret network of secret female agents. It's such a good book and I highly recommend it!

Also, Fierce Kingdom by Gin Phillips. This book was so good and although I read it about 1,5 years ago, I still think about it from time to time. The book is about Joan and her four year old son Lincoln who, on their way home from daycare, decides to stop at playground in a local zoo before they head home. Before the zoo closes for the day, something happens that makes Joan grab her son and run for cover in order to survive. The whole book is so thrilling and nerve wracking and I also highly recommend this one!"
