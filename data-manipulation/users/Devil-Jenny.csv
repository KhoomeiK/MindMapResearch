About 4 years ago we had an employee give out 244 of these little packets, he was fired on the spot.  We never allow more than 243 at a time, it is a limit set by corporate.  

So yeah, you can be certain that this employee went the full mile for you.  Enjoy, and we look forward to seeing you at your next Taco Bell visit! :)"

AskReddit,fdp459p,t1_fdot2q1,1578619563.0,I was a Clinton voter. I qualify. See my other comment.
AskReddit,fdp408e,t3_emhkiu,1578619469.0,"I voted for Clinton.    I despised Trump and I participated in almost 100 rallies against him leading up to his presidency. I was sure that he was a modern day Hitler.

Well, with nearly 4 years of having him as president turned me into a Trump supporter.  I make no apologies about it. Things have only gotten better with him in office, you can't deny that.

Sure, he runs his mouth off whatever.  But in the bottom line, he gets things done.

On top of that, all the Democrats running are a bunch of cowards (except for maybe Bernie but he lives in la la land).  I won't be voting for any of them.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
