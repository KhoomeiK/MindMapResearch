AskReddit,ffehvg7,t3_et0asi,1579848636.0,"Was about 13 riding my bike with a few friends and while we were waiting at a corner a car pulled up with a woman looked to be in her 40s over 300 pounds and she leaned over and said ""hey boys want to have some fun? We can go someplace and I'll make you feel really good"". Needless to say we all looked at each other and sheepishly said no thank you and rode off. Really creeped us out."

science,ff82efd,t3_es1s95,1579664193.0,"As long as killing the planet is profitable we will never achieve such a drastic change. Unfortunately a lot of the rich would rather suck the planet dry then lose money. Mostly because a lot of the super rich are in the older demographic and dont give a shit what happens after they die as long as they squeeze as much money out of the world as they can while they are alive. Granted some like gates and such do help but it's not close to enough of the big picture. Hopefully when the newer generations become the leaders of the world we will see that change, but I hope its not to late by then."
