statistics,fgtnvev,t1_fgt2ino,1581107037.0,"I’m not an expert here and get confused myself.  I do want to express how disappointing and almost negligent the field has been in not addressing this clearly.  The problem is that the the field feels entitled to recommend a course of action and feels entitled to push its tools into other fields as valid tools for decisions and understanding.  Fine.

But with entitlement comes the accountability for explaining how those decisions are arrived at in a way clearly comprehensible to voters and management.  “You have to trust me because I’m an expert” —not acceptable.  

Yet I deal with many statistician/DS types who are frustrated because they are not supported or believed or taken seriously.  I am regularly left with having to explain that the core competency of that that VP role is soft skills and not math, and that the core responsibility of that VP role is to protect the organizations scarce resources from the various idiots and self serving fast talkers looking to fund a program.  In short: inability to explain is a defect of the speaker not the listener.

We would ALL be much better off more decision makers had a route to understanding the statistical recommendation."

Next day we got up and rode the subways for most of the day.  Not disappointed.  He learned properly filthy talk in Arabic, Spanish, and English.  He learned all about the proper jewelry to wear with your wife beater.  He learned which shoes are best to beat your baby daddy with.  How to whack off into a trash can with maximum visibility.  After a long and enlightening discussion with a fine citizen of the Bronx, he and I both got an understanding of the difference between the pimp slap and a bitch slap, and the various nuances and etiquette of when to use each.
