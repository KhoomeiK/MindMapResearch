As long as you keep it in the safety zone( that is temperature hot enough to kill bacteria). Then you are safe In fact that's how [master sauces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_stock) are made

Parenting,ffno65u,t3_eub9wy,1580068434.0,Here's a quick tip go to him when he fusses and talk to him first. Get his attention the moment he stops making a whining sound then pick him up. You do not want to pick him up while he's actively whining because that reinforces the behavior. Look for a window or break in the fussing and act then that will reinforce his calm behavior. You can use toys or other items to distract him in order to get  him to calm so that you can pick him up.

science,ffk59hp,t1_ffk4cc0,1580016298.0,Oh I understand that It's just the areas that's showing migration in California either do not have a high population or won't have much effect from rising sea levels so they won't have much displacement of people.    For example north of San Francisco there is barely anyone living along the coast. And much of the coast is on high cliffs. There will not be a lot of migration from those locations due to sea level rise. My problem with this graphic is that it's a poor representation of actual data.

science,ffjvjus,t1_ffjozrn,1580008128.0,I agree sensationalism ruins credibility. Everything written on climate change needs to be accurate and above board. One poorly written article can be bandied about the internet for years used as a cudgel to suppress real science.
science,ffjuo05,t1_ffjnzaw,1580007431.0,Yeah definitely the Bay area would be affected. Especially considering most of the lower level Bay area is landfill. They were filling in areas of shoreline during the gold Rush. San Francisco is high risk. I was just off put by the way the map seems to treat Eureka or Cambria as being affected the same as San Francisco. The NOAA maps paint a more accurate picture.

Someone else suggested this map and it is really good use the slider on the side to see the coastline at higher sea levels."
science,ffjuak5,t1_ffjlwa2,1580007132.0,Thanks. This is far more accurate. This is exactly what was throwing me off. There are many areas that will see very little change in sea level rise because of their topography. on top of that areas with drastic topography seem to have less population. It's exactly why the map and the article seemed a little off.

science,ffjeuqp,t1_ffjbqeq,1579996773.0,I understand that but it doesn't look accurate. It looks grossly oversimplified.
science,ffjek7q,t1_ffjbh9x,1579996606.0,Very little of California is actually low lying coastal area. Pretty much the only people it would hurt are a very small population of very wealthy landowners and insurance companies. In the low-lying areas it might take one or two blocks of beachfront property before you hit the bluffs. No freeways or main arteries would even be close to being submerged.
science,ffje8l1,t1_ffjbelp,1579996411.0,I like the way you think
