It is the only version I read, and without having read anything else to compare it to I do not know what would be inaccurate with this version. Do you mean the translations are unreliable or just the purports?

videos,ff53isr,t1_ff5169w,1579579233.0,"I believe the person above is extrapolating from the story in the gospel of John wherein Simon uses a sword he's carrying to cut off Malchus's ear. So if Simon has a sword, it's not unreasonable to think other disciplines are carrying weapons. It would be uncommon for someone to casually carry a weapon, let alone a sword, while in a city, especially Jerusalem. So if Simon has a sword, then maybe other disciplines had swords or smaller weapons. I don't recall any other explicit mention of other disciplines carrying a weapon.

John's gospel is the most dubious of the gospels, but the story is echoed elsewhere. And I agree, it seems strange the Roman soldiers would not have stopped someone from entering the city with a weapon. But scholars have often noted that when the gospels describe an unflattering event, it might be more likely to be true. For example, Jesus throwing the money lenders' tables casts Jesus as violent and unable to control his emotions. It seems to go against the portrait of him throughout much of the rest of the gospels as having love for all. So too then would it probably not look good for the early Christians to have a story of one the most important disciplines cutting someone, especially when Jesus ends up telling his disciplines not to resist his captors implying that Simon was wrong to have been violent. EDIT2: Went back to see the passage, and it's even worse for Simon. This is where Jesus says after telling Simon to put the sword away that ""For all who draw the sword will die by the sword"". So Simon's definitely in the wrong according to Jesus. Very unflattering for him.

EDIT: I read your comment too quickly, and just realized you're asking for a source besides the garden scene. However, your recollection of the story is off. The gospel says the sword is Simon's, not the gaurd's sword. "" Then Simon Peter, *who had a sword,* drew it..."" And the next line is Jesus saying "" Put *your* sword away "" Those are from John. In Matthew, although it just says ""some companion"", it says this person drew ""his"" sword."

Nevertheless, the only thing I previously knew about Robert F. Kennedy was that he was a senior lawyer for the NRDC for a while and was a moderately successful environmental lawyer. He was particularly active in water rights and clean water laws. So overall, I had a somewhat positive view of him. 

But I just found out the he bankrolls anti-vax meetings and propaganda. I felt like sharing the TIL not so much to point out the bad acts that he does but more so to juxtapose that he ended up as such a committed anti-vax after having done decades of actually important and helpful work. I find it surprising. I'm assuming he actually believes in the anti-vax nonesense, but I haven't' looked into him thoroughly. If he does not, and he's supporting it for some ulterior motive, that would actually be less surprising to me.

books,fevnrjg,t3_eqlwwq,1579399469.0,"ITT a lot of misunderstandings about the book and of Buddhism generally. Hesse's work is not a promotion of Buddhism nor an accurate description of it. He copies much of the Buddha's story of his youth and life, and even his name, but the main character Siddhartha is not a representation of Buddhism. He is a personification of the ideals of romanticism, specifically German romanticism. Romanticism focuses on the aesthetic and was in many ways a reaction to the developments in science and technology of its era. German romanticism also focused heavily on humor, irony, and wit in its presentation of its ideas. Both also have a longing for some imagined simpler time in the past where certain values, which vary by author or artist, where prioritized over more modern focuses on distracting vices. 

There's cursory explanations of some Buddhist ideas involved, but overall Siddhartha is always seeking his own path which he believes can only be experienced and lived not taught. Buddhism, while a well-developed religion with thousands of years of analysis, refinement, criticism, rituals, and other draperies, does not deny that certain knowledge is obtained only through one's own actions and life, and the Buddha himself constantly urged followers to question everything included him before accepting any truth, but it does not focus on an absolute individualism and self-reliance that the book conveys. 

Siddhartha is enjoyable, and I do not mean to take away anything of its enjoyment from anyone. I just would like to help clarify for people who seem to have misunderstood the book. I do not know actually whether Hesse believed he understood Buddhism, as it was common then as it is even today for many authors to write about Buddhism as if they understand it when really they've imagined a version of it that coincides with that they already believe. But nevertheless, Siddhartha is not a book about or promotion Buddhism."

I think it's because the mummies are relatively young compared to what we typically think of as mummies - Egyptian mummies (nevermind the presence of mummies throughout the world, since most people will have only seen an Egyptian one, if any, in a museum). But I think they remain scientifically and historically valid. They still reveal a look into a sector of this community's history. Having said all that, I was bothered by the end of the museum where two mummies are left unprotected and available for photo ops. One was sitting on a bench, the other standing in a coffin. But they're not behind glass or roped off, and you're encouraged to get close and take your photo with them. I saw many people touching them directly, and it was clear they were more damaged than other mummies on exhibit.

todayilearned,feainny,t3_eo4ele,1578949274.0,"This title is misleading by saying the Satan is mandated to test the loyalty of God's followers. The Jewish bible only mentions the word Satan a few times, and only in two books is he regarded as a specific figure. In the Torah during the story of Balaam, God sends a Satan to be an adversary. He is not testing the loyalty of God's followers but instead is acting to obstruct the seer.

I think you're confusing ""the Satan"" by his appearance in the book of Job. There he is testing Job, but he is not ""mandated"" to do so but instead proposed the idea himself. God did not come up with the idea but rather allowed the Satan to carry out his experiment.

Also the title says the Satan is focused on followers ""in the nation of Judah"". Judah was a specific kingdom, the southern half of what was once the united territory under King David (the north being the Kingdom of Israel). As I mentioned, the figure of a specific Satan is only mentioned in two stories, and mostly people think of the book of Job. But the book of Job does not take place in Judah. Instead, it takes place in Edom. The story does not even specify that Job was from Judah or Israel, and many rabbinic sources state he is a gentile."
todayilearned,feacik5,t1_fe8m94p,1578947000.0,"I agree that Milton's work really spurs the idea into the Christian imagination, but it's not a novel idea itself. Islam's Iblis is very similar to the devil and he lives in hell. He's placed there as a punishment similar to the early Christian conception and to Dante's vision, and to be honest he's not well described in the Quran. But later Islamic tradition, prior to Milton, sometimes viewed him more so as a ""ruler"".  

This makes sense since Islam is partially inspired by Zoroastrianism. In that religion, there is an evil god comparable to the devil named Ahriman, and he does clearly ""rule"" hell. Quite a bit of the final judgment and what happens in the afterlife in Islam comes from that religion.

It's worth noting that in Greek and Roman mythology, Hades/Pluto was ""ruling"" the underworld, and this imagine likely helped shape later Christianity too."
todayilearned,fea9ffj,t1_fe8dbip,1578945928.0,"I too would like to see what texts you're referring to. ""Hebrew literature"" is a broad term, so I don't know what you might be thinking of. But nothing I'm aware of in the Hebrew Bible clearly states the serpent is the Satan. You referenced the book of Wisdom which is not part of the Jewish bible canon. Further, it's vague one sentence does not clearly state that the Satan is the serpent from the garden. ""But by the envy of the devil, death entered the world and they who are in his possession experience it."" Death entering the world generally is not the same as Adam and Eve becoming mortal and susceptible to death. Once they leave the garden, there appears to be the rest of the world already in existence with people and animals in it, and ""death"" would have already been in existence. So this devil in that passage apparently brought about death prior to the garden scene, and the sentence doesn't refer to the serpent."
worldnews,fe867i8,t1_fe6jbsl,1578922988.0,"Thanks for following up. Maybe we are using the word bulk differently but when you said ""the bulk"" I understood that to mean the majority. Based on number of books or based on word count, Paul did not write the majority of the Christian bible. Based on word count, Luke, assuming he is the author of both his gospel and Acts, actually contributed more. 

Or maybe you think I meant to dispute he wrote the bulk of the entire Jewish and Christian bible combined. If so I did not. I meant only the Christian bible. I wrote Christian bible the first time but later only referred to it as the bible. That may have been confusing.

worldnews,fe6hw53,t1_fe5pg14,1578891408.0,"While it's not necessary for someone to understand the joke you're helping to explain, there's a few items you mentioned I'd like to correct since non-Christians are reading your comment to learn. Saul didn't ""change his name"" to Paul. He used both names interchangeably, Saul being his Jewish name and Paul his Roman name. Dual names was common then, and Jews often have dual names even today. Jesus refers to him as Saul in the Damascus road story and even after his conversion. In Acts, Luke says "" ""Saul, who also is called Paul"" indicating the names are both valid.

Paul didn't write the bulk, as in majority, of the Christian bible. Even if we assumed all the letters claimed to be by him were authentic, he would have written less than half of the books.  And most scholars believe he did not actually author several of the letters traditionally attributed to him. However, he certainly was the most prolific contributor to the Christian bible. In terms of word count, Paul was also not responsible for the majority of the Christian bible. Each letter is not that long, and assuming the same author penned the gospel of Luke and Acts, then Luke contributed the most words to the Christian bible. 

Also, for anyone learning about Paul for the first time, it should be noted all of these descriptions are coming from biblical sources and are not supported outside the bible. Paul most likely existed, but there's no non-biblical source for his claims of his past zeal and Christian persecution, his encounter with Jesus, that he was a Roman citizen, or that he was jailed or executed by the Romans."

todayilearned,fdrlieh,t1_fdqugmv,1578686302.0,"Manichaeism was indeed a form of Christianity. Not maybe by today's standards, but back when there was no one defined form of Christianity and there were many forms competing which could vary strikingly. I agree it was influenced heavily by Zoroastrianism, and I think it was also a form of Zoroastrianism too. Therefore, it's a mix of both, with a bit of new ideology thrown in by Mani. I never claimed the Gnostics influenced the Zoroastrians.

As for the number of gods, yes it was a dualism with two competing gods, but they were not ""equal"". The texts indicated that the good, spiritual God, although not infinitely powerful or omnipotent, was seen as the more powerful and preferred force. After all, devotion is to the good God. And the evil god is always on the offense, trying to trap the Light of the good god. When you read about the religion, it seems the good God is not even fully fighting, and yet the battle is stalemated. For example, the good relies on humankind as its proxy for battling the evil, rather than fighting directly, even though humans were said to be created by the evil god in the first place. The good God largely stays out of the material world, and therefore I said that it seems the spirit realm of the good God is a higher realm of existence. The evil god cannot seem to go there or attack the good God in this realm, and can only fight by drawing the good God into battle within the material realm. That to me implies they are not equal, and that this good God seems to be of greater significance. 

I agree that in the literal definition of monotheism, this religion is not monotheistic. The evil god coexisted with the good god for all eternity - their are two eternal gods. But I said it is ""essentially monotheistic"" because there seems to be one superior god which is not simply stronger but in some ways very different. Because the good God has its own realm of light and seems to be much stronger, it seems that it's somehow something different than the evil god and therefore the religion shows a unique, singular force which is fighting some lesser opponent. In the same way you can look at how many Christians view their religion with God versus satan. Granted that in that case one is God and one is its angel creation, their relationship looks similar to how the good and evil gods exist in Manichaeism. 

Further, I do not say it is unequivocally monotheistic because the religion stresses that the good God did not create evil, but rather evil somehow independently arose and that darkness always coexisted with light. This was actually something that the early church would point at to prove the religion was not monotheistic. 

As for your Mara analogy, I disagree. First, it depends what type of Buddhism you are talking about. Some forms see Mara very closely related to a modern Satan, although this was not its original interpretation. But second, and more importantly, Mara is not a comparable figure because there are many stated gods in Buddhism but their rule and function are not equatable to a god as described in Manichaeism or the Abrahamic fathers or Zoroastrianism. Those gods are not the creator uncreated or something supreme requiring absolute praise and from which we depend on for salvation or an afterlife or anything else. The Buddha despite referencing Mara or gods consistently refused to make any viewpoint on a supreme God or on divine origination or anything else. Rather, these gods are merely beings on a different plane of existence preferable to humankind but still subject to Dharma. A true ""God"" would not be subject to any such laws but instead would be the creator of the laws. Buddhism has not explicit source for the Dharma.

Mara is also described as a completely psychological creation, part of the illusion which duka creates. Mara does not just create the illusion of the material world but he himself is also part of that illusion. Many buddhists have believed that the entire concept of a duality good versus evil is illusion, that there is no fixed or independent evil."
todayilearned,fdrew2x,t1_fdr9956,1578683611.0,"It depends on what you're looking for. Do you want to know what the religion was or about the history of the religion generally or how it compares with and influenced/was influenced by other religions? There can be of course lots of overlap between these categories.

If you want to know the religion, I always prefer reading original sources first before delving into commentaries and historians. I think it's best to try to approach the texts before you've received the bias of someone's interpretation. Granted, you may not understand the texts or all of their nuances by doing this, so you might need a commentary or reference guide to assist, but that's where I start. I don't recall where to find them online, but you can order the books on Amazon. I think the gnosis library website has them here but I haven't verified these. http://gnosis.org/library/manis.htm. However, basically nothing that Mani supposedly wrote himself survived, but there are fragments and some other later works available. 

If you want broader overviews of the religion and its influence, you can read or listen to works by Bart Ehrman. He's a great reference on the early Christian sects and texts. If you want a quick synopsis video in about an hour, you could watch one on Youtube by Bruce Gore, but keep in mind he does minimal research and is heavily biased against ""heresies"". If you want pure adoration for the religion you could read or listen to some things by Jason Jorjani, but you should note he is a white nationalist, misrepresents some history, and outright makes up some facts, as his goal is always to make anything Iranian or Iranian-influenced seem as important as possible. Saying that, he also can be factual and helps bring forth some information which is not always easily accessible in English. 

Barnstone and Meyers have a book called The Story of the Dead of Mani which gives you more history and the religion's influence, and the same authors also either translated or edited a compilation of Manichaen texts which is a handy reference.

You can also read St. Augustine's Confessions which has some information about Manichaeism as presented by a once-believer.

I left a few comments throughout the thread already which some might find useful. To add a bit more facts which might pique your interest further, Manichaeism was both its own religion and a form of Christianity and was for a time a serious contender for which variation of what would become orthodox. It was also a form of Zoroastrianism. It incorporated heavily from eastern philosophies and thus had a stronger root there. It spread far into western Europe and north Africa, but also throughout central Asia and all the way to southern China. It was immensely impactful, and was persecuted almost everywhere it spread. Nevertheless, it lasted for well over a thousand years."
todayilearned,fdqrdjp,t1_fdqotsf,1578673241.0,"Not all of what you said is accurate. Yes, St. Augustine was a Manichean for many years, and it influenced some of his believes. But it did not lead him to believe that infants are born with sin and require baptism. His writings specifically state that the practice occurred long before him. Scholars don't know exactly where the ritual began but believe it's likely a manifestation from the Jewish purification washes. I've read most of St. Augustine's work, and can understand many of his arguments, but his logic for this custom is absurd. What he states in one of his books is that BECAUSE infants are baptized, they must have sin which requires purification. He accepts without knowing why that baptism is right and proper, so works backwards and applies sin upon birth as a logical prerequisite. It's quite disappointing to read actually, since he devotes real effort to some of his other doctrines, but this one he kind of just forces in the reasoning to account for the ritual.

As for ""sex is dirty"" and ""only for procreation"", these are Jewish believes, and were already commonly accepted among early Christians as a carry over into the new religion. You do not need to rely on Manichaeism to account for them. 

I don't know where you're getting your information about holy orders and priesthood. Manichaeism did have a clerical hierarchy, but so did most forms of Christianity by St. Augustine's time. Recall that St. Augustine was mentored by Ambrose who held title, was ordained a priest, and later appointed as a bishop. Therefore, these systems already were in place long before St. Augustine.

St. Augustine's MAnichaen background did influence him, that's for sure. So too did neoplatonism which he also studied. But not in the examples you cited."
todayilearned,fdqo3an,t1_fdqb8lx,1578671196.0,"This isn't classical paganism. This was the most successful of the Gnostic forms of Christianity which almost became the main form of Christianity but eventually lost out to what became the orthodox views of the Catholic Church. It borrows heavily from older beliefs but identified itself as a Christian religion as revealed by the prophet Mani who apparently thought himself an apostle. St. Augustine was a devout Manichaeist for his early life and described Mani to be a follower of Christ. It is also essentially monotheistic, as the evil god is of a lower realm of existence then the one true God, and therefore not really comparable."
todayilearned,fdqnm87,t1_fdqfs26,1578670898.0,"You spotted this well enough but you've got the chain of events off.

I wouldn't say ""our modern belief systems"" though, since this is not present in Judaism, Buddhism, Daoism, and many other religions, but it's a majority view.

However, these ideas did not ""survive"" in the sense that they were adopted by the other religions from Manichaeism or they somehow otherwise were so ingrained that when the religion ceases the ideas remained. Rather, both Manichaeism and Christianity got these ideas from common sources before them. And later Islam acquired these ideas from the two of them. Also worth noting that this religion comes after the first Christians, and was a sect of Christianity. By the 3rd century Christianity's emphasis on Good versus Evil was not fully developed or as prominent as it is today, but this was one popular interpretation.

By the way, there are other beliefs of the religion that you can still see today. For example, that individuals possess a bit of essence or ""spark"" from the true God, and that certain individuals who accept the faith did so because they were chosen."
Documentaries,fdo7i38,t1_fdo5klx,1578600232.0,"As my post below states, I am indeed Jewish. But nonetheless you do not need to be of any faith to study it or to know it. 

Some aspects of Judaism has changed over time. That's clear just from the Hebrew bible itself. There are changes and even clear contradictions stated within the texts. I am not denying that Judaism is a living religion. But that doesn't really change what I wrote. When I said ""literal"" that was not the best way to describe it, but there are plenty of Jews who take the Hebrew bible literally, word for word, despite your kosher example. Those Jews would simply say you should not bathe the calf AND you should also not mix meat and dairy which derived from it. That does not refuse a literal interpretation but instead builds upon it.

Nevertheless, my point was not that every Jew was a literalist, I listed ""literalist"" among several types of people. I also listed orthodox, conservatives, and traditionalists too. Further, I did not say that everything was taken to be literal, but ""most of it."" My point was if someone is going to claim to speak about all of Judaism, they need to define their terms. Because the person above, as revealed by their response below, really was only speaking on behalf of a certain group of Jews, themself included. I was offering instead a more fair way to talk about ""Jewish ideology"" by looking at it from the texts up to the present, during most of which time most of the Jews were of the more conservative or orthodox side, and were more prone to a strict reading of the scriptures. 

To your last sentence, I do not think have have studied the Hebrew bible much. A literal reading of the texts would not lead to animal sacrifice or polygamy. King David specified that animal sacrifices could only take place in the temple (i.e. THE temple, not within a temple, the one that stood in Jerusalem, was twice built and destroyed). Since the temple no longer stands, animal sacrifices cannot be practices. It follows then that while many Jews simply would find the practice barbaric and outdated, the practice died out because it could not possibly be done. If a new temple was built, many orthodox Jews would likely revive the practice. Regarding polygamy, I don't follow your reasoning. While ancient Israelites often were polygamists, and even some of the Jewish kings, polygamy is expressly condemned repeatedly. Why would a literal reading of the Hebrew bible led someone to do what it condemns?"
Documentaries,fdnhkwz,t1_fdnhfd5,1578585964.0,"You should learn more about the diversity of religion. love thy neighbor is not the central tenant of Judaism. It is also not a necessary or basic component of many world religions.

Edit: I don't mind the downvotes, but the response above did not provide that the behavior in this video is ""against Jewish ideology"" as they claimed. They instead inaccurately stated that the ""basic"" element of all religions is to love your neighbor. Love for one's Jewish neighbor is spoken of often in the Hebrew bible, and there are a few passages which state that respect and kindness, but not necessarily ""love"", should be shown to non-Jewish neighbors or strangers too. But this is hardly a ""basic"" doctrine of Judaism. 

What instead the person above is doing is simply projecting their own view of Judaism onto all Jews. According to their post history, they were raised as a reform Jew. Reform Judaism is not representative of all ""Jewish ideology"" as they spoke of. In fact, as the name suggest, it is a much more modern interpretation of Judaism. As the person above also stated, the have limited religious education, so they're likely basing their view of Judaism solely on their upbringing, the teaching of their rabbi, and whatever experiences they've had with other Jews. This is not a representative sample.

I too am Jewish, but I have also studied it heavily. I too am saddened by this video, and personally disagree with the behavior shown within it. But I would not characterize the behavior in the video as ""against Jewish ideology"". It can be defended quite strongly by the religion, and while the issue of illegal settlements is a contentious topic in Israel, it is not one-sided. Many Jews, and even PM Netanyahu, encourage the settlements and think it is a right of Jews to hold all of the land based on the Hebrew bible."
Documentaries,fdngvgp,t1_fdnbffv,1578585534.0,"I'd like to hear how you think this goes against the ""ideology"", or what you define as ""Jewish ideology"". If you are referring to the theology, as in the religion as stated in the Hebrew bible, I'd appreciate your response to incorporate some reference to the Hebrew bible and Judaism the religion as has been practices for the majority of its existence - i.e., with acknowledgement that for most of history Judaism has been a conservative and traditional religion closely aligned with the Hebrew bible, often taking most of it to be literal. Therefore, please keep in mind the Hebrew bible's explicit approval and even commandment for the taking of land in Israel and even genocide. Would that not be a factor of whatever you describe as Jewish ideology? 

Yes, Judaism, as any religion, has many variations. But you speak in generalizations, so presumably you mean to capture the average Jewish beliefs which must include the conservative, orthodox, traditionalist, literalist, etc, who constitute a great percent of the Jewish population, particularly in Israel."

history,fdhomhz,t3_elahly,1578427056.0,"The main thing I'd like to convey is that while Zoroastrianism is an Iranian religion, it cannot be fairly said that it was the state religion of Iran prior to Islam. It was the official state religion of the Sassanian empire, but it was not exactly the religion of Iran prior to then. What I mean by that is that is was never the only religion of the empires, and generally all religions were always tolerated. It was also likely not the religion of the majority of people most of the time, although even non-strictly Zoroastrianism would probably have been at least familiar with the religion and sometimes even influenced by it. For example, Christianity and Manichaeism were heavily inspired by Zoroastrianism.

It's better to think of the territory and people of Iran historically as successive Iranian empires, rather than a single ""Persia"". Persian"" comes from the area Persis which was inhabited by an Iranian group of people who later became significantly influential, and was the name used by the Greeks to collectively refer to many of the Iranian people even if not technically accurate to do so. The empires' boundaries and peoples often overlapped but were different, ranging in size and populations, and varying from which group of people was in charge.

For example, the Achaemenid empire comes from Media, which is in the northwest of Iran including Iranian Azerbaijan. It's believed by most scholars that the Medes were polytheists who worshiped many gods, and may primarily have recognized Mithra as chief God. Although we often think of Cyrus and his descendants as Zoroastrian, we don't really have any contemporary evidence of this, and we can't even be positive Zoroastrian, at least as we would readily recognize it, even existed yet. However, we have a somewhat helpful source from Xenophon, who wrote about 200 years later that Cyrus swore an oath of allegiance to Mithra.

Next was the Parthian empire which came from eastern Iran. This empire too are generally said to be Zoroastrian, but there's little archaeological evidence to confirm this. There are some contemporary sources stating such though, but so too do we still see Mithraism being strongly practiced in parts of Iran. There was also a large Buddhist influence which came from the Kushan empire in the south. There was also a notable Jewish presence and a small but growing Christian presence near the end of the empire. Also Manichaeism was founded in the third century in this empire which spread quickly (and also spread far into Europe and China).

After the Parthians, the territory was governed by Greek rulers of the Seleucid Empire, and many religions were practiced and mixed.

Later you have the Sassanids who did stress Zoroastrianism as the state religion, but they never banned other religions and many people continued to practice other faiths. Nevertheless, it is during that empire that the religion was most clearly defined and shaped. Many religious scholars believe that the religion that became defined at this time is not quite the same as the older Zoroastrianism, particularly in its rituals and sacrifices, but many of the religious tenets may be the same.

I'm skipping a whole lot though, partially because I did not intent to write nearly this much and am just now noticing how long this is getting, and partially because I simply don't know enough to speak with confidence about it great detail. But I'll say that as others have pointed out, the religion did not die out. Some argue that the version of Zoroastrian practiced by the Parsis is not quite the same as its earliest forms, but I think it's rather hard for us to truly know what the original version of the religion was. The Avestas were likely after the general core beliefs had already been adopted, and old sources and scarce and likely have undergone revisions.

The religion is at some risk of dying out at least among Parsis because of their strict prohibition on interfaith marriages and prohibition on conversions generally. So you have a small group of people who have few choices for spouses, and some of the practitioners leave the faith and community because of various reasons like to integrate into their surrounding societies or to pursue other interests or beliefs which cannot be really maintained within the community.

Zoroastrianism is also seeing a bit of a revival, albeit not that big, within Iran and elsewhere, particularly with young people. But these Zoroastrians are self-proclaimed and not recognized by Parsis. This is not to say the Parsi community is to decide who is and is not Zoroastrianism, but I'm just noting that the ""revival"" is essentially a separate sect apart from the Parsi community.

Edit: Removed a few beginning sentences which were distracting and not helpful. I meant only to convey my surprise at the quality of the answers to this question because this sub generally provides great content, and here it was somewhat lacking. Most posts incorrectly assert that Islam wiped out the religion or provide anecdotes about having once met a practicing Zoroastrian. I am not disputing Islam's affect on the religion generally, but such an answer fails to provide the context of the Zoroastrian religion in the first place, and overlooks its variations and its continued existence."
