Conservative,ffh5hyt,t1_ffgwxmn,1579923667.0,"I agree.  But government started this whole thing.  Student loans are guaranteed by the government to a percentage which made the banks not care about the underwriting of the loan.  Want to take basket weaving for 50,000, sure taxpayers are on the hook for it.  Banks used to underwrite their own loans and assess the credit worthiness and ability to repay.  They really don't care anymore.  Guess who created that system?  The government.  They cannot fix it because that fix will bankrupt us further.  Government sucks at business!"

trashy,fff4npf,t3_et58v4,1579875597.0,"Former banker here, never tell the bank that someone has died.  It is just so much easier to be joint account holders.  Close the account and reopen with a different title or move to another financial.  Once we hear death, the initial instinct is to shut off all access and check with legal.  Don't give them that chance.  I used to tell that to all my customers."

fatpeoplestories,ffey9n3,t1_ffebcso,1579870205.0,"I have fired a lot of people and it is never easy.  I worked with new employees during their trial period so it was part of my job.  My motivation was never about the person who could not do the job, it was the co-workers who would be stuck with them if I wimped out.  It sucks, it is not fun, but it really is merciful to the 90% of everyone else who works hard.  Sometimes you just have to let people go."
thesopranos,ffexrel,t1_ffdvz59,1579869710.0,He doesn't see them as real people like him.  They exist only to please him.  That's it.  He is a dangerous person.  Just disgusting he got away with this for so long and so many people knew he was more than just a creep.

I'm going to wait another week or two and ditch it.  Real equality is recognizing each person's uniqueness, it is not male or female and it is definitely not telling people they will always be viewed as less because of their gender.  It's bs."

The 55 and over rule is pretty common in retirement communities, even those without HOA's.  You agree to it when you purchase or sign a lease.  In this situation it does suck, but I get why they are enforcing it.  Nobody wants kids living there. That's why they choose a retirement community.  If they allow it, then you have to allow it for everyone.  It is sad for this poor kid."

DuggarsSnark,fehuihs,t3_ep3mkp,1579124128.0,Choosing their own spouse.  I mean that in the actual sense and in the sense they they do not even know who they are and are now married and expected to raise little people.

She lives separately from her husband as he is retired, she works all day, she competes hundreds of appearances each year and is in her 90's.  She does seem to be a great representative of the UK.  Who cares about the spare and his wife?  Live wherever and do whatever, just don't take money from the UK taxpayers and give back all of your titles.  Go away!"

Libertarian,fei2umu,t1_fehrouf,1579129060.0,"Well at least in New York it is one of the very few rules you can enforce in who lives where.  The 55 and over rule is pretty common in retirement communities, even those without HOA's.  You agree to it when you purchase or sign a lease.  In this situation it does suck, but I get why they are enforcing it.  Nobody wants kids living there. That's why they choose a retirement community.  If they allow it, then you have to allow it for everyone.  It is sad for this poor kid."

DuggarsSnark,fehuihs,t3_ep3mkp,1579124128.0,Choosing their own spouse.  I mean that in the actual sense and in the sense they they do not even know who they are and are now married and expected to raise little people.  They have no sense of self beyond what they were told they liked and did not like.  It is really sad.

Sil killed Adrianna on Tony's orders and somehow he is better than Janice.  It really is amazing."

She lives separately from her husband as he is retired, she works all day, she competes hundreds of appearances each year and is in her 90's.  She does seem to be a great representative of the UK.  Who cares about the spare and his wife?  Live wherever and do whatever, just don't take money from the UK taxpayers and give back all of your titles.  Go away!"
