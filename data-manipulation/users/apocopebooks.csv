* Lower utilities by 50%
* Lower homeowners insurance ($350 instead of $1200)
* Lower property taxes by 50%
* More time to deal with finances, since no more yard care or shoveling and only half the time spent on indoor cleaning, going from 2400sf to 1200sf.

* Sold our home before the real estate market dropped
