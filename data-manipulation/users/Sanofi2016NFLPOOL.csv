 Talk to my family doctor.  Needed a tetanus shot and he had to order rabies vaccine.  Rabies vaccination not as bad a people think but not fun either.  One shot on right arm and two steroid boosters in each butt cheek.  No lying on back or sitting for like a week.  Subsequent rabies vaccinations every month for three months.  No steroid boosters needed after first rabies vaccination.

Now i will never pet an animal that i cannot see again.  Cat, dog or whatever animal."

manga,fetbbr1,t3_eqeele,1579373594.0,These differences exemplify the difficulty translating languages.   Getting idioms/sayings correct and not translating literally word for word.  Getting context and word usage is not an easy job.  You even need to know the current words and idioms to get the translations to have real meaning.  Props to those who try!  Even more props to those that put the extra effort to get context and meanings through to the readers.
