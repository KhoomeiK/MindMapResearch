Okay, so, there are a few things that stood out to me as far as areas of the site that can be improved. One, some of the product images on the homepage are a little grainy, like the ones linking to the shoes and the women's clothing. The featured products underneath the promo code aren't properly centered on the page, the images are cut off on the sides (at least that's what it's looking like on my browser (Yandex)). 

Two, on your about page, I feel like your copy could use a little revamping. Even if you don't think the clothing is the ""most fashionable,"" I wouldn't share that, myself. You gotta believe in your product, you know? Also, there are some grammatical errors and some spelling errors. (\*cough cough\* I'm a content writer so if you want some (100% free) suggestions for your copy, PM me!)

Your page is also a little laggy, and slow site speeds really drive away consumers!

Other than that, I think the site looks pretty good. I wish you luck with everything! :)"
