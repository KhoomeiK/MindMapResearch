nevadapolitics,ffyqgz6,t3_evpem9,1580352649.0,"I have a friend who is a major gun enthusiast. Card carrying NRA member n'at. He went to a gun convention here and even he said it's insane how anyone can basically just walk up and buy a gun at the conventions. Gun control doesn't mean taking away all guns, it means being moderately fucking smart about them."

vegaslocals,ffj8u47,t3_etmet0,1579993182.0,Cuginos on Maryland Parkway across the UNLV is pretty phenomenal for an Italian deli. Not quite what you're looking for though. But definitely check it out sometime.
worldnews,ffj8eef,t1_ffik851,1579992906.0,"Awesome post. I don't know the right terms here, but do we know yet how long the virus can live outside of a host? I guess I'm asking how long it is contagious? How long are people contagious?"

dogs,ffibqkw,t3_etpi0s,1579970082.0,"If you can't afford the medical care, the responsible thing to do is to wait until you can and then start looking. Even healthy dogs can eat something they shouldn't, break a bone, etc. Not to mention needing spayed and neutered. Dogs are expensive. Puppies are *very* expensive. You owe it to yourself and to whatever pup you bring home to be able to give them proper medical care if they need it."
