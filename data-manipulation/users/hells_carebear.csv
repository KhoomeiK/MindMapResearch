CatsAreAssholes,ffeg6x3,t3_et0zmu,1579846764.0,My cat loves my lax tea. I am constantly trying to prevent her from drinking it. Apparently it's better than the water in her water bowl.
CatsAreAssholes,ffee25g,t3_ei34wd,1579844572.0,"My cat always sleeps on the side of me or my legs and idk how I always wake up before I almost crush her, she won't move if I'm literally right about to crush her and somehow she is okay with half of her body under mine. Silly cat will only move if I accidentally kick her."
cats,ffdg5ce,t1_ffd1x23,1579820174.0,I honestly expected her to be picky because my cat didn't like wet cat food like most other cats but she certainly likes my food. I wonder why your cat likes popcorn. May be the butter?
cats,ffctqwq,t1_ffctibt,1579807082.0,It really is funny to see what they are into. Sometimes it surprises me how eager she is to have sour cream and other foods.
cats,ffcku7v,t1_ffck839,1579801598.0,We honestly can't help but cave to our pets.
cats,ffck7vq,t1_ffcj67y,1579801220.0,My cat will just continue to jump and sit on my lap and crawl all over me till I cave. They know how to get to us.

WeightLossAdvice,ff9lmk3,t1_ff8ieim,1579715585.0,I am eating eggs every morning with one tortilla and some chile. Sometimes I'll have something small with it like yesterday half of a blueberry muffin and then I try fasting the rest of the day. I'm going to try and walk 30 minutes a day starting today.
RedPillWomen,ff87mla,t1_feprgvc,1579668313.0,I enjoy watching her!
RedPillWomen,ff5aeqn,t3_ermb62,1579585151.0,"I use African black soap, and shea butter regularly. 

I also take Biotin supplements you can get at Costco. Drink apple cider vinegar pills.
 
Shave my face with a straight edge razor. It's always best to pluck your own eyebrows just don't be tweezer crazy.

 I use charcoal toothpaste and I just started whitening strips. 
 
Biotin shampoo and conditioner is good (you can find cheap ones) I recently was gifted some shampoo/conditioner for dry hair and a tiny bottle to keep the color in my highlights. 

Something I just started was using fermented rice water for my face and hair. 
Then the face masks I put on when I feel like it or toner. 

Shaving regularly is always amazing and having lotion on after but shaving is so time consuming.

I need to be more consistent with my whitening lotion (for knees, elbows, armpits, and inner thngs)"

AskReddit,fewblum,t3_eqies2,1579408008.0,This was a couple years back. I was playing fallout 3 and I remember going into the kitchen to get a glass of water. As I'm serving myself my mom asks me why I'm not drinking what I had served myself. She picked up the small plastic cup (reusable plastic) with a straw and a few chia seeds in it. I told her I didn't serve myself that. I ONLY drink out of glass cups and I never get a straw at home. But apparently she SAW me make it and place it on the kitchen table and so did my brother. I felt crazy because I was so sure I had been playing fallout the whole time and just went out to get water.
funny,fepghkp,t1_fepfdak,1579319899.0,I did miss it till you said something. The only people who wouldn't miss it are pervs. I'm not a pervy guy so I probably don't understand what it means to constantly stare at vaginas.

RedPillWomen,feott5n,t3_eq2pcy,1579305386.0,"I believe that looks matter to a certain extent. But to each their own. Looks matter in the sense of first impressions and the beginning stages of getting to know someone. You can meet someone who is gorgeous and then later see they have the worst personality where as someone who isn't as attractive has the best personality.

 Looks invite people in and you may feel you lack in that. Just work harder on getting to know people and letting them get to know you. When a person falls in love they typically see no flaws and the person they are in love with is perfect.

 My boyfriend met me when I was thinner and prettier. I've gained some weight yet he still finds me beautiful. I've always found my boyfriend attractive. Even more so now that I'm massively in love with him. Find a person who won't look at just your looks. Show them what an amazing personality you have. There are plenty of guys who are with girls that are easily  a a ten and there are plenty of girls with guys that are easily a ten."
RedPillWomen,fenba3d,t1_fem54uq,1579280996.0,"Sometimes I don't see it as helpful but I'm so intent on saying what I am feeling. He also takes my explanations as ""jabs"". So sometimes I don't even know what to say."

RedPillWomen,fenb2sk,t1_fekz8en,1579280870.0,I definitely think it'd be easier to fulfill a role than telling myself I HAVE to do this. Fulfilling a role is so much better sounding.

RedPillWomen,fekvub1,t3_eplmlq,1579208655.0,"Alot of older women on this sub will shame you for one dating online, and two for it being long distance. I myself am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend who I met on reddit as well. We both had feelings for each other very quickly and now we have been together for 8 months. I love my boyfriend very much and we were quick to become a thing. I'll admit that it wasn't a smart move because it is a bit overwhelming and we didn't know how to navigate our relationship. I am (18) and he is (17) but if you aren't 16-18 I wouldn't recommend having a boyfriend and just keep it as friends. Take it slow and learn about each other more. You can't learn about a person in just one week. Don't submit to this person that you hardly know because they might not be the one. I'm not saying that he is not the one but I'm also not saying that he is. You can only learn that from time and slowing things down. Don't rush things is all I have to say."

RedPillWomen,fe5bcvd,t3_entx3v,1578867301.0,"You don't have to be a dainty delicate women who needs saving all the time. Just slowly open up to him. No matter how masculine you are you still should be allowed to speak of your feelings including that you feel smothered. Talking kindly and nicely goes for anyone not just red pill women. Red pill is just a tool box. Take whatever tools from it you want and apply it to your life. You do the duties of a woman already on top of going to school. You are not only getting an education but you also clean, cook, and are a helpful amazing person. People might tell you you need to be this all feminine beauty that needs to wear dresses. You don't have to if you're not comfortable. I LOVE wearing dresses and being all pretty and dolled up. That's my preference but it may not be yours or someone else's and that's okay. If you really want to try and be more feminine try doing some light makeup to enhance your natural beauty. Maybe wear a dress on a date. Doesn't have to be pink and cutesy."

Even if those before have treated you like less remember that you aren't. It can be so helpful to tell yourself when you see yourself in the mirror ""I am important"" or whatever you need to hear. Because sometimes you won't hear it from others, anyways the most important persons opinion and thoughts on yourself is yours."
MomForAMinute,fdrovwj,t3_emq22u,1578687572.0,People who were in abusive relationships typically end up in another or several abusive relationships because they don't know what a healthy one looks like. Learn now. Go find yourself a good person.

You can be a housewife, feel that being a stay at home mom is important, and being a submissive woman is good. But never ever get with an abusive pos. They will take advantage of your submissiveness.

presacanario,fcnrczk,t1_fcnfi5w,1577816980.0,We do take her for walks. She loves other dogs and is friendly but I don't think she knows her own strength. So I should always keep her on a leash even in dog parks? We have discussed taking her to some nearby dog parks for socialization.
presacanario,fcnr554,t1_fcncy1e,1577816869.0,I've been doing some research on presas and so has my family. I'm just a little too scared to muster up the courage to tell her no or to pick her up or move her food. Sometimes she doesn't care other times she'll growl and make a move like she will bite you. She loves to sleep on couches and if we move her when she doesn't want to move she growls. I hope training will do us some good.
