sports,fewr86i,t1_fewnvmv,1579418293.0,"""Dirty Boxing"" technique used perfectly.  I've never seen it used in MMA this well.  Usually guys will use the forward part of their shoulder, but with Donald being the taller guy and Conor being shorter and having control over Donalds arms, he was hitting him with tops of the shoulder where most of the bone is.  Brutal."
sports,fewqm8n,t3_eqseo2,1579418028.0,"That ""Dirty Boxing"" with the shoulders was insane and I've never seen it used so effectively.  Donalds height advantage was actually used against him.  I wish the fight didn't go down so quick they way it did, but gotta give it to Conor on well thought out attack."
