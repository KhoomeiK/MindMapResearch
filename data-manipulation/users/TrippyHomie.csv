He played a song or two he wasn't even featured on but kept yelling his 'HAAAN', and then completely inexplicably played the entire instrumental song of Smells Like Teen Spirit while he smoked a joint and walked around, didn't even mention it at all."

phish,fenz8bt,t1_fekpg93,1579292989.0,Most people don't share the sentiment because the address is in Queens and they call themselves a music venue in Queens.  I don't know how you could possibly call Flushing and Jamiaca and all LI but you do you.
lacrosse,femd1xp,t1_fem22k9,1579249294.0,Accidental or incidental contact is fine but actual body checking is against the rules. You can't just lay someone out for having their head down.

EA_NHL,fe62uoj,t1_fe5q6c7,1578880535.0,Ok so the animation sucks but he still slaps it backwards with his stick which isn’t a physics glitch.    Also seems like going down earlier would’ve made this ‘non-opportunity’ not go in the net so maybe not the best ‘101’ advice.  You’re still acting like the puck magically picked up speed.
EA_NHL,fe5m934,t1_fe5dp22,1578871268.0,"He hit the puck backwards with his stick, usually when you hit a puck with your stick it accelerates...  He should've been in the butterfly way earlier."

Probably all hands on deck right after the show to at least get the stage out and court down as it seems morning shootaround for NBA teams is usually around 8 AM.  These arenas sometimes do NBA/NHL in the afternoon and then the other at night also so they can definitely turn things over in a hurry,"

seriouseats,fdy3a8n,t1_fdy0u69,1578775601.0,100%.  It works the same with other foods also.  I know plenty of people who won’t eat sushi because they don’t like the taste/texture of raw fish but will eat the same fish grilled.

CannabisExtracts,fdg940h,t1_fdg3fka,1578385314.0,"There's tons of dispensaries in CO that grow their own weed and then have extraction companies run it for them so it is completely possible.  Still shitty customer service, but here the way it works is you usually become a 'member' (if you're medical) by making your dispensary your caregiver and get deals at your dispensary, in turn they get the rights to grow the plants you were allotted.  I worked in an extraction that had a grow, but we also ran weed for a few dispensaries, sometimes it would be absolute shit but owners like to make money and would want it ran."

Being from NY has turned me into a huge pizza snob over the years and I struggled to find actually good pizza in the rest of the US, it's bearable but not like I crave it.  I also had an incredible pizza place at home so the comparison doesn't help.  Most of the pizza I had across Sicily was pretty great though.  


Realistically I just love pizza but that has also turned me into this where I straight refuse to eat bad pizza."
hockey,fddghkn,t1_fdd3v67,1578311236.0,You also just get your stick chopped down or lifted in this situation most of time if it wasn't a bang-bang play on a turnover with McCann coming the other way and instantly lose the puck when you miss.  D isn't usually chasing you like this.
hockey,fddfy0r,t1_fdcxqug,1578310531.0,OP seemingly studies the rules but doesn't watch hockey because this never ever ever gets called as hooking or at all.  It's easy enough to see this as a stick lift since Brown makes contact for like an instant as McCann's stick is already going up and down and doesn't pull him back.  Maybe slashing if it was on a superstar but this play realistically never gets called in the NHL ever and doesn't need to be.  Barely anything gets called on checks near the hand unless the offender actually winds up.
hockey,fddfu22,t1_fdd0gsq,1578310383.0,"If you watch literally any NHL hockey at all you should know that never ever gets called as hooking.  They only call it if you actually pull someone back significantly with your blade.   It basically looks like a stick lift, they don't call hooking unless you actually slow down someone's forward progress.  Maybe they call slashing there which isn't 'textbook' but come on, this play doesn't called in the pros ever.

Barely any check on the hands ever gets called unless you take a baseball swing at them."

Don't know many dispensaries that allow returns, it essentially has to be defective so I would've fought with them about the cart but they don't have to take back anything perishable (flower, concentrates, edibles, etc)."
AskReddit,fdde7go,t1_fd31bfb,1578308144.0,"This is the pretty typical NYC accent, dropping the last consonant for an a, plus things like aw for o in words like 'cawfee.'  Like 'Hey, I'm gonna head to the staw for some liqua before we make those burgas for dinna.'

aww,fd1r0g2,t1_fd1o5os,1578135441.0,"I do have trained pets and have my entire life, they're most likely reacting to the sound or smell because they sometimes get it, how often do people really drink hot chocolate?  My dog occasionally gets a baby carrot from the fridge but he still comes to see what's up whenever he hears the fridge open.  Especially from this single 30 second reddit clip I don't see how you can claim this constantly happens, all but one golden are all still running up after he's finished with the hot chocolates.  I agree it's also not healthy if overdone.
