I canâ€™t address each individual point but all I can say is that our speeds/feeds/ tip height are all preset. 
Plug in thickness, amperage (we have 4 heads), and it does the rest. 

That being said I will absolutely relay this info up the chain and thank you so much for the input. I genuinely appreciate your time and help.

Edit: Thank you to whomever gave this man gold. He def deserves it!!!"
ManufacturingPorn,felq59d,t1_felmsvc,1579228229.0,"Dude I appreciate your input. 
I havenâ€™t been formally trained on the machine so I just know how to make it cut parts somewhat efficiently. 

We have been going through consumables at a high rate but we figured it was just how the machine ran. 
The Hornet rep trained my manager and the operator on how it â€œshould be ranâ€ and Iâ€™m just going off that. 
Any more input you have would be awesome. 
Weâ€™ve never done any edge piercing even though thatâ€™s an option."

ManufacturingPorn,felk0xo,t1_felhp7o,1579224034.0,"To be completely honest, 
Iâ€™m lead machinist, not burn table operator. 
Our operator passed away unexpectedly about 6 months ago and I just run the machine to keep production up. 
I donâ€™t know the ins and outs of burning but was trained on the machine through our production manager. 
If thereâ€™s something I could be doing differently,  Iâ€™m all ears."
