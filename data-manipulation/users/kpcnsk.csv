canon,ffigf94,t3_etot6c,1579973261.0,"First of all, ignore all the advice here about shooting RAW. If jpeg works for you, then do it. You obviously are aware of its limitations, so if you encounter a situation where you think you might need RAW, you can always switch for those shoots. And if you’re shooting jpeg, make sure you look into Canon’s color profiles. They’re really handy for getting the look you want straight out of camera.

Assuming the shutter count is low, I’d go for the 7D. I had one and loved it, never had a problem with it. In fact, it was my step up from my 40D. Don’t quote me on this, but the shutter life expectancy on the 7D is rather high. It was designed with professional in mind, so it’s designed to take a beating. That doesn’t mean it’ll last forever... actual shutter lifespan is highly variable, and there’s no way of predicting when one will go. I’d consider anything under 50K to be low, considering the age of the 7D.

The 7D isn’t the strongest performer in low light, but in a studio situation it’ll do well enough. Fast lenses also help tremendously. I was a big fan of the Sigma 30 when I was out and about. The 35 and 50 Art lenses for full frame are sharper. Just make sure to take the time to calibrate any 3rd party lens properly and you should do ok. 

Good luck!"

canon,ff9f4m0,t1_ff8jzm4,1579711675.0,"I don't think anyone's getting angry. Calling something a ""kit lens"" has a negative connotation, however. It's pretty dismissive, and that can be confusing to new photographers who are trying to figure out the best way to spend their money.

And fwiw, *every* lens is designed to a price point. That's how Canon makes money.

I'm not disagreeing with you, by the way, about your assessment that the 24-70 beats out the 24-105 on sharpness and aperture. But the extra reach, lower price, size, weight, and image stabilization might be features that make the 24-105 the better choice. Again, it all depends on how you're going to be using the lens."
canon,ff7a4uy,t1_ff45iwy,1579644355.0,">basically a kit lens that was designed to sell with the 5D mk2

First of all, the 5Dmk2 was released in 2008, and the 24-105 f4 IS L II was released in 2016. Even if you were thinking about the version 2 of the lens and the 5Dmk4, which were released at the same time, we're talking about the 5Dmk4, Canon's flagship DSLR. Canon makes some crappy marketing decisions sometimes, but when it comes to their high end products, they don't generally pull their punches. 

Secondly, just because a lens comes bundled with a camera (thus a kit lens) does not mean that it's an inferior lens. The utilitarian 24-105 might not be the sexiest L glass out there, but it does a lot of things well enough that you'll find it is well regarded for what it does.

Finally, the 24-70 II isn't ""the best"" L series lens either. As you probably know, there are faster lenses, wider lenses, sharper lenses, lenses with more reach, lighter lenses... ""best"" is ultimately going to depend on your application, not the aperture of the lens."
canon,ff77ssm,t1_ff4h144,1579642807.0,"This is what makes the 24-105 a better travel lens, and when the other factors are added in, the better value overall.  I prefer fast lenses and the 24-70 is wonderful glass, but it is slightly heavier and bulkier, and that makes a big difference when traveling."
reddeadredemption,ff6xg1o,t1_ff694xy,1579636881.0,"I've been doing so RDO photography for a while, and I find that going through Xbox live, either on phone or PC, is cumbersome and slow. Rockstar's social club is useless, as it has a very low file limit. As a result, I take screenshots and use Microsoft OneDrive, which makes the files available to either the phone (though the OneDrive app) or the PC through the web browser. OneDrive accounts are free, for a relatively small storage capacity.

I've turned of automatic uploads to Xbox live. When I'm ready to send a batch to another device, I go into my captures on my Xbox, switch the view to list view, and select the captures I want to upload. Then hop over to the app or web browser on your other device and download to your heart's content. Don't forget to delete the files from OneDrive when you're done, so that you're ready for your next upload. You can also clean up the files on your Xbox just to keep things tidy.

One bonus feature: the files get date stamped to their upload date, so it's a bit easier to keep them sorted.

One caveat: how fast this works depends on your upstream bandwidth, just like Xbox Live, but the OneDrive servers seem much more responsive when downloading, IMO. When uploading from the Xbox, I usually give it a bit more time to write all the files before deleting, especially if it's a large batch (50+ photos)."

fountainpens,fenh3z6,t1_feldrcy,1579284558.0,"The 912 is a great pen. It writes well, feels comfortable, and has classic styling. I like the plunger reservoir on the 823 more, though, and the brown 823 is such a wonderful, distinctive color. Every time I pull out the 823 I smile.

Regarding getting a 823 FA, I'd recommend contacting [Tokyo Pen Shop Quill](https://www.japanshop-quill.com/index.htm) directly well in advance of your travels. They've recently updated their website and as far as I can tell, have removed mention of the fact that they don't export the 823 FA, so maybe that's an option again? In any case, they do mention that they're often sold out of the FA, so there is a waiting list. When I purchased mine, it was about 3 months before I received it. Absolutely was worth the wait, though."
fountainpens,fel8bte,t1_fekyz5r,1579216244.0,"The FA is fantastic, it is one of my two dailies (the other being a Wancher Sailor Pro Gear). I went through a number of pens in getting to the 823, but it's definitely one I'm planning to keep for the rest of my days. I love the flex nib, although the 823 version of the nib doesn't behave quite as well as the 912 FA that I have. But of course the 823 body is such a joy to hold and behold, that it wins in the end. I don't go for the flex-to-the-max look that some people like with when using their flex pens, but I really like the subtle line variability that happens naturally. It makes the script very expressive.

I got my 823 FA direct from Tokyo Pen Shop Quill, but I think they no longer sell the FA for export. So if you're not in Japan, you'll have to keep your eyes out on the secondary market, use a local buying service, or travel there yourself. They do pop up pretty regularly on /r/Pen_Swap, although they sell pretty fast. 

If you're unsure about whether you'd like the FA nib, the 912 is a good test. It's a bit smaller than the 823, both in the barrel and the nib, but there close enough that you can get a good idea of whether you like the flex. If it's too much, a stiffer (and cheaper) option is the Pilot Falcon. It won't give as much line variation as the FA, but it does give some."

Some people don't like it because you can accidentally turn it and change your settings if you're not careful. But I think it's great, as you can set it to control a number of different parameters. I use it to do exposure compensation or aperture most of the time.

As an added benefit, you'll be able to get used to using the control ring as part of your process, so that when you acquire RF lenses, you'll have no trouble making use of their built-in control ring."
canon,fdklx73,t3_elv9r4,1578506277.0,"RP owner here. The autofocus is good. Eye autofocus isn't perfect, and works best with still, well lit subjects. Movement tracking is reasonably good as well. One thing the RP has in its favor is that it performs well at higher ISOs, and I find that I can easily go up to ISO 3200 without a severe hit to image quality. Even 6400 is capable of producing clear images. 

Adapted EF glass functions natively. I've found this to be true with both Canon and 3rd party lenses like Sigma's Art line. So you can save a lot of money by getting EF glass, and in some cases, it's your only option. I have the RF 35, 50, and 24-105, and they're all worth it. But EF versions would do fine as well. The only downside to using adapted glass is that it can make the camera front heavy, depending on the lens. Make sure to get an extension grip if you're going to be using heavier EF glass, your wrists will thank you."
canon,fdix1cg,t3_elj81p,1578452980.0,"You're talking about the 100mm 2.8 L Macro lens, right? If so, that's not an exceptionally heavy lens. I have an M5 (body is similar to the M50), and I regularly mount an adapted Sigma 50mm Art (heavier lens) on it with no problems. The M50 will definitely hold up just fine. The camera strap points on the body should be ok to support the lens, but just don't go swinging it around unnecessarily. As others mention, I suspect your wrist will fail faster than the strap lugs.

You could use the tripod mount on the adapter, just be careful it doesn't unscrew. A little loctite will help keep the thumbscrew in place. Personally, I remove the mount point from my adapter, as I like to support the lens with my left hand when shooting, and I find the mount to be right where I want my hand to go. For me, the bigger problem with the 100mm is that it is an IS lens, and it'll drain those puny LP-E17 batteries pretty quick if you're not careful. Easiest thing to do is turn off IS on the lens when you don't need it."

Every EF and EF-S lens that I've ever had, including lenses from both Canon and Sigma, has functioned perfectly well on my M5 with the EF to EF-M adapter.

I used to have a Sigma 18-250 EF which I used with an adapter on my M2 and M5. It provided decent image quality. In good light, it was sharp enough at the center, but the corners were soft. It also wasn’t a great low light performer (all-in-ones never are) but it was stabilized. So when I travelled, I would take the Sigma and a small fast prime (30 or 35mm) for nights or indoors.

The truth is, I don't know that operator error is the cause of the problem, I merely suggested that it COULD be part of the problem. To really be helpful in that regard, I'd need to see examples of the shots, as others in this thread have requested. If it is operator error, it could be something basic like inappropriate shutter speed selection or unsteady hands. Or maybe it's something more advanced, like poor focus and recompose technique. Maybe the OP has an unrealistic expectation of what kind of sharpness to expect from their gear. There's a lot of possibilities when it comes to user error.

FWIW, suggesting that there may be user error, as I and others have done, is not ""blaming the photographer."" User error when it comes to technological devices is not uncommon. Furthermore, many people have self-serving bias, and it's one of the hardest things to overcome when learning a skill. If I've made an assumption, it's that the OP is like myself and most people that I know, which is to say that it's far easier to look outwards rather than inwards when solving problems.

That's not to say that lemons don't exist. Cameras and optics are complicated devices and it's impossible to test every feature of every manufactured device fully.
