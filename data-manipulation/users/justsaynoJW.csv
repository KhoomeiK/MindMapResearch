You get to decide what you want the structure of you life to be, not some weird old men. Want to travel the world in a van? You can do that! Want to go to dance school and become a performer? You can do that too! Your life is an empty canvas right now, and the possibilities are endless. On the other hand, I totally get why you would miss the only lifestyle you’ve ever known, but just try to think of this as an opportunity. You could be stuck living your life only one exact way and then you die. Or you could go live it 50 different ways and then you still die, but at least it wasn’t boring.  Lol! Sorry if they didn’t make you laugh. But it did me. Anyway, my point is that it’s normally to miss the companionship and security, but that isn’t your only shot at structure and meaningful relationships."

I think you set the expectation for yourself. If you are only ever seen with make-up, then yes others might find it off if you don’t wear it. But if you never wear it, no one expects you to. Or like me, I wear it usually, but I go without often enough that I don’t think anyone would think it strange to see me without it. Then again I also think it’s no one’s business what I do with my own face or body."
