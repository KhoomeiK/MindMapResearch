bipolar,fe46xm5,t3_ennldo,1578856346.0,Throughly cleaned the kitchen yesterday after finally taking my lithium after several days without it. Going to go shopping today for healthy meals with my SO. Going to go to the gym to get my daily dose of Endorphins and try not to think about the creepy guy at work that I had to report to HR. Followed by some Lord of the Rings.
bipolar,fcxhzgb,t1_fcx4ker,1578063402.0,"Thank you, that means a lot to me. It's nice that someone out there understands and cares. I think a lot about what Jim Carey once said, ""I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which, was that you can fail at what you don’t want so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love” I hope that you continue to paint as well and keep inspiring people like me."
bipolar,fcwklww,t1_fcugurs,1578028215.0,"I'm glad my comment meant something to you. I can relate to having a talent but not pursuing it either because of not wanting to be poor, essentially. However, my parents were always supportive and me always rebellious, destined to find my own way. I've started painting because it helps me make sense and understand my emotions. I'm no where near your talent. My art was always singing, but I sort of gave it up."
bipolar,fcu8whr,t3_eix8rd,1577975342.0,"Are you trained in art? Just curious, because this abstract painting is amazing and I would love some tips."
