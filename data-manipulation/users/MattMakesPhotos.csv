What employment is has also been redefined across the western world to basically stats pad. A far better measure is those underemployed as having some casual job 10 hours a week is not enough unless you're a student at home or something.

AskReddit,fdsoe9i,t1_fdrhymw,1578705866.0,"Climate change is changing how many days hazard reduction burns can safely be performed during the other seasons. There are several conditions that must be met relating to temp, humidity and wind before these burns can happen. The days of these conditions has been reducing.

The fire services in question have been defunded recently and attempts by fire chiefs to meet with government officials to warn about this have all been rejected. These warnings for around 2020 have been predicted since 2000.

Then there is logging of old growth forest in some areas, some of these forests are so moisture rich that they provide natural fire barriers as they do not burn - at least not generally. 

So this has allowed a lot of accumulation of dry fuel.  Many fires have been lit by lightning strike.

Although there are some arsonists, 24 people charged with deliberately lighting fires, we are seeing Cambridge analytica style misinformation campaigns targeting Australians right now. These first blamed the greens for not allowing hazard reduction burns (even though they don't have the power to stop them, and their policy actually supports them) and now this has moved to blaming arsonists - only a few of which actually managed to light a fire. This is to deflect blame for government negligence as mentioned above.

Unfortunately these misinformation campaigns have gained traction even though the fire and police services have both come out and said the information is incorrect.

Hope that gives you a good summary. I've done a lot of hiking in burnt areas to product a photo project called ASH."

The LNP commits offense after offense in this country. They blatantly take money from the people that is meant to go to services like fire services, and they hand it to their mates and themselves through blatantly bullshit deals that aren't pulled up because the first thing they all did was sack and defund anyone that would do that.
