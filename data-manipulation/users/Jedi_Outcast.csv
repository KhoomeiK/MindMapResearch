This parallels the United States.  It's not a country where ""all men are equal"" it's a declaration of intent to strive to be a country where everyone is equal.  There will be missteps and set backs but it's what we strive to be.  It's the same with the Federation. It strives to be a force of good, but it won't always have that role."
