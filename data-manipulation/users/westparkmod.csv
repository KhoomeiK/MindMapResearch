You realize that the contractors who ran those facilities will just delay until death and pay out fractions of the actual damages.  Pretty poor outcome if you ask me."
IAmA,fetdhpx,t3_eqka8n,1579374228.0,"When you say “end the welfare state” do you mean social safety nets for the poor or corporate and farming subsidies? 

What about programs like the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, a government entitlement program that benefits people made sick while developing nuclear weapons?  Should those people just sue the individual companies?  That could potentially bankrupt those companies (who contracted with and to the benefit of the Federal Government)."
todayilearned,fen2ci8,t1_fen08o9,1579275417.0,"Akita’s and Chows are cut from a similar cloth.  One difference is the amount of fur on the Chow makes its expression somewhat hidden.  And the singular bonding and territorial nature of Chows is just a bad combo. 

I made a mistake getting an Akita as my first dog out of college.  She was awesome and super friendly and well trained.  I used to take her to schools for education classes.  It took a long time and a lot of work to get her to that point.  I have an Am Staff mix now and he’s a dream to train. So much easier in comparison to the Akita."
todayilearned,femz4y2,t1_fem540i,1579273298.0,"I spent a few years working around animals and dogs.  I have a very difficult time reading Chow-Chows.  I owned an Akita for about a decade and am familiar with stoic aloof breeds.  Generally speaking, Chows are in their own class there.  And behind the aloof and unreadable exterior is a dog that isn’t super friendly with people outside of its unit.  Again generally speaking."
