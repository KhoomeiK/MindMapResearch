Bellingham,ff89u0n,t3_erqnw9,1579670287.0,"Northwest gastroenterology is great. In reply to the other comment, I think Dr. Levenson has retired from NW gastro unfortunately, that guy was hilarious and brilliant.

edit: also you're obviously free to make your own healthcare choices but naturopaths don't have rigorous training and their education involves a lot of pseudoscience. GI docs do undergrad, 4 years of med school, 3-4 years of internal medicine residency, and then at least 3 years of GI fellowship before they practice as a GI specialist."

politics,ff59dd3,t1_ff58qt4,1579584173.0,"Nope, those are my real projected numbers, that's the power of compounding interest. My total costs have been about $70,000 per year (~$50,000 in tuition), so with interest I'll be around $300,000 at graduation and my total amount paid over the next 10 years will be over $500,000. This isn't atypical at all. 

And no the McDonald's comparison isn't exaggerated either. I'll probably work around 70-80 hours per week in residency if I'm reallyyyy lucky. Minimum wage in Washington state is now $13.50 per hour..do the math, that's around $50,000 at 70 hours per week, about the same pay as most residency programs I've interviewed with."
politics,ff58ggg,t1_ff57e7x,1579583336.0,"What numbers are exaggerated? Huh, that's a strange question. There are a lot more reasons to go into medicine than the money. I love medicine and taking care of people, I definitely feel grateful to be in my position...I have worked my ass off to be here. But that doesn't mean it's all roses, people have a skewed idea of doctors. Medical school has gotten much more expensive in the last decade, I literally just spent over $5,000 to apply to and fly around the country interviewing for residency positions after spending almost $3,000 on board exam fees. People are taking out extra loans to cover moving expenses to go work at a job for years that pays less than the minimum wage in my state. I think if the general public knew that the resident doctor taking care of them in the hospital had been up for over 24 hours and was getting paid less than a teenager at McDonald's they would be outraged."
politics,ff4xmnc,t1_ff4q8xf,1579574899.0,"That’s with tens of thousands a year in malpractice cost, and around $90,000 of that will be taken away for taxes. Also you have to make payments on high interest federal loans (~7%) that compounds on itself constantly. And that’s after 3-7 years of residency and potentially 1-3 years of fellowship where you get paid $50-60k per year while working over 80 hours per week with essentially no normal workplace protections (no breaks, no negotiation of terms, etc). There is also the massive opportunity cost of not being able to make any money in your 20’s, with no contributions to your 401k etc. and losing out on all the time that would’ve been accumulating interest and growing. It’s also difficult to get loans to buy a house or car, etc. with this kind of debt burden. My total will be about $300,000 but will reach over half a million by the time I can pay all of it back. And I’ve been stingy as hell and living on less than $20,000 per year for all non-tuition expenses. I had several mentors in their late 50’s that still had debt from med school, granted they obviously must have made poor financial decisions but still, it’s a bit terrifying. And I don’t buy for a second that Sanders or Warren are going to forgive debt for medical students, law students, etc. there is going to be wayyy too much push back against that as the public perception is that they are all rich. I remember reading that Warren was going to cap hers at $50,000 for graduate schools, which is a drop in the bucket when you’re looking at a $500,000 mountain of debt. I don’t think the general public understands the sacrifices and the expense of medical training and no one gives a shit because they see news stories about outrageous medical bills and blame rich doctors. (See recent Washington Post opinion piece comparing a surgeon who removed their infected appendix to being a “mugger”.)"
medicalschool,ff43lu5,t3_erdvth,1579554799.0,"My girlfriend is in a combined NP/nurse midwife program, she’s been doing all online classes while working full time as an RN and then has to do just 600 clinical hours after which she can independently care for pregnant women AND babies up to 1 year old. Seems crazy. I wouldn’t even feel comfortable providing primary care to babies and I’ve done hundreds of hours of pediatrics."
medicalschool,ff438cv,t1_ff3qob7,1579554568.0,Nursing practice isn’t the same as practice as a clinician. I worked for years in healthcare before med school but that sure as hell doesn’t count towards my clinical hours of training to be a physician.
medicalschool,ff42tb4,t1_ff3wbas,1579554311.0,"Double the time in class? Lol. We had 40 hours of lectures per week, many of which were self study and took much longer than the allotted time to get through. As you know, physicians can’t practice until finishing residency so this is part of the training hours. That’s part of the reason why people are upset, why is having an MD without residency a useless degree if they have substantially more training than NPs."
interestingasfuck,ff2doo2,t1_ff2cw0d,1579501923.0,"There are studies that show a majority of sex trafficking victims (\~85%) have contact with health care providers at least once while being trafficked. Early in med school we had hours of lectures on identifying victims and how often we just have no idea that a patient is being trafficked or abused. We also get lots of training in identifying signs of abuse in different age groups, from infants to the elderly. Lots you can tell from patterns/mechanisms of injuries, etc."

Then they owed money to vendors for supplies and couldn’t pay them..then they couldn’t do a lot of basic healthcare because vendors weren’t sending more supplies until they got paid, which they couldn’t. They also hired tons of specialists but didn’t have the volume of patients and referrals from primary care to make this profitable. Then their reputation got even worse and the hospital patients became largely homeless/Medicare/undocumented patients who were receiving good expensive care, but these people can’t pay so then the hospital was losing even more money, and the spiral continued until they finally had to give up."
