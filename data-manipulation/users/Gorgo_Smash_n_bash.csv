The safe harbor time (10pm or 12am to 6am) is when they lift the full prohibition, but community standards still apply. However, community standards aren’t an absolute, the FCC investigates the context. 

So generally, if a fictional character says “shit!” as a mere expletive or a song has the word in it, then that would probably be ok...if they say “I am going to take a shit” then that could be grounds for a fine. If a nonfictional character like an actor on a talk show or a radio DJ says “shit!” as an expletive then they can still fine that because it provides no substance to a narrative. It’s intentionally not defined in law, and they follow the Supreme Court idea of “I know it when I see it” reasoning."

Don’t try cooking caramelized onions or heat things other than water, cleaning your pot gets old reeeeeal quick and you’ll waste fuel. Just boil the water you need and add it to the package of knorr sides, oatmeal, or dehydrated meal packet itself. It’s a good idea to make a packet cozy out of reflectix to let your food rehydrate and stay hot. If you are wanting to bring a white gas stove just because that’s what you own, then consider getting a canister stove instead, they’re lighter and the fuel is available in almost every town."

A friend of mine, who is a hospice nurse, got a dirty needle stick from a terminal AIDS patient’s injection needle and her job gave her monthly tests for 2 years.

An employee of NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or any government agency with conservation and management responsibilities, who receive the part in the course of official duties.

A permit holder or listed under another person's permit as a Co-Investigator or Authorized Recipient, which authorizes that species.
