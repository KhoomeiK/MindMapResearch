TrueLit,ffypo6a,t1_ffy29sa,1580352098.0,"Same with me, I felt that Ursula Monkton taking over the household was the only interesting part. There was too much left unexplained and mysterious, as if it was too immensely ineffable for both the protagonist and the reader to understand."
harrypotter,ffyni31,t1_ffxgkyd,1580350624.0,Surely there would've been more than one great dark wizard in Hogwarts' history. How much more interesting would it be if Voldemort was just a minor blip.

harrypotter,fej5vvz,t1_feiba04,1579158153.0,"Curiously, ""At Peace"" appeared on the clock face one day, and all but one clock hand pointed towards it. At some point in time each of the red-headed family members had secretly sat down in front of the clock and stared at the unmoving hand. Perhaps it was stuck, or cursed, or maybe it had been broken a very long time ago; truly, and ineffably, magic would always have its mysteries. 

Yet, many, many years later, when an old man took his final breath, that stubborn clock hand slowly turned, and so the grinning portrait of a young boy came to meet his brother, one a spitting image of the other."

ShitAmericansSay,fd6k1lv,t1_fd621sp,1578192218.0,"Australia was a melting pot during the early days of colonisation and especially during the 19th century gold rushes which brought in a massive influx of people worldwide. In Australian schools, you learn very early on about this immigration, mainly of Irish and Scottish people, who were said to have greatly influenced our drinking culture (not sure if the whole ""drunk accent"" theory is deserving of any merit). While Irish English and Scottish English varieties are rhotic, meaning they pronounce the r after a vowel (like American English), it seems all dialects and accents of immigrants across the globe were levelled and a broad non-rhotic variety prevailed."
