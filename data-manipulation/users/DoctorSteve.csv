I don't think streamers should demand donations. But if we're already accepting that girl streamers are popular among men for sexual reasons (as I have seen top comments on this post say), then this can simply be an extension of that sexuality. 

The conclusion that ""don't bully or guilt people into donating"" is an odd one when they could just find someone else to watch. She is literally getting donations by yelling at people to give her donations. Don't hate the player.

EDIT: But on a personal note, I know someone who would beg for money like that and I cut her off. I don't think it's right to beg for money. But I view this differently as this is a stream where donations are part of the structure, and not us at a group dinner table."
