videos,fffcms5,t1_fffca5r,1579881018.0,There are so many other ways to get oil though. Not everything has to be fried. When I cook I’m using a few tablespoons of oil or sometimes none of I’m using something like pork belly which can provide all the oil. What’s more likely: not deep frying food if you don’t have enough oil or scooping sludge out of the gutter so you can fry something?

That is ridiculous.

Edit: sorry my numbers were in 1,000 metric tons for US consumption so I adjusted numbers.
