college,fee6qvg,t3_eomjwv,1579027551.0,"I study purely based on the class.... I’m a marketing major and some of my classes come very naturally and easy to me so little studying is required (maybe an hour or 2 the day before the exam). Although, for Finance last semester I studied roughly 8 hours a week and another 18 hours between the 2 days before the exam.

also: I never studied until I got to college and it took a while for me to learn how to study properly and not just re read class work

yes, I’m human too actually"
