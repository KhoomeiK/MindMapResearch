wwiipics,ffmyufl,t1_ffltgpm,1580060268.0,"I agree there are ameliorating circumstances when we consider some the people who were fighting for Germany at the end of the war. Can we really expect a 13 year old, indoctrinated into Hitler Youth since preschool, do understand right and wrong as we do? What about the thousands punished in  prison or camps once once for their anti-Nazi speech so kept their heads down the rest of the war? Again it’s not many, but some did have that happen. Then, there were those that volunteered for the most bloody body disposal duties because they enjoyed the mass extermination. 

It’s tough to see the individual in the mass of historical behavior. There were millions of stories that made up Germany’s collective government and wartime actions. I think it’s good to think about lots of sides to the stories."

You may find that the skills and experience you had as a volunteer will prepare you for things you can’t foresee at this moment. Sure, you did it for a girl, but what is youth for, if not to make some silly choices in the name of love? Plus, you’re liable to see your time in class as a true investment.

AskReddit,ffjiqvh,t1_ffjgtty,1579999134.0,"My grandpa was one of the soldiers who had to go through POW and displaced persons camps in Europe in ‘45and tell them there wasn’t anyplace better for them but at least they were free. He took a picture of the pile of dead bodies they had to bury every morning. I often think about how that would change someone— even seeing it, let alone having to touch and bury people who were looking to you for good news. 

Or maybe by that point they knew no news could possibly be *that* good. That they were already dead, their bodies just didn’t give up until they wouldn’t give the Germans the satisfaction of dying on their watch. I don’t know. Like I said, I think about it, though."
