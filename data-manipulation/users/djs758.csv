Screenwriting,ffd1yxr,t3_esvecg,1579811825.0,"I think you could have something here, but it's quite wordy at this point. Consider reading the opening of The Social Network. It's a date scene, quickly established. You need to get us to the messier bits of dialogue more quickly, and there needs to be more of a spark--drama via a confrontation or accusation; maybe something comical...it's just a long setup, and sometimes they just agree too much. 

Beware of repetition. For example, line one. Ext. + Outside = repetition. Also, the next line says restaurant. Then your next scene. Int. Restaurant and then a line about being inside the restaurant. Side note: Sarah and Conor reminded me of Sarah Connor, from Terminator. It's an unnecessary distraction. The writing is better when we get to the dialogue, but that, too, is quite wordy. I'm not a fan of characters that say ""erm,"" as I have never heard that used in real-life conversation. I also think date questions would likely move into some question of whether they are physically attracted to each other. 

Bottom of page 5. ""I can do?"" ...not sure what's happening here; maybe a missing line or two

Only at the end does it begin to feel like a comedy--but you have a 650-word monologue.  The speech in King's Speech is about 250 words, and that's in a feature. If that feature about a speech can climax on a 250-word monologue, you can almost certainly tell that story in less than 200 words.

Either you're wrong or the reviewer is wrong. I know it seems absurd, but if you're that confident in your work, consider paying for another read and see if you get the same result.

Let's say that the abuser goes to prison or therapy or breaks some addiction cycle and he is no longer an abuser...your story can't just discount the effect of the abuse on his victim. It seems like a hokey plot because it sends the wrong message. And the reality is that women do return to abusers--but almost 100% of the time the man is still abusive. 

After reading Hotspurjr's comment, I went and read about the incident with your sister. I'd suggest there is room for her perspective, and that you try understanding and sympathizing with her POV before doing anything else. And if you do write this, make sure her POV is well-represented. Rather than read/watch things that empathize with your perspective (and thus make you feel justified), try finding material to help you empathize with her's. It's unlikely you will rekindle any form of relationship with her until you take steps to prove you aren't going to hit her again. Maybe that was just a one-time thing because she almost killed your nephew. But now it's up to you to prove that. You've burned your moral authority and the bridge to helping your nephew, maybe even knowing him. It will not be easy to rebuild--you need to become your sister's supporter and not her critic, if that's possible. Having now read the backstory, your post reeks of self-justification for your own harmful actions, rather than a desire to tell a compelling story.

Screenwriting,fdqblv4,t3_emqbn0,1578662183.0,"Clicked to see how many people would say don't make it perfect. 

My personal tip is to write your outline in a way where you can see all of it at once. Whether that means a large dry-erase board or notecards taped to a wall or 100 sticky notes or one piece of a paper--make it something that you can see without having to flip through pages. And make it physical. 

The reality is that every writer has to figure out their own process. Figuring out that process--and doing it wrong--is part of what makes you a better writer. I have tried writing with no outline. A detailed paper outline. And a partial outline. My preference is to use note cards taped to a large foam board that hangs on my wall behind my monitors. I use painters tape so I can remove and replace the cards easily. I move each card down and tape it below my screen as I write it. Don't be afraid to experiment."

Consider whether you are doing this just for fun and to learn...or whether you want to sell this. I think it would be a tough pitch, considering that Baldersnatch apparently cost twice as much and took twice as long to produce...and the episode is rated 7.2 on IMDb off a show average of 8.8. Get too complicated with various choices, and it becomes more like a video game as the production costs skyrocket. Do too little and people will wonder why it just isn't a film."

Another might write the scene and try to make it fit wherever they are in their current plot. 

There are positives and negatives to both plotting strategies."
