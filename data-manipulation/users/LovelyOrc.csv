HumansBeingBros,fc2zef3,t3_efwyr6,1577377954.0,Okay unless the sister is way younger why wouldn't you just get two controllers for them by yourself? That's basically asking your kids to fight.

People want to make more money off of already popular things and giving the protagonist another gender or race is just the easiest possible way to make it seem fresh. You can critizise this and you're right for doing so but I wish people would shut up about it being some SJW agenda. It's just fucking capitalism."
