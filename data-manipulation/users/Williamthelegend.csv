socialanxiety,ffj6j8q,t3_etwpzm,1579991648.0,I've had anxiety about this my entire life. Being worried that I was mentally disabled. I've always felt like I wasn't smart enough.

socialanxiety,ffgjkjm,t3_ethi5o,1579907712.0,Yeah that is the absolute worst.
socialanxiety,fff9iam,t3_etbbue,1579879024.0,Yeah I do that.
TeslaModel3,ff6mnpn,t1_ff62isd,1579630454.0,"Yeah exactly. AWD is the only feature I really care about. Longer range is nice. But I would take a brand new SRP over an older long range that's been in an accident and has had 2 years of battery degradation and warranty loss. 
I really have no reason to buy this over a new tesla unless they drop the price significantly. Like I might even hold to $40,000. Which they probably won't go for. 
But yeah they're the ones who need to convince me to buy this over a new tesla. They're probably in more of a hurry to sell this than I am to buy it."
