I'm sure you would agree that some people find labels very important to them. In fact, I would infer that due to this reply, you find the label ""soft boy"" to be pretty important to you, so it really doesn't make sense as to why you would say that identifiers are ""innocuous"". I'm allowed to dislike someone's tendency to infantilize themselves by calling themself something like a ""little soft boy.""

 

>This post you made, it's pointless. Your opinion, it's irrelevant. 

Most opinions are irrelevant, but if we ignored people's opinions all the time nothing would get talked about.

&#x200B;

>And it's a shame you can come on here and Bully trans men who experience their transition, and maleness, in a way that's different from what you consider valid.

I would argue I have not bullied any trans men. I can't force anyone to change what they call themself, I can only make an appeal for them to consider another label. 

&#x200B;

> Being trans is enough to be fetishized. It doesn't matter if you're more fem, or if you use terms that feminized you. You're going to get fetishized by somebody out there who's attracted to trans men. 

Are you saying that we should let people encourage fetishizing trans men because it's going to happen anyway? I don't really see how that is a good line of reasoning.

&#x200B;

>Should we now shame people for coming out as a trans man, because it is considered a fetish to some people?... No. That's not logical. We're not asking to be fetishized. And even if somebody is asking to be fetishized, it has nothing at all to do with you. It's their business. 

I never said that. I didn't even imply it. Of course it's not logical. And I'm not saying to shame people for calling themselves soft boys, my core reasoning is to get ""soft boys"" to consider how their label could impact stereotypes that people gather about trans men.

&#x200B;

>Like literally, in my case. I have no problem with expressing my sexuality as it is. And I have no problem with using my sexuality to earn an income. Legally of course. I don't think there's anything wrong with someone being attracted to someone else for being trans. 

I don't see how you selling your body is relevant to the conversation, so sorry if I missed your point here.

&#x200B;

>What I think is often wrong in fetishizing trans people, is how a person treats a trans person because of the fetish they have. But I have seen plenty of trans attracted individuals be respectful, and treat each trans person as an equal. We don't exactly have control over how other people view us. We don't get to dictate how Society sees certain subcultures. Any  deviation from the norm will get fetishized. Hard fact... And it's not our responsibility to conform ourselves to fit certain standards, just because other people view Who We Are in an invalidating or overly sexual way. That is not our fault. And it is not our job to change how people feel about trans people.

It's not our job to control how people view trans people, it's just our responsibility. I care very much how the mainstream views trans people because it impacts me. Why should I not care? Furthermore, If we don't promote the idea that trans men are men, and instead avoid that label altogether, then people will always treat us like we're not men. In short, if we tell people that we're not men, then they're going to have to believe us.

&#x200B;

>And let me just say, there is absolutely nothing wrong with identifying as a soft boy. I don't care what age you are. It doesn't actually mean a little boy. And yes it is feminine. Which there's nothing wrong with. There are a lot of trans men out there who are feminine. I'm among them. I like shoes. I like sparkles. I like stuffed animals. I like cute animals. I like adorable things. I cry when I'm happy. And I think skirts make my legs look amazing.

As per my post, I never said there was anything wrong with this.

&#x200B;

> I'm still a f\*\*\*\*\*\* man. But I'm also a soft boy. 

I have a problem specifically with the idea of people who are clearly adult men calling themselves a soft boy and infantilizing themself. 

&#x200B;

>This is for all you soft boys out there who are tired of this b\*\*\*\*\*\*\* attempt to censor us, just because they have a personal problem within themselves they refuse to work on. 

You're referring to me, right? What is my personal problem that I refuse to work on? Do you think you should be speculating like this when you don't even know me?

&#x200B;

>These judgmental people, their opinions are just that. Their opinions. They do not get to Define who you are or what rights you're allowed to have as a trans man. You do you. That is all you have to worry about. Be authentically yourself. There will be people like this original poster, who will judge you and try to silence you and shame you for simply existing as yourself. But there are just as many people out there who will see you doing you, and go ""hey I like that. I like that person. I like their Style. I'm going to validate them and let them know that who they are is cool with me."" So ignore these a holes. And surround yourself with people who get you, or even if they don't quite get you, people who accept you and understand that you are who you are and you're not going to change just because it makes them uncomfortable. Love yourself Above All Else. You are perfect as you are. And your identity is valid.

My question to those people would be ""why?"" Why put chemicals in your body and alter it so dramatically even if that's not your gender identity?

Sure people \*can\* transition and present how they want, but that doesn't mean that's the best decision for them. There's a reason why in a lot of U.S. states require a letter from a therapist in order to get things like top surgery and bottom surgery.
