offmychest,ffgycte,t1_ffgvugd,1579918223.0,That's usually the problem when one of ours is meowing incessantly- the food bowl isn't filled to where she can eat without getting her whiskers in the bowl.

aww,fepahwy,t1_fep9xab,1579315803.0,"She had a few wounds when we adopted her at 4 months old. Humane society said she had them when they found her on the street so she got into some sort of tussle. 

The rest healed fine but that one scarred. We just keep an eye on it to make sure it doesnt change shape and tell her it makes her look tough."

But then we got a camera to watch them while we're out and I said, ""It'll be the Pookie and Bug show!"" and husband commented that Pookie and Bug Bug had a better ring to it and now she's Bug Bug. Collectively, they are my ""Bubs"" or ""Bubbas""."
relationship_advice,fdjc6ji,t1_fdjbu0l,1578464943.0,"Then I would say she isn't respecting your role in her life and you need to find out why. With what you've posted and your comment regarding your sex life, it sounds to me as if she doesn't see herself in a relationship with you. I would try having another talk, lay it on the line and ask her if she's in this relationship or not."

My husband does this and it's seriously annoying. I tend to get the same thing, like your bf, and really, if you want it, just order it. You get extra AH points for saying you don't order it because you know you can have his."

AskReddit,fckfgij,t3_ehg5ac,1577724142.0,"When I was about 18, I'd gone to Kmart with my mother. We argued in the car, so when she got out and started walking to the store, I lingered well behind her. As I was walking, I saw a man walking towards the store, not too far behind her.

As we were checking out, we found out some man had knocked a woman on her head and stole her purse."
