politics,ffucjbd,t1_ffuamk1,1580239102.0,"I’m not a Steyer voter lol I didn’t say it makes him more credible than other candidates. I’m saying you can trust more reliably that he cares about the environment because he’s seen the effects of fossil fuels and understands the industry and how to combat it. I believe him when he says it’s his number one issue. I have a lot of respect for him realizing his mistakes and doing everything he can to correct them. That being said, I’m in the Bernie camp"
science,ffu4o5z,t3_ev4t6h,1580234416.0,"My grandparents’ dog died when they were in their late 70’s/early 80’s and shortly after my grandpa was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.
They’ve always been dog people and so I remember thinking that if they didn’t buy a new dog it would feel like they were sort of giving up. 
Thankfully a few years later they’re still doing well and have a little doggo running around to keep them company. I think my grandpa’s decline with his disease has definitely been mitigated to some extent by having a dog."
politics,ffu2sv5,t1_ffu0d3r,1580233269.0,"He WAS part of the problem, and has since realized that fact. I would argue that makes him MORE credible to speak on the dangers of climate change and fossil fuels. He literally signed a pledge to give away his entire fortune before he dies, and he’s trying to fix mistakes he made earlier in his life. Why should we discredit his passion and activism because of Past mistakes ?"

UnethicalLifeProTips,fenhb6u,t3_eptagr,1579284681.0,"Or have a little humility and politely ask them for their name again. Think about when you meet someone else and they have to ask your name again, are you horribly offended? No. It isn’t a big deal. This one is dumb"

facepalm,fehvop2,t1_fehtry2,1579124797.0,"Part of the accords was a commitment to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, so I’m not sure what you’re referring to."
facepalm,fehpgxa,t1_fehn7z4,1579121261.0,"It was not 100 billion dollars per country, but 100 billion a year between the richer signatory countries to be spent in developing nations. The U.S. under Obama pledged about 3 billion, for example. Personally I think the U.S. should be putting 100 billion (or a number of similar scale) towards climate change, but that’s not what the Paris Accords asked. It is supposed to be a gradually increasing total per year from multiple nations

Edit: here is a link to an article that clears that up

facepalm,fehngcj,t1_fehcjrp,1579120098.0,"I agree. Renewables are actually cheaper and more efficient if we had a coordinated effort behind it. A massive government subsidy bill that overhauls the sector is one such idea, if only the current fossil fuel energy/oil and gas industries didn’t have their teeth so deep in politics and modern way of life. Like you said, we need to perfect it before scaling it. I’m not saying it isn’t hard to head in that direction, I’m just saying the challenge shouldn’t deter us from trying. If we could get people to run their car on algal biofuel, it would be much cheaper and cleaner. The problem is that no car runs in algal biofuel (yet) haha"

facepalm,feh6q82,t1_feh68uj,1579110299.0,"There was a newspaper article from the late 1800’s IIRC floating around the web a couple months ago. Even back then, people were suggesting a link between climate and factory pollution. It’s not some
grand conspiracy"
facepalm,feh6jeo,t1_feh6407,1579110185.0,"I disagree. Renewable energy is the only path forward, and there are millions of jobs and billions of dollars waiting to be had in that industry. As for the US going it alone, recall that we are the only nation NOT to sign the Paris climate accords per the Donald. We aren’t leading the way, we are lagging behind."

facepalm,feh5h05,t1_fegenf1,1579109543.0,"I mean, define “near future”. 
If we aren’t net zero carbon and methane by 2050 we’re fucked. 
If global warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius (it’s nearing 1.5 rn), we are fucked. 
90% of the world’s coral reefs are fucked anyways within the next couple decades, drastically altering the ocean’s ecosystem (more than a quarter of all marine species live in the reefs).
Arctic glaciers will be completely melted in the summer starting within the next 15 years, and melting permafrost will lead to higher sea levels that displace enormous populations all within the next few decades. It is within the life span of my generation for sure, if not sooner. 
I consider that near future!"

It’s not just about being practical and respectful of other people, it’s one of those little things that teaches discipline! Won’t find too many massive dudes leaving their dumbbells laying all over"
AskReddit,fdwuwb8,t3_en9xmw,1578762538.0,Quora- if that counts as social media. It used to be cool and informative but gradually it has turned into people’s incredibly fake sex stories and clickbaity pictures of scantily clad women for upvotes when it has zero relevance to the topic.
