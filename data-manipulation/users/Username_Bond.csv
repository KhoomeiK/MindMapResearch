I don't get into fantasy world where I got stunned by attractive girls and think they're perfect angles anymore.    I think it's because porn boosted my lust too much so I see those girls as an object not as a person. I'm less horny now and maybe this is what it should be without getting stimulated by porn. I'm not sure but I think it's is."
nosurf,fdgn6wq,t1_fdgm43s,1578402905.0,"Seems like loneliness. Here's the quote from Carl Jung - ""Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself"".

nosurf,fdgi2gs,t3_el9zjl,1578397707.0,"Get used to it is the way for me. Social media makes us lonely because it is connection stimulator to let we feel like we're connected to others, but as we spent time on it very much the less urge of feeling connected we crave. So after quitting the apps, the loneliness of not getting same amount of feeling connected increases."

infp,fd2kcsu,t3_eju25m,1578148466.0,Why most video on Reddit is muted.
nosurf,fczd0ks,t3_ejmi5i,1578098465.0,It's true but it depends on user. Most people are mindless on internet and this is accurate for them. Users just need to be more selective about what they will let it into their lives.

NoFap,fcnbzzz,t1_fcn93jb,1577808411.0,"Yes. It's simple. You used to get something that makes your brain happy and when you don't get it anymore, the brain start to get depressed because the same amount of happiness went down."
NoFap,fcn8d21,t3_ei14oc,1577805905.0,Netflix basically contain lots of nudity and short sex scene. I think it attract audience by this way which is kinda too much.

NoFap,fcn4ta7,t1_fclbqh8,1577803279.0,Cheese. Man. I'm 100% Related. It's weird. I think it's because we realize we aren't horny all the time and we stopped objectifying women.

You should try to find someone you can trust and tell them what's inside, it doesn't have to be girlfriend only, it can be friends, elders, pets. I hope you find that one.  And loneliness will fade away!"
nosurf,fdglu2t,t1_fdgl5mw,1578401662.0,"You don't have to completely quit it, just decrease the average time spent to break the addiction. And you can do a lot of things without girlfriend. You don't have to wait for a great girlfriend to make your life better, you can do it now."
nosurf,fdgla76,t1_fdgkxoy,1578401135.0,Exactly! It looks like everything because it is an addiction. Let's find some good interests.
nosurf,fdgl45e,t1_fdgkxs2,1578400972.0,Yeah. Use it with plan/purpose.
nosurf,fdgl2x4,t1_fdgfkxh,1578400939.0,Great!
nosurf,fdgi2gs,t3_el9zjl,1578397707.0,"Get used to it is the way for me. Social media makes us lonely because it is connection stimulator to let we feel like we're connected to others, but as we spent time on it very much the less urge of feeling connected we crave. So after quitting the apps, the loneliness of not getting same amount of feeling connected increases."
nosurf,fdgcjfg,t3_el1uh1,1578390145.0,Same
mbti,fdg9uvi,t3_el5761,1578386323.0,Entj look so cool

nosurf,fda605n,t3_ekbhym,1578242175.0,"Yeah. News, fun fact and etc. can kill a boredom, that's why we addicted to it like cartoon books. But the internet contain it too much and we spent time on it too much also. It's overstimulation. It's true that we don't need to know it that much."
NoFap,fd75p4e,t1_fd74j5l,1578199765.0,Let's chat
NoFap,fd71bqm,t1_fd70pk3,1578198235.0,Okay. I'll do that. Hope the urges come back haha.
NoFap,fd70dwh,t1_fd6z7s7,1578197933.0,Flatline must be gone after relapse but this time it's not. Is it possible to have flatline after relapse?

infp,fd2kcsu,t3_eju25m,1578148466.0,Why most video on Reddit is muted.
nosurf,fczd0ks,t3_ejmi5i,1578098465.0,It's true but it depends on user. Most people are mindless on internet and this is accurate for them. Users just need to be more selective about what they will let it into their lives.
MbtiTypeMe,fcza4qy,t3_ejga3z,1578096763.0,Simple person
socialanxiety,fcxa79u,t3_ej9svi,1578057100.0,"Hey. I just wanted to give you an advice but it's okay if you aren't interested. What I would suggest to make you look better are 1) Pick your haircut, man. Get the haircut you like. 2) You glasses is way too BIG, there's a lot of glasses frames that would fit you! 3) Your beard might not grown much so how about trim it to short beard style?"

NoFap,fcpjqs5,t1_fcpibzr,1577865902.0,"Why? They're actresses, models, singers things like that."
NoFap,fcnbzzz,t1_fcn93jb,1577808411.0,"Yes. It's simple. You used to get something that makes your brain happy and when you don't get it anymore, the brain start to get depressed because the same amount of happiness went down."
NoFap,fcn8d21,t3_ei14oc,1577805905.0,Netflix basically contain lots of nudity and short sex scene. I think it attract audience by this way which is kinda too much.
NoFap,fcn7vze,t3_ei3uva,1577805562.0,"I feel you. It starts feeling like that on day 10 for me every time. I think it's sign of incoming flatline. I've failed many times because I don't have enough courage enough to experience the flatline. I've never thought this, brain change because of nofap, was real, but IT IS."

NoFap,fcn4z2j,t3_ehszal,1577803403.0,True. One thing I recently realized.
NoFap,fcn4ta7,t1_fclbqh8,1577803279.0,Cheese. Man. I'm 100% Related. It's weird. I think it's because we realize we aren't horny all the time and we stopped objectifying women.

NoFap,fcbo1ty,t3_egv9rm,1577589061.0,"I feel that way too. When you're on nofap you know that they are strangers to each other and having sex. Because when we remove porn from our brains, we will feel like it's not what we wanted, we start to seek more connection in who we want to have sex with."
infp,fcbmzao,t3_egy8j8,1577588722.0,"Look girly to me haha. I'm male. I like philosophy and spiritual stuff also. I like how female infp represents girly pastel, I wish you are as lively as the colour tone."
introvert,fcblud6,t3_egw0qy,1577588355.0,"Totally yes. After sensory overload and trying to be  a bit social in school, I just want to stay only in my quiet room for hours or else I'll get impolite to my family."
MbtiTypeMe,fcbl2p1,t3_egwyqq,1577588114.0,You're totally intuitive. ESFP won't interested in things like that. And ESFP is one of the most extroverted types.
mbti,fcbk0w3,t1_fc77mxf,1577587768.0,"How to determine? For me, immoral people is basically the people who destroy other people's peace. You can see all the laws are based on this also."

NoFap,fc8iuy6,t1_fc8434z,1577535855.0,"Thanks for information and advice. Everyone all say it will definitely go away, but man, I used to have sort of ED back then, not from porn but it was side effect from medication I used. I just recovered. So when flatline say hi to me, I'm scared of being like that again. 

So do you think I can use the supplements I used to treat ED when flatline comes?"

But at first I tried to be nice, very nice, then they acted so rude to me just to make fun or fade away because I'm a boring nice guy. People are selfish, they are easily to think someone not like them even they pushed that someone by themselves."
