churning,ff3kuf9,t1_ff21sdl,1579543191.0,"My thing is I fly fairly often for work/pleasure but never quite enough to get status on the same airline. Also, I am quite tall so paying for upgraded seating gets expensive, especially for long flights when I need it most. If it was AmEx Plat Plus that came with 2nd highest status level on Delta plus everything else AmEx Plat does for $1k/yr, I would do that."

cincinnati,feitxoj,t1_feia7bs,1579147124.0,Shouldn't they pull you over for distracted or reckless driving if your phone usage is causing concern? Why does it need to be it's own thing? I know eating or drinking can be just as bad.
cincinnati,fe9j8ix,t1_fe54q15,1578938034.0,It's also hard to compare because the measurement at one location is rarely indicative of the broader area. And depending on when the official measurement location has moved could also impact it. I'm not saying it's true/false but that the data is messy to work with.
coolguides,fe21mxo,t1_fe1r5vb,1578833497.0,"I don't know about kill you, but keep in mind food safety for warm storage is a minimum of 130 degrees which will burn your hands very quickly. 165 degrees is commonly referenced for killing food borne bacteria in meats so if you washed your water at that temperature everything would die off and your hands would melt off. So ya, washing by hand relies on the chemicals not the temperature."

technology,fdret6s,t1_fdraws2,1578683579.0,"I'm with you mostly except that brokers might be good to regulate but not make illegal. With how big the US is, how could you manually search every county court docket or property search to background check companies or settle estates. I'm generally libertarian but would support legislation confirming that brokers that provide aggregated information to people who don't have a legitimate need could be held liable for improper usage of that information. Would just need to get some definitions around need and usage, but looking up an old friend/partner definitely isn't it."

MadeMeSmile,fdoiqfx,t1_fdoh5kh,1578605961.0,"It's in certain markets, subjects, and grade levels. One thing that changed recently in Denver is a school district did away with their union to be able to more competitively go after teachers in hard to fill subjects and be more flexible with each opening. No idea how it turned out objectively, it was very heated, but it was an attempt to align pay with competition."
MadeMeSmile,fdocxrg,t1_fdo4cqt,1578602878.0,"I wouldn't generally include police, as many are paid well and get retirement benefits well above private industry norms. But in addition to other responses, a jobs pay is often related directly to how hard it is to fill. Kindergarten teacher openings get dozens of applicants. Firefighter openings (especially in major cities) are often highly sought after. Oil field workers get bank because that's the only way to get people out there."
sysadmin,fdnvwn2,t1_fdnqlyo,1578593919.0,Why wouldn't it be? There's no expectation of privacy. The IT team would probably have to be restricted from trading in company stock but other than SEC concerns what law would it break?
dogswithjobs,fdls24s,t1_fdlfia8,1578531144.0,"Most aren't deadly. Predators don't want a fight, so a big dog that makes lots of noise and gets in their way is enough incentive for most to move on to the next feeding area."

cincinnati,fdif1pv,t3_elju7t,1578441437.0,"Miami Township did contract a supply agreement for electric, but not gas. We got well more than 7 days notice and it was clear what the rate would be with ready opt out options. It requires active agreement on someone's part to agree to any changes, so either your local government voted to do it and this is your notice or it's a pushy tactic trying to get you to actually sign up. The utility suppliers out here are vicious with their lies to try and get you to sign up.

Example, I had a gas supplier come to a prior house closing to be from Duke and asking to see my latest utility bill. I had a no solicitation sign and pointed to it and he said ""I'm not soliciting, just sharing information"" but tried to get me to sign up for a new supplier."
technology,fdidw2k,t1_fdhojk2,1578440687.0,"The question comes down to what is your risk working for the company, versus the people who invested initial capital to pay you while the product made no money for the company. Employer/employee relationships are generally strictly contractual. Work X time for Y money. You get performance bonuses and maybe some profit sharing, and the company pays you regularly. Or you get equity and irregular pay to share the risk of development. Employees and investors have very different relationships with companies and different risk/reward scenarios."
LifeProTips,fdfugz2,t1_fdfj3zd,1578370529.0,Some jobs in accounting or finance require >1 week off at least once a year so other people have a chance to do your work to minimize fraud.
NoStupidQuestions,fd9taec,t1_fd9plyd,1578237759.0,"Often is not an explicit secret, but many competitors find their own ways of doing things. Wendy's doesn't want to make a McDonald's hamburger, and Burger King uses different cooking methods on purpose. Copying a famous recipe is basically admitting they are better than you can come up with. Then you also have to match the logistics and supply chain management if you want to compete."

Futurology,fcqr0sp,t1_fcp8ccp,1577890841.0,"From what I recall, Greenpeace has been the big pusher of this concept. It's also prevalent in the EU so European farmers don't get to use any/many GM crops either."

Edit: I was curious about each bank so going through some of the largest ones, only Chase and Bank of America post High to Low if there is no time associated with the transaction. All major banks are deposits first, then chronological, then mostly low to high (Wells, Citi, US Bank, and Regions). Based on each banks posted checking account agreement."
