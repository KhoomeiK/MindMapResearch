PoliticalHumor,fh6mgce,t1_fh5g21w,1581301455.0,"Trump BARELY won the electoral last time against a pretty hated opponent Hillary. In 2012 with the entire Republican party base terrified of Obama and turning out, Obama still won by nearly double the electoral votes of Trump's ""big"" win.

I think Democrats just have to not pick Hillary and fucking show up to vote."

WTF,fglzfpg,t1_fglz0un,1580914671.0,The root system is where trees inject their heroine and cut their cocaine with razorblades. It's why tree roots are full of used needless and razorblades. The rhizosphere is a crazy place.

IllinoisWax,fgcpgy0,t1_fgcnwbg,1580675064.0,"I think just consistency because both use fresh plant material that's frozen to trap water during extraction. It's got that sexy orange terpy glow.

I like the consistency better with the budder"
IllinoisWax,fgckhc3,t3_exsuro,1580673478.0,"Man, hit me in the face with wonderful fruity notes as soon as I opened it. Feels like a summer day, and the budder consistency is easy to work with.

Edit: A few hours and another puff later, this is truly a standout in my opinion. Phenomenal flavors and a smell that just reaches right up and twinges your nose the instant you open it. Great feel that really brings the best of a hybrid. So damn terpy with that live extraction and using fresh buds."
