By ""ok time"" I meant that the animal should be comfortable, calm, and not pained or in distress. Was my phrasing bad?

An animal can be impacted by a negative interaction more than 30 minutes past the event. Some animals can quite literally die of fright, and sloths in particular are averse to oils on human skin - so one sloth hugging photo will cause lingering damage to the sloth. 

Wild animals are not meant to interact with humans. To cause intentional harm and distress to an animal for the purpose of a ""selfie"", or just for the purpose of touching and handling something we find visually pleasing, is pretty irresponsible and narcissistic."

aww,feuuwzb,t1_fetuyrl,1579390204.0,"It's partly to do with how our brains are wired - we are programmed to see faces where there are none, for instance.

But the cool thing about humans is that we are capable of self-evaluation and checking our behaviors. So when we see animal pictures and videos that we think are cute, we need to double-check ourselves and make sure we know if the animal is really having an ok time."
aww,feuuh94,t1_fetzson,1579390049.0,"Dogs and cats were domesticated through *thousands* of years living near humans and having mutually beneficial relationships with humans (cats ate rodents near human food stores, dogs hunted with humans, etc.) Cats' inner biology actually changed as a result of living with humans! But even feral cats display a fear of humans still. ""This human is ok"" is not something hard-programmed into cat brains. Not sure about dogs, feral dogs aren't as much of a thing.

Some animals can become *accustomed* to humans in specific circumstances, like when the animal is orphaned and raised by humans. This is why the illegal pet trade will slaughter mother animals to steal the babies. But this is not domestication, it's more like Stockholm Syndrome. Domestication involves many, many generations.

Other animals aside, I know that sloths are always, always stressed out by humans if they are forced to perform unnatural behaviors - plus human skin contains harmful oils that will interfere with the sloth's hair's natural bacteria. Sloths are not meant to interact with humans."

Fear can have a much greater effect on animals than in humans. Fear is more likely to mean a direct incoming threat to the animal's life. They can die of anxiety or develop problems from high stress levels and raised blood pressure.

Not to mention that this sort of photo encourages others to re-create it, which in turn helps out the ""animal selfie"" industry - an industry which almost always entails animals being abused, neglected, and in some cases killed to harvest their babies."
