fatlogic,fen3jdy,t3_ep4l2t,1579276179.0,Those things can be great....but a lot of people (moi included) have really messed up signals.
fatlogic,fen37ob,t3_eq1ksj,1579275970.0,"Someone on Twitter said losing weight never leads to health....I had to refute that shit as someone who by losing weight improved her blood pressure, overall quality of life,  and sleep. Not to mention reducing the incidence of knee pain that I get from an old injury. I regained some weight and right now my knees hate me so fucking much. Even stairs can be a struggle and I live on the second floor of my building."
trueloseit,fe8215j,t3_eo0pe9,1578921549.0,Pure CICO has worked for me. That's just calorie counting and exercise. I use a site called SparkPeople which gives you a range instead of one calorie number to stay under (which helps me to stay fairly sane with the whole thing). The community there can also be terrific.
fatlogic,fdqdnm7,t1_fdn7sm9,1578663908.0,That's me too. I consider it to be like my bank account. I just can't overdraw.
fatlogic,fdn5dmc,t1_fdkb17k,1578577748.0,I get the feels....people do get used to a person at one weight and then freak when they go way below. As someone who went from the high 170s (obese) to the low 120s (almost a healthy BMI...I am very short) I had that.
fatlogic,fdn56fm,t3_em5j5q,1578577589.0,"As much as I'd like to believe the 80s were 20 years ago....that was more like 40 years ago, I know because I'm almost 40."
bipolar,fb46xnh,t1_fb0u5tw,1576502916.0,I've been on all but the Effexor. I'm still on Lamictal.
