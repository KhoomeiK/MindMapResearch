True, GRRM can be blamed for agreeing to a television show and then not stepping up to provide a functional ending; not finishing the books in time is merely poor planning and I've been the victim of that myself, but he apparently provided little or no guidance later on. GRRM does have an unbecoming attitude over the whole ordeal and I'll fault him for that. 

That said, D&D were the sort of people adding shit just because they thought it looked cool. (Seriously.) They also could've outsourced the writing of the overarching plot, as opposed to sticking with just doing whatever. Besides, GRRM got less involved once they decided to cut out Lady Stoneheart over his protests, meaning they decided to depart from the source material earlier than was strictly necessary. 

GRRM not providing a decent ending was also indirectly D&D's fault, but I'm not sure whether there were other factors at play.

Neuh. Iets met schootvoetend kernenergie accepteren... All caps? Sjong. 

Beide pogingen, zowel hernieuwbare als kernenergie, zouden vermoedelijk falen of in ieder geval niet het doel halen waar wij op hopen. Immers, mensen. Het falen van één van die takken der sport zou echter minder onvoorspelbare problemen met zich mee brengen. 

> hebben we alle tijd om het op te lossen

Famous last words, maar ik gun je je optimisme. 

Zelf vrees ik dat de ontwrichting van de wereldeconomie als gevolg van klimaatverandering wellicht roet in het eten gaat gooien. Ineens zal iets dat nu al heel duur is (en waarbij, zoals ik zei, al een enorme achterstand van betaling bestaat) volkomen onbetaalbaar worden. 
Wanneer meer hernieuwbare energiebronnen creëeren tevens onbetaalbaar wordt behoudt je alle eerder gebouwde bronnen zonder dat er verdere grootschalige investeringen nodig zijn. Die hernieuwbare bronnen zijn n.b. relatief-gezien gedencentraliseerd, lokaal, zelfstandig en minder kwetsbaar. Als (=zodra) het schip strandt met kernenergie ben je verder van huis. 

Misschien kunnen we het eens zijn over dat er een enorme (echt een ronduit schokkende) investering nodig is voor verantwoorde energieopwekking, hoe die ook toegepast gaat worden. Een focus zou daarin prettig zijn, waarbij ik een focus op kernenergie sceptisch zou accepteren."

> In een bunker bewaren is een goede oplossing voor de komende 100 jaar. Een gat graven van 2 km diepte valt redelijk mee qua kosten. En ja er zijn wereldweid voldoende plekken om zulke projecten op te zetten.

Het project duurt echter dertig jaar en kost minstens een miljard aanvankelijk. Ik zeg overigens niet dat het onmogelijk is om afval op te slaan, ik zeg dat de wil/winst er niet is. Waar zijn nu dan al die permanente opslagplaatsen; er wordt toch al vrij lang kernenergie gebruikt? Hebben mensen niet tijdig rekening gehouden met de opslag van kernafval?! Onmogelijk.... /s  

> In een bunker bewaren is een goede oplossing voor de komende 100 jaar.

Ik mag hopen dat dergelijke projecten voor **aanzienlijk** langere termijnen ontworpen worden. 100 jaar is totale onzin; het project in Finland (n.b. gefinancieerd en verplicht d.m.v. wetgeving) kostte al dertig jaar, en gaat nog enkele jaren in beslag nemen. Het wordt juist gebouwd om de komende honderd jaar als ontvangende opslagplaats te dienen, waarna het spul de tienduizenden jaren daarna hopelijk ongestoord kan doorbrengen.

> Nuclear afval is geen probleem. 

Ehm, ik vraag mij echt af welke informatie jij aan het lezen bent. Ik heb totaal geen moeite met problemen vinden via een zoekmachine, jij blijkbaar wel. Er zijn talloze artikelen over de huidige opslagsituatie en geen enkele is er over te spreken.

Ik beloof dat ik 100% zal erkennen dat nucleair afval geen probleem is, dat mensen kunnen omgaan met de langdurige opslag van nucleair afval (ook nadat de schaal massaal vergroot wordt om aan de behoefte te voldoen) zodra jij aantoont dat men dat nu al doet."
thenetherlands,fe4r3d3,t1_fe2co3u,1578861982.0,"Ik snap de gedachtengang en volgens mij zijn we het in de kern (heh) eens, maar wat ik vaak zie is dat kernenergie voorstanders er vanuit gaan van dat de status quo (m.b.t verbruik, economische omstandigheden, geopolitiek, etc.) gehandhaafd wordt en dan ziet kernenergie er zeker beter uit dan fossiele brandstoffen. Ik heb echter grote twijfels over een implementatie van een kernenergie transitie en de gevolgen van een halfslachtige transitie.

Als we er vanuit gaan dat de economie geteisterd wordt door de gevolgen van klimaatverandering binnen twee decennia lijkt het mij moeilijk om nog miljarden te investeren in de kwalitatief-hoogstaande opslag van kernafval - hoewel de kerncentrales wellicht wel op tijd uit de grond gestampt kunnen worden baart de fase daarna mij zorgen. Defecte zonnepanelen vereisen geen betonnen bunkers diep in de aardkorst. 

Vermoedelijk zal geen enkele transitie (naar hernieuwbaar, kernenergie of naar beide) werkelijk op constructieve wijze van de grond komen of überhaupt tijdig effect hebben, tenminste niet zonder dat alle mensen ter wereld daarnaast een drastische heroverweging maken rondom hun levensstijl en de handen vervolgens ineen slaan.

In most legal systems and in ethics the answer would be no, as nobody should love in poverty and they are obviously not able to make a reasoned decision. Then again, most legal systems also allow these nitwits a (similarly unreasoned) vote, which leads to the aforementioned situation. Ethically speaking, it may be justified to stop the effects of their idiocy in order to make sure they can be taken care of in old age, but we all know that limiting suffrage isn't a great idea either.

Ja, goed voorbeeld om te volgen. Zal echter decennia duren voor die mogelijkheden in Nederland zijn geïntroduceerd en tegen die tijd zouden we al over moeten zijn gegaan op 100% renewables.  

> 3. In finland is een enorm diepe mijn gegraven om afval op te bergen,

In Finland *wordt* een 'mijn' gegraven om nucleair afval op te bergen. Het project duurde decennia en is natuurlijk ontzettend duur. Zal wederom decennia duren voordat Nederland diens eigen nucleaire afval kan opbergen - de opslagplek in Finland is een besloten affaire. Goed voorbeeld, maar er gaan nog 1000 van dergelijke projecten overal ter wereld nodig zijn en ik zie de politieke wil niet bestaan, jij wel?

> 4. De schade die tot nu toe door kern afval aan de natuur is gedaan valt reuze mee.

Interessante woordkeuze. Ja, *tot nu toe* met een beperkte hoeveelheid valt het mee, maar één rondje googlen zal je informeren over de vele gevallen waarbij het totaal niet goed gegaan is en waarbij niemand bereidt lijkt om de investeringen te doen die noodzakelijk zijn om de bende op te ruimen. Daarnaast hebben we het dan nog helemaal niet over de noodzakelijke schaalvergroting. Valt het probleem relatief gezien mee, tot nu toe? Ja, CO2 uitstoot is een groter probleem. Zitten we in de buurt van definitieve oplossingen en de wil om eerdere oepsies op te lossen? Totaal niet. Er zit geen geld in verantwoorde opslag en het opruimen van eerdere fouten.  

De mateloze positiviteit rondom nucleair afval wrijft mij enorm tegen de haren in. Waar kun je die oogkleppen die nodig zijn om te denken dat alles nu wel OK geregeld is kopen? Ik ben geïnteresseerd."

> - Het afvalprobleem van een kernreactor minder groot is dan het vrijlaten van CO2 (dat is echt VEEL duurder om op te slaan als je het eerst weer uit de atmosfeer moet terugwinnen)

Het afvalprobleem kan snel volledig uit de klauwen lopen als de transitie naar groen niet snel genoeg vordert, want dat dreigt het nu al te doen. Tot nu toe is de mensheid er niet in geslaagd om op een 100% verantwoorde wijze een aanzienlijk deel van het nucleaire afval op te slaan. Het feit dat bestaande probleem plekken niet aangepakt worden baart mij zorgen, nog los van de dry-cask velden en het overig nucleair afval dat een #foreverhome zoekt. Er is simpelweg geen oplossing momenteel.  

Ik zou kernenergie schoorvoetend als tijdelijke oplossing accepteren, maar de politieke en (vooral) de afvalverwerking problematiek vind ik ernstig. Het komt op mij over als met een oplossing voor één probleem een heel ander probleem maken."
