Whatcouldgowrong,feru5g5,t1_feq11j3,1579358371.0,My great grandpa built a full sized ship from stolen parts (taken from his job at the shipyard) in his backyard. Was bigger than the house and could be seen from the street. No idea how they got it out but he ended up using it to quit his job and be a commercial fisherman.
RealEstate,fepjf13,t3_eq9o8i,1579322044.0,"People say it‚Äôs great for kids. No it‚Äôs a fucking nightmare. Welcome to your child having full access to four rooms (dining, kitchen, living, sitting) and you can‚Äôt do anything about it unless you put up twenty gates. 

Also your house never ever feels clean. You‚Äôll always be looking at that pile of dirty dishes when you‚Äôd rather be winding down watching tv. 

We are moving to a 1950s home and I love all the doors! I can‚Äôt wait to just be able to shut a damn door!

Edit: After reading everyone‚Äôs answers I think it stems from FOMO. Everyone wants to be doing everything all at once. We can‚Äôt just be cooking, we need to be cooking AND watching tv. I have high anxiety and have focused a lot on mindfulness so I hate it. I don‚Äôt want to be doing/seeing everything at once."

wholesomememes,feng9h7,t3_eq0vt7,1579284036.0,As a mom this happens to me so much that I just pretend I don‚Äôt see you doing it because the amount you have to interact with others in public when you have a baby is EXHAUSTING.

trashy,fegrzfv,t3_eoxtfb,1579101164.0,"I‚Äôm on dog free even though I own a dog. This one is an extreme example and there are people that are kind of nuts. Mostly it‚Äôs a good place to feel validated about your dislike of dogs being okay. Right now I‚Äôm forced to share a space with an aggressive pit bull who snarled at my infant daughter and has bit twice despite being raised in an extremely loving household.

It just sucks that society makes me feel like a dog is more valuable than a child‚Äôs safety. The dog will live at most four more years in its current health. My daughter could live to be 90 and live with scars on her face or body. I asked the vet what to do and she didn‚Äôt suggest euthanasia which we were kind of hoping for (dog is very very sick and we have done A LOT to help her and she is getting mean because of it). 

The other day my daughter was playing with my in laws chickens when a pit bull came out of no where and tried ripping my in laws dog to shreds. Then bit my MIL, within twenty seconds this dog had caused so much damage. I had to run holding my daughter hoping this dog wasn‚Äôt going to start chasing us. The owners said the dog has never acted like this. This dog didn‚Äôt give warning, it just bolted. It‚Äôs like a family leaving a loaded gun on the table. 

I‚Äôm on dog free because I‚Äôm tired of us having to pretend that large aggressive dogs are compatible with living in places with children. In case anyone‚Äôs wondering, I have ten more days until we move and my husbands dog will be staying with my parents.

Idk, mostly just stating why some of us are on dogfree."

Parenting,fedq8p9,t1_fedaz01,1579017535.0,"I like to do stuff, like most adults lol. And infancy drove me nuts because she just wanted to lay down and be held and my mind is just too active for that. 

The huge improvements I can remember were: laughing like huge belly laugh, crawling, walking, and following directions. If I stick my hand out and she has a piece of shmutz she will come give it to me or if I tell her to get her hands out of the toilet she‚Äôll stop. Even better we can dance to songs together like ‚Äúif you‚Äôre happy and you know it‚Äù. It makes you feel more in control to know they understand you. It makes it feel more like you‚Äôre interacting with someone rather than just being bossed around by a blob all day. At least for me.

dogs,fdrr4d0,t1_fdrnpfw,1578688402.0,"One was an intruder. Completely justified. The other was an unfamiliar guest from a foreign country who thought he should touch her neck to establish ‚Äúdominance‚Äù. It was a bad move but I think her biting him was excessive reaction. This happened when she first started having health issues and her neck was an area of pain.

Her aggression seems to be health related."
dogs,fdrfk9e,t1_fdreb0u,1578683811.0,"The dog is in a lot of pain from health issues that almost make me wonder if euthanasia isn‚Äôt the more humane option. The growling incident occurred when the baby touched the dogs hip. Which normally never happens but my parents weren‚Äôt paying attention and had gotten too comfortable with them interacting. The hip off and on has caused her pain. The skin condition makes her itch until she bleeds regardless of what we do. We are at the vet every week at this point. Which causes her a lot of stress. The cytopoint injection has made it from unbearable pain and constant whining to regular uncomfortable itching. But vet says this is temporary fix. We are doing immunology shots now that the vet says may or may not work.

And I don‚Äôt know how rehoming her with already having health issues that cause a low quality of life wouldn‚Äôt push her to becoming extremely aggressive and hurting her new owners. 

It‚Äôs a difficult situation I guess, especially now that the baby kind of puts an urgency on it."
dogs,fdre3va,t1_fdrbxtj,1578683161.0,We have a series of gates and after this incident they aren‚Äôt going to be around each other anymore.

But thank you I really needed to hear that because it‚Äôs what my instinct tells me but my husband is too attached to the dog and not present when the behaviors occur to really see this.
dogs,fdraizr,t1_fdr9nz8,1578681696.0,"Do you know anything about what that process is like? Going through a rescue I mean. Emotionally for my husband, I don‚Äôt want to just hand the leash over to strangers .

It‚Äôs to the left of the engine coming right out of the coolant box. If you leaned over the car your belt would touch it.

legaladvice,fdh7qel,t1_fdh6xy2,1578417195.0,"It was for something with the ignition and  that recall too.

It sprays out coolant everywhere so it‚Äôs pretty hard to find the leak.

legaladvice,fdh70ca,t1_fdh4zyv,1578416747.0,"Coolant elbow $300
The coolant hose (the one we are pretty sure they broke in the first place) $300
Fan belt $300 (doesn‚Äôt really make sense but I guess they mean the serpentine belt)

The repairs have not been done and no one has approved them. Waiting on a phone call from corporate to see if they can resolve it but they are very hard to get in touch with. 

$80 doesn‚Äôt seem reasonable when I was lead to believe they were paying for it when I told them my car broke down a mile off the lot. It feels very dishonest."

legaladvice,fdh5ujw,t1_fdh4ql6,1578416026.0,"Do you think they could have damaged it and replaced without putting it on the work order? This is what we thought. I don‚Äôt think it was done maliciously but someone made a mistake and didn‚Äôt put it in the work order. 

As I said though. Either way they‚Äôve clearly caused some kind of damage as the car did not drain all of its coolant when I brought it there and now it does as soon as you start driving. 

I understand it‚Äôs an older car and people are like! Why would you care about an older POS car but it was actually a very good and reliable car following this and we have a one year old baby and are just trying to close on our first house in twenty days and really don‚Äôt need the stress of car repairs that we didn‚Äôt cause."
legaladvice,fdh5gnv,t1_fdgz6xb,1578415790.0,"It‚Äôs a hose and can be accidentally damaged doing other repairs pretty easily it‚Äôs right on top of the car when you open the hood. 

I don‚Äôt think they were doing it to be malicious. I think someone fucked up the hose and replaced it without putting it on the work order because they were lazy or didn‚Äôt want to get in trouble. 

It was very very obviously brand new when you touched it compared to the other hoses in the car. I really don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôd just wipe this hose off either.

Also. The car drove when I brought it there and was well maintained. Didn‚Äôt drive when I took it off the lot, like not even up the street. I think that‚Äôs the biggest piece of evidence they‚Äôve made an error. 

The recalls were not important to the functioning of the vehicle. I didn‚Äôt take it in for the recalls because it wasn‚Äôt driving. Just because I got a letter in the mail telling me it had a recall."

Marriage,fd6sj6l,t3_ejuzmp,1578195176.0,"I really think people are usually talking about parenthood when they say these things. Like parenthood really does tie you to someone for life not marriage. People get divorced all the time and never have to see each other again. If you are parents together, you really are bound to each other for life in one way or another whether you like it or not.

I always find it strange when people are willing to have children with someone they are afraid to commit to. Like being a parent with someone is so much more commitment than being married???

Don‚Äôt agree on the idea that if you get married older you aren‚Äôt going to grow and change. People change constantly as they have new experiences, that never stops."
