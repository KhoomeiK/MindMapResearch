csuf,fdic46m,t1_fdibidy,1578439566.0,Then your chances are looking better and better! Still recommend taking a look at the cpsc handbook. GL!
csuf,fdi6f29,t3_eliiw3,1578436554.0,"First of all, learn how to Google. It will help you find most answers when you're finishing a project last minute and your professor isn't going to be able to email you until it's due anyways. I found the cpsc undergrad handbook on my first search. Page 14 answers your last question. The rest is useful too.

Secondly, if you were sure you were going to fail and got a B, you either didn't talk to your professor at all or didn't keep track of returned assignments and their grades. Do both of these in all your classes in the future!

Lastly, and to answer your first question, cpsc dept waitlists take class standing into account so waitlist position isn't relevant and Idk how many units you have under your belt but I assume not many so your chances are slim unless a lot drop. 

I'd find other classes you can take, cpsc or not, and see availability. Or take them at Fullerton junior college and save some money. All the sciences, and most ge's and cpsc 100 and 200 level equivalents are available at FJC and will cost you a fraction of CSUF. Parking pass was $80 last I checked and I didn't even need one because I took later classes after work."

csuf,fbybp7u,t3_eey4xy,1577212904.0,"Talk to someone about the suicide, lots of free phone lines and resources online. It took me 11 years to get my degree. First two years I fucked up my gpa taking more classes than I could handle and didn't even know what major I might want. I failed out of that college. Hit one of my pivotal bottoms. Started going back to school for something I was interested in. Got the equivalent of an AA in something. Couldn't find work in that field, partly my own apathy partly it is a competitive field. Transitioned to CS. Took final 5 years taking 2-3 classes a semester while working. Gf broke up with me a month before finals. Still finished somewhat strong.

Main points? Even if you chip away a little bit, as long as you're consistent, you can attain a goal. Whether you pick up a hobby and get a job that's related to it, go to a trade school, or stay in college, anything you choose could teach you useful things for a future job or life experience. And there will always be things holding you back or dampening your happiness.

The human mind holds on to negative experiences. Unless you practice active mindfulness and appreciate good things, you will have a negatively skewed world view.

Do your thing. Whatever it is, just keep doing it.

Pm me if you need to talk."
