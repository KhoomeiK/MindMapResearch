Economics,ffhdpzt,t3_etbjqv,1579931103.0,"Alternatively....actually teach in schools how to manage money, open bank accounts and how to wisely use credit cards etc? Nahhh let's keep them uneducated so that they don't know that managing money with credit card cash back rewards etc actually ends up saving you money."
EliteMiners,fffuzow,t1_fff5d63,1579892378.0,"Well all the resources required to get to an asteroid wouldn't happen if investors weren't going to get the gold. The gold will be sold. And investors would probably use that gold to invest further into other projects that will net them even more wealth. Rich people don't really sit on a commodity they constantly invest. If there's one thing we know from rich people is that they will look to keep getting richer. Sitting on gold doesn't do that, using the gold to invest in even more assets or investments would. Why sit on the gold if you could sell it and fund more rockets to go get even more precious metals. 

Think about yourself. When you mine in elite dangerous do you just leave it in your cargo hold and say okay I'm happy with my sidewinder i have zero desire to sell void opals and buy an anaconda. Of course not. We sell it so we can buy even more things. Otherwise I wouldn't have my imperial cutter. Same in real life. Humans are driven to get more and more things.

Call it greed, but desire for more is part of our nature.

And yeah exactly like futures markets we would expect the team who went up to mine an asteroid will sell it. If they return and don't sell it then prices would rise again. 

Also keep in mind elite dangerous ships are one man ships. Irl we can't afford for one individual to go up to mine asteroids it would be large teams of many people and likely with government funding. What we see in elite dangerous is more in a future where we already have been mining for a long long time to make ships affordable by ordinary people. We don't have military doing the job of a truck driver so there white dangerous isn't even very realistic. 

The new system sure has tons of flaws, but it is better than what we had before where if you show up to a station that only demands 10 void opals with a cargo of 400 they would still pay you 1.6 mil for all of it. That's even less realistic.

Obviously this whole thing is speculation since we don't do this in real life."
EliteMiners,fffc4s1,t1_fff84ze,1579880707.0,"Well yeah, and we speculate all the time and what companies will be successful, what games will be, etc. All the hype for Cyberpunk 2077bis speculation. Humans love speculating about the future.

As far as your second points yeah I agree. If it was going to really encompass everything it would also impact ship prices etc."
EliteMiners,fff0wag,t3_et7r9a,1579872607.0,"Yeah I mean to me it makes sense. I'm an economist and it isn't hard to see what they intended with this update. If you have way more in your cargo hold then a station demands then yeah they will drop the price right there because the scarcity of the resource has fallen and it will cost you money to have to leave the station and sell elsewhere giving you an incentive to sell at the current station. 

The exact amount of price changes might be off but as a concept it makes sense.

Same as IRL if we do start mining asteroids then the value of certain metals will fall before the rocket even gets back to earth in anticipation of the material that will become available to us."

personalfinance,ff2c51m,t1_ff29xsu,1579500315.0,That's the crux. If you put interest rate and inflation on a graph together they ended up matching fairly well  like the 70s interest rates were great....but so was inflation so ultimately it still didn't make it a good investment for real return.

At least that's what I tell myself. Kind of like if everyone was a millionaire nobody would be because everything would cost more and that would be the norm. 

I had a while where I didn't even feel happy though. Only thing I can say is if you know that there are good days even if they don't last that can help you stay motivated to try to keep pushing toward what might make you happier.
