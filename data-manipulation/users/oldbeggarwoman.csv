cats,fbz0xs1,t1_fbyzu6w,1577231794.0,I've heard it is best not to put food inside because it attracts other animals that might scare the cat away.  I had a house set up for strays at the back of my house and I fed/watered them by my side door.  The bowls were heated and I kept water in all the time but didn't leave any food out after dusk because it only attracted raccoons.  Three strays stayed with me that winter and I was able to TNR all three.
