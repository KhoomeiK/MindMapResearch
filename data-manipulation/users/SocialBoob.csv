humanrights,fe4cw5p,t1_fe2i5p2,1578857986.0,"No. Actually the opposite. 

I wrote that at some ridiculous lack of sleep hour. Apologies for the incoherent train of thought. 

Essentially what I was trying to say was that Australia and policing is starting to appear like big business. Everyone is going in for the paycheck and not the desire to look after the community.

There is a few reasons for this but the biggest culprit is technology. As it phases out the old, our workforce is being forced to evolve. For example automation in Australia is quite strong I suspect to our laziness which is a national trait and affects our workplace as people go how can I do this more efficiently? 

So police drive not bad but it does attract career changes, bogans and miscreants who are only seeing the paycheck and not the primary responsibility of the police; the protection of the people."

It's time to move on. Find people who appreciate you and love you and most importantly **do not emotionally manipulate you**. There is nothing but heartbreak and disappointment there. 

Parents are supposed to love you, protect you and advocate for you. They are very clearly not doing that and tbh it is typical of abusive relationships."
