gabagoodness,fgje2cg,t1_fgjbl89,1580842100.0,Yeah it's an acquired taste. For me it's reminiscent of a weed high a little bit with zero anxiety though and a little bit of an opiate high with a kind of pleasurable body buzz. Huge mood uplift and energy boost but your body's kind of drunk too so be careful and don't drive or anything like that! Very interesting compound to say the least! My favorite drug!
gabagoodness,fgjagle,t3_eyu7ko,1580840160.0,"Yeah take a little more. You will feel more of that ""weird"" feeling but it should be accompanied by a feeling of well being and euphoria. Did you eat any fat? I find that trick to work as well as sippingn on a sugary fizzy drink."
Benzedrex,fgj9bnj,t1_fggsoyz,1580839544.0,Damn bro is your stim tolerance super high in general or do you normally have odd interactions with substances?
BlowJob,fghtzhc,t3_eyeqsr,1580793812.0,Thanks I love stuff like this.
worldnews,fghpso9,t3_eyd5c4,1580790545.0,Wtf is wrong with people?

depression,fg3ytr5,t1_ffz91oo,1580492571.0,Thank you friend.
depression,ffwbww5,t1_ffuefff,1580294522.0,I'm happy you still have a job! Depression won a couple months back and I lost my job of 11 years do to sleeping through my alarm too many times. My whole world went upside down with a very close scare of homelessness and loss of family. I'm back working and we got help with rent but the depression still lurks. One day at a time.
depression,ffvuror,t3_ev5g5g,1580273854.0,Fuckin' same. Even missed therapy. How sad is that? To depressed to even drive my ass to therapy. It wasn't even like a sad feeling just purely physical. Like having the flu but no coughing or sneezing.
AskReddit,ffufpe0,t3_ev5zdg,1580240989.0,Last week sometime. My PTSD has really been taking a toll and I recently lost a longtime job. Not good especially with a wife and kids to support. Thankfully things are looking up. I got another job and we're getting help with rent and such. Mentally it's still a battle though.
mildlyinteresting,ffkj14a,t3_etzt64,1580023570.0,Wow Billy Idol really needs to lay off the smack.
conspiracy,ffj27l9,t3_etv5pm,1579988538.0,Good shit. THIS is why I subscribed.
conspiracy,ffivb4z,t1_ffiqpum,1579983586.0,You literally can't make this shit up.
OutOfTheLoop,ffhtgwi,t1_ffhehc6,1579953056.0,Fair enough. You have the right to your opinion.
OutOfTheLoop,ffhdvn2,t1_ffgxjpu,1579931272.0,"I think that's the point Rogan is trying to make. Sure it's not good to give a platform to a racist let's say. But just because some people thinks that person is a racist doesn't necessarilly mean it's true, right? We might be outright censoring someone based on perspective when the facts might be totally different. This is coming from a liberal btw."

JoeRogan,ffg77x5,t1_fffp7dk,1579899948.0,"I really miss the ""kick that mule, Lee"" music in the beginning ever since he signed to spotify. The energy is so low at the start of the podcast. You can tell Joey hates it too."
conspiracy,fffy2q7,t1_ffc2q3m,1579894312.0,Oh good. For some reason in my mind he wrote the book before this event took place. I guess that wouldn't make much sense lol
conspiracy,ffb6c9y,t1_ffaejyt,1579752973.0,Aww man and I thought ol' Smedley was a good guy for writing that book. Thanks for shitting on my birthday cake.
AskHR,ff20v55,t1_feymt16,1579490807.0,I kind of doubt I'm fired and I DID try to call them 3 times. I'm going to say I was vomiting with diarrhea since I'm constantly around smashed eggs and bird crap it's been known to happen from time to time. Thanks for the advice all I go back in the a.m. I'll keep you all posted!
AskHR,feug0c7,t1_fetuuyi,1579386151.0,It's nice to know I'm not the only one. I was hoping to not tell them about my mental health issues. I was at my last job for 11 years and when I had a nervous breakdown last year I wound up having to divulge WAY to much personal information about myself and I feel like it put a label on me for the rest of my time there. I'll probably go with the food poisoning excuse.
AskHR,feueif3,t1_fetrr81,1579385765.0,"I actually did but nobody was at the phone I guess. I called again after I made this post but again, nobody answered."

mentalpod,fein4uy,t1_fegnc3r,1579142419.0,I literally just started therapy last Wednesday and I credit MIHH and Last Podcast on the left for the same reasons. I'm very excited to check out that other pod you just mentioned.
mentalpod,feg3y5l,t1_fedpvg7,1579075834.0,Sweet! Thanks!
mentalpod,feg3wtg,t1_feflhnl,1579075787.0,Wow thanks! You all have been so awesome! I recently got diagnosed with ptsd on top of my regular anxiety/depression and this podcast instantly became a part of my life.
mentalpod,fed4pcr,t1_feby5qx,1578998726.0,"What's the name of the guest that they play at the end of every episode that says ""Everbody I know is bizarrely beautiful in a fucked up way""?"
mentalpod,fed4h7k,t1_fecuxgy,1578998395.0,It's what made me fall in love with the pod! Totally unique. Paul Gilmarten is awesome!

LPOTL,fe7hece,t1_fe6t3ep,1578914487.0,I like an ice cold frosty mug of root beer or Pepsi or sometimes a flavored sparkling water to celebrate. Don't forget to roll up a fat hog's leg as well.
LPOTL,fe6r6f8,t1_fe5vbo3,1578901525.0,Hail youselves!

Clearnetmarkets,fdfyu48,t1_fdfyojs,1578374086.0,"Thanks for the tip. Did any of the vendors come through no problems?

Edit: How does Etinax hold up compared to Etibest?"
Clearnetmarkets,fdfyojs,t1_fdfvh8j,1578373950.0,No I guess I didn't. I'm really looking for powder but I really liked the Etibest I found a while back.
