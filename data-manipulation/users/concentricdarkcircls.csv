MerriamStyle,ffmq9ao,t3_eu7j4p,1580057851.0,"Look at your bone structure. Especially your shoulders, wrists, cheekbones, ankles. Are they wide or more moderate? Merriam's video on Bone Structure might help you find out."
Kibbe,ffm3dq1,t1_ffjd5nu,1580047834.0,"I disagree that different parameters should be used for different races. The boundaries of what even constitutes a particular race are blurry. Sure, some features might be slightly more common in some ethnicities, but I don't think the differences are dramatic enough to assign completely different standards for different races (it just seems like dangerous territory to enter). It would just mean certain types are more common among certain people. 

Lucy Liu isn't tall for an Asian, she's tall for a 5'3"" woman haha. And supposing a black woman had bigger lips and a rounder nose, if the rest of her body is long and narrow I don't think that would be enough to make her anything but Dramatic. 

As for Asians being Gamines...most actually look like Classics and Naturals to me. Maybe it's the stereotype of Asian women being childlike? Or am I overthinking this."
Kibbe,fflu3rj,t1_ffivfkk,1580044217.0,"Do you think you look better in long lines or shorter lines? To be a Gamine you have to have mixed Yin and Yang in your bone structure itself. Also many women have slight hourglass, it must be pronounced to be considered Yin flesh I think."
Kibbe,ffl9azl,t1_ffirbqg,1580036697.0,"That's quite accurate! Kibbe is 'an artist, not a scientist', so his art won't resonate with everyone. But it will touch anyone who does get it. 

That's also why I like Merriam Style, her approach to body typing and colour analysis provides certain tools and also logic behind them. Both systems are meant for different types of people."
Kibbe,ffk7y8b,t3_etzvfy,1580018446.0,"That's why I think saying 'soft flesh' is misleading, because that just makes us think of flab, which anyone can have. Yin flesh, in my mind, has a curving line even on the arms and legs. Yang flesh is straight up and down and just becomes wider with weight gain."
Kibbe,ffemvyl,t3_et0qk9,1579855032.0,Possibly Soft Classic
Kibbe,ffemv5d,t3_et2ptm,1579855000.0,I've heard her typed as Soft Natural. She looks good in SN outfits.
Kibbe,ffe42kf,t3_esyh72,1579836158.0,"This is a great perspective! I don't think Merriam really goes based only on face and essence though. She's actually trying to make body typing as objective and simple as possible - hence the neutral terms such as 'beveled' instead of Natural and 'mixed' instead of Gamine. 

She believes that a person will automatically look good in the lines that suit them. If you follow her system that's one of the major ways of figuring it out. She looked at pictures of TS wearing Gamine lines and decided she looked best in them. Personally I'm torn haha."
Kibbe,ffbm64n,t1_ffblu9p,1579772204.0,I agree. But she is a Romantic.
Kibbe,ffaw3yf,t1_ffaem4b,1579745850.0,I stand corrected
Kibbe,ff9lo1n,t1_ff5idzu,1579715608.0,Would you consider Drew Barrymore curvy?
Kibbe,ff8ww85,t3_esb4vj,1579698748.0,"Your face looks very Romantic here. It would be better if you posted some pictures of your body, though"
Kibbe,ff8wro1,t1_ff8u6k2,1579698635.0,"I'm 5'4"" and DC. Even within David Kibbe's guidelines that's allowed. As for celebrities, well, their fat and muscle percentages are different from the average person because of their strict diets and workouts. I would say comparing yourself to celebrities or even regular people might be misleading because we all look so different even within the same type. 

You may not be DC, ofc, it's just the vibe I'm getting. Side note: your body looks like a slimmer version of mine, haha."
Kibbe,ff8rvh0,t1_ff8p5z7,1579693633.0,Your flesh seems balanced but the way you describe your bone structure seems Yang. What do you think?
Kibbe,ff8nt2b,t1_ff74kff,1579687904.0,Maybe SC?
Kibbe,ff8nrbf,t3_erzmi8,1579687829.0,My estimation is Naturals > Romantics > Classics > Gamines > Dramatics
Kibbe,ff8nkgx,t3_es8ae5,1579687538.0,Maybe DC?
Kibbe,ff84n0i,t1_ff7r7co,1579665874.0,"Classics are also usually not perceived as sexy imo, because none of their features really stand out. Dramatics, Naturals and Romantics have slightly exaggerated proportions that can look quite sexy."
teenagers,ff81nrf,t3_cyhnzb,1579663648.0,I agree. His fans think they're super funny too lol
Kibbe,ff7w89v,t1_ff739w9,1579659836.0,"Yes but as you said, your friend's vertical line is shorter. Like in naturals we don't measure them to see how wide they are, it's more about the visual effect they have. So even if a woman isn't super tall, if her vertical line is long I think she could be a Dramatic. Of course the other features have to match as well, like facial features. Audrey Hepburn might have been D if she didn't look so short and have such short limbs, plus her smaller waist and facial features."
MerriamStyle,ff6mrwf,t1_ff5y2au,1579630525.0,"Hey! It's not tough to find Classic wear for Indians, I'm Indian DC :) I could help you out if you are SC"
Kibbe,ff58xog,t3_er7wmc,1579583772.0,"That last outfit is something I could wear as a DC, the blue in the blazer and the jeans provide uniformity and the white shirt is quite simple. It certainly looks great on you. So does the long blue dress (kind of SD).

If I could make a suggestion, you look more Dramatic than anything. You do have large eyes and lips but those won't really bar you from D. I don't think tall Gamines are impossible, though rare, I know one myself. But you look amazing in long lines."
Kibbe,ff3hf43,t1_ff3gy6e,1579541094.0,"I'm not a purist either (I believe vertical line is more important than height) but I think Kibbe says this nowadays? Apparently he typed a 5'4"" woman as Dramatic."
Kibbe,ff3dqz9,t3_erdw0m,1579539051.0,"I live in India, there are a lot of Soft Naturals and Romantics here. Yang features are not as common where I live. But maybe it's different in other states."
Kibbe,ff3dgrr,t1_ff3cmqp,1579538908.0,Actually short people can be Dramatic if they have long vertical line!
Kibbe,ff3d4qc,t3_erdmwy,1579538742.0,"I think long hair makes Gamines kind of look like fairies haha, it's not necessarily a bad thing even though short hair is more 'balanced'. 

As for your face looking SC/TR, it's difficult to pinpoint a single look for a category. Just look at FG celebrities, they all look so different because their Yin and Yang show up differently. 

Makeup...I actually think heavy makeup is too much for Gamines. Try boldly emphasising only one of your features, while keeping the other one minimal. Also highlighter is not recommended for Gamines I think.

Hope this helps!"
Kibbe,ff3atwl,t3_erdprd,1579537584.0,"Can't really say from these photos :/ you might be, but I see a lot of Yin in your face"

Kibbe,ff22tfh,t1_ff210zu,1579492269.0,"Salma Hayek has Soft Yang facial bones, definitely not sharp but kind of wide blunt face shape. On the Yang side for a TR"
Kibbe,ff1ennm,t3_eqi6h3,1579478238.0,"I see Flamboyant Natural, always have haha. She has a slightly broad and athletic build, but with a lot of sharp angles. I'm not sure at all though.

Kibbe,ff1cs16,t3_eqkdds,1579477532.0,Helena Bonham Carter? Her style is quite edgy.
Kibbe,ff1c5fq,t3_eqsptj,1579477386.0,"If you're in the Natural family, anything that has width and irregular lines will flatter you I think. Like wide leg pants, oversized sweaters, so on. If you're SN I would suggest using slightly lighter less stiff fabrics. And yeah tucking into pants gives nice waist emphasis :)"
Kibbe,ff1bezw,t1_feyrxgj,1579477134.0,"Hey man, I think there's a rule that you shouldn't tell someone their image ID is wrong if they didn't ask for advice. Not sure if it applies here though lol."

Kibbe,feq5iaw,t3_eqbag9,1579337913.0,"You seem to have a balanced skeleton with Yin flesh on top. I personally think you could be a Soft Classic, it depends on how important you think height is. Sometimes we can't figure it out immediately, so explore Kibbe a little more and maybe you'll find out."
Kibbe,fepyya4,t3_eqag63,1579334983.0,"Try to incorporate Yin into everyday clothes. For example, floral or small intricate print, ruching, small bows or puffed sleeves. The neckline should be slightly wide and rounded. For waist definition, you could tuck the top into jeans, or get a top that's slightly cropped and has an elastic band. 

You could pair the top with skinny jeans or leggings. I think slightly distressed shorts and jeans look great on TR :) Merriam Style has a great video on casual style for TRs"
femalefashionadvice,fephot9,t3_eq2df0,1579320768.0,Does anyone know where I can find a knee length skirt that goes straight down without flaring out? I don't want a pencil skirt since that's way too formal and I'm looking for something more casual. Preferably not denim.

Kibbe,fejvzqe,t1_fejohuk,1579187126.0,"
Maybe it's different in the West, but half of my clothes aren't stretchy and do have a silhouette to them. I do consider leggings, stretchy t shirts, jeans, etc to be neutral, at least silhouette wise. So...with the structured clothing I suppose I should keep the silhouette in mind right?"
Kibbe,fej3hbp,t1_fej0kb7,1579155491.0,"TR on SD? Wouldn't that make you look even more imposing? I have a casual TR or maybe R top and it's  too far away from my body's lines for me to make it work :/

Also I do think you can dress more casually as an SD as well"

Kibbe,fecdxp0,t3_eoeb0i,1578971622.0,"I know a lot of people will say SG or R but I think she's Soft Natural, because she has width in her bone structure especially her shoulders and wrists"

femalefashionadvice,febumm2,t1_feazsci,1578962911.0,"Thanks for the response! I've just heard from some blondes that they feel like dark colours wear them rather than the other way around. But then again, some other people like the striking contrast. 

If you do ever want to wear lighter colours, I think colours like white and sky blue would look great :) Just because your best colours seem to be quite cool and saturated, so cream and blush might be too muted for you."
Kibbe,feaodpo,t1_feadk7e,1578950826.0,"Being young doesn't make you SG, I think people associate looking young with being Gamine so young women are typed often types as Gamines."
