TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff5v7it,t3_eru990,1579611389.0,It definitely happens and is probably because there wasn't as much warming up as you're used to. It probably just created micro tears in your vagina and you saw the blood. Nothing to worry about!
depression,ff40w59,t1_ff40fq8,1579553121.0,Then you're not meeting the right people. The right person isn't going to care about your height.

I know a guy from college who is short. But you know what? He's an awesome guy and is making himself into something. Instead of loathing himself because of something he cannot control- he works on other things instead. His strength at the gym, his career, his hobbies, etc. That's what's more important."

childfree,ff3y3vk,t3_eritem,1579551382.0,I met my fiance through the BDSM community. There's definitely a lot of people who don't want kids in there!
childfree,ff3x98p,t3_erir1m,1579550852.0,OKCupid has the option to say you don't have and don't ever want kids. Then you can choose to see others with only that selected.

childfree,ff33w64,t1_ff33l9h,1579533023.0,Yeah even if I had all the money in the world to have a surrogate- I STILL wouldn't want a child because I don't want to create something that's biologically related to me. I don't want to pass on my genes.
childfree,ff32hea,t3_erdaj5,1579531955.0,"Love this post! Thanks for mentioning the 85 year old widow post. I hadn't seen it yet, it was a great read. 

I really like your rebuttal statement, saying that if the other person is right- then you'll just adopt. I've been sterilized, so that's basically my option if I regret it (which I highly highly highly highly doubt). It's a good way to shut them up!

I don't think your post is TMI at all. Those facts are really important to know about and take into factor if you're a fencesitter or are already firmly childfree."
childfree,ff2x37t,t3_ercwau,1579527361.0,You'll need to check the childfree friendly doctor list and find someone close to you. Make an appointment with that specific doctor and ask for the surgery.

personalfinance,fek1awf,t3_epl6xr,1579190476.0,"Most people who are big fans of credit cards have multiple cards. I'd say the biggest benefit is being able to use them differently and get different rewards. So I have a card that's 3% back on gas, I use that for just gas. My other card is 2% back on everything, so I use that for everything else. My third card is a store card for where I buy my work clothes, so I only use it at that store.

You just need to make sure your budget is good and you aren't confusing cards or anything like that."
introvert,fek0xc9,t3_epl2i3,1579190244.0,"As an introvert, I just have trouble with spontaneously having sex. I'm weird and like to plan ahead haha. Of course talk to her about this situation. But maybe she's like me and she needs a warning ahead of time. Like, ""hey before we make dinner tonight, let's go upstairs and do _______."" 

But keep talking to her about it and see how she feels. Obviously don't pester her to have sex, but see how she feels about it. Ask her what YOU can do for HER."
relationships,fek0hab,t3_epl2ne,1579189970.0,"It's truly up to you of course. But for me personally, I'm big on affection and physical touch too. I will hug, poke, pinch, kiss, squeeze, and hold my fiance for literally no reason. We are very affectionate and I love that. So I don't think I'd want to date someone who has trouble with just hugging. Do you guys cuddle?

The ""okay"" thing seems like something he might not realize he's doing. And it's possible that that can get better. But, you're going to have to talk to him more about it."

personalfinance,fee6uqr,t3_eopeq1,1579027613.0,"If you can do it, do it. You'd save so much on interest. But since I don't know your income, just make sure you have enough in savings as an emergency fund and such. 

Or, you could just pay off a good chunk of it. Even like 10k would be super helpful. I really like the website [unbury.me](https://unbury.me/) to help you figure out how much you'd be paying in interest."

I work full time, and I don't think it impairs me at ALL. I don't have any side effects and I sleep great! I did have some sleeping issues in the very beginning, but they subsided very quickly."
personalfinance,fee5md3,t1_fee4keq,1579026885.0,Oh yeah my parents are terrified of credit cards haha. They were nervous about paying with a debit card online for take out the other day lol.

I got one with the same bank I had been using since a teenager, since they were familiar with me. I started using it for my gas and groceries because that's what I got cash rewards for. I always paid it off in full, and my score rose. Now that I'm used to it and have multiple cards with higher limits- I put EVERYTHING on my credit cards. I get lots of cash rewards, and I haven't had to spend a penny in fees or interest!"

I am so happy where I am in life today. 

You have more freedom now. You can go anywhere you want to be, be whoever you want to be, it's all up to you. That freedom is well... freeing!

childfree,fe9l17i,t3_eo7onc,1578938891.0,"Totally agree. Yes, loving your children is HUGE but it isn't going to solve all issues. No matter how much you love them, they could still turn out to be horrible. They could still get in with the wrong crowd, end up a school shooter or something. 

Teens will hate their parents no matter what.

My parents love me. I know that. But do I resent them for a lot of things and really don't like being around them for very long? Absolutely."
childfree,fe96256,t3_eo6p50,1578934666.0,"There are more and more people in our generation that don't want kids. I know OKCupid has an option to say that you don't want kids, not sure about the others. Just try to filter that out."

Your cycle will be however it was before the surgery, without any hormones. So if you've been on birth control, your period will be like how it was before you got on birth control. A tubal does not change your period at all because your body still thinks it can get pregnant and will continue to try."

It is highly likely your children will have something of the sort. Just like how it's highly likely for a female with depression to experience post partum depression. 

Be honest with the person you're going to be with forever. They should know before things get too serious."

After that- just keep giving the extra money to the family you owe money too. Or don't do anything extra- since it's interest free, lol."

Remember that these procedures don't do anything to your hormones. Your body is still going to think it's able to conceive, so it's still going to go through the menstrual cycle each and every month. Some women stay on hormonal birth control after surgery just to control their periods though."
