occupywallstreet,ffgnnpu,t1_ffgjwtz,1579910472.0,"True. And he gets along fine with his white women guests, too. That's why it seems so weird that he almost never has minority women on his show.

Having had Bernie on his show, AOC would be an interesting guest for a three hour chat. Whoopi Goldberg would be fun. Aida Rodriguez is a comic and commentator on the Young Turks, she always has something to say. Cara Santa Maria hasn't been on his show in years, she's got lots to say about science and reason... There's plenty of minority women he could invite and probably get on his show."
occupywallstreet,ffggsl3,t1_ffg7ank,1579905896.0,"I've watched Rogan quite a bit, and all I've heard from him on trans issues is his criticism of having trans-men and -women competing in professional athletics, not that they should not be treated with dignity in their day to day activities as the gender they identify with.

I think the argument of whether someone should be allowed to compete in athletics or not based on sex/gender should be settled, or at least debated, by qualified sports doctors, not by sports commentators or athletes or ordinary fools like myself.

But yes, in this case I think that a faction of the pro-trans LGBT movement has a reasonably legitimate grudge against Rogan, and the Dem establishment is magnifying it because they are scared shitless Bernie is going to tax their wealth and will use any excuse to oppose him.

As far as racism and misogyny goes, the conspicuous lack of black women invited on his show, in spite of the plethora of black female comics among other potential black female guests, is reason to be a bit leery of Rogan on that count.

None of this is reason for Bernie to disavow Rogan's endorsement. It's not as if Rogan was supporting the drug war/prison industrial establishment, like Biden has consistently done throughout his career, resulting in huge percentages of black people incarcerated for nonviolent drug ""crimes."" If Bernie wins the nomination, he should disavow any endorsement from Biden. But he won't, it would be politically stupid."

antiwar,ffefgmn,t3_et1i94,1579845988.0,">But this year, we move the Clock 20 seconds closer to midnight not just because trends in our major areas of concern—nuclear weapons and climate change—have failed to improve significantly over the last two years. We move the Clock toward midnight because the means by which political leaders had previously managed these potentially civilization-ending dangers are themselves being dismantled or undermined, without a realistic effort to replace them with new or better management regimes. In effect, the international political infrastructure for controlling existential risk is degrading, leaving the world in a situation of high and rising threat. Global leaders are not responding appropriately to reduce this threat level and counteract the hollowing-out of international political institutions, negotiations, and agreements that aim to contain it. The result is a heightened and growing risk of disaster.

politics,ffe4t8a,t1_ffc9jxr,1579836712.0,"> Why do people always assume that homophobes are just gays that hate themselves?

Because it is so common to find news about some virulently anti-LGBTQ politician or preacher getting caught having or soliciting gay sex, almost always as rather sordid affairs involving prostitutes/one night stands rather than long-term loving relationships.

Certainly almost all of us have encountered homophobes in our daily lives who probably aren't interested in having gay sex, but the ones who use positions of power to oppress gays tend to get the attention of the news and inform popular opinion."

Ratified US Treaties become part of US Federal Law, thus Article 11, which states that the US is in no sense founded on the Christian religion, is the law of the land, indeed, signed by the founding fathers.

That is the most likely explanation for why he was assassinated, although there are some other reasonable theories, and we may never know the truth for certain.

All of the things I mentioned above are anti-left actions. Trying to defend the left by defending the Democrats is a lost cause.
