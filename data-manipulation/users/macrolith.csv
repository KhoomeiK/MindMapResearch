There is a pretty big difference between finding out together that bio kids aren't a possibility vs. keeping a secret until you feel like it's time to share it when it could be months down the road.  Not to mention what do you say when the topic of kids is brought up?  You gotta lie if you arent ready to confide, (not the right word but close enough).  Not a great way to start a relationship foundation."
