politics,ffhx2br,t3_etks9x,1579957700.0,"Both sides are always so wrong about shit like this. The left always thinks the right is enraged, when the right just thinks they’re right and schiff is wrong. Meanwhile when the right thinks the left is enraged it’s not really true either.

Basically the right took his speech as a grain of salt, and the left is taking the defense team with a grain of salt. Nobody is enraged and frankly nobody cares about impeachment much anymore. Everyone knows what’s gonna happen already. Everyone has their minds made up and there’s no changing unless some bombshell of hard evidence comes out"

Seems the Democrats in the Senate have decided that *reality* is wrong. They found no evidence, so now all that can do is accuse the White House of a “cover up” instead of actually providing their “overwhelming” impeachment evidence. Yeah, remember when Schiff told everyone he had solid proof of Russian interference?

The impeachment approval has already dipped down to the mid 40% range. Nice job electing Trump again in 2020, idiots."

The police donâ€™t go around shooting people for fun because they were just walking down the street. The police arenâ€™t gonna shoot you just because youâ€™re smoking a doobie on the sidewalk. Citizens see the police like this because the media portrays police as some sort of evil force that shoots anything that moves. Police have been shooting criminals for many many years, but the amount of police hate has exponentially grown over the past decade. Youâ€™re suggesting that the police go for innocent people all the time and that you should be scared of them. Fact is, it wasnâ€™t the police that caused this hate. It was the *news* and especially *social media* that started this unnecessary fear of the people who volunteer to protect the innocent, and enforce the law.

Their own people are on the verge of revolt, and they know the US can wipe them out in a few months. I donâ€™t want war, and Iran doesnâ€™t either. Theyâ€™re just going to do what theyâ€™ve always been doing: killing westerners with proxy terrorism."

Again, because the military was sent

Now I myself donâ€™t agree with a lot of shit trump does, in fact heâ€™s setting out a horrible image for conservatives in the long run. But I would support ANY president who killed this asshole. The fact that trump did it does not matter to me. Iâ€™d be praising Obama if he did it, Iâ€™d be praising bush if he did it."
