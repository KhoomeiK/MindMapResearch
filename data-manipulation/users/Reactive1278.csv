Twitter,fg13mg5,t1_fg0ze6h,1580420097.0,I’m getting very impatient. Part of my job is to communicate with our customers on twitter. They need a direct line to customer support for issues like this.
Twitter,fg0qfr8,t3_etj4sa,1580413004.0,Yesterday I changed my birthday and it glitches out and said I was born in 2012. I’m 20 years old so I am way over the 13 age limit. So my account is locked for age restriction. I sent them a photo of my ID which clearly states I’m 20 and I haven’t heard back from them yet. Does anyone know how long it’ll take for them to either reject or accept it? I did this last night around 6:30pm CST.
Twitter,fg0lr9h,t1_fg0kr1z,1580410346.0,How long does it take? I sent my ID at 6:30 CST last night and still haven’t heard back.
Twitter,fg0kaw8,t1_ffjvvoj,1580409516.0,I’ve submitted my ID twice now and I haven’t even gotten an email back rejecting it. I’m 20 now and I really don’t even remember when I made my account but I changed m my birthday last night to my real bday n now I’m locked out. So I guess I’m just asking if they send an email that your dispute was rejected?
modernwarfare,ffssu72,t1_ffsru7f,1580191194.0,Stim or nothing for me. Play too fast
todayilearned,ffsqric,t1_ffsljod,1580189170.0,Hey! I did too. Wasn’t he from Paw Paw? I remember learning about him in grade school but I can’t remember which town. It was one of em south of Peru for sure.
modernwarfare,ffsq97x,t1_ffsq4em,1580188691.0,Ooo fr? Thank god I can’t stand shoothouse dom any longer
todayilearned,ffskowr,t1_ffsixo3,1580184091.0,"Yeah I’ve snapped 2 fingers in half and dislocated 2 more at the same time. Yet, one time I got a splinter under my fingernail. Worst pain I’ve ever felt"
modernwarfare,ffshfng,t1_ffr34q5,1580181781.0,It’s very hard and time consuming. I’d honestly recommend going for it rn since shoot the ship is out cuz every other map besides shipment is just too hard
modernwarfare,ffshbbt,t1_ffryr3x,1580181702.0,Not a waste of time if he enjoyed getting it. You apparently don’t understand doing things you enjoy isn’t wasting time
modernwarfare,ffsgxur,t3_euqa6f,1580181442.0,Ay. Welcome to the brotherhood friend. May you never have to use the rpg on another kill streak again.
modernwarfare,ffsgp8o,t3_eusv3q,1580181281.0,"This map is the absolute worst domination map on this game. Don’t even say it’s not cause it is. I play a couple of fun games were both sides are constantly pushing and actually playing the obj. But, most of the time it’s just kids sitting in office and junkyard camping making it impossible to cap B so you’re just stuck in an everlasting loop of killing one person then getting killed by the kid in the other corner. This map is good. Just not in dom. Love hardpoint and headquarters tho"
todayilearned,ffs4yx8,t3_euve7r,1580173260.0,My late best friend who had leukemia once tried to describe to me what having leukemia felt like and he pretty much said that no other pain could possibly compare. For context he survived a brutal car accident and completely snapped his femur in half. And still the leukemia was harder for him. I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy
modernwarfare,ffnjtg1,t1_ffnet4z,1580066902.0,How is it unplayable on PC If I play on PC
modernwarfare,ffnb2j2,t1_ffn76ug,1580063856.0,Yeah it’s like some people have only played call of duty their entire lives. Before MW I played CS:GO for almost 4 years straight logging over 2300+ hours. Getting good at video games isn’t about only being good at one thing. You have to b able to adapt to whatever game your playing. People don’t understand that.
modernwarfare,ffn3wlg,t1_ffn3k6i,1580061784.0,Yeah getting gold on it was fucking hard. You have to get 25 double kills. You have to hit 2 consecutive shots on 2 people shooting at you with a 2 second reload after your first shot. Absolutely no room for error.
explainlikeimfive,ffn3j0b,t1_ff3dlhk,1580061651.0,Wow that was the best analogy I’ve read maybe my entire life.
modernwarfare,ffn36fp,t1_ffn2ofc,1580061541.0,I’m on PC so I’m really not to sure ab what you can do on PS. Is there a way you can scan for updates? Can another PS player help out with some info on this
modernwarfare,ffn2ztn,t1_ffn2hl0,1580061475.0,Yeah I really don’t understand why they don’t put every change they made in the patch notes. I’m gonna stay optimistic tho considering the BR has had so much time to be ironed out (hopefully). And as the game progresses multiplayer should eventually become more balanced.
modernwarfare,ffn2flr,t1_ffn15ay,1580061266.0,Hmm MP doesn’t work at all? You might have to just reinstall. But damn that’s a hassle considering the size of the game.
modernwarfare,ffn2b88,t1_ffn0ypw,1580061222.0,I agree w this. I was so excited for 1.13 cuz I was hoping we would get some refreshing content but just adding a crossbow that isn’t even really viable did not do this.
modernwarfare,ffn24re,t1_ffn0i75,1580061157.0,"Yeah I’ve played spec ops only once, and it was unbearable lmfao. Spec ops should most definitely be fixed."
modernwarfare,ffn1xxj,t1_ffmzj73,1580061089.0,"It’s not even that you can’t use the old run n hun playstyle of other cods. There is definitely an advantage of just sitting in a corner w a 725, but at this point in the game I know what corners kids will sit in and you can still run n gun if you have the accuracy and game sense. I do agree that shitters are the ones complaining the most. I don’t even use meta weapons and I still have a 2.2 K.D. And a 2.5 W/L. IMO other guns offer massive advantages over the current meta weapons. My personal favorite the Bizon has a much higher multi kill potential than the MP5 even tho the MP5 is immensely better. Most people in this game however usually miss their first 1-2 shots giving you ample time to hit yours winning gun fights against M4s and MP5s. I’m gonna say that obviously the MP5 is much better than the Bizon, but people are getting so used to being able to miss their shots because you can still wreck ppl with the insane TTK. Jus my experience anyway"
modernwarfare,ffhfhq8,t3_etc8ul,1579933059.0,I think it should count. However I think you should be able to stack weapon perks. I can’t tell you how nice that would be as someone who likes sniping. Focus is so important when using something like the MK2 but it also takes forever to reload which makes you wanna use sleight of hand.
SubredditDrama,ffcflsy,t1_ffcc50n,1579798409.0,I live in the burbs of Chicago. And driving into the city (not during rush hour) most cars are going around 80-85 mph.
modernwarfare,ffajl5b,t1_ffagrxm,1579737340.0,Yeah idk. My roommates and I pay for business since we’re all gamers and we’ve never heard anything about a cap.
modernwarfare,ffacsrp,t1_ffa945t,1579732509.0,I go over 1tb all the time tho?
modernwarfare,ffa8id3,t1_ffa84ft,1579729950.0,Really?? I live in the burbs of Chicago and I have never seen anything like that. And they’ve never pushed anything like that on me so that’s wack
modernwarfare,ffa7oqg,t1_ffa70lv,1579729490.0,Yeah I live in the US and I don’t have a data cap on my WiFi. Maybe it’s just certain plans? Idk I hate xfinity but at least they don’t do that shit
AskReddit,fep8dpu,t3_eq1a8z,1579314435.0,"The bean in Chicago. 

It’s literally just a big mirror that looks like a bean. And it’s gross and the creator sucks"
modernwarfare,feexmnm,t1_fedohzv,1579043444.0,When I was goin for the knife I got a 116 kill specialist game on shipment. It was extremely hype. Ended up gettin that puppy gold in like 2 hours
AskReddit,fe4j4tv,t1_fe4fyio,1578859881.0,According to my grandpa the man actually lived. He had to get a complete skin graph over his face tho
AskReddit,fe4chrn,t3_enjev0,1578857846.0,My grandfather was an ex state police officer and he told me that one time he was called to a grain bin explosion (very explosive if you didn’t know). When he showed up he found the farmer laying in the grass with his face almost melted off. Apparently the guy looked at my grandpa and told him to shoot him.
AskReddit,fdx2b1z,t3_en3o6k,1578764592.0,"Every single Tarantino movie. The amount of detail and Easter eggs he puts in his movies is unreal. Also, I feel like you can’t really get the whole story of his movies without watching them at least twice"
modernwarfare,fdr8ma9,t1_fdr80nl,1578681048.0,I mean I still have a decent KD at 1.5 but I don’t even really look or care about it. I just like to play.
modernwarfare,fdr6wz0,t1_fdr6avw,1578680274.0,Yeah I learned you can’t take this game too seriously. I mostly play ground war and cyber attack and I fucking love this game now. Almost got the Damascus grind done too
Unexpected,fdhbs1m,t3_elbjvq,1578419556.0,Crackheads are the real life equivalent of super heroes and you can’t change my mind
YouShouldKnow,fdh2bfv,t1_fdgbfql,1578413854.0,When I got my wisdom teeth taken out the second I woke up from the anesthesia I threw up blood all over myself.
depression,fdg4l2q,t1_fdg48up,1578379788.0,Yeah I told them I’m gonna start being more open with them about how I’m feeling. I really hope I can follow through but I bet it’ll b hard
Whatcouldgowrong,fdfbs45,t1_fde8zwb,1578357969.0,I agree w this. Imagine having the guilt of killing a dog just because some dumbass decided to jaywalk w one not wearing a leash.
depression,fdfblyp,t1_fdf4s7u,1578357855.0,"Just finished. Lots of crying. Their initial reaction was that they somehow messed up. I assured them that I was the one that should’ve been open to them about the whole situation. I feel bad for them, they really didn’t do anything wrong yet I feel like they’re blaming themselves."
AskReddit,fdcmw7d,t1_fdb275b,1578278869.0,From a rural midwestern town. Can agree w this 100%. Most of the kids my age blindly support causes they know nothing about just because they were told to.
