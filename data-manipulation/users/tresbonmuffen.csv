PersonalFinanceCanada,ffjpfqz,t1_ffjp8hg,1580003650.0,"Apologies. I’m dyslexic. Hah. It’s a fun spelling life. I had to look up statue and statute and stare at them like I wanted to eat them to see the difference. 

Thanks for pointing it out! :)"
londonontario,ffjoyr6,t1_ffcysj5,1580003334.0,I don’t know about that but assume that with driverless taxis the idea would be that they are cheaper because there are no labour costs. I’m guessing that is the direction of e-cars.
Maher,ffjoj98,t3_etuk0v,1580003039.0,"Yeah, why didn’t he go harder on her? The hardest question was if her children were in fact midgets."
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffjnx72,t1_ffjns64,1580002623.0,"Yeah, that’s probably how I got into the mess. Fair enough. 

You are totes making up information though so you could confuse someone."
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffjn9dc,t1_ffjm1w0,1580002178.0,"Two separate debt consultants have told me otherwise about the potential of insolvency and that link doesn’t say that it’s not possible. Mate, are you just like mad at it? I know, I’m naughty, I didn’t pay back my loan, spank me. I’m trying sort it out okay? Stup making sh*t up."
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffjmwz0,t1_ffjmkpq,1580001951.0,"Also, I do love how you make up facts about the CRA. They did not inquire into what I paid in the other countries, only about the dates on my passport when I left and returned - omitting visits."
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffjmpo7,t1_ffjmkpq,1580001809.0,Do they use different collection agencies for provincial and federal? Or will the debt always be together?
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffjmadc,t1_ffjliax,1580001527.0,"I don’t need the residency explained to me, I understand it and was already declared a non resident by CRA. It was extreme easy to achieve and there is a special office that you deal with. 

No ever came after me through other governments and I was a resident of three other countries over ten years. I’m telling you my factual experience versus what youve heard? 

Also the insolvency companies (getting multiple options) I’ve been dealing with have never mentioned any medical claims and are pretty certain I’ll be fine to negotiate. 

Back to my original question though."
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffjlt8i,t1_ffjlgd6,1580001201.0,And so you’re saying you don’t think this (the 7 years) is effected by the non residency?
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffjkwga,t1_ffjkp1c,1580000578.0,"Can’t you negotiate an insolvency, even on student debt after so many years? 

I lived outside of the country for several years, paying taxes in the other countries. Went I returned I was advised by CRA that I could be declared a non resident to avoid having to do all the back taxes."
startrek,ffidt2e,t3_etqv5c,1579971483.0,"Was anyone else unable to cast from CTV Sci fi? I almost cried but I was so excited to watch the episode I watched it on my iPad. Regular CTV does cast. 

Please tell me if you know how to fix it."
TechNewsToday,ffi5uy5,t3_etpfyt,1579965894.0,I like this. I hope goodlife joins bc that’s where I gym and I don’t have a smart watch but this sounds interesting to me. Was never really interested in having emails on my wrist.
HolUp,ffdvy82,t3_esvry6,1579830272.0,How come the other kids aren’t dressed up?
TheHandmaidsTale,ffavsgy,t3_es9j74,1579745640.0,I thought this was such a great part of the testaments as it’s true that extremists groups do recruit >! and of course they would go look for handmaid it the fact they they go recruit to be aunts i don’t understand at all. !<I’m only 60% done the book though.
TheHandmaidsTale,ffamvhh,t3_es5hsl,1579739677.0,"I always got the vibe from the book that she killed herself because of Gilead. I cant remember if it was said but it was the first handmaid and I’m sure it was just crazy town by all involved. At the time Gilead was newer and more of the women committed suicide, as time went on they better prepared the houses to make it more difficult for the handmaids to do and the women who lived there probably took on more psychological something rather, the effect of all the trauma and killed themselves less. More likely the former though."
politics,ff7tgig,t3_erzkb1,1579657952.0,And welcome to Australia’s minimum wage. Do we hear about the same issues facing Australians? Medical bankruptcy? Crippling student debt? Lack of millennias buying homes? Nope.
politics,ff7svgg,t1_ff7sfvz,1579657544.0,"For real, when Bernie says not me, us. I’m thinking is mapleheads too because our leadership is not that great, trudeau is a haircut and Ford (I’m in Ontario) is a megalomaniac."
politics,ff7rqfq,t1_ff7ldww,1579656757.0,"Yeah and I think the amount of $ being sucked out of Americans for Heath care has negatively effected Canadian health care. Less coverage all the time and more expensive prescriptions. The greed crosses the border, honestly Canada needs a Bernie! We had Jack Layton but sadly we lost him before he won the election."
offmychest,ff5rm6s,t3_erorsn,1579607540.0,"There is nothing sexier in this world then a dude who can show he does want you but only when you’re keen, completely without pressure. 

From experience, don’t tell dudes about what happened whom you planned to sleep with but tell all your gfs. It’s happened to most women at some point."
Dyslexia,ff4nip4,t1_ff4j0ks,1579567922.0,This is good advice. I’m not so social so I used to just draw out words over and over and over and memorizing the shapes and patterns of the spelled word. Also sometimes writing in cursive helped me.
TheHandmaidsTale,ff4ig9g,t1_ff4agk5,1579564388.0,"https://io9.gizmodo.com/margaret-atwood-says-she-doesnt-write-science-fiction-5349583

I think this is where it all started."
TheHandmaidsTale,ff45n3d,t1_ff3psmm,1579556074.0,"Yo! I just had to leave a subreddit because I was getting verbally mauled for any criticism AND can you believe I considered Atwood part of the sci fi canon. 

You wanna start a sci-fi subreddit for ladies? I feel like every mansplainer came out to get me, one misspelled word and I was toast. 

Maybe my write up encouraged our young student to read the book or pay it forward one day. Honestly you don’t even have to ask to start breaking down my thoughts on any sci-fi I have read. I’ll just prattle on."
TheHandmaidsTale,ff2sg4s,t1_fey09nd,1579522170.0,I feel like she is definitely a sci-fi writer but I think it’s actually she herself who proclaims she is not because every thing she writes is based on things that have happened but I too thought about Oryx ans Crake. The plebs! It’s such a good book.
TheHandmaidsTale,ff2sbbb,t1_ff1oo6j,1579521990.0,"Yes, you should never do something to help a stranger. Noted. Honestly I’m not naive or slow, I am aware that I don’t know this person or that I have to help them and the fact that it bothers this many people says more about y’all.  It’s just a kid who didn’t do their homework."
TheHandmaidsTale,ff2s4vf,t1_ff22nry,1579521748.0,I suspect read is made up of plenty of Aunt Lidia types just waiting to keep the rest of us in line. Surely they are extra drawn to this subreddit. :)
TheHandmaidsTale,ff1iyeu,t1_ff1hiwq,1579479954.0,"I also got downvoted by all the aunts in this chat room. You never know why someone is struggling, no reason to be a dick. :)"
TheExpanse,ff01wmd,t3_er09lf,1579464339.0,Even Canadian have completely stopped using the metric system. It’s so confusing. What is an inch y’all? It’s like measuring weight in stones.
fasting,fezr9yj,t3_er0hz7,1579460646.0,Also - I fast 18-6 and have for about two years. Was 88kgs and now 70kgs. Have been trying to get to to 68kgs for the last six months but it seems my body is not into it without more extreme measures which I haven’t explored.
Dyslexia,fez0d7c,t3_eqylle,1579452701.0,Maybe you could just ask ppl for their initials so you have less letters to process while you’re trying to work fast?
TheHandmaidsTale,fex8mrl,t3_eqsudg,1579426895.0,"It’s a great book and ones of of those early books I read that made me a life long reader, so do give it a try.  I am a dyslexic, reading can be so intimidating for us but if you just practice reading paper books it gets easier over time, I promise. Don’t give up, if that is your problem. 

When the sons of Jacob take over the US congress (? - can never remember the branch of government they attack as am not american)  to form gilead they implement all these rules to protect citizens because of these terrorist attacks, one of the rules is that women no long can have money or bank accounts (money is all digital at the point - written in the 80s so this is a component that makes the book sci-fi ish) all money owned by women is transferred to their male next of kin (husband, brothers, fathers, uncles) and when women need to buy something they have to have written permission from their male next of kin. 

Not long after this, women are not allowed to work. This is explained in the book by the main character June who has flashbacks from her previous life before she was captured and made a handmaid.  For some strange reason she didn’t take this as a sign early enough to get the fuck out of dodge and by the time she tries to escape it’s too late. 

Also her mother is an active feminist who warns her like foreshadowing throughout her life about why it’s important to be an active member of the US democracy, kind of like, if you don’t hold those in power accountable your freedoms can slip away and you might even think it’s for your own good before it’s too late. Later as a handmaid she regrets how much she wrote her mother off as a kooky protesting feminist when she was actually predicting what ended up happening. This is where the argument that Atwood is not a sci-fi writer comes from because none of this is fiction, it’s all actually happened at some point in time on this earth. 

Good luck!"
Maher,fevydne,t3_eqo8ld,1579403116.0,I like it. I saw this presentation on the political necessity of always maintaining persuadables in discourse by exercising non exclusion. He is bang on to try not to completely lose the persuadables by always offering a seat at the table.
TheExpanse,fev7gcw,t1_fev739y,1579394055.0,"Gene Roddenberry is an icon. He, Philip k Dick and Margaret Atwood are part of the sci-fi canon. Prove me wrong with more than downvotes :)"
