NevilleGoddard,ff6pmty,t3_erkpo2,1579632247.0,Can you manifest more episodes for me? The season was too short!
funny,ff6313p,t1_ff5sayq,1579617869.0,"Nope, Ubisoft. I used to love The Sims, but I didn't like to make them look like me--they were always getting into terrible situations and I didn't want to watch myself suffer."
aww,ff5avli,t3_eipk0o,1579585602.0,"UPDATE for anyone who comes back to this post:

He stayed a while. A week or more. Then, one day, he decided to fly right over to say hi. He landed on my pillow and was presumably there to cuddle. That was when I decided he needed to find love in his own species. 

So, I let him outside via an open window. He walked, gently at first, from the pillow to the roof-- taking his time, as if to let our last moments together linger. As he got to the end of the pillowcase, he took that first step onto the shingle as though he were dipping a long, spindly toe into a cold swimming pool on a warm day. He paused to consider his options one last time, and then he leapt.

I don't know if I'll ever see that stink bug again, but I'm glad he had a nice stay."

Keep singing if you love it, you can only get better with more practice and experience. Don't keep it secret much longer. The world is eager to share in your gift!"

I love them."

AskReddit,fetnrqm,t1_fetmuzw,1579377333.0,"I just realized that Miss Piggy, while a Muppet, never appeared on Sesame Street. While this makes my answer wrong by default, the fact that Henson found her NSFSS just kind of proves my theory."
AskReddit,fetmuzw,t3_eqk5sa,1579376992.0,Miss Piggy is a freak. She's dominant and into cross-breeding.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fetlqio,t3_eqjq22,1579376692.0,"Could you tell what kind of an event it was? Is it possible that you happened onto a movie set or some kind of horror LARP? That would explain the store looking dated and weird, the gross guy (if he was in character, maybe), and why everyone was looking at you strangely."
