Anxiety,ffgzf9i,t1_fdmorui,1579919021.0,"Im sorry for this late reply(Ive had no time to myself since school). No, I have not looked into that. I should because the the first does not always work."
Anxiety,fdmax4v,t1_fdm7lgp,1578544260.0,"That's a tough situation to be in :(
Controlling thoughts can be really hard.
I guess it depends on the thoughts and the situations.
I try to be a healthy amount of positive. I find it keeps the negative thoughts at bay, and it's easier to challenge those bad thoughts.  
Have you found anything that works or helps?"
college,fdm7riy,t3_elzg04,1578541889.0,"I'm in college and have social anxiety too. Do you experience shortness of breath, fast heart rate, and stiffness? You should look into cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety. It helped me improve a lot. It didn't completely go away but I feel hell of a lot better. I made a post about recently and then came across your post. I also feel like I have missed out. Part of it was anxiety and the other part was not having social skills. A book called The Fine Art of Small Talk by Debra Fine helped me with the latter."
Anxiety,fdm56ij,t1_fdm2re5,1578540062.0,That's happened to me too a few times. It's horrible to say the least. I had to light a candle in a room full of people (I was offered the lighter against my wishes) and I was scared people saw my hand shaking.
Anxiety,fdm4mqv,t1_fdm1zx7,1578539681.0,You're welcome! :)
AskReddit,fdl0z75,t3_elssvy,1578515141.0,I thought Jesus was a woman.
politics,fdjiww4,t1_fdjgxqd,1578472905.0,I like your attitude towards people of different political affiliation. Keep planting the seeds! I used to be right leaning and my sister is left. She opened my mind to new perspectives and now I consider myself a centrist.
AskMen,fdgpnfv,t1_fdgm30l,1578404989.0,"I knew a girl in high school who loved to talk about how short she was. I'm 5'1 and a half and my little sister is 5'3. This girl was the same height or slightly more than my sister. When this girl and I compared our heights she hunched her back to appear shorter, and her tall bf bought it. I think girls do it to be cute, and they think it's more attractive for some reason. I  would prefer to be taller or him shorter to have less distance between me and a man."
JUSTNOMIL,fddrgia,t1_fdd94rh,1578322041.0,You almost made me spit out my drink.
college,fd6qan8,t1_fd62uk2,1578194419.0,"Thank you it was stressing me out. Whew! Out of curiosity, what made you decide to go to business school?"
college,fd6l5un,t1_fd5qg44,1578192634.0,That is something to think about. I'll research jobs and see if I can see myself doing them. Thanks!
selflove,fcu00si,t3_eiu0gn,1577967723.0,"You can begin by memorizing self love affirmations. Pick some that mean a lot to you. That way when you have a bad thought you have a good thought to counter it. No matter how wrong it feels keep going. There have been times I had to yell at myself in my thoughts. It helped me get through to myself. 

Here is an example: 
You said you feel like you don't deserve it. Tell yourself, ""I am worthy of infinite compassion."" Yell it over and over until you finally accept it. 
It's worked for me so far. It takes a lot of work and discipline but you are worthy of every second it takes to get there."
suggestmeabook,fcoz0rg,t1_fcn6f44,1577845531.0,I'll definitely check them out. Thank you.
relationships,fcl4lxu,t1_fck9cy5,1577739695.0,Its unfair for the little sister to have to do it alone. I think she ought to hold that above her sister's head so she can have some help. Ridiculous she should have to clean a mess that's not hers but sadly older sis probably wont do it otherwise.
getdisciplined,fcdfhtz,t3_c9oxs3,1577609511.0,"I know this comment is super late but thank you. You gave really good advice. I'm beginning my journey of self love. I really related to a lot of what you said. The ""weird and lonely kid"" hit right at home. I realized I never had confidence. I never stood up for myself when people were being jerks to me. I've never loved myself. A lot of my bad habits I realize I get from my mother who also has low self confidence. Anyway, thanks again."
atheism,fc2oxk4,t3_efrtq8,1577369583.0,"Our local newspaper published nine and ten year olds' Christmas lists. There was one girl who wrote, "" I don't believe in Santa but I want... "". My thought was future atheist if not one already."
