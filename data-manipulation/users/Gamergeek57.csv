I also have anxiety and GAD and was overweight so didn't like working out with anyone other then my personal trainer. Before I was recommended to adult highschool at 17 ( not due to bad grades as all the classes I attended even though I might have only been there half the time I had high 80's or low 90's in) they tried to see if they could get my sessions with my personal trainer counted towards a PE credit."

They could have had the forts kind of like what they did with districts in Mafia 3 with a few tweaks mostly in main power. For instances giving forts to Lelianna would give you more secrets, extra dialogue etc. while giving them to cullen would increase the amount of inq soldiers in an area once its claimed so there will be more patrols that could help you and boosting up the power of the army in general while giving them to Josephine unlocks other dialogue options such as potential alliances and supports from the nobles in that area. Have it so that during the assault that depending on how you distributed the forts and how well you got to know your teammates that they can either die or survive.

dragonage,ffsyjdf,t1_ffsk4zu,1580197894.0,"However because of that crunch time its one of the many reasons most game companies give their employees at least one month of paid vacation time a year. Some of the bigger ones even go up to two months. One of the things before I dropped out of college I learned when taking video game development and design ( dropped out due to the college and the way they handled the course I.E instructor was horrible we went through 3 of them in under 6 months, the books we were given were out of date etc.) is that crunch is a huge thing we should be prepared for and like it or not its a part of the development cycle. We were even talking there about even if a game does get pushed back theres still that period of crunch time where devs are trying to fix the bugs. Crunch time will never not exist due to game companies wanting to have their product be as bug free and complete as possible. The only thing that pushing the release date back would do is make it so that there isn't as much major problems in the game to fix during the crunch time and to make day 1 patches smaller"

memes,ffsxvsf,t3_ev05sb,1580197056.0,"I remember when I was going to a private college I got stuck  visiting my parents for a week after xmas break due to the weather ( I went to college 8 hours away). My parents lived in the country and the day I was meant to head back to my apartment we got hammered with a snow storm. It got that bad that on the mountain passes the snow banks were piled up higher then the actual snow plows. My college kept calling me almost every single day asking when I'd be back and I told them it was storming. They then told me that it was none of their concern and that I should be in classes. Told the one that kept track of attendance am not going to kill myself just to go back up and attend classes. I then sent her a picture of the snow. Fast forward a few weeks later I was told I'd have to make up for that week I missed by staying a bit late for the next month after classes. They then said the next day that their introducing a new policy that if you were unable to make it to class due to the weather that you wouldn't have to make up the time as long as you had some evidence to show that the weather was bad. I went to the one in charge of attendance and let her know the week I missed was due to the weather. She asked me to prove it so I showed her a picture of how high the snow was piled on the mountains ( there were two mountains but it's the only way to get off the island from where my parent's lived) she then told me that I still have to make up for the time because it didn't count as I was out of province. That college was fucked to say the least. Found out by my instructor who didn't help at all  that the administration was refusing to let him fail students who plagiarized work. The text books we got were horrible and if you asked him for help he would tell you the answer was in the textbook only for it not to be and him realize that it wasn't by the end of class. The college reputation was actually horrible ( i didn't realize this until after I enrolled) they were that bad and the students in my course were that bad during their work placement no one in the city would hire them. In fact they were that bad that years ago they use to be named another college however their reputation was that shit one day they just fired all their employees, closed the company, opened back up under another name then hired all their staff back. I wont say the name of the college on here for reasons however any fellow Canadians stay away from a private college with the initials E.C.

aww,ffsx7zt,t1_ffsw0xr,1580196207.0,"The thing is dogs should listen to you like that and if you have them properly trained they do. The only time my parents dogs listen to them is if they have a treat or tell them to come get a treat. My dogs for example will come to me or do what I say without the ""motivation of food"" because they know if they don't listen they're getting put in the kennel for a bit.  If your dog only listens when you have treats then it's not properly trained. It would be the same as your kid only doing something you tell them do when you say you'll give them money."
aww,ffsx29t,t1_ffre66k,1580196007.0,"This here my parents have their 3 Pomeranian trained to piss and crap on puppy pads they have even though they let  them outside. The youngest one is 3 years old but they get mad when the dogs decide to piss in the house and over everything when they don't have the pads down. There was an incident where I had to take the oldest pom to live with me for a bit ( its part my dog, the incident was that he bit my niece after my niece pulled at his face, my brother was in another room and my SIL was outside smoking. My parents actually wanted to give him away to my grandmother but I told my mother f no) and it took me about 6 weeks to get him trained not to use the washroom in my apartment and to go to my door when he needs to go out like my German shepherd and lab/pit are trained to do. 

&#x200B;

Its funny because my parents were looking after my lab/pit for a time also ( took me a long ass time to get her properly trained again) and they ended up asking my cousin to watch their 2 poms and my lab.  The other dogs pissed all over my cousins couch. My cousin told me this and asked me if I had trained Lacy. I told her yes and she said that she could tell because she was the only dog that actually listened and would go to the door to single she needed to use the washroom. My cousin also asked me if the other dogs usually piss in the house because my mother told her it was odd for them to do that Now me and this cousin are close. I consider her more of a sister and I told her that they also piss in the house especially the female pom as she barley listens and if shes on a couch and if you go to move her she'll piss on the couch. But anyway that's another story"
aww,ffswnn7,t1_ffs9ufb,1580195501.0,"Its because pits have higher pain tolerance then other dogs. before the media turned pits into "" Monsters that will turn on you any second"" they use to be called nanny dogs and a fact alot of people may not know is that they use to use them as therapy dogs in childrens hospital due to their high pain tolerance. So if a kid ends up being a kid and pulls on them a little to rough they barely feel it. If you train them right I.E make it clear that your the dominant person. Then pits are the best dogs you can have. 

&#x200B;

I usually only have to tell my pit something twice before she does it. She likes to play stupid so if I tell her to do something she'll just look at me and cock her head to the side but as soon as I say now after the command she goes and does it. In fact like most dogs she hates taking pills but needs medication due to a skin condition that she has. All I have to do is put the pill in her mouth and tell her to swallow and she swallows it."

I told them about the time that my mother asked me to help move her dresser. I heard a clank when I lift it up and never thought anything of it until my mother started laughing. I asked whats so funny and she pointed with her foot to her dildo that just fell out of the drawer. My uncle then told me that when my youngest cousin was about 6 or 7 him and my aunt were getting it on and she walked in on them and as soon as my uncle saw her he started yelling "" Oh god this cramp is really bad"""
