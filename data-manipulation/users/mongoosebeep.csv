It is probably less obvious to the people close to you, they see you all the time but I appreciate it would still be so frustrating. As long as you are happy with your progress that is really all that matters but I know easier said than done."
intermittentfasting,fe5svcq,t1_fe3nq6h,1578874203.0,"You can do it for whenever suits you. I've only started but I find lunch and dinner works best for me. I often don't eat breakfast and even though a do get hungry in the morning I can manage it with hot drinks like green or black tea and the general business of work means I don't have time to eat. If you don't feel so hungry in the evening and get hungrier in the mornings, you could start your window with breakfast. That's what I'm liking about the IF, you can tailor it to you."
