TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffhcg9o,t1_ffhc4me,1579929809.0,"No offense taken lol. I planned for him and I stayed home with him for the first 4 years, but he wanted and needed preschool for socializing at least, and money got tight so I now work out of the home part time and send him to pre-k part time. He starts kinder this fall and then it will be 5 days a week and free! I'm looking for full time jobs now after 5 years of mostly just being a mom lol. I'm going to miss all the time we had together, but it's just the progression of life with kids."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffhbvwy,t1_ffhb6fv,1579929251.0,Yes. My son goes to preschool/pre-k and I pay maybe a couple dollars less a day than the daycare for 2 and under.

Nothing has changed really."
earthbound,fem3f43,t3_epmq9t,1579238454.0,"I'm so happy reading this! My first experience with Earthbound was watching my dad play when I was 7. I LOVED watching him play. He never completely finished it, but made a copy of his file for little me and my younger siblings and cousins to dink around with and explore and play with most of the story being completed already but the whole map/teleportation skill available. It wasn't long after that I made my own file. I beat the game my first time around 12 I think, and it has forever been my favorite game. Like you, I never go more than a couple years without picking it up and replaying it again. Now I'm 32 and have a 5 yr old son. He started watching me play around the age of 3, and he loves the game. He tries to play, but isn't quite there yet to playing it and understanding it since he can't read. But he loves playing on our SNES classic from time to time. I think it's time for another play through, actually ;)

Seriously such a good game. The story, the characters, the music, the goofy enemies and goofy dialogue. I can't recommend this game enough to people!"

AskReddit,fecqihj,t1_fechbev,1578980917.0,"I totally have sympathy for your sister being in her 50s and supposed to be an empty nester but starting with kids again. 

My parents are in their 50s and we have a large, blended family. But all of us ""kids"" are grown. My parents have had to take on my sibling's child, and this child has a lot of special needs. They are retiring very soon and have all these plans to do things they want to do and should be able to do as empty-nesters, but they have a child with special needs that requires a lot of things. I'm really glad my parents got the kiddo instead of him going into the foster system (when this first happened, none of my siblings or I were in a good place and/or old enough to adopt the little) but I can see how this drastically changes everything for them."

cats,fdubgsn,t3_en1vnn,1578730839.0,"So happy for you that you got him back! My furry man was missing for 10 days before I found him and I was so messed up the entire time (plastering flyers everywhere, driving and walking the neighborhood(s), checking shelters, posting on Nextdoor [which is how I eventually got him home]). When he got home, he smelled like tires and was skinny and thirsty so he ate for like an hour and drank for like 30 minutes and then he slept in my bed for a good whole day. I can only imagine your relief/joy when you finally found your furry dude! Happy reunion to you both!"
