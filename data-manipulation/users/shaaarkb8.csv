facepalm,feiy8d7,t1_fei465t,1579150554.0,"Change in motion is relative depending on the reference frame. I see what you’re saying tho, for all practical purposes we can consider gravity a force because of our reference frame, the earth, but on a greater scale it’s not. I have an awesome video that goes into greater detail than I could. You should check it out. [here](https://youtu.be/Xc4xYacTu-E)"
facepalm,fei1fhb,t1_fei0k3l,1579128190.0,"I didn’t say it was wrong, and I didn’t say we should stop using the word. I just said gravity wasn’t a force and I tried to explain that concept."
facepalm,feh67zq,t1_fegt619,1579109995.0,"The “force” of gravity doesn’t exist. What you feel is the natural curvature of space time towards a massive object, and you moving thru space time. Cosmic laziness states that all things tend to move towards slower time, and because of the earth time is slower for your feet than it is for your head. When you go “down” you are actually moving in a straight line thru time"
