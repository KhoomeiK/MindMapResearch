Not sure how old he is, but he sounds super immature. If you feel uncomfortable or not safe and afraid you might be affected by his words and holding onto you like this, then leave for the sake of your health."

But anyway, I’ve been thinking this lately too but I also really want you and everyone else here to eventually learn to love their lives."

depression,fc8zghs,t1_fc8yn9h,1577544571.0,"Wow, reading your post was like a roller coaster of emotions. Gentle and compassionate and then tough and critical the next. I think saying things like, “stop being a cunt...” and general, “stop being negative” comments sort of deny the feelings of OP."
depression,fc8y3d7,t3_egpdqp,1577543943.0,"Man o man. I’m sorry you feel this way. Just yesterday I was thinking about how much I hate myself and everything that is wrong with me. But after all the self hate episodes in my head, I am realizing that other people don’t think that about me. Other people don’t perceive me as the loser I think I am. Maybe the negative things aren’t as true as you tell yourself they are. 

I guess you are feeling so defeated and tired of living. And your feelings are totally valid. But let’s not leave yourself there. Your life CAN get better. Maybe your circumstances may not immediately improve but you can definitely FEEL better and love yourself again. Not by making more money or getting a boyfriend or looking better, but understanding the truth that you are an awesome person deserving of love but deprived of these things. And therefore the efforts to improve your life is NOT wasted on you. You deserve a community of people who love and support you to make you feel like you’re gonna be okay. Yes sure we make mistakes too, but there are a lot of assholes out there who just don’t know how to respond correctly to things. 

*I give you internet hugs.* I hope you will find the right help that you need. <3 my heart goes out to you."

It’s important that this issue is addressed and your needs are just as valid as hers. Have you guys ever talked about it, and if so, where has it led to?"
