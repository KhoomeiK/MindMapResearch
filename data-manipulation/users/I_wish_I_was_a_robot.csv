If you just Google m2 form factor you can see that it's extremely loose. There are all sorts of m2 devices of different sizes, but every NVME M2 drive is the same size.

So technically, you are correct, but practically you are incorrect. If someone said M2 NVME form factor, it's one size.

So technically, you are correct, but practically you are incorrect. If someone said M2 NVME form factor, it's one size.
