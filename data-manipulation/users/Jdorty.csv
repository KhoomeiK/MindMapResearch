pathofexile,ffh20rn,t1_ffgxs4b,1579920981.0,"It isn't 'taking advantage of a shitty system'.   You can do the exact same thing, except price from high to low.  You aren't taking advantage of NPCs, or screwing GGG, or messing up the economy.  It's being obnoxious to other *actual people*.

People who constantly price low and slowly raise the price can fuck themselves."
pathofexile,ffgwxm8,t1_ffgiua9,1579917160.0,"Sure I can blame him.  There are plenty of shitty things people can do in real life without getting in trouble and I blame them for it.

As a whole you have to blame the 'system' (GGG) for not having a better system or proper boundaries.  

On an individual basis, however, you can still blame a person for being a fuck of a human."
pathofexile,ff9ki7r,t1_ff9i74c,1579714927.0,The reason most of the categories are trade/crafting supplies is *because* most items are BoE or BoP.  Majority of the time in WoW the best items can't be crafted or traded.  That's completely the opposite of PoE.

pathofexile,ff3sidw,t1_ff3dkis,1579547900.0,"There's nothing wrong with haggling as long as you ask up front and don't use a douche reason like ""discount for waiting"".

I have absolutely no problem with someone sending a buy message and immediately following up with an offer for a bit less.  I usually accept if the item has been up for a bit."
pathofexile,ff04lz4,t1_fetbxfn,1579465170.0,"It's not even that.  The people responding about never having slow down have almost certainly never done high IIQ and monster pack t16 maps with beyond, shrines, etc.  A huge portion of the community don't even get to high tier maps.

Then they have the need to respond on reddit as if they know what's going on."
pathofexile,felxqzi,t1_felura8,1579233610.0,"You should be able to use a chaotic resonator on an item with suffixes cannot be changed.  It works the same as using a chaos orb.  It should reroll all the prefixes (*including* suffixes cannot be changed), and leave the suffixes.  It's expensive, giving you one reroll on prefixes for 2 ex."
pathofexile,felnyff,t1_felgznz,1579226718.0,All three good rolls are suffixes so you can craft suffixes cannot be changed and fossil craft or do whatever with it.  Can do that as many times as you want.  Can also check poe db to see if any of the conqueror exalts have desirable prefix mods.
pathofexile,feg4pme,t1_feg06iv,1579076808.0,"It's on official and poe.trade.  You use it to list a set of modifiers and to only show items with at least X amount of modifiers you specify.  Works well in conjunction with the 'And' mods.  Can set the And mods to something like life and pseudo total resists, then have a few mods in a Count function and say it has to have 1-2 of them.

Decent for searching jewels too.  Put life under 'And', then a set of like 5 mods under 'Count' and set it to a minimum of 2 mods."
pathofexile,fefgene,t1_fef3mra,1579055775.0,"It's super easy for just life and res...  just search stygian vise, only need two mods: explicit maximum life minimum 71 and pseudo +total resistance. 

Should literally take 15 seconds to check."
pathofexile,feepgkt,t1_fecrqmb,1579038468.0,"There is a discord with a crafting and services section.  I'm on mobile so I don't have my discord channels, but I'm sure it would come up if you google poe discord services.  Probably some of the global channels in game too.  Don't remember if #840 is just Niko or all stuff?"
pathofexile,feeos68,t1_feebsjw,1579038076.0,"Yes, it takes a long time.  I generally only do the level reset 20% quality recipe on my first set of gems, or gems I'm leveling in my offhand weapons.  Once I'm late game and buying different gems or a new build and have some currency I just buy quality gems (or use gem cutters on them if that's cheaper)."
pathofexile,fedybu7,t1_feduvgn,1579022469.0,"I have also never been scammed.  I've also never had a problem buying or selling big ticket items.  My problem comes in when wanting to buy or sell a bunch of currency, fragments, maps, etc.

It 100% is needlessly tedious.  You're taking one small portion of the argument (scamming) and turning it into the entire argument.  I wish people wouldn't even mention scamming in these posts, as it derails the discussion and actual problems and people latch on to that one aspect."
pathofexile,fed0vec,t1_fec8nhr,1578993067.0,"What a stupid line of reasoning.

What's more important, curing cancer or treating minor illnesses?  Guess all doctors should stop what they're doing and help cure cancer."
pathofexile,feczzi7,t1_fecth3p,1578991832.0,"Even in the wiki it's confusing.  I had no idea what to do with talismans, so I checked the wiki a few months ago:

> A crafting bench in the Syndicate Research station can transform a non-corrupted amulet into a **random talisman** if Jorgin was stationed there

Not very informative.  I just assumed it turned an amulet into one of the shitty talismans I saw dropping everywhere."
pathofexile,feczv3s,t1_fecs0ir,1578991666.0,"But a huge majority of them are.  Like, I was running an SRS build that had zombies and wasn't Baron, but that wouldn't want this item as much, as the focus is SRS.

Like 99% of the builds on poe.ninja, where zombies are the actual focus (who would want +2 zombies), are The Baron."
pathofexile,feacajt,t1_fe7yeep,1578946922.0,Same.  Messed up one of mine and now keep it on notepad.
todayilearned,fdgqsc4,t1_fdgooxh,1578405891.0,"Yes, it is.  It isn't a federal law, but it's illegal in most states, and I think illegal in *every* state if it can be proven to be be lewd or sexual in nature."
todayilearned,fdghirl,t1_fdfojll,1578397040.0,"It has to be something added in to the cost.  A jar of over 160 olives is under $4.  That makes $40,000 in olives come out to over 1.6 million olives.  We're setting records for amount of flights per year, at like 850 million a year.  You're telling me that years ago, when this example took place, *one* airline was serving over 1.6 million salads a year?  And this is being generous, as these businesses buying in bulk get discounts as well. 

The estimated savings have to be coming from more than just the literal price of olives."
todayilearned,fcrkehy,t1_fcrjptf,1577902969.0,"Sportsmanship refers to being fair and being accepting or generous in victory or defeat.  What you're describing is competitiveness, not sportsmanship."
Cosmere,faqfvmd,t1_fapwu2s,1576302475.0,"Spren *did* exist pre-shattering.  Just not all in the form they're in now.  Been confirmed in WoB, along with high storms.

There wouldn't have been the same intelligent spren from Honor and Cultivation, but there were either different spren and/or the 'forces' spren (flamespren, rotspren, things like that)."
