That said — I’m not particularly awesome at math, and other than a baseline for other knowledge, physics isn’t directly useful to me. 

I have a hands-on job, talking to people, taking photos, fixing problems... but I also use CAD daily, and the manufacturing classes I took, and fifteen years of experience. Much of what you’ll use in your job ends up being info you learn as you go. But a lot of it comes in little snippets from your coursework, too. 

Do you like solving problems? Engineering comes down to problem-solving. I’m not trying to be a smartass; my jobs have always been related to solving a set of problems related to the industry I’ve been in. (Roofing mfg, rapid-prototyping polymers, equipment manufacturing, weird developmental uninterruptible power supplies, semiconductor stuff... lots of industries). And the engineering skills, and fixing problems — it’s been a little surprising how all of it is similar, while being very different in some ways.

Engineering problem solving, in my case, has always been “look at the situation we have, collect information, and fix this.”  

And I love that problem solving thing, and that my day is different most of the time, personally. But if you’re starting to realize you _don’t_ love that, specifically... see how you can apply your interests to a major that better fits your skills and interests."

AskEngineers,ffca6bm,t1_ffc6k21,1579795027.0,"In my current job, the manufacturing engineers are helping the engineering technicians improve the process of assembly. There are improvements in the methods used to assemble our systems, for example. 

Some of my job is also to deal with the mismatch in real-world issues vs the theoretical “well, it worked fine in the CAD model!” problems — often the CAD design is working from the assumption that everything is going to be perfect — and clearly that’s not always the case. 

Applying manufacturing engineering principles to real-world stuff is making improvements. Improving designs or processes to allow the original intent to still happen, while also being realistic in what’s achievable and reasonable, too. 

This has applied when I was a manufacturing engineer at a roofing plant, and the same thing at a semiconductor-industry plant. Things can always be improved, and finding the places where it makes sense to improve it is the challenge. 

Some changes take a long time to pay off, and some don’t. Once I worked on a roofing-manufacturing efficiency, and the yearly efficiency improvement they wanted to see was so good that it paid for itself in the first day. The reprogramming cost was so useful that the increased productivity paid the cost in the first day. 

Some changes eliminate waste, and the payoff takes time to achieve. I had a project elsewhere at the roofing plant that eliminated a waste stream costing ~$350 a day, but the system to fix it cost about $20000, so it took documentation and research to justify to management. It still works, five years later, and they use it five or six days a week. The system was paid for by the offset of the waste in about 9 months, so it’s saved them about 400,000 bucks in the years since we put it in. 

Little change, massive impact. I should have suggested they pay me a $10/day royalty for the system. Alas, no such luck."

If you’re adding heat energy to the ice that’s being absorbed by the cold concrete under the ice, it’ll take significantly more energy to raise the temperature to a point that the ice melts.

Not to oversimplify, but...Have you considered shattering the ice periodically, and shoveling it out?"

It’s for winding out specific lengths of wire, putting them in a neat coil, and allowing them to be easily removed. You’re missing the central pivot and the distance meter."
HelpMeFind,feflkhh,t1_fefinq2,1579058920.0,"I would check on the warranty from Kohler; often brands have crazy warranties. For example: we had a shower diverter (use either the main shower or a hand wand, right) made by Delta, and it had a gasket that got cut inside the action. Delta warranted it _forever_, regardless of why it failed — and they sent us a new one, no questions asked. Crazy warranty."

Water bottles like that one are made by clamping  a preformed plastic tube into a mold, softening that tube with heat, and then inflating that softened tube with air to take the shape of the mold. 

Lots of trouble for an inexpensive bottle, plus you’d have to have the mold."

DETAILS ALL MATTER.  You’re asking for very, very specific results. You’re being exceedingly vague. Those two things are incompatible.

machining,fe00sdf,t1_fdzzt1e,1578800307.0,"Lapping is the process you’re going to need to approach the flatness you’re looking for. That requires, at minimum, the right compound (usually some grit suspended in an oil, I think), a granite plate, and the correct plan. 

I’ve seen a lot of stuff lapped for flatness, and most of the time it requires a specific machine designed to use lapping compound and also run the items in a planetary pattern to maximize the effect. 

The flatness was checked with an optical flat and a polarized helium light source, showing the bands of wavelengths of helium (in tiny little fractions of an inch of variation) to show how flat it was. This was a professional setup for lapping already-polished mechanical-seal seat surfaces made out of polished tungsten carbide or silicon carbide. 

Your lack of any specific details makes me think you don’t have the right plan. 

It’s gonna be really difficult (approaching impossible, probably) for you to achieve any level of flatness that approaches what you’re referring to with a hand-polishing process."

Using the shifting of light wavelengths, they can tell that parts of it are moving away from our location. We’re not (hah) the center of the universe, so that movement of other objects changes the wavelengths of light, actually changing white light to look more red— longer wavelengths, moving away, or more blue — shorter wavelengths, moving closer to us. 

(red shift and [blue shift](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueshift) are the terms for that.
