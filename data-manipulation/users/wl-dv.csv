AmItheAsshole,ff9mkal,t1_ff9ltq2,1579716138.0,"Side note, ask your dad if he would allow you a little leeway; say something like “*pops I care about you and keeping your home clean, but sometimes I can’t do it right away. I promise I’ll always get it done but it will take me a little longer. Is that okay? I want to make sure I don’t disrupt your routine by living here, but sometimes I do need a little more time.*” 

Tell him you love him and appreciate him and that you have a lot on your plate. 

Sometimes opening up a little bit of yourself to someone will give them a softer approach to you and your reactions/actions.

Plus if he knows what you have on your plate ALONG WITH how it’s affecting you, he might try to take himself off your plate."

Either way, tell her you’d like to be apart of her support system. Tell her you don’t feel right leaving her to deal with this alone. 

Tell her you want to be a distraction from the shit of her past, be her future. 

If you two have a good connection and a spark, don’t let it die because *some guy* (might have) told her “you drug me through your mental health shit and now I resent you!” 

Be the guy she needs and you two will have a beautiful relationship."

Break up with her Pronto! Give her a reason, write it out if it’s easier or just sit her down and tell her how you’ve been feeling and how shitty you’ve felt being her friend. Then tell her “our friendship isn’t worth the amount of emotional pain you put me through; you don’t think about other people when you make decisions, and the only reason you asked me about joe is because you think I’m a push over and I’d give in to you.”

relationship_advice,ff0ynf7,t3_er3h95,1579473566.0,"Some women get bored and you being, as you described, not very attractive, gives the women the idea that you’ll go for them because “*why wouldn’t he? Look at him and then look at me!*” 

You’re, in their eyes, an easy shmuck; they can spend some time with you without having to commit any part of themselves because you’ll ““*Let Them Walk All Over You*””

The easiest way to deal with this is to simply *Not Give A Fuck*. Flirt, have fun, but never ask them out. Lead them on, and make them go crazy for you. Treat them with respect and be nice, but don’t expect anything until they put themselves on the line for your affection/attention. 

You’ll likely never get away from women like this, but don’t stoop to their level by playing into their ruse. Just live in the moment and forget about them when you walk away. Act like you barely know them or think about them when you see them and just leave it at that. 

If they’re actually into you and want to see what you two could become They Will Come And Say That. Women have way more balls than people assume.

The more you try to help them the worse they get. They feed off the attention and if you stop giving it to them they will do whatever it takes to get it back. 

They won’t get better until they want to. You can’t force them to heal, only they can. 

Tell her she’s unhealthy, that she’s misguided and going down a bad path, and that you won’t sit idly by and watch her do this. Tell her it’s bad for your mental health to be apart of a relationship that she only wants when it’s fun and means nothing."
relationship_advice,feoh5i6,t3_eq7cva,1579300027.0,"Well, to be honest, when you and a significant other have different views of the norm, in the relationship or out of the relationship, it takes a lot of effort to meet in the middle. If that is even an option, it takes a huge amount of trust and communication to be able to withstand the changes to your personal views, and waiting for the other person to change their personal views. 

In most cases, going out of your comfort zone to see things the way they do, or them doing the same for you, creates tension, and a lot of uncomfortable topics that the two of you will *really* have to work through. 

Try to show him how you feel, I know your being distant is working to show him that you’re upset and not sure how to deal with the situation, but you could also try and show him how close you want to be with him. 

Watch a movie (romcom) where the main characters are best friends that fall in love. 

Tell him that this is how you view a healthy relationship; don’t bring up your views on this situation being a problem between his friend and himself; allow that to be unspoken, it will show, but if you say “oh but that’s not how I feel about you and friend” he will still think that and become guarded on that topic and his relationship with her. He will likely become withdrawn. 

If the two of you have a good connection that feels like you’re walking on clouds and breathing fire in bed, then working through it will be the way to go. If you two just like each other and work well together, you’ll have to rely on him actually wanting to put in work. He may not ever put in the same work as you do, which will create tension now, or later down the road if you feel like you’re the only person trying to hold together the relationship. The same tension will be created if you’re the only person changing. You’ll feel like you lost yourself to this man and he did not sacrifice any part of his “comfort zone” to you. 

Hope this helps. 

*P.S my husband and I have the fire breathing- cloud walking connection, so don’t think you’ll never find it, and never settle until you have someone who puts the same work into the relationship as you have, or do*

*Listen to red flag, gut feelings, and don’t stay with someone who upsets you because of their own ignorance to your happiness*"

When asked “can I do this?” 
Do you think, “*they are asking me my opinion on this, how do I feel about this? Oh I should tell them that*” 

Saying “Do What You Please” IS SO PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE. like “*I’ll get mad that you don’t choose me in every situation! But I’ll let you choose how mad I am at you, until of course I break up with you because you don’t choose me enough!!*” EVEN THOUGH you blatantly DON’T CARE. 

Make What You Want Known. try saying “*I want you to go snowboarding the day After the SF trip so we can do both this weekend, and you won’t be sore when you spend time with me.*” 
If his friend doesn’t want to reschedule a Day out and your bf still chooses to go, TELL HIM that it hurts your feelings, but you’re not mad.
