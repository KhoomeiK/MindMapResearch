PS4,ffimeg6,t1_ffhonj2,1579977354.0,27% is actually huge. You remove the PlayStation and don’t struggles to stay afloat. You take away the xbox from Microsoft and they still thrive as a top business.
xboxone,fffub17,t1_ffftjze,1579891952.0,I actually had fun on anthem for a while. It wasn’t as bad as people made it out to be.
xbox,ff87guw,t3_ervzd5,1579668181.0,I’ll pay you for it
aww,ff5cbtj,t3_ernnsn,1579587073.0,So this violates rule 1 of this subreddit
memes,ff53ghq,t1_ff4qyob,1579579184.0,Air traffic controller here! We actually have as part of our jobs to navigate around storms but are still responsible for keeping the route as short as possible so we fly right up to the edge then turn them around it.
CODZombies,ff1be1q,t3_er2t51,1579477124.0,I was lucky enough to get the collectors edition on launch night and I adore the fridge
GrandTheftAutoV,fes44xb,t1_ferxymk,1579361206.0,When the game first came out you could only do character missions which paid 7k at most. It was hours and hours of missions and robbing stores. Doing the old heists now still only gives a couple hundred grand so back then that still wasn’t much and was a grind. You also lost 10k or something every time you died when the game first came out.
avengedsevenfold,fep2gih,t1_feotg3c,1579310645.0,I have the vinyl but never took it out of the wrapping so I’m very excited
avengedsevenfold,fems8hd,t3_epvu39,1579268130.0,I’ve never listened to DITR so this is like a new album all together for me.
modernwarfare,fem2cc7,t3_epsrek,1579237458.0,I had a game on shoothouse where I had 20 captured and the next highest was 3. It’s so annoying

xbox,fdy9r8q,t1_fdxdtu6,1578777538.0,Save it for them. I remember busting out my dads old Atari and loving to mess around with it and compare it to today’s games.

modernwarfare,fdr0vwr,t1_fdqe9el,1578677969.0,Bro don’t act like PS players aren’t also toxic. It’s not a system thing. It’s a community thing.
modernwarfare,fdp0vac,t1_fdos8sz,1578617341.0,They have had doubt Xp tokens in the past ( see mw3 and other doritios promotions) that only use it in game so they know how to do it
ATC,fdl48dx,t1_fdl29k8,1578516775.0,Very true. My bad for poor word choice. Also with the new reform act passed who knows how the next bid will be.
ATC,fdl1avs,t3_elxyom,1578515314.0,So every bid has two pools. Pool 1 is for the CTI people like you said and pool 2 is just off the street people. To apply to pool 2 you just need 3 years of work experience which you have. If you meet the requirements you will take the test called the AT-SA and based on your score you will either get hired or not. You do not need the CTI. The bid opens up on January 24 on USA jobs so before then head over there and make an account and use their resume builder because it asks for everything they are looking for. Do not submit your own resume. Good luck!
FortNiteBR,fdklmz0,t1_fdki8e4,1578506105.0,Imagine being a troll in 2020. Don’t worry buddy. You’ll grow up one day.
CallOfDuty,fdhtwez,t1_fdhtuif,1578430073.0,That’s acceptable. But when they have A and B and you have 0 capture for the whole match I get angry haha
CallOfDuty,fdhpcy2,t3_elc6gh,1578427493.0,I’ll admit it. I kill my teammates that camp the whole game and don’t play the objective.
memes,fd0jpsz,t1_fczt24w,1578119804.0,Oh boy. Then you haven’t checked Twitter where it’s a cesspool of people saying world war 3 is imminent.
modernwarfare,fcoqxny,t1_fcoqw8e,1577839176.0,That’s solid! You got the double threat!
modernwarfare,fcok67z,t1_fcofeuz,1577834279.0,Strict objective playing for me to a 2.05 win/lose with a .99 k/d haha

aww,fcjm7sw,t3_ehhj00,1577693508.0,u/finestjun
ATC,fc5ibas,t1_fc5i8ak,1577458382.0,The interpretation of the bill is shotty as some see it as it gives more preference to Pool 1 and there will be more of them hired. The bill seems to have removed the 10% rule so no one knows who that will benefit if anyone.
movies,fc3ygpu,t3_eg041n,1577401881.0,He scored the main intro song to call of duty Black Ops 2. Its all downhill from there.
