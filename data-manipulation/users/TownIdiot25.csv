UnethicalLifeProTips,ffj5ti5,t1_ffj5q3j,1579991136.0,If I knew how to do it without it basically (and literally) falling in my lap like that I’d be having a much easier time right now.
UnethicalLifeProTips,ffj5ddg,t1_ffj53wp,1579990818.0,The tactics I used was she needed a work shirt and I had one that was too small for me so SHE asked to come over to my house and pick it up then we ordered pizza and then fucked like rabbits for a few months. She eventually said that me being in a position over her was just a fetish so it kinda died down once she no longer worked under me.
UnethicalLifeProTips,ffiflts,t1_ffi90q1,1579972703.0,Only if you get caught. I slept with my seasonal all the time and we only hid it from my boss until after seasonal hires were let go at that point my boss found out and didn't give a shit because it was too late now.
theydidthemath,fetll1p,t1_fetl3r7,1579376632.0,"> There comes a point where race influences how I judge a person, both on a factual basis and because of stereotypes loosely fueled by statistics.  There also comes a point where I judge someone primarily due to race.  Based on my moral code, I do not believe it is possible to be both a black and a good person.

> Also, this is a value judgement, not a statement in fact.  You can't ""prove"" me wrong you can only prove we have different values.

How does that sound? There is a reason you are not supposed to judge someone based on: race, sexuality, financial status, disability, or religion. How about you simply know someone before you hate on them."
theydidthemath,fet218i,t1_fesz3tj,1579371083.0,"My point is that you shouldn't judge someone just becasue of their wealth. Hate someone because they are a bad person not because of their money.

I could be full of shit, my dad could be a doctor who paid for medical school by scamming charities and then only works to keep people dying because it is more profitable for him. You don't know that, you just know he is a doctor therefore he must be good. And person X is a car dealer so they must be bad. You shouldn't judge people just because of where they are financially."
theydidthemath,fesuvik,t1_fessid2,1579369225.0,"Thats just generalizing though. Not every person who is rich and successful got there like Paris Hilton, including people in Jobs you may not like. Some people worked for it. Bill Gates worked from a garage. Elon Musk started out putting in literally all the money he had into Zip2. 

Who is to say that just because you don’t like a particular car dealer owner that he didn’t work to that spot? Or if he inherited it from his parents even, how do you know that THEY didn’t work from absolute scratch?

It is literally every person’s goal to be at a point where you can get a lot of money for little work. But it is extremely unlikely you will get there without putting in a shitload of work to get to that point."
theydidthemath,fesqzm2,t1_feslg41,1579368085.0,"My dad is an emergency doctor who worked from literal poverty to where he is today, and just barely meets the “1%” mark so he is treated like absolute shit for being successful."

TheOrville,fefra8n,t1_fedo3zs,1579062911.0,"I just imagine it would also be a bad publicity stunt if NBC forced him to cancel Family Guy, the show that basically gave him his name and is probably one of the the most popular animated shows of all time.

TumblrInAction,fdwc4s5,t3_en061q,1578757211.0,Here is a fun game: tell a trans woman you are attracted to her BECAUSE she has a penis. Say it is no different than being attracted to someone because they have blue eyes. Watch how they call you transphobic and/or gay.

AskReddit,fctg8pc,t3_eit66t,1577942277.0,"in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans. Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3""03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat + high HP pool + Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more."
AskReddit,fctg4f2,t1_fctfqja,1577942169.0,"Also Detective Pikachu showed that Ditto can replicate basically any creature it knows about, or even create people out of thin air like the janitor on the TV set at the beginning. If your ditto is aware of who Margot Robbie is, you could most likely tell it to turn into Margot Robbie and it could do it without a photo. The eyes would still be creepy but some sunglasses or just going doggy style would fix that."
