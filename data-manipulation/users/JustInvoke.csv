Good example is American television sometimes have scenes where a white american speaks slowly to a foreigner for them to understand. While on the other end, you would never see a Korean speaking to a foreigner in Korean occur in any Korean movie/drama scene.

It's simply ignorance due to lack of experience compared to Americans and you should have the balls enough to bring awareness to the koreans you come across if it bothers you."

This is the difference between you and I. I've actually talk to many Trump supporters about voting for Bernie if he ran instead of Hillary. Idk how many you've talked to but you sound like you have. But we can agree that we disagree.
