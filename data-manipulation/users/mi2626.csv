IdiotsInCars,fgh1ui1,t3_ey7jj8,1580774692.0,Yeah saw someone watching a basketball game whilst driving on the freeway before.... almost as bad as bad as looking over and seeing a woman playing on her iPad on the freeway.
IdiotsInCars,fggv0ag,t3_eyaws6,1580770174.0,In what world would anyone think that this is a good idea?? You’d have to rationalize how dangerous that is. Honestly I get they want to share the road and whatever and this is probably an unpopular opinion but I fucking hate bikers in the road. Making me drive 5 mph because they want to ride in a one lane and I can’t safely pass. Like just go to the sidewalk or find a bike trail.
YouShouldKnow,fg7a5lr,t1_fg5ui43,1580587594.0,Get a dash cam that records the inside of your car.
JUSTNOMIL,fg79ksk,t3_ex62hl,1580587203.0,That’s awful. I’m so sorry. My sister was unable to breastfeed and it’s shocking how many people ask if you’re breastfeeding. Your MIL sounds god awful.
ntbdbiwdfta,fg798qm,t3_ex7hnw,1580586980.0,LOVE HIMMMM. I wanna tuck him in and read him a story.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fg77779,t1_ffzj7vp,1580585604.0,His plan: get all the treaties and go on all the walks.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fg7763i,t1_ffxc6d4,1580585584.0,If I tell him to say please he puts his hands together but if I say “clap your hands” he moves them together over and over.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fg76zy8,t1_ffx2aj8,1580585470.0,I’m actually not positive! I just had someone ask if he was a rat terrier last week! I adopted him and only know the mom was a chihuahua but she was adopted so... hahah I’m sure he has rat terrier in there somewhere.

Wellthatsucks,fg76mwv,t1_ffx5w2n,1580585231.0,"Oh I know that for sure! But when I think of traveling I think - the Eiffel Tower, Rome, London, all those cool landmarks and rich pieces of culture and history. When I think of traveling in the U.S. I think beach, L.A., etc. There a ton of cool places in the U.S. but I think Europe has us beat on beautiful landmarks. Although living in Michigan, I’m lucky, just a 25 minute drive SE and I’m in Canada."

Wellthatsucks,ffwywgp,t1_ffwxmf8,1580314117.0,It’s weird to me how that seems so far-fetched to us Americans... a trip to Paris is an expensive trip that has to be all planned out. You guys are lucky :(
Wellthatsucks,ffwyqlm,t1_ffwrl1f,1580314015.0,Why though? Like what’s the difference what time you take a picture of it at?

technicallythetruth,ffwx7nn,t1_ffwmyvm,1580313057.0,"My dad accidentally left his open overnight. Around 3 AM he had two police officers ringing his doorbell asking him to shut it. His neighborhood is safe. 

Although the house I lived at when I was younger, my sister and I were having a “sleepover” in the living room. Around 2 AM someone was pounding on the door to get into the house from the attached garage (we normally left the door from the driveway to the garage unlocked). They were pounding like they were being chased by a damn murderer in a horror movie. They stole a few car wash rags from our garage and lit them on fire and put it on our porch. I’m now super adamant on locking all doors to garages, they freak me out."
introverts,ffkf3h5,t1_ffa5ete,1580021720.0,"As I read the post I was thinking, “and that’s why I love Meijer instead of Kroger.” I have a Meijer right down the road from me! It’s almost my favorite store really."

MadeMeSmile,ffbawot,t3_eshh2q,1579757922.0,"As a former self harmer - I’m really proud of you. This means you have let the cuts turn into scars which means they aren’t new. Good on that artist who is willing to be lenient on the cover up work. They must be a fantastic human being for being willing to forgo their income to make someone feel less shame. If you don’t take him up on the offer - remember that your scars tell your story no matter how shitty it is. You put that pain on your soul, but your soul is ready to heal. I know that feeling of addiction and pain all wrapped into one - I know it well - but you are so worth every great thing in life. Stay resilient. Feel free to message me anytime you want or need, for ANYTHING!"

ChoosingBeggars,ff8jl4s,t3_er4kp8,1579681511.0,"You’d have to pay me to have to spend that much time making my horse alone picture ready - have someone stand in front of her to toss dirt or crinkle a peppermint wrapper for her ears, hooking up the trailer, bathing, washing and picking out her tail that drags a good foot on the ground when not wrapped, clipped, hoof polish, clean my tack & polish the silver on the tack. Absolutely no thanks. :’) is this lady ok? I had to pay someone like $200 alone just to get her ready for my senior pics and that wasn’t even going towards the photographer."
AskReddit,ff6rbg6,t3_erstu3,1579633249.0,My game plan is to just hope neither happen at this point

MorbidReality,ff5jy6q,t1_ff4kq4v,1579596441.0,I keep trying to forget that story but it sticks out as probably the worst way to go. If I have tall boots on that I can’t get off I sometimes cry. Or when I was younger and tried on clothes (i have a bigger chest so a medium might be fine everywhere else but not for my chest) and I would get “stuck” in a shirt I would instantly break out in a sweat and basically be ready to dislocate my shoulder to get the fuck out of it. I have vivid memories of being “stuck” in clothing as a kid and crying trying to rip it off of me. So knowingly being stuck - I would just beg someone to give me a fucking lethal dose of meds or shoot me. I physically couldn’t remain calm for any period of time.
nope,ff5gi5m,t3_erjnhh,1579591843.0,There isn’t one part of my that I truly believe could take my own shit in my hands and play with it.
