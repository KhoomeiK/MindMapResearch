Christian,ffe58m7,t3_et35ou,1579837031.0,"Your salvation is not dependent upon whether or not you accept or deny these things about yourself. This is a lie that has infiltrated churches. God's grace is unconditional, you were redeemed when Jesus died. Churches today have made people believe that God's grace is conditional on them being obedient, and this causes fear and more control. Romans 4 talks about grace being unconditional and Galatians talks about it too. Galatians 3 says that God's decision to save us is based on a promise made to Abraham and Jesus, and God doesn't break his promises. 

Of course God's grace being unconditional doesn't mean we have freedom to live however we want. But when you believe that you are saved because of God's unconditional love through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, God fills you with the Holy Spirit and makes you FEEL this love. like physically its the most peaceful thing ever. And the Spirit sets you free from sin. It's almost like a reaction to God's love. 

I don't know if the Spirit will let you accept these things about yourself, but don't believe for a second that these things disqualify you from grace. Focus on this fact and the Spirit will lead you and tell you what to do and who to be"
Christian,ffar0zg,t3_eslbqm,1579742471.0,"God promises eternal life after this one, he does not promise to take away all problems and pain in this one. In fact Jesus promised suffering and persecution for his followers.

The pain you feel comes from people and their sin, not from God. You're right it is part of God's plan for you to feel this hurt. He made this entire plan and knows everything that's going to happen till the very end. But it is all so that we can understand his love. 

You cannot understand what cold water is until you've felt hot water. You can't experience freedom without first being enslaved. And you can't know God's love without feeling pain first. But even though God made the plan, the pain comes from people's sin, not from God. 

Romans 5:19 says the act of one man brings righteousness to all people.

This means nothing we do can change God's decision to save us, cause he already did when Jesus died, his death means the payment for our sins. It's done.

Being saved by faith means trusting that this is true, it is to receive the gift, not a condition to be given it. It's like God opened heavens door and told us all to come in.

Either way, I think it's fun to speculate, but there is nothing to worry about, in fact the end times will be glorious because that is when Jesus will come and take away all suffering and fear. There's no need to panic or warn everyone. Just keep loving people and sharing God's grace with people"

Christianity,ff7sj72,t3_es2jz6,1579657310.0,"I used to be very nihilistic and I saw no purpose in anything in life because it was all meaningless if we all die one day. I realized one day that the only thing that makes me feel fulfilled and good is love. I was an atheist at this point, but decided to read the bible because I knew a lot of the teachings were about love. Then I learned by reading that God's grace is unconditional, and this has changed my life, and God has confirmed it is true to me. 

My perspective on life is this: Everything in this life (and everything that has happened in the bible the way it happened) is so that we can understand God's love. It is impossible to know what hot water is without feeling cold water first. In the same way it is impossible for us to know what freedom is without first being enslaved. God created us knowing we would sin, it's not like he made a mistake and we went against his plan. That was his plan all along. 

Churches today have painted God as this judge that will grant eternal life in heaven if we are good enough. They make his grace conditional on repentance, good works, etc. But the reality of the gospel is that God has already saved us by sacrificing his son. His decision to save us was made by a promise to Abraham back in Genesis. This means that nothing we do can affect his decision to save us. Believing in Jesus and the resurrection is just trusting that this is true, it is receiving grace, it is not a condition to be given grace. It's like God has already opened heaven's gates and invited the whole world in. But if we don't believe, it's like we're convincing ourselves that we are not worthy. 

Jesus had a very nihilistic outlook on life too. He tells us don;t invest in worldly things because everything in this life will pass away, but instead invest in eternal things, because there is life after this one.

God's grace is unconditional. It is given as a result of a promise to Abraham and to Jesus (Galatians 3) which means you can do nothing to earn or lose his grace. Jesus' death paid the price already for your sins. You are justified.

I think there are two main purposes of this life. 1. for us to grow in our faith and understanding of God's perfect love. I think God uses hard times to show us the power of his love. and 2. to love others in the way God loves you. We all serve a purpose in somebody else's life and walk with God.

Humans should have compassion for other humans and we shouldn't let anyone be stuck in their failure, but that doesn't mean it's beneficial to make them our dependents. If we just give people things and don't teach them independence, it's a lose lose. 

Socialists see the wealthy as the problem, in that they think they are to blame for other people's failures and somehow owe them a share of their earnings. I think this thinking makes the wealthy defensive and removes compassion for others more. If wealthy people invested in building up the weak in society, it would actually benefit them MORE. Building up society will create more consumers and create more opportunity for others. But humans can also be selfish and fail to see the value in giving."
Christians,ff455ea,t3_ere249,1579555763.0,"My church has been doing a series on Genesis and went in depth about this. Here's a few of the sermons below. For me the importance of this whole story isn't about what Abraham does, but about what God does. God gives Abraham a promise of a son, and instead of trusting that God will keep his promise, he tries to make God's promise happen by figuring it out himself, so he has the baby with Hagar. This is a result of a lack of understanding of how God keeps his promises. Also note that this was before the law was introduced, so to Abraham, there was no sin. So in a sense nothing was wrong to Abraham. His fears of Abimelech was justified because that was a very real thing back then, it was like the wild wild west out there. If a king wanted to kill you, he could just do it and take your wife. 

But one point of this story is to show how God builds up Abraham's faith by being faithful to his promise and the result of Abraham's actions for not trusting God. He used this to build up Abraham's faith, not to test it. God builds up his faith to the point that he was willing to sacrifice this son he had been waiting for to God, and that was all the result of what God did to show he was faithful.

Imagine you are in a courtroom. You are the defendant with Jesus as your lawyer. Satan is the accuser and God is the judge. Satan says ""he owes me his life"" then the judge says, ""well I love him so much, I'll give you Jesus' life instead"" so Jesus gives up his life. Then the judge says to you ""you are free to go""
In that scenario you didn't do anything to earn the sacrifice, the judge did it as a free gift to you, to save you. Now if you believe that the sacrifice was made, and that your debt was paid, you would walk out of the courtroom as a free man. But if you say, no I must be circumsized before I am forgiven, you are not trusting that the sacrifice is a gift. You're trying to earn it. This is why it says when you try to follow the law, you are condemning yourself. Even though the judge said you are free, you hold yourself as still guilty.

Then the judge says ""I love him so much, I will give you the life of my son, Jesus in his place."" So Jesus gives up his life. Then the judge says to you ""You are free to go"".  Believing that circumcision or any kind of work is required for salvation would be like saying, ""But God I can't accept that sacrifice because I am not circumcised."" The judge made the sacrifice as a free gift to you, not dependent upon anything you did, because he loves you, and by adding works, you're saying another step needs to be taken to be saved or to earn the sacrifice. If you believed that the sacrifice was enough, you would walk out of the courtroom with freedom. But because you add works to it, you keep yourself condemned."

I left that church and became an atheist for 6 years and there wasn't a person in the world that could convince me God existed. What made the difference to me was people loving me. I sought out more because I knew there was more to this love. 

So yeah i think its more important to love others than it is to preach to them. And I think the Spirit will tell you when to invite people."

They are controlled by fear. This was a terrible thing to say, but try not to take it personally. They are blind to the truth, and yeah it reflects their hearts, not yours. 

The ICOC and COC don't understand what it means to be saved by faith. They add things to grace. This diminishes what Christ already did and introduces fear. I would recommend leaving the ICOC or at least studying out what it means to be saved by faith. the entire letter of Galatians talks about this when that church added circumcision as a requirement to be saved. Adding anything to grace completely separates you from Christ. I'de love to talk about this with you if you want"

This means that you no longer have to try and receive salvation by obeying the law. Rather you have confidence that you are forgiven because of what Jesus did, not because of anything you did to earn it. This is because of God's unconditional love.

Repentance is the result of being saved. Romans 7 and 8 talks about this, us being set free from our sinful nature, which only comes by the power of the Holy Spirit. 

We receive the Holy Spirit when we believe that Jesus is the Son of God and that he was offered as a sacrifice for our sins and he is resurrected. This is clear in Acts 10 with Cornelius's household.

Christianity,fdfn2xt,t3_el0ofq,1578365507.0,"Christianity is the only way because there is only one creator. It is the only way because it is how God offers forgiveness.

The idea of forgiveness is interesting, because before Jesus, there was the law. So one law is do not steal. If you steal, you will be condemned, if you obey you will be saved. But the problem is, nobody could keep the law, everyone broke it. So forgiveness is received by belief in Jesus. So whether or not I decided to steal does not affect whether or not I am saved. There is now a new freedom because I am not longer justified by what I do, but instead by God's grace. But this does not give me the freedom to steal. Stealing is still sinful, but when God gives you the Holy Spirit, the desire to steal goes away.

A person is not condemned for being gay, they are saved through faith regardless if they are gay. Whether or not it is okay for them to have sexual relations with the same sex I don't know, but I know the Holy Spirit will convict them.

Additionally I don't believe anyone will go to hell. In the old testament, when people sinned, animals would be sacrificed as an atonement or payment for sins. God (the Father) sacrificed his own son as an atonement for our sins, meaning our sins are paid for. But forgiveness and atonement are two separate things. We receive eternal life in heaven through forgiveness. But I believe all people's sins are paid for already because of Jesus' death.

I don't know what happens to people who have never heard of Jesus, but I know God is just and does not condemn someone for the circumstances he put them in"

There is a difference between forgiveness and atonement. In the OT animal sacrifice was used for atonement or payment for sin. A death for a life. God sacrificed Jesus as an atonement for our sins. Meaning our sins are paid for. A death for a life.

But we are saved by forgiveness, meaning we receive eternal life in heaven by grace through faith in what Jesus' sacrifice did for us. 

So I believe this to mean that everyone is saved from eternal hell because of atonement, but only those who are forgiven through faith will enter heaven"

The son goes off and squanders his inheritance and becomes so low in life he is willing to dine with the pigs. He decides to return to his father and offer himself as a servant, but his father runs out to him and greets him with love and forgiveness.

Before Jesus, God was on the pedestal, and humans had to follow the law and be 'good' enough to make it. Which was impossible because of our sin.

That expectation is no longer there. Now we may approach God, even at our lowest point in life, and He will extend his grace because he loves us unconditionally. You see God came down to us, we don't have to climb up to him"
