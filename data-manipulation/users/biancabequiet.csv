bulletjournal,feegb27,t3_eo2l8y,1579033164.0,Nice!! I used to kind of do this when I was in college because I also couldn't commit to a whole notepad (just not as thorough and organized as yours of course haha) and it was such a lifesaver!

bulletjournal,fcawzrv,t1_fc8ztne,1577578272.0,Ah got it! I started doing the media to look into for each month but I realize it’s definitely a better idea to have one for the whole year instead of searching for it in the pages
bulletjournal,fcawww4,t1_fc896ih,1577578226.0,Thanks! I was playing around with the idea of a cleaning page. do you have it as a checklist/tracker or more of like a log for when you actually clean?
