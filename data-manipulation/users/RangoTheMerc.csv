But on his own, I do believe he warrants buffs at least for hit connectability. He has the damage build and the kill options. But his mobility, lack of strong aerial game, and opponents escaping combos and specials put me off right now.

As you said, it's only been 1 month. Players like yourself see him incredibly viable while I feel less optimistic. We can probably continue debating over it, but I'm partial to seeing what happens in the future if Riddles can maintain or if anyone else (Locus, Tsu) gets results.

Keep in mind people were still over the moon for Incineroar, Ganondorf, and Belmonts for a while until everyone settled for them being low tier, with Belmonts in mid. I knew all along they weren't viable, which is why I see Terry in that same light. 

But he does have the punish game, so we'll see."
smashbros,fdmdezc,t1_fdlz6l3,1578546321.0,">Okay. You can check [literally](https://ultimateframedata.com/terry.php) any [source](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16fmsoqDoQaR1eteVk2uuzIH2DB4iQHVrqiG8VRbRA7Q/edit#gid=785606057) for frame data and it will tell you that he has 11 frames of invincibility on it. And if you insist that you somehow know better than everybody who recorded the character's frame data, better than the in-game training mode that shows you the invincibility, and even [Sakurai himself](https://youtu.be/yK3VltKv3JI?t=794), here's a [video of Terry's Rising Tackle going straight through Lucina's counter](https://gfycat.com/snivelinginfatuateddoe). you keep telling people to lab it, but man if you just labbed it for five seconds yourself literally everything would tell you that the move has invincibility. 11 frames, to be exact.

Alright, fine. I'm done arguing that point right now. I do not know how or why a Lucina I faced hit me with Counter \*twice\* when I recovered with input RT. I'll lab it myself if I have to. But I'm not touching this subject again until I do.

Edit: Here's my [proof](https://twitter.com/RangoSSB/status/1215144427993231361?s=20).

>He kinda does in this case, since it only whiffs if he's standing right at the very tip of the ledge. All the Terry player has to do is make sure he stands a step or two away from the ledge instead of RIGHT on top of it. The shotos have a similar issue and that issue can easily be remedied. Ergo, his strongest kill option without his SSMs is still usable.

But if your opponent is still there, you have that same issue. Sure, you could probably convert from DTilt, but it doesn't guarantee the whole move will connect. But I will also concede that it's somewhat more reliable than being right on the ledge.

However, either way, it shouldn't cause misses to begin with, period. I feel that's a major flaw that keeps Terry from being reliable as a result.

>It kills Mario at 100% on the ledge with optimal DI.

True. I've labbed SSMs on Mario myself, so that is completely true. Moving on.

>How so? 'Cuz you definitely can't SDI it like you can heavy Power Dunk.

If I can find any replays where this happened, I'll be sure to share them. But I've had my share of people escaping the light version more than once, away from the ledge.

>I find it to be very consistent, it beats low-damage energy projectiles 100% of the time and typically loses to anything else.

8% threshold, said to start on Frame 1. Yet I frequently get hit out of it on startup.

>You're jumping the gun big-time here. We've only ever seen someone escape it once, and y'all are assuming that every character with frame 1 escape tools can get out of it free every time? I just labbed this shit out myself and I can't find any situation where Pac-Man can up B out of Buster Wolf, escaping Buster Wolf is definitely not consistent at all. Actually upon re-watching the clip I know EXACTLY what happened- Pac used up B just before the Buster Wolf connected with him, which left the trampoline on the ground next to Terry. When the Buster Wolf connected with Pac-Man, the animation pulled Pac into the trampoline, causing him to bounce out of the move. So basically, that means Pac can only escape if Terry uses an untrue combo into Buster Wolf. It hurts his hitconfirms a little, but he still has true combo options into Buster Wolf that can prevent escape.

I want to see what happens for anyone else who has a 1-frame Up B. Otherwise, your reasoning is sound here, especially since Pac-Man is a unique case.

>It's got comparable horizontal range than Mario's up B, so I'd say the horizontal hitbox is big enough. Couple that with having an invincible version of the move as an option and I'd say it's a plenty good oos option.

I don't believe I'm mistaken when I say Mario still has more range, as well as a 3 frame startup. Holding down for the input charge RT is an option, albeit one that's inconvenient due to the split-second nature of attempting to punish on shield asap. But again, space out options and you can get away with shield punishes for free.

>The point is that it may have poor range, but it has outrageous reward on hit.

In other words, risk/reward here. It's \*an\* option, just not a heavily ranged one like some others. We can leave that one alone.

>There are ways to turn around and bair without doing a RAR, though. Attack Cancel comes to mind.

Fair. Still inconvenient, but fair.

>""Rising Tackle doesn't have invincibility""

Well aware. I watched the presentation when Terry was released, for the record.

>And that's why you mix up your recovery offstage. None of his recovery moves are unusually punishable or anything. Hell, he definitely has a better recovery than the shotos, and likely a better recovery than characters like Wolf.

I dispute that for several reasons. One, Shoryukens tend to hit a little further horizontally or even through the stage. Secondly, they snap. Third, Tatsus (Side B) have fairly large hitboxes and can be angled depending on if you're ascending or descending.

As for Wolf, that really depends. Side B and Up B both can get 2-framed. Up B also goes a pathetic distance. Side B can be mixed up though. I'm not sure I can really compare Terry's to Wolf's, as I feel the shotos are a more reliable comparison here due to their similar nature.

>I would say Power Wave more than makes up for the discrepancy in range, it's a solid fireball and disjointed hitbox in the air that allows him to poke, approach, and also run a basic zoning game if necessary.

It mildly helps his approach game, but only if he can successfully mix it in, as opposed to Ganondorf out-ranging an enemy. It feels conditional, to say the least.

>I don't totally disagree with you here, but I don't think losing to zoners is enough to make a character bad. Especially since he more than makes up for any damage taken twying to get in with his downright reidiculous damage output (second only to the shotos). He also has a fantastic punish game so any mistake in your zoning could be very costly.

This feels conditional. Heavily conditional. Reason being is you can use that logic for a zoner main playing incredibly well.

As it stands, Terry does have a fantastic punish game up close. You can build to 100% within three Super Special Moves or four Power Dunk combos. That much is true.

Unfortunately, I feel the crux here is that the more people know those weaknesses, the larger the gap they will create between Terry and viable tier status. While his entire moveset and concept are amazing, I find his execution to be lacking in several areas. That's what I want buffed, especially regarding escapable hits.

>I disagree entirely that people wouldn't understand the matchup well enough to exploit his fairly obvious weaknesses after 1 month. It's pretty apparent right now how to deal with the character, but the deal is that his damage output, his very strong punish game, and his handful of tools that can make up for his poor ranged normals all make up for his weaknesses. Hell I'd say he's stronger than Ryu, and Ryu's a solid mid tier at worst. Terry doesn't need buffs, he's fine as is."
smashbros,fdl8a7z,t1_fdkdm3x,1578518735.0,"Were you present when you used it against someone who can Counter you offstage? Did you bother to lab it out?

Edit: [Thanks for the downvote, people.](https://twitter.com/RangoSSB/status/1215144427993231361?s=20)"
smashbros,fdl88ww,t1_fdk4j0x,1578518717.0,"> Straight up false, Terry's Rising Tackle has hella invincibility. It's invincible from frame 5 and lasts like almost half the move, then has leg intangibility for the remaining duration. Where the hell did you get the idea that it wasn't invincible? 

Facing a Lucina who can Counter it. Lab it.

> It can whiff near the ledge, yeah, but only if you're right on the very edge of it. A Terry player can work around this with careful postitioning. 

A Terry player doesn't get a choice when that's his chance to strike. Ergo, he loses a combo option unless he can convert into charged Rising Tackle, which will kill at much higher percents.

> Assuming you're using the correct version of Power Dunk (the light version), it never whiffs mid stage. I can only assume you think it can consistently whiff mid stage because you keep using the heavy version, which can be SDI'd out of, but if you use the light version you deal the same damage and still have a very respectable amount of knockback (kills at like 90% near the ledge). 

Light version kills at higher percents with good DI. Light version can also be escaped. The very fact that heavy Power Dunk doesn't connect reliably is in itself already a massive flaw for the character.

> While we did just see that happen in a tournament recently, no one knows if you can consistently escape it yet. Considering we have shitloads of tournament footage where no one escapes Buster Wolf mid hit, I would say that at this time it is not nearly consistent enough for it to be a serious enough factor to consider a weakness. 

While it's not already enough that Buster Wolf's armor is finicky and inconsistent, being able to escape the move with Pac-Man's Up B makes it unreliable in, not just that matchup, but anyone with a 1-frame escape option. So it's going to become a widening gap as more players learn to escape it.

> Rising Tackle covers all around him, has invincibility, and has quite a bit of a horizontal hitbox actually. Nair has a small hitbox but can combo into Burn Knuckle for 26% and a potential kill. 

Rising Tackle has a [tiny hitbox up front](https://imgur.com/a/IiW2nwT). This makes it a poor choice for OoS. The fact that Nair combos into Burning Knuckle isn't the point here. It's that it's such a short reach that opponents can shield pressure you for free. 

And even then, at higher percents, you'll still have to convert Nair to Crack Shoot since Burning Knuckle won't KO, losing that option in the process.

> What the fuck are you smoking. 

Bair is his only aerial KO option. Yet due to facing his opponent, you have to dash in and buffer back just to get him to turn around, costing valuable time to setup a RAR Bair in the process.

> How tf is [this](https://ultimateframedata.com/hitboxes/terry/TerryUAir.gif) small? It covers a good ass amount of space above him easily. 

Most characters have an even better Uair or Nair option for juggling. Terry's is, at best, average, and still easy to stuff out with a superior hitbox hitting low.

> On top of all the misinformation, though, there are some parts here where it feels like you're just straight up ignoring some parts of the character too.  

None of this is misinformation. I've supplied my resources.

> Like for example, yeah his recovery is exploitable because he doesn't snap ledge, but he has hella mixups off stage and at least two invincible recovery tools. 

He has one. Input Burning Knuckle is only invincible on the fist. Stuff that out with a larger hitbox and it becomes a trade, further pushing Terry offstage. Input Rising Tackle is, again, not invincible despite its description.

> Power Dunk can even spike someone who gets overzealous and tries to go offstage after Terry. 

Which is likewise incredibly punishable, and lethal, should he whiff.

> Also the comparison to Ganon and Incineroar fails to acknowledge that Terry has solid approach tools and functional space control with his fireball and his slew of fantastic anti-airs, which Ganon and Incineroar don't have. 

Terry [runs faster](https://ultimateframedata.com/stats.php) than both and does have more air speed. Unfortunately, Ganondorf has much larger hitboxes from his Nair. Furthermore, Wizard's Foot crosses up and goes farther, unlike Burning Knuckle

The comparison to Incineroar is that both are still relatively slow with poor options in disadvantage state.

Power Wave is a decent projectile. That much he does have.

> I mean, I agree with you that a lot of people on this subreddit just kinda bitch about Terry because they're too lazy to adapt and learn the matchup, but you really don't have to try super hard to make him seem like a worse character than he really is. Terry is mad strong and that's pretty clear to see for everyone. 

That's because r/smashbros and the community at large lives in a hyperbole. So of course they don't know how to deal with a character beating them.

Terry is mad strong \*when\* up close and \*when\* he dishes out damage. The whole point here is to zone him out, out-space him, keep him in disadvantage, and edgeguard him. The fact that he lacks tools to cover all these options showcases that he struggles greatly in his matchup spread against swords and zoners, both of which largely make up the meta in this game.

Unfortunately, that's not clear to everyone who want to believe he's strong just because Riddles and Tsu are currently making waves with him. Much of that is due to opponent matchup inexperience. Once it becomes apparent how to deal with the character, his results will plummet. Unless he gets buffs in the next patch, don't expect Terry to keep the same momentum once people figure out the matchup."
