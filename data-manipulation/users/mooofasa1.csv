We know that he was sealed in the blood of alberius so it wouldn't be too far off to say that euden is morsayati himself, but if also like to add that I actually believe that illias child was morsayati but he wasn't evil then. I have a feeling that he somehow got corrupted and became the evil morsayati we know so while morsayati was sealed throughout grastea, maybe the good in morsayati was reincarnated into euden Which would also add on to the play of euden and evil Zethia being the same yet different."

unpopularopinion,ff7a3fo,t1_ff70pla,1579644319.0,"I completely agree with you. I'm Muslim, I've studued my own religion a lot yet I don't consider myself knowledgeable enough to debate about it on the internet, I leave that to the scholars. To add on to that many people on this platform don't do proper research and consider context before making claims that our prophet was a pedophile. There are many different accounts of how old one of his wives were and even then, the life expectancy was nothing like what it is today which is why we read with context. If you went to an aalim or scholar with a fair mind instead of ""all religions are evil"" etc. You would honestly find more to Islam than what you can believe spending 5 minutes on Google, if you actually read stories about the prophet without any bias, you can see how his character impacted the people around him and how he was seen as the greatest man to live in Islam. I've had doubts about my belief honestly. But I went to a scholar asking questions I never would have thought I'd ask and when I honestly too a moment to contemplate. I was brought back to Islam. Religion when followed truly, is beautiful but when people extort it for their own desires, then of course it'll look bad in other people's eyes. My point is to Please try to take a moment and learn instead of making blanket statements and moving in thinking you're a social justice warrior because you're just making a fool of yourself when you don't try to understand the full story. If anything, try reading the holy book of that religion. And please just have a fair mind because that's the most important thing when it comes to religion for me."

MurderedByWords,ff67gzl,t3_errwsd,1579620949.0,"Another thing is that the second X chromosome becomes a Barr body which is basically waste in a corner of the cell. Females can live with a single X chromosome, either way it still becomes a Barr body. Men only have one X chromosome because both sexes only need one as said before and the Y chromosome has a few genes but the most important one is The sex change Gene since all zygotes start out female. There are cases of the sex change Gene being inactive in the Y chromosome so some women born with a y chromosome will still function as if they never had the Y, so my point is that just because you have more dna doesn't particularly make you more or less intelligent. On top of that out of all our dna, only 1.5% codes humans. It's still a mystery what the 98.5% does but we know it plays a role"

tales,ff22kbk,t3_eqzhjw,1579492076.0,"I really want Yuri Lowell. Such a badass character in smash just crushing the competition is something I desperately need. He's got so many arts and abilities, it would be extremely easy to make a moveset, in fact. I made one myself. 

Yuri's abilities are really different compared to what the sword characters have in smash. 

He can have his normal 3 hit combo, tapping repeatedly will enter into brutal fang rapid jab

Tilts can be his directional attacks all of them have a uniqe combo like Marth's dancing blade

Up smash would be shining fang

Down smash would be tiger blade (shockwave when you hit the ground)

Side smash would be wolf strike

Neutral b would be azure storm, hold for final gale

Up b would be severing fang, hold for wailing havoc

Down b would be a counter in the form of ghost wolf, hold for crushing eagle 

Side b would be dragon swarm, hold for rending wolf charge
 
Final smash is Savage wolf fury

The way I was thinking is that Yuri is a combo fighter very similar to Terry where you can chain his base attacks with base artes and arcane artes. So smash attacks can be chained with b attacks but only if the smash connects. The b attacks that you hold are stronger but take a bit longer to pull off so your opponent can DI out of them at high percents.

Yuri's over limit guage will fill up as he takes and deals damage, once it's full, taunting will unleash it and you have the opportunity to use as many artes as you like with a lowered launch rate for 15 seconds. However, if the opponent has taken over 30% during overlimit, of damage, you will automatically perform a fatal strike at the end of over limit IF the opponent is still in hit stun. The fatal strike will deal 15% damage and is a confirmed kill at 100%+, if any less the opponent still takes the 15% but suffers no knockback. 

To make things balanced, damage to shield will be decreased significantly but the full 15 seconds will be enough to break it, catch your opponent off guard and give them a beating.

One more balance factor is that yuri's hit stun will be increased during overlimit becoming a double edged sword but his attack, speed, and defense will get a slight boost

Yuri is far from balanced in my opinion but I'm just putting it out there that he is way more different than all the fire emblem characters. I'm really hoping the developers would at least consider adding him because he's just such a great character

Edit: switched some arts so all B's are arcanes and all smash attacks are base"

DragaliaLost,fekrimw,t1_fekpxor,1579206109.0,"Thank you for the insight, my intention for the flurry rush ability was to pair with his skills so if he I-frames something, he's slowing down time by adding more seconds to the clock and speeds himself up like in BOTW. I was also thinking to make him wind attuned but his champions abilities belong to all elements so it would make sense to either make him light or colorless. He's supposed to be the fjorm for hzd and the champions cycle was supposed to mimic exalted glory but with better pay off and a longer activation rate. I would agree with your idea of making Zelda use bows but I think at her core, Zelda is primarily a magic user and would end up being a staff unit instead. If I get time later I'll try to make an adventure out of her since she has the sheikah slate which could Make her unique, also sheik is a possibility for the hybrid adventurer idea where she weilds a dagger like sheik when close to an enemy. I also wanted to make all the champions abilities equal in power. Miphas grace can great everyone if there isn't a heal skill available. Daruks protection will help you tank attacks as long as you have enough hp. Urbosas fury becomes an extremely strong damage skill that no enemy with a hitbox can escape from, and revalis gale gives 5 seconds for you to do whatever you want. And speeds you up. In general, link's kit is speed based attacks, playing skillfully while being daring will only make him faster and stronger."
DragaliaLost,fekmpy1,t3_epluwv,1579203261.0,"Alright I've got an idea. Link would be a hybrid adventure, a mix between bows and swords. Whenever he force strikes it'll be like a sword's and if you're with in close proximity of the enemy he'll attack with his sword but if he's a distance away then he'll shoot with his bow. His skills also change depending on distance but they'll have the same damage but different effects

Link, champion of Hyrule (light)

Ability 1: adaptive warrior- changes skill and tap combo depending on distance, will always force strike like a sword unit

Ability 2: flurry rush- if unit uses a skill to dodge an enemy attack, 2 seconds will be added to the clock for each attack dodged if there's a clock, and adventurer attack speed is increased by 5% per attack dodged for 15 seconds (the time increase will appear in the form of a +X:XX next to the ongoing clock)

Ability 3: curse res +100%- reduces susceptibility to curse by 100%

Skill 1 (distance): ancient arrow (becomes available when adventurer is a certain distance away from the enemy)- deals light damage to enemies directly ahead and inflicts paralysis

Skill 1 (close): parry strike (becomes available when adventurer is within close proximity of an enemy)- deals light damage to surrounding enemies and any attacks that pass through this adventurer are reflected.

Skill 2: champions cycle- there are 4 effects that cycle throughout the battle and this skill automatically charges and cannot be filled by attacking. The cycle will always stay the same and will go miphas grace -> daruks protection -> urbosas fury -> revalis gale

S2A: miphas grace:  heals all allies 100% of their hp and increases max hp by 5%

S2B: daruks protection: grants all allies a 3 use shield that nullifies damage equal to their hp, nullified damage is reflected.

S2C: urbosas fury: deals light damage to all enemies and inflicts paralysis x3

S2D: revalis gale: for the next 5 seconds, all allies are completely invincible (including purples) and attacks speed is increased by 10% for 15 seconds

With a skill prep and force prep wyrmprint, you can barely use all 4 phases of this skill twice in a 5 minute battle. It's extremely powerful so don't waste it

Co-ability: team attack speed +10%"
