BlackPeopleTwitter,ffdlc6x,t1_ffdl0j8,1579823319.0,"Wow that's awful. I just looked up the laws for NC on suing your employer, and yeah, turns out you can't sue in NC either. Egg on my face. That's such a horrific accident for abysmal compensation."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffdkqze,t1_ffdi56b,1579822953.0,"Easiest way to sue is to get a good lawyer. In this person's case, I think they'd have good grounds to receive better compensation. At least for the WC company I work for, I've seen people get more for less.

Edit: NVM north Carolina got bad laws"

ABraThatFits,ff6y701,t1_ff6xvvp,1579637320.0,That's what I told her but she said she doesn't care about support and is just looking for nipple coverage at this point. She sent me pics of her VS wireless bra and it clearly did not fit lol. I'll recommend those stores to her though

TwoXChromosomes,fedycmy,t1_fed8lrj,1579022482.0,"There's one woman at my job who always is dressed nicely with her hair and makeup done. She's literally the only one who puts that much effort into her appearance and I respect the hell out of anyone who can pull that off every single day. Meanwhile I wake up 30 mins before I have to be at work, put my hair up in some stupid pony tail and throw on something that works as far as an office level outfit goes. Then leave for work. Polar opposite of this woman but I could never trash talk someone who obviously puts effort into their look just cause they're pretty."

TopMindsOfReddit,fe8ndon,t3_eo0p09,1578928250.0,"As much as my father and I disagree about politics and what is actually going on in the world, I'm glad he never once pulled this shit on me. He also believes the University I attended is where I got my liberal ideas from (last I checked LSU is a public University in a red state so...)

AskReddit,fdsbjj4,t1_fdqkdz4,1578698820.0,"My bf and I got into this long debate on whether their cards are handwritten or not.

He finally changed his mind when I showed him how you can see the pen strokes and how is shiny on the parts they stopped the letter at. So, yes they are handwritten for anyone who is a naysayer"
