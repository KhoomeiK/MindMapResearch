college,fdw3lb3,t3_en3zrj,1578754742.0,I'll have 13k with only having to take out loans for a single year out of the four. Also the only year where I had to live on campus which is part of why I had to take out loans.
college,fd3i4u9,t3_ejxz16,1578158511.0,Eastern Illinois University has one. Need to visit it again sometime.
ironmaiden,fd3ft1b,t1_fd39rti,1578157879.0,Same for me. I find that those are really the only two post-reunion albums that I actually listen to regularly. The others have their highlights but they're not something I'm ever really in the mood to listen to all the way through
2meirl4meirl,fcozf22,t3_ei3pbq,1577845851.0,"""end me now it is the only way, too cruel that is what they say, release me from this lonely world, there is no hope"" Don't think Death was singing about a toothpaste tube though lmao"
college,fcgbw7w,t3_eh7a4u,1577638402.0,"Definitely the number one thing to look out for is transferring of credits. I got really lucky and all my credits from Hawaii were transferred to my school in Illinois but ik I wouldn't have been in such a good position had I chosen my other schools. As for the school experience, I got really lucky with some good roommates and some good friends but they all make fun of me for being cold when it gets below 75 smh. I haven't found the classes to really be much harder so I think you should be fine on that front too. Good luck!"
