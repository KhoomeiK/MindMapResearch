asoiaf,ffe9zdv,t1_ffcq0uf,1579840824.0,"The show really didn't want different characters having the same name lest it confuse the audience (though for obvious reasons the Freys were allowed to keep their boatload of Walders and Waldas). It's like how Asha Greyjoy was renamed Yara in the show, so she wouldn't be confused with Osha."

AionLegions,ff0wxa6,t3_eqv4sy,1579473069.0,"If an exp spirit is not max level for its star rating, feed it trash heroes until it hits max. You may awaken it if you don't mind spending the resources, just be aware that awakening only benefits you if you use the spirit to level a hero of the same element. It doesn't matter whether you awaken it before or after leveling it.

You don't have to keep heroes in your inventory to take advantage of the codex. If you pull a fire Ren, and then use him as fodder, the codex will still count him towards rewards."

In any case, he seems to primarily obsess over people he lost in the Tragedy of Duscur, and there had to be a lot more people there than just his dad, his stepmom, and one junior knight."
fatlogic,fec66ig,t1_febh48z,1578967293.0,"Probably talking about sumo wrestlers, and maybe power lifters in the highest weight class since they don't have to make weight. Mind you, it's not exactly a secret that sumo wrestlers have a noticeably shorter lifespan than the average Japanese man, and also athletes in heavyweight sports still have to actually perform so they can't get so fat it actually disables them."

asoiaf,fds2w58,t1_fdrq26b,1578693562.0,"I feel like the show forgot you can't actually rule through fear without an army supporting you, and armies are not actually composed of NPCs. It's like when Ramsay murders his father in front of multiple witnesses, and then sends for his stepmother and newborn half-brother - anyone with half a brain would go find some loyal knights instead, to arrest Ramsay and protect the baby."
fatlogic,fdrehna,t1_fdql1f3,1578683396.0,"A lot of places in the US aren't designed for pedestrians. I live maybe 1 mile away from a grocery store, but most of that mile is along a busy street with no sidewalk, where the speed limit is 45 mph.

fatlogic,fdrdtq6,t1_fdow8p1,1578683055.0,"If you don't do this already, frozen mixed veggies can be great. I'll heat them up per the instructions on the bag, drain any excess water, and add seasoned salt with a little butter or olive oil. 

Also, here's an easy soup recipe:
Chop up a small onion and a zucchini, plus a little garlic if you like garlic. Drain a can of black beans, then add beans and veggies to soup pot along with about half of a 1-pound bag of frozen sweet corn. Add enough water so it looks like a soup. Stir in whatever flavorings you like (I do chicken bullion and a chili spice mix) and simmer for 15-20 minutes - it's done when the veggies are cooked."
facepalm,fdr1r1z,t1_fdpmyia,1578678340.0,"It's a combination of factors. Modern society allows us to be very sedentary, while high-calorie food is both cheap and widely available, so it's easy to get fat. Lots of people are poorly educated about nutrition and don't know how to lose weight, or think they're eating much less than they really are, and there a lot of dumb myths floating around to confuse people further. So take a bunch of fat people who have repeatedly failed to lose weight and think it's impossible, add a social media echo chamber and a dose of ""nothing is your fault if you're Oppressed"" wokeness and you get this weird movement full of people who demand ""weight-neutral"" treatment for type 2 diabetes."
facepalm,fdogntk,t1_fdn0r8x,1578604767.0,"There is indeed a fat acceptance movement, which aims to convince everyone that being fat does not carry any health risks and also that losing weight is impossible and dangerous, therefore it's inappropriate for doctors to consider obesity a medical problem or recommend weight loss."

If you don't currently know how to cook these, look up a recipe for oven-roasted broccoli and start with that - it's really good when properly seasoned."

Sadly, her brother Takumi is a jerk and doesn't want her dating a ""goddamn foreign weeb."" But I will not lose heart! If I work hard, and do my best, I will surely convince him of my sincerity and he will accept me as part of the family."
fatlogic,fcrwrwo,t1_fcrrvi0,1577907688.0,"They're supposed to mean something like ""explain like a privileged asshole"". Like, ""mansplain"" was originally coined to describe how some men will just never believe a woman could know something, and will condescendingly explain things the woman clearly knows already. I've also heard ""whitesplain"" used to describe a white person explaining to a black person why the black person is wrong about a thing being racist. 

Although given that pattern, it should really be ""thinsplain"" in the OP, since it's about a currently-thin person 'splaining to a fat person."

freefolk,fbcb6bv,t1_fbbf4fa,1576719929.0,I feel like it's a perfectly reasonable artistic choice to cut away after making it clear that a death is about to happen; not every death needs to have blood and gore in our faces.
