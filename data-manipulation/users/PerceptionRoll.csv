IncelTears,ffaoymh,t1_ffaoms3,1579741085.0,"That is very true. That's why I'm so glad Chris Hansen is hot on his tail, documenting and investigating as much as possible. So much shit has come to light, so many victims and so many receipts.

I will live to see the day Shreg is going to jail. And it will be a beautiful day."
IncelTears,ffaokqj,t1_ffab4rv,1579740827.0,"Hey if someone I hanged out with for a while approaches me with that, I'll take it. Sounds lovely.

Otherwise sounds a bit weird. Depends on the context. It is much more effective, however, than the approach in panel 2."
niceguys,ffaldt3,t1_ffakz5i,1579738654.0,Oh no his fanboys are leaking all the way here.
PublicFreakout,ffa0e14,t1_ff9vgey,1579725344.0,"You're really fuckin' lame, did you know that?"
niceguys,ff3vdgl,t1_ff3m8ny,1579549674.0,"That's a bit mean. I think their stuff is nice. Just cause the radio loves to fucking overplay it, and knobs like this listen to it, it doesn't make it inherently bad.

ID are cool! Their newer album has nicer tunes."
dankmemes,femq9ta,t1_femlnm9,1579266431.0,"That's your inner demon trying to make you hate yourself like it hates you. Don't listen to it. I assure you that unless you're a dickhead, people will not mind conversing with you.

You are okay my friend. Don't think otherwise."
ChoosingBeggars,femq18q,t1_fel8oe9,1579266215.0,"Right?? 

Fuckin hell the amount of effort and products it goes into doing a full face of professional make up is worth quite a bit. $50 is a steal.

But if you're a poor pleb (like me) you can always just do your own. But I guess that's effort for entitled people ;v"
Mistborn,fej9gzr,t3_eoztik,1579162749.0,"You had me do a double take, I wasn't certain what subreddit I'm in.

So many tims in here as well, life is truly beautiful."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fej8i4j,t1_feh54g5,1579161455.0,"Yeah I have the exact same problem with checking any kind of notifications (messages from people, all my inboxes, texts, etc). I can never be calm about it, so what I do is just kind of force myself to do it for 10 seconds and then I can just check everything after the initial ""oh god oh jesus christ"" is over.

Glad to see I'm not alone!"
