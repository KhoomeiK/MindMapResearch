psychotherapy,ffjt077,t1_ffjstmg,1580006136.0,What you never said was how you came to know this.
psychotherapy,ffjs25z,t1_ffjq35a,1580005405.0,"I think there’s a chance we’ve already this conversation on this board in the past. Asking you to support your thesis that depression is caused by avoidance of emotions is not a basic question. The cause of clinical depression is highly contentious in behavioral health, but almost universally accepted as varying tremendously from person to person and the fact you A.) present yourself as having solved it and B.) present a singular solution that is incredibly subjective is odd to me, as is your unwillingness to explain it further.

If someone is seeking therapy with me because they are severely traumatized and need to learn grounding and resourcing strategies as a bridge to doing exposure therapy, I will do that with them. If someone is seeking therapy because they have an eating disorder and they need someone to do meal support with them, I will do that with them. What I will not do is force them to meet some nebulous and arbitrary standards about self acceptance before I help them apply therapeutic interventions that can improve their life and reduce their symptoms. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that what they tell me they need help with is in fact something they need help with. I’m not sure why you can’t imagine a version of this that doesn’t involve berating the client, but unlike you I am not willing to insult you or your training to explain away our theoretical differences.

Sometimes I come across a client who has very typical life struggles and is just being unrealistically hard on themselves. In these cases I do focus primarily on acceptance. These people form a very small proportion of my caseload.

You assume I disagree with you because I don’t understand you, which is arrogant. I understand you and I continue to disagree with you."
psychotherapy,ffjkerx,t1_ffji7v8,1580000244.0,Our job consists of more than your theoretical framework.
psychotherapy,ffjdswg,t1_ffjc0e2,1579996162.0,"I’m arguing one approach is better than the other because I believe one approach is better than the other. This strategy would be ineffective at best, offensive and invalidating at worst for the majority of clients I have worked with.

I do believe much of what the person I responded to stated is wrong."
psychotherapy,ffja1ch,t1_ffj9bux,1579993933.0,Interesting. That hasn’t been my experience. What is your statement based on?
psychotherapy,ffj96l3,t1_ffj8wvl,1579993397.0,You consider depression to be a behavior?
psychotherapy,ffj8s7m,t1_ffj8j2l,1579993148.0,Well we have found our fundamental disagreement. I absolutely believe you can change who you are. You can change from being an addict to not being an addict. You can change from being depressed to not being depressed. You can change from being an abuser to not being an abuser. You can change from being unmotivated to being motivated. I would consider these examples of changing who you are.
psychotherapy,ffj7ra9,t1_ffj5xi1,1579992499.0,"No, if someone comes into therapy because they want help that is their assumption not mine. I am accepting their feelings and experiences as a premise for doing psychotherapy. You, in trying to convince them of a different reality then what they are articulating to you, are actually rejecting their perspectives, feelings, and experiences by trying to be accepting.

If I was your client and you took this approach with me from day one, it would be obvious to me that this is simply a generic perspective you hold of humanity in general that has nothing to do with me personally."
psychotherapy,ffj7jur,t1_ffj6mfb,1579992358.0,"Your exact words were “showing the client they are OK the way they are.” If they do not initially believe that, you will be trying to convince them of this if you want them to believe it.  And I’m sorry but the sunset metaphor is just stupid. Even if you decided you wanted to make some adjustments to a sunset it would be completely irrelevant because you have no control over a sunset. But you can absolutely change your life. These things have nothing in common at all."
psychotherapy,ffj6ez3,t1_ffiwqu5,1579991566.0,"That they are OK the way they are is your perspective. Trying to convince them of that is trying to force your truth and your perspective onto them.

That’s how I would feel if I was your client and this was your approach. Whether you are interested in that or not is up to you. Be mindful that indiscriminate acceptance can actually come across as rejection."
psychotherapy,ffj5dgy,t1_ffiwyx5,1579990820.0,"If a client comes to you struggling with something they cannot manage on their own, and your primary strategy is to try and convince them that they are OK the way they are, how is that not invalidating them?"
psychotherapy,ffiwhlw,t1_ffikrjy,1579984396.0,In fact it sounds like that is basically the approach the OP’s colleagues take when this topic is brought up and the OP clearly doesn’t find it helpful. https://i.imgur.com/SafMvnK.jpg
psychotherapy,ffivjmg,t1_ffikrjy,1579983736.0,Do you realize how invalidating that approach can be?
psychotherapy,ffii771,t1_ffi9tq8,1579974464.0,That’s kind of silly though. People come to you because they want some kind of change to occur.  If all you do is “watch them unfold” what are you actually doing for them?

AskMen,ffh023x,t1_fffhj8v,1579919497.0,That’s probably because the first session was a massive rip off of another show and after that they had to come up with their own ideas.
psychotherapy,ffgzl78,t3_etdhkm,1579919144.0,"It’s been 2 weeks? It’s not really that unusual for a client to make no visible progress in 2 weeks. Keep speaking your truths but be patient with him.

If you believe in what you are saying, just keep saying it. Real change takes time. One of the biggest mistakes I’ve made is constantly changing interventions when the ones I’ve tried don’t work at fast as I want them to. I think this ends up confusing and overwhelming the client.

I’ve spent 2 months trying to convince someone to eat breakfast. I just kept at it, kept saying why it would help, etc. Eventually one day she just started doing it. I didn’t really say or do anything differently it just finally sunk in. That’s how it usually goes. Time is an important part of the equation."
psychotherapy,ffgz6a3,t1_ffgt4x1,1579918834.0,"I agree, I make it a point to never speak like this in session."
ufc,ffgriw7,t3_ethkr7,1579913220.0,Brandon Thatch and Thomas Almeida come to mind.
psychotherapy,fffu2dp,t1_fffqa0g,1579891804.0,"Personally I haven’t had any issues with 90837 either but I do mainly exposure therapy for trauma and CBT for eating disorders. Colleagues I know who are doing more standard CBT or IPT for depression/anxiety have had some difficulty.

We obviously have different training and work in different environments. I work in a hospital and use a shared electronic records system with physicians, surgeons, dietitians etc so in my case keep the notes brief and formal protects the patients confidentiality. I see the purpose of progress notes as simply documenting that a service was performed so that I can be reimbursed."
Marriage,fffnh8b,t3_esrouy,1579887746.0,"Depends on the relationship. My best friend was the most important person in the world to me, until I started dating my wife. Before her I was in a pretty decent 4 year relationship and would have chosen him over her in a second. But once my wife and I started dating, I knew quickly that she was my most important relationship."
Marriage,fffn1kg,t1_ffca1ex,1579887484.0,That he sees it as bitching is her interpretation. Based on the rest of her post I’m going to say that I don’t trust her interpretation of her husbands words or actions.
Marriage,fffmrgv,t1_ffbu49b,1579887312.0,"It sounds like she doesn’t appreciate him because she blames/resents him for choices they made as a couple. Having kids is a decision they both made. Each time they had another kid, a decision they both made. Her being a stay at home mom is a decision they both made. It sounds to me like they either made a lot of choices impulsively, or she did not communicate her wants and needs adequately to her partner. She is now in a situation she finds undesirable, which is fair, but she is blaming him for the fact she is here which is completely inaccurate and inappropriate. Did she voice these feelings to him each time they talked about trying to have another child, or when they talked about her staying home? Either she did, and he consistently ignored him, in which case he’s a jerk and I don’t understand why she would continue with these plans knowing he wouldn’t respect her feelings, or she didn’t in which case the responsibility for her current life situation lies primarily with her. Or they had never these conversations at all in which case they are two irresponsible people in an unhealthy relationship. But in none of these possible scenarios is the husband unequivocally the bad guy while she is his helpless puppet which is what she clearly wants us to think."
Marriage,fffm8km,t3_esosa1,1579886989.0,What do you mean you have 4 of his children? Are you a step mom or are they also your kids? Your phrasing on this and many other parts of your post are tremendously confusing. Having a baby “caused” you to drop out of college? It sounds like you have up your career (which is NOT giving up your life - but it is giving up a part of it) for your children not your husband. You seem very confused.
Marriage,ffflq7e,t3_etcoy3,1579886682.0,It’s not inherently crucial. Personally I just don’t get it. Sleeping is a solo activity for me.
personalfinance,fffiwwp,t1_fffhy5d,1579884941.0,Wow those work hours are rough. That’s a pretty atypical situation and I can understand how it could change your priorities.
personalfinance,fffh7fa,t1_fffda2m,1579883889.0,"Are you a single dad? I’m 36 and have 2 kids and the time after they go to bed is usually the only time I can really connect with my wife. I go to the gym before she wakes up in the morning and the evenings are pretty busy with dinner, baths, housework, and playing with the kids.

It’s not “harm” in the something really bad will happen to you if you do this sense. It’s “harm” (I’m not even sure that’s the word I would use) in that as a busy adult, any time you are doing something there are always other things you could be doing. For me there is always a higher value option than drinking or smoking pot so the “harm” is simply missed opportunity or lost productivity.

I honestly hope that I never reach a point in my life where I am 100% comfortable with where I am. I am mostly comfortable currently, but if I ever reached the point where I saw no possible improvements or next steps I would find that very depressing. I can always find a way to get in better shape, learn a new recipe, make the house look nicer or function better, improve my relationship with someone, learn a new skill for work, read some nonfiction, etc."

personalfinance,fffcpwj,t1_fffc9z6,1579881074.0,"Yeah at some point in the last few years my focus began to shift from “do what would feel best right now” to “do what will provide you with a deeper sense of satisfaction in life.” It’s really the same mindset as investing money. At first it is significantly less exciting than spending it, and the rewards are minimal. But as you start to build momentum and see the benefits of your investment it becomes so much more exciting and fulfilling. Same with investing time and energy in your health, relationships, living space, skills, etc."
personalfinance,fffce7g,t1_fffakl4,1579880870.0,"As someone who has drank heavily, drank in moderation, and abstained from drinking I can say that for me abstinence feels best. Nothing feels as rewarding to me as improving myself or my life and even moderate alcohol use takes away from that to a degree. I don’t have a problem with people that drink, but there are consequences to it (such as  having less money and taking in worthless calories) even with safe and appropriate use.

Your statement about making doing nothing fun is actually the point for me. I need to stay motivated. Doing nothing sucks so instead of doing nothing I do things that matter. If doing nothing wasn’t boring I would be less motivated to do things that matter."
personalfinance,fffbwgj,t3_etb0ju,1579880562.0,"I stopped drinking and I’m freaking ripped now, sleep better, have more money and more energy. Being buzzed doesn’t feel half this good. I don’t miss it at all."
psychotherapy,fffb7b2,t1_fff2t5d,1579880114.0,"My progress notes are about a paragraph. Symptoms, interventions, changes. What are you writing that takes 20 minutes?

I know 90837’s pay a lot more but it’s risky. Many insurance companies either won’t pay it or will take it back after an audit unless you are doing DBT or prolonged exposure therapy. As I said before, if you are doing work of that nature I could see how 7 clients is a lot.

We have a case consultation meeting for an hour e/o week on site.

I work for a multidisciplinary team so most of my patients other providers are in house and consulting only involves walking down a hallway."
psychotherapy,fff23z4,t1_fff1nfc,1579873614.0,"Ok so 7 45 minute sessions a day if you are billing 90834. That’s 5 hours and 15 minutes of direct client contact plus 3 minutes per note. That’s not even 6 hours of work. I don’t see why this is so crazy. Maybe it’s too much if you are doing something really intense and specialized like trauma processing, but in general it seems very reasonable.

I schedule 8.5 client hours/day and am nowhere near a burnout, and doubt I ever will be. I’m not saying everyone should do that, we are all different. But it’s not some universally awful idea that no one can manage."
psychotherapy,ffeahq3,t1_ffe5vur,1579841266.0,"Not everyone does all of those things though. My job is therapy and documentation of therapy. I don’t supervise anyone or do any case management. So 7 clients in a day plus an hour for documentation (which is way more than I need for 7 therapy sessions, they take like 3 minutes) is an 8 hour work day which is a pretty normal thing. And you won’t have a 100% show rate either. At most places I’ve worked an 85% show rate is pretty good, so on average if you schedule 7 you will see 6. And that’s assuming you do 1 hour sessions. If you do 45 minute sessions, see 6 people a day, and take 30 minutes to write your notes that’s a 5 hour work day. I don’t see that being a recipe for burnout I guess. To me that’s a short day of work."

RaidShadowLegends,ff9j6bk,t3_es8ytw,1579714138.0,The calculation is incomplete because it doesn’t factor in what you would do with the energy you saved from not running Minotaur.

psychology,fdncc6x,t1_fdk4u7z,1578582734.0,"This appears to be a summary of studies, not an actual study. The studies it is referencing are assessing the benefit of actually spending time in nature/being outdoors and how it relates to improved mental health. I have no dispute with those findings but it does not relate to the article we are commenting on. This article was about a stronger felt sense of connection to nature from doing drugs, not an actual change in interaction with nature/time spent outside/etc.

My question is not “does being more connected to nature help our mental health?” I absolutely know that it does. My question is “does feeling more connected to nature without actually doing anything provide any benefit?” The article you’ve linked does not answer that."
Parenting,fdnb2b6,t1_fdlsm84,1578581912.0,"That feels dangerous to me. These sound like they are essentially psychotherapy processing groups and not just psychoeducation. A curriculum doesn’t apply to open processing situations. I have no problem with a teacher doing psychoeducation but I do have a problem with a teacher facilitating something like grief processing. They are not adequately trained for that and such groups can easily do more harm than good if they are not facilitated appropriately, and I have seen licensed behavioral health professionals struggle to facilitate group effectively with emotionally regulated adults. It’s a great idea in theory it just needs to be implemented correctly."
Marriage,fdn5fnv,t1_fdllatz,1578577792.0,"This has never made sense to me. I feel like you would be more understanding of your partner having a wandering eye if you were insecure. Like “I’m not that great so I get why he/she wants to look around.”

I am very secure in both my appearance and my overall value/capability as a partner and parent, which is exactly why it would bother me greatly for my wife to be checking out other people. I can’t imagine what she would be looking for. Unless she’s secretly into dad bods or deadbeats or something.

I happen to know my wife shares my perspective.  She got invited to see magic mike with some friends but declined because “why would I want to see a movie about a bunch of guys showing off their bodies that are no better than my husbands?”"
