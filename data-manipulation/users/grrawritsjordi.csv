I didn’t get diagnosed with anxiety until I was 23 and at almost 31 it has gotten way worse. I took medicine on and off for the last 7 years and was never consistent with taking it daily. After a recent breakup I started taking it religiously and seeing a therapist and my life has changed dramatically. My stomach problems are better, I hardly ever dry heave and I don’t have the panic/anxiety attacks as regularly. I’ve even stopped taking my benzos and have had the same bottle for over 3 months. I feel like a completely different and happier person. I honestly haven’t changed much else in my life since the breakup besides moving into my own place from my grandparents’ house (where I had to move after the breakup). I 100% believe the medication has made me better and well enough to be on my own. 

Medication isn’t for everyone but it might be a good start to getting your life back."
