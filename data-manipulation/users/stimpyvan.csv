So, depending on your phone battery, a 2000mAh battery should be good to charge your phone (at least partially) once.  Battery charging is a weird, complicated thing though. 

The point of this post is, if there are only 3 batteries connected.  A typical AA battery (like in the picture) should be able to provide 2000 mAh.  The problem is when the voltage in the charger equals the battery voltage in the phone, the phone stops charging.

Because Capt William Rogers had a hard on to blow something up.  There is a reason the USS Vincennes had the nickname ""Robocruiser"".  I've spoken to people that were in the Combat Information Center of the Vincennes when it happened.  The airliner was climbing and the transponder identified it as civilian aircraft.  Rogers was convinced that it was an F-14 pretending to be a civilian aircraft and ordered it fired upon.  The Vincennes was in Iranian territorial water when the shoot down happened.
