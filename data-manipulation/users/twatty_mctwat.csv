UnethicalLifeProTips,ff5i644,t3_erocdw,1579593982.0,"Did the same with Belvedere Vodka bottle. No single one can tell the difference between a cheap eristoff and an expensive one. 

In fact, i did a vodka blind tasting couple of times.  With 7 different brands - from €5 brand up to €50 - and every tester got different results. There wasnt even a tendency. 

The big take away was to just fill your cheap ass vodka into an expensive bottle and serve with ice. No one will get the difference."

IllegalLifeProTips,ff4fwuh,t1_ff436th,1579562648.0,"No bullshit at all. It all depends on the context. If a small woman is threatened by the big intruder (like approaching directly to her, instead of fleeing after being seen), the women is in immediate danger and allowed to shoot him. The case is easier if she shoots him in arms and legs to just weaken him, instead of a shot in the head. 

But if the intruder breaks in, and tries to flee after being seen, she has no chance to use a weapon against him without consequences. Of course, in reality judges are more likely on the side of the victim, but you get the point."

facepalm,fcd9k0v,t3_egwiza,1577607927.0,"I dont think this is ridiculous. Mcdonalds has put a huge effort in making their burgers so well known. When someone selling burgers with a similar name, i would sue them too (or at least tell them to shut it off). The correlation between burgers and the name mac is not at all given by nature or was common before mcdonalds. 

Its way more ridiculous when apple sues actual apple farmers which just want to sell their non-computer-related products. 

Exclaimer: dont want to side with mcdonalds, just worked a lot with copyright laws lately."
