mildlyinfuriating,ff243ek,t1_ff1t3ir,1579493258.0,The house I live in was built in the 60s which is pretty old for my city. Most places here were built between the 20s and 80s.
mildlyinfuriating,fevz6nd,t1_fesgwt2,1579403319.0,Im confused on how that’s more efficient than convection. And where’s the radiator? In your walls? Do you have one wall in every room? I don’t understand these logistics
mildlyinfuriating,fes569a,t1_fes2srt,1579361490.0,"I live in Canada where no one I’ve met who lives in a house built from the 1900s on has a radiator. How tf do they work? 

Also I live in -40 as well and convection is just fine?"
mildlyinfuriating,fes44sg,t1_fes1ue6,1579361205.0,My mother told me never to cover them at all. Just move it forward so it not covering or move it like 3 inches to the side
aww,feiyiqf,t3_eooc2h,1579150799.0,I adore that collar! Where is it from?
AskReddit,feav7xs,t3_eo3q9l,1578952498.0,All the resolutioners at the gym are prolly gonna look at me.
microbork,fe3pute,t1_fe3p33b,1578851747.0,Thank you! I adore the breed. They have so much personality.

AskReddit,fdzwyn9,t1_fdyxrdz,1578797811.0,"Gosh never do that. At risk of sounding conceded, I went a long time thinking I was unattractive because no one ‘liked’ me. Later (usually after platonically befriending the person) I learnt they had a thing for me but thought I was out of their league. 

Let the person you’re pursuing decide if you’re “in their league” or not."
AskReddit,fdl76xt,t3_elssvy,1578518205.0,"Growing up we lived along the river that runs through my city. When I was little, I thought that the river was the ocean and that on the other side of the river, was China (we live in Canada btw). 
My mom used to say “I’m going for a run across the river” and I used to think she meant she was literally going to run *on* the water. We lived near a train and pedestrian bridge. She was definitely not running on the water."
AskReddit,fdi1029,t3_eled64,1578433813.0,The echo chamber of opinions on subs like AITA and other advice based subs. Have a differing opinion and you get downvoted into oblivion.
AskReddit,fdd1drc,t1_fdcux9q,1578290940.0,I suck at games and barely play games but i loveee watching other people play games. If I know the person it makes it feel more like im hanging out w them watching them play games without the social aspect. And watching someone who’s not very good is wayyy more fun than watching someone who’s great. Makes it feel more casual and makes me (a person terrible at games) feel better about my personal lack of skill.

YouShouldKnow,fdbbjzr,t1_fdb4wna,1578255771.0,"Ig that’s fair. I live in the city and there’s snow 8+ months of the year so you can’t see the lines anyways. Even when there isn’t snow, they’re usually so faint you can’t see them anyways."
YouShouldKnow,fdb4esk,t1_fd9s5eq,1578253654.0,"Tbh i find more of a problem with people using brights. At least if they have no lights on, you can still get the reflection of tail lights and see drls but when they have brights on, you can’t see their car or your lane or anything else in your path."

VetTech,fd622we,t1_fd60uvw,1578184480.0,"If you want you screw with their growth hormones and leave them with behavioural issues and juvenile wirey coats, then sure. 

It’s people’s own decision wether or not to fix their pets, and it’s not always the best option. Actually, it frequently isnt."
YouShouldKnow,fczmgjm,t3_ejm2zb,1578104433.0,Yea idc about that but where do I find this data? I want to know
AskReddit,fcxv7o6,t1_fcxpdoh,1578070920.0,"People might be shitting on you for this but I totally get it. My ex gave me a (very small) memento his grandmother gave to him while she was dying. We broke up 2 years ago and I still have it because he lives a province away. I hate him, certainly, but I can’t just throw it away."
AskReddit,fcxsr3h,t1_fcx9dk4,1578069968.0,"Oh god, my friend’s boyfriend cheated on her (well, she found out he was cheating half the relationship) after they’d been together a year. She ended it and he was trying to get her back and verbatim said “I tried my best for you”. Clearly your best was pretty shitty."
AmItheAsshole,fcmptor,t3_ehx20t,1577786251.0,"Okok this is a lil out of left field, I’d agree but I mean I doubt it’s really her fault? It was just a little mix up in her timeline. 

Most people, including yourself admittedly, don’t have exact dates for when each period occurred. Likely in her mind, Rome fell: a long ass time ago and dinosaurs walked the earth: a long ass time ago. 

I don’t think calling her a dumbass is fair. I get it if you were taken off guard but apologize man. You made her feel really dumb for a small mix up.

Yta, or esh maybee"
NameNerdCirclejerk,fcmp3ub,t3_ehvlbh,1577785225.0,...really? Im used to seeing it spelled Jacquelyn.
AskReddit,fcmcw6u,t1_fcldl6d,1577770830.0,"That reminds me

My grandma asked me to pick her up 4 ripe bananas from the grocery. Not a super easy feat, most are greenish and not ready to eat. My closest shoppers had a bunch of 4, ripe bananas. Regular price is $2.69. These were a bit past ripe so they had a “save $2 sticker” i spent $.69 on those bananas and the smile on my grandma’s face when I gave her those bananas was worth much much more."
AskReddit,fcmabl7,t3_ehtq3g,1577768568.0,"Movie tickets 

And tickets to things in general (concerts, tours, gondolas)

I just think of it like a cute little memento and its fun to go through them every now and then and see what I was doing on those days. I have ones as old as 2015."
VetTech,fcjbdqj,t1_fcjaph6,1577682070.0,"Tbf, that’s a healthy age for a spay. Spaying too early can cause many other problems in itself."
VetTech,fcjbbgz,t1_fcj1ybe,1577682019.0,"I mean it’s a pretty major surgery you’re typically subjecting a puppy to, and well bred lines shouldn’t have pyo."
Welding,fcfyx2x,t1_fcfx2nl,1577635002.0,Alright buddy.
Welding,fcfte46,t1_fcfqo3x,1577633557.0,"Lmao that’s pretty naive. Lets say the kid kills himself on it, grieving people aren’t themselves. They could come after him bc they are looking for someone to blame."
Welding,fcd1ec9,t1_fccw4c0,1577605159.0,That’s like saying “I wouldn’t date anyone that would break up with me”. Well obviously not but people and circumstances change.
Welding,fc6r2di,t1_fc6jy1b,1577487311.0,Im in welding at a highschool too and we ALL have to wear cotton coveralls AT LEAST. Most of the time a leather apron as well. Even in cotton coveralls I set myself on fire arc welding. Don’t take welding safely lightly. It’s incredibly easy to really fuck yourself up.
CleaningTips,fc5vh0r,t3_eg28l7,1577466772.0,Baseboards. Give them a wipe and you’ll be surprised how much it brightens up the place.
AmItheAsshole,fc5myai,t3_eg8hdn,1577461804.0,"Yta. This is a really immature way of dealing with fellow assholes. If neither of you care for the people getting married, just don’t go."
