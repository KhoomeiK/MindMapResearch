Then he plays ONE time, once, and the fucker falls down all phases of addiction to rock bottom in 2 days?


It's like that except with murder."
explainlikeimfive,ffhdluw,t1_ffhbrz1,1579930983.0,"This is good but I'd bring it down to something more like:


Let's say you want to tell your friend across the street to remember to bring his toy tomorrow for show-and-tell but it's already almost bedtime and you can't go over there or call him. 


Instead, your friend has a special language where you can turn your lights on or off and the pattern you make spells words. But, it's really hard to remember the whole code!


You're in luck, though! Your friend's sister is having a sleepover with your sister, she knows the special language!


Oh no, but his sister doesn't speak English, she speaks French! But again, you know your sister speaks English and French!

You ask your sister to ask her friend to control the lights and interpret what you're saying to your friend so finally, you can remind him.


You say to your sister, ""Remember your toy for show and tell!"" Your sister says to her friend, ""Souviens-toi de ton jouet demain!"" As his sister flips the lights on and off, your friend watches the lights and understands the message. Tomorrow, he will remember his toy!


Your friend is the computer. His sister is the assembler. Your sister is the compiler. You are the programmer.


Programmers write code (say the message), the compiler translates that code so the assembler will understand  (English to French), and the assembler translates that to the computer (flipping the lights on and off).


Computers only know ""on"" and ""off"". A programmer could write a program entirely using on/off (binary) but a simple program can be millions of on/offs! Instead, there's an assembler which translates binary to a very rudimentary language. Again, programmers could write a program entirely in assembly but, wow, that can still be very long! So finally, programmers use a compiler which translates assembly into a coding language. Finally, the coding language is easy enough to remember for programmers and much shorter than assembly or binary.


ETA: I just realized maybe you meant how does a computer go from understanding binary (on/off) to making a program start up on your screen.


Continuing the analogy...


The on/off code doesn't actually spell words, it describes lines your friend writes down, like when you're writing down words and 1 tall line and 1 arch that starts at the bottom and stops at the top is an ""r"". Because he wrote it down, he can see the whole word at a time ""remember"". His brain fires up and when he reads ""remember"" he's already thinking about what he needs to remember. By the time he reads ""toy"", his brain is already building up to remembering his toy... But toy for what? He's already in motion trying to remember until he reads ""for show and tell"" and then bam! He goes right over to get the special toy and put it in his bookbag.


Your computer knows binary because it's made of tiny little transistors whose only job is I'M OPEN, I HAVE ELECTRICITY and I'M CLOSED, NO ELECTRICITY HERE.


Other transistors listen for them to scream about being open or closed and then react by opening and closing which triggers yet more to open and close. As each opens and closes in their turn, they're specially made to point at other transistors who open and close in different directions. If you keep going, you can build very complex sets of reactions which other pieces of hardware (like a screen) can use to display stuff. Imagine a really long game of telephone!"

>1: promoting health or well-being of mind or spirit


I agree that this isn't the most healthy _food_ but it's better than no lunch for the kid so I'd say it meets the criteria of promoting the kid's health (eating something v. nothing) and well-being (eating with classmates v. sitting with no food).


Besides, have you seen school lunches lately? This one is 10x better than that. Hell, even jail food is higher quality. Even if the kid could get on the free plan and even with the trashy mlm junk this is still more wholesome than a school lunch."

You can work on leaves and stems, don't worry about planning out work for different stitches.

TrollXChromosomes,fep9iki,t3_eq9tqn,1579315164.0,"THIS is body acceptance, appreciation. It's not denying what your body is, it's a fundamental acceptance and appreciation that these pieces are _you_. It's not denying that your body is different, it's not redefining aesthetics. It's accepting and embracing _you_ and everything that comes with it.


Changing your appearance does not negate that embrace. 


You can be fat, want to change that, and still appreciate your Self for what you are right now in the moment. Wanting to stay in this moment and not change a single ounce doesn't mean you need to deny that your high weight can be harmful to your health.


You can have a big nose and recognize that this is _your_ nose, nobody else carries it around but you; this is the nose you breathe with, this is the nose that caresses your lovers' face when you kiss so passionately you feel like you're melting into one another. Wanting to change its shape doesn't mean you are less, wanting to keep it just how it is doesn't remove its character and style.


I love this message. I am me and no other can be what I am, this is what I have made and I might change it or I might not but no one can deny me the love I give to myself."

I grew up on a ranch and we never purposefully got dogs they just kinda wandered up and never left. I mean, when the vet came out for the horses he'd tag as many dogs and cats as we could catch at the time for rabies and deworming, spay and neuter if he brought the stuff for it but anything else we just didn't do.


After that, I just had a really long gap in owning a dog. I thought I did everything right but looking back, I honestly played fast and loose with the prevention meds, giving them a week early or a week late. I really didn't think I was cutting it close.

Her father is Nigerian and her mother is a Russian Jew.

She comes from two notoriously insular communities famous for shunning outsiders (for arguably understandable reasons) born into a country that hates both. She's probably grown up getting shit from literally every direction. Too American, not American enough not black enough, not white enough, too tall, not slim enough, too outspoken, challenged at every step to prove why she deserves a spot at the table so many others sit comfortably at with half her qualifications and knowledge.

No, I don't want those people to be held down by their neck their whole lives because of it. I believe that people are _good_ at their core or at least most people are. Get them off the streets, get them meaningful employment, get them food and security and _safety_. Give them room to just breathe, give them opportunities to make what reparations they can for what this vicious world drove them to. THEN, see show they are. THEN, see what they do with their life.
