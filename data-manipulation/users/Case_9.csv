facepalm,fgt5q5s,t1_fgt594l,1581099603.0,Well I'm sure having their anus flayed so humans can extend their exploitation isn't doing them any favors.
facepalm,fgt4ph3,t1_fgsxmcg,1581098996.0,"Of course you don't take it seriously, you're not on the other end of the stick. I'll take this fine moment to remind us all of ""mulesing"", also know as the humane manner in which a kindly sheep farmer pins a sheep down and flays all the skin around its anus. Flaying things alive isnt just for GoT villains anymore! Now anyone can flay a live animals genitals and call it rustic animal husbandry. This is to prevent feces getting caught in the wool of the sheep and causing disease, so a quick recap.

1) Breed sheep to the point they are born into bodies they can't survive in

2) Flay their anus

3) Continue with your long term plans of thoughtless torture and exploitation 

Remind me again why extinction isnt preferable?"

Edit: Saftey from predators? We are the predators."
facepalm,fgt323g,t1_fgt0ycx,1581098012.0,I think they're saying extinction is preferable to eternal suffering and subjugation.
facepalm,fgt2y05,t1_fgsv8pg,1581097944.0,"Well we get wool and mutton, and in return they get eternal suffering and subjugation. What a deal."

skyrim,feneyz0,t3_eps6f3,1579283248.0,Always gives me rust vibes; the TG quest had been feeling like I should just C4 the door.
totalwar,felxj57,t3_ep3xhd,1579233448.0,That pointy-eared prick was sending doomstack after doomstack of sisters and sword masters after poor defenseless Sartosa while the Dark Elfs were painting the croissant purple. Really wish the AI had a stronger sense of self-preservation.
totalwar,felvo5y,t3_epp71h,1579232089.0,"All your units pig-piled on the bloaty to crush it under their combined weight then threw down their arms to fight the Vampcap MMA style, that is until he suffered an unrelated aneurism following the fulfillment of his pledge to get exactly 69 kills. In their haste to call an ambulance the deck droppers accidentally dropped their zombies who died on impact, leading to >50 additional deaths from fall damage. Maybe the bats flew into a jet engine after I don't know. The Zombies were very pleased with themselves however and dubbed it a heroic victory.

Either that or the guns expended their ammo by killing their own deck droppers after which the battle proceeded as normal."
totalwar,fekk0mj,t1_fekel1x,1579201658.0,Yeah but they ripped off zombie pirates from that one Scooby Doo movie

MorbidReality,fdkm8cf,t1_fdkafen,1578506464.0,Developing countries generally lack municipal trash pickup forcing people to burn their trash in their yard. Plastics get caught in the updraft and get scattered by wind or carried by rain runoff so they're pretty much everywhere.
