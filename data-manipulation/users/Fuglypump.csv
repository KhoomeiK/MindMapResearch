Crossout,ffrhynt,t3_eutmxk,1580158371.0,"If you are on PC, search the exhibition for ""Bigfug"" (enable all-time) to find my latest fatman build, you may use as it a template to create your own or just straight up copy it if you want to, it is peak performance maxed out to the point where you can't really make it any better without fusing the cabin for extra mass. But I dare anyone to make it better, make this the meta please because it is fun to play against! Fatties are my favorite weapon and have been since before open beta started lol. They are the brawler cannon, you get up close and personal. Combine it with speed then you create a monster that can outmaneuver everyone (including melee and shotgunners) while blasting them to bits!

required parts: 2x fatmen, Big G generator, Colossus engine, Harpy cabin, 1x purple box (fused for capacity), 2x Bigfoot and 2x Bigfoot ST. Lvl 15 steppenwolf recommended to protect the explodey bits, but you could probably manage with other parts than hard modules.

Harpy cabin + fused purple ammo box allows me to get away with only using 1 ammo box, which lets me dedicate that more mass towards armor. You can use other cabins, I even have an echo version (also labeld ""bigfug"") which is way tankier if that is more your style. Whatever you do just avoid using blue ammo boxes or a gas generator for this kind of build because every part of the build is meant to take a heavy beating.

Fatties overall are a safe investment, they are cheap and effective, they have always been effective and I'd dare to say that they always will be.

Crossout,ffjzbv4,t3_ets8q4,1580011112.0,"Really you should level all the factions in somewhat parallel, to start off you want to reach about level 3-4 on every faction before you start to push one really far. It's really up to you on what to progress *first* as you'll eventually hit max level on every faction if you stay with the game and keep playing. So instead of just telling you what to level, I will tell you what makes each faction worth leveling only taking structure/frames into considering. (ignoring everything that you can craft or buy from the market)

**Lunatics:** Provides light frame pieces, plows/bumpers are extremely efficient, low mass parts useful for spaced armor

**Nomad:** bladewings are absurdly efficient, small plows are very useful, some large parts are useful to use as spaced armor

**Scavenger:** 2nd most efficient parts in terms of structure vs powerscore ratio, highest structure plows, has 4x8 pieces

**Steppenwolf:** Most efficient parts in terms of structure vs powerscore ratio, has 2x8 and 4x8 pieces

**Dawn Children:** 3rd most efficient parts in terms of structure vs powerscore ratio, many large parts are efficient as spaced armor due to low powerscore for their size.

**Firestarter:** Pipetooth is underrated and the other plows about as good as lunatic's, has large size parts which are light weight making them useful as spaced armor.

So, to answer your question fully, if you want to be tanky then you will want to level both scavenger and steppenwolf mostly in parallel with each other, both sharing top priority together but maybe level scavenger higher because it has plows while steppenwolf has no plows at all, but you may also want to prioritize lunatic for its frames, after that is up to you to decide whether you want twinblades from nomad or structure parts from dawn children."

Okay that is a fair point, I can see that. However that goes both ways, now those hovers won't be able to shoot over cover in those same locations, instead of being able to back up to shoot over the train, you'll have to go around it instead. This actually means less locations to peekaboo with because you won't be peeking over those cover locations vertically, only horizontally. Also lower ground clearance makes it a lot easier to scrape against the ground when driving over bumps which can really mess up a hover's aim, especially for the heavier hovers that wobble a lot.

>remain nimble as ever

So you weren't around to see hovers on their release then I take it? Hovers are nowhere near what they used to be when it comes to ground clearance, acceleration AND durability. You used to be able to drive over those trains like they weren't even there."
Crossout,ffgksdm,t1_ffgblv1,1579908516.0,"This is a common misconception. Power score is not a good number, higher powerscore does not mean ""better"", it actually means ""bigger""

Matchmaking is based on powerscore and pairs you with enemies of rougly the same powerscore, rewards do not scale up with increased powerscore either. This means PS is not a ladder but is more like one side of a balancing scale with the opposing side being weighed down by whatever other limitation weighs the most on your build such as durability, mass limit or tonnage. (durability in most cases)

Basically what I am saying is, minimize the powerscore of your builds while simultaniously maximizing durability. You want to aim for the best ratio of durability to powerscore that you can while staying within a healthy tonnage. Steppenwolf and Scavenger parts for example have a more efficient durability vs powerscore ratio than other faction parts at the cost of having extra mass, if you have the spare tonnage, you could swap out a lunatic 4x4 plate for a scavenger 4x4 plate and have more health at the same powerscore.

If you set a limit for yourself to being below a certain powerscore, you can then optimize the build by swapping pieces in an effort to maximize the amount of health you can have at that powerscore. This is a healthy exercise for building all types of builds, even if you choose not to limit your powerscore (clan war build for instance) you still want to maximize the amount of durability to mass ratio, which is the same process but using mass as a limiting factor instead of PS.

For example here's [a build of mine](https://i.imgur.com/VJSak09.png) which is currently limited by mass limit, I was originally aiming for 7999PS, but I reached the mass limit and started optimizing parts based on durability/mass ratio with higher priority over durability/PS ratio, before optimization this build was at a higher powerscore than it is now and had about 170ish less structure. It may not sound like much but I've survived multiple matches with less than 100hp remaining and would've died without optimizing powerscore to the fullest potential."

warcraft3,fenhf0w,t3_epqmkw,1579284747.0,"Lol I played this map last night, only one play session but here's my take on it, there isn't very much to spend gold on, like you only advance tiers you don't upgrade the units at all. So naturally you spend the gold on items and try to make your hero beefy.

There's an item that gives 10 armor  and is very cheap so I just bought a bunch of those along with a fire orb for splash damage and an item that grants magic immunity. Having 40 armor and magic immunity is pretty insane, I didn't see mask of death or anything to grant life leech, if there isn't any then that is a good thing as it would've made me unkillable.

I was a demon hunter maxing out evasion 1st to be even more durable and was just brawling in the thick of it, I was pretty much unstoppable, players kept seeing me at ""low health"" and trying to block me with units but they would melt to the splash damage combined with immolation.

For units I went with dryads, naturally. The slow poison and magic immunity felt so strong i didn't see any need to advance to higher tiers. Nothing could kill me until one of the enemies got steam tanks, but the tanks could not shoot air units and one of my teammates went chimera and just flew over his army to destroy his base while my units slowed the tanks down in a base race.

All that being said, still more balance than Frenzy, but to be fair frenzy is less balanced than a seesaw with elephant and a toddler."

I think one of them was trying to render glitch me because they were spamming SVD shots from real far away directly at me through the walls, my squad mate who had just logged in followed the sound of the sniper, killed him and stole one of their trucks. meanwhile I died trading lives with the guy who was talking trash in voice chat and accidentally pressed respawn in the sector instead of shelter but was hilariously lucky because i found their 3rd vehicle on the way there, my squadmate hid his truck and i drove mine to a distant garage we had locked up. By the time we got back we couldn't find anyone and they hadn't even looted all of their own corpses, so we ended up getting like 4 good vests out of it.

First off, to answer your question it's 16, apollo generator provides 4 energy and the highest energy cabin is 12. Now that we have that out of the way forget it because we are going to talk about fatties. (fatmen will henceforth be called ""fatties"") This weapon is fun to play and performs well against most types of weapons within it's power score range and I'd argue (with bias of ofc) that it is also very fun to play against, no shenanigans at play here you just shoot the enemy and do your best to out maneuver them.

**Play style:** Most other cannons in the game are ideal for sniping at a considerable distance but not fatties, they are the most aggressive cannon in the game by design, its bonus is based on not missing the target in order shoot faster, this combined with having a low accuracy means getting up close and personal and the weapon's high structure reinforces that idea. You can face can face off with enemies using the weapon as armor even in many situations, but to truly unlock the potential of this weapon you need to be fast to reach the enemy quickly and have the ability to drive circles around them to avoid their weapon fire, get behind enemies and try not to stop moving, ramming is temping but it's best to circle the enemies and only do it when you feel it is worth it. Keep switching directions to be unpredictable, turn your vehicle to assist your weapon's rotation and do not stop turning to shoot. Aggressive builds need to be fast and durable which is what I consider a ""medium"" build, as in not a light or heavy build, understanding this helps decide the ideal types of cabins and movement types, ruling out many of the potential options, here are some tips on helping you create your fatty build and optimizing it properly.

**Power score:** I used to play around 7k PS but due to the recent PS scaling changes I think the ideal range is to play around 7.5-8k as the build starts sacrificing a lot of survivability lower down.

**Cabin options:** Bat is the best blue cabin, Harpy and Echo are the best purple cabins. Personally I prefer harpy because it is fast enough to outrun melee players, but echo offers much greater survivability and potential dps output. When using bat cabin, instead of resorting to using gas gen to reach 13 energy I prefer apollo and spending the extra energy on a detector) Why is bat the only blue option? because it is the best medium cabin, wyvern is the closest thing to a medium cabin besides bat, growl is a good light cabin but it is super squishy (this game really needs more medium cabins with similar stats to the bat.)

**Energy:** Use colossus engine and the smallest generator possible to reach 13 energy, avoid gas generator at all costs. Don't bother with chameleon, you don't need to hide from enemy, the enemy needs to hide from you. 

**Movement:** Bigfoot are the best, don't be a track user that's for slow heavy playstyle which is not as effective but more importantly less fun! For blue my personal choices are APC, large or twin wheels. I don't play tracks enough to make any suggestions, wheels builds are more fun than track builds.

**Ammo:** Don't use blue ammo boxes, the purple boxes are durable enough to be used as armor, if you are playing cannons you should be getting purple ammo boxes immediately, personally I have 2x purple boxes which are both fused for increased capacity. Harpy cabin only needs 1 box if it's fused, for echo cabin you need a 2nd box (Do not fuse anything unless you can afford it and fully understand what you are getting yourself into) For those that do fuse their ammo boxes, I recommend getting at least one fused for increased capacity, fusing the 2nd an unnecessary luxury for this build.

**My builds:** (PC only) Search ""BigFug"" on the exhibition and you'll find the echo build and any others that I upload, the older versions were out of date after the recent changes to collision for the fatman model which prevented the front cannon from turning so I took them down, I will maybe try to make some lower PS version using a bat cabin again, The harpy cabin version is not on the exhibition yet as there are some things I can improve still, but [I am very happy with its performance so far.](https://youtu.be/KFPTvK-NOSQ)"

As cool as the feature is, it needs to be supported by other features like not allowing you to control bots if you die too early or only allow players to take control of bots if they meet certain conditions like based on the score or something, and allow living players to give orders to bots such as ""hold position"", ""follow me"", ""defend our objective"", ""attack the objective"", etc in order to give players the ability to preserve their bots so that a human has a chance control it before it gets itself killed in a dumb way."

Quite often you'll see someone die using every bot before you even have a chance to die once yourself, getting mad at people for ""wasting bots"" is a common occurrence. I'd like this feature a lot more if it didn't feel like it rewards you for dying before your teammates.
