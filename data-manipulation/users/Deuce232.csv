So in the real life version of the game I can describe what this comment would like like.

""I roll a perception check to see how interested u/ourbase is in the subject.""

So I just told god that my character wants to use his perception to judge the situation.  My character has stats (numbers) that determine his qualities.  Since I have good stats in perception and I rolled a good numbers on my dice it is going to succeed almost always.

So since you are a non-player character in this example.  God tells me I succeed in my effort at perception and tells me how interested you appear.

Another example would be if I was talking to a shopkeeper trying to get information I might roll for 'persuasion'.  This time I roll very poorly so god tells me that the shopkeeper is only willing to give me a small discount.

The same is true for combat.  ""I shoot my bow"" then roll to see how well you did that.  Then god tells you how that affected the world."
