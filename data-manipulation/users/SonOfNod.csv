economy,ffdla0z,t3_eszqte,1579823282.0,I remember when the United Way raise BILLIONS of dollars after 9/11. They just held on to it for years until victims’ groups sued and won that the United way had to pay out at least some of the money.
economy,ffdl4p2,t3_esevpo,1579823191.0,"Yea, that’s got about a 100% chance of fraud somewhere with money having the flux that much."
AskReddit,ff21zqf,t3_eqzdrn,1579491643.0,“Oh I’ve seen this one.” ... wait did you say less awkward or more awkward?

gatech,fdpnkl6,t3_emko4g,1578633803.0,"Yes, it was on the north side of campus in a very non descript building. They had to decommission it for the '96 Olympics. After that the reactor and building it was housed in was torn down and the Ford building was built in its place."
LifeProTips,fdoxqfy,t3_emc893,1578615283.0,Where is this link located in Facebook?
Economics,fdjv286,t1_fdil97v,1578488452.0,So it isn’t just the oil producers. If you want to fix the problem then you really need to look at taxing oil products. And even within this category not all products are made equal. If you look at the fuels used in shipping and large cruise ships it is disproportionately awful for the environment. A solution implemented needs to attack the problem. Making an industry out to be villains doesn’t solve the problem. Creating economic incentives for solutions does.
todayilearned,fddvo53,t3_ektb9t,1578325114.0,"I love all the tree planting around the world. However, in some parts of the world (not Finland) wild native grasses can be more beneficial https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs143_010044.pdf. If you live in such an area please consider keeping a section of your property with wild native grasses and do not cut this area. Even relatively small areas can help with pollination of the larger region."
Economics,fddj8r7,t1_fdcov9f,1578314466.0,This is specifically why the US auto industry was saved in the last recession. There are so many sub suppliers that would go bankrupt if that much of their business went away overnight. It would send the manufacturing industry into depression.

deloitte,fczp42h,t3_ejkvkc,1578106085.0,"If you are doing commercial consulting then you can kiss the idea of a 40-45 hour work week away. At best you’ll only do 40-45 client hours. Then you have travel, firm initiatives, etc. This is at any Big 4 or MBB. A slow week in consulting will be 55 hours (assuming you are staffed). A typical week is 60-70 depending on if you have a direct flight or not."
SecurityAnalysis,fczgax5,t3_ejkt8c,1578100615.0,"We first had a full inversion of the yield curve in March of 2019. Based on historical results (https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/13/after-yield-curve-inverts-stocks-typically-have-18-months-before-doom.html) we should expect to see the start of a recession in 20-24 months. Based on this I'd expect us to be in recession in Q4 2020 or Q1 2021. Of course, this isn't a steadfast rule. Who knows when the next one will be. People have been predicting it for 10 years now."
nottheonion,fczdn8l,t3_ejjx8o,1578098846.0,I feel like this is a bad Onion article about the Y2K bug being 20 years late.

history,fcudg46,t3_eiuljs,1577978369.0,"If you are going for straight oldest bar then that would be Sean’s Bar in Ireland that was founded in 900 AD https://www.bucketlistbars.com/news-articles2/107-5-oldest-bars-in-the-world. However, restaurants have been around at least since the ancient https://quatr.us/romans/roman-restaurants-going-eat-ancient-rome.htm#content. In ancient cities kitchens weren’t a common thing for urban homes. As a result, you had communal eating areas and the concept of restaurants form fairly early in civilization."

gadgets,fco6b16,t1_fcnpcyv,1577824900.0,So the issue isn’t lifting 200lb once. It is lifting it 200+ times every day for decades. It’s super easy to develop back problems. Right now most warehouses will limit single object lifts to under 100lb.
business,fcnp4ls,t1_fcnoau1,1577815765.0,If that were they case they wouldn’t need the confession.

This can be indefinitely. So yea, a lot of people just confess so that they can get on with their lives someday."
gatech,fcndx9x,t1_fcnbamu,1577809680.0,"Tuition at Tech is still a bargain compared to any other school in it's league (save Carnegie Mellon). That being said, college tuition as a whole is out of control."
gatech,fcnd4l4,t1_fcnabif,1577809159.0,They have grade replacement now. So you can recover a bad grade if you retake the course.
movies,fcn27bp,t3_ehx758,1577801178.0,Your gripe with Hollywood is exactly what lead Kevin Smith to make Clerks. He didn't feel like movies were being made for or about the people he knew. He discussed it in an interview.
business,fcmytn3,t1_fcmwde0,1577798014.0,I'm not sure you understand how the Japanese legal system works. For how modern Japan is their legal system is crazy backwards.
investing,fcmy1fi,t1_fcm9u8x,1577797179.0,In the US failure is almost seen as a badge of experience. Just the fact that you've tried before is what matters more.
RoomPorn,fcmbuyn,t1_fcm0lrk,1577769901.0,If it’s that big inside you are talking about a 787 or an A380. That jet is probably $150M-ish depending on outfitting. The new gulstream G650 is $65M and it does not have that kind of space inside.

Have you ever given thought to the concept of moving stars closer to our own? The idea of creating an interstellar community all in our “backyard”."
worldnews,fckuj09,t1_fckm2cl,1577733483.0,"Yea, I’ve seen people from western countries that grew up with servants doing everything. They never really figured out how to clean their own room. They get to university and they are a mess. No clue how to take care of themselves."

todayilearned,fcfyz22,t3_eh518h,1577635021.0,"There are a whole bunch of old holidays celebrated around the shortest day of the year. The Romans had Saturnalia. The Germanics had Yule (like Yule Log). So yea, the world was already in party mode around this time of year. Why not tack another holiday on."

gatech,fc7j1p5,t3_egk85z,1577508978.0,Before this there was a black remote control. They liked it to your previously registered number and you’d answer an A/B/C/D question to check in for attendance. Thanks for making me remember these dammed thing.
stocks,fc5vw6a,t1_fc5tnk0,1577467017.0,We could just go through a long period of 3-5% growth. In a couple of years valuations won’t look so rosy. This could be caused by a lack of buying as people build up cash and a slow draw down as people start to retire. 3% would pretty much be par with inflation. This situation for 5 years would more than correct and valuation issues in the market.
stocks,fc5rakd,t1_fc5il6i,1577464195.0,"The more people keep talking about the “inevitable crash” that’s just 3, 6, 9, or 12 months away the more I’m convinced it isn’t going to happen. The fact is that the more people believe something is going to happen in the near term to the market the less likely it is to happen."
business,fc39vit,t1_fc382mp,1577384980.0,"Patents are nice, but not exactly an instruction manual. Just because you read the patent doesn't mean you can reproduce it, or even build the thing in the first place."
Documentaries,fc216fj,t1_fc1y529,1577336391.0,"So in theory only the asbestos dust is bad for you. While he might be fine for a while given no one is disturbing a lot of it, the reporter was finding blue asbestos clumps on the street. Those fibers are getting into the air every time the wind blows. While I think that guy is awesome for his fuck it attitude I still think that he will die of lung cancer. It will take a few years though. If you look at the machinists that worked with asbestos in the states (arguably the most impacted during the period of the 30s-60s when asbestos was in use) it took them years to develop problems. But in the end the problems were always there :-(."
