Commit yourself to eating whatever they bring with no complaints and be sure to tip properly.  OR... go to a bar and let the bartender choose your drinks for you, but you have to drink whatever they choose without complaining.  In either scenario you also still have to pay full price plus tip regardless of whether you enjoyed it or not.


Honestly, if the bar or restaurant is good, that’s exactly what I’ll do, I want to see what they’ll choose that shows them off the best. It works at a place with a Michelin Star, not so much at Burger King.
