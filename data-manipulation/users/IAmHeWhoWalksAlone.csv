If he is not allowed to do X then never ever allow him to do X.  Once you let them do X, it'll always be ok for him to do X and telling him not to will just confuse.

They also need order (2) and structure (3).  Otherwise you're in for a world of stress.

I find these are the things that most people who I've met that gave up their dog or that regret getting them all lack those 3 basic things.

And remember, most mistakes he will make, will be YOUR fault.  Timeouts need to happen when you catch him in the act, not 3 minutes/hours later or after you're done laughing.  It is their job to explore the world and learn from you.  It is your job to feed, protect and teach them.

Enjoy the new puppy and all the love and beauty he is about to spend the rest of his life pouring into yours.



Edit: Pet insurance.  Get it!

I've said this in other posts and I'll say it again because it is well worth it.  Get pet insurance now, not after they get hurt.  The earlier you get it, the cheaper the monthly payments will be.  Danes get big and big dogs take big doses of everything, especially anesthesia if it is ever needed, and anesthesia is extremely expensive.  Pet insurance for your Dane will be worth every penny (times 2!) even if you never need it.  Get it.  Nothing makes life easier than knowing your ""kid"" will survive even if it means you will miss this month's mortgage payment (and a few other bills too), because you also know you'll be reimbursed and make that late payment."
