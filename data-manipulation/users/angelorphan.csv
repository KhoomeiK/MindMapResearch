AMA,ff6p5t0,t1_f9o7k1y,1579631966.0,"Hi,I am hardcore pacifist more than half century. 

(Born in 1966 in Japan,got post war education with free of choice,plus,my mother was little kid when Hiroshima happened 100 miles from her,ended up died with cancer with her sister.My parents were apolitical)

Sorry for found your AMA really late,I appreciate you and support you as pacifist.I will never criticize you.
Your kind of person,experienced war by yourself,physically,politically,and choose to be pacifist help pacifist movement.I admire you.

There are another kind of self-claimed pacifist in military I don't support..They say ""We military destroy enemy,in this way,we create peace.So I call myself pacifist""(I heard from one of them directly).I don't support only this kind of fake pacifist.(I don't think interventionism bring peace.)

I myself never experienced war physically.

But I have some experience as Japanese.
Back in 90's,when I visited Hong Kong,I went local foot massage.It was on rural area,they didn't have much Japanese customer.Young owner asked my age before when I made appointment.I wondered why.

Turned out,there was owner's father sitting in shop too.The father smiled to me.
I was forgiven because I did nothing directly.
I was filled with guilt for what Japan did to Hong Kong,So,his smile was blessing for me.

(I didn't have to choose stay away from the war.This is really fortunate.This is another reason to admire your choice.also,the forgiveness from an old man amazed me.I hope People like you,changed opinion can have conversation with former ""enemy"".)

Another one is not good memory...When I visited Singapore,I of course went to war museum.I did not get weird look,except--
a white couple,apparently tourist,looked at me,said ""Japanese..""

Talk about unwarranted criticism XD

After this AMA,we pacifist are hurt a lot.I think you hurt more than me because you are watching closely.

Again,I admire your courage.Sorry about my English."
