You are invalidating victims based of a difficult decision made in an incredibly stressful situation.

There are so many reasons why people don't report these things.

I never reported what happened of me because he made sure to destroy the evidence. I told 3 people and one of them let it out. I lost friends and was tormented by people calling me a whore, attention seeker, people telling me I deserved it or I should have 'just broken up with him'. When these things get out victims lives get a million times harder so a lot of people just let it go for the sake of a quiet life.

They happened. They are valid. Those statistics matter. Whether you want to acknowledge them as real, they were very real to those victims.

Does that mean the abuse never happened? No. It happened but the only evidence I have is PTSD.

If you are assaulted on a busy train then CCTV won't have seen it. If you don't make a scene then no one else would know. Does that mean it never happened? No. It just means that there would have been no outcome from reporting it besides meaningless paperwork and wasted time from interviews. Sometimes it's just easier and better for you to just move past it but it still happened.

Not only that but they are equally reported. That doesn't meant they happen equally. Sexual assault is only reported ~25% of the time where as assault is reported ~80% of the time.
