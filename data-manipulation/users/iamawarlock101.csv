Go over who was there, how you felt, how it affected you for a short and long period of time, how you reacted, etc.  Relic the situation but not from your perspective.

You can reply with any questions or anythinf and ill get back as soon as I can,however I may not always have an answer.

I like to believe that he lets your soul into another body if you havent fufilled your full potential or lived the life he meant for you.  That its all about trusting your instinct and living life to the fullest.  Its quite calming for me, however its not for everyone.

What I dont endorse, however, is cutting.  If you cut too deep you could bleed out.  In therapy I was taught RICE.  you can put a rubber band around your wrist and just snap it.
