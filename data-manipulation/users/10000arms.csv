magick,ff8u1d7,t1_ff8s1gw,1579696063.0,"I understand exactly what you mean by “feeling” something. The other day I was out walking around and I noticed that someone was cutting back some of the woods and there was some debris left behind, including a big stick of bamboo just laying there in my path. Instantly I was like, Huh. I should make a bamboo spear. So I went home, grabbed a hedge cutter and a pocket knife, and walked back to make it. I sat in the grass for a solid 45 minutes sawing off the leaves and sharpening it, and I just felt very at peace. It’s always satisfying to make something with my hands, especially if it comes from nature, even if it’s kind of impulsive and impractical. A lot of the time I just get those random feelings and connections to nature."
AskReddit,ff799y1,t3_es1ps9,1579643714.0,"Cry, panic, call my mom, ask her what to do, hyperventilate, meanwhile I’ve lost the spider and I worry that it will pull a sneak attack/lay eggs/go in my room, put on the nearest pair of shoes, look around for a large thing to whack with, find a rolled up yoga mat laying against the wall, brandish it menacingly, walk around the house for a while like some sort of maniac, and eventually calm down when my dad gets home and I accept that it’s gone."

Paranormal,ff30phl,t3_er6udf,1579530551.0,"I don't know about what you encountered, but I can tell you that any time I've had paranormal contact I've felt exactly that exhaustion you described. A couple of years ago an ex-friend convinced me to use a ouija board with her in my house. Nothing really ""happened"" as far as intelligible words or stuff falling off of shelves or anything like that, but once we decided to stop, I felt very tired and uneasy, like something was just sucking the energy out of me. The whole room felt tense and still, and I couldn't shake that feeling for the rest of the afternoon."
writers,ff2zsov,t3_er5hh5,1579529794.0,"It can be really difficult sometimes to just put words on the page because you feel like it's not good enough, but eventually you have to write something, anything. A lot of the time it's because you lack that spark of inspiration, so you don't really feel that push and that excitement to write something that you feel is really great. Until you find that spark, *force yourself to write*. It can literally be nonsense, it can be complete garbage, but you have to do it. Set a timer for like 5 minutes and just free write on paper (I've found it helps me focus better than typing). Or go find your inspiration. Listen to new music. Go somewhere you've never been. Watch a movie. Pick up a random book. But do *not* let ""writer's block"" stop you, because if you succumb to it, you'll just use it as an excuse to let your creativity waste away."
socialanxiety,ff2zblu,t3_erawyl,1579529393.0,This is why I like to listen to music when I walk. If people laugh at me I can't hear them. If someone greets me I can't hear them. I walk faster and with more confidence. I'm thinking less about how I look and more about the music and my body's rhythm.

AskReddit,ff2ycud,t3_erc1ft,1579528540.0,"I had a girlfriend whose issues were too much for me to deal with at times. I felt trapped because I felt like I couldn't give her advice without her rejecting it or feeling like I didn't know enough about the situation (she had an eating disorder and abusive parents, which I've never dealt with). I emphasized that I was there to give my best advice but that at a certain point I'm not the person to talk to because I'm not a professional and I simply don't know enough to really help."

WritingPrompts,ff1g1hn,t3_er3pr2,1579478650.0,"I read a book like this! It was a long time ago and I can’t remember the title, but it was about a guy who woke up one morning and turned invisible, then basically befriended a blind girl while he was trying to figure his life out. I can’t remember much else. I don’t think I actually finished the book, but now I wish I had and I hope I can find it again."

socialanxiety,fesc1p5,t3_eqhzpt,1579363711.0,Good luck dude. However I would advise that you eat unless you really feel like you’ll just puke it up. Makes me feel comfortable in a way during those types of situations.
