BlackPeopleTwitter,ffdiead,t1_ffcxnxu,1579821518.0,"I at least feel okay about the last company I worked for in construction. One of our admin’s father worked for a different construction company. He fell through a rotted roof that wasn’t properly inspected and his employer tried to shaft him on worker’s compensation. Meanwhile our company heard from his daughter so we raised over $5,000 to help with insurance co-pay and his rent for a few months. We sent it on to other companies to raise more for outpatient physical therapy, too. 

Never heard if his last company got any kind of reprimand, but his daughter was a super loyal employee."

There are a lot of reasons I don’t work there anymore."
AskReddit,ff635cx,t1_ff4ps2a,1579617956.0,"Nah, the solidarity is appreciated. I’ve experienced sexism myself and had to rely on a male colleague to vouch for me before. I think because it was my employee, and I tended to be protective of my team, it got to me worse.

And yes, the Marine comment nearly made me blow a gasket. So much for Semper Fidelis for that guy. That said, over the next few years she did have plenty of other customers who did respect her service and even bonded with her over shared experiences in the service. We typically had customers for 6-12 weeks depending on the project, customization, etc. so there were some we got to know very well and connected well with. I hope this one guy didn’t stick with her as much as it stuck with me."

AskReddit,ff3og8f,t3_ergjyj,1579545420.0,"Residential construction. I was a new manager of a shift of about 6-7 customer service reps. We were used to some crazy customers who would even forget what they bought or accuse us not knowing the “special deal” they had with their sales rep. It was an every day occurrence. The customer service folks all had assigned sales reps they worked with. It usually led to good communication and the sales reps, who made great commission, weren’t shy about showering their customer service reps with gifts and lunches as a thank you for making sure the job was filed, ordered, billed, scheduled and completed right. 

(This is past tense only because I don’t work there anymore.  And I’ll try to clarify my subject without naming names.)


One fucker in particular, though, made me irate. He was downright verbally abusive to the girl who assisted his sales rep. We had an open office and I came out of a meeting to see her on the phone with tears in her eyes while a loud man shouted in the phone. She was an extremely proud woman and had gone through a lot of shit in life so I was surprised to see her emotional. She was known to take a lot of verbal abuse from customers, though, without shutting them down. It was more from fear of asserting herself and pissing them off further. So I walked over and mouthed to her “hang up the phone.”

She shook her head at me. I heard the guy yelling obscenities. Walked around to look at her screen to see his profile. His sales rep was not one known to have problem customers because he communicated well up front. Everything looked straight forward about his contract. 

She had tears down her eyes so I took the phone out of her hand and just said “Okay you have the manager now. What is the problem Mr. ______?”

He exploded. Said I couldn’t be the manager and how ignorant my employee was. That she couldn’t possibly know as much about construction as him and we were trying to rip him off. He was slurring and incoherent, so I figured likely a drunk. (Again not our first customer to call us up after drinking too much.)

He started cussing and I interrupted and said “SIR YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN. DO NOT CALL BACK UNTIL YOU CAN HAVE A CIVIL DISCUSSION.” I hung up.

Told the employee to take a long lunch today. He called back and I deleted his subsequent voicemails off her phone until he stopped after about 20 minutes/4 more calls. 

I called the sales rep who was genuinely shocked to hear how he was being. He said he’ll talk to the customer and try to see what the root of the issue was and calm him down. He called back about an hour later just as baffled. Said the guy was sweet as could be with him but had said he “didn’t appreciate being yelled at” by me. The rep thought everything was good and the man seemed very calm and polite. So I picked up the phone and called him back myself. I guess Mr. Hyde picked up the phone instead of Dr. Jekyll because we were back to cussing and screaming. I was a “fucking smug bitch.” My blood was boiling by this point but I was on a company cell phone from one of the few enclosed offices in the building. So I walked out back into the warehouse away from my team. The warehouse guys saw me do this sometimes when I had to speak more bluntly than the example I wanted to set for my team. 

As he is screaming at me he said shouts “I AM AN INJURED MARINE DON’T YOU FUCKING TRY TO PULL A FAST ONE ON ME.” I lost it and screamed “SO THE FUCK IS SHE, YOU HYPOCRITE.” 

His response? “THOSE AREN’T REAL MARINES!” (Read: women.)


If I had the ability to breathe fire, that would’ve probably been the time to find out. The warehouse guys saw and immediately ran inside to ask around who I was talking to and what did they do. Everyone quickly knew this was a “crazy customer.”

The yelling and berating went on but every time a male colleague called on our behalf he pulled the nice guy act and swore he didn’t want to cancel his contract. My own GM asked me to really detach myself from my team and review phone calls to see what the original girl might’ve done wrong to offend the guy. I listened to the recorded calls multiple times but from what I could tell she really stuck to her training. 

I reassigned him to the 1 male customer service agent we had on the same shift. That guy and the original girl were actually very close friends, partly bonded by both being veterans trying to re-enter civilian life. So he initially didn’t want to take the customer. He was also only 2 weeks into the job and still studying a lot of the technical information about our process and product. I told him “I just want to test a theory.”

I downloaded the recordings of her original phone conversations with the guy and wrote the word-for-word sentences she had said to him, essentially making a script for the male customer service agent. 

I also told him I’d be available on our office chat to talk him through any questions he didn’t know the answers to. 

The customer? Sweet as pie.

Made multiple joking comments how the original girl didn’t know what she was talking about and how weird it was we had girls working in construction. 

It was massively uncomfortable but the male agent decided he would try his hardest to get a positive review because he knew, based on sales rep assignment, it would actually show for his teammate’s stats that quarter. And he did. He got a 10/10. The customer told me that the male employee “should be running the place” and “should get a raise.”

I was still angry deep down but proud of my employees for sticking together. I’d seen it before at another construction company when sales versus office versus field production don’t have each other’s backs with difficult customers. In this case the sales rep, installer, and both customer service agents weren’t accusatory with each other. 

As much as I would’ve loved to pull the plug on that guy’s job, it would’ve cost us $40k in sales. 

I did have to have a difficult talk with the first girl, who was still upset with herself for not being able to “save” the situation. We talked in private and I told her she absolutely couldn’t have fixed that guy, and it was no reflection on her. Her sales rep had heard about what happened after the customer was reassigned and felt so bad he brought her in lunch, flowers, and sent her a heartfelt email about how much he appreciated her hard work and having her as his customer service agent, how lucky he feels that he can trust issues will get fixed because of her work ethic, etc. 

But I’ll be damned if that customer’s name isn’t still etched in my brain. I hope life shits all over him.

The company had a lot of good reviews, bad reviews, difficult or “saved” customers over the years. But I found the hardest to be the good reviews you felt were phony or from people who were assholes the whole way through. It almost felt dirty getting their praise."
