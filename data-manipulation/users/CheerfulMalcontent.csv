ChronicPain,fdmd1vp,t1_fdlz8eh,1578546012.0,"Gods I’d love to fire her but I’m stuck with Veterans Hospital red tape.

Edit: I also do try to advocate for myself as best I can, but I run into the problem of “googling does not a medical degree make”. I understand that to a point but when I’m up at night, unable to sleep I read medical journal articles, study maps of the human bones/tissues/nerves and research imaging and therapy advances. I also study the effects that pain-induced insomnia have on brain function and cell regeneration/healing. It’s how I finally got dxed with the tear in my labrum. Turns out begging for a huge needle shoved into my hip socket without any anesthetic suddenly makes my pain not seem drug-seeking behavior even though I’ve literally never asked or expected an opiate prescription (nerve pain and other deep joint pain doesn’t respond to them very well anyway, and I can’t handle most opiates as it is so I don’t expect them)

But I get so exhausted always trying to convince them to just run tests let alone prescribe anything other than Tylenol."
notebooks,fdlt0as,t3_elzw57,1578531788.0,"These are actually my preferred journal now (the better graded paper one) they beat out LT and Moleskin IMO for lack of ghosting, smearing, and paper quality. The down sides are the ribbon markers are CHEAP and thin, and I’ve noticed sometimes the dots are off center between pages, but for the price they can’t be beat."
ChronicPain,fdlspvu,t1_fdktr3w,1578531593.0,"My dad was finally convinced that a total knee replacement would, if not cure his pain, bring it down from debilitating to simply annoying. It’s been a year and a half and he STILL can’t go up or down stairs. He keeps saying how he wished he’d not gotten the replacement at all, as now he has other problems due to the surgery and healing that he didn’t before. It’s a mixed bag."
ChronicPain,fdlsg6e,t1_fdkhlge,1578531410.0,I’m 34. They won’t even consider repairing the visible labral tear I have in my hip because I’m “too young” to be considered for surgery.
ChronicPain,fdlscok,t1_fdiz4b8,1578531343.0,"I challenged my doc about that, actually. She said to be “pain-free” in chronic pain patients wasn’t reasonable or feasible. 

Also, opiates are STRICTLY for post-op and cancer patients, according to her. Everyone else is in LESS PAIN than post-op and cancer patients. 

I gave up arguing with her on that point since even by her definition I wasn’t “functional”. I got terfed to a chronic pain group in the mental health clinic that I couldn’t attend regularly enough to actually maintain my enrollment in."
ChronicPain,fdlrnvk,t3_em0pcd,1578530874.0,"“Are there yoga positions that don’t require flexed pressure on my wrists, knees, or hips? Where there is no torque or shearing pressure or straining under movement? I mean, other than Corpse Pose?”

I like Corpse Pose, though I need to have my feet flat on the ground and knees bent to take pressure off my lower back."
realwitchcraft,fdixznm,t3_ell2yt,1578453611.0,"Your oven (if you have one) is fire proof. You can light your slip of paper on fire, put it in a flame proof bowl or pan (cast iron is awesome but a Pyrex glass mixing bowl or ceramic pot works perfectly) and put the bowl in the oven. Close the door or not your choice. I second the use of either flash paper (magic shops sell it) or tissue paper as it goes up fast and without a lot of smoke."

TooAfraidToAsk,fdigpup,t3_elg1a9,1578442520.0,"I’ll be 35 in March and I sleep with a stuffed alpaca. I’ve always had a stuffed animal to squeeze at night except for when I was in Basic Training. (But then I had a rolled up “woobie” or soft poncho liner). 

You’re never too old to find comfort in a soft, cuddly thing. Anyone who teases you (or worse) deserves a good mouth slap (or worse). 

Also, note that there’s no exceptions or qualifiers here. You could have had the most charmed and blissfully innocent childhood and I’d still say the same thing. We all deserve a comfort object."
ChronicPain,fdifd6b,t1_fdieoc4,1578441642.0,"Yeah I stopped mentioning it after a while. I have a mood dysregulation disorder as it is and as a female chronic pain patient I kept being ignored and told it was “just” depression and to go see mental health. 

Now I describe my “bad days” as hammer days. Sometimes my joints hurt so much I actively fantasize about taking a ball peen hammer to them to crush the entire joint. At least then they’d have something to fix (broken bone) and feel like I’d be worth their time. 

My doctors don’t understand my coping humor."
ChronicPain,fdie3g9,t1_fdi3g43,1578440822.0,"“Our goal isn’t to make you ‘pain-free’ but to manage it so you can ‘function’ [eg work a job, attend school, etc].” Prescribes me 4g of Tylenol a day for the rest of my life. (I’d recently been fired from my job and flunked out of college both because of my chronic pain/illness)

This was my doctor’s response when I told her that sometimes my pain gets so unbearable I actively consider killing myself. Pain may not “kill” like cancer does, but i definitely wouldn’t be suicidal if I WASNT in pain."

memes,fd80s0p,t1_fd7npbs,1578212587.0,"You’re getting some good natured (or otherwise) ribbing, but the meat of your reply is valid. Sometimes it’s difficult to hash out texture preferences, and it’s not fair for other to grill you on them. I can’t stand wet chicken and I find myself unnecessarily defending that way too often, for example. Don’t let jerks get you down."
