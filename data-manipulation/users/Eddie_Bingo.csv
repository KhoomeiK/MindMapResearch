selfimprovement,ff43j34,t1_ff41jmu,1579554753.0,"Not that I can think of, really it's just me who thinks about it because I don't like talking about myself and my opinions on myself in public because everyone's really too polite to tell me to shut the fuck up, so they listen to my spiel and all I've done is waste their time. At least here you can ignore/hide my post."
selfimprovement,ff43cly,t1_ff3oyb7,1579554641.0,"First off, I want to thank you for your response. I know that you put work into it, and I'm sorry that it's been put into helping me. But more importantly, I really do want you to know that I appreciate you trying to help, even though I've probably ended up taking up more time than I'm worth, but thank you for wanting to help me.

I don't particularly want to go to a therapist for really the same reason I was hoping for a shorter response to this; I'm just not worth the time. The therapist is qualified, and probably has other people to see who it would be more worth to help. Me going to a therapist wastes three people's time: my own, because I know I'm not going to change because I'm really past the point of no return; the Therapist's because their talents are better spent helping people who can still recover, as opposed to hearing me bitch and moan about how much of a piece of shit I am; and the person who would've taken my time for the same reasons as the therapist (sort of).

I wouldn't say I have self esteem issues because I really just don't deserve to think of myself as important considering how useless I am. I am really a horrible person because all I do is bitch and moan and I know I'm too lazy to do anything about it. Which would make loving myself even worse, because at least if I hate me too then someone will do the decent thing and make sure that I don't start thinking what I'm doing is good.

Speaking of me being lazy, I'd say that I am because I can never bring myself to do anything that requires work. (For example all the suggestions given by others in the comments). Whenever something of effort needs to be done by me, it always takes me three times to length of a normal person, and I'll only do the bare minimum because I know that even if I did really try it wouldn't be any better than what I've done with as little effort as possible.

I don't think I have depression, because really the last thing I need is an excuse for all my shitty behaviour. And also there are probably people worse off than me who really do have depression and really do need help, and the last thing they need is some shithead who thinks that because they're a piece of shit, it gives them the right to think that they have a reason for it other than just being useless.

Your reply was helpful though, at least it gave me something to read and think about; which is more than most things, even if the only thing I realized is that I really don't deserve any help. And if you decide to not reply to me after reading this then that's OK. But I would like you to know I really appreciate the effort you went to in order to try and help."

But for the past few years whenever anything good happened to me all I could think about is how I've done, nor will ever do, anything to earn it. Can you explain what you mean by a mirror for me to look in to? I really don't think it's that my parents don't give me enough time, if anything they give me too much considering how little time I'm worth."
selfimprovement,ff41cas,t1_ff3vf7a,1579553399.0,Thanks
selfimprovement,ff41bb7,t1_ff3vcxo,1579553383.0,"Not really, a few years ago when I started to learn more about global affairs I was able to agknowlage the fact that my problems don't matter in the grand scheme of things. So whenever I found something irritating I just told myself to shut the fuck up and try to think of others who have it worse than me. This eventually lead to me shouting at myself in the mirror whenever I think about my life because I'm just squandering everything I've been given, despite the fact I've done nothing to earn them. So all I do is distract myself by doing stupid things just so that I don't have to think of how much of a piece of shit I am."

Then you can just parry heavy, or just heavy if you time it right because he goes unstoppable when using his heavy and the opp isn't shocked. Add the special two into the mix for more damage, and you've pretty much just won."

ContestOfChampions,fc9bw4p,t1_fc9b69b,1577550275.0,"Well for Magik I'd recommend pushing her over a bar of power. That way she gets limbo and will most likely wake up, then I'd say push Quake to one bar of power. She will throw it at the worst possible time. Every. Fucking. Time. Be sure to not be great at dodging it. That will always fucking work, for me anyway. As for Ghost, throwing her across the room in a forwards direction will take her out of phase, and she'll wake up."
