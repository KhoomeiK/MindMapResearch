mildlyinteresting,ffk4uoq,t1_ffk38zr,1580015911.0,I saw a video about making reusable bags from plastic bags. That’s a really good idea and I might do that but we have cats and I end up using those for litter. I have way too many plastic pill bottles though. I always thought it would be really easy to blow them into safety glasses for kids

AmItheAsshole,ffcqlnu,t3_esrtrc,1579805183.0,YTA. He wouldn’t have “quit” if you hadn’t fired him. He’s clearly working very hard and not being compensated enough for it (judging by his level of stress freak out). There’s no way he would have ever spoke up about anything if you hadn’t fired him. That was brewing inside him already but was keeping his mouth shut for the money. Swallowing your pride and frustration to pay the bills is real. And you just shit on him after being a good employee and being quiet about it. You’re a shite employer.
