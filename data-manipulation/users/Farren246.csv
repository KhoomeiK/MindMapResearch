Because you seem to be of the mind that love is something that can only ever be felt for one single person, instead of something that can be started and nurtured to grow between anyone. Literally lock two people in a house together, come back in 5 years and those people will be inseparable. That's just how the human brain works.

In any case, your position seems to be that once someone feels love, they cannot feel that for anyone else regardless of circumstance. If that were true, your position would make sense. But the truth is that you can develop feelings for other people, and it would be logical for them to each put effort in to developing feelings for someone age appropriate rather than to pursue each other."

AMD teases 5700 series: Nvidia readies RTX 2070 Super.

2070 Super released with close to 2080 performance: 2080 price falls.    
2070 Super costs what 2070 used to cost, with better performance: 2070 price falls.    
Lowered 2070 now costs the same as 5700XT: 5700XT price falls (slightly... they are similar performers).    
Seeing 5700XT prices approach 5700, retailers preemptively lower vanilla 5700 price.
