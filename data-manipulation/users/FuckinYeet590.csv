niceguys,fdb2f7i,t1_fd7ewi3,1578252984.0,"This was after I said I was 14 about 3 times, which I think is worse"
niceguys,fd7d6it,t1_fd60s4x,1578202634.0,"He was respectful on Omegle. We considered each other friends because of our conversation. He even used the argument that he was so respectful, and insinuated that I owed him a fucking picture of my tits because of that. I should probably just stop trying to be friendly altogether."
niceguys,fd4xvrc,t1_fd4xjy7,1578172187.0,"I don’t ask people’s information. If I don’t tell them mine then I don’t ask theirs. All I can do is block them, take screenshots, and humiliate them on my page."
niceguys,fd4wap9,t1_fd45tsd,1578171630.0,"It won’t do a thing. He lives in India, but I do have screenshots of our conversation"

niceguys,fd1asd1,t1_fd1abfk,1578129287.0,"I always know that these people never win in life. I’ve seen it happen with my own eyes, so I know they’re never going to be happy."
niceguys,fd19wsz,t3_ejudyp,1578128958.0,"This was a friend I met on Omegle. Now, a little backstory about me, I’m 14. I’ve been getting nasty messages, dick pics, and sexual harassment since I was ten years old. I’ve also been molested twice. People have attempted to manipulate, blackmail, and threaten to rape me. I have big, big trust issues with men. I try to be friendly, but I am always cautious with my information. He was very respectful at first, but then he started being rude. He called me chubby, then said he liked me. I told him I was 14 (for like the 3rd time), and he said that he was 16 (not 19, or 22, like he had previously told me). I rejected his demands to sext me and flirt with me, and he got aggressive. He threatened me, and then said I’d be tortured. He said that I had no right to reject him because I was single. I’ve blocked him, but I think he got ahold of my Twitter and other social media accounts."

creepyPMs,fcyiu86,t1_fcx4vbm,1578080770.0,My mom can relate. She’s been harassed by many over the years since she divorced my dad. She always tells me about it all because she knows I deal with the same things.
creepyPMs,fcyilp3,t1_fcyfxwe,1578080644.0,Are you saying my mom deserves this shit because she’s older? Or are you saying my mom is undesirable?
