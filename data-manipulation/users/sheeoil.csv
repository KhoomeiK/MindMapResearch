aww,ff6gb9a,t1_ff525te,1579626575.0,"I had a dog named Charlie. His sidekicks name was Belle. Of course, she was a Bassett hound not a cat."
aww,feywxgj,t1_fevrcd4,1579451522.0,"His owners DNA tested him, and he's a mix of six breeds. No havanese, but the most dominant was shih tzu and there was poodle, Pomeranian, Maltese, and two others I can't remember. He's on Instagram, and there's a permanent post about his DNA results"

JUSTNOMIL,fes1qd8,t1_ferdvzp,1579360549.0,"I practice. Sometimes just talking outloud, sometimes I get DH to take the part of the other person. Then I have experience in giving the snappy answers and I'm not as likely to get side tracked."
AmItheAsshole,fegoqsh,t1_fegg3s2,1579098926.0,That is a fact. It has nothing to do with how hard someone worked.  The people working at a steel mill in the 80s may have been able to buy a nice place for fewer hours worked.  But the 40+ hours they worked a week were damn hard.
facepalm,feeaqop,t1_fed7x5w,1579029898.0,"You're assuming whoever made the original post understands what ""reflecting"" is. I'm guessing that they think you have to heve a shiny metallic surface in order for light to reflect.  This is based on years working at a call center, always a good place to learn just how stupid people can be."
Chihuahua,fedu75z,t3_eoft62,1579019980.0,I will be happy to tell you all day how handsome yo are!
JUSTNOMIL,fdw2n3s,t3_en4iwc,1578754408.0,"Your JNMIL can suck rocks as far as I'm concerned. As an RN for over 30 years, the people who wipe asses are some of the most important people in health care. Most of my work has been in long term care, and at least in that setting, CNAs are worth their weight in gold. (Or even better, worth MY weight in gold. That would probably get you a lot more) Smart nurses know to listen to their aides and treat a good aide like the treasure they are.

 I think it's great that you're doing that in order to be a better doctor, and that you're going to be an awesome doctor. Don't let that waste of oxygen take up any more of your brain activity than she already has."
JUSTNOMIL,fdr1wdl,t1_fdqrqy0,1578678361.0,I am too! It's taken a lot of strength to get here.
weddingshaming,fdqz7oh,t1_fdooze2,1578677219.0,"Google Carnival style 213 bra. It looks exactly like what this woman's wearing. Including the wide elastic band at the bottom. So even if it is a bodysuit, it's a bodysuit that looks exactly like a long line bra. It is acceptable, even fashionable, to wear bras as tops, but it's still a bra."
aww,fde7w8w,t1_fde0le8,1578333118.0,Things not to do at work - read several Schnoodle poems in a row. Unless I want to explain to my coworkers why I'm crying.
Eyebleach,fcz9xj6,t1_fcyodzr,1578096642.0,"TIL about the Scottish Straight. But based on the pictures and description I saw, I think you're right."
Eyebleach,fcvera7,t1_fcuiy6y,1578000569.0,"It looks like a Persian, they are all fluff. Get one wet and they immediately look like a twig."
JUSTNOMIL,fc4215u,t3_eg2ony,1577404557.0,"You have my sympathy. As you said it seems like little things but when they happen all in one day and over and over again it, it is SO frustrating.
I'm a geriatric nurse and the first thing I ask families when patients are acting like this is to have the doctor check for a UTI or other infection. Seniors are notorious for having none of the symptoms of an infection except for being (more) confused. If there's no infection, there are other reasons for confusion including medications, dehydration or other medical conditions. And of course, dementia. 
Good luck with all of this!"
