starterpacks,ff8abxh,t3_es3h5y,1579670759.0,"I shared my nintendo switch with a 10 year old I didn’t know at a benefit. I’m 22 and we just played a couple rounds of mario kart. He was fine, quiet but a little pushy. I didn’t mind and as I was packing up to leave the kid brought me a cotton candy and told me thank you for letting him play.
His mom came up to me and told me he has Aspergers and never interacts with strangers like that. And no one is ever nice or patient with him. It really meant a lot to both of them. 
So that’s just a reminder to not get annoyed with kids because you never know what’s going on."
