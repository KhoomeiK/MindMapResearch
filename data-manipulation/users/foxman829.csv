politics,fgsj14o,t3_f09hlx,1581085579.0,"This is a good goal for teachers who have been teaching for x number of years, but this would not be feasible for brand new teachers. Also a lot of teachers make a lot more than $60k with a masters plus hours."
druggardening,fgfkow3,t3_exu3ut,1580741341.0,"Yes they are potent enough. I grew those and the Lauren's grape from the same company. Was high for several hours and threw up twice. I think it worked, although I hated it lol."
shroomers,fgc274s,t3_expy01,1580668296.0,"I used my instapot and had 12/12 jars inoculate just fine with no contam. Considering some people just use boiling water, an electric PC is better than that. 

The capacity is small though so I had to do the sterilization in batches."
druggardening,fg6l3o0,t1_fg6drns,1580570818.0,"Sweet, thanks! Unfortunately (maybe fortunately lol) I get really nauseous from opioids. I grew poppies last year and spent the night throwing up after trying my extracted opium."
druggardening,fg6b1gt,t1_fg5stzt,1580562086.0,Haha nice. I just moved down to Florida (9a) from Ohio so I'm stoked to grow some cool stuff.
druggardening,fg5knel,t1_fg5k3xf,1580530090.0,"Lol you should post a progress pic in a few weeks.  I think you could get some seeds from the bio live soil since it is made from composted green waste (did some reading on their website). 

What area of the world are you growing in?"
druggardening,fg5au86,t3_ewh6gn,1580522658.0,"The big seedling on the left looks a lot like a tomato seedling to me based on the trichome development, color of the stem, shape of the cotyledons and true leaves...

I could be wrong but I worked in a greenhouse and have grown a shit ton of tomatoes from seed. If you re-used your potting media it could be a 'volunteer'."

MTB,fg3uage,t1_fg3tkj7,1580489814.0,"Making ruts in the wet trail ruins the drainage ability of the trail. It's really not a bull shit rule at all. On trails that are maintained by volunteers, riding wet trails is a problem."
druggardening,fg1ca6w,t1_feyl2lm,1580424585.0,This is false information.
Frugal,ffvgtlm,t1_ffv9wmf,1580263785.0,"Most of the cheap meat in the US comes from factory farms with bad conditions. If I made more money (currently in grad school), I would buy meat from better-treated animals. I try to eat less meat or eat meat that I hunt, but I still regretfully buy some cheap meat. Beans destroy my intestines every time I try to eat them, so it's hard to replace my protein needs with beans. 

Farmers in the US are generally lower income unless they have a spouse who makes more or they have a second job. Most only get by because of the billions we spend on farmer subsidies each year."
Frugal,ffvfzpc,t1_ffv3r37,1580263234.0,"Wow that's cheap for the chicken quarters, I will have to look out for sales like that. Meat definitely is more expensive than plant options, and I try to eat less too. I get some cheap meat from hunting (if you don't include the equipment cost, lol). 

Your post was definitely inspiring - I'd be happy to become half as frugal."
Frugal,ffv3ae1,t3_ev82qh,1580254679.0,"How are you getting meat and vegetables for for $1 a pound or less? I shop at Aldi and the only fruit/vegetables that cheap are carrots, potatoes, onions, bananas, and maybe a bag of small unripe apples. I have never seen meat for $1 per pound there or anywhere. I also live in a low COL area."
Frugal,ffmehnt,t3_eu6eft,1580053368.0,"Go to an Indian grocery store before Diwali, they usually have huge sales. I got a whole pound of turmeric for $4 then. 2 pound of almonds for like $10."

Frugal,fffg1r1,t1_ffe98t4,1579883172.0,Definitely! It's a good thing OP thought outside of the box and had their car repaired instead of just buying a new one.
Frugal,ffe3bnm,t3_esuret,1579835603.0,Kind of strange to be posting about almost buying a brand new car on a sub about frugality. Frugal people don't shop for brand new cars.
greentext,ff3kjae,t1_ff1zghz,1579543001.0,Hell yeah can't wait.
greentext,ff1yd9a,t1_ff1kx2z,1579489015.0,"Just moved to Gainesville from Ohio and so far it's been a pretty good place. Way more trees and nature than I would have thought. It's nice wearing flip flops and shorts in mid January, although I've heard summer sucks. 

I haven't seen Florida man or any alligators yet."
ADHD,feo1h1a,t1_fenuynt,1579293833.0,It was extremely difficult and I definitely had no desire to read any of the other books after finishing the first. LOTR has been hard for me too.
ADHD,fen3758,t1_fel7fjj,1579275961.0,"Thanks for the tips! I think part of the problem is that I was made to read as a kid when I got in trouble and TV was taken away. Captain Underpants got me through the punishment, but I guess I didn't see reading as a voluntary, pleasurable activity. I'm a big fan of fantasy fiction so I will have to look for some easier books in this category. It took me over a year to get through A Game of Thrones, so I think I will try to find something a little more brief and concise."
ADHD,fekr5x1,t1_fek0k2p,1579205903.0,How do you get yourself to sit down and read a book? It's hard for me to read more than a few pages of a book at a time - and sometimes a single page.
ADHD,fec1fu5,t1_febr0o2,1578965253.0,"You might not have exams in your program, but many grad programs do involve exams. I just started grad school and all of my classes have exams, plus reading and writing. My s/o and friends who are in grad school also have exams for their classes."
aww,fe2j1em,t1_fdzxkb1,1578838922.0,There is legitimately too many of them. Here's an interesting [article](https://www.nature.com/news/rise-of-the-coyote-the-new-top-dog-1.10635) showing how much their population has spread across the US.
aww,fdznuot,t3_enalsa,1578792190.0,"That's cute and all, but you're  not going to be posting to r/aww when you let your fluff ball out to pee and it gets eaten. I'd have it trapped if I were you."
CasualConversation,fdp0l4p,t3_emclm6,1578617154.0,So you're one of the ass holes who applauds so loudly that the speaker has to wait to say the next person's name? Thanks for making commencement longer than it needs to be.
interestingasfuck,fc3y3sv,t3_efztls,1577401613.0,This is mildly interesting at best.
