MtF,fgkg7st,t3_eyxctu,1580864832.0,Don't push it. Be everything the TERFs say you aren't. That will win her over more than convincing her with words will.
excatholic,fgjc6mq,t1_fflinha,1580840982.0,This is why I hate Catholicism you're freaking out over someone else's narcissistic bullshit.

I'm learning different skills now because I need to transition into something else."
MtF,fggyicb,t3_eycktf,1580772438.0,yeah that's why dressing overtly fem can make you pass less because the masculine features poke out more now.
leagueoflegends,fgf3c5w,t1_fgerpl0,1580722140.0,Relentless hunter is such an op rune for mid lane too. Movement speed is so helpful for roaming.
mildlyinteresting,fgezpn0,t1_fgepfww,1580716818.0,That's either pedantic or trolling. Bathroom segregation is old but no one thought of chromosomes when public restrooms were made. An XY women isnt going to walk into the XY label when it's clearly another way of saying women just not as inclusive. Some might not even know.

MtF,fgeodb4,t3_exx3tp,1580704744.0,Antidepressants can cause hypomania. So I would be careful to diagnose you and not look at that first. I've personally experienced it as well while on hormones.
thedavidpakmanshow,fge7ihc,t1_fg5g7wb,1580693132.0,"Bro you have 100s of units of T in your body. Trans women post op and on hormones for several years is not going to have an advantage that's fact. Trans women actually have less T than cis women post op.

These douchebags who aren't on hormones for very long that are competing are jackasses."

thedavidpakmanshow,fge48sz,t1_fge2vu7,1580691017.0,"Lol I like your analytical take on it. I think part of the problem isn't your fault. Society still sees men as lesser if they don't prove themselves in the world but don't hold the same candle to women if they aren't successful. It's just isolating yourself from that and knowing your value as a human being is enough.

 Anyways thats all hypothetical but I think the strict gender role issue leans into less acceptance of LGBT people. We are failing men basically which creates environment where LGBT people suffer because then men lean into the strict gender role from how they were raised. Some liberals(left leaning folk) are part of this problem where they demonize men for being raised this way and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and also makes it worse. Kind of like how David always talks about how the left not letting people be better or change just isolates centrists from joining our side(but now I'm ranting).

Anyways theres some insight but I am just a rando on the internet. **I just don't want my people to be hurt.**"
thedavidpakmanshow,fge1xhm,t1_fge0lus,1580689658.0,yeah that's not really what I asked but sure that's optimal. Would you feel less of a man if you suddenly couldn't work?
thedavidpakmanshow,fge0v4a,t3_exgan6,1580689246.0,"Guns  - I've never seen a worse argument for banning guns other than shooting sprees are common. If you take away guns people will just use the black market and commit an atrocity either way. Or they will build bombs. I think parents should be responsible if their kid goes on a rampage with their gun. And obviously violent criminals shouldnt be allowed to carry guns. Mental health is the real issue, cultural stigma about mental health is the issue. Toxic masculinity is the issue.

Strong military - I dont think we need to have a strong military presence around the world that should really transition to a UN effort not America's burden. I want most military spending to go into R&D not recruiting more personnel to send overseas in random places across the globe. Having bases around the world clearly doesn't do shit for peace. The whole MAD idea is based on technology which we are falling behind in."
thedavidpakmanshow,fgdzx2k,t1_fg89aqd,1580688806.0,"That goes beyond LGBT acceptance it sounds like. Do you have problem with women becoming breadwinners?

transpassing,fgdoju3,t1_fgdm63i,1580684758.0,I disagree. 4 years HRT is different from 2 year HRT. The changes are just not as extreme.
todayilearned,fgd190s,t1_fgamlpd,1580678049.0,I don't know how you calculate that scientifically but I'm gonna be skeptical.
leagueoflegends,fgc0i3l,t3_expk30,1580667820.0,"So basically MOBAs are long drawn out games. When you do absolutely everything well that game but teammates keep making the same mistakes it makes you feel absolutely powerless. Like anything you do is pointless since the rest of the team will continue to make mistakes. And since these games are generally long it can feel like you cant just move on immediately. 


Powerlessness causes rage. Probably even moreso if they are powerless and lacking control irl. Them trolling/raging is kind of a way of taking the power back albeit in a non-helpful manner to anyone."
MtF,fgbv4gz,t3_exjy1u,1580666411.0,I think normal female T ranges can go up to like 70 ng/dL but they can go a bit higher in cis women naturally IIRC. Congrats!
Sense8,fg8jd2q,t1_fg8iuwu,1580621320.0,For sure
todayilearned,fg8gon0,t1_fg8g53q,1580618944.0,"I know what words mean. Its obvious you're ignorant enough to the point where you dont understand why someone would express emotion. Instead you insist people are babies because of your schizoid outlook. 

And I push back and say you can be emotional and be disciplined because I've done it most of my life. This goes back to my original argument of why toxic masculinity is pointless. Because you don't need to be a robot to be disciplined or whatever fantasy you have of what masculinity is. Lmao in fact it's why mens life expectancy is lower than womens because they dont deal with their shit and they dont go to the doctors.

 In addition plenty of feminine people are disciplined. So many feminine women put their head down and get things done."

MtF,fg7vycr,t1_fg78dz3,1580602846.0,"There really don't need to be ""signs"". Wanting to transition is considered a criteria for gender dysphoria.   


 \>In adolescents and adults gender dysphoria diagnosis involves a difference between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, and significant distress or problems functioning. It lasts at least six months and is shown by at least **two** of the following:

1. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics
2. A strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics
3. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender
4. **A strong desire to be of the other gender**
5. **A strong desire to be treated as the other gender**
6. A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender   


This is why transcum ideology is stupid. Simply wanting to transition and be treated as another gender is clinically defined as dysphoria."
Sense8,fg7bgh6,t3_ex0zmz,1580588490.0,"Me too. Season 1 was a masterpiece! Season 2 was great but I wish they focused more on day to day life within their own cities versus teaming up to fight the big bad.   


Everytime I listen to the soundtrack it brings back massive nostalgia."

MrRobot,fg4b03j,t1_fg2g68x,1580499922.0,I like season 2 over season 3 even though I have a hard time explaining why. Season 3 had lots of great moments but it felt slow to me personally. I didn't feel like we were going anywhere meaningful.

warcraft3,fg22jee,t1_fg0rliq,1580436923.0,It doesn't even make sense. Without creativity from map creators there's no maps to generate revenue off of? Is Blizzard just going to steal ideas? So confused.
warcraft3,fg22ecb,t1_fg1w4el,1580436863.0,Probably by Tencent. Ironically they might have a better influence than what blizzard is doing.
videos,fg0uknq,t1_ffzzwx7,1580415315.0,"It's interesting because getting offended about toxic masculinity is a result of toxic masculinity. They think their masculinity is being attacked but it's really the opposite since toxic masculinity tries to pigeonhole men into really narrow roles in society. AND toxic masculinity affects men more than women.

Fucking reddit."
MtF,fg0pbx3,t1_fg03i7z,1580412391.0,">I think you are grouping a large number of people here all with different views. Most ""truscum"" are a lot less extreme then you think.  

Maybe the older trans people who absolutely needed to pass in order get on hormones otherwise they are gatekeeped because society was less accepting than before.

>Also ""larping as trans"" so basically you are just saying that only the people who agree with you are actually trans. 

Nope now you're projecting. Psychology is easy. So truscum are alt lite manosphere conservatives who happen to have awful viewpoints to people who don't care about us? They are backstabbing pos. They can transition all they want but ""the lady doth protest too much"" in my opinion. Their viewpoints about non binary not being trans are really about them. Or at they very least are projecting their insecurities onto them.


>Also I don't see how being incel is in any way compatible with being trans. I've certainly never met someone like that.


It's probably hyperbole but again they are conservatives who are hyper focused on trans people being able to pass otherwise you should not transition or ""off yourself""."
MtF,fg0ohwc,t1_fg030c2,1580411929.0,"Nope part of their viewpoint has to do with passing and nonbinary people dont fit that according to them. Because society will only accept us if we try to be more ""normal"". Blaire White fits all of these criteria for example and shes conservative.

They literally have threads where they make fun of ""hons"" trans people who dont pass."
