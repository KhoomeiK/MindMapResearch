I regularly follow weight training with a few inversions because they are more solid thanks to all the muscles being fired up and ready. I only do a few and I’ve been turning upsidedown for years now so it seems to be working for me. If I ever notice my form starting to go, I come down ASAP just like with weights. Body awareness is critical for safety. 

Good luck getting back up there!"

And I know that the Yang Yang is a super cool, friendly place but can I just say that Joe and Bernie are just too fucking old? Bernie just had a heart attack and Joe has had so many “senior moments” that I’m worried for him. I want a president who is going to live to see the end of their second term and who is going to live here with the rest of us for another few decades."

As much as critical thinking skills and philosophy matter, we should also be offering financial literacy classes and implementing a universal basic income so that high schoolers will pay attention."
