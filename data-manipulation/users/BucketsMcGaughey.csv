Economics,ffiufvn,t1_ffit6nj,1579983001.0,"The point is it doesn't actually matter to the consumer, things still cost whatever they cost. So why not just be honest about that cost up front, instead of springing a surprise on people when the time comes to have over the cash? It's not just more convenient, it's more honest.

It's not costly to deal with. You charge x for whatever you're selling, you hand over 0.2x (or whatever the rate is, it varies by product as well as locality) to the tax collector when the time comes. Dead easy. If you're a small business, many countries are happy enough to offer you a simplified regime that just estimates what you probably owe them based on their experience with other businesses like yours, and you can choose whether to accept that or do the full calculation if you think it's worth your while.

I honestly can't think of any other country that does it like the US. It's just another one of those baffling things America inexplicably seems to think is better, like imperial measurements or going bankrupt from a broken leg."
Economics,ffirhdd,t1_ffip06y,1579980876.0,"Not really. It's a unified trade area with free movement of people and goods, and a single currency, much like the US. Taxes vary, wages vary, prices vary, things cost whatever they cost.

And yes, we have regional price variations within countries too, of course we do. Somehow we're able to cope with a bit of basic mathematics and life goes on."
politics,ffiqxap,t1_ffikwja,1579980485.0,"Actually breaking the law has nothing to do with it. It's a mechanism for removing an unfit president from office, simple as that. His enablers want you think he needs to have broken laws to be impeached, but it isn't true.

Besides which, these charges cover a fistful of actual statutory crimes. To say nothing of the innumerable others he commits on a daily basis. His entire life has been a relentless crime spree, and his time in office has been no different. Like, did you ever hear that leaked recording of him on the phone to Pam Bondi, where he managed to commit two different crimes in about as many minutes? Breaking the law is *effortless* to him. Staying the right side of it appears to be difficult verging on impossible."
Economics,ffhxl8n,t1_ffgjs9o,1579958308.0,"This argument just doesn't stand up. VAT rates vary across the EU, but every country shows prices inclusive of tax. We manage."
berlin,ff8ozbb,t1_ff5ug62,1579689669.0,"My take on this is that English people are kind individually, but cruel collectively. People are nice and polite and considerate, but society as a whole can be brutally harsh if you're poor or sick or just down on your luck.

German people, on the other hand, may sometimes be a little colder and less helpful, but that's in part because their kindness has been abstracted into the system, where it's usually more effective. And I think that's why individuals are less inclined to go out of their way for you - they're used to trusting the system and letting it take care of things. When you come from a country where these provisions aren't in place, and you rely on the people around you more, this can seem robotic.

 Like, the UK is full of kind teachers dipping into their own pockets to buy kids books and pens or even something to eat, and that's nice, but wouldn't it be better, and kinder, if the schools were funded properly in the first place? It's precisely this kindness that allows the monsters that run the country to get away with such cruelty.

Anyway, it's not lack of emotional intelligence that gets me here (people are people, everywhere), it's lack of basic situational awareness. There are six people behind you in the queue, it is not OK for you to take up five minutes of the server's time while you figure out your order in the bakery. And if you're then going to spend a further five minutes in a pedantic argument about the bill, maybe step aside and wait till the queue has died down a bit. It's not all about you."

I remember one morning we set off from the dry, pleasant, almost Mediterranean climate of Lalibela. From there we climbed onto a high plain where people dressed in heavy woollen cloaks and mostly kept sheep and goats. Then down, down, down into a valley, getting warmer and wetter all the time. Scrub turned into corn and wheat, then guavas and papayas. Suddenly there were camels everywhere.

After lunch, we climbed again, up a kind of escarpment and through some tunnels the Italians made during their short-lived attempt at an occupation. This area looked like nothing so much as the Alps, but when we came out of the tunnel on the back side of the mountain, it was *exactly* like Scotland. I'm talking heather, gorse, stone cottages with thatched roofs. Just a mind-blowing amount of variety to see in one day of travel. And if you gonna bit further, you'll find scorching deserts, snowy mountains, savannah, you name it. Just a stunning country."
