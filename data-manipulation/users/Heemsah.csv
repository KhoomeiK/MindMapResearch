nursing,ffimmjo,t1_ffhtqwf,1579977510.0,I would love to see a 288 in some of my people. Those 500+ ones get annoying after a while.
OldSchoolCool,ffibfeb,t3_etq0ry,1579969868.0,This is just the sweetest pic!!
TheCuddlePuddle,fffutof,t1_fffnqck,1579892275.0,Thank you!! You’ve been very helpful.

AskReddit,ffcmzjb,t3_esqst2,1579802896.0,"My mom asked my dad why he never told her that he loved her. He responded that he did tell her, ‘years ago’. He then added, ‘And that hasn’t changed. I’ll let you know if it does’. Problem solved."
nursing,ff6g4is,t1_ff6acyp,1579626459.0,Can’t use anti psychotics to make them sleep. Chemical restraint. Our facility doc yanks pain meds (and any psych meds) the second the res is admitted. It’s beyond frustrating.
nursing,ff3d9i0,t1_ff31x0a,1579538806.0,THANK YOU!!!
nursing,ff3d56i,t1_ff2xk2c,1579538747.0,And where do we get the extra staff? We have 2 nurses at nocs for 72 people. Supposed to have 4 aides but many nocs we only have 3. We don’t have the staff to be a sitter. That’s a luxury that corporate won’t even consider. It’s all about the money. Fuck the people who really try to make a difference.
nursing,ff3cpz4,t3_ercjxa,1579538534.0,"SNF are notoriously understaffed, esp at noc. We always end up with the most combative patients. We get a lot of dumps by Hosp because they don’t want them either. We can’t use restraints or even alarms to let us know if one is getting out of bed w/out assist, because ‘They have a right to fall’. And then, we can’t transfer them out because no one else wants them. It gets really old getting our asses kicked on the reg because we have no way of caring for these people. The Hosp has kept some of ours on Ativan drips to keep them knocked the fuck out because of the yelling and behaviors. And they can physically restrain them, too. Then they send them back to us after tx, and we get the shit show all over again. There are places for these people like state Hospitals. With staff trained to deal with them. We are not. They just admit any one because it’s a warm body and the census goes up."

AskReddit,fenp3gn,t1_fenjxsf,1579288801.0,"Yep. If I’m shopping, and happen to change my mind about something, I’ll take it clear back to the original place I grabbed it from. Drives my kids nuts. But it doesn’t take 5 min to put something back in it’s place. Common courtesy."
aww,fenmxhl,t1_femvqp6,1579288055.0,"A coworker and I have 4 kittens pretty much the same age. When they were little, we’d set up ‘play dates’ for them. It was such fun. 4 fluffy bundles ransacking the place every week or so"

calvinandhobbes,fduvelq,t1_fdtc1kw,1578739459.0,"If you write the word ‘MOM’ upside down, it looks like ‘WOW’. Calvin says that moms know everything, and that means that moms are ‘wow’. At least that’s my take on the title."

AskReddit,fdnm4pq,t1_fdk3gi1,1578588667.0,"We had the entire day shift show up hungover one morning, and even a few were still drunk. My coworker and I handed out Tyl like candy, signed off on report, and bounced. Wasn’t my circus once I handed over the keys. I was just impressed no one called in."
AskReddit,fdnlud0,t1_fdkr8z1,1578588497.0,"About 40 years ago (OMG I just realized how old this is!), a roommate handed me the ph, saying I had a ph call. It was like 5am, and I groggily said , ‘Hello?’. Some guy proceeded to tell me what he was gonna do to me when he saw me again, and so many other rather juicy plans, and then he told me that he loved me, and called me ‘Karen’ (or some other name).  I told him that he had some very nice ideas and I’d love to be the one but I thought he had the wrong number, and that my name wasn’t Karen. Dead silence for like a full minute. And then he profusely apologized. Over and over. I assured him I wasn’t offended and to be sure to find Karen. I hope he did, because those plans sounded fun!"
