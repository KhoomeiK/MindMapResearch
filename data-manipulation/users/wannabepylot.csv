solotravel,fclmehv,t3_ehstgw,1577751199.0,In the Dominican Republic between Punta Cana and santo Domingo. I had an outdated gps cause my phones didn’t work. I went through some city or maybe it was just a bad part of Santa Domingo. Idk exactly where I was I just know I shouldn’t have been there. It was bad. I was the only white person around (not to be racist) but that makes you stand out like a sore thumb as a tourist and I was in a super super poor area. I was in stopped traffic. 3 lanes were painted but it was 4 cars wide. I was completely boxed In. People were banging on the windows of the car asking for money. Spraying dirty water on the windshield and then cleaning it off and expecting I pay them like out of a movie. All these people were in rag clothes and one lady wheeled out her wheel chair in front of my car asking for food or money. I was very fucking nervous but eventually the traffic moved and I got out of there.
