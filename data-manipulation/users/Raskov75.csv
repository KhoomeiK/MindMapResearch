cataclysmdda,fdxt2q1,t3_enbxo5,1578772605.0,Crash landing scenario as a national guardsmen is a pretty solid start. You get a personal go bag. Activate it and get some passable early game kit. Better take the Tough trait because you start injured and there’s a chance you’ll also have a broken limb. ‘Tough’ adds hit points to all limbs so the worst you get is two fairly injured and bleeding limbs. No big cause there’s a med kit in the bag. First thing you’ll need to do is start running away from the crash site cause your former brothers in arms have turned and will bring your run to quick end if you don’t book it. Sometimes there’s loot in the rubble. Don’t be a sucker.
