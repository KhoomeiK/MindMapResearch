For real, though, day is going well, thank you. It’s Friday, got some shit figured out at work, life is good. Hope the same for you."

And to be clear, it also triggered me because there's a narrative being constructed in the United States of Iran being this big aggressor when it's much more complicated than that, and a non-zero amount of what they're doing is lashing out against the United State's own policies and actions (e.g. agreeing to and then withdrawing from the nuclear deal). So when you say that Iran is messing with the US military, it sounds a lot like that narrative. 

And also it sounds like the narrative the right wing likes to push in our country that the military budget is both untouchable and should be ever-expanding, while the rest of the government is a waste of money. It's this whole thing where the doublethink is kind of obvious but tribalism gets in the way."

Source: I was a government contractor who took part in the fleecing of US tax payers called “spending season” in the contracting industry. 

Your government (assuming you’re American), including the military, is basically a giant corporate welfare machine. The government paid $115/hour for my services, and I made about 1/3 of that. Guess where the difference went. Why did the government not hire me directly, or at least pay me directly and just give my company (really a glorified middleman) a finder’s fee or something? It’s set up this way on purpose.

So yeah, fucking with the military’s budget is something we can and should do. But it should be government-wide. Use it or lose it spending ensures they’re always operating at max budget, so they’re incentivized to waste rather than save. There’s no dept savings, so if your budget goes down and something important breaks, you would be fucked.

It’s fucking rigged, dude, until we fix that. We could do more shit with less money, by changing the calculus somehow."
