nosurf,ffrk4yi,t3_eus2h8,1580159675.0,I like the operant conditioning comparison.
offmychest,ff78us8,t3_es0fnh,1579643413.0,I hate it when someone describes themselves as an artist. We all drew pictures of our mommas as a kid.
solotravel,fdq7j91,t3_emm63n,1578658172.0,"I hope you can talk to someone close who know's you well to help you re-frame what you experienced. You've also gotta understand that being able to travel around the world solo is a relatively new concept, and no one knows how best to do it (what are the rules?) Should we just expect mugging to happen as a given? It might be sensible to expect it as default, the world isn't a pretty place sometimes.  


But as we know, rules are different for different people. I'm assuming you're a girl, and that comes with having a smaller frame and being more of a target for desperate locals who see you as an easy lick. It's hard to relate as a tall (relatively) muscular guy."

I can't tell if you're someone who used to enjoy Adam Sandler movies and now prefers Pulp Fiction,

Or someone who used to enjoy Pulp Fiction and now enjoys Citizen Kane.

In either case, taste grows, don't be ashamed of it. Be proud of it and maybe make film a hobby."

offmychest,fanhkiv,t3_e9wcwe,1576240624.0,"sounds like you have no evidence she's falling for you, 

it's probably just extreme gratitude. 

dude you've done more than 99.999% of the population would do. you know that right?

you can walk away no matter what with a smile because you're a good person. 

I've had situations similar to yours with someone who used to be my best friend and he fell into the street  life. After 5 tries I had to walk away.  But I don't feel bad because I tried. After the third time I realized  they're never gonna change, just leach off the person who tries to bring them up. Maybe she's different, but  the odds are stacked against that. If she's in a weak position in life she'll think of you as a saviour, someone who's gonna make everything ok again. like a father figure. when you leave she might just hate herself again.   


But once again. You tried. Good for  you and her even if she doesn't get it."
