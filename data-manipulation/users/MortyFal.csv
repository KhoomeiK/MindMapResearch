EarthPorn,fexxtt2,t1_fexpxub,1579438074.0,It really is a stunning place. When walking to take this photo I got to stroke some wild (albeit very tame) ponies as well :D https://imgur.com/a/CLKj7ix/
aww,fcmq6en,t1_fcmogs0,1577786748.0,"While I can’t really comment on that line specifically, overall TfW have been performing much better than ATW. In ATW’s last year they received 224 complaints per 100,000 journeys, compared to TfW receiving  150 complaints per 100,000 journeys in their first year. In terms of reliability (percentage of the trains significantly late (+30minutes) or  cancelled), ATW averaged 3.2% whereas TfW have averaged 2.5%. Not only this but TfW have actively invested in refurbishing current trains and leasing new trains while, starting from January, decreasing fares by a considerable amount and offering travel for free for a wider range of people. 

I should hope TfW have plans to improve their service to mid Wales like they have to the rest of Wales but I guess only time will tell."
aww,fcmoak3,t1_fcmngej,1577784073.0,"Same :p 

It is interesting the way the different companies under Arriva DB’s ownership are operated. And I still don’t understand how their bus website can be so poor. It’s like it hasn’t been updated since 2005. Can’t even find out single fare prices."
aww,fcmnqk7,t1_fcmnf4d,1577783296.0,"Rail passengers in the UK are a different breed honestly. Once had a seat reservation on a train (not at a table seat) and my seat was taken up by a lady’s luggage. She was taking up 4 seats just with her luggage when there was an empty luggage rack less than 2m away. This was my favourite seat though so I managed to build up the courage to ask her to move her stuff and she just huffed at me, and moved it to the two seats in front of her."
aww,fcmn7bv,t1_fcmkjot,1577782557.0,Arriva were a bit of a shit show but if this is a recent photo they’d be travelling on TfW who are doing a much better job at running train services.
aww,fcmmwz2,t1_fcmkzj8,1577782162.0,Can confirm that this is not allowed although I see it quite a lot. That train looks like a Transport for Wales train so the rules here are that it should be on a leash and not occupying a seat otherwise the owner can be fined. It’s worth noting however that it’s alright if the dog is in a small basket.
