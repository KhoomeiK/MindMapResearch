Supporting the USSR throughout his reign is supporting Stalin. They were virtually one and the same for a twenty year period. You can't pick and choose what you like when its convenient, especially because the few ""human rights"" the Soviets granted were largely rolled back by him. The fact that a tyrant like him was able to maintain power for so long is evidence enough of the failure of the entire Soviet experiment.

And its fine if you're delusional that everyone everywhere considers the end of the space race to be the moon, hence the finish line being there. You're a tankie so you have to make up victories for the Soviets when you can, I get it. But please I'm more than willingly to hear where you get the idea that the space race ended at getting into the atmosphere. For someone who seems so sure you must have some examples.

And I also get you have no real arguments so you have to keep claiming that I'm wrong without actually making argument as to why. Like how you literally haven't addressed a single point this entire time except to just say ""nu uh"".

> I see. I support the massive human rights improvements, so therefore I like Stalin. This isn't even a conversation. You're just assuming I'm an idiot and talking at me.

No I know you're an idiot, because you're saying the man who killing **AT THE LEAST** of his own citizens, killed, imprisoned, tortured, and killed political rivals and potential opponents, made a pact with fucking Adolf Hitler himself, and caused a genocide in the Ukraine, as well as fucking up most of eastern Europe for decades, even after his death.

What you think East Berliners were risking their lives trying to cross over to West Berlin for no reason? You think the Polish or the Ukrainians were happy under Soviet rule?

> The USSR won the space race,

The end of the space race was the moon. That was always the goal. Getting to the halfway or third of the way mark isn't winning a race. Especially if the people who got to the end first didn't bankrupt themselves trying to do so.

> fed it's people better than competing nations,

According to one study which you didn't even read, from 1984, which says they were fed almost exactly the same the USSR but the USSR had a better balanced diet. Thirty fucking years after your hero Stalin had died and gone to hell. Once again, you never even cited the source and clearly don't actually know anything about it besides your little tankie buds passing it around because its the only source of its kind that agrees with you.

But hey, I have a much more biased source towards you who can tell you all about the food situation in the USSR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8LtQhIQ2AE

>and massively improved human rights. 

Genocide, reigns of terror, mass starvation, jailing of political dissidents, gays being oppressed(something which became a thing again under your hero Stalin), secret police, taking over countries, working with the fucking Nazis. Just because they let women die equally with the men doesn't make them pioneers of anything. You don't get an award for being slightly less of a piece of shit than the last guy. Which he wasn't even.

>You've failed to argue otherwise aside from bad-faith nonsense about the CIA's veracity.

So if I find sources from the CIA about how many Stalin killed or how terrible the Soviet Union was you'd trust those to? You trust them when they say they didn't have anything to do with those coups in South America? You'd trust a source which contradicted that report from the CIA?"
HistoryMemes,ff8ms6l,t1_ff8m9sk,1579686334.0,"I didn’t give anyone a pass on anything.

But I’m dealing with someone who thinks the USSR won the space race and who is gonna cite that single CIA study from the 80s, which is the only document you guys seem to be able to find which says this find you, which concluded that the Soviet citizens had a better diet. As in, the had more nutrition. In the 80s. 

Also it’s funny how you tankies suddenly trust the CIA for that one study. I’m sure you trust every other source from the CIA right?

And who thinks dragging the carcass of a country over the corpses of millions to be up to par with the modern era is an achievement? Mao did it too. I’m sure those millions lost a long the way we’re grateful. The USSR collapsed upon itself while it attempted to remain being a superpower.

But once again, I’m dealing with an idiot who thinks the USSR was a success. I guess if you were a leader in the upper echelons it worked out fine. Until it all fell apart after a few decades and had to resort to the evils of capitalism to survive.

But hey I’m sure comrade Stalin would have loved to have a useful idiot like you helping him out. You guys love to call other people bootlickers, when you’re busying gobbling down the shoes of a mass murderer."

Its easy to imagine both dramatic and comedic scenes involving choking that would piss people off. Its all about context.

If its done poorly dramatically people could get upset yes, but its unlikely people are gonna actually get outraged, especially when its going to be portrayed as a bad thing. It being played for laughs tends to make people think its trivializes it.

Same thing goes for portraying a rape. People might get upset at a poorly done dramatic rape scene but they'll definitely get upset if a rape is played for laughs.

> and lets refocus on bojack trying to fuck that underage doe. Unlike the choking scene, he suffered no consequences from it. Maybe he will, but at the time it sort of went away, and was just a thing he did. If the PC police were as bad as people say they would have been all over that.
