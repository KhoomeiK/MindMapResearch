hackintosh,ffejgc0,t3_et5xz0,1579850518.0,Guilty. How do you update clover and the kexts safely?
hackintosh,ffbzer7,t1_ffbwxqm,1579787536.0,Yeah not going to. I’m happy that the hackintosh is running flawlessly.
hackintosh,ffbuln4,t1_ffbto23,1579783287.0,I don’t think the keyboard is the culprit. I did plug-in a usb-keyboard to try entering BIOS to no avail.

Gladly I figured out you can **hit F11 in the clover boot loader to reset NVRAM**. 

Unfortunately I still get a black screen when trying to enter BIOS. 

Any other ideas?"

If so, at what stage of the startup of your hackintosh did you press these keys? I tried pressing them on my Apple Bluetooth keyboard at startup but they didn’t register. Probably need to plug-in a keyboard through usb?"

Python,ff9x6vg,t1_ff9myqx,1579723454.0,I get the logic thank you. Is there an easy way to turn a table into a list or array?
Python,ff96kii,t1_ff91bmg,1579706038.0,That sounds like it could work. Some entries have the exact same values in all columns though. This is really messing with me. There has to be a solution that is not overkill.

Perfectly describes NDad. 

And EMom always tries to make me feel guilty when I refuse to take his shit anymore. Every time I truly stand up for myself after I was emotionally attacked and gaslit, she makes sure to tell me how mean I am for not forgiving him. 

His apology regarding the decades of abuse was to say:”Sorry for everything” with a smirk on his face. And when I ask him what he means by everything he says:”Well everything, it’s been such a long time, I can’t remember to be honest.”
