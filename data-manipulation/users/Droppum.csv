spirituality,fgvtsr0,t3_f0nkqs,1581152933.0,"It is also important that your spiritual journey is private. Your spiritual journey, if you are genuine about it, should be something just for you. 

By spiritual, are we talking Zen, Dao and that kind of thing? Or are we talking dream catchers, essential oils and tarot cards? Because sometimes things we call spiritual are far from spiritual"
confessions,fgvsr13,t1_fgvs30a,1581152611.0,"Seriously, some men will find it cute, or at the very least have empathy and be able to look past it. He is the asshole here. I would bet anything that when people ask him why you two broke up, he will leave out then stutter. He will know the that is a cuntish thing to do."
confessions,fgvsfv4,t1_fgve09p,1581152463.0,"Yeah, I have a friend Danny who would stutter as a child. He learned his way out of it. Also, many people don't realise that the later great Author, journalist and political commentator Christopher Hitchens had a bad stutter as a child. A really bad one. He would go on to become one of the most celebrated Orators of all time."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fgu8i08,t3_f0evjf,1581114901.0,"They should make a super hero movie where instead of fighting super villains, catching meteors and thwarting terror attacks, the hero goes and finds these pieces of shit and just tortures them to death over a few days."

facepalm,fgsy54v,t3_f04vtc,1581095077.0,"I suffer from Asthma and rarely need my inhaler. When I do however, it needs to be on hand because things can deteriorate fast. Asthma is an autoimmune problem which is why it is usually accompanied by other symptoms like eczema. Anyone who has ever had an allergic reaction knows that it is sudden and abrupt. Imagine that but it closes your airway. 

Why are supposed professionals in education so fucking dumb?"
JoeRogan,fgsw6ap,t3_f097ij,1581093911.0,"This kind of delusion runs deep in men. I sometimes fantasise about fighting a Lion and delude myself that if I can get on its back and choke it, I would have a chance. 

Btw, Victorians use to hold beast Vs beast events and bears win every time. I heard about this on a UK TV show called QI and there was one where they put a Bear against a Tiger and the bear just crushes the skull. Look it up, it's actually morbidly interesting."
insanepeoplefacebook,fgstb11,t3_f08o9a,1581092212.0,"This is definitely some Karen shit. Look, you don't get to decide your own name. Your parents do, and then everyone else gets to call you whatever they want. Names are naturally shortened. My name is Ricky, I became Rick. One syllable and one letter shorter. 

We in the West need to shake this idea that we get to decide out identity. We are what we are. A rose, by any other name would smell as sweet. Our identity is what other people see. They categorise us collectively and decide our identity in some unspoken agreement. 

What we don't get to do, is independently decide on someone else's  identity outside of that collective agreement. 

The kinds of people who try to do this and think that that is how the world works will always be deeply unhappy and riddled with anxiety."
MadeMeSmile,fgs5zfl,t1_fgs3zqc,1581073260.0,"It's because he works hard & networks well. There are plenty of people who make it based on just that. Those people are everywhere. Just as there are insanely talented people who are unknown because, while talented, they are not good at the extra stuff."
MadeMeSmile,fgs2cdi,t3_f01c47,1581067963.0,"At the risk of my Karma, Weird Al is shit. His songs are not clever and anyone can do them. Pick a song and change the lyrics to what it vaguely sounds like. Not hard. Not clever."
nextfuckinglevel,fgs1v7c,t3_f04k37,1581067269.0,That was his brother. He would have dived straight into the core of hell to get him.
TrueOffMyChest,fgs1rok,t3_f019wq,1581067126.0,"Women don't realise that any interaction with the penis will make it hard, even if you're not in the mood. This is why men get erections on buses from the vibrations. One disturbing Quora question I saw came from a woman who was concerned after her husband got an erection after their young daughter was playing on his lap. Very awkward and weird situation but it happens. It isn't because he is a paedophile. 

The older you get, the less this happens btw but for a young guy in his early 20s? Sure"
confession,fgs1cpf,t1_fgrkg4b,1581066521.0,Yeah this really isn't a big deal. You invited a friend over for a smoke. Informed him of the best way to get home. I guess it's a long walk home for Larry
