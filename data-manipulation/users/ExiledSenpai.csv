bostonboardgames,fgb8qz2,t3_exat5w,1580659604.0,"I would generally be interested in meeting for board games at Knight Moves. However, I'm not familiar with any of those games aside from Coup (which I'm not a huge fan of) and I don't like 2 player gaming.  


May I suggest you go to Knight Moves and find people to play with? You can often find people trying to figure out what game to play. If you ask those people if they need help figuring out what game to play, and then teach them that game, they'll usually let you play with them."
QuotesPorn,fgb7ljx,t1_ffyoebo,1580659320.0,Would you care to elaborate? I don't feel like you're really adding anything to the conversation unless you explain your opinion.

bernie2020,fg8qzvt,t3_exghnf,1580628308.0,"No, he met the donor benchmark, but not the polling benchmark. The debates were capped at 20 people, and he has the lowest polling numbers of everyone else who made the donor benchmark."
Wellthatsucks,fg3aft5,t3_ewiih9,1580476128.0,"Nail guns have redundant safety features. For one to go off you would need 3 things:

-The safety would need to be off

-The tip would need to be pressing up against something

-The trigger would need to be depressed

How the fuck did you manage to nail your finger?"

No, I'm embarrassed to be associated with people so angry that they sabatoge their own cause simply because yelling makes them feel better about the situation and/or themselves.

TheMonkeysPaw,fey6y9a,t3_eqog8n,1579441551.0,"Granted, but you no longer have those valuable experiences of having wasted money. Now, as an adult, with no fiscal experience or self control, you waste money on far more expensive things. You go in to debt and it ruins your life. It takes you decades to recover."
SandersForPresident,fey3ual,t3_eqs6to,1579440464.0,"I'm a staunch Bernie supporter. However, lets not win by lying or misleading people. In this video, Joe Biden isn't talking about cutting funding for medicare and medicaid. He is talking about FREEZING spending. Not just for those programs, but for all programs. That is to say, he's talking about freezing government spending. 

What does freezing mean? I took it to mean no more funding increases."
