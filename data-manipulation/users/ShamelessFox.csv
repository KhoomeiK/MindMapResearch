You haven't gotten ugly, you've gotten older and your face is maturing. You look more like a man and less like a boy. Sadly, people don't smile at men as frequently as women or children. I'm female, and I'm much more likely to smile and be friendly to a boy than a man who might misread those signals as flirting rather than just being nice.

Your not ugly at all and I suspect you're going to continue to mature, and hopefully your confidence will grow as well, into a very handsome man. Just don't let that shit go to your head once you realize you're a catch."

As painful as the loss is, it's a bargain for the reward of their love.

Now excuse me, I have to go hug my pup. He's (at least) 14 and this year alone has outlived 3 of my friend's dogs. All of those dogs my friends had adopted after I adopted him. I'm so very lucky. I adopted him 3 years after my childhood dog passed away. I know I'd eventually adopt another dog, but I understood why some people lose a dog and never have another. It's been 16 years since I lost her and I still get a lump in my throat when I meet a dalmatian in person. But my [mon petite](https://imgur.com/xqZq6zA.jpg) healed my heart when I thought I might not ever love again."

I don't have a visible disability. I look like a normal woman in her 30s. If I'm wearing shorts or a skirt you can see my patch work quilt of scars. I'm fortunate that I don't *look* disabled even if I'm carrying my cane."

My final 4 surgeries are a result of unexpected complications of having more metal in my leg than you'd find in a Nissan Sentra. My hardware had to come out and be replaced with much smaller metal, which itself then needs to come out before i can finally get my ACL replaced.

My older siblings I don't consider to be good people. At least 2 of 3 would only be interested to get money.  That's all they wanted when my father was alive. They only would want to know Dad had heart disease and was borderline diabetic. He also listened to ""The Pussycat dolls"" and ""Flogging Molly"""

LifeProTips,femhq35,t1_femh5q6,1579256147.0,"At the time I was just under the minimum weight for my insurance to cover it. I would have had to gain another 30lbs and maintain it for a year BEFORE jumping through all sorts of medical hoops (dietician, medically supervised diet, psycho analysis, seminars, yadda yadda); in order to get the procedure. I probably would have spent that much it of pocket in copays alone.

After my surgery I watched two other coworkers go through the process. They both were heavy enough to qualify well before they looked into it. Years into being that heavy (and several years after my surgery) they finally looked into it, then went through all the rigamarole, and finally had bariatric surgery.

Paying out of pocket was worth not wasting an additional 2-4 years of my life being miserable.

And funny thing? I spent so much time online researching doctors, surgeries, and talking with other bariatric patients online before my surgery, that after my first friend had her surgery she experienced a common side effect (she ate too fast, got ""stopped up"", and had ""foamies"") and texted me for advice. She had no idea what to do despite all of the ""educational"" seminars she was forced to attend.
