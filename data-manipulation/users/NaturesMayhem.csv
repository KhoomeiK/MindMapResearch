""Because we're talking about Weightlifting"", the fuck kind of explanation is that to why this has nothing to do with building muscle or losing fat. Because I was almost certain that weightlifting was very much so about building muscle and losing fat. You should go to the gym and tell all those guys pushing those heavy weights that it was never about building muscle and they should all be lifting styrofoam, to truly engage the sport. 

""The sport of snatch and clean&jerk."", pretty sure there's a lot more to weightlifting than just that. Otherwise you need to go tell all those people in the gyms doing some military presses that there's not enough ""snatch"" in their routine and thus not doing weightlifting.

wholesomememes,fd7kbgi,t1_fd686q9,1578205831.0,"I work at a Kroger and work with cart pushers, as well as pushed carts myself. It's difficult work, but not in a heavy sense. Cart pushing is more of a issue of how well you handle constant exhaustion rather than heart pumping strenuous work that's going to tear your muscle fibers. At least at my store, cart pushers are outside for several hours at a time. This is exhausting and difficult because the constant burning of energy that you'll achieve pushing moderately heavy weight at a decent pace will quickly drain you. And there is very little muscle will do for you if you don't have the energy to fuel it. So what these people face are a depletion of energy stores that drags them into exhaustion and they have to constantly work through this to keep pushing in carts.

Cart pushing at a moderately popular store, that treats their employees like shit by not giving them adequate breaks or work loads, and doesn't provide tools to help push in the carts, will result in difficult work. Their job is not easy. 

Despite all of that, it's unlikely anybody gains a 6 pack from pushing carts all day long. You'll lose weight and gain better endurance, but that should be about it.

However, how can one expect something for merely being related to someone who is serving? She’s not even the one doing the work."
educationalgifs,fcwj0mu,t3_ej4pcs,1578026927.0,"Also helps to not deny or push away monkey mind. Telling monkey mind that he is wrong or shouldn't be the way he is will just result in him being more intrusive and noisy. What's needed is acceptance and direction. 

Really though, meditate however the fuck you want, it's not a concept set in stone. Do whatever you enjoy."
gaming,fcv18w4,t1_fcutzm0,1577992560.0,"Just recently started working and it's a struggle. Going from being able to play all the game I want. To having to pick out which games I want to play, because I don't have the time to devote my attention to all of them. I have a steam library full of games that I would love to play, but I'm too hesitant to devote time to them because I'm still playing other games."
hentaimemes,fctkije,t1_fcswrml,1577946575.0,"I really don't understand what all those people expect laying compliments upon those women. At best it's cause they're genuinely uplifting people who like to compliment others. More likely, they're guys so starved for attention and affection that they roam the internet complimenting every nude girl they see in hopes of being noticed. Which is sad."

Iamactuallyverybadass,fcmfbih,t1_fcm01wj,1577773156.0,"Oh no, those people are still certainly at fault. They pull the trigger, they decide to steal, they decide to throw the fist, etc. The issue is that this is not representative of a racial trait as many people try to claim. This is the result of a situation they've been placed into due to the actions of white people actively trying to keep black people from prospering. Resulting in racial inequality that then resulted in poverty, poverty and a lack of education then results in a higher crime rate. 

They're still responsible for the actions the take, the crimes they commit. However, that's personal choice, it's not a defining trait of the African American race and people should not use crime statistics to try and claim such."
Iamactuallyverybadass,fcliflv,t1_fcl1tnh,1577748533.0,"Yeah I hate when people bring up black crime rates as if that proves racial aggression or some shit.

However, spending too much time in your head, weed or no weed, is typically not for the best. You start to lose touch with reality and the joys of it and it can be depressing as everything in the real world seems to have little meaning."

ConvenientCop,fcjbkxz,t1_fcixy7o,1577682230.0,"Can someone explain to me the purpose of the left lane? I understand it's a ""passing"" lane, so it's useful for if people are going slower in the right lane and you want to get around them. But from my limited experience, people go the speed limit or a little over. So it hardly matter if someone is sitting in the passing lane, you shouldn't be passing somebody that's already doing the speed limit. To do so you would have to speed yourself. 

I would understand this issue a little more if people had a habit of going below the speed limit, but it seems the opposite of that, people can't stay under it. This is anecdotal of course and where I live may be very different from where other people live and what they experience."
BadMensAnatomy,fccgzs1,t1_fcb6rps,1577598280.0,It really astonishes me how many customers smell like actual shit. How many people think it's okay to go without taking a bath?
