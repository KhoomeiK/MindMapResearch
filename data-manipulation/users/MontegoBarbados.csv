blackmirror,ff9ot63,t3_es868o,1579717528.0,"I've experienced this far too many times. It happens when you recommend something that you absolutely love (movie, TV show, song,, etc.) and your enthusiasm for it gets someone 5% interested (""Hmm umm okay I'll check it out sometime."")

When they do check it out - *if you are present* \- this strange subconscious thing occurs. They're watching something for the first time with someone who clearly loves it, someone who hopes that they will love it too. Their interest dips, their attention wavers, and they don't fully enjoy it or get it.

While watching something they are 5% interested in, with a fan present, they feel like there's an *expectation put upon them*. They're unable to simply enjoy it on their own.

Self-discovery is a powerful thing, to stumble upon a movie/show/song with no or low expectations and then realize on your own how awesome it is. The opposite is when someone highly recommends something with the tone of ""You WILL love this like I do."" If there is a feeling that they are *supposed to love it*, they probably won't.

The best thing to do is to recommend Black Mirror (or another show/movie/etc) but make sure that they watch it on their own, or at least without you in the room. They can enjoy it without that feeling of expectation, without feeling your eyes on them."

RDR2 gave me what I wanted in RDR1. After Arthur’s death, John has an “endless summer” where he is free to roam the world while his family is at Beecher’s Hope. He will never die in this game. I also have a second saved game that I often load, where Arthur and the gang are at Clement’s Point and forever will be.

RDR3 may similarly give me what I wanted from the previous game. Perhaps the new game will be about the Callendar Brothers and how they came to join Dutch’s gang. The map will include and expand on the previous two. John and Arthur will be supporting characters. We know that both Callendar brothers die before the start of RDR2.
