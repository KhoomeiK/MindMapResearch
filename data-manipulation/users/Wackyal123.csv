startrek,ffhy57w,t1_ffhvq1t,1579958933.0,"Costs come down... dramatically. TNG was HD-afied 9 years ago. You’d be amazed at the cost reduction along with the speed these things can be done. Render times are a lot less, and software is available that would make any retexturing/fx/lighting substantially easier. Also, much vfx work is going to India now due to the cost and the numbers of workers over there, so more people can work on something like this at a fraction of the cost 9 years ago. 

Based on a) the re-merging of paramount and cbs at Viacom, along with b) the number of trek shows coming out shortly, I expect an HD DS9 by end of next year."

aliens,ffed4rr,t1_ffdrx93,1579843678.0,No.... I don’t think you quite understand. This WAS debunked by the very VFX artists who made it.
LabourUK,ffbvo17,t1_ffbt707,1579784307.0,I think you’re the one who should think before you speak. Abusing children is so not the same thing as not believing that a trans woman is a woman. What a disgusting position you’re taking.
LabourUK,ffbogj3,t1_ffbnr4v,1579775693.0,"People have different skin colours, and have different genitals, can be attracted to people of the same sex, and choose a different belief system. Those are hard facts which can be tested, and visibly seen. 

But it’s a lot harder convincing people that if a person with a penis, and continues to have male chromosomes, chooses to identify as a woman, they are a woman. It’s especially hard for many women who’ve grown up as girls and women, and gone through things that only women go through such as menstruation, the menopause, post natal depression, abuse etc. 

It’s a little like people who have religious experiences. If you rely on someone’s personal experience for proof, it’s not enough. For many, many people, they just don’t believe it, and see it as attention grabbing, or downright self delusion. 

I don’t think anyone sees the Labour Party as a straight white men’s club (although, it should be noted, that the Labour Party IS for labourers who, in large parts of the country, do fit that demographic). It’s why labour lost the election so dramatically. Because it panders to the woke culture of identity and doesn’t stand for solidarity of culture for Britain. Many many people, want to see Britain have a common culture again, rather than being a country of “individuals” who want to do what they want. 

Until labour find a balance, they will always lose. Which is sad, because I voted labour."
unpopularopinion,ffbk66r,t3_esmy5u,1579769185.0,"It only works if it isn’t corrupted and used to influence policy. The problem is that it is. Also, a true capitalist system doesn’t look after people who fall on hard times but rather punishes them for not doing well. Sadly, hard times are often out of ones control. 

Capitalism with socialist programmes such as healthcare, free education etc are the best systems, as you can see across Europe."
DeepSpaceNine,ffbk0dv,t3_esj3hd,1579768954.0,"Because it hasn’t been HD-afied. It wasn’t deemed cost efficient after the TNG HD versions did badly, but now streaming services pay for the shows, the franchise has made some money. 

My suspicion is that we’ll have an HD ds9 by the end of 2021... thanks to the popularity of the franchise now and with so many new treks en route, can only mean that they finally have some cash to spend. Also, the tech is cheaper and better to do an HD version and can be done quicker. Hopefully they don’t fuck it up with a simple upscale."
