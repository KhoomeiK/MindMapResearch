MechanicalKeyboards,ffi6rsh,t3_etp1rv,1579966580.0,"I'm looking for a 65% keyboard, because i want the small form factor but can't live without the arrow keys. I'm thinking of getting the Ducky One 2 SF, but the only drawback for me are the non standard key sizes and the layout on the bottom right. So the Durgod Hades 68 caught my eye because it has the perfect layout, but i'm not sure if i should get it. Ducky costs 120 euros, and Durgod 130 euros here, so it's not a big difference in price. Are there any other 65% keyboards i should look at at this price point?

My requirements are:

* removable cable
* rgb or just white backlighting
* gateron or mx brown switches
* no more than 130 euros"
MechanicalKeyboards,ffd5mco,t1_ffd16v4,1579813879.0,Oof its pretty expensive here. Minimum 150 euros

socialanxiety,ffanhza,t1_ffab3sd,1579740098.0,"Alright thats good, but i feel like 24h is too much. Youll have waaay too much time to overthink. I recommend just writing down what you plan to say, practice it a few times and go for it. But we are all different so i understand if you need more time. As i said before, all that matters is that you do it :). Just remember that no one judges you as much you think. Plus if you say something dumb theyll forget it very quickly"
socialanxiety,ff8ok1e,t3_erz7la,1579689038.0,"I used to be very anxious about making calls. But the more i did it the easier it became, to the point where i barely have any anxiety when making phone calls. You just have to force yourself to do it. The way i did it was just make a phone call as soon as i have to. The more its on your mind the more you overthink it. So if youre at home now, just make the call. I know its hard but i promise itll get easier. Do whatever you have to do. Write out exactly what you want to say and read it while in the call. All that matters is that you do it. Let me know how it goes!"

it makes perfect sense, i'm actually the same. at home i often can't stop talking lol. but in school i barely say anything. i feel like i would get along with a lot of people in my class if i could actually talk to anybody. and even if i force myself to say something that's not the real me. i sound like a completely different person. i feel like i come across as boring and completely uninterested in people, when it's the exact opposite"

socialanxiety,f01mb1d,t1_f009gjh,1568316321.0,"> What helped me is just genuinely stop caring about what other people think, I found it very important to not overthink things, just say what you need to say and if they point out something wrong with what you said, just laugh it off and just tell them you made a mistake. I stopped taking social interaction a loss less seriously and now I have a small group of friends that I'm close with and I can get along well with everyone else.  
>  
>For me, the most important thing was definitely not overthinking things. If I start thinking about it, I just cut my thoughts off right away and say what I was going to say. If it comes out wrong, I just laugh, apologise and try to clarify what I meant. Even if you get embarrassed or stutter or anything, it's important to realise that this is a natural reaction for making a mistake, the best thing to do is just laugh over it and move forward, past it.

it's hard for me to stop caring what people think. because i've been on the other side as well. for example when someone is rambling non stop about a topic no one cares about and doesn't give a fuck, it's annoying. no one's gonna tell him, of course, but that's how it is. i don't ramble though, just giving an example. i do have a problem with complaining a lot about my issues because i really have A LOT of them. but i'm going to a therapist soon so that will be fixed in no time. 

another thing is being afraid of coming across as an idiot. like for example when i don't know something that (i think) should be obvious, i'm always embarrassed to ask a question. i'm pretty sure i'm actually stupid so that makes it harder lol.

> I feel like I'm rambling now, so I'll stop here and hope you find this somewhat useful. Trust me, with a little effort you can improve! Just a few years ago I was terrified to even look people in the face or engage with strangers. If I can do it, I'm sure you can too! You rock, dude. Don't give it up yet! 

i'm sure i will be able to talk to people normally one day, but at my current state that is unimaginable to me. i won't give up, thanks for the encouragement!

> Edit: The people who are like ""nice convo"" are either being awkward themselves or just poking a bit of fun at you. I thought people saying this kind of thing meant they were out to get me and we're making fun of me, but if you can just laugh and go ""lmao I know right"" on Discord, it looks a lot better and sounds more confident. This is what I've figured out about myself after a couple of years, so hope it can help you too! 

sorry but i don't think that's true. one time might have been so. but another time the person was like ""well that was a nice convo, see ya"" so i bet she was annoyed, and not just poking fun at me. we would usually chat for like 1-2 hours, or even more, but that time it was done in 15 mins. btw these people know i have social anxiety and all that, and that i'm aware that i'm bad at conversations. also i don't want you to think i don't have a sense of humor. i laugh at myself all the time, but that just looks like they are annoyed and i can't help but be a tiny bit hurt. i hope i explained it well

> Edit2: You sound like a cool guy, if you want you can add me on Discord and we can talk or play games or anything! I know it sounds terrifying when I say this, but honestly the best way I found a bit of confidence and reassurance was just talking to people when there wasn't anyone around at that time, so if you can handle a decent conversation with one person, you can easily work your way up to be confident with small groups. And yeah, I've definitely rambled at this point haha. 

lol i don't know how you can see that i'm a cool guy, but thanks! it doesn't sound terrifying, i talk to people on discord all the time. but those are very different peeps from the ones i mentioned, and i'm mostly comfortable around them, and we have a lot of fun! pm me your discord tag and we can do that for sure.
