You are used to it so it feels like normal. Al-Anon will remind you that it is NOT normal.

And it will be a place not only of support, but also of practical advice. They will be able to give you advice on how to keep yourself and your family safe, who the good lawyers are if you need them, where shelters are, etc. 

Finally, they will be your friends, without shame. They get it, they have been there, and they want to give you the same kind of help and support. I’ve made lifelong friends in Al-Anon. 

Wishing you safety and healing."
