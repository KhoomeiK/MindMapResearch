Anxiety,ffk2jdo,t1_ffk2ehh,1580013823.0,"Yes all the time. When I was a kid I couldn’t sleep in the car because I had to watch out for a car accident, it’s if you let go of that fear it feels like you have no protection. There’s no relaxing because relaxing makes you even more anxious. Movies are a big anxiety trigger and concerts and I can’t usually enjoy it because I’m always looking around and worrying"
Anxiety,ffk27a9,t1_ffk1mk1,1580013534.0,So much worse. People try to comfort me with “what’re the odds?” And it doesn’t help at all because you could say that to anyone and random people are getting hurt like this
Anxiety,ffk1h18,t1_ffk1dbw,1580012911.0,I’m glad I’m not alone but it’s scary
depression,ffhip3a,t3_etnonr,1579937023.0,"You sound a lot how I was in high school. My advice for you is try to get ahead of it now because if I would have things might be different. I still feel scared for my future because I don’t have any motivation either, I had to leave college cause I couldn’t get out of bed. The best thing you can do is talk to your doctor when you get the chance. Most of my issues started in childhood and I feel jealous of my brother because he was younger when my parents were so bad but I love him to death. Understanding what happened as a child helps a lot. It’s hard to let go of resentment but therapy has helped me with that. I know how it feels to get those thoughts and scenarios stuck in your head and it’s hell, you’re not alone with that but there is help for it. So please tell a professional or someone who can help. I know it’s hard, I never wanted to but when I did it was a big weight lifter off. It feels very vulnerable but that can be good sometimes. Best of luck my friend"

AskReddit,ff7n2kv,t3_es401n,1579653481.0,Not so well. I don’t have anyone to give me a reason to leave the house. All I do is lay on the couch and watch tv and I can’t bring myself to do anything else. So not so well

socialanxiety,ff6g09e,t1_ff6fj1n,1579626386.0,It might just be I’m not around as many people anymore. I went to my college therapist and I didn’t like it. But I was feeling super down after I left and after a few years I went to therapy and it was really helpful. I’m still struggling a lot but at least I have someone who isn’t biased  to help me through it
socialanxiety,ff6bpol,t1_ff6ajcb,1579623697.0,"Not at the time, I started Zoloft when I was in high school when my social anxiety was really bad and it really helped. I started going to therapy about a year ago and it went down even more so I switched to a different med to help with my depression rather than anxiety because I learned some skills and the meds still kinda help"

Anxiety,ff2aobi,t3_er8tso,1579498879.0,I steer away from stuff like that because I have really bad anxiety about anything “scary.” I am very interested in criminal mysteries and other stuff like that but I realized I can’t handle it
depression,ff29p4s,t3_er8g22,1579497967.0,My therapist tells me to write a journal entry everyday at some point. I haven’t been doing it because I feel the same way but I’m gonna try tonight.

5sos,feehsq4,t3_eop27w,1579034025.0,When I went they collected our phones. We got there around 7am and there was a long line for it. They played some songs and people asked questions and then we took a brief picture with them and left.
