AmItheAsshole,ffc61vb,t1_ffc4il0,1579792370.0,Lol tel that to the 40 something year old men literally yelling at each other in a meeting I was in because one guy kept asking the same question thats already been answered and him not accepting the answer and hoping to get a different answer if he asked enough times. It was so uncomfortable.
AmItheAsshole,ffc4th4,t1_ffa6pz8,1579791541.0,"Right? People write off their own family members so quickly without a second thought because they said something mean to them. Get out of here with that shit. My older sister made fun of me all the time, but when it came down to it shed also protect me and beat the hell out of someone for me. I would never write her off. She was my best friend growing up and at certain times my only friend. Shes always been there. Im not going to toss that away because she said some mean shit when we were little and insecure with the dumbest brains we will ever have. And it never stopped us from doing nice things for each other. I dont get this sub anymore. I thought being an asshole was whether or not other people got hurt, physically, emotionally, financially, that didnt actually deserve it. But here its all about an eye for an eye and vindictive petty revenge. Its crazy."
AmItheAsshole,ffc3zus,t1_ffaf5s1,1579790977.0,Im the youngest and I know I was a dick to my sister. She was also a dick to me. But that didnt stop either of us from doing nice things for one another.
Genealogy,ffc39hl,t1_ffabo9w,1579790458.0,"I dont know. I consider all Puerto Ricans dead and alive my people. Whether or not were related. Its just something thats always been a thing. When another PR finds out I am as well they get really excited, especially in Texas where its pretty rare. Its a pride and kinship thing. Do you ever notice that its mainly the Puerto Rican flag people hang on their car mirrors? Or the fact theres even a Puerto Rican parade? Theres only about 3 million people on the island, and another 3 million in the states. Thats really not a lot of people. Their culture is slowing fading away, so a lot of them do everything they can to keep it alive. I do it by telling the history of how Puerto Rico came to be. 

Another reason why I feel more of a connection with my Puerto Rican side is because they accept me. Theyre happy that Im one of them. My white side, not so much because I dont look like them. I look racially ambiguous but its only been other Puerto Ricans who can tell Im one as well. Being Puerto Rican is part of my identity, its not all of my identity. Im an army brat and moved around a lot so knowing where I come from is important to me because I dont have a hometown. Having that connection with a group of people that we share an ancestral history is nice. I dont know what else to tell you."
Genealogy,ffa6w0x,t3_esfhlr,1579729044.0,"On my dads side is pretty much traced back to colonial America, Ive got ancestors that were on the Mayflower, and others that lived in Jamestown at some point. But what Im really interested in are the ones that came here from England and Scotland, and what their lives were like before the immigrated. But its pretty basic and theres not too much that millions of people dont already share. 

On my moms side is Puerto Rican, and I cant get very far at all on her side. I just know that were Spanish, African, and Taino. I learned about the Taino culture and I fee a connection to it, same with the West African slaves that were brought to Puerto Rico. The Spanish I dont really care about because in my mind they were the ones who raped my great grandmothers and tortured and murdered my people. Ive been trying to teach myself Spanish, mainly because I live in Texas and its useful, but to also have that connection. Ive never been to Puerto Rico, but plan on going once its a little more stabilized. Growing up I knew I was Puerto Rican and my mom was part of a Hispanic Heritage Club where I did traditional Puerto Rican dancing in parades and festivals. I dont see anything wrong with learning about where you came from and trying to keep it alive."

AmItheAsshole,ff9wz2r,t1_ff9vm54,1579723320.0,"Good for you? Im the youngest of 2 and had an older sister who I would borrow clothes from because her clothes were nicer. Shed be pissed, but eventually shed give me the clothes she didnt want anymore and told me that if I wanted to borrow something I could just ask. That went a long way for me and taught me not to be such a dick."
AmItheAsshole,ff9v6pd,t1_ff9ps56,1579722184.0,"For anyone who isnt a younger sibling sure, fair enough. But if the OP wants to have any kind of positive relationship with their sister they gotta set the example instead of stopping to their level. Theyre kind of stuck together until OP moves out on their own, might as well make it more bearable and have everyone be happy. Its not fair to write off a 13 year old little sister, that shit is going to stick with her. Shes still learning how to be a person and pushing everyones boundaries to see how far she can go. None of us were perfect angels at that age."
AmItheAsshole,ff9ukny,t1_ff9qzy6,1579721705.0,"Its a 13 year old kid whos your sibling. Siblings say mean shit to each other all the time. Theyre the older sibling and should be setting a good example instead of being reactive. Jesus. Have you never got in a fight with your sibling and then 5 minutes later act as if nothing happened? Youre not being a doormat if you make nice gestures. Youre being a considerate human being, and maybe that will rub off on the younger sibling and they in turn will be nicer."

AmItheAsshole,ff9hn87,t1_ff9flh7,1579713215.0,"It may not be their responsibility, but its a nice gesture to offer. Especially for a younger sibling. Just because something isnt your responsibility doesnt mean you shouldnt take initiative and do something nice."

AskMen,ff3o65p,t1_ff33gcw,1579545243.0,When I lived in Germany (dad was in the army) I was going to a show in another city Ive never been to. My boyfriend at the time was driving and I was the navigator with the MapQuest directions. I had the window down and when we got on the autobahn I reached over to roll the window up (manual crank) saying the directions are going to fly out the window and just as I did that the directions flew out the window. We were able to get to the city because we knew what direction it was in. And once we got there we drove around looking for people who were dressed like us and asked if they were going to the show and where the venue was. We made it to the show just in time. My boyfriend at the time wouldnt let me live down losing the MapQuest directions. But everything turned out ok.

Im the only female manager in my department, and its not too bad. The other managers joke around and tease each other and they dont treat me any differently. Still with respect and friendliness. If they behaved the way your coworkers do I would have put my foot down too and not let it continue. It sucks when youre the youngest person having to tell much older people to grow up."

AmItheAsshole,fekurif,t3_epo8qi,1579208017.0,"YTA Like others have said, if this was important to you and something you wanted to share with your GF then you should have been proactive and make the plans yourself. My boyfriend knows I like X-Men movies and when The Dark Phoenix came out I said hey, we should go watch this movie on Saturday and we did. I had zero expectation that he would do it on his own or even remember. Sometimes he surprises me.

Austin,fej8v97,t3_epberb,1579161933.0,"The bus system is ok here. But when I used to ride it I had a lot of encounters with guys that made me feel unsafe. I once had a homeless guy put his head on my lap, and another guy who knew my routine and knew where I worked and lived and offered me a sip of his 2 liter Big Red. Also there was a bus driver who didnt like that I filed a complaint about him because he would intentionally drive past me because I was on my phone and couldnt see him driving up so I didnt stand up and make direct eye contact with him...even though I rode the same bus every day at the same time. When he figured out it was me he threatened to throw me off the bus. So I had to start catching the one before that so I could make it to work on time."

Sometimes the executives and other managers from HQ will come down to visit, and people will typically dress a little better. But for the most part everyone dresses SUPER casual. It drives me crazy. Once our CPO came down to visit and one of the supervisors decided it was the best time to dye his long hair bright red, wear a long black trenchcoat, and super goth boots. I couldnt believe it. On the other end of it one of my team members wore a suit that wasnt tailored and a tie. It was over the top but at least he made an effort. What he wears normally would have been perfectly fine. A polo tucked into khakis with a belt. Everyone else just wore jeans and a hoodie/t-shirt, which is fine for our office, but I would have liked for them to dress a little nicer for an executive visit."

Ive talked to my boyfriend (the father) about it, as well as my friend who came with me for the 2 week checkup and the last minute surgical abortion, and was actually my roommate who took care of me when I was going through the abortion pill. My boyfriend would have been there, but he had to work and couldnt take time off. Were still together, were going to hit our 8 year anniversary in a couple of months.

AmItheAsshole,fds5oyo,t1_fds0675,1578694930.0,"It felt like my insides were trying to leave my body. The cramps were nothing like I ever felt in my entire life. I honestly thought I was going to bleed to death and die. Not even exaggerating. It wasnt in waves like contractions, it was at least 2 hours of a constant non stop contraction. The pain meds they gave me did nothing. I think the pain was so bad and it didnt take was because I was 10 weeks along. Ive never had a miscarriage, so I imagine it was similar. When I had the surgical abortion 2 weeks later the nurse fucked up the local anesthesia when the doctor was right at the point of removing the fetus, so I felt the whole thing, and that pain was nowhere near the pain from the chemical abortion. Im pretty sure they did all of this on purpose to punish me because I live in a red state and they were trying to ban abortions during this time.

When another PR finds out I am as well they get really excited, especially in Texas where it’s pretty rare. It’s a pride and kinship thing. Do you ever notice that it’s mainly the Puerto Rican flag people hang on their car mirrors? Or the fact there’s even a Puerto Rican parade? There’s only about 3 million people on the island, and another 3 million in the states. That’s really not a lot of people. Their culture is slowing fading away, so a lot of them do everything they can to keep it alive. I do it by telling the history of how Puerto Rico came to be. 

Another reason why I feel more of a connection with my Puerto Rican side is because they accept me. They’re happy that I’m one of them. My white side, not so much because I don’t look like them. I look racially ambiguous but it’s only been other Puerto Rican’s who can tell I’m one as well. Being Puerto Rican is part of my identity, it’s not all of my identity.

But it’s pretty basic and there’s not too much that millions of people don’t already share. 

On my mom’s side is Puerto Rican, and I can’t get very far at all on her side. I just know that we’re Spanish, African, and Taino. I learned about the Taino culture and I fee a connection to it, same with the West African slaves that were brought to Puerto Rico. The Spanish I don’t really care about because in my mind they were the ones who raped my great grandmothers and tortured and murdered my people. I’ve been trying to teach myself Spanish, mainly because I live in Texas and it’s useful, but to also have that connection. I’ve never been to Puerto Rico, but plan on going once it’s a little more stabilized.

At that point you might have a clearer idea of what you want. You’re not an asshole for being honest with her. And it’s ok that she’s upset, I’m sure she was looking forward to it. Put this on the back burner for a bit and do test runs, like have her stay with you over the weekend (make sure your roommates are cool with it). And if you’re still not sure and aren’t ready by the summer, thats perfectly ok, just continue to be open and honest with her."
AmItheAsshole,fdmf3s1,t1_fdmcexf,1578547813.0,"They said summer of 2020, so at that point 10 months to a year. Moving in with someone after a year of dating isn’t a big deal. But if they’re not ready they’re not ready."
AmItheAsshole,fdkei6k,t1_fdkajxe,1578502167.0,"I feel you on not having anyone nearby. I had my daughter in Germany. When my daughter was 2 months her dad deployed to Iraq for a year. Luckily my parents were stationed in Belgium and it was a 6 hour drive, so I would stay with them for a week or two. Other than that it was just me and her for weeks at a time. I’m pretty sure I went 2 weeks without talking to a human adult in real life. The whole experience just makes me not want to have any more kids. It’s been 12 years and I still feel bad about how awful my daughter’s birth was and how I was her only caretaker for the first year of her life. I couldn’t breastfeed because she never latched and I tried pumping but it just wasn’t working out. And I never got a break."
AmItheAsshole,fdkdkl6,t1_fdjn5vj,1578501609.0,I assume they have more than 1 bathrooms.
AmItheAsshole,fdk90ds,t1_fdk5ns3,1578498809.0,"I had kind of the same experience as you. When I had my c-section I could only look at my daughter. I couldn’t hold her because my arms were strapped down. I didn’t get to hold her until 2 HOURS LATER. By that point I missed the window of skin to skin bonding and having her latch. And I was so stressed out being in the hospital and I felt like I was going to break my daughter if I held her wrong. The nurses were strict and wouldn’t let me do anything, like sleep with her in my arms. It wasn’t natural at all. Eventually we grew close. But those first few days/weeks were rough."
AskMen,fdj5m4u,t1_fdhtio6,1578459094.0,"I’m 5’1 and my boyfriend is 5’9 1/2, he’s tall to me. I don’t consider him short."
creepyPMs,fdj1p2g,t1_fdhltgw,1578456165.0,"That kind of happened to me once. I was out with friends and this guy started talking to me, then pulled up my OkCupid profile and said “is this you? I messaged you and you never responded.” Awkward as hell."
AmItheAsshole,fdingba,t1_fdimrte,1578446821.0,"Same here. I just turned 33, I’m in the prime of my life. Also dudes in their 30s and 40s can be really hot."
AmItheAsshole,fdimmtc,t3_elkl9e,1578446296.0,"YTA Sounds like you were looking forward to the flowers more than seeing your boyfriend. I love getting flowers, but I also love when I’m not expecting them. I thought what your boyfriend did was pretty funny and kind of cute. If I was passing by and saw that I’d laugh and say “awww”"
creepyPMs,fdilwfv,t1_fdiglkn,1578445823.0,I almost want to respond with “my hot what?” But I’m not going to engage.
Instagramreality,fdhh3qo,t1_fdgvte6,1578422515.0,"My ex accidentally elbowed me in the stomach a few hours after my c-section. That sucked. 

Also when I was having my c-section they strapped my arms down and had a sheet drawn so I couldn’t see anything. I remember that it felt like someone was punching my lungs. Once my daughter was delivered I threw up. On my back. With my arms strapped down. Ugh."
FoundPaper,fdflu8u,t3_ekxbsz,1578364696.0,I was only looking at the names and thought these were older lady names. Then I looked at the year and it made sense. I wonder what Karen’s up to these days.
managers,fdfk6so,t3_el0cd1,1578363618.0,"I used to hire for entry level minimum wage “customer service” positions. It says on the job description that we want 1-3 years relevant experience. But  I don’t specifically look for that. I need to feel like you actually care, can follow directions, can work with minimal supervision, have problem solving skills, and can take proper initiative. I’m just looking for someone who wants to work and wants to learn. I’d be curious to know why you haven’t worked until now. Were you in college? If that’s the case then college can count as experience for entry level positions."
creepyPMs,fdfi2fu,t1_fdfdboe,1578362196.0,I’m pretty sure she’s aware of her dad’s creepiness. She moved back with her mom after only a year of living with her dad.

AmItheAsshole,fcwftym,t1_fcwf8zm,1578024531.0,That’s just insane. I can’t even imagine knowing people that would do something like this and not realize how shitty it is. If I were you I’d keep my distance too. Obviously they are terrible people. More than likely they won’t even get married at all because they both sound like douchebags. Congrats on your marriage and I wish you all the best!
AmItheAsshole,fcwew1s,t3_ej5jdk,1578023856.0,NTA I think it’s fair to say that anyone who proposes at someone else’s wedding is TA full stop. Doesn’t matter the circumstances.
AmItheAsshole,fcurmkx,t1_fculki0,1577987091.0,I paid my friend $15 an hour to watch my daughter who was 10 at the time. My friend would bring their PlayStation and play video games while my daughter was in her room reading or drawing or whatever else. It was a pretty sweet gig.
Botchedsurgeries,fculmff,t1_fctx0xd,1577983693.0,"I’ve literally only ever heard guys talk about cellulite. A male coworker said that a girl’s thighs looked  like a garbage bag of cottage cheese. While most of us didn’t like the girl he was talking about, he still got his ass handed to him by every woman on our team. 

It’s weird though, I have horrible stretch marks on my butt from puberty and pregnancy and no guy I’ve ever dated said anything about it, at least not to my face. I hate it so much, I look awesome in jeans, but I don’t wear bathing suits anymore. It’s really bad."
Instagramreality,fcukb2p,t1_fcug68f,1577982924.0,But what about areolas? Some women are more insecure about that than the actual size/shape of their boobs.
