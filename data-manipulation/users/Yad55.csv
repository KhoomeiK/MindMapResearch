SuicideWatch,ff2q0yd,t1_ff2mtbu,1579518722.0,"I don’t think it gets better, just different. Maybe you might enjoy that different, maybe there’s something you’ll find that will make the suffering seem tolerable. I know it’s ironic on this sub that there’s depressed people trying to help others even though I agree with you, it sucks that someone else feels like this and there’s nothing you can do. I don’t really know what to say but I hope you find peace and reason to keep going."
SuicideWatch,ff2p0a8,t3_er6oxm,1579517195.0,"Yeah same bud, I’ll be at 30 at the end of the year I think I’ve seen enough to know there’s nothing out there but pain and suffering. Just going to suck knowing my parents will have to see a child die. 

They weren’t the best but they tried their hardest. 20 is a bit young though, there’s still something’s that I can I say I somewhat enjoyed after turning 20, of course with those highs come some lows. But I’ll remember some of those moments and those people, even though they probably won’t. 

For a moment there I thought I had it all and it was going well which now seemed like a blink of a second. But maybe stick around for your second? But 30 is a good age for me. I’m just so tired."
depression,ff1ibk4,t3_eqyok9,1579479669.0,"For me it’s like feeling like I need to be somewhere else. Like when I’m out I keep thinking I need to go home, even though I have no reason to be home. When I get home I feel alone and miserable and feel like I need to go out and do something. Always in a cycle of feeling like I need to be somewhere else but I can’t find the place."
SuicideWatch,fex52oj,t3_eqrqrm,1579424526.0,"Hey, hope your still with us bud. I can say I have been in the same place, I don’t know if it will get better for me but you just gonna keep trying because maybe it will."
SuicideWatch,fdq5cvo,t3_emmana,1578655570.0,"Congrats and good luck bud! Love seeing these posts, I think a lot of people go through what you have but don’t post when they are feeling better. Think we should encourage people to make these posts when they leave."
depression,fcmgsbk,t3_ehvibt,1577774684.0,"Hey bud, hope your leaving coz your in a better place."
SuicideWatch,fbzz1kb,t3_efa3t9,1577269557.0,"Yep, I’m in the same boat. I have a lot of the qualities people hope for but everyday it’s a battle between me and the guy that doesn’t want to be here. He just has to win once and I’ll be at peace, I just can’t do that to my family. I wish I could give these opportunities or the subjectively nice life I have to someone else."
