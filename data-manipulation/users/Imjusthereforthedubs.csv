I mean, biologically speaking, aren’t all animals wired to want to mate with the youngest, mature female? Hell I’ve seen some poor girls who were mature physically and well endowed in the chest and backside regions and I literally could not believe she was 14. I hear this argument about their mental maturity but the latest research says we don’t mature mentally until we reach 25, maybe later. So what, do we all just rape each other until we’re 25 then? There seems to be too many holes in this pedo thing, or maybe not enough info out there so people have to fill in the blanks themselves which can be dangerous.

IAmA,fems8c4,t1_femqqrl,1579268127.0,"Title IX office was terrible at my Uni. Apparently it’s impossible for a male to be a victim. I was already raped and beaten by women growing up. Then I thought I found the one, as we all do, and she turned out to be a monster as well. I tried breaking up with her multiple times, I even called the police on her. The third time I called they said they were gonna arrest me if I called again because I was lying. She lived in the same dorm and so she had access to the building and could get to my door. She stalked me non stop. She would park next to my car all the time, wait outside of classes for me, and when I’d leave my window cracked in my car she would throw things in my car. She turned all my friends against me and even most of my professors. I always had to hang out with her girl friends if I was even allowed out of my dorm and all they would do is talk about how terrible I was and how I deserved it. 

I tried going to Title IX office and they could. Not. Understand. “Wait, you didn’t rape anyone? Why are you here.” BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND BEATS ME AND MAKES ME HAVE SEX WITH HER WHILE TELLING EVERYONE THAT’S WHAT I’M DOING TO HER. “Oh, no honey. That’s not possible. That doesn’t happen. We’ve never had a single case like that before.” Okay, can you help me? “Well we can try but this was mostly meant for rape and physical abuse towards women.” I tried following up twice more before they told me there wasn’t any point because no one would believe me. I showed them texts and begged them to look at their own security cameras around campus. Still, no one would believe me. All because I was a man, and she was a woman. 

Reddit can downvote me all they want but women are fully capable of the same thing men are. This idea that rape and abuse is a purely male act needs to die. Hell, at this point women are probably worse than men because in this toxic social climate we’ve allowed ourselves to get in woman are protected like they can do no wrong. I don’t think anyone is inherently bad or evil, but if those are the words people identify with then yes. **Women are bad. Women are evil.** We need to accept this. They are people too, which means they are capable of the same things men are, right? I have a feeling that if people started listening to and believing men when they come forward with this stuff the statistics on rape and abuse would be more 50/50 instead of this idea that only men can rape."

My first play through I didn’t use any potions because I didn’t understand the point, so definitely try some potions out. The combat with swords could be better but add in a couple magic spells and drinking a potion to prep for a battle and it has some nice variety. The stories are really where it gets you. There is the main plot sure but even the side quests and the characters you meet along the way are well thought out in my opinion. You’ll cry, get angry, jealous, relieved, all of it. I could go on and on but my only complaint really is that if you haven’t read the books then it’s half as good as it could be. I never played or even heard of the first two but in the third they reference a lot of stuff that happened before that I wasn’t sure what the point was. Then I found out the game was based on books and got them and read a few. If you have the time, I recommend reading the books before/alongside playing it. They really are good books. 

If you’re expecting something like skyrim or fallout, then no it’s not like that. I feel like they have almost too much variety that it makes me anxious.

It has antioxidants in it and I believe it has the most flavor compounds of any beverage, definitely more than wine. There have been studies that say coffee drinkers live longer than the average person, but to be honest I think the average person probably already drinks coffee anyway. I remember hearing the “perfect” amount of coffee to drink is about 4-5 cups a day. I assume they are talking about 8oz cups but I vaguely remember something about coffee cups only being 6oz in most parts of the world. So basically two small 12oz coffees from your local coffee shop might hit that threshold. The diuretic thing seems to be up in the air with half the people saying yes, it is definitely a diuretic by nature, with the other half saying it might be a diuretic but it doesn’t necessarily produce diuretic effects on the body. 


There are only two things to watch out for in coffee: sugar and french presses. The french press lets more oils through but also lets some bad stuff through (I believe it starts with an E, and is carcinogenic) which if you drink a LOT of french press might cause some issues for some people but it’s rare. Sugar is obvious but if you get a froopy doopy unicorn upside down machiatto with extra fairy juice a couple times a week you have to realize you aren’t drinking coffee at a certain point, you’re having dessert."

pics,fdilh56,t1_fdif73h,1578445551.0,"According to the Vietnamese family I work for Vietnam is not doing just fine. She’s constantly sending money to orphanages, people protesting the gov’t, and trying to get her family over here to the states. They supply quite a few places in Vietnam in the food service industry over there and anyone who uses their products has their windows smashed in almost weekly. Her father fought for the South and had to go through re education camps. Her, her parents, sister, and brother fled the country by raft (yes by fucking *raft*) and when they were caught the communists wouldn’t let the sister on so she probably died on that raft. Vietnam is a horrible country from what I can tell, they’re just quiet about it for tourism and the like. 

That being said I heard the currency exchange rate is phenomenal so just save up a couple grand and you could live like a king over there."

todayilearned,fdhnoc2,t1_fdgz7vz,1578426491.0,"Netflix’s first original anime that used the 3D look weirded me the fuck out. The story was good enough to get me through the season but I couldn’t do season 2. And within the past couple months, as you said, I’ve been seeing this weird crossover between 3D people/environments with 2D shading and it’s...terrible, but in a charming way. I can see potential but right now they look like a bad video game from the mid 2000s."
nottheonion,fdhlrdu,t1_fdh8llc,1578425342.0,"I’ve never understood this. Why do we prevent forest fires in places where it is necessary for plants to reproduce? Why are we killing kangaroos for population control and grassland conservation? Why do we try to prevent things like mudslides and flooding? Why do we work so hard against nature, a battle we will never win? 

I’ve been taught in every science class that an ecosystem will only support what it has the supplies for. Too many predators? Some will die to even it out. Too much prey? Predators will thrive for a while until the cycle starts over. Desertification? Coastal erosion? These are all natural changes that are “supposed” to happen. Why don’t we just let them? 

It might seem harsh but a silver lining to Australia burning is that if the entire continent burns and sterilizes itself then we will have a blank slate to work with. Imagine a huge flat piece of land for humans to build the perfect cities and societies in their eye. Right now we have been fighting against nature and it hasn’t been going well for us. We could move the entire human population to one island nation (if they would fit) while the rest of the planet heals and develops into something new.

As soon as my friend exhaled some of that legal shit he was good for about 5 seconds, laid his head down in our friends lap, then began to bleat/scream every three seconds, on repeat, for about 45 minutes to an hour. We were out of state trying to buy REAL weed so we were freaking out about what to do. Just as we were about to call an ambulance he began to calm down. He’s never touched anything ever again, he’s completely sober from everything (which isn’t a bad thing tbh). I used to smoke it just to try something new until one day I started smoking it like it was weed, puffing and puffing, until one night when I had a bad reaction. I exhaled and my head hit the steering wheel. I couldn’t move or breathe and I was getting black areas in my vision, as well as this type if fear I can only describe as impending doom. Two girls from my high school smoked some back in the day. One died, the other is still in a coma almost ten years later.

Also it’s spelled terrible. Also the word you’re looking for is terribly. “I’m” needs an apostrophe between the I and M because it is a contraction of I and am. I is always capitalized as it’s a personal pronoun. If you’re going to capitalize Wild you may as well capitalize Hunt as well."
