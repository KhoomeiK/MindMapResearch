dating,ffnkkr7,t1_ffkg7tt,1580067226.0,"Thank you. I'm sorry if it sounded rude, kind of going over it I can see your point. I've just been so disappointed lately. I'm at a point in life where I'm doing pretty good and I want to pursue something on the side like a girlfriend. I've been trying sayings apps, going to the club everynight, and trying to be more friendly with people at work and none of it has been working. I just keep tired and mad about it sometimes"
dating,ffkez2r,t1_ffkd5t0,1580021662.0,Yeah. My bad for having standards. My bad that the online dating stock market just gives girls an extra couple points for just having a vagina. And normal guys like us are stuck with overweight 5/10 women that have children and think smoking weed is a personality trait

Dreams,ff8u6wx,t3_es7dh1,1579696220.0,"Sometimes it's just ur subconscious being weird. I still have weird dreams about trying to get back with my ex even though in real life, I haven't seen her in 4 years. Maybe a part of us will always hold on"

Dreams,ff8tyh2,t3_esaj2k,1579695982.0,"It seems like you deal with alot of pressure with school, maybe you're overstressing over homework/class work. And I think maybe you included dogs in your dream because they may be an actual stress reliever in your actual life. I hope all is well and if school is stressing you out, what you're dealing with is normal. You can do this!"
Dreams,ff8trr0,t3_es9cy7,1579695789.0,"Sorry if I'm kind of late, but you could look into exploring vivid dreams. It seems like (for me personally) I always tend to have a vivid dream when I oversleep especially after an all nighter. I also tend to dream about things that I think about before I fall asleep, and you may get answers in your dreams from your subconscious. Sometimes we already know the answers to our own personal questions and find the answer in our vivid dreams."
