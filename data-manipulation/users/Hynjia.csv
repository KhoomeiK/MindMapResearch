I'm an anarchist (which means I lean pretty heavily in the socialist direction), but I contend that, if people were as politically and economic active as they're supposed to be socialism and anarchism, then capitalism would work just fine. And, conversely, if people were as inactive politically as they are during the second heyday of capitalism today, then anarchism and socialism will both fail miserably.

I mean, I feel like our economic situation is directly related to how active people are in our political and economic institutions and less on the framework. But then...the framework kinda determines what is politically and economically (un)acceptable...so...there's that tension, too.
