penguins,ff9pyc6,t1_ff9fa3r,1579718353.0,I think J Hughes will be a dominant player in 2-3 years. I think his best comparable in playstyle and overall size is Kane.
MurderedByWords,ff64wyv,t1_ff5w0lj,1579619212.0,What state school is 68k a year? I only used post 9/11 GI Bill for two semesters and I could've sworn it capped out at a certain amount per semester for the tuiton reimbursement.

LicaniusTrilogy,fdtb5ph,t3_en2a9q,1578714296.0,Right before Asha enters the tributary and absolutely nukes the crab monsters with huge blasts of essence.
penguins,fdre64d,t1_fdre0eq,1578683201.0,You think they go with Simon Sid McCann instead of Tanev Sid McCann?

After a bumpy start, Kahun has earned the trust of Sullivan and has been put in a position to succeed with Jake going down. I think Tanev will get the chance to slot with Sid when he returns to the line up and becoming Dupuis 2.0."

Congress is responsible for any and all financial failing of Usps."
todayilearned,fclp277,t1_fclk8ka,1577753013.0,It’s intentional. Starve the beast and use the negative patient outcomes and opinions to justify fully privatize the system.
