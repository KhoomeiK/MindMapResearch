fuckthesepeople,fes92sl,t1_fes77wk,1579362731.0,"So I use Straight Talk from Walmart, have had the same number for like the past 10 years. I had a phone with Android 4.X on it and finally it was showing it's age. Apps wouldn't work on it, was crawling with what apps would work, and finally decided to upgrade ( I'm a super frugal person : save money for trips and experiences rather than throw away things ).

Anyways, my wife and I have a landscaping business where we are outside in the elements all the time, so looked up rugged smart phones when I made the decision to upgrade. The wife and I are also ham radio operators, so the built in radio features were pretty neat. 

I ended up getting the Ulefone Armour 3T out of China. Slapped my SIMM card in it and it's been a TANK ever since. The battery lasts forever as it's twice the normal size of a regular phone.
