During the period after World War II it's how we got the healthcare system we have now. There was a weird cap on compensation at the time due to certain laws and unions, which is a whole 'nother issue, but employers started competing on ancillary benefits, like dental and family health plans. 

We're in a similar situation now where workers are more scarce so employers have to compete to attract skilled labor. Maintaining full employment is one of the absolute best ways of forcing free market competition on wages and overall wage growth.
