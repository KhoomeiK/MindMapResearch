AskReddit,fgrmttg,t3_f05e09,1581050999.0,"Posture is a big factor. Things like  slouching and bending over will wreck your back. Plus if you are on your feet long hours running around a restraunt that can also be a factor. Look up physical therapy back stretches on youtube, they reaaallly do help."

I never minded talking about my scars mostly because they were from something silly I did or how clumsy I was, I always found it interesting to learn about other people's scars. They're like stories of stuff you survived and I think that's neat."

AskReddit,fgl6dbi,t3_ez0c7z,1580883551.0,When my parents use the 'your father/mother' phrase. I don't know why I hate it so much? I guess it just sounds like I picked my parents and I am getting blamed for whatever they are bickering about.

cats,ffvie5b,t3_evg1kx,1580264836.0,Definitely give him his own space. I'd start small and maybe leave him with something that has the dog's scent on it like a blanket. You could try putting the cat on oneside of the door and the dog on the other side and maybe lay a few treats out for the both of them? Sorta like when you introduce a new kitty.

AskReddit,ffpw1yx,t3_eujrdb,1580107935.0,"He's got such a personality. He loves being with people, even large groups. He isn't afraid to say hello to strangers. Anyone can pick him up, he often looooves to be held. He has quite the sense of curosity and he tends to figure out solutions to his own problems. He also plays (not always very well) fetch and we go out on walkies when it is nice out. He's my best boi."

AskReddit,fdzwn0b,t1_fdzo4cj,1578797583.0,Luckily my chem teacher was not the brightest. She gave us homework like the first week of class to do these basic math problems on some kinda online homework software. The section was like 200 something problems. I did like half and called it quits. People complained that the section was so long so she shortened it to 50 problems and any more you did was extra credit. Apparently she didn't cap it because I had over 50 points of extra credit from doing basic math. I did well that semester because how the hell can you fail with 50 plus points of extra credit.
AskReddit,fdzn4iv,t3_enggtd,1578791956.0,"My chem professor was an adjunct whose real job was a chiropractor. She would just read off these shitty powerpoints and not really answer questions. Our chem book she wanted us to have was also super shitty and often used double negatives and just bad wording in general. So most people were just really confused. When it came to the end of the semester professor review, she the left the class room to let us write our reviews for her and someone asked aloud if anyone was writing anything nice. The only responses were no."

Yes, shoveling driveways is a pain in the butt, but luckily we have a blower so it's not that bad."
