Bookkeeping,fezrso1,t3_er0em5,1579460822.0,"I’m not sure whose “job” it is, but I’m a bookkeeper, (not an accountant) and I don’t do them. For my business, my agreements say that I’ll provide the data to the accountant, but I don’t do any of the filings. But that’s mostly because I don’t want to do anything that may require dealing with the IRS."
