It's easy to come by, causes burns that will heal, would cause awful stomach problems, etc. As I say I'm not a doctor but I was a chemist once and caustic substances are weird in the way they hurt you. You typically don't notice anything at first but it hurts like hell after a while."
medical,ffiamtf,t3_ets697,1579969321.0,"NAD, could be something highly caustic maybe, that would cause the burns and stomach problems. The other symptoms could be attributed to the stress of a sudden severe illness. The trouble is you'd probably taste it, perhaps if it was delivered as a powder in a dry food you'd eat it without noticing (especially if you were a bit drunk). Once your body had neutralised the alkalinity you'd have a job detecting it I'd imagine and it probably wouldn't be routinely checked for. Highly caustic chemicals are easy to come by as cleaning products."
ukpolitics,ffgnhti,t1_fffmut6,1579910357.0,That battery pack isn't really for storage in the way you'd need it for a grid powered by renewables. It's for topping up the power to a town supplied by a grid connection that can't match peak demand. It's essentially the same every day so the battery can be scaled perfectly to cover the couple of hours a day where the grid can't keep up. For backing up renewable power you need a storage system that might need to last days - it's a much more difficult problem.
ukpolitics,ffgmxs1,t1_ffg5m44,1579909973.0,Far to little power storage to be of any use and it requires a well maintained shaft which we don't have all that many of. You've basically invented pumped storage but smaller and more complicated. Pumped storage won't solve the problem either.
ukpolitics,ffgmgc4,t1_fffnpo5,1579909646.0,Pumped storage is not the solution. It requires very particular geography to be viable as the energy density is really quite low even when the upper pool is very high. Long story short there just aren't any new sites in the UK. What pumped storage is good for is sudden spikes in demand because it's supremely dispatchable.

Damnthatsinteresting,ff10b6f,t1_ff06uyf,1579474013.0,Scott Manly briefly touched on this in one of his videos a while back. A water launch is not that much more complex and it has some big advantages that might make it worth doing for very large rockets. As you scale a rocket up the sound pressure at the hot end gets harder and harder to deal with and that comes a point where it basically rattles the rocket to bits. A water launch would dramatically cut down on this. It's only really a problem for the first few seconds where the sound is bouncing off the ground. You end up building a really tough rocket and a complex launch pad to account for a few seconds of flight - the water sprayed around the rocket at take of is mostly for sound dampening not fire suppression.

WTF,feouf1n,t1_fendpks,1579305668.0,I'm not sure if there's a bit of confusion there. Denatured alcohol is primarily ethanol which is the stuff we drink. The ethanol molecules aren't affected in any way. What they do is mix in a percentage of other things that make it poisonous to drink. Primarily that means methanol and bitrex but each country has their own recipie. Methanol is used because it's poisonous bit also because it's cheap and doesn't really alter how the ethanol works as a solvent (it makes it marginally more polar but that's about it). You can distil out the methanol fairly easily but some of the other additives form azeotropes which make them difficult to remove. Additionally it not uncommon to find small amounts of benzene in there.

For example using corn to produce ethanol has led to food shortages and a massively screwed up food market. Cutting forests down in the US so you can ship wood chips to the UK utterly is insane and releases non-trivial amounts of extra carbon. No one ever seems to count the non-renewable energy that went into making all this renewable energy.

On top of all that when you look at the figures for the amount of land you'd need for a reasonable amount of our energy to come from biomass you can immediately see it's never going to be practical.

Now for some advise / insights... you've damaged the nail bed on a couple of those fingers at least and I'm sorry to say it's unlikely to recover. Unfortunately this leads to an awkward choice with no good option. You can let your nail grow to the end of your finger which will cause a lot of dirt to get trapped under your nail which is nearly impossible to get out and uncomfortable but it lets you use your nails. Or, you can keep the nail short but this causes the nail to dig into the skin at the end of your finger which can be uncomfortable, especially if you are practical, and makes the skin at the end of your finger very tough. I tend to keep my nails short and trim / abrade away the tough skin as and when necessary (don't worry it's dead so it doesn't hurt and it only really happens on my thumbs). The main downside I find with keeping them short is that I can't use my nails to pick small things up because they are so far back up my finger, it's almost comical watching me try to pick a pin up."

Firstly, small particles tend to clump because of electrostatic forces but if they are very small other forces such as Van der Waals can come into play. Secondly, magnetism is a bulk property and it's entirely possible burning like this would create iron particles that are so small they are non-magnetic.

Anyway, good observation that rust is mostly non-magnetic. It would perhaps be expected that since iron is magnetic all compounds made from iron, such as rust, would also be magnetic but sadly it doesn't work that way. Magnetism is a complicated subject but for most metals it basically boils down to whether it has unpaired electrons. 

You can kind of think of electrons around a nucleus as as being like tiny bar magnets that follow two rules: stay as far from each other as possible (because they are all negatively charged) and all line up in the same direction (e.g. all north poles pointing the same way). If we ignoring the rare earths we see that iron is at the sweet spot where it's got the maximum number of unpaired electrons. It's a relatively small atom which helps us to pack more into a smaller space, over all this makes it the most ferromagnetic element. When iron reacts with something though it changes oxidation state which means it gives up or takes electrons (it's more complex than this) but the end result is that it doesn't have any or as many unpaired electrons so it stops being ferromagnetic. It's way way more complex than that, even at the peak of my chemistry knowledge I wouldn't have claimed to properly understand magnetism."

I honestly think it's one of those situations where you'd have to do the experiment and find out.

It's an interesting puzzle to try and think up an experiment. You'd take some steel wool, weight it, burn it as shown and weight the result. Now remove the unburnt wool and weigh the ash. If it's burnt to completion that would be pure Fe2O3 or other oxides of iron. Now you've got to separate the iron from the iron oxide which is a little tougher.

Damnthatsinteresting,fcu0g73,t1_fctbgh4,1577968217.0,"Why does anything burn is a better question. Things burn because it's energetically favourable for them to do so. What does that mean? Imagine a ball at the top of a hill, given a small nudge it'll roll to the bottom of the hill. It rolls down because it's able to give up energy as it does so. A ball doesn't roll up hill spontaneously because it requires energy (work) to be put into the system. The same is true of chemical reactions, if a reaction gives off energy then, once started, it will often be self sustaining like the ball rolling down the hill. 

Now, take the combustion of carbon:

C + O2 --> CO2 + heat

This is the formula for regular everyday burning wood. Wood doesn't just spontaneously catch fire for the same reason the ball doesn't just roll down the hill, it needs a nudge. Chemists call that nudge activation energy and it differs for different reactions, the key point though is that without it the reaction won't proceed even if it gives out energy. For wood the activation energy is moderate and wood is a fairly poor conductor of heat so once started it's easy for the reaction (fire) to continue. 

Most metals give off a lot of energy when they burn in oxygen but they also generally have a high activation energy and are good conductors of heat so it very difficult to get them to light. A block of steel won't burn when you put a match to it mostly because it conducts the heat away too fast. If you divide up the steel into thin strands or powder it can't easily conduct away the heat and it'll burn fairly well."

I've already answered this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/ehj3jy/britons_paying_40_more_for_energy_than_in_2015/fcknwvr/?context=3), nuclear doesn't have to take a long time to build. We're talking a timescale comparable to the Dogger Bank project if we pull our finger out.

>Who will built it?

Who will build the wind turbines? I would assume that we'd need to outsource at least some of the work since we've lost a lot of our expertise in this area.

>How much will it cost?

Nuclear power plants are expensive to build, no one would argue with that but once built they are fairly cheap to run. You have to look at [lifetime costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#United_Kingdom) when it comes to power. Notice how off-shore wind, everyone's favourite renewable, comes in slightly above the cost of nuclear. It's worth noting that the price for nuclear listed there is for power from Hinkley Point C which is ridiculously expensive compared to previous nuclear power, the figure was used because it's the only nuclear to be commissioned recently in the UK."
ukpolitics,fcmqq8i,t1_fcmpltu,1577787529.0,"You're really badly  misunderstanding how power is generated and consumed. Building twice as many wind turbines won't solve the problem but it will double the cost of power. It won't solve the problem because two turbines sitting in a windless field generate exactly as much as one turbine - nothing. You can improve the situation by spreading your turbines around but that requires a very large area, larger than we have in this country alone.

Let's build a theoretical country, it has power demands that range from 100GW in the middle of the night to 200GW peak demand in the day. A good carbon free mix for meeting that demand would be about 120GW of nuclear and 80GW of renewable plus pumped and other storage (with a few gas peakers on standby just in case). The nuclear would cover all the base load with some spare, the renewables would cover the peaks when they are generating or the power would come from storage when they aren't. When there is spare power from the renewables they recharge the storage."

I covered power storage options in another thread a couple of weeks ago here's a blatant copy and paste if you're interested...

Energy storage is \_the\_ problem, it's the one thing stopping us from going completely renewable and the reason why we should invest heavily in nuclear. Why should be invest heavily in nuclear? Because there is nothing even on the drawing board that comes close to the level of power storage we'd need to go completely renewable.

Pumped Storage (Water): extremely low energy density so requires a lot of space and very particular geography. Reasonably expensive to install but cheap to run and maintain. Great for very fast dispatch of power.

Lithium Based Batteries: reasonable energy density but extremely expensive, complicated and questionable safety at the sort of scale that would be required. A small number of grid level deployments but only in a load balancing situations.

Other Battery Chemistry: somewhat cheaper than lithium but lower power density and most of the same problems.

Flow Batteries: power storage is limited only by the size of the storage tanks. These have real potential if they could ever get out of the lab. Been in development for decades with no proven deployments, some interesting breakthroughs recently but realistically we're twenty years away at least.

Pumped Storage (Gas - storing high pressure gas underground in old mine shafts / oil wells): has some potential but is completely unproven and suffers from thermodynamic problems - the gas cools as it expands so you have to add heat to get your power back. Totally unproven at scale and surprisingly complex for a simple idea. Not clear what effects injecting huge amounts of high pressure gas underground will have - that's basically fracking.

Molten Salts for Heat Storage: could work (perhaps in conjunction with pumped gas storage) but totally unproven outside of solar thermal arrays (which are useless)."

I wouldn't play with UF6 but fluorine doesn't automatically make things toxic."
ukpolitics,fclfg93,t1_fcl1ht5,1577746559.0,"The problem with what you're suggesting is that no amount of installed renewable capacity in the UK will help when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine here.

To offset that you either need energy storage on an astronomic scale or you need to diversify your energy capture area enough that you're unlikely to find poor generating conditions everywhere. Since the former isn't possible we'd need to do the latter and that means building a super grid with would likely stretch down into north Africa. The cost and complexity of that doesn't bear thinking about not to mention the fact that we'd need to work closely with the EU to get access.

Storing hydrogen is an absolute mission from a chemical and physical point of view, you either have to cool it or compress it and neither is easy.

ukpolitics,fcknwvr,t1_fckadkz,1577729412.0,"Nuclear power and the long build time often come up in these discussions and I sort of agree but only up to a point. For starters we have to stop saying ""they take a long time to build"" and start saying ""they take a long time to commission"" because the actual build time is not all that long considering the size of the project. What really takes the time is planning and consent process which is out of all proportion to the impact the facility will have. For example [this](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/2027347/south-korea-second-fastest-nuclear-plant-building-country) article gives build times as low as 39 months for a plant to be build with South Korea averaging 56 months over 13 reactors. Compare that with the [new airport in Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney_Airport) which started in 2018 and isn't expected to complete stage one until 2026 (90+ months). I would be lying if I said the world average build time for nuclear plants wasn't well over 90 months but the point is when a country has the political will to build a nuclear plant in a reasonable time it can do it. Whether the UK can ever get that political will is a completely different matter.

As for other solutions to the problem I just don't see any that even come close to nuclear. I would imagine we'd need to build a grid that spanned down into northern Africa to properly run Europe using renewable power. Even then we'd need absolutely massive amounts of stored power which is something we have almost no experience of. People like to point to pumped storage as large scale stored power but it's a drop in the ocean of what we'd need.

If I had to guess which current grid level storage technology will finally win I'd say it would be flow batteries. They have the potential to be cheap, relatively safe, easy to scale,  easy to deploy virtually anywhere, etc, etc. All the others have at least one massive problem. The problem with flow batteries of course is the chemistry doesn't currently work well enough but everything else looks good."
