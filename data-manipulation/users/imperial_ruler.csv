MurderedByWords,ff8i9r6,t1_ff8hwo4,1579679722.0,"In a nutshell, it’s the idea of limiting the ability for the wealthiest people to gather immense amounts of money, typically via taxes and restrictions on how businesses can be run, as well as by mandating higher pay for employees and better benefits. The money that is no longer in the accounts of those wealthy people (who are still very rich, unless you’re far left enough to believe they shouldn’t be rich at all) is then “redistributed” to the middle and working class via tax cuts, social welfare programs, that higher pay I mentioned, and other projects intended to benefit them."

politics,ff4tz1n,t1_ff4mt2n,1579572395.0,"> Yes I do think he would have given a shit, Obama won Connecticut 60.59% - 38.22% even though their senator endorsed McCain for president. Obama was clearly more in line with the popular opinion in that state than Joe Lieberman. Their own ""independent"" senator went to the Republican convention to endorse Obama's opponent, yet Barack Obama won EVERY county in the state.

And yet Joe Lieberman killed the public option.

> Why do you think Republicans have less of these issues than Democrats? They are afraid of/respect (electorally, not actually) their base and more importantly their donors. (They know if they were to say vote for a ban on assault weapons a more conservative candidate will primary them immediately next election.

The factor to note here is that the Republican base turns out like clockwork EVERY election, while we get ourselves stuck and let ourselves waffle on whether we feel the candidate *deserves* our vote in the general. Whether that’s the right thing to do isn’t the point, the fact that it often ends in fragmentation and a GOP victory is.

> This is why it's so important for the Democratic base to get excited, involved and to be the primary source of funding for the party. It returns power to the actual constituents instead of a small handful of donors, bundlers and consultants.

I totally agree. We should absolutely be doing more. I just feel that we should remember what the game is, and what the costs are if we pay it poorly, because people’s lives and livelihoods are in the balance. And we should remember that sometimes we just won’t get what we want, no matter how much public pressure we try to put on someone.

I find it interesting that you skipped over my mention of Lieberman retiring at the end of the term this happened during. Given your argument, I think it’s a big factor in why even if you try pressure, it won’t always work."
politics,ff47y16,t1_ff463dk,1579557500.0,"> could have leveraged his support from the election he just won by 9.5 million popular votes and almost 200 electoral votes to pressure Joe Lieberman into supporting a public option.

Why would Joe Lieberman give a shit about what we think? His constituents aren’t the 200 electoral votes or 9.5 million popular votes, they’re the 500,000 people who got him elected in Connecticut. On top of that, he retired at the end of his senate term this happened during.

I hate that he fucked us over like that, but Obama had zero leverage on Joe Lieberman, and that’s not his fault.

> I’m talking going out and pushing primaries against people that don’t fall in line. It’s aggressive but its going to be necessary, and we the people will have to be massively part of this effort in terms of organizing and fundraising.

And I’m not saying don’t do this, but I am saying don’t be surprised if it doesn’t work. Not everyone is a progressive. President Sanders could go and rally all over West Virginia, and we could fundraise a progressive candidate all we want, but that doesn’t mean Joe Manchin would actually lose that primary, or that the progressive would win in the general."

There’s also a difference between the fact that people would probably benefit from progressive policies, and those people being willing to vote in officials who would enact them.

Winning the primaries doesn’t necessarily mean you can ultimately win the state in the general election.
