philosophy,ffgkol3,t1_ffga80v,1579908446.0,">But don't you exist?

Proving existence seems more definitional than logic based. Is there a way of defining existence in a way that allows us to determine what set of things are included in the definition? Rather than proving that there is existence at all, Descartes shortcut uses logic to show that the existence of thoughts prove the existence of minds.

Descartes idea was that the thought ""I exist"" could never be false  if there was a mind that had the thought.

1) If there is a mind having the thought ""I exist"" then that mind must exist.

2) My mind is having the thought ""I exist.""

Therefore, my mind must exist.

If we don't know what existence is and we don't know what a mind is, then whether or not a mind is having a thought mind be beyond our ability to prove.

>the existence of consciousness and qualia is tautological

Not if consciousness is merely a processing operation of a brain. Existence does not depend on consciousness. If we can't describe the characteristics of consciousness beyond the fact that there are thoughts then all we can conclude is that thoughts exist.

Schiff's doing the best he can, I don't fault him for not feeling like he can attack Moscow Mitch. But, I am begging, begging whoever wins the democratic nomination to call trump out during the debates. This is what I want them to say:

Thank you for having me tonight, and thank you all for coming. I’m glad to be here and I appreciate the opportunity to present my perspective and provide information to everyone watching about my candidacy. My words tonight are for John Dingell, John McCain, Humayun Khan, and all the other victims who were not able to defend themselves from the empty headed jerk to my left. I am unfortunate tonight to be sharing the stage with a known adulterer, rapist, liar, fraud, racist and bigot named Donald Trump. I have no respect for that piece of garbage standing over there and you shouldn’t either. He brags about grabbing women by the pussy without permission and thinks it’s ok because he was born rich. He has harassed dozens of women and lied about it. He raped a 13 year old girl with his friend, pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, then his criminal attorney general arranged for Epstein to die in prison so he could never testify in court. He has scammed thousands of people with his failed college, his failed casinos, his failed steaks, his failed water, and too many other scams to name. He committed tax fraud when he took a hundred million dollars from his father’s estate without paying taxes, but his biggest lie is that he has ever made any money. This guy isn’t a billionaire because all he has ever done is lose money.
Donald Trump is the biggest loser in the history of the world. If you look Google “biggest loser” you’ll find Trump because he reported the biggest loss in US history on his taxes. Donald Trump has lost more money than anyone else. Don’t believe me? Look it up yourself, right now just google “biggest tax loss Donald Trump” and you can read all about how no one else has ever lost more money than Donald Trump. He’s a fraud who lives on borrowed money that he lied to get. On his taxes he claims that properties he leases have lots of vacancies, they’re practically empty, but when he wants to borrow money from someone, because he has none, suddenly there are no vacancies! Listen, you don’t borrow money when you’re rich because you have money. Rich people lend money to everyone else because they’re the ones who have it. Trump borrows money because he doesn’t have it. You probably think that he owns lots of properties with his name on it, but nope it ain’t true. When Trump says “my building” he is lying because all those buildings with his name are just licenses and the real owners are actual rich people, not him. He had to steal money from charity just to buy a picture of himself! Talk about a vain scumbag. 
The funny thing is all the other people who take shit from him, when he’s one of the worst scumbags around. He nicknames republicans as liars and cheats and they just bow their heads in shame because he’s the king liar. They know he’s a bigger liar than they will ever be no matter how hard they try. He lied about the weather at his inauguration that we can all see on video, because no one came. He makes fun of dead US war heroes, he mocks the disabled, he threatens whistleblowers, he attacks our allies, he praises our enemies, he promotes Russian propaganda, he is a terrible person who chooses the wrong side on every issue, but don’t worry because he’ll soon contradict himself. He attacks the press on a daily basis. The best journalists in the world are in the American press. We have the most independent news organizations in the world and we have a tireless press core that doggedly gets to the bottom of stories that slip past everyone else. Tell me, do FOX news viewers love their channel because it’s foreign? Do they think Australians make the greatest fake news? Personally, I love the American press, not a bunch of sycophants funded by a foreign rich guy to trick people into being scared. If you want to support foreign companies, then go ahead and watch your beloved Fox Fake news, but personally I blocked that foreign propaganda and I think foreign companies and countries should stay out of our elections. It’s funny that all the support for Trump comes from other countries that want to bring US down, they want to hurt America, so they help Trump, think about that.
Tonight, don’t let that lying scumbag over there fool you, because he is also dumb as a rock. I bet he can’t even do simple addition. His whole cabinet knows it and they talk about how stupid he is behind his back. Every time he catches one of them calling him a moron or an idiot, he fires them and that’s why he has such a high turnover rate, so few confirmed members and so many “acting” he loves acting because it helps him keep power for himself and prevents Congress from finding out how scummy and stupid his staff is. Now I apologize for not having time to get into his criminal conduct, but for a list of his crimes, you can look at my website. There is a link on my campaign page to a list of all of his criminal acts with links to the evidence for each one. He’s an idiot just for showing up tonight because I’m going to rip him a new one while he splutters and stammers. Hey criminal, I’m talking to you, what’s 3+3+3+4? Go ahead idiot, try to defend yourself with more lies, we’re all watching you and waiting for the next stupid thing to come out of your mouth you puppet.
Wow, listen to that shocked silence. This is the first time someone has ever stood up to a bully on a national stage. I want all of the children watching who were bullied or who ever get bullied to remember this. There are people who stand up to bullies and there are times when bullies get called out. Don’t despair because there was a bully who got away for a long time, there are times when bullies get what they deserve. Thank you all again for inviting me here tonight and I hope that dirtbag recovers his wits enough to say something stupid so he can prove me right, otherwise we can spend the rest of the night just going over my plans for the country and my plans to unite us behind a common goal.

How do you see it that way? In a trial, the purpose of the closing argument is to frame the evidence presented in a way that the jury will  be able to make a decision in your favor. In this case the jury had already indicated that it didn't care about the evidence, so there was no point in making a closing statement, unless there was an ulterior purpose. The real purpose of the closing argument was for the public watching.

If I was Schiff making an argument for the public to watch, I would have made it about Moscow Mitch. I would have talked about how there was no trial because Moscow Mitch already knows that Trump is guilty. Moscow Mitch wants money from Dimitry Firtash - the man who paid Parnas to help Trump in the Ukraine. Moscow Mitch doesn't care about the Constitution or Trump's crimes, he just cares about getting Russian money. He refused to allow a trial because he wants the Russians to help Trump get re-elected. Moscow Mitch blocked us from having a trial, but he couldn't stop me from coming in here, to his house, to where he works, and telling everyone about what he was doing. Moscow Mitch couldn't stop me from letting everyone know his motives in the middle of his chamber. Where's your power now Mitch? Turns out that Moscow Mitch is pretty weak.

> If I am experiencing the Matrix, I am still experiencing something

Yes, but I'm not saying that there is a computer running a Matrix program and you are experiencing it, I'm talking about a situation in which the electrical impulses that you are calling ""experiences"" are just electrical impulses. One impulse is used and you experience heat, a different one is used and you experience a red dress, a different one is used and you experience the taste of a hot dog. You never experienced heat, or a red dress, or a hot dog, your brain was just stimulated in such a way to produce the thought that you had such an experience. If a certain impulse causes you to move your arm, would you say that you moved your arm or that your arm was caused to move involuntarily. If you were eating a banana and the hot dog stimulus made you form the thought that you were eating a hot dog, would you say that you experienced eating a hot dog or that you were involuntarily made to think that you were eating a hot dog. The fact that your experiences are just thoughts has already been proven. When you dream about flying, you don't say that you experienced flying, you say that you felt like you were flying even though you have never flown and don't even know what the experience of flying would actually be like.

>You are making the positive claim here - you are claiming that it is.

I understand that you feel this way, in fact I've discussed this with many people who felt this way before. What I've found is that it helps to talk about the simplest way of expressing our two positions.

Here is how I see my position:

I have never experienced anything other than the material world, therefore there is nothing other than the material world.

Here is how I see your position:

Subjectivity cannot be explained by the material world, therefore there must be something besides the material.

The way I see it, you are the one making a positive claim about subjectivity and I am only claiming that there is no evidence of anything immaterial.

>no amount of objective data will explain why some non-conscious objective stuff gives rise to conscious subjective experience

And we are back to non-falsifiable claims. If you believe this, then you can never be reasoned out of your position and you are claiming that reasoning with you is useless.

>I am not asserting that anything non-physical exists. I am specifically pointing out errors or gaps in the explanation and asking that they be filled

This is similar to theistic arguments, but at its best, the argument leads to the conclusion that you believe materialism could be mistaken, not that it is mistaken. If the errors and gaps that you see were filled in, then you would go from non-belief to belief? Right now materialism is all that you have, but you believe it is possible there is something else.

>Since consciousness - the fact I am an experiencing being - is the primary datum of our existence

Can we exist without being conscious? I think we can.

>materialism utterly fails to explain it

Your brain processes thoughts for a purpose. Do you think materialism fails to explain why those thoughts are beneficial to the material survival of your brain or just why you think that the thoughts are not just a material occurrence?"
philosophy,ffcx8g6,t1_ffcrdk1,1579809161.0,"> you cannot produce that very awareness in which those experiences occur. We cannot make a robot conscious, nor can we do the same with other people or ourselves; consciousness is simply there, prior to all experience - experience is only possible where consciousness already exists

I'm not sure I understand your point. Are fetuses conscious before they develop a brain? Does consciousness exist before any minds exist? Does speed exist without movement? Speed is a quality of movement and consciousness is a quality of minds. The existence of a mind causes the experience of consciousness.

>it commits a category error - it fails to acknowledge and account for this difference in kind

Only if there is proof of the existence of a different kind. Is speed a different category from motion?

>The alleged emergence of subjectivity out of pure objectivity

I'm not convinced that your view of subjectivity can be distinguished from relativity, which we agree emerges from pure objectivity.

> Simply saying the mind ""just is"" the brain doesn't answer this question

But I do have an answer to why brain's have consciousness. The same reason some brains are attached to eyes, or to ears, because creating a method for storage and searching experience in which the mind forms a model that can calculate potential outcomes of different choices was an evolutionary advantage. The first brain that was able to do it gained a huge advantage and each subsequent improvement provided a subsequent advantage for that particular ancestor of ours leading to an evolutionary line of bigger and bigger relative brain sizes with better and better modeling, storage, and retrieval systems.

What we have no evidence of, is that the consciousness is something other than a construct of the brain.

>You're starting from the assumption that materialism is true.

No, I'm starting from the assumption that I shouldn't believe in things that have no evidence of existence until there is some evidence that they do exist. To believe that there is something else other than the material would be faulty logic.

>How do we know that?

Look at speed. One person standing at a train station with a train approaching from the west and a train approaching from the east. Both trains are moving towards him at 50mph. To a person on the train, the person standing is approaching at 50mph and the person on the other train is approaching at 100mph. Each person has a different relative experience based simply on their own position. If you had the same brain and physical make up as me and all the experiences that I had, then you would have the same subjective reactions that I have.

> if all our observations of the supposed non-conscious world uses our consciousness in the first place

You are assuming that consciousness is not merely along for the ride in the same way that the eyes or the ears are along for the ride. The question is like asking how we know whether eyes really see the world if everything that we think we see comes through the eyes. It turns out that in fact our eyes don't accurately see the world and we have tests that show blind spots. This is exactly the way that we know that our consciousness does not accurately account for our decision making since we have a test that shows that our brain makes decisions without our consciousness and then our consciousness makes up the explanation afterwards.  https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080411/full/news.2008.751.html

>If I am not an automaton, but actually have an experience, why does that mean I must be able to create something I've never experienced?

Either your consciousness is the result of material processes and will always produce the same thoughts under the same conditions or your consciousness is able to create new thoughts regardless of the conditions. If your consciousness can create a new thought without any specific input, then it should be able to create a thought that doesn't rely on experiences at all. If your consciousness cannot create a thought that does not rely on experiences, then your consciousness is only a brain process akin to a computer program or automaton.

>all our theories are based upon experience

Nothing in my experience causes me to theorize that consciousness is immaterial. All of my experiences are explainable through the material and nothing I've ever experienced could have been the result of the immaterial.

>we cannot explain something using that thing in the explanation.

>all our theories are based upon experience, which relies upon subjectivity, and so our explanations require the use of subjectivity itself

This is your mistake. This is where your argument breaks down. Your assumption is that explaining subjectivity requires subjectivity and therefore subjectivity requires more than subjectivity. 

1) an explanation of something can't rely on that something

2) all explanations of subjectivity rely on subjectivity

Therefore there is no explanation of subjectivity.

Before we talk about why this argument is wrong, do you agree that this is your argument?

>My argument has been that it is in-principle impossible to explain consciousness-subjectivity in terms of matter-objectivity

Sounds like you are heading towards an ""Is vs Ought"" type of problem. Is this where you are going?

>we are effectively trying to explain consciousness using consciousness

That's pretty much the opposite of what I said. I don't actually care whether you think it's a process or an ability because I don't see a difference between those things. The only point I was making is that you think consciousness is more than just thinking.

When a computer is running a program, that could be considered thinking, but consciousness involves some additional element, in your opinion. You think that additional element removes consciousness from the material, I disagree that the additional element exists. The only purpose of my original response was to show you that you can't add something to the thinking because if you are wrong about what that thing is then you disprove the existence of consciousness."

Yes, we agree that cogito presupposes I, but you're splitting a hair that doesn't exist. Consciousness is not ability to think and thinking, if you want to consider it solely ""actually thinking"" that's fine we don't need to call ""actually thinking"" an ability we can call it a property or whatever you want. The point is that you believe there is more to consciousness than just thinking. If consciousness is just thinking then we have no need to move beyond the material. We have seen brain scans that show brains having thoughts merely as electrical impulses and we can cause a thought using electrical impulses. Your claim is that there is some additional element."

RULE 3.3: CANDOR TOWARD THE TRIBUNAL

      (a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:

(1) make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer;

(2) fail to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or

(3) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. If a lawyer, the lawyer’s client, or a witness called by the lawyer, has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal. A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence, other than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal matter, that the lawyer reasonably believes is false.

      (b) A lawyer who represents a client in an adjudicative proceeding and who knows that a person intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent conduct related to the proceeding shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.

      (c) The duties stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) continue to the conclusion of the proceeding, and apply even if compliance requires disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.

      (d) In an ex parte proceeding, a lawyer shall inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer that will enable the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse."
