AnorexiaNervosa,ff273py,t3_er2ts8,1579495696.0,"Honestly I have to be drunk or high to really enjoy it. Sex is great but when I'm struggling with Ed it's hard to just be in the moment and just enjoy it and not thinking how much ""I need to lose"" and other stupid not true thoughts. My friends with EDs also struggle with sober sex so it's nice to not be alone in that."

AskReddit,fedov5n,t3_eomkse,1579016673.0,Sweet good morning or goodnight text. Coffee and maybe a glass of wine in the evening
offmychest,fedl6h9,t3_eojf0n,1579014259.0,"I am so sorry, my heart goes out to you and your family"
offmychest,fe96gqn,t1_fe95v47,1578934800.0,Heck yeah!! Get out there do the things!!
offmychest,fe94zfh,t1_fe94dbd,1578934285.0,You got this!! This is actually exactly how my coworker and I started dating she came up to me at closing and tripped over me trying to write her number. Point is even if things don't go exactly as planned it's worth the risks to live your life. Super believe in you!!
offmychest,fe948pm,t3_eo69mt,1578934066.0,Message him on Facebook!! Just get out there and do things the outcome may be great! Or talk in person and ask to hangout sometime and give him your number.

AnorexiaNervosa,fe6wdm5,t3_eo12vv,1578906611.0,"I had the same thing when I went into recovery, I leaned toward spicy and acidic foods because they at least had SOME sort of something (pain) but eventually taste came back. I wish you the best in your recovery and hey maybe your taste will come back!"
UnsentLetters,fdkuu1c,t3_elwmc3,1578511615.0,That is heartbreaking. I'm sure you made such a positive impact on those kids lives. I'm so sorry you are going through this. You have such a kind heart I can tell. Maybe one day you'll see the kids again
offmychest,fdktsyu,t3_elnaun,1578511010.0,My heart goes out to you. My brothers are heroin addicts so when I was living with my parents I dealt with very similar situations. Im so sorry you are going through this and it's a very hard choice to make but ultimately going to the police is the best option. Call CPS and DHS about the kids. I truly do hope things work out for the best and your daughter gets help and your grandkids have a good childhood. You are so strong it takes a super human to make these choices. Addiction is a nasty disease and affects the loved ones of an addict as well. Check out if there's a narcanon near you it really helped give me a different view
UnsentLetters,fdkpz3d,t1_fdkpc50,1578508730.0,I told the assistant manager (I really don't see the manager in my department because he sucks) but he just said that it was creepy and didn't do anything. Some of my co-workers know of what's happening so whenever he's in the store I just say something to them and someone stays by my side. He doesn't approach me if there's another worker.
trashy,fdcd9w8,t3_ekjuyl,1578272095.0,Happens all the time in my department of Macy's. A kid cleared a shelf in front of me threw everything on the floor and the parent just watched.
tattoos,fbbf1f2,t3_ech2dk,1576699087.0,That is amazing!! It covered it so well I can't even see the scars at all
