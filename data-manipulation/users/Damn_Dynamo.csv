He needed to ARRESTED and put on trial. You know, so it doesnt look illegitimate. Being a government official is a pretty good protection to not get assassinated. Why is he one? I dunno, google him and find out. Could be contacts, he was a skilled military tactician.

Japan had armed every citizen, so multi million dead on Japans side aswell. That or 200k woth the two nukes? Aimed at population centres or not, it was seen as the more humane way.

Dinosaurs,fdcrn0d,t1_fdci7l7,1578282359.0,"Erm no thats not what I meant. Trex had a relatively large brain for its size, at least compared to other mega predators. This wouldve meant it had some well developed senses. Troodon wasnt the smartest, it had the largest brain to size ratio. Theres a big difference in those. A sperm whale has a huge brain, biggest on earth actually, but we have a bigger brain in relation to our size. Different parts of the brain do different things, and that I assume you know. Take trex for example. Based on its brains “layout” we can guess it had a good nose, and based on its eyes it had some well developed sight. Even so, the brain of Trex was in general larger than other mega predators. 

And heres the point we all dread. You cant compared a large predator and a smaller one *gasp*. Different niches need different things. Trex didnt go the small fast things, it went for the big game. Your Austalovenator was 6m long (about half a rex) and 500-1000kg (a rex was around 6-9 tonnes, not exactly sure). Its like comparing a lion to a house cat. Whose the most dangerous to a mouse? And who is the zebra most afraid of? 

Im honestly quite insulted you are being very unprofessional. Degrading speech isnt that attractive and just makes you look like an ass.
