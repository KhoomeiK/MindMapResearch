television,ffemq06,t1_ffeftoc,1579854794.0,"I don't know about Star Trek.

But when Disney took over Lucasfilm, the first thing they did was nuke the Expanded Universe. They released all the previous books with the title ""legends"" and essentially said ""anything in the EU that doesn't directly contradict our stuff is fine, until it does then it's not canon"", which really was code for ""the EU is dead. Welcome our new EU""

They went on to make sure everyone was aware that ALL books, comics, and video games under the new Lucasfilms were all Canon.

From my understanding, already there are contradictions happening. Disney seems to feel it's best to put out poor movies, and then prop them up with hastily made back story novels that don't affect the Star Wars universe in any significant way.

At least the original EU killed off Chewbacca, ruined Coruscant and another planet, and did some other dramatic stuff."
television,ffem45x,t1_ffe2qmk,1579853952.0,"As long as you know these key points

* Jean Luc Picard was the Captain of the Enterprise, he later got promoted to Admiral.

* He had an Android on his Crew named Lt. Data. Data was once thought to be one of a kind, however he did have an evil brother named Lore (I forget if Lore was eventually killed or disassembled or what). An important episode of TNG was where Picard had to prove that Data was a person and not a thing. 

* The Borg were evil cyborg's that had a hive mind existence. They flew in large cubes.

* Romulans are cousins to the Vulcans (ie spock), they're one of the main villains going back to the original series. Romulus, their homeworld, gets destroyed by a super nova (I believe in the rebooted Star Trek Movie with Chris pine. This creates the divergent ""Kelvin"" timeline with Chris Pine's Captain Kirk). In TNG, Spock and Picard were trying to bring Vulcans and Romulans back together and harbour peace. 



At any rate, you can watch this with very little Star Trek knowledge and still enjoy it. Obviously with more knowledge brings more understanding. If you enjoy this series, I would recommend watching TNG if you can. The first season is a bit weak, but it really picks up in seasons 4+. The finale was one of my favorite finales. It does not disappoint.

toronto,ffejmo2,t3_et1r1e,1579850734.0,">I've read on this subreddit the experiences of other Torontonians with far more violent encounters

I used to work at Front & Bay several years ago. At that time, we had a homeless woman that hung around that area. I am sure others here have interacted with her. If you were walking, she would following you and plead and beg for money ""please sir, please pleaaaaaaasse, I'm hungry, I need some food, please sir, anything"" just constantly whining and pleading. But the second we would enter our building, she got nasty. An angry tirade of four letter words that would make a sailor gasp.

One time I was with a co-worker who pulled out his wallet to give her a $5, far more generous. As soon as she took it, she saw he had a $20 and demanded he also give her the $20. When he said no (still holding his $5) starting calling him a Fucken bastard cunt face dick head (so on and so forth). Angry he demanded his $5 back, and she started swearing more at him, and he started swearing back. 

One time a co-worker was out front of our building alone, having a cigarette. She came up to him and wanted a cigarette as well. He said no, and she kicked him hard in the shin. Hard enough to draw blood, and then she ran off.

Interestingly, during the G20 summit, the homeless were rounded up. It was obvious, because there were none around at all. They all just vanished.

A few days after the G20, a co-worker said he saw her, and she looked drugged up or something, she looked worse off and was no longer pleading for money, or swearing. She was just half there as she stumbled about (she never stumbled before).

We saw her infrequently after that, and then she disappeared. There is a homeless lady I see at King and Yonge sitting on the corner, I think it might be her, but I am not sure."

In Toronto, we have street cars. There is one spot where the street cars travel down from the street level into a tunnel around a bend into a street car - station to pick up passengers. Every year, some asshole drives his car down there. 

Often it's someone who is drunk, or someone from out of town who is confused, one time a guy drove down there and jumped out of his car and ran into the station (which links to the subway), I believe the car was stolen.

They used to just have signs saying ""do not enter"" but this happened so often, that they eventually put barriers up that open for street cars. Somehow this idiot even got passed those.

This has been happening for not just years, but decades. I believe there is a black and white picture from the 60s of some car down there on the tracks.

AskReddit,fepsim5,t1_fep9rem,1579329778.0,"It's a tricky thing....

I did ancestry for my family and my wife's. A few years back, a lady from England (where my father in law is from) said that her father and uncle are brothers to my father in law. They were twin boys who my wife's grandmother put up for adoption.

This person said that her grandmother told her that when they picked the babies up, the mother was there with a 5 year old boy (my father in law).

My father in law has always been tight lipped about his history and family. He had a step father who was abusive and he didn't have a great up bringing. He did well for himself and cut most of his family off until about 15-20 years ago when he started to slowly reconnect with another step-brother and step-sister.

He never mentioned these two boys adopted away to my wife or anyone else, I don't even know if he knew about them. Even now, he doesn't say much about it, and I don't press the topic. He even goes by his mother's maiden name, which even my wife's mother (they are divorced) doesn't know the answer to why. He never talks about his father at all, zilch, and we suspect that he may not have known his father at all. It's all vague and he won't talk. So I've accepted that I won't ever know unless he changes his mind in some way.

He's also of the generation that is super suspicious. When this lady contacted me, his immediate thought is ""what does she want? money?"""
