depression,fdmyp24,t1_fdlajoc,1578571593.0,I'm scared to open up to anyone or even ask my family for proffessional help and this is the reason why. I'm already critical and judge myself. People just don't understand I didn't ask to be anxious and deppressed.
depression,fdmyf99,t3_elwlee,1578571289.0,"I relate bro I feel like everyone is pushing me to be successful and not giving a single fuck how i'm feeling. Everyone goes through shit but constantly feeling like your life is meaningless and not being able to sleep at night from the guilt, shame and self loathing thoughts. At this point my brain is not even on my side. Fuck this world I don't owe anyone anything. I never asked to be born. Even right now while Im typing this I feel like i'm being selfish for not having gratitude in life and by not having everyones interest in mind. Social media by far is the most toxic and harmful. I cant look at everyones life going perfect while mine sucks."
depression,fdmxvph,t3_elzct2,1578570677.0,The drugs and alcohol only work for the moment and then your back to your meaningless existence forever haunted by your self loathing and anxieties. I wake up knowing It wouldnt matter if I existed or not and it fucking sucks. I miss my old life man. I used to have lots of friends and a job I hated but my coworkers were like my second family. Now I just sit in my room scrolling the internet while noone. Not even my family asks me how im doing. I miss feeling like I truly had people in my life I could joke with and hang out. Ive pushed everyone out. Ive lost myself i cant even remember my old personality and how i interacted with people. Ive always had my anxieties and depression in highschool but its gotten so much worse. The drugs have made it even worse I feel like i'm not fully there while i'm sober. Like my heads in the clouds.
depression,fdmx0b1,t3_em1ggo,1578569644.0,"Social media has made my depression worse in every way possible. Im sick of seeing everyone elses success, goals, relationships and life events while I am here sitting in my room hating my self on my insecurities and anxieties. Makes you question if life is just some big fucking joke.  I've stopped using it all together but now and then I will go into it. Mainly because my only friends are in a groupchat. Even typing this right now I wonder if anyone actually gives a shit but reading reddit comments and relating to their situation is comforting none the less"
depression,fdmwhvm,t3_em5w9m,1578569019.0,"I understand being a wage slave fucking sucks and the fact that alot of us will have to work for the rest of our lives is even more deppressing. Ive never really opened up to anyone and im having trouble opening up while typing this bullshit. I excuse my life as im young I will eventually get my shit together and that might be true, But then again everyones different and im scared I could stay alone and cutting my self from everyones life forever. I just dont fucking understand what I am suppose to do. I finally got tired of it and started looking for help on the internet. And seeing other people that relate to my exact situation is comforting. I wish all of us just could be happy and not think about self worth or how others are more successful. Even though the internet is something that changed everything sometimes i wish I was just blind and ignorant to everything going on in everyone elses lives."
