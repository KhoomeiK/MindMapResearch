dogs,fg03u4e,t1_ffyotfi,1580399617.0,They are literally both bordetella species of bacteria. I never said it was cross contagious. Whooping cough serves as a frame of reference for bordetella in dogs.
dogs,ffygbjr,t3_evwmcv,1580345741.0,"Kennel cough is basically the dog version of whooping cough. If it helps, most vets will just have the techs do it, only takes a minute and might waive the office visit charge."
Hidradenitis,ffyf2qc,t3_evnciq,1580344894.0,"I’ve been on spiro for hormonal acne for the last 6 months and it’s been a god send. Even with low bp issues from another condition, I haven’t had any problems."
Showerthoughts,ffyejlx,t3_evluk6,1580344533.0,I do kids birthday parties at a museum and I have to start the happy birthday and it’s awful
nosework,ffydgtd,t3_evo2kc,1580343802.0,"We have just started, I’ve been reading everything. I’m really excited. My girl had to have minor surgery today so we are going to have a few quiet days and then we’ll work on scent intro. I’m using Abby Razer’s scent work books. Anyone have any favorite books?"
reptiles,ff1ofl3,t3_er2t27,1579482624.0,"That's a Spotted Salamander, which is an amphibian, and also a super cool find. While salamanders lay their eggs in water, they definitely don't need to be in swimming pools!"
idiopathichypersomnia,feffdiz,t1_fef9nn2,1579055155.0,"When I mentioned trouble sleeping in unfamiliar places back at the consult, my doctor said she couldn't give me anything because it would impact my results. Lots of people here said they had one, so I don't know what's up with that.

It cost me over $3500 sooooooo I really hope I don't have to do it again? And I heard somewhere else their insurance would only do one a year? Mine is garbage so.

Still can't stand the wires.

I get whack ass dreams, I think that's what my boyfriend is basing this on. 

I'm going to message my doctor and see what they say. Ugh, not hopeful."
Narcolepsy,feed8w2,t3_eopu2g,1579031362.0,"I don’t have any advice, I’m in a similar boat, I failed my psg last week because I couldn’t sleep, came home and slept five hours. It’s like being away from home and covered in wires and goo is unnatural and you can still have problems and also not be able to sleep like that.  They canceled my mslt since I didn’t sleep overnight. Not sure what my doctor is going to say. I’m worried the psg/mslt is a required diagnostic gateway that you must pass through."
dogs,fdt69yt,t3_en13cx,1578712470.0,"You tried so hard for your dog and did so many things! That’s not a little amount of trying! If the dog can’t be safe and secure and is so anxious all the time, then it isn’t living a good life either. You tried and tried and tried. Not every dog is fixable. You need to live your life too. Take care of yourself. You don’t deserve all that stress and anxiety either."
jobs,fdt2ggh,t3_emwcvs,1578711051.0,"Look up JobHero, it’s an easy way to add and keep track of this stuff right from the webpage. I think it’s awesome."
idiopathichypersomnia,fdt004a,t3_emdoad,1578710151.0,"(Also my boyfriend apologized for being an ass and brought me flowers, he knows he was out of line.) this sub is very supportive, thanks. I’ve been talking to a friend who recently got diagnosed with narcolepsy and another friend with chronic illness, they have been really nice, similar situations, unfortunately one of my annoying coworkers overheard and started telling me I should eat differently and I’d feel better.  I said “this is a serious long term problem, nibbling on some veggies isn’t going to fix it.” And my friend and boss just stared at him until he left."
idiopathichypersomnia,fdsz8mg,t1_fdq0xm9,1578709871.0,"I’m very sensitive? Sleeper, so I always have an eye mask, and when I travel I have earplugs, and I have a white noise app I always listen to, and sleep headphones. It still takes me a couple of days to sleep well in a hotel or something. My thoughts were pretty quiet, not quite meditative, but that I need to relax into the process and actively worrying about sleep won’t help me sleep, so even if I lay there all night I’m usually ok thought wise,"
idiopathichypersomnia,fdsyphb,t1_fdp4hzy,1578709672.0,"Yeah In the brief sleep I did have I actually had a dream about failing the test because I knew i didn’t sleep enough. If that’s not a clear indication of stress I don’t know what is! Just because I don’t fall asleep in random places doesn’t mean I’m not absurdly tired all the time. The environment in the study is so dissimilar to the usual sleep life, like come on. Plus they made me go to bed a 9pm and wake up at 5am which is no where near my normal hours."
idiopathichypersomnia,fdsy4sc,t1_fdoxrd0,1578709459.0,"I brought up when I saw my doctor and they suggested the sleep  I have trouble sleeping in unfamiliar places and she said she couldn’t give me something to help me sleep because it would affect the results, so?"
idiopathichypersomnia,fdsxxao,t1_fdolvwp,1578709384.0,"Thanks, it’s nice to have people that understand! I use a sleep mask, I find it helps with the hypnagogic hallucinations (didn’t know that can be a symptom). And I always use earplugs when I travel, so I don’t have to hear the weird hotel noises, and I have sleep headphones. Nothing helped, sadly. I roll from side to side, normally a small adjustment, except all the wires, it wasn’t. I’m going to message my doctor next week and see where we go from here."
idiopathichypersomnia,fdol4sr,t1_fdokcsj,1578607345.0,"Normally I'm crazy tired and sleep tons. It's just in unfamiliar locations, and also having wires, and someone watching you...If you were to look at my regular sleeping, it would be 9-12 hours, lots of naps, EDS, unrefreshing naps, etc.

I made sure I was active yesterday, so I should have been pretty tired. And I was tired. Just not able to fall asleep, and I think wires/paste/tape/finger crushed in the HR sensor didn't help. 

I have a follow up with my doctor at the end of the month, and the clinic said they would call next week, I may message them and see if they will calm my fears at all.

Also I'd rather not repeat this thing, other than being annoying, stressful, and anxiety provoking, it also cost over $3k."
idiopathichypersomnia,fdo8arb,t1_fdo14f5,1578600626.0,"Oh, thanks! I’m at a 39 on that one, I feel like it has a fuller picture of how I feel."
idiopathichypersomnia,fdo28aa,t3_emdoad,1578597546.0,"Now he did some reading and has decided I have narcolepsy and can’t possibly have IH due to its rareness. Omg. I love him but he is not helping right now, I see my sleep doctor in three weeks, and I’ll see what they tell me next week."
dogs,fciz4io,t3_eh3gql,1577673308.0,I'm so proud of you. Take care of your self and your lovely doggies.
