worldnews,ffch1e8,t1_ffcfwok,1579799288.0,Not the right kind of regulations. Can't imagine they'd have any proper food regulation just because they are totalitarian.
soccer,ff8pvn8,t1_ff8hke4,1579690975.0,Yes in general but not the looking at a keeper on his line or not part. That's fucking easy. Listen for the  ball sound and is the fucking keeper on the line then?
nottheonion,ff8hx4y,t1_ff86jf6,1579679260.0,Haha what a stupid argument. I don't really view the house loan as debt. Maybe because it costs me less every month to pay back on the house loan than to rent a place.
nottheonion,ff6z7vf,t1_ff6rn5e,1579637922.0,"In my opinion it does, mortgage is so common it's just a given. If anyone asked me if I have debt I'd say no. I don't know a single person who doesn't have a mortgage, so its implied."
nottheonion,ff6ygy2,t1_ff6rend,1579637484.0,"Well you've just ignored everyone single point I've made, since you can't argue my point other than start whole new topics about nanny states I'll accept you have nothing to say against my arguments.

I'm glad our ""nanny state"" makes sure people don't die because they can't pay medical bills, and makes sure people don't have to sleep in their cars despite working 50 hours a week. 

My point still stands, with comparable wages standard of living here is through the roof compared to the US. 

You are just in a very fortunate position, the US works for the wealthy, and yes if you make more than 180 000 a year you are wealthy, I just told you that you make just a bit less than the guy ruling my country, of course life is easy for you, you just can't empathize with anyone less fortunate than yourself. I'm betting a ton of stuff(born in a certain place, family who could afford you a good education etc) allowed you to be where you are in terms of work. Stuff others aren't born with. Not saying you don't work hard, but so does a construction worker slaving away 60 hours a week with minimal vacation and providing for his family trying to survive the US shitty system."
nottheonion,ff6j33z,t1_ff68mkc,1579628280.0,"Well I was making the point that here we get more for our money despite taxes. You respond with what you get for yours, but you make 5x more than average American does. Someone with a comparable income to mine gets jack shit in America compared to here, that's the point. 

Comparable to our salaries you're comparing me, an average Joe with someone with MORE income than the highest government  officials and CEOs here. Luckily our government officials pay are public and your claiming to make slightly less than the prime minister of Sweden. Haha wtf. Either you're lying or you are just very rich. 

Yeah nice comparison."
nottheonion,ff6fs8g,t1_ff68pxf,1579626247.0,"Also, what average American have ""truly unlimited vacation"" haha you're delusional or something. I know for a fact from friends living in America that even having vacation is considered luxury. Some have 1 week or max 2 a year. The ones with good jobs get 3-4 weeks after many years with the company."
nottheonion,ff6ewqm,t1_ff68pxf,1579625701.0,"You make almost 5 times the amount of the average American your age(google it, almost all sources put it at 40k average for 27-34 yes). you make sooo much more you have no idea about the average Joe lol. I make comparably 40k American dollars as well. Of course someone who makes 5 times more than me would live better rofl. 

That said. You make 5 times more and I bet it's not even that far apart in standard of living. Sure I drive a 2014 car, but am about to build my dream house in a good area and with kid, going on vacation every year... Imagine making your money and not living that much larger than someone who makes 5 times less somewhere else."
thatHappened,ff627z0,t1_ff621zy,1579617273.0,"Yeah I don't doubt it just don't know if the ""most"" part is true. At least not in my experience."

thatHappened,ff61dfa,t1_ff60syw,1579616638.0,"As someone who have tons of friends with kids who have passed the 2 year old mark and also has an almost 2 year old myself, that is not my experience at all. Sure they all say some stuff but not in full sentences."
nottheonion,ff5yfgc,t1_ff5y5vc,1579614288.0,Is that your bedroom in your parents house?
nottheonion,ff5wo1a,t1_ff5uzml,1579612751.0,"Haha. I actually live in Malmo. Everyday life for almost all people are just normal. Some wannabe gangster kids are fucking things up and they are not that many. But living here I haven't noticed anything when going about my daily life. 

Still it's not like many people like to paint it out to be. Still there's a lot of problems of course, but there is many good things about Malmo."
nottheonion,ff5p7mw,t1_ff5otrj,1579604349.0,"I get around 80% of my pay while on leave. The government pays. It's up to the job to handle it but it's so common that most companies  are ready for it. 

In my job I am easily replaced and coming back is not hard. But for some jobs it can be hard, then you have to have a conversation at home about who takes most of the paid days. I think in total I have around 400+ something days to split among both parents. Mostly money decides. The one who makes more money takes the least days. Luckily me and my SO makes about the same so we split."
nottheonion,ff5oa63,t1_ff5nb7u,1579602976.0,Haha your post is even making my point. Rofl. Who's the moron.
nottheonion,ff5o4g1,t1_ff5nb7u,1579602739.0,"From talking to Americans while gaming my whole life and on reddit you seem to be an exception and have a REALLY well paid job. My point was I'm working a very average paying job as do my friends, and we still have a very high standard of living. You are rich compared to the average American."
nottheonion,ff5mhqn,t1_ff5meao,1579600249.0,No. The point I was making is everyone I know already has this and NONE of them are rich. Everyone is working normal jobs with average salaries. That is my point. The rich are another story.
nottheonion,ff5mbfa,t1_ff5m5yq,1579599980.0,I live in Southern Sweden and we barely get snow at all anymore. Winter is about 4 months and it feels like fall weather.
nottheonion,ff5ma10,t1_ff5m18r,1579599921.0,"Haha. I keep a lot more than half my paycheck. Also, you have to measure what you get out of your paycheck. If you keep all of your pay but you can still not attain the quality of living that Scandinavians have then it doesn't really matter. It's all about what you get. I bought a newly built apartment, new car and can buy pretty much anything I want, 6 weeks vacation and extremely long paid kid leave and free healthcare. This is on a very average salary In Sweden. From reading reddit people with average salaries in USA can barely get a place to live nowadays. USA is like a 3rd world country at this point."
nottheonion,ff5lv0g,t1_ff5ky6m,1579599278.0,"Yes no debt from having kids. Ah yes maybe I was a bit unclear. I mainly mean no debt from education/medical that a lot of Americans pick up. 

Everyone who bought houses/apartments have house loans, I didn't think to mention it since it's so common, pretty much no one can buy a house without a loan anywhere."
nottheonion,ff5ix2f,t1_ff5csjg,1579594985.0,"In my country American dream is like the norm. I'm in my 30s now and all my friends/everyone I know and everyone at work is already there. Either bought nice apartments in the city or have houses outside it... Kids and all that shit with no debt. Come to Scandinavia(or not please). 

Also 6 weeks paid vacation. I have too much vacation saved as I can't spend it all because of my 1 year paid kid leave. Must spend vacation somehow!

Edit: just to clarify. We all have house loans! I meant mostly no medical/educational debt. Don't think anyone can buy a house in any country without a loan unless you're rich so I thought it was implied, sorry."

soccer,fd8lib8,t1_fd52obs,1578219746.0,United player is running straight. Wolves player comes from the side trying to get back into shielding the ball. A last second leg in front of the United played doesn't mean he's shielding the all at all. It ends up as a kick on the United player. Also United player is the only one to actually touch the ball here. Still hard to decide.

IAmA,fcm23tq,t1_fclsb4f,1577762229.0,It's not the same color as the gloved hand to the right of it. Also there are 3 diagonal lines going through it doesn't look like a hand/arm at all.
IAmA,fcm1xlb,t1_fclluvt,1577762101.0,Nono it's right to the left of the gloved hand. Literally looks like a spine with diagonal spaces between bones.
