TheRightCantMeme,ffvb1mw,t1_ffhrv7d,1580259906.0,"I don’t know what you mean by your question. Maybe you’re suggesting that high schoolers are removing opportunity from college grads?


Been talking to all of the tradesmen I know. Every single one is looking for at least 2 people to hire. My tally is about 600 open jobs starting between $13-$15/hr.  The average being $14/hr.
Idk if I’m still missing something. 
I understand that specific industries standardize $7.25/hr.
I also was ridiculed by my family for becoming a tradesman instead of going to college. I now make more than all of my 3 college graduate siblings all with vastly different degrees.

I’m not fighting a rise in minimum wage.

My point is that there seams to be many openings for decent pay (at least in my area).
I wish other business owners would be more connected with those that make things happen for them. I couldn’t pay so low as $7.25 and not feel like I have a character flaw."

Had a roommate pistol whip himself multiple times with the last firearm he owned. This firearm was confiscated shortly after.

I had an altercation between the same roommate and my girlfriend and I. 
Roommate was perp. Received a domestic violence charge that would keep him from having a gun.
He’s been hostile towards plenty of people and animals.
Gets domestic violence charge(that would bar him from owning a firearm) dropped in plea deal.
Wouldn’t be surprised to see him get another firearm which he shouldn’t have."

The study is solid and well rounded but it doesn’t cover everything. Nothing does.

When someone asks you what you think, do you ask them to read the study you showed them already? 
Opinion, what do you think, what is your take, what is your viewpoint in your own words?

I read the study you linked. I’m trying to start a conversation and it’s going about as well as with a bot. The only difference is the distain and and glomming onto someone else’s work that I see here. 

The fact that you don’t think I read the study and that the study is what you defer to in place of an opinion or a refusal of opinion makes me feel like you probably have been nailed for plagiarism in school before"

Study communism. It looks great in many similar ways as this study.  
I am NOTNOTNOT!! arguing that gun control is communism.  I am trying to point out a different angle here.  Let’s talk this over rather than trying to run a quick buzz comment throwing flak.

I have read the study you gave me; thorough, groundbreaking, and quite educational from the gun control perspective. I learned quite a bit.
 I’m trying to ask about what we would see objectively, initially, as well as formally. Not only the previous but reactively. 
How does the public act, and what turning points are there to consider. The best of answers to the heavier problems of society can be downtrodden for reasons other than logic and effectiveness.
  I feel as though I have come across as pro firearm leftist. In reality I hope to convey that I seek to explore solution no matter where the answers come from. 
 Say for example arming everybody actually solved gun violence. Great, prove it thoroughly because I don’t want to chance major loss of life with a less than thought out decision.

I apologize for my lengthy reply, but I truly do want to see a debate. I appreciate the reply with the study. I think that was a superb comment to share.  
What do you think though? I want to hear what you think are the biggest oversights in the pro gun argument?  Sure I can see the study, but does this study speak completely for you? What’s your take?"
