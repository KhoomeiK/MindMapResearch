ketobeginners,ff94ztr,t3_esa3ig,1579704977.0,"I find it helpful to start keto and do it for a week or two before introducing fasting. Honestly, keto kills my appetite so fasting including OMAD actually is easy once keto kicks in. 

Just a thought."
Showerthoughts,ff94l15,t3_es8lmh,1579704697.0,"I’m an adult. It’s still mainly a happy experience. 

There are times when drowning my sorrows in chocolate chocolate chip works but I try not to use food this way."
RedditForGrownups,ff94cw2,t3_es7jua,1579704545.0,"I have a strong spiritual belief. I get that’s not popular on Reddit but it helps me immensely. 

I faced a very scary health crisis in my late 30s and I had peace through it all. My Dad broke down one night over it and asked me how I could be so calm while facing the prospect of possibly not making it out alive. I told him this: (1) How does falling apart help me? It doesn’t so I choose not to.  And (2) I absolutely believe in God so I have no doubt that I’ll either wake up surrounded by my loved ones or I’ll be with God in Heaven. Either way it’s good for me so have a funeral or memorial or whatever you need to feel better but know I’m good either way. 

Now, I’ve always been super independent  and want to be in control but a switch went off when I got the news of my health crisis because I realized there was nothing I could do other than stay positive and pray. I couldn’t solve the issue only the doctors and God could. Instead of scaring me this thought gave me the freedom to let go and trust God. 

I’m still pretty independent but since that experience and a follow up health crisis 10 years later I’ve let go of the control thing. I make my plans but no longer get upset when life happens. 

Obviously, I’m did not deal with my health crisis perfectly. I did break down twice over it. Once at work and then when I had to check in at the hospital. But other than those two times I had peace."

Ask_Lawyers,fd6exei,t1_fd67yyd,1578189944.0,"This is so true. I went to law school to do international law and diplomacy. I realized international law wasn’t for me pretty quickly and I definitely do not have the personality to be a diplomat. 

Ended up doing intellectual property law once I graduated even though my least favorite class was administrative law and I swore I’d never do any law that required me to do it.  So glad I had a science background so I could sit for patent bar as I love it. 

Sounds like OP would prefer transactional law but you never know until you get into it."

CPTSD,fcflc0r,t3_eh4pzk,1577631265.0,"I think of it as I have no idea what another human being has gone through or is dealing with so it’s not my place to judge their decisions as I have no idea how I’d behave in the same conditions. 

However, I do avoid mean people and ignorant people and hurtful people as much as possible. I’m not hanging out with bad behavior."
