The heart of the story is Ray Fisher's Cyborg, a.k.a. Victor Stone. Vic takes a path from torment and disunity after losing his mom and his humanity, to finding his new self through helping the League and embracing his powers. Classic hero's journey. We see him as a college football hero, we see him in school, with his parents, etc. We see him and his mom killed in a crash and his life brought back, all of that. He's the core story and we follow him.

Bruce is aware of a growing threat and actively hunting down super people to join up with him, corresponding with Diana, and trying to get a massive 'Flying Fox' aircraft in working shape.

The story goes into some depth on The Flash and Aquaman but that hasn't been super illuminated yet. We know some time's spent with Barry and his love interest Iris West and a little more with his father who's in prison and his drive to become a criminal scientist or what-have-you. And Arthur with his struggle of being half-man, half-Atlantean that would eventually be explored in his solo film. Several Atlantean characters introduced were later cut or reduced to bit roles.

SO... Steppenwolf invades, just like in the theatrical cut, looking for motherboxes. Raids Themyscira and Atlantis... The Atlantis sequence is much longer. He comes to Earth, somehow Victor's father Silas is killed... At some point after that, the League finally comes together and forms a plan. Victor uses his Cyborg powers to see into the history of the motherboxes, going back through involvement with the nazis and all the way back to early man. They learn about an ancient battle that occurred when a young Darkseid (familiar with him?) came to Earth seeking the anti-life equation and wielding the power of unified motherboxes. The old gods of Earth: Zeus, Ares, and Artemis fought Darkseid off (with help from the Green Lantern corps) and broke up the motherboxes, then they separated and hid them: one on Earth with man, one in Themyscira with the Amazons, and one under the ocean in Atlantis. The one on Earth is the one that eventually brought Victor back to life. Then they're all, 'Hey, does that mean it can bring back Superman too?'

They resurrect Clark, but he's not himself. Evil Clark. Massive battle in the park ensues, longer and more involved than the one we saw in theaters. Clark embarks on a confused journey to sort himself out. He visits the old Kryptonian ship from Man of Steel, gets the BLACK SUIT (confirmed by Snyder), spends time at his mom's farm, etc... At some point he reconnects with Lois and finds himself to some degree, but not fully.

Bruce realizes the relevance of his vision from BvS, when Flash appeared in his Batcave screaming ""You were right about him!"", ""Lois is the key!"", ""Am I too soon?!"" and shit like that, and the strange vision of that apocalyptic planet with duster-wearing, gun-toting Bats and evil militant Supes. It turns out that's Earth, after Darkseid has invaded again and defeated the League. This all happened because Darkseid boomtubs into the fucking Batcave at some point and kills Lois, sending Superman off the deep end of rage and resentment and turning him evil. This would all happen in Justice League 2 or 3, I believe.

So anyway..... The League comes together by each solving their own personal puzzles. Bruce learns to embrace others, trust in the future again, share leadership, open himself up. Barry learns to express himself and have confidence in his abilities and thus himself. Diana learns the necessity to protect humanity, or something, I'm not really sure on her arc honestly. But above all, Victor learns to embrace his new identity and finds power within himself by devoting to the Justice League and defeating Steppenwolf. He unlocks his powers through the motherbox and through atoning with his parents' loss and asserting himself on his own. Bruce actually tries to sacrifice himself at one point, but the League intervenes or something, or somehow it becomes clear to him that he's a part of something bigger than himself and he should stick around and trust in his team members to get it done.

In the end, Diana decapitates Steppenwolf and his severed head rolls through a boomtube to land at Darkseid's feet. The League, including Superman, make eye contact with Darkseid and the rest of the Apokolips family, then the tube closes.

Justice League 2 would have seen the League traveling to Apokolips to take down Darkseid, but failing. I think that's when he'd kill Lois. Justice League 3 would have Darkseid's invasion of Earth, which would result in the wasteland we saw in BvS. Bruce, Barry, and Vic are barely hanging on against Darkseid and evil Superman. Vic sends Barry back in time to warn Bruce about everything, but Bruce tells him to choose a different exit point for the wormhole because the one he would have chosen is too soon (the Flash portal scene from BvS). It's sorta cloudy after that, but I assume they defeat Darkseid, and there's a strong rumor that Bruce ends up saving Lois but dying for the cause and that helps redeem Superman's character.

Other notable things that were cut:  
\- Ryan Choi, a.k.a. The Atom, as head of Star Labs working with Silas Stone  
\- Hal Jordan, a.k.a. Green Lantern, who visits Alfred at the Wayne lakehouse and possibly joins the final fight  
\-  J'onn J'onzz , a.k.a. The Martian Manhunter, who disguises himself as Martha Kent to have a conversation with Lois at one point and is revealed to have previously disguised himself as General Swanwick. His motives aren't clear yet.

WB decided they didn't want to bother taking this whole dark, heavy journey across three more movies and tying all these lofty arcs and concepts together when the reaction to BvS wasn't all roses to begin with. They wanted to clear the way and make room for fresh starts like Shazam!, Birds of Prey, the Suicide Squad reboot... They're just not interested in Zack's brand of hero anymore. They've given up on the big picture."
