They managed to get in at about 4:30am.  Aparently once you get in they took their coats, separated them, ran tabs with their cards and plied them with liquor and women to keep them from leaving.  They wanted to leave but to close the tab they had to go to a different floor, upon arriving oh hey here is a free dance and some shots.  Tried to get their coats which again required going to a different floor.  Every time they almost got out they'd turn around and another guy was missing and they had to go back in after him.  Eventually one of them faked being sick and they had to ""help"" him.

They thought they were out at 3am but the place was a ways away from the strip and they got there in a free limo ride.  They were arranging to get ubers when the limo guys show up and say they will take them home for free if they go back in for a little bit.

NONE of them would tell me how much money they spent in there out of embarrassment.  I'm assuming it was insane.

All in all pretty glad I stayed back at the hotel."

AskReddit,fewnkym,t3_eqies2,1579415879.0,"Not really a glitch in space or time but just me messing up on a prescription.

I had knee surgery, and it being 2002 they were pretty much throwing opioids at me like crazy.  For a couple weeks I took them and sort of got into a routine.  Wake up, take pills, go to sleep, rinse repeat.  Then they refilled it but changed the timing and I didn’t read the bottle.  I forget the specifics but basically before I could take one and then after several hours it was worn off enough that I could safely drive.  I took the new ones and assumed the same, got in the car and drove to the next town over after what 1 day ago would have been enough time to be safe driving.

I distinctly remember passing the interstate on-ramp and decided to take the country road.  I blinked and next thing I knew I was on the interstate and 10 minutes had passed.  I only came to because I was being honked at as I was still going the country road speed instead of highway speed.  I called my mom and had her come get me.

I have NO idea how I got on the interstate.  Did I turn around?  Did I drive down the off ramp the wrong way?  Did I drive though a field?  I have no idea and to this day it still scares me what could have been.

It is a freaky story that has no explanation but it is also pretty serious so I’ll say the following.  Don’t assume a doctor or pharmacist did what you expect, read every bottle, every pill name and understand what you are getting.  Meanwhile understand that some doctors don’t appreciate the danger of opioids and massively over prescribe them.  Patients who follow orders have no idea they could potentially be on a dangerous track towards addiction.  If you are prescribed painkillers, make it a point to force yourself off them as soon as you possibly can! Your body and your brain might tell you you need them, but you really should power through and take them only when you absolutely can’t help not doing it.  They are too serious to treat lightly."

I lived on the other side of my rural town from my cousin.  Either we were on our way to my place or his place and had taken that drive so many times.  Being in the country there wasn't really ever any traffic and the trip always took about the same amount of time.  Usually about 12 minutes.

One day we were really jamming to a song and pulled in the driveway just as it finished which was then we realized, wait.... that song is only 3 minutes long.  Either we were doing 200 mph or we traveled through time.
