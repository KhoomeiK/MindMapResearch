trashy,ffg07yu,t1_fffypsq,1579895640.0,"If this guys entire career could be put at risk from fishy behavior, then shouldn't he refrain from that behavior?  Does this guy get a pass his whole life for being *mostly* an asshole just because he spent a long time in college?  Maybe we should let anything slide as long as it's lower than, say, vehicular homicide.  Now, if he spent even more time in school, maybe that would be okay, too."
trashy,fffzagc,t1_fffte81,1579895064.0,Doing something douchey that could cost you your job that you went to college for seems soooo ridiculous.
gundeals,ff2ti6q,t1_fev27lc,1579523513.0,"That's not a recall. It's a consumer safety alert. A part should be examined... You can examine the part with instructions, a qualified person could examine part, or S&W will examine that part.  You might say, ""isn't that a recall?"", but it's a lot different than a recall.

I might guess, not to put words in Appleseed's mouth, that they could be satisfied with a recall program and nothing short of that."

Jokes,fdkede7,t1_fdk0gwc,1578502085.0,"Yeah, reversed or not, I still don't see what the humor is.  At it's heart this is a *joke* about a woman who has done literally nothing wrong.  (Her husband is cheating on her, so she's just a victim, too.)  And her reward in the joke is to be repeatedly verbally insulted by a random man that comes to her doorstep.

I don't *get* why us, the viewer, should take any pleasure at her discomfort, nor why the man at the doorstep should take out any ire on her.  The wrongdoers in the story are the husband and that man's wife.  Come on man, put your anger in the right place!"
