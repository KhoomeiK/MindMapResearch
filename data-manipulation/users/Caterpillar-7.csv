horror,ffgbicp,t1_ffgb075,1579902593.0,"It really is. I’ve been watching so many movies that just aren’t doing it for me, including a lot of the ones recommended on the sub, but this series is awesome."

horror,ff9aczi,t3_es54hr,1579708465.0,I don’t think there was just one. It was a culmination of slowing realizing I liked the thrill of the unknown and mysterious and being disturbed that crept up on me over time. And it was not just movies but books too.  Everything over the course of like 15 years developed into a full-blown love of the genre.
horror,ff99zqn,t1_ff84ksi,1579708234.0,Yessssss

horror,fez386c,t1_fewi1pg,1579453476.0,"I agree. Indifferent towards the relationship, not outwardly abusive. I actually felt bad for the guy at the end."
horror,fez2qt6,t3_eqxczc,1579453321.0,I think the actual last scene of the movie where the underground gets flipped is my favorite scene. Great movie!

horror,fe95y4k,t3_eo27dp,1578934623.0,Not sure if in the minority but this movie didn’t get me at all. I found it slow with no payoff or real plot. It was so predictable. I really wanted to like it because I love Scarlett Johansson but ended up having to skip forward through a lot of it.
horror,fe661de,t3_enf71m,1578882587.0,Ughhhh I’ve seen this recently and can’t remember its driving me crazy
