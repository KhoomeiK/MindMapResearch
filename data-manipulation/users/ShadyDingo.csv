gifs,ffq3em8,t1_ffq0igw,1580118242.0,"Perhaps I could have worded it all better, because its not my intention to downplay what he did to the victim. Rape is rape and it isn't at all okay or justifiable by any measure. With Kobe's passing I hope that his family and fans can mourn the loss in peace. What he did was wrong, and I hope that his actions haunted him into being a better person from that time forward. He wasn't a Harvey Weinstein or Epstein, which is good, but still isn't good at the same rate. I hope my thought process is coming across better."
gifs,ffpomml,t1_ffpkpbt,1580100480.0,"I don't think anybody is praising him as a saint, its more that the loss of life is tragic, including his young daughter dying with him in the crash along with everyone else which should also be important, not just Kobe. The way I see it, he did a terrible, inexcusable act in his time, but that shouldn't be the only thing remembered about him. Being able to recognize his talent and ability and separate it from his crimes is important, but its more towards the idea of forgive but never forget perhaps. I can only hope that after that trial he did what he could to be a better man, for himself and his fans and family.

RingOfElysium,ffllh2u,t1_ffl5073,1580041083.0,"Another tactical gadget is a vehicle modification kit, which alters many of the cars and boats in game to have more utility like boosters, turrets, radar, etc. With this release they added rpgs to help provide an infantry vs vehicle element. They're garbage vs players directly but do sizeable damage to vehicles. Its been a point of contention with the community, which i believe has some merit being that grenades are still superior vs players than rpgs"
RingOfElysium,ffl3kbj,t1_ffkw65e,1580034168.0,"So the cloak is the newer of the three mentioned, it covers you in a transparent blanket that you can see through, and you can somewhat be seen if you move around but otherwise its almost unnoticeable. You move super slow, and the audio is super refined, almost makes it like you're listening to everything in a tin can of sorts, but it sounds nice, if that makes sense. The shield is simple, you throw down some bullet proof cover that's fairly large, and can't be destroyed by anything but I believe grenades and rpgs, but nice in a quick pinch to get a buddy back up or have reasonable mobile cover if you're out in the open and need a few seconds to readjust your strategy. The hologram throws down a copy of your character in whatever position/stance you're in, and if someone shoots it, it'll ping their location to you and your teammates. Its sort of the weaker one of the bunch in my opinion, because once they hit it and it fizzes a bit and they realize its a hologram they won't hit it anymore, but its still fairly neat. Imo I think they should have done the hologram like they did in Halo, where it send a copy of your guy moving forward for a few seconds so its a moving target that looks like it might be the active player."
