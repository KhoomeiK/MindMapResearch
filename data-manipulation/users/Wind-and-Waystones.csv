This actually has a reasonable opening for dimension hopping and gives a more reasonable excuse for it being a smaller role. It also seems to be the only non-mcu Spider-Man property that has been handled right in recent years."

todayilearned,fdkztk7,t1_fdkg7re,1578514525.0,It's only partially bullshit. People have known for a long time that boiling water makes it safer to drink but they also know that the process to make beer involves it and the combination of alcohol and hops stops it spoiling. When in a situation where the water is questionable and you don't have access to the resources to boil it beer is a safer alternative. The same applies to wine where a lot of old wine would be lower strength or even watered down to hide the taste of questionable but likely safe water.
todayilearned,fdkyba7,t1_fdkqizb,1578513664.0,"No it means you can buy more for a net increase in total alcohol consumed for your money. You spend the same but get drinker.

ChoosingBeggars,fdjj40v,t1_fdjfeq1,1578473174.0,"Dude, I used to be in the same place as you. I thought it was helping my depression but it turns out it was actually amplifying it. If I wasn't at work I was stoned as fuck every single day for about 10 years. The past year since I quit I've never felt better, not to say I feel amazing, and descend in to a mental downward spiral so much less. I highly recommend quoting at least for a month or two and see how it alters you. The key is to find ways to exhaust yourself mentally and physically to help with the sleeping and eating. I'm even at a point where I can smoke it once in a while now and actually feel some benefits instead of just trying to feel my warped version of normal. That's just my experience though and like you said everyone is different."
