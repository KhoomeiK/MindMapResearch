shittingadvice,ffr3ml2,t3_euqvpq,1580149732.0,Try a Fleet enema. They're not as scary as they appear and it will loosen things up and get moving. Make sure you're well hydrated and follow the directions. I hope you feel better soon.

shittingadvice,ffhx7zj,t3_etiya8,1579957881.0,"My advice is to try to control your diet, lots of water and fiber. Don't strain and perhaps invest in a [squatty potty](https://www.squattypotty.com/). I know surgery is an option but as a last resort. I hope you get relief soon."

stopdrinking,feu42tp,t3_eqlibm,1579382943.0,"Same. Moderation for me is like driving on a very narrow road with steep drops on both sides. Why try to navigate that when there's a safer, wider path with room for buddies?"
popping,feu338x,t3_eqlhv9,1579382686.0,Fascinating. I want one for my curio cabinet. I have one a buddy of mine gave me but it's 500x smaller than these bad boys.

shittingadvice,fes5jfo,t3_eq7abq,1579361631.0,"Just looks like toilet paper or mucous. If it’s TP then you have nothing to worry about. Mucous isn’t that unusual, but if you’re truly racked with anxiety maybe it’s time for a routine checkup with your primary care doctor. Mention your poop! It’s important shit."
