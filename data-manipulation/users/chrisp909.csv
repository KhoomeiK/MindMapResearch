Correct, [that's what the graph shows](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/images/epidemic/3WavesOfTheRiseInOpioidOverdoseDeaths.png).  That prescription peak is where the start point for heroine deaths trend line begins it's increase.   As the prescription trend take it's first significant decline in a decade the heroine deaths begin to incline rapidly.

Prescription prices have remained fairly steady but supply and demand has driven heroine prices down, purity up and availability sky rocketed.  That's a potential reason why once addicts began turning to street drugs the death rate rose so quickly.

UpliftingNews,fffmp7n,t1_fffiyk0,1579887274.0,"**The links shows** the growth in numbers of people who have died since the aggressive and deceptive marketing of opioids started in the 1990's. In the 1990s doctors began prescribing new opioid drugs because they were being heavily pushed by these drug manufacturers.  

Prior to this opioids were mostly prescribed mostly for cancer or other life threatening illnesses for temporary relief of major pain.  Doctors began prescribing more for chronic pain until by 1999 86% of scripts were for non-cancer patients.  Because they were supposedly safe.  


* Doctors were told the drugs had very little risk of addiction but the manufacturers knew this was false.  
* The manufacturers aggressively marketed the drugs even offering doctors money from the companies for prescribing more opioids with full knowledge people were getting addicted and dying.

It means what I stated.  This guy and these companies lied, promoted and aggressively sold a product they knew was killing people and 5 years for being part of the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people seems a little weak.

Was there something specific that you didn't' understand after reading the article?"

[The CDC estimates 700,000](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html) people in the past 20 years have died because of this asshole pushing opioids to the general public like they were candy.   That's more Americans than have died in the Gulf wars.  That's more Americans that have died in all wars combined.

In CDC link note the relationship between the waves of overdose deaths.  When the prescription deaths reached a peak around 2010 heroin deaths began to exponentially rise. 

This man should rot the rest of his life in prison but the US has a very different justice system for billionaires and politicians."
