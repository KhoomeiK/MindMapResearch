AskReddit,fb9j16b,t3_ec5e22,1576639889.0,"A conversation that I misheard—before I realized that I misheard it. My SO and I were on a cruise ship just hanging out by the pool. An elderly woman walked by us and said something about how “there will be ghosts roaming the halls tonight”. My SO turned to her and said, “you’re gonna be one of them!” He rarely talks to strangers, let alone says something so bold. I couldn’t believe that he implied she’d be dead by that night. I mean, she WAS old, but still. I kept laughing long after she had walked away from us. Except.....that’s not at all what happened. She actually made a comment about how there will be DRUNKS roaming the halls tonight and my SO said “I’m gonna be one of them”...
