Whiskyporn,ffh7ph4,t1_ffh7bom,1579925470.0,Got that for my 24th birthday for myself. Laphroaig is my favorite distillery.
Whiskyporn,ffh6tdy,t1_ffgystt,1579924726.0,That’s reasonable. I gave it a good shake and it seems to be moored in studs. I don’t plan on leaving it there forever though.
motogp,ffgbul1,t1_ff7htm5,1579902798.0,"That was a great read though I don’t fully understand:

-what is the “screamer mode” firing order?

-what is the “Big Bang” firing order and why does it give better traction? 

It also said Big Bang gives better acceleration, which I assume is due to greater torque from multiple cylinders firing simultaneously. That’s about all I could figure out."
motogp,ffgavdv,t1_fffdwo5,1579902201.0,"I like your prediction though I think it’s *unlikely* that Yamaha/Maverick will fully fix their start problems. I also think it’s unlikely that Marquez will get bogged down very much, though if he does—and if he pulls any more dangerous moves to get back to the front —I’d love to see race direction come down a little more harshly."

TwoXriders,ff8dpe0,t1_ff8401s,1579674194.0,I’ll DM you. Glad to hear I come across that way. That’s my intention.
TwoXriders,ff6yn7h,t1_ff4zada,1579637585.0,"I’m a guy but I teach the riding course in California. One thing that I do with shorter riders is the following:

-sit on the bike with the engine off

-put one foot up on the peg (let’s say left for now) the right foot down. Be sure that you’re settled on the seat, allowing your arms to fully relax, taking all the weight with your leg. This will teach your body that all you need is one leg for support.

-then push off, and bring your right foot up to the peg while simultaneously putting the left foot down to catch as you shift the weight to the other side. 

-repeat side to side, transferring your weight from foot to foot, always placing the “ball” of the up-foot on the peg and keeping your upper body relaxed. 

This builds muscle memory and confidence because it teaches your body that all you need is one foot to support the bike. It will also get you OUT of the natural habit of holding the bike up with your upper body via the handlebars. You can also do it any time you’re waiting in line during an exercise in the class.

This little practice should help you prevent the vast majority of low-speed drops. The other thing to watch for is ALWAYS STRAIGHTEN THE BARS before you fully stop. Even if you’re slowing during a turn as you get into line, make sure you keep your eyes up at eye level and straighten those bars aggressively in the last second before you fully stop. 

CREDIT WHERE IT’S DUE:
Liza Miller from the Motorcycles and Misfits podcast mentioned this as an exercise she learned from a friend that teaches women-only motorcycle classes. I’m sorry I don’t remember the instructor’s name. I think she’s based in Oregon.

I believe these extra compounds contribute to the foaming capacity of espresso. Not sure though. That’s one of the biggest differences with espresso though: it’s extracted at 8-9 bars of pressure so you end up with a ton of emulsified volatile flavor compounds that you don’t get in regular coffee."

TwoXChromosomes,fdqen57,t1_fdq4t0w,1578664684.0,"In no way am I saying I follow this sub to blindly believe everything I read here. I recognize a blind spot in my perspective and this sub allows me to shine some light on that blind spot. I believe you’re getting downvoted because—though not all posts here should be taken as gospel (just like any sub)—women get ignored and disregarded a shocking amount every day and your comment suggests you may not fully appreciate that. I’m making an assumption there, and I very well may be wrong, but that’s why you’re getting downvoted.

Edit: upon creeping your profile, I’m guessing that people, myself included, are misreading your comment, and that your actual intent was to make sure I wasn’t blindly soaking up everything I read here.

That’s most of what I eat during the school year. They’re pretty much all priced under $3.50 so you can eat three a day for about $10. Personally I love toast so I’d get a thrift store toaster and a big jar of peanut butter for my room. Too with jam or honey and bananas for a healthy start to the day.
