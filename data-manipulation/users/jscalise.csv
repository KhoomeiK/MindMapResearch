HomeImprovement,ffocrr7,t1_ffo3uqa,1580076344.0,"Do you have access to the attic? If so, just go in the attic to the area of the window. You should see a beam or big header above that window. If you don’t have access to the attic, just open the ceiling right near the center of that window in the middle of the wall and/or open the wall right above the window and next to the ceiling. You already made a few holes, whats one or two more. Its very hard to tell if it’s a load bearing wall from where you opened those holes. It needs to be right at the ceiling. A load bearing wall holds up the roof. You’ll know a beam when you see one."

I went to see The Who because of the music I heard on the radio and the albums my sister had and I was beginning to buy. I never expected a laser show seeing The Who. The Allman Brothers, Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Grateful Dead, James Taylor, Elton John and a whole bunch more. I have to admit the only time I went to a show to see an in particular person was to see Wings and a former member of the Beatles. 

I got into The Dead because of the music. It was never the scene. The first Dead shows I saw and heard were in smaller halls. The Fillmore East, The Capitol Theatre, college gyms and other places. After The Dead took their break they came back and started playing stadiums. I still went to stadium shows but a scene was starting to build outside of the music. Selling shit and selling SHIT. Late in the 80’s I will never forget the scene in Giants Stadium parking lot. It was like a dentist convention with so many tanks. I never got into the scene and still went for the music. Did I get high? Sure. 

It was clear to me that the music deteriorated over time mostly due to Garcia’s addictions and the corporatization of The Dead. I just disregarded the scene totally. It helped being in my 30’s and 40’s when all the parking lot issues happened. I usually just went into the venue and waited for the music to begin.  

I never even thought about being in the “culture” of The Dead scene. I liked the music and I didn’t need a culture outside of the music."
