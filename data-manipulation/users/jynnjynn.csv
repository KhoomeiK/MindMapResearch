Maybe a bungee leash would be a better for shock absorption though.     She'd still get the guidance, without the jolting tug."

AussieDoodle,ffls0ul,t1_ffjvhqx,1580043333.0,"Consider getting like a freeze dried food ""topper""

Measure out how much total food he SHOULD be eating a day with his normal kibble + some percentage of the topper.     Then if you must feed him treat (training purposes or whatever) use the freeze dried bits from his daily allotment of food.   He'll still be super excited about it, but you wont be increasing his caloric intake.   If he happens to just LOVE food, regardless of what it is... you can just use his regular kibble as treats if he's not free feeding.      Mine are picky little brats though, they won't fall for that.

of course if you're giving him scraps of YOUR food cause he looked at you with his cute fluffy face...  Stop that :P"

When you sew the patch on, do a reinforcing stitch (maybe try sashiko!) all across the patch and into the original fabric) Then add a metal eyelet to reinforce the hole for the handle.   You can buy eyelet punch kits for like $6 at most craft stores.    Might be worth reinforcing all the handle points with eyelets so you don't have the same problem with the rest later."
