AskReddit,fe589oh,t3_enpz15,1578866515.0,"Was visiting family friends in NC. Asked my friend if he wanted to race scooters down their (very long and very steep) driveway. We race. About halfway down I realize my scooter didn’t have the metal plate on the back used to slow the scooter down. He rides off into the grass and I go full speed into the bump at the end of the driveway where the drain is located. I hit the bump and flip over the scooter. I’m lucky I didn’t bust my head open but then I lifted my arm and it was shaped like an S. I had broken my radius and ulna.

Edit: Forgot to mention..I won. 

Edit 2: Also worth mentioning that it was my left arm and that I’m left handed. School wasn’t fun for those few months."

NASCAR,fdlwuxc,t1_fdlwev4,1578534419.0,"I was at the track earlier that day when it started pouring the rain. We went back to the hotel (25 minutes away) and expected it to be the next day. I’m half asleep when I hear in the tv that it’s going to be run that night. I immediately jumped out of bed, put some clothes on, and sped to the track. We finally get there and everybody is pumped! The final lap comes around and everybody is going nuts because Jr had just won it. Then we see AD flip into the fence and aside from the foam hitting us in the face I first saw his engine completely by itself on the track. Then the next thing we saw was BK slide into AD while he’s upside down. I thought I had just watched a driver get killed. Seeing the pit crew out there with the thumbs up gave me a sign of relief for not just AD but for the sport overall. It is also a testament to the incredible safety of the sport today. Something that is really great for NASCAR."
