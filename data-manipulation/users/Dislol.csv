I highly doubt he just does it because he picked it up outside of work or before he started his apprenticeship, if a journeyman saw you taping devices when it isn't a company or customer policy, you're gonna learn real quick to stop doing it.

Besides, lets be real, if taking a bit of tape off an old device is a struggle or hassle for you, you should probably put your tools down and go reconsider your career choice, because if *that* is a struggle, you probably suck at just about everything else you could be asked to do."

I have a 6 month old, a 3 year old, and a 10 year old, we drive around a lot, I think I know how kids in cars behave, and I'm telling you they aren't gonna notice some porn and give a flying fuck.

On top of all of that, it bothers me even more than taxpayer dollars are being wasted on pursuing charges against a couple of teenagers who put the porn on the billboard in the first place.  You want to lay some charges on some grown ass adults who should have better shit to do with their time?  Have at it.  But some dumbass kids?  Slap them on the wrist and tell them they fucked up, don't go around wasting time and money trying to actually convict them of something."
Michigan,fdtcx7a,t1_fdt6nd9,1578714975.0,"Most kids noses are buried in a tablet these days anyhow, I'm just not buying into the ""Think of the children!"" line.  Kids aren't gonna grow up fucked up because they saw 3 seconds of porn on the side of the highway.

My main issue is the wasting of taxpayer dollars pursuing charges against a couple of teenagers over the whole deal."
Michigan,fdt1qee,t1_fdt0z0w,1578710786.0,"Yeah, its certainly not ideal, but welcome to life, it isn't perfect and you aren't, and never will be, in control of every aspect of it.  Nobody here is saying ""Yeah, play porn on billboards, its fine!"", they're saying there is no good reason to drag a couple of teenagers through the courts and waste a bunch of taxpayer money pursuing a juvenile act.

You don't seem capable of making that distinction though."
Michigan,fdt1ilf,t1_fdt0qwy,1578710707.0,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but your parents likely had to slow down due to the accident involving the motorcyclist, giving you more time to view the situation, and your parents probably had some kind of reaction such as ""Oh thats terrible"", and you were obviously paying attention.

In this case, we're talking about a billboard on the side of a highway where the average commuter is buzzing down at 80+ MPH, I doubt many young kids noticed or cared, or will remember unless their parents had a major reaction."

If *you* overreact, they'll certainly remember *that* for a while.  If they're young enough, distract and deflect, if they're old enough, you need to be mature enough as a parent to have an honest discussion with your kid about sex."

electricians,fdqjdyi,t3_emnacp,1578668113.0,"Just remember if you're talking to any engineers or electricians about their yearly earnings, and the engineer says a lower number than the electrician, it's likely because the electrician worked a lot more OT the engineer.  The engineer also worked from an office and the only time he was in the field wasn't to throw on his toolbelt, but to do a site walkthrough/inspection.

Totally different career paths with totally different schooling/training.  That said, it's pretty nice when you come across an EE who used to be a working journeyman and hasn't just been an engineer his entire career, they tend to have more realistic design choices."

electricians,fdouu1s,t1_fdnyaz0,1578613382.0,"Well its a simple explanation; Because you're wrong!

Cold is love, cold is life.  That said, I refuse to take a dump in those when its below 0 unless its an absolute emergency, and by absolute emergency, I mean for some reason I wasn't able to come up with an excuse to find a real toilet somewhere.  I'll leave a jobsite and hit up a gas station down the road if I need to, and no one on any crew I've been on would blame me, because they all do the same.  Still rather use it in freezing temps over 85+ humid summer days, even here in Michigan."
AdviceAnimals,fdodgji,t1_fdo9685,1578603126.0,"No, not particularly.  I'm just not wrong and lying to myself the way every vegan who claims ""X substitute is actually better tasting than X!"".  Your bacon substitute can be *good* or *great* even, but don't tell me that something is better at tasting like something than the original thing in question."
AdviceAnimals,fdo6wwo,t1_fdnuqag,1578599944.0,It's called being an omnivore and it's what all humans are by default until they grow up and decide to be weird and not eat meat or only eat McDonald's or something.
AdviceAnimals,fdo66fa,t1_fdo1tg5,1578599580.0,"First off, nothing is better at tasting like bacon than real bacon.  Second, eating is already a chore that wastes time, why would I want cooking to be a challenge?  I want to throw shit in a pan, heat it up, and consume it so I can go back to doing more productive shit.  Turns out, non vegan cooking is pretty simple and doesn't waste a ton of my time.  On top of that, I'm cooking for not just myself, but for my family so it better be a crowd pleaser that adults and kids will eat, which vegan dishes are not, since you know, not everyone is a fucking vegan."

pathofexile,fdnrzk2,t1_fdnpe2k,1578591644.0,"You do realize the trade site is literally just a filterable auction house, right?  But instead of an auctioneer, you have to deal with a person who might not be online, AFK, busy in map/delve/lab/whatever, or any number of other things.  Everyone needs alchs, but you bet your ass I'm never listing anything for alchs because it's not valuable enough for me to leave a map for.  Same thing with basically anything under 15-20c, which *feels fucking bad*.  It's terrible design that lower value trades simply aren't worth making because of the time investment if you're busy doing other shit.  I'd like to be able to fill up a tab with random 1-2 alch, 1-5 chaos valued gear, and before I log off for the night, price it all out in a premium tab and not think about it again.  Come back the next day and some items are gone and hey, I have some more alchs and some more chaos, some people got items they wanted, everyone is happy.

Oh, this will change the value of items based on ease of trade vs what we have now?  Boo hoo, I don't care, the economy will adjust to reflect any change GGG makes, this one is no different.

I'm saying this from a lower end player perspective, so don't tell me this gonna hurt casual players because some people will be able to make a fortune.  Guess what, we already have whales and they have absolutely zero effect on me because the shit they deal in is so far out of my price range as to be irrelevant."

What sent me up from ~2200 into the ~3k range on my rig was when I started looking into liquid cooling and ended up with a ridiculous radiator and blocks on my CPU, GPU and RAM, because why the fuck not?  Suddenly I went from a rig that could run anything, but screamed like a banshee under load, to a whisper quiet sleeper that you wouldn't suspect is the beast it really is."

Oddly enough, when I'm trading, I'm usually relieved to see a bit, because it's faster, doesn't bullshit me, and actually trades.

At this point they might as well add an auction house or some sort of trading improvement, because the current player interaction model sucks more often than not."
