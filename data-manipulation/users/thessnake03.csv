Examples would be a 24-ounce bottle of soda or a pint of ice cream. With dual-column labels available, people will be able to easily understand how many calories and nutrients they are getting if they eat or drink the entire package/unit at one time.

I'm assuming the serving size of 1 cup of popcorn remains unchanged, but they'd add the second column for one bag.
