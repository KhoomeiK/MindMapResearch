Awwducational,ffhzsby,t1_ffhzhan,1579960628.0,"Since my major is Ecology I applied and got accepted to the internship through my college, one of my professors keeps in touch with the head bander of the site. People could also volunteer to work at the site as well. So there would be one different registered bander every night, plus 3 volunteers (or two volunteers and 1 intern in my case). You may be able to volunteer at a local banding station. I think they’re only in the eastern and central parts of the US because saw-whets don’t migrate farther west than that (or so we think)."

Each saw-whet, in descending order up on the post is a first year, a second year, and “C” is probably an after first/after second year. You can tell their age by looking at their molt pattern.

Thank you for contacting Microsoft customer service for your lady problems. Just go into her control panel and hold the reset button until you hear the beep. That should help. If that doesn’t work, try plugging in a dual USB cord, one end in her, the other into a Widows-supporting  computer. Try to do a factory reset from the hardware application you got when you received your woman. I’ve also found that giving it a couple good wacks can also help if the hardware is being unruly. She should be back in the kitchen in just a few days!

Good Luck,

Mike"
