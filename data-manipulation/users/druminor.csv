LetsTalkMusic,ff24uho,t3_er7mv0,1579493850.0,"Honestly it probably was just racism.  People back then, even well-meaning people, often had a very naive notion of what Africa and African life was like (they still do honestly.)  Just look at ""Do They Know it's Christmas?"" a song that is explicitly trying to not be racist, but is very racist."

I've seen this exact post about a hundred different things and people over the last few years.  It's childish, and it's boring.  Especially since this is Star Wars.  The new movies are not a cinematic masterpiece, the originals weren't cinematic masterpieces either.  The dialogue is stilted, the twists are hamfisted and uncomfortable, and the ""coolest"" character in the original trilogy does literally nothing but get eaten by a sand vagina."
