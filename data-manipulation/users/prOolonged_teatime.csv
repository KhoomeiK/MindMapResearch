rpg,fe6r1yy,t3_eo04s1,1578901362.0,"Our group started out with a campaign like that. There is gonna be a big event, a world exhibition, in the main city at the end of the campaign. As I am only a player, I don't know what's gonna go down at this exhibition. But I do know that our GM has something planned and let us know who are the main antagonist in the city beforehand. So there is still intrigue but we know it's gonna end at some point! I like it that way :) espacially because we already started another campaign in the same group with another GM out of the group. So there is no scare that we gonna stop playing entirely after this campaign ends!"
