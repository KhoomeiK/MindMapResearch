pokemon,ffvn8ox,t1_ffvc9t0,1580268124.0,This bothers me about Sword more than any before. I feels like every battle through the whole game was a OHKO contest.
diabetes_t1,ffvn1d5,t3_evfo3g,1580267986.0,"Hey wow, I'm 27 and I've been T1 for 19 years! Congratulations on the progress! I had a pretty gnarly DKA last year and leading up to that I was really doing a bad job of taking care of myself, and now I'm on the track to better health too. Thanks for sharing this and good luck to you!"
cats,ffukwme,t3_ev5zfy,1580244117.0,I'm more impressed with the home. I can't remember when I actually saw my floor.

anker,ffszl27,t1_feo8p3p,1580199286.0,"I'll answer this one for you, kinda late too. I wear fairly snug pants at work, and I keep my case in my back pocket. Its not huge. It's also really smooth. It's flung out of my hand a few times when I tried holding it along with other things.  But, being dropped in a Walmart parking lot TWICE has left it with a very minor chip and nothing else. Functions fine. I don't have any personal experience with airpods at all so I can't compare, but I haven't really had any issues with size."
anker,ffsyi3s,t1_fecbd58,1580197848.0,Can confirm I use my OnePlus warp charger for my liberty air 2s.
anker,ffsy9vr,t3_et6qdz,1580197553.0,I just updated and mine are very loud.
anker,ffsy8ua,t3_etstqb,1580197517.0,"I have issues with my right ear with earbuds, but that's because I have a smaller right ear canal. You sleep on your right side? Anyway that's a sign you're pressing the earbuds in too hard. Try a different cushion."

oneplus,ffdeefb,t1_ffd44ss,1579819126.0,"Same, unfortunately. I would love a 120hz screen especially if their supposed new chip can actually smooth lower framerates. But I know this things will have up the price a lot.

Hopefully Asus is getting their act together. I wanted the zenphone 6 but it doesn't work well at all in my area."
oneplus,ffcmhfq,t1_ffcgnr4,1579802589.0,I'll be sold if the 8 pro has a flat screen which it almost definitely won't.
digimon,ffbjtqq,t1_ffam2i6,1579768693.0,"What we need is like... Pokemon but Digimon. Not an MMO, but a large open world Digimon game with multiplayer interaction in the sense of battles/trades. At least in my opinion. Everything you said but not an MMO."

oneplus,ff7c7hm,t1_ff5tis3,1579646146.0,"As someone who's used curved screens for 3 years now, yeah, it isn't just you. Before my OnePlus I had bought an Asus Zenfone 6 and absolutely adored it. But it didn't work well enough in my area (network band compatibility) so I got a phone that would. Now, the 7 pro is an amazing daily driver, but a flat screen would make it perfect. I'd even quit complaining about the auto brightness."

Scout will nibble on my fingers when he's really happy. He doesn't so that to anyone else."

oneplus,ff25w99,t3_eqt46k,1579494687.0,"I say just don't get *any* glass protectors, the curved screen makes them either conflict with a case or dust collects at the edges and it just starts popping and then comes off from a light ding or something. I actually swiped one off, which is ridiculous. I'm going to try a film protector soon."
oneplus,ff258oc,t3_er5c1y,1579494161.0,It probably won't work. Most in-car USB systems only recognize iPhones or USBs with song files. I'd search Google for your specific car model to see.

diabetes_t1,fezm0tm,t3_eqz5cj,1579458846.0,What the other commenter said. I went over a year with no endo and guess what? I almost died. See a professional.

But he still sounds like an ass. Should get serious about having him stop talking about it. You just focus on you and staying healthy. What he does with his diabetes is his own business, it'll catch up to him."
diabetes_t1,fezj80g,t1_fezhcea,1579457911.0,I was hospitalized for a DKA three months ago (been straight-laced since) and I had some pretty knowledgeable caregivers. Until I went to a standard room... I'd have some horror stories if I was in the regular room for more than a day.
diabetes_t1,fewwxjw,t1_feuutov,1579420760.0,"I work in a pharmacy and I've educated my own boss pharmacist a little bit about it. Even when I've been is the hospital, it amazes me how much seems to be off with medical education about these things. Like my pharmacist wasn't aware that Novolog and Humalog take effect at slightly different rates, said they're taught they're exactly the same. Something seemingly little that had been causing me to have massive spikes all the time until I myself became aware and adjusted my meals and such and am now much more in range daily. Not sure if it's the same for everyone, but I take Humalog and it takes effect in 15-20 minutes, whereas Novolog takes effect in about 10."
oneplus,femhlc7,t3_epx43w,1579255948.0,Honestly I doubt the difference will matter unless you plan on running 8 heavy apps and a couple games all at once. I have the 6gb and I've been more than happy as a mobile gamer with it. As for several years... Hard to say. Having a phone for 2-3 years isn't common anymore.
oneplus,femhehp,t1_femdyrx,1579255658.0,"Get a container. Put some rice in it. Stuff phone halfway in so it's completely submerged in the rice. Wait. Should be nice and dehydrated after a while.

Edit: Somehow I glazed over the rice part of your post the first time I read it... Sorry. Though more attempts probably wouldn't hurt."
