funny,ff4tfxi,t1_ff4symb,1579572029.0,"my point about how drinking is too normalized? which makes it dangerous? weird but aight, despite how people like so called wine moms talk about needing a drink after dealing with their kid for a bit. it’s not a good mentality for the mom and even if it was a joke it hurts the kids as well in the future.

and drinking still isnt good for you, but its so profitable that it’s not banned from having ads like cigarettes are despite the fact that they are both addictive and consuming them too much for long periods of time can and usually do end in death or serious medical conditions. calling me a loser wont change these, it really just paints you guys as people who cant go without needing to be drunk to have fun when a ton of people do it."
funny,ff4ro7d,t1_ff4r3gr,1579570810.0,cool it really doesn’t matter bc this isnt a stereotypical high school but aight guess its more important to dislike someone who dislikes parties than to focus on my actual point

funny,ff4p3uy,t1_ff4op86,1579569042.0,"didnt contradict myself. what people think how parties can be fun isnt how parties will be. thinking it isnt the same as the reality. my claim was also that there was too much of a normalization of alcoholism, not parties. i also listed wine moms, which do exist, and do normalize drinking more than they should while also raising a kid. people just pointed out parties i guess because parties where all people do is get drunk and do random stuff is more pressing and important than moms saying how they need a drink after their kid needs a basic necessity"

AmItheAsshole,fez9ymy,t1_fez9nvy,1579455177.0,well family shouldn’t have unreasonable exceptions with things that cost thousands of dollars. it doesn’t make sense not to charge them less than what something is worth

AmItheAsshole,fez8snc,t1_fez8hny,1579454904.0,you have yet to explain how an apology helps more than money
AmItheAsshole,fez8jav,t1_fez7gj4,1579454820.0,[right here](https://imgur.com/a/fXvEk23)
AmItheAsshole,fez7ya3,t1_fez6lh9,1579454624.0,"yeah. if a family member “accidentally” stole your things you wouldn’t just laugh it off and let it happen. i used to have a cousin that stole our things and would deny it again and again. We got more observant and kept catching him with our things. he would say “no i came with this, it’s mine!” and his parents would back him up. We knew he didn’t come with it and so we’d take it back. He stopped when his parents couldn’t back him up anymore and then his parents just bought him more stuff"
AmItheAsshole,fez6sis,t1_fez5ua0,1579454383.0,"you heavily implied that OP was selfish for wanting money from wasted materials and work and when someone points out your flawed ideas on money you back out immediately. i didn’t call you a moron or anything, which would have been unreasonable and picking a fight"
AmItheAsshole,fez65hx,t1_fez445o,1579454178.0,"it was locked and the other entrance could only be found if you really wanted to find it. also, kids aren’t drunk adults. 9 year olds know what’s right and wrong and this kid definitely knew what he was doing. he doesn’t get an excuse."
AmItheAsshole,fez5z2e,t1_feyyppi,1579454119.0,also you pulled the family card which is idiotic. People shouldn’t have to make ridiculous exceptions for family especially when one wasn’t invited and the other brought them along anyways. the work is worth thousands of dollars and the majority of the charges were from the paint supplies which the 9 year old poured out and wasted. 9 year olds aren’t unaware of what they’re doing. it’s no accident either that the kid saw a locked door with a do not enter sign and went out of his way to find another entrance.
AmItheAsshole,fez52o0,t1_feyr9ds,1579453938.0,"the work is worth 6500, and the majority of the cost is from the expensive paints that the NINE YEAR OLD kid decided to take out of their bottles and spread them all over. Nine year olds know exactly what they’re doing. The paints are worth 1500 alone the rest is the time and effort that was put in. It’s also OP’s income. Their JOB. If they broke something they’d be held accountable and charged. 

It’s not a “mistake”. Nine year olds don’t make these “mistakes” especially not when there’s a locked door saying “DO NOT ENTER” and then the kid goes out of his way to find another entrance and get in that way. 9 year olds know right from wrong, they aren’t mindless babies."
AmItheAsshole,fez49qd,t1_feyoz4x,1579453690.0,"you’re telling me if someone broke a window in your house and spread the broken glass all over, an apology would be enough?

or if you worked on something worth a lot of money for days and hours and it needed to be completed in a certain time and someone went out of their way to get to it and destroy it, an apology would make everything okay? 

also yeah, money makes people feel better because people can’t live without money, especially when something of high monetary value is destroyed. you don’t go to an art museum and destroy something completely and then hit them with “but money wont make you feel better!” and expect it to work."
AmItheAsshole,fez2i2p,t1_feyztn8,1579453242.0,AND OP is charging for mainly the ruined supplies which are expensive acrylics that have been drained from their packaging (and i think a brush but mainly wasted expensive paint)
AmItheAsshole,fez26r8,t1_feyljgn,1579453150.0,"kid is 9 and knows right from wrong. also he’s not supposed to be there. adults know not to enter a room with a sign that says “DO NOT ENTER” and kids know as well. the kid’s not a moron, and he went out of his way to get there and ruin everything. it’s not an asshole move to not lock a door when you only expect adults to come over and the one child to be watched by the one who brought him along"
nothingeverhappens,feyz43s,t1_feyukt5,1579452284.0,"yeah, and all 8 year olds do is talk poop jokes of course they’ll think abt that stuff"
