For reference, most places will sell the tag with the mini-figure, but not all do. Make sure you find out how each ebay member is doing so. Bricklink will usually only sell the tag, and you will have to buy the mini-figure separately. Characters have specific tags. So you will have to buy a Chell specific tag to play as Chell and open the level. The companion cube can be played once saved to a blank tag. The game will prompt you do so so, when needed.

I found it's always a good idea to buy a few extra blank tags. You can always save over them, if needed.
