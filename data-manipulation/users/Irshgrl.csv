tippytaps,ff52b3y,t1_ff4yxsp,1579578301.0,No. I haven’t done Instagram. I’ll check it out.
tippytaps,ff4cei5,t1_ff3ma0f,1579560338.0,He does not have that diagnosis. We were just told he had some oxygen deprivation due his small mom having a long labor with 8 pups and needing an emergency c-section in the end.
tippytaps,ff4c7he,t1_ff3ik28,1579560184.0,He is a great joy to my husband and I. We are both retired and he’s getting lots of attention and love from both of us.
tippytaps,ff3fi3y,t1_ff2klmh,1579540002.0,"He does not have CH, but some neurological issues from a traumatic birth. He has some weakness in his front left leg."
tippytaps,ff3feka,t1_ff35o53,1579539944.0,"He does have some neurological deficits from a traumatic birth, and has some muscle weakness in his left front leg."

AskReddit,fdqybps,t3_emqd57,1578676682.0,Jimmy Dean sausage. I have never been disappointed.  I’ve tried many local brands of similar type sausage and have been disgusted by the amount of fat and gristle in the frying pan. I’ve learned my lesson and will always buy Jimmy Dean sausage for quality and taste.
tippytaps,fd426an,t3_ejq3eh,1578163669.0,She looks like she’s having fun. Watching the video makes me smile. We have a dog with neurological issues too. We named him Eddie Wobbles.
MapPorn,fcyrn96,t3_ejc27r,1578085629.0,I love the feeling of the sequins moving back and forth.
EarthPorn,fbhlrrn,t3_edadks,1576876699.0,It is my favorite place too!
