From my understanding, much of the Jewish population settled in Israel after the holocaust. Did you ever consider moving there after the war? What made you stay in Germany? 

Also, you said that your father is biologically Jewish but you didn’t seem to learn Hebrew until later in life. Did you grow up with any Jewish cultural traditions or have a relationship with the Jewish community? Or do you identify with German culture more?"
IAmA,fcvxy1n,t1_fcvuzka,1578012633.0,Me too. My grandfather was an American soldier in the war and he told me that his troop of scouts had captured a Nazi soldier who had killed one of his men (he was a sergeant). He described how he wanted nothing but to beat him and kick him down the hill they were on for murdering his friend.

Honestly, this is sexist of me but I always read posts assuming male gender on reddit for some reason. At first I was leaning towards “eh maybe you could have handled it better with a straight ‘no I need to work’ rather than going into pay rates and stuff” but when I read the RESPONSE you got from your fam i reversed HARD on that.

As I said, I was sexist for assuming your gender but I got MAJOR evil sexist vibes from the husband and wife. It sounds like they EXPECTED you to jump for joy (because you are younger and a woman) at being offered the wonderful opportunity of having 3 kids dumped on you for three days. You know, because you’re a woman and “EVERY woman LOVES kids and wants to be a mother.” The husband couldn’t get it through his thick head that your field of work is much more valuable than a job teenagers normally do. It sounds like he doesn’t recognize your intelligence or professional experience whatsoever."

I had these shits as friends in middle school. Hanging out with me or including me was such a burden on them and made me feel like shit and unworthy of ANY friendship. They made me feel like there was something wrong with me and that I was *so lucky* that they even associated with me. I have this memory burned in my head where I had just been in a car accident. I was laying on my living room couch with my arm and leg in casts. My friends mothers came in and chatted with my parents and brought me some sweet balloons and a teddy. As for my “friends”? They hung out together on my porch and couldn’t be bothered to come in to say “hi” or “hey glad you’re alive”.

I’m happy to say that I dropped them from my life right after. I went on to make close knit group of friends in high school who liked me for ME. I could open up to them about ANYTHING and they’d never judge and just supported me. I’m still close with a lot of them. 

Moral of the story: there is nothing wrong with you. Stop letting these shits make you feel like there is. Surround yourself with people who bring you joy and love you for who you truly are. Don’t stand for any two-faced bullshit. Doing this changed my life for the better."
