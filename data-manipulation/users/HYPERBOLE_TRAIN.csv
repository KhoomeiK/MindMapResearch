Otherwise Graveward is the classic fast-farm. Easy to kill and since it’s a small level it loads fast after restarting the level. 

Slaughter Shaft at Konrad’s Hold is probably my favorite. Takes about 15-20 minutes to farm the whole thing but it drops a ton of legendaries. Since you don’t have to keep quitting and restarting the level every couple of minutes it’s actually a ton of fun too."

Fl4k’s new class mod is a bit harder to get but again, worth it. [Here](https://youtu.be/nzeYvvR57iU) is a decent build to put it to good use. 

I have not played Zane or Moze enough lately to recommend a good build but I hear Zane’s “Seeing Dead” mod is very good. 

Additionally, the new DLC is worth the purchase. Lots of fun and lots of new gear. 

Cheers."

borderlands3,ffm8ic0,t1_ffm5xga,1580050334.0,"Enemies are scaled to your level in TVHM and all Mayhem Modes.

I say “most” because once in a while you might see a level 49 drop, although I have not experienced this in months. 

If you have all bosses unlocked in NVHM you can turn on any Mayhem Mode and it will scale all enemies to your level (presumably level 50) and you will get matching drops. 

Hope this helped. I can clarify further if you want."

Side quests definitely help and the bonus is that much of the good story lines are found there. 

Crew challenges are great but I wait to finish the last bits until I’m level 50 with each VH because then your reward is viable in endgame...or at least until you start really caring about anointments."

borderlands3,ff65s3x,t1_ff5zrac,1579619810.0,"Definitely finish the story in TVHM so you can farm all the bosses if they have something you want. 

You should try out MM any time and see how your build holds up. You can always switch back if you’re having trouble. 

Endgame is all about building the strongest VH you can by farming the best gear."
borderlands3,ff65ezj,t1_ff646p4,1579619560.0,"I stay away from M3 because some of the modifiers just aren’t fun for me and I don’t like re-rolling. I’ll run M2 if I’m trying new builds or using Zane (I have not made a great Zane build yet). 

M4 is where I spend most of my time with Fl4k and Amara because it offers the right amount of challenge and I can farm for M4 exclusives + anointments. 

I think if you’re having trouble in M3, try M4. You’ll need a high DPS build but I think it’s slightly easier than M3."
borderlands3,ff3zd2x,t1_ff3nr38,1579552168.0,"I feel you on that. I was super fortunate with the Driver mod and got one with not-great stats within 20 runs. I have farmed Sylestro over 100 times since and have not gotten a second. 

Rakk Pak, on the other hand, took me FOREVER to get. 

I think these are the only two things currently in the game that are worth the grind. They are both absolute game changers. 

Good luck to you. I hope you reach your reward soon."

camping,ff3fxtw,t1_ff3bu96,1579540241.0,"The short, dull knife was definitely not ideal but it didn’t cause the meat to leak. 

My original reply was meant to be a polite tip but I can go into further detail. The bright red center and the large ring of cooked meat is fine the heat pushing the juices towards the center while cooking. If the meat is given time to “rest” for about 20% of the cook time, the juices will travel back into the outer meat and make more of a fade from bark to center. 

Resting makes for a juicier piece of meat and much less juice on the plate. 

As for your comment, a longer sharper knife will make a cleaner slice without the saw marks. But you have to use what you have on hand."
borderlands3,ff34x3o,t3_erckkx,1579533761.0,I would honestly consider [this build](https://youtu.be/sBAe2X8QM_A) and simply don’t run. There is so much DPS that comes with being able to self-DOT with three different elements + an electric Recursion.
borderlands3,ff2v1hz,t1_ff26vwp,1579525268.0,"That was my thought. He’s a one-shot-kill with a recursion plus elemental projector, on M4. The whole loop is faster than Graveward."
borderlands3,ff2u41b,t1_ff261jq,1579524234.0,"My understanding is that class mods have a higher drop rate if you farm with the VH that uses the mod you’re after. I really don’t know if that’s true. 

Before the event I farmed Tink of Cunning ~60 times but no Rakk Pak class mod. I got it in 12 runs yesterday. Of course this means nothing due to RNG but my experience was obviously better during the event."

Second, while I agree that the game needs some more work, BL3 is miles ahead of 2. They addressed a lot of the issues from 2 and brought some fun, new mechanics. Those new mechanics brought new problems in addition to the problems of the new architecture of the game. 

Overall, I’m of the opinion that the current game is a massive success and I’m happy with the work that GB is continuing to put into the game. I’ve logged ~300 hours in BL3 and it has been loads of fun...and sometimes frustrating.
