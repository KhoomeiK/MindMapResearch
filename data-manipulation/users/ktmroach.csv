Are they getting leftovers from the suppliers that the higher end grocery doesn't need but for a huge discount as they are last in line, then vacuum sealing them and putting a late date so people think they are fresh, they take the chance for the return because it pays off in the end as most people eat them or toss in the trash. 
Vegetables never last, I think I see how they do it now and it's not about the minimal staff, a quarter for the cart and bringing your own bags.
