Economics,fg3ix8s,t1_fg3db36,1580482635.0,"Wages have not been rising with productivity and a lot of share price growth has been the result of labor cost cuts in the form of offshoring. So while a worker might see a single-digit increase in the value of their (small) investment account, that is very much outweighed by the downward pressure put on wages by companies striving to increase share value.

Not so for someone who does not work, or whose wage has never been tied to their own productivity (C-suite), and who has a very large amount invested, and will therefore see a gain equaling multiple workers’ entire salaries."
Economics,fg3csxi,t1_fg3a71j,1580478111.0,"Right, but it’s a lie to say rising markets benefit everyone because everyone has 401ks.

Rising share prices benefit mostly the very wealthy, and do not benefit working people at all."
Economics,fg3cnzc,t1_fg3a1c0,1580478003.0,"Probably the most significant effect of 401ks has been to increase share value for much larger investors, given the fact that the median 401k balance for 60-somethings is woefully short of retirement level."

So you can only argue ordinary people benefit from share price increase if you consider a very narrow set of circumstances, in which share price increases on its own for no reason. Someone with $10k in their 401(k) may experience a net loss if their portfolio increases by 7%. The same is not true for people who have money for a living, AKA investors."

And many of those costs fall directly on working people who have 401ks, like stagnant wages for increasing productivity, or offshoring to save on labor. Others fall on the public at large, like corporate tax cuts spent on buybacks.

If the stock market wasn’t related to the real economy, it wouldn’t be a problem for the wealthy to benefit more. But when we simultaneously force working people to rely on the stock market for their retirement (which is going to fail, going by savings rates), AND loot any potential gains in wages in favor of increasing share value, it’s a highly predatory system."

This creates an incentive to **never** sell property. So as the population increases, the housing stock doesn’t. The corresponding rise in value of the home, coupled with the trivial tax bill, means that people are using CA properties as retirement funds. That is the actual problem. Housing isn’t for living in in California, it’s for investing only. Any place where that becomes the case is in trouble. Look at Toronto and Vancouver. Look at NYC.

Then, because California is populous, and because of the aforementioned sprawl and housing crisis, the state and its localities have a lot of need for funding. But of course they can’t collect via property taxes, so they need to jack up prices everywhere else.

Then, because rent is so insane and the cost of doing business is so high, everything else in California gets much more expensive as businesses struggle to stay afloat and workers demand higher and higher wages just to survive.
