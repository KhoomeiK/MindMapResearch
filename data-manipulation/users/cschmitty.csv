australia,ffek6af,t1_ffegu84,1579851415.0,While interesting surely they are fringe cases?
todayilearned,ffej8pb,t1_ffeaf0w,1579850260.0,"Because it's a human concept. Animals are neither innocent or... guilty? Unless they develop a higher ability to understand what they do and understand the choices they make, saying they are capable of innocence is like saying why isn't a straight line a square. Because it isn't."
australia,ffef3jx,t1_ffeaio1,1579845615.0,"I actually completely agree. I've actually seriously thought since I was a teen my brain is more wired to be more feminine. I just never really labelled it, I'm a person.

Didn't help my mother randomly told me some children can go either way physically and it's up to the parent. Was she trying to tell me something? Eh lol."

todayilearned,ffecqxo,t1_ffeb6ml,1579843313.0,"I'm not upset if someone chooses to not eat meat. I believe you can put whatever the hell you want in your body. Just don't go spouting it's wrong because they're innocent or in the case of carnivores because ""but we evolved to eat nothing but meat"". I mean if that's what you believe fine, but if you want to pass it on as fact then I'll have a go at ya."
australia,ffebgg9,t1_ffealdt,1579842122.0,"Absolutely, a particular ex of mine comes to mind but you probably don't mean figuratively lol.

Look I get it, I was talking literally and thought sex and gender were the exact same thing, so I saw the argument as being: there are more than two sexes, which is obviously wrong. 

Admittedly the whole gender thing baffles me, or rather it's importance to some. Just treat people with respect, I don't care if your man, woman or anything between (or out!)."
todayilearned,ffeafbt,t1_ffe8mjq,1579841208.0,"

I don't give a shit what you eat, I just get sick of people on either side make asinine assumptions as a means to justify their way.

And your whole post is the definition irony. Cheers for juvenile insults ^_^

And what's up with carni's and vegans needing to bring up their diet every chance they get. No one cares."
xboxone,ffe85pz,t1_ffe7dfd,1579839313.0,"It really did. I cringed at every reply you wrote as if it came from a priest doing a sermon. You come across as someone with very little world experience, maybe you read a few philosophical books and you expect people to act in this enlightened anti capitalist way.

xboxone,ffe7hkn,t1_ffdxs1l,1579838771.0,Don't. You saw an opportunity that affects no one negatively while you benefit. Congrats man.
todayilearned,ffe7df9,t1_ffe2boq,1579838677.0,"They aren't innocent, the concept is foreign to them. Stop humanising animals, you come off as a nut. Then again vegans brain matter shrinks up to 20% over time, it's sure to cause adverse effects."

australia,ffdx3ag,t1_ffdtaiz,1579831082.0,"Yeh I guess there is a difference, so people are one of two sexes, but gender can be whatever they want?

But basically I really don't care what the fuck you want to identify as, be whoever you want."
australia,ffdta4x,t1_ffdru0y,1579828378.0,"Yes downvote me because your feelings disagree with basic anatomy.
