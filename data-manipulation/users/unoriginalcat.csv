Again, depends on the surgery. If a person goes for skin grafts to construct a whole new penis then obviously no, it won't get erect on its own, but depending on your surgeon, it can look very good. However, a lot of people don't know that it's not the only type of bottom surgery for trans men. Since trans people take hormones, testosterone, (much like for boys during puberty) causes a lot of genital growth. It varies from person to person (just like breast growth from estrogen in trans women) but a lot of the time it's enough for the second type of surgery. So they construct a ballsack out of the labia, add some implants, perform urethral lengthening and you end up with a cis looking micropenis. It's sensitive, it gets erect, you can pee out of it, all that fun stuff.

That got a bit long, but my point is that it's definitely possible to be unable to tell. With blockers becoming more common, there's going to be a lot more trans people who go on hormones straight away and don't even go through the wrong puberty."

I specifically made a distinction that there are parents who have kids for the right reasons (although there's few of them, but they do exist) so I can't see many other reasons for getting offended other than fitting the selfish parent description. Extra funny when you consider that the most downvoted comments are usually the ones who want what's best for the kids (in this case to be raised for the right reasons) but don't glorify every single parent for blessing us with their working reproductive system, thus automatically get labeled as child haters."

I swear, so few people have kids for decent reasons, such as wanting to raise an upstanding member of society.

Transfeminine and transmasculine are more specific, referring people that transition into female or male respectively. If you believe that there are two genders, then terms like FtM (female to male), transman and transmasculine pretty much mean the same thing. If you want to make a distinction considering the ""infinite"" genders, a transman would be a person that transitioned to the binary definition of male whereas a transmasculine person transitioned into a nonbinary gender that is more masculine than feminine."

Although after a person has 5 kids or so, that are all taken away by child services for improper care then yeah, I think those ""parents"" should be sterilized.

That's my personal stance on life, other people are free to have kids/breed animals as they see fit, **if** they can fully support the life that they helped create. Bringing life into this world just to make it suffer is disgusting and I don't understand how there's even any debate around it."

You say that you've adopted animals with issues before so clearly you know what adoption means and why it's different from buying a near perfect animal. You're a good person for helping animals from shelters so I don't see why you'd feel the need to mislead people into thinking that you adopted this particular puppy."

As sad as it is, the best outcome in this situation is the seller seeing that dog breeding is not profitable, then dumping the puppies in a shelter and then they can find loving homes. As long as people are willing to pay ridiculous money for subpar breeding just to get a ""purebred"" animals, puppy mills and shitty small scale breeders will keep hurting animals. The only way to win here is to drive them out of business, so ""it's their money, they can do whatever they want"" doesn't really work in this case.

So for example my first cat was found as a tiny kitten in a box on the side of the road, I'd call him a rescue since he wouldn't have survived on his own, whereas my second cat was a year old feral cat that did just fine on his own but also enjoyed human company so we took him in, I'd call that adopting."
