bestoflegaladvice,ffjcnys,t1_ffjapll,1579995496.0,"Regardless, a golden is the most valuable dog just based upon *thinking* it's a golden. 

As a comparison, a pitbull is basically worth nothing. But people are willing to fight tooth and nail, and therefore bid high, to get a golden puppy. Just because it's the kind of dog they want. Looks alone is enough."
bestoflegaladvice,ffhobaw,t1_ffhduf4,1579945140.0,"People want goldens just because they think they're awesome, they don't need a piece of paper for it. It's considered an ideal family dog.

You only need papers if you plan to show or breed."
bestoflegaladvice,ffho78u,t1_ffgv2tc,1579944968.0,"I've heard of this before where a dog ends up at a shelter by mistake and gets spayed, and then the owners decide to not retrieve the dog. So, it seems totally plausible to me that they said or *did* spay the dog purposely to turn off the owner."
bestoflegaladvice,ffhnzth,t1_ffhlz2c,1579944655.0,Might be the same reason some employers put up an ad for a job when they already know who they're going to hire: just to follow some policy or regulation.
TrueOffMyChest,fferl3f,t1_ffee6oj,1579862072.0,"I've never perceived demisexual as an addition to hetero/homo/bisexual, but rather a form of pansexuality, which covers the entire gender gradient. A demisexual won't really care about gender, as the bond is more important."

raisedbynarcissists,ffcx8ei,t3_esqicv,1579809160.0,"You're not alone! This happened to me, too. It was a relief because my mother really made me feel like I was crazy, but I knew I wasn't.

My friend fell in love with my mother and they both joked that my mother was my friend's adopted mother now ðŸ¤® My mother also did the whole thing of being super nice until she got to know you better. 

We had come home after shopping, and our plastic shopping bag was on the floor next to us. My mother comes in and sees the bag and starts *screaming* at us about how we're responsible for destroying the world because we had shopped at Walmart. She did her own screaming speal, running back and forth and slamming doors.

My friend turned to me and immediately apologized for not believing me.

About a year later my friend got into a huge screaming fight with my mother because my mother spoke disrespectfully to her mother."
mildlyinfuriating,ffamw6w,t1_ffakd1c,1579739690.0,"My eyes are super sensitive, so the black on white text of books actually is harsh for me. I like the black on grey of the Kindle, and being able to adjust the font, size, line height, and margins so it's perfectly comfortable."
mildlyinfuriating,ff9n7wu,t1_ff99tyv,1579716528.0,"Wouldn't a Kindle be easier? And smaller?

The way the cover works on my Kindle I can hold it with one hand. I stick my fingers under the band allowing my thumb complete free movement.

If I don't intend to highlight the book, I get it on Kindle. And I'm certainly not going to be highlighting while on transit."
mildlyinfuriating,ff9mdua,t1_ff8kq22,1579716030.0,I used to do that. Now I pre-crease my paperback books before I even read them! It makes it so much easier to have them open.
mildlyinfuriating,ff9m4sl,t1_ff9fazu,1579715882.0,"Living in the post-ebook world has liberated me into highlighting, marking up, and flagging up my books to my heart's content.

And now I feel more bonded to my books. They're now an extension of my brain. I wish I had done this back in college!"
menstrualcups,ff2nfgp,t3_er7qzi,1579514759.0,"Very interesting. I just did two flights with a cup and the scanners didn't point out anything.

The difference is likely configuration settings with the machines.

It will be a cold day in hell if they try to ensure our vaginas are empty in the name of security. There is a limit of how secure we make sure people are."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff2mqfd,t1_fezvfip,1579513677.0,"What you mention is good, but the social aspect is a deal breaker for me.  I would rather be cold and alone outside than deal with any more social drama.

If people left me alone, and I had plenty of access to books and notepads, I'd do alright. But I'd have a real temper control problem if a guard tried to pull a powermove on me."
facepalm,ff2lr4h,t1_ff1xsor,1579512159.0,"The term ""comrade"" is so welcoming. I wish it could become part of our culture! But it's got too much red scare attached to it, unfortunately."
facepalm,ff2ln9g,t1_ff2caye,1579511996.0,"Yes, English uses implied words and is still considered correct grammar.

Did anyone else do those sentence mapping things in English class? Where you broke it down into parts. Sometimes a part was implied and added to the map!

That knowledge never became relevant until Reddit."
facepalm,ff2l6fe,t1_ff279w9,1579511304.0,"I feel like the word ""patient"" is implied in your example statement.

Like ""[Patient:] adjective adjective"" or ""adjective adjective [patient]"".

Even the military example could be considered implied nouns. Like ""male [personnel] bunk there.""

English tends to have random occasions of implied words. So sometimes a sentence may not have something that would be considered grammatically important, but it still works because the missing component is implied.

But when you attempt to insert an implied noun when the word female is used, and only ""woman"" makes sense, then it is a surefire case of bad grammar and offensive.

Female *is* an adjective. It is a descriptor. Using it as a noun is grammatically incorrect."
facepalm,ff2l2zo,t1_ff233eo,1579511162.0,"Yes! This! And we should stick with it.

It sounds so awkward using ""woman"" as an adjective just to avoid the word female. 

Male, female = adjectives

Man, woman = nouns"
Crystals,fesfw3c,t1_fesfcdo,1579364751.0,I leave mine stored in a tube wrapped up in a fluffy cloth.
Crystals,fepyf3m,t1_fepv0fr,1579334595.0,"There is some marring on it that looks more crystal than glass.

However, yeah. OMFG how did a crystal this long survive intact? And affordable.

I also have a crystal wand like this, but mine is only 5"" ðŸ˜† It isn't polished, just a raw pick from the crystal bed."

Showerthoughts,fe75n8o,t1_fe64zmq,1578910373.0,"In Prague I stayed in a hotel without an elevator. I was on the 7th floor, and there were more floors above me! It was absolute hell being the middle of summer and the temps constantly over 100Â°F."
Showerthoughts,fe759rw,t1_fe67yen,1578910222.0,"Ugh, my apartment building is numbered like this, and it confuses everyone! The elevator says G, 1, 2, 3. And then there are no other floor number indicators around the building. I live on the third floor, but you have to press ""2"" on the elevator to get to my floor.

Plus the apartment numbering just goes straight through each unit, not using any indicator of what floor the unit is on. (ie, using 100s for first floor, 200s for second, etc). Each floor has a different number of units, too. The unit number doesn't inform anyone what floor it's on.

For awhile I kept telling people ""I'm on the third floor if you use the stairs, and the second floor if you use the elevator."" I finally got fed up and put up signs! In the elevator, I have a sign that says which units are on which floor. Then in the front stairwell I put floor number signs with which units are on that floor. 

Phew. Finally people can navigate the building. Then suddenly, after a nice long period of everything working, people started telling me what a PITA it was to find my unit. Turns out ride sharing apps have started dropping people off at the back door! WTF? It makes no sense. Now I gotta make more signs and put them up on the back stairwell.

The signs are apparently popular enough that when my original elevator sign got all grungy, someone replaced it with a laminated version. They copied it as closely as they could to my original design! I was impressed."

googlehome,fddbgq1,t3_ekk5ym,1578304041.0,"Google home helped me out, too!

I sliced my hand, and needed to hold the skin together with my other hand. So... I'm suddenly handless and at home by myself.

I try to use my phone, but I can't get it to work (I forget why).

I sat there at the table trying to think. Was I going to have to just sit here until my husband came home?

Then I see the Google home. ""Hey Google, call <husband's> mobile."" It helpfully responded, ""Ok! Calling <husband's> mobile.""

Woot! He was able to get someone to come and help me.

Of course, then I had to figure out how to unlock my door with my elbow, but it worked!"

AskReddit,fcjpjb6,t1_fcjlm27,1577698147.0,"One time I was at a restaurant with a group of friends when very quickly I couldn't maintain consciousness. I excused myself and got an Uber home. I slept the whole way there and the driver had to shake me awake.

I don't know much more than that. The entire evening is just quick blurbs of memory. I don't even remember what I was drinking or even if I ate anything.

But it really makes me wonder WTF happened. And if I got drugged. It's not normal to suddenly be utterly incapable of remaining conscious while sitting at a dinner table."
AskReddit,fcjouxu,t1_fcj7g0h,1577697179.0,"I was walking down a crowded sidewalk and got a sense that I should check my purse. I put my hand on my purse and the magnet closure was open. Magnet latches are prone to pop open, right? But I *immediately* spun around and a guy flinched. Wouldn't a guy flinch if a person randomly stopped and spun around? But I blocked him and got in his face staring him down wordlessly. He then gingerly handed me back my wallet."
menstrualcups,fce8rji,t3_eg6ixy,1577618009.0,"I discovered the same thing about myself! My first cup ended up riding up too high and I just don't want to deal with the extra effort to fish it out. I'm trying the Lily cup right now and like it so far, but I've only used it one cycle."
menstrualcups,fcdsmuq,t1_fc9bvo5,1577613288.0,"I found the half diamond fold did the trick for me, and the labia fold may work as well. The pelvic bone appears to be able to help pop open any fold that has the rim exposed rather than tucked under."
menstrualcups,fcds6n4,t3_eh0wez,1577613101.0,"I have three. Two I purchased, and one I got free as part of the customer service. PeachLife will give you cups until you get one you like. Unfortunately, my cervix is too high so I need to use a long cup. The Lily cup worked with some issues this cycle. I'll need more practice before I know for sure that this cup is best for me.

But I have a sneaking suspicion I might catch the ""try different types!"" bug and keep buying more out of curiosity ðŸ˜… I'm trying to resist."
menstrualcups,fcdr5jf,t3_eh1jr3,1577612781.0,"Yup, have the same problem. I just tried the Lily cup this cycle because it is much longer and had zero problems reaching it. I just posted a review with more details on this sub."

politics,fccxbuu,t1_fccwejo,1577603771.0,"I think it's really important to stress the topic of what Clinton lied about. He didn't lie about his administration, or anything that had to do with his position, or his fitness to maintain his position, nor a crime. He lied about the most personal part of our lives that *no one* had any business prying into.

Everyone deserves some degree of privacy, even the president of the United States."
politics,fccw87l,t1_fcct265,1577603392.0,Sticking up for someone who lied about an affair is *much different* than sticking up for someone who is intentionally trying to corrupt our elections... And much much more. There is so much crime going on in the administration that we can't keep track of it all!
Advice,fc7z0ye,t1_fc67q0w,1577522438.0,"I can't cope with gamer rage. A big reason I broke up with someone was over their gamer rage. I knew it wasn't directed at me, but it kept me in a state of fear every time he played.

Rage isn't ever directed at me, actually. But I grew up with it around me. I frequently had to stop everything I was doing and cower in a corner as my mother raged on in a rampage over some random thing.

The rage is just towards a game, I know. But my brain still shuts down and I cower until it is over."
JustNoSO,fc7wo4g,t3_egfnan,1577520606.0,"My husband and I set up a system so it's easy to identify if the dishes are clean or dirty.

When you empty the dishwasher, put soap in it. The closed soap container then indicates the dishwasher is dirty.

Once the washer is done, the soap container lid is automatically flipped open. The open soap container indicates the dishes are clean. If you're just grabbing clean dishes from the washer to use, leave the soap container open so it still indicates the rest of the dishes are clean.

The change in your process is only when the soap is loaded. Always load the soap when you empty the dishwasher, *not* right before you run it."
Advice,fbx4o1w,t1_fbv92n3,1577169206.0,"I won't even read my husband's phone. And it is rare when I ask to use his phone, and I absolutely do not snoop. Privacy is vital thing for people to have.

Your mother is just making excuses for her poor impulse control. She knows it's wrong, but couldn't exert enough self control."
