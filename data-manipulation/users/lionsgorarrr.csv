worldnews,ff4iwfk,t1_ff3m8vf,1579564696.0,"This already happens. Drugs go through different phases of clinical trials, IIRC phase 2 is to prove it's safe, and patients who don't have much to lose CAN participate in these trials. But they don't involve many patients. IIRC phase 3 is to prove it's effective which involves more patients for better statistics, placebo (or comparison with current best treatment) etc. So some very sick patients \*can\* participate in a trial for something that hasn't been proven safe or effective yet.

But if you mean ""why can't everyone who's terminally ill have any proposed drug even if they're not in a clinical trial"" I'd imagine the answer is partly to do with ethics and partly money. If you're terminally ill and want to take some unproven thing just in case it helps, then anyone can put up a ""cure"" and try to sell it to you without doing any science first or convincing any regulators. So now lots of dodgy people will try to prey on the sick; all they need to do is convince someone who's desperate and wants to believe. Who's going to pay for that? Government and insurance won't want to pay for a treatment that probably won't work."

I really just meant most of us only get to live this no-responsibilities lifestyle in our younger days. It's a bit paradoxical as I don't regret taking on more but I do still miss those days!

For me personally it has been worth opting out of some bits on the career front - my job was so busy I was stressed all the time just with that alone. That wasn't worth it. The other optional bits are (for me) worth it."

BlackPeopleTwitter,femm479,t1_femlouo,1579262159.0,"I wasn't really thinking of just wearing stinky clothes. I meant you can spend more to not do laundry, like hire a laundry service or take your clothes to a laundromat that does it for you. Some people actually do have someone else clean their clothes but it isn't the normal practice.

The analogy won't stand up very far because avoiding laundry is all about money wheras cooking and groceries are also about health. I picked it a bit at random. I could also have said you \*can\* get doctors check-ups but you don't \*have\* to. Obviously there are drawbacks to not doing that. And to not doing laundry. The point I was trying to make is there are big drawbacks to not cooking (more expensive, less healthy) and nearly everyone does it (I think?).

I don't think I could have said you don't have to do taxes or pay rent, because the consequences of those things are more immediate."

BlackPeopleTwitter,femlf4b,t1_femfwbg,1579261319.0,"This sounds more like uni-studenting. I mean, you definitely can keep your entire adult life this relaxed if you want to, by taking on a low-stress job and renting somewhere you can afford and just staying in that state forever. It sounds kind of nice. But most people I think have have life goals/desires that break this model. One or more of owning a house, having kids, having a more responsible position in their career etc. Once you start doing that stuff your todo list will change drastically."
australia,fegk113,t1_feggdsd,1579095108.0,"I know this is a side point to this discussion, but you do know right that the current fires are not caused by arson? There has been some arson this year but roughly the same amount as any other year. The vast majority of the fires have been started by lightning. I don't think any of the big blazes are due to arson. There have been fake numbers of arsonists reported on social media (and repeated by certain ministers who should definitely know better) because some parties want to downplay the link between bushfire and climate change."
australia,fegjbor,t1_fedig8r,1579094526.0,"Ha ha ha :(

So firstly to be fair everyone is pretty caught up in the immediate emergency now rather than long-term policy. But some political parties have proposed or even tried to implement (well before this) the same kinds of measures other countries have taken, like carbon pricing, and lots of people think we should advantage of our huge potential for renewables (solar). There are some real programs active at the state level - e.g. I can get a big rebate from my state for installing solar panels on my house.

But. The party currently in power at the national level has always denied climate change is even a thing. Right now they are backflipping a bit and claiming they've ""always"" acknowledged the link between bushfire and climate change. But they also say things like Australia has 1.2% (or whatever it is) of the worlds emissions so we make no difference and shouldn't do anything - apart from the obvious problems with this attitude, this is local emissions and completely ignores our pretty massive coal exports. They are also standing up and saying we are already meeting targets and doing excellently on climate (we are not). This party actually got into power by running a scare campaign against the ""carbon tax"", which was an effort to put a price on carbon to naturally reduce emissions. They recently approved and are financially supporting(!) a huge foreign-owned coal mine which will be the biggest ever in Australia AND will directly pollute the Great Barrier Reef, which apart from being an environmental treasure is one of our biggest economic assets.

So, I frankly do not expect this government to do anything. In fact what I expect them to do is try to spin the bushfires into an excuse for anti-environmental measures like grazing stock in national parks, or massive land clearing. They have already (falsely) claimed that the bushfires are due to unusually large numbers of arsonists.

What Australia is going to have to do though is not just take action to prevent unnecessary extra climate change but also take action to deal with the fact that climate change has already happened. We will have more droughts and bushfires for a long time to come and we just have to deal with it."
australia,fedbx3h,t1_fdv8idp,1579007045.0,"No it's not true. The Greens support hazard reduction burning and other safety measures and always have. One story the right is pushing in Aus is that the Greens have (somehow) prevented hazard reduction burning - this isn't true. There HAS been less hazard reduction burning than we want but this is because of the weather: firies can only do it when the weather is safe and the fire won't get out of control. Since we're getting more hot dry days there are less days that burning can be carried out. So basically this is also a climate change problem.

The story you linked to I don't know - that's about cutting down trees on privately owned land by the looks of it, where the homeowner just decides what needs to go. A bit different to official burning and fire breaks. National environmental law doesn't stop you clearing trees close to your home, only local laws regulate how much of that you can do, and the guy in the story was running into local council regulations. So maybe his local council did have too much regulation? I wouldn't know.

But the Greens being against fire maintenance - no absolutely not.

Also the current fires are apparently so bad that hazard reduction has very little effect. The fires race through the cleared areas anyway. I wonder if his house would have survived this year's fires. 

Btw if it helps when talking to people in the US, of our local institutions, everyone except the politicians are blaming climate change for the fires. The scientists, the fire chiefs. Even our reserve bank (the most conservative institution you can imagine) is trying to convince our government to take climate change seriously because the increased hazards pose a risk to the economy that has to be managed.

australia,fdv3nzb,t1_fduayka,1578742775.0,"There aren't really more arsonists than there are in any other year. The vast majority of the fires are started by lightning strikes.

The cause of the crisis is just hot dry weather, and I guess wind, but I don't know that the wind is anything unusual this year. Also, a build-up of flammable material caused by reduced hazard burning which is also caused by more hot dry weather (fire services can't safely burn off unless the weather is right)."

australia,fdv2km6,t1_fdta5xr,1578742406.0,"I think they're going to have to add an extra one on the right saying ""Blame the Greens"" and/or ""Allow land clearing in National Parks"".

The thing that really pisses me off about them trying to blame the Greens for ""not enough hazard reduction burning"" is not only do the Greens support burning, the real reason for not enough burning is the weather. When it's hot and dry you can't safely conduct burns. And we are having more hot dry days each year. I.e. this is ALSO attributable to climate change. So yes Scott, climate change is ""one factor"" contributing to these bushfires, and the other major contributing factor is climate change."

I used (real) signs with my babies and they did pick some up. But I'm not fluent, and I realised that they probably didn't pick it up as fast as a deaf baby would because I never signed without speaking - but did often speak without signing - and because if they ever ""babbled"" in sign I probably would have failed to recognise it and to respond! Wheras they could make any old spoken sound and I would instinctively talk back to them.

Although one issue I found is, I often had to talk to the baby while holding them. And Australian/UK sign language is mostly two-handed! I have the impression American/French sign is a bit more friendly to one-handed use? I might just be getting that impression from the finger spelling."
australia,fdf5893,t1_fdd68ox,1578353594.0,"Yeah that and, we export tons of coal so the 1.3% only describes our direct emissions and ignores all the carbon we're digging out of the ground and selling to other people to burn.
