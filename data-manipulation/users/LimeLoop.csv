Meditation,fgokllj,t3_ezbh11,1580973596.0,"In Austria, people call this ""starring into the crazy box"". Those.moments you sit and stare into nothing and your thoughts are gone. Mainly kids do it. I did as well and I chased that feeling too. I feel like, practicing mediation with open eyes brought.me back to that state as an adult. It's basically the same feeling as back when I was a kid, with the difference that when it happened as a kid, I actually went into a ""daydream"" in those moments."

Tomorrowland,fg3xlsd,t3_ewmyfz,1580491830.0,"I know, this is a very unpopular opinion, but: Last year was my first Tomorrowland and I had an absolutely fantastic time at Paris' set. I am listening all kinds of stuff online, ever since downloading a single MP3 could take days (Napster und Kazaa if you remember). I am nowhere as knowledgeable as some others here, about EDM, but I would say that I don't have the most mainstream taste. The set I was looking forward to the most was **Alison Wonderland.** Never in a million years would I have thought to have such a great time at Paris' set. Of course I get peoples arguments against her, but what I had to admit after her set was ""she enjoyed it and she made people enjoy it"", true to her reputation, she just put on a great party and awesome music. Personally, I am ok if someone else put all that together. She knows how to put on a show :)"
