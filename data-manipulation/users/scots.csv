I finished one of the top rated Elon biographies last year.  He *is* widely rumored to be somewhat of a controlling dick.  Well, no rumor, there are quotes from his ex wife in it.  They did reconcile as friends a few years later and she is quoted as saying  they do a good job of coparenting and being civil toward each other."

.. Bob Iger - as reported by numerous industry rags with well placed sources - is not renewing her contract when it expires in 2021.

Joaquin Phoenix is an extremely capable actor, but I was never drawn into the character.   
    

I’d been to New York City in the late 1980s, which was slavishly copied for run down 1980s Gotham.   The adult theaters  in Times Square, street crime, graffiti covered subway cars, trash everywhere.  Income inequality. Yuppie Wall Street guys in thousand dollar suits stepping over homeless people.  The look was copied note for note, not created. 

 
It was a well performed, well directed, well shot, well dressed, expertly edited film that did absolutely nothing for me.  
    

I know a lot of people loved the film, and I’m aware it has been nominated in several Oscar categories.  I can’t put my finger on any one reason the film completely failed to resonate with me. I’m sorry reddit, be gentle."
