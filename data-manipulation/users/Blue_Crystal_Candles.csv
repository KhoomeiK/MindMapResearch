dishonored,fevl531,t1_feuyvhe,1579398715.0,"Delilah  does have the Outsider's mark.   I know she has the quote ""the Outsider marked me long ago"", but I don't remember exactly when she said it.  I think it is the dream sequence before the Royal Conservatory in Dishonored 2."
dishonored,fegsv2v,t3_ep13m9,1579101754.0,"Based on things that are heard (For example, you hear butchers talking about Corvo escaping Coldridge and asking if they could take him) 

It most likely be play the first mission of the main game, then Knife of Dunwall.  

In the Second mission of Brigmore Witches the the Dead Eels talk about missing the Boyle Party (""I can't believe we're missing the Boyle Party. All those nobles dressed in their finery"" (or something like that) and ""Lord Shaw is only going with two Body Guards""   So I think then play the main game up to the Boyle Party then Brigmore Wtiches."

dishonored,fee7alq,t3_eoff6r,1579027873.0,"If you mean the one of Hiram Burrows that one changes rooms based on which of the sisters is the ""target"".  Who is the target is randomly chosen, and the painting of Burrows, the note from Burrows and the skeleton key to Dunwall tower are placed in the target's bedroom as a sign that sister is the target if Corvo decides to snoop upstairs to figure out who it is instead of talking to the guests."

dishonored,fd4zk7t,t3_ejujcz,1578172743.0,"I don't but someone else where I work does.   I saw a guy that had the Mark of the Outsider tattoo on the back of his left hand and the Bioshock 1 chains tattooed on the inside of both wrists.  He was talking to other people and it was the end of my break when I saw the tattoos so I didn't get to talk to him. 

I'm always amused when I see work emails because the first name of one of my co-workers is Hiram.  He is Hispanic so its pronounced different than it is in the (English version of the game anyway) game, but spelled the same. (Burrows first name is spelled the same.)"

cats,fcgzfbt,t3_eh9d8s,1577645637.0,"It sort of sounds of what mune likes,but I may be wrong. Mine likes scratches on her back at rhe base of her tail. Is that a the same area?"
dishonored,fc4c5r5,t1_fc4brpg,1577412417.0,"He is first seen torturing Corvo in the cut scence befre the player gets control in the first mission. Return to the Tower is the mission that he shows that he has some powers from Granny Rags. (If you fail at stealth he tends to use pull on you.) 

Hes off the main track so it is possible to miss him during the mission."
dishonored,fc4bglw,t3_eg4j0r,1577411854.0,"The texts don't go over who all eight are.  The ones we know are Daud, Deliliah, Corvo and Granny Rags. The Royal Torturer is Granny Rag's apprentice, and gets his powers through his bond with her, much like the Whalers get theirs through the bond with Daud. 

The other four are not named."

I try to stay out of the sun as much as possible, especially in summer when its 100 whatever out ( no, that is not an exageration. Where in live in Southern Arizona tends to be 100 and above during the summer. Its nicer now,  but I keep my hair short and stay inside most of the time)."
actuallychildfree,fbxir9x,t1_fbxinmc,1577189503.0,True.  I have insomnia at times but that is just my own brain chemistry being messed up.  My cat leaves me alone at night.

dishonored,fbxdmx8,t1_fbvpaoj,1577181804.0,"Hitting the bottle by accident with a sleep dart killed two guards by burning them to death in Dishonored 2 for me.  Accidentally hitting a bottle gang member's flaming bottle by his hip with a sleep dart caused it to catch fire and burn him to death.  So they can be unintentionally lethal because of the environment and in my case, bad aim."

I never got banned (as far as I know) and never ran afoul of the mods.  I just didn't like being there any more."
prey,fbc1fl7,t1_fbbedpp,1576713320.0,Yeah it is. I think thats why it was turned down ( or I think it was its been awhile since I played and am at work right now)
