It's just another reason I really hate this current ok boomer nonsense. 

The same generation trying so hard to find acceptance, to be treated fairly, to be taken seriously and whatever else they're complaining about, is going balls to the wall to blame an entirely different generation as a whole for why things are so bad for them right now. 

So while they want more and more titles and pronouns to use and ways to be addressed and less assumptions about who they are to be made, they are 100% fine with grouping a certain set of people together and labeling them all with an insult and treating them like scum. Boomers, cops, even people within some of their own groups and communities like with how even trans people are treated by others in the LGBTQ/whatever else. A generation hell bent on getting rid of racism and intolerance, more rights and understanding for minorities and their communities, more openness and less judgment for who they identify as, is also just as determined to slam labels and acronyms and slander entire generations and groups of hardworking, caring, loving individuals.

If you played/enjoyed the GBA games like Legacy of Goku and Buu's Fury, you'll probably like this. It's the same type of game but in 3D essentially. Travel around, fight monsters who shouldn't be able to even touch you, cheesy and extra dialogue from all sorts of characters, side quests and things to collect, essentially it's just an open world DBZ game. I've been having a blast with it and they've done a decent job of padding things out or changing scenarios just enough that while you still know what's going to happen, there are some surprises and new things to experience along the way.

Almost bought this the other week but it came to Game Pass a couple few days ago and I've been in love with it. It plays similar to something like Diablo but without all the loot. More skill and upgrade based and more focused on telling a story about a family than it is about min and maxing every little stat. A pretty good selection of playable characters and NPCs as well, randomized dungeons help keep things fresh with different puzzles and sidequests to find. Going back home usually gets you new dialogue or advances the story with one or more family members or you just get to see what they're up to or what's on their minds currently."

castlevania,fev05ot,t1_feupt1p,1579391674.0,"I wouldn't mind all the made up bullshit like Godbrand quite so much if they included characters and things that actually happened, like exploring the countryside and the castle itself, or by not shoehorning Alucard into everything. So much for Trevor's actual journey or giving him his much deserved win and kill against Drac. Because this story wasn't supposed to be about or focused on the Belmont's redemption and rise back to power or anything. 

Alucard and friends hang out in the library isn't exactly what I had in mind for where season 2 was going to go. Can't wait to see him get shoved into the Curse of Darkness story and whatever else they feel like changing just because. If they wanted to go this route of blatant Alucard fan service, they should have just started with SotN from the get go. 

Instead of really helping to bring people into the series, the Netflix version is just giving people false hopes and letting them run rampant with (usually bad) ideas for whatever comes next that a lot of the time just isn't possible unless the show is completely changed from the original source material. So many times on this sub or others it's always ""I cant wait to see Alucard"" or stuff like ""can't wait to see Richter next"" or ""man cant wait to see Simon in S3"" or other such bullshit that shows that the majority of people still don't know crap about the series outside of SotN. And the more the show changes things, the more people become misinformed and continue to come up with totally out there scenarios when compared with the original 30+ year old timeline and lore. 

I'm all for this show adding extra content and characters, but not at the expense of changing and removing most of what made Castlevania, Castlevania. Just because the majority of people missed out on the series back when the games were actually being made doesn't mean that the rest of us don't care about the timeline or keeping accuracy and events in order."

Yeah I'm one of those crazy people that doesn't care about portability at all, and would have been just as fine/more so fine with it just being a true stay at home console. It gets to a point with the downgrades and the compromises that it's just like why bother, is it even really still the same game after being chopped and hacked so much?

That's cool so many people have lives where taking a Switch out and about with you all the time is normal, but some of us don't. I've never really been in a position where taking any handheld with me everyday is normal for that matter, outside of back when I was in school and would maybe use it on recess. I'm happy everyone that does get to do this gets to enjoy all their games on the go, but that just isn't something I get much chance to use or benefit from, and certainly isn't why I bought the system in the first place. 

If this is something legit, then cool for those that want to get it on the Switch.

There have been plenty of bigger, fancier, better, and whatever else games that have come out in the last ten years, but there is nothing else I have personally wanted more. This one single game is the one I've wanted and waited on more so than any other to come out this decade. Years and years of no Castlevania, or shitty ports and reboots, or half cocked mobile and arcade games, but no actual new Castlevania game. For almost 3 decades now I have been in love with that series, and for over 20 years now have been in love with what Iga and his team have done with their side of the series. But Castlevania has been all but dead for over a decade now, really only coming back into the spotlight thanks to Smash and Netflix. 

Then the Kickstarter campaign hit and it was on. Iga and his crew were back, and while it wasn't actually Castlevania, it is as close as we are going to get. A lot has changed over the last few years leading up to its release, and not all are things everyone will love. The launch was pretty rough to put it mildly, and there are unfortunately issues no matter which platform you pick the game up on. 

But beyond the technical issues and bugs, a beautiful game is there, a series ready to fully bloom into something more just like Castlevania did before it. Is it an end all be all masterpiece or something that the average gamer is going to really care about or nerd out over? Nah, but that's fine for me. It's a love letter to the fans of SotN, A/DoS, OoE, and Castlevania as a whole. It gave the team a chance to really shine and come up with new characters, environments, music, and more, while not being constrained by Konami or X amount of years of timelines and story to have to follow. 

At some point, hopefully RotN will sort its issues out, the DLC and everything else will release, and hopefully they can take all the good and bad they've learned from this and apply it to a sequel if it ever happens. I won't say it hasn't had any issues or try to pass them off, but I will say that there is a great game there, with the potential to turn into something truly amazing, given more time and more elbow grease from the people involved. 

It was a long, bumpy road to get here, but I am very happy and grateful to have Iga, Ayami, Yamane, and everyone else back and to know that they got their shot to show us what a new ""Castlevania"" would be like. Bloodstained is absolutely my decade defining game, and I really hope that I get to enjoy even more from the Bloodstained universe in the next decade."

They aren't asking for ridiculous amounts of money, or any at all that I can tell. They aren't claiming to be some master artist or anything like that. They just used a kinda gross and icky way to create a unique image of a cat. And it's honestly pretty cool, just a tad gross. But certainly not delusional."

Traditional styled work was never my jam, for drawing or getting tattooed, but it looks great my man. AFI and Katamari pieces were definitely some faves of mine you posted. Would love to see ya do more Castlevania or see ya try out some Berserk stuff. Keep it up and keep stayin inspired!"
StartledCats,fc9k580,t1_fc8pq12,1577553860.0,"Fur real. Even if ya wanna have em on and around the house, fine whatever, everybody's got different rules, but really maybe take em off before petting the cat? 

Like where I work, metal shavings and filers can get caught/stuck in the bottom of my shoes. Sometimes they get stuck in my shirt and poke through into my belly. It doesn't feel too good. I'm sure it probably wouldn't feel too good taking those shoes and rubbing them up and down the cat. 

Not to mention those same shoes are worn into the work/other public restrooms where no matter how hard I try not to, I usually end up stepping in piss at some point. I really bet my cat would love a super rough petting from sharp wire and the added bonus of piss and other germs getting rubbed all over them."
NintendoSwitch,fc93k00,t1_fc92au0,1577546453.0,"Same. My original launch joycons have held up fine. Now the first Pro controller I got on the other hand, that's had drift issues right out of the box, but it's only really noticeable in certain games."
