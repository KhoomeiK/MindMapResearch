badwomensanatomy,ffggyt3,t1_ffgd61o,1579906007.0,"Creepy screenshot guy is a disgusting idiot, but that ""we only lived to 35"" factoid is based on averages that include infant mortality. While we are living longer, and maintaining better health in those later years, if you lived past 15, you could expect to live into your 70's. See [here](https://www.verywellhealth.com/longevity-throughout-history-2224054)

>
That’s life expectancy at birth, a figure dramatically influenced by infant mortality—pegged at the time as high as 30 percent. It does not mean that the average person living in 1200 A.D. died at the age of 35. Rather, for every child that died in infancy, another person might have lived to see their 70th birthday. Early years up to the age of about 15 continued to be perilous, thanks to risks posed by disease, injuries, and accidents. People who survived this hazardous period of life could well make it into old age."
