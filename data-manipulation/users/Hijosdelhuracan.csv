TooAfraidToAsk,ffiig1k,t1_ffhbnyj,1579974632.0,"America is awesome in the sense that it connects the most with basic human needs. What has made the United States a country that people immigrate to is the fact that there are no old preconceptions of society. You have to realize dad especially in Europe and Asia a lot of the lower social classes had no changes of advancement. A lot of countries are ruled by the religious believes and there’s a fair amount of suppression in what individuals can do. In other republics there are no benefits for people especially in lower classes and retirement. This is what makes the United States a good country in comparison to most other countries. The fact that even if we don’t do it, There is still a chance that you can come for my very low social class and work towards improving your social standing and your children’s social standing. And of this there are many examples. But there are countries out there where if you are born into a family of people that made pottery, you end up making pottery. In summary the United States is viewed as a good country because there are possibilities for people to lift their life in the way that they see fit and to progress in life according to their own efforts. Now obviously in these times we are all looking at the bigger picture and it may seem like the system is rigged in a different way."
