starcraft,fgjawnl,t1_fgjais4,1580840368.0,Let's not pretend like this type of behavior has anything to do with trying to win. Nobody is fooled by those kind of claims. This is entirely just petty bm. Nothing else.
web_design,fgj4e3l,t1_fgiogbk,1580836767.0,"Yeah that's a funny one for sure. It can be easily added to a tiny amount of sites. The rest will require massive amounts of design and development work. There's nothing ""easy"" about ADA Compliance."

The world where substance abuse makes even the shitty trashcan you live in seem like a palace. It's an escape from reality."
iamverybadass,fgio3t7,t1_fgio1yj,1580826972.0,Hahahahaha. This is awesome. You're a clown. Bye!

starcraft,fgin1z4,t1_fgimwov,1580826212.0,"As it turns out, not everybody is as terrified of confrontation as you appear to be. Some of us don't need to be angry or upset to call out poor behavior."

iamverybadass,fgil50o,t1_fgigiuc,1580824778.0,This is an important lesson for you. This is how people react when you send these kinds of messages. Stop doing it. You're making yourself look like a clown.

Walked out. 

Does he do this at home? Is his water bill a million dollars? This has to be OCD right?"
skyrim,fgbg2iu,t1_fgamme8,1580661747.0,Yeah I think I'm with you on that. I also play on crazy hard modes these days just to maintain a challenge and there's definitely a strong element of min-maxing and abusing game mechanics required to even survive.
skyrim,fgagwp0,t1_fga7njw,1580651080.0,"Eh it's kind of an exploit. I mean don't get me wrong I've played plenty of games with it, but the game breaking power it gives you is clear and likely unintentional.

I tend to avoid it when doing legitimate play throughs. Do you not?"

As for the ones on the right... Can confirm, those represent a pretty uncomfortable level of dehydration. Headaches, general weakness, feeling shaky, all sorts of stuff. Dude is definitely suffering negative health effects from that. Probably not super serious ones quite yet, but present nonetheless.

Damnthatsinteresting,fg5uthu,t3_eww9o0,1580539770.0,I wonder if there's any correlation with communication skill. I'm definitely the thoughts without words type and can sometimes struggle to explain a connection that I know exists. It's just like a big cloud of stuff that snaps together in to a cohesive thought... And that can be a bit challenging to translate to a linear explanation.
