relationship_advice,ffgpctg,t1_ffgg6wr,1579911669.0,"I have done nothing of the sort. My advice is valid even if OP's sister were to get professional help, which is apparently non-existent to the geography they live in.

Maybe a solid addition to my comment is that OP and their sister should still search for professional help even if it was online etc. but by no means I tried to encourage them to take all responsibility. Taking care of a depressed family member is nothing other than natural."
relationship_advice,ffeusxb,t3_et9b5a,1579866476.0,"Would it matter how she did if she approached you first? If she finds you attractive, even just saying hi would work. If she doesn't find you attractive, the most romantic or clever approach wouldn't work."
relationship_advice,ffeuju7,t3_et97qm,1579866162.0,"Look, I'm not gonna lie, the only person who can heal her is herself but your help would be invaluable in this process. If you are truly the reason she couldn't leave this world, then honor that reason. Talk to her, listen to her, spend time with her, tell her you love her, tell her that she is the best sister in the world. Anything that will show her that you truly care works."
relationship_advice,ffepj4x,t3_et84nf,1579858988.0,"You didn't pressure her to anything, you just wanted clarification which should be granted right away and not after you asked for it.

If she doesn't want to go out with you, she should say so and vice-versa. You should stop worrying and observe her behaviour while you guys are on a date. 

It could be that she is avoiding saying no, it could be that she thought the heart emoji is a clear yes (lol) or it could be that she just behaves awkwardly in these types of situations. Either way, there is only one way to find out."

todayilearned,fdsicja,t1_fdseuu0,1578703305.0,"Buddhism is essentially the Buddha's solution for his discontentment with the world around him. When he saw it worked, he taught others how he freed himself from his suffering. It originally holds no religious beliefs. On the contrary, Buddha insisted that the only reality is here and now and therefore any belief is completely meaningless and should be avoided. Moreover, even identifying yourself as a Buddhist is actually contradictory to the teachings because it makes you cling to them while Buddhism is all about letting go.

That being said, a lot of the Buddhists today pray to Buddha, kill people in the name of Buddhism, cling to their identity as a Buddhist, believe in karma or opening their third eye etc. which are exactly what Buddha warned against. The irony kills me. I have no respect for that kind of people either.

I'm not a Buddhist and I actually don't care about defending it at all but I wanted to tell the truth because it's truly a fascinating philosophy (he makes so much fucking sense especially about the nature of suffering) sullied by morons almost immediately after his death."
todayilearned,fdsf2hh,t3_emw9a7,1578701261.0,That's exactly what Buddha warned about in his teachings. Compassion without wisdom is no compassion.
todayilearned,fdseoky,t1_fdsdkf6,1578700986.0,"Budhism is a very pragmatic philosophy which mainly aims for reducing the suffering rather than saving lives and we have a strong reason to believe bacteria don't feel pain. These guys are pathetic though.

If screaming carrots were a Tool reference I salute you by the way!"
bloodborne,fdof06j,t3_emduc7,1578603867.0,"Whole Yahar'gul during blood moon. The bell ladies respawning everything and those carts filled with amalgams of corpses were bad enough but leaving the gameplay aspect, walking beneath amygdalas watching my every step was probably the most unsettling thing I have ever witnessed in my whole gaming career. Jeez just thinking about it makes me shiver."

todayilearned,fb3sgb5,t1_fb398gc,1576486616.0,"This is the most retarded thing I have seen. Do you really think Hong Kong's population matter at all? Do you think 7 million civilians with arms can invade and overthrow fucking China, just because they have numbers?

This entire article is about how 13.000 coal miners lost hopelessly against a small police force but I guess you don't even have the ability to read properly you illiterate dumbfuck."
