More than anything I was trying to avoid the ""it tastes like soap"" crowd which ""cilantro"" seems to draw out more than ""coriander"". Also, I think ""coriander"" is the more globally accepted name for the herb and the US is more of the outlier with ""cilantro""."

Thai seafood sauce is mainly garlic and Thai chilis ground with a krok (Thai mortar and pestle; so more crushed than chopped). You season with fish sauce, lime juice, and sugar (traditionally palm sugar) to taste. Coriander and white pepper would be fine, I think, but neither is a primary ingredient traditionally."
