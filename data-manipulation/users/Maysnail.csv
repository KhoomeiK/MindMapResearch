She was terrified lol.

On a side note my SO told me that once in my sleep I said: you know when you’re in the pack just running through the streets downtown ? 

Hahahahaha"

namenerds,ffad2ml,t3_esjh4u,1579732693.0,I’m French from Quebec and would pronounce it as the second option if I came across it. But the first option doesn’t sound strange or wrong at all!
relationship_advice,ff5718d,t1_ff56blu,1579582076.0,"Thanks for that it’s very helpful. I don’t think I can just bottle it all up though. I would be lying to myself if I did and eventually blow up. I need a partner. If we have kids and get married I know deep down it will lead to a divorce if he doesn’t step up. He would never go to counseling. 

We spoke about it and he says he will get better but in my head I know that if i don’t see improvement by next week it’s pretty much over. I’ve waited too long and it’s always the same empty promises. He’ll need to be alone to figure chores out on his own and I’ll need to be alone to figure out why I accepted this type of relationship in the first place. 

He did finally quit weed two months ago. So there’s hope that he will become less lazy over time. But I feel very disrespected by his lack of action after being together for so long. 

Thanks again."
relationship_advice,ff55bha,t1_ff540ub,1579580653.0,Thank you that’s very kind.
relationship_advice,ff55a22,t1_ff53vhj,1579580623.0,Hey! I work just as much as him if not more and also do things outside of the house which he doesn’t. Bills are split 50/50. And although we’re fighting daily about it now I usually only bring it up once every two weeks or so. But he never steps up. I don’t care if he doesn’t want to. I don’t want to either but we have to . I’m very giving and don’t ask for anything but the bare minimum which he has never given me. I know he wants to do right by me but he just doesn’t. Im happy things are working out with you and your wife though. I wouldn’t be asking for him to clean if he was the sole provider. But that’s just not the case with us.
relationship_advice,ff54p6i,t1_ff53v87,1579580158.0,Thanks for sharing. Good read. Definitely have some thinking to do...
relationship_advice,ff53xoh,t1_ff534cu,1579579553.0,Thank you. I’m happy things worked out for you guys. I’ll keep you guys posted on what happens.
relationship_advice,ff53rje,t1_ff537us,1579579420.0,Yeah I feel you. His place was clean but only because he cleaned it knowing a girl was coming over and he lived with a clean roommate back then. I’ve brought it up from the very beginning. Don’t know what’s wrong with me I need to face the music.
relationship_advice,ff53k7i,t1_ff535e3,1579579263.0,"Hey! Sorry to hear we’re in the same boat. 
It gets really hard to deal with and they always have an excuse. I was tired, I was depressed, blah blah blah. As if we’re happy 100% of the time. 
But the more they don’t clean the angrier we get. Just feels like such a shame to let a good thing go when things could easily be fixed. 
Just clean up after yourself! At the bare minimum. 
Hope things get better for you."

He was like upset that I  wore shirts with high neck lines. But when you have big tits showing cleavage gets you too many creepy looks and a lot of unwanted attention...  so you adapt quickly if those things make you uncomfortable. Lmfao"
