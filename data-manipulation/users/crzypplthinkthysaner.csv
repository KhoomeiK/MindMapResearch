I don't know and I probably never will because I didn't respond to the text. I knew the person, she was actually a childhood friend and that's why I didn't respond because I didn't want to confirm it. The screenshot was a clear shot of my face though so she knew. I suspect she got it from someone else that found it online. My babysitter was our neighbor who lived with her sister and they were taking care of their elderly mom, she had no experience in babysitting and no business with children. She took the video on one of those Sony flip cameras in the early 2000s and I still remember how she showed me the videos afterwards on her PC. So probably from there, she either shared the video online or someone else found them on her computer."
AskReddit,ffh7clm,t1_ffh4a3n,1579925167.0,"It doesn't even make sense because this is when u/TheAssholethrowaway was a child. I was also a child when I was molested/raped by my babysitter who forced me to perform in front of a camera with bondage ropes and when I was in college, someone sent me a text asking if the kid in the video was me and sent me a screenshot of that video. Had my face, my hands and feet tied, and I'm like a limp brain-dead person doing whatever she asked me all out in the nude and the worst thing about it all is not just the fact that now I know for sure that the video is somewhere out there on the internet, but that in that time of my life, I was blindly willing and going along with the abuse because I didn't realize it was abuse. I even wanted to do it sometimes."

You get very tired and sleepy when you're on your period? Sounds like maybe narcolepsy and my ex-girlfriend also had this same issue because the body has to work harder replenishing nutrients as it sheds blood, so she lapsed unexpectedly into deep sleeps. She became partially paraplegic after a rollover on her way home from work; she was still on her period that day and although she didn't remember if she fell asleep, it seemed like that was the likely cause of the accident."

samsung,ffdvzor,t1_ffbrokc,1579830300.0,"Aluminum VS Steel comparision across phones are arbitrary. It's generally up to people's preference as if you do drop or hit the phone enough to bend the aluminum, it would probably shatter the glass or break internal parts with the steel. Steel is more durable, but does it contribute to the phone's longevity overall in comparision to aluminum? 


The real comparision to consider is the hardness of tempered glass vs scratch resistant vs shatterproof vs proprietary designed glass -- *after all, glass is glass and glass breaks.* ^^^cyborg ^^^eyes ^^^focuses ^^^on ^^^you ^^^and ^^^snaps ^^^his ^^^fingers."

More specifically, I have the Sophos Intercept X scanning apps and downloads on my phone and Sophos notified me that ""Module Metadata"" was clean. When I searched for it on settings, it seems like it's an app but I can't open it. The notification was random, I just had my phone home screen open. 

My phone is the Note 10+.
