justneckbeardthings,ffcheqb,t1_ffc9m2b,1579799515.0,"Maybe the article means deodorant that isn't an antitransperant

Personally I use non odorous antitransperant and sometimes perfume

I even got myself an extra strong one from the pharmacy (they mixed it for me), and apparently I got the strongest dose possible before the aluminium salt thing flakes out of solution. Definitely not suitable for armpits but during dancing lessons my hands were dry as could be which definitely removed one point of worry"

worldnews,ffa0jjg,t1_ff9mu0e,1579725433.0,"English is not my first language and there might be further differences in professional vocabular, but the word we use in german is ""klar"" which is the direct translation of ""clear"""
worldnews,ffa07fg,t1_ff9k0lj,1579725237.0,"So I should probably mention, I live in germany where we have a bottle deposit system and I work for a company that is currently installing one of those erema machines and we also have a ""production line"" that sorts, cuts, washes, sorts again and dries PET bottles to such a degree that we can supply our own base material for the pellet line

The material we receive usually is quite clean in the material sense (no actual garbage just containers) and we only have to sort out cans and bottle tops(quite easy), clean the fluids and glues off the material (basic chemistry but can be messy), and sometimes we have to deal with annoying stuff like plastic foil wrapped bottles which are a pain to sort.

Since the OP was about bottles I hadn't really thought about other plastics but now that you mention it, we actually have taken a stance against the way plastics are used for packaging. For instance when you buy meat in one of those foam saucer type things that are covered in clear plastic, you can have up to four different plastics in that simple packaging (saucer, cushiony insert thing, multi material clear wrap), and those can't be seperated in any sensible way so they are usually thermally ulitized (nice phrasing for burned for energy)

We are also kinda against colored PET bottles as theoretically you can recycle rPET basically infinitely as long as it remains clear. Colored PET is not seperated by colour (except some shades of blue remain in clear) and is instead removed from the otherwise closed cycle."

worldnews,ff8m6kh,t1_ff8gccm,1579685394.0,"That was the case, to some degree, u till recently 

The issue actually is two fold. One you have color contamination, so you cant create a clear bottle from material where mountain dew bottles etc are present as well. For the past ~10 or so years machines that can sort pet flakes by color have been used, so that aspect has been lessened. They only sort clear and not clear though, so you have clear stuff for new bottles and colored stuff for down cycling.

Then there is a chemical degradation which can be reversed as well,  but those machines are quite new to the market. AFAIK there are two machines in Europe atm. Both are currently under construction"
worldnews,ff8m0qp,t1_ff8l13b,1579685146.0,"Dont forget that when you do recycle, the glass bottle has more mass and the glass needs way higher temps to be molten again, thus again producing more co2"
worldnews,ff8lwoy,t1_ff8f5m9,1579684972.0,"Just an fyi regarding cokes use of recycling material:

Their standards for material quality are so high, that until very recently there were no recycling systems that could even deliver the quality. The machines that can reach that degree are just now being delivered and started"
worldnews,ff8ltlb,t3_es5ol6,1579684839.0,"The issue isn't plastic bottles, not even single use plastic bottles 

The issue is not having a closed loop system. In germany every plastic bottle has a 25 cent deposit and you barely ever see any plastic bottles laying around. 

Also glass isn't some miracle cure to reduce carbon. When glass bottles get recycled they need way way way more energy than a plastic bottle.

Also due to glass bottles being heavier their transportation cost and emissions are way worse than plastic. Unless the bottle is produced and filled locally, glass will most likely be the worse option."

The trick was that when they were using that pushy thingy to press the bullet into the powder (?), they used a pushy thingy with a magnetic tip.

So they dropped the bullet in, ""pushed"" it, removed it via the magnet, slight of hand it to person being shot.

Add a glass pane between shooter and shootee that will break via the shockwave alone and you have yourself a trick"
