I mean I'm not a white male but I still don't like generalizing statements no matter who they target.

Or if I told a story about how my gf cheated on me and then someone responded with ""Sorry women are cheaters"" wouldn't that also sound kinda bad and generalizing?

This is the only correct thing you've said in your comment."
ShitAmericansSay,fd2h4cx,t1_fd2enfh,1578147136.0,"Again what I commented on is completely irrelevant to what you're saying right now.

I never claimed that what Nazi Germany did was uniquely evil and it is whataboutism because in this argument it's irrelevant what the other countries did because I am specifically commenting on the notion that the Wehrmacht soldiers were just German citizens that were forced to go to war and that they weren't necessary evil.

And how do you know that I don't hold other citizens to the same standard? You're making assumptions about me even though you don't even know me, so check yourself.

What other nations did is irrelevant to my point, but you've still apparently failed to grasp it."
