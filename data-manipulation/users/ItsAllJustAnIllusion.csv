todayilearned,feb3a5r,t1_feantsf,1578955017.0,"I don't ride myself, didn't have any particular corner in mind. One track country lanes is less about speeding outright, and more the false confidence it gives the driver to continue without caution, at whatever speed their going. The beeping isn't used all the time, and even driving down those lanes you often come across other drivers taking blind corners too fast, and not every driver knows or acts quick enough to beep back - its all around a bad practise. Keeping in mind that on some lanes with high banks and arching trees, it doesn't have to be even close to 90° for drivers to need to proceed slowly in case of oncoming traffic, often the case is one will have to reverse to a passing point even on straight sections.

 You can't expect a rider to have a walk along evey time they want/need to ride, as if they're competing it's needed for the health of the horse and rider to go out on hacks. You can't put mirrors on every blind corner in every one track lane, there often are signs warning to look out for horses dotted about these areas. Even where its wide enough for two cars you still run into the risk of spooking the horse and causing an accident you otherwise wouldn't have. I have never seen a child walking down a country lane unaccompanied, but you do often get runners, cyclists, or family's going for a Sunday walk with the dog. Or even two cars that have come to a stop head on just past a blind corner. Car drivers need to just drive at sensible speeds appropriate for the road their on, and not honk their horn in order to feel okay with taking blind corners faster than they should be.

I do like your idea about the app for when self driving cars become previlant, something I look forward too. A good solution to something I hadn't even considered. Although I think we'll see them just drive as fast as they can with being able to stop with the information they have from sensors and cameras, but I definitely think networked self driving cars will be a meaningful technology for them to employ."
todayilearned,feaaojx,t1_fea7x2e,1578946353.0,"Rarely do I find they block them completly, and most the time they'll pull into a driveway or gateway at first chance. Definitely prefer them to cyclists who barely ever pull over and are are somehow the only road users allowed to race on public roads. Which in my mind puts you in the wrong frame of mind to be apart of general traffic, let alone coming across a pack of 30 of em."
todayilearned,feaa2af,t1_fea8vfc,1578946147.0,"Yard being stables and such where you'd keep a horse. Commons being open sandy heathland where you may go to ride your horse on a hack, a casual ride."
todayilearned,fea305g,t1_fe9q7s1,1578943825.0,"Which is a bad idea if, as often is done, someone is riding a horse down a country road to get from yard to commons. Horse rider can't honk back, and car comes speeding round not expecting any other road traific. Also run the risk of spooking the horse into the road, or throwing the rider as the car then carries on around unsuspecting."
ParentsAreFuckingDumb,fcbl7uu,t1_fcbku28,1577588161.0,"Fair enough, thank you for the discussion and all the best!"
ParentsAreFuckingDumb,fcbjcbk,t1_fcbejhr,1577587542.0,"I mean, the subs not about the good parts, or impartially reviewing as if this was a court case. You agree a part of this all was a dumb move, hense it fits.

Absolutely, I didn't touch on the part about being gifted a car. If my car was sold without my involvement, I was paid what it sold for, and there was a brand new lambo on my drive I'd still be pissed, it'd still be dumb of whoever sold my car without my involvement. 

Sure, I brought up every other point I could about the parents being dumb. Because that's what the sub is focused on. The hot topic being what the parents did wrong is becuase that's the purpose and drive of this subreddit, and the content it asks for. People are not touching what they did right as that's not the focus of this subreddit. You don't go to /r/insaneparents and say ""well they did good in feeding you as a baby, what are you complaining about"". They did a good thing in gifting OP another car. This doesn't make the other parts not dumb, or less dumb.

It is not an important detail that they did a good thing when pointing out they did a dumb thing in a space dedicated to sharing people who've done dumb things. It's not saying they're completely and only dumb, that their irredeemable and must now wear a dunce hat for the rest of their days. They did a dumb thing in an instance, they're not only dumb people, that's not what anyone thinks."
ParentsAreFuckingDumb,fcbg4zy,t1_fcawg9j,1577586451.0,"If someone sold your car, that you paid for, after agreeing to involve you with it's sale and then just didn't you wouldn't be upset?

Sure, they made a good decision. One that OP agreed with both here and in their texts. The dumb part comes from telling someone they'll be involved with the sale of their personal property, and then just not involving them, and being supprised that it's jarring. What if OP had things in the car? Had seat covers or floor mats, an after market radio? You don't just sell other people's things for them without involving them becuase you can and then find it supprising that their irked. That's dumb."
ParentsAreFuckingDumb,fcbdcmw,t1_fcb2ono,1577585480.0,"OP is both of these things though? And sure, it's the side that they're upset that drove them to post this in a sub called /r/parentsaredumb. Becuase after being told they'd be included in the event, they were not, and their parents didn't think to drop a text before hand which was easy enough to do after, and were supprised this was upsetting. That was a dumb move. This isn't /r/insaneparents.

'he should be greatful he gets the money'* of the car that he paid money to repair, that he was the primary driver of? No, that's run of the mill base level of how it should be? Would you be kissing the feet of someone who sold your car behind your back, after agreeing to involve you when such comes about but then doesn't, because they gave you the money for the car you've paid fully for that's just been sold? 

Absolutely, technically OP has come out on top in this both practically and financially. They've recognised that in this thread. They recognised that in the text chain. But, it was absolutely a dumb move on their parents part to not consider their child's emotions regarding selling their first car, that they'd agreed to involve them with when it came to selling it, and then just didn't? Becuase they forgot? Dumb parents.

/* just saw that op paid all costs regarding the car, so absolutely should not be greatful for the 'gift' of being paid for the sale of a vehicle they have paid outright."
