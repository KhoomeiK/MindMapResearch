loseit,ff1m829,t3_er101z,1579481495.0,"I'd say as well to just do your best. You'll screw up whatever plan you make, we all do, just get back on your plan and move on. If a birthday or special event comes up plan for eat; eat a little less so you can have a piece of cake later and not feel bad.

Reward yourself along the way! You'll have some fun milestones ahead (first 10 pounds gone, loss of an inch or two in measurements) I recommend celebrating those! I used to reward myself with food, but now when I hit a goal I reward myself with jewelry (pick anything you like, a book, a spa treatment, etc)

Find a way to fit treats in. Love ice cream? Measure out a serving ahead of time and keep track of how that fits into your plan. I eat ice cream and chocolate almost every night, but I measure out and weigh each serving so I know I can have it without fear of weight gain.

Last, this will probably take much longer then you anticipate it will. I'm down 93 pounds....and nearing my 4th year. The first 60 pounds took less then 6 months, the last 33 has taken over 3 years despite staying dedicated. Am I dissuaded? Nope, I'm sticking to my plan, and my plan isn't just to get skinnier, it's to live a very long life without knee pain or trouble breathing.

You CAN do this!"
fatlogic,ff1j390,t3_eqyanm,1579480012.0,"But I thought they claimed it was healthy to be obese? So which is it: They are being turned away from doctors they need to see, or they are so healthy with ""Joyful movement"" that they don't need docs because of their excellent health?

I see both arguements here"

loseit,fe0bh2d,t3_endfmu,1578808706.0,"I'm still reading your post but I had to jump in: I've lost 93 pounds, (I started at 263) and I too have CP ( I use a walker and a wheelchair but can walk...I'm just not very talented at it!)

I'd say takeout has ingredients you can't control, especially salt which makes you retain extra water weight, and your biggest issue I'd bet is portion sizes. Watching my portion sizes has really made up for a multitude of eating choices in my case. Yes i can eat Ben & Jerry's, I just eat a small portion etc.

I started out kinda how your did with buying a food scale and counting calories. I'm sorry to say that for a large percentage of us that is the only way that works to lose weight and keep it off, but at the same time it's empowering. I track my meals with MyFitnessPal and try to stay around 1200 cals....but I don't beat myself up if I go over. Every body has slightly different needs.You CAN do this.

I keep low cal foods like riced cauliflower ( I add lots of spices to it) and load up on protein so I'm not hungry.

The others are right, weight loss is 90% diet, but I did join a gym 7 months ago. It's not great for weight loss but it is great for making my body look and feel better! Plus I like being around so many people who I know are working on their goals too.

Glad you joined us!"
loseit,fdyt4qe,t3_enbmiv,1578783343.0,"I've lost 93 pounds, and I can say this with confidence; Loose skin is so much better then sore ankles and knees and not being able to breathe. SO MUCH BETTER.

Now to an extent it feels like some days I just traded one problem for another, but that's rare.

I rely on my own opinion of my beauty. keep in mind I grew up disabled and part of society has never accepted me, so why would I care that Joe or Judy thinks I look ""Acceptable"" now? They never will accept me anyway.

Most people are kind, and all are fighting their own battles. What you have to decide is what beauty means to you, and be fair to yourself. Is your friend (who will never be a supermodel) but is really kind beautiful to you? Of course she is, so why aren't you as kind to yourself as you are to others?

What also helps me is to find areas of my body I do REALLY think are beautiful and I focus on those and accentuate them when I can. I LOVE my collarbones and shoulders, and my hair is pretty dang awesome.

Yes, my loose skin hangs off me and I have to wear compression gear, but I'll take the trade any day. 

To be honest though I do hope to get some of it removed. It's annoying to roll over and have my skin pinch beneath me, and the flopping around gets in the way. Either way though surgery would be for functionality, I am happier skinnier then I ever was obese"

1200isplenty,fdol7us,t3_embdl7,1578607396.0,"I'd say a good portion of that is water weight. When other people cook (family, chefs) they probably use more salt to make the food more palatable then you would when cooking. I don't think you gained that much back in reality.

I too let myself enjoy the holidays and plan to do so for the rest of my life. I only gained a tiny bit over the holidays but I also watched the amounts I ate because I couldn't control the ingredients.

Just jump back on your plan, stop beating yourself up, and accept there will be fluctations"

loseit,fd7qccc,t3_ek3wo7,1578208440.0,"NO ONE could look sillier at the gym then I do, I'm only in my 40's but use a walker due to disability. I find my own way to lift weights and use the equipment, but I save my true dorkiness for the pool; I use swim fins on my hands and feet, and wear a swim cap that is big ....as such it inflates if there's any extra air in it. I look like a fish mated with a smurf!

You know what? I LOVE going, and if anyone wants to mock me that is their problem, not mine. I am doing my best to live life to the fullest. I've been going for around 7 months now and none of my gym fears ever came true, everyone is either really nice or at least leaves me to do my own thing. No one has mocked me and every fear I had is long gone.

If I can enjoy the gym, anyone can! Find one thing you do well, even just for 5 minutes and have fun, no one started out doing everything perfectly, that's why it's called TRAINING and working out"

loseit,fcyyv54,t1_fcxc0ip,1578090125.0,"You'll feel better, but only you can decide if your looks make you happy. 

It's not about that though. For me I've lost 93 pounds, and what I THOUGHT would be things that would make me happy at the beginning of this aren't actually what brings me joy now. (I still have 40 pounds to go)

\- I love shopping for clothes

\- My husband is amazingly proud of me and brags about my strength now

\- I am stronger then I ever knew I could be

This whole process has taught me how to succeed and how to chart my own course. I don't rely on society to tell me I've done well, I am my own cheerleader. The truth is that weight loss probably won't make life fall into place for you, and success may look different then you think it will...just embrace it.

For me I have a hard time envisioning what comes after I am done. Yes, I'll get some skin surgery so I'm more comfortable, but then what? I'll have hit my goals, no the world won't suddenly bow as I walk past, and life will go on. I've decided to take up some new physical hobbies and learn new skills so I can grow as a person and keep challenging myself, because I get the feeling that without an active work in progress that I'll feel a little empty and want a challenge.

I don't like everything I see in the mirror, there are some changes i love and some I dislike, but weight loss has to be somewhat about looks but also about health. My knees don't hurt anymore, I can breathe, and people are friendlier. No I don't love everything that's come from weight loss, but I am so grateful to be alive and healthier to see what I DO love about life"

loseit,fcmb00w,t3_ehtfd4,1577769153.0,"I second counting calories. I was born with CP and use a walker/wheelchair. So far I have lost 93 pounds and have 40 left to go, so if I can do it YOU CAN TOO.

The easiest thing I did at first was dished up a normal meal, then went back and cut it in half...and I was HONEST with myself and cut it in half. That got me used to smaller portions without giving up foods I loved. Just be honest with yourself. What is a cheat meal, day, or week?  It's not that you are sneaking a treat, it's called a cheat meal not because you are cheating on your diet, but because you are cheating yourself. The occasional treat? Have at it. Two weeks of ""But I've been so good today"" followed by a latte, snickers bar and pasta? That will lead you right back to where you started. 

80% of weight loss is diet, so when you feel ready get a food scale ( about $12-20 on Amazon or Target), and read food labels. Also sign up for My Fitness Pal, (it's free!) it'll help and you can see day to day and meal to meal how you are doing. Good measuring spoons and cup measures are good too. Look at what you usually eat and read the labels and measure out what you normally eat, I bet you'll be surprised by the portion difference

If I can lose 93 pounds while disabled you can too!

As far as workouts I started with 2 pound hand weights and lifted them 20 times 5 days a week...I am now up to 2 hours at the gym 3 days a week...so every little bit does get you to where you want to be! Also swimming is fantastic, but start small. I was so embarrassed to go to the gym but now I love it. For now though just concentrate on eating less.

All this boils down to this: Start small...this IS doable without going crazy. Love yourself enough that you want a future and we are THRILLED to help! Just break this up into baby chunks.  Maybe tomorrow weight out your breakfast. Build on that the next day.

If I can do it ANYONE can"

I did the same and I'm shocked! I spent the holidays with family 2 states away and was sure when I flew home yesterday that my extended diet break would result in 4-6 pounds added. Nope! I gained maybe 6 ounces...lol.
