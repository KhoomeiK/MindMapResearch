introvert,ffatmrk,t3_eskmlg,1579744212.0,"I try to remind myself that 
1) nobody wants to do their presentations either. Most of the time they don’t even care. They’re probably too focused on rehearsing their own presentations in their head cuz they’re just as nervous as you are.
2) think about how hard you worked on the project and that you deserve to pass because you did it despite your anxiety. Not everyone can do that. Eventually they let it get the best of them and drop out as soon as they get the syllabus. So be proud of yourself. 
3) as long as you know you did your best, that’s all that matters.
4) grades don’t define you.
5) people want to know what you know. The best motivation to face your fears is having a purpose, so know that you’re helping everyone (as well as yourself) to do you’re presentation in order to pass the class."

She understood at some point it‘s a waste of energy to spank me when I was young and started just telling me why she was disappointed when I had a bad attitude and habits. 

Kids naturally care about their parents, so her opinions and empathy mattered a lot to me and it was enough to clean up my act whenever I disappointed her. 

Overall, communication is key and if you trust yourself as a parent, your kids will trust you."
