Often when my guides try to get me to check on my counterpart, spiritually or physically, I’d be told or I’d see a vision of their name. Or as soon as I’m waking up, eyes still closed, I’d be shown their name. 

Short story: once I was about to miss something important pertaining to my counterpart, so I was told to check on them. Glad I did because they needed support/love at a heartbreaking time. Maybe there’s something important for you to see. Or it could just be coincidences with their name, cause that definitely happens too."
aww,ffcyq17,t3_essykn,1579810021.0,I swear she just “mwahahaha’d” me.
twinflames,ffcwc92,t3_esrtpr,1579808631.0,"I can’t answer that exactly, since we are all on separate journeys, but I do know that you both might have a similar interest in things. You may even like the opposite to what they like a lot more, e.g. one likes sports, the other has a more liking to art. One twin may work with children for charity, while the other works with homeless or animal life more. 

Remember, you both are masculine and feminine energies, so it’s not that you have to have similar paths, it’s the act of joining the two together. What ever, or however different they may be. That’s inevitably the part of the mission Twin Flames have, working solely before coming together. It’s not based around having the “perfect” relationship, it’s about helping the world, cause as I’ve been told by guides, Twin Flames in Union will help change the environment, world, people, etc.

P.s. And yes, a twin flame can be famous. Believe me."
TwinFlame,ffb53xf,t1_ff9ztjl,1579752032.0,"Oh for sure do so. I was guided to pay close attention to dreams since many messages come in them. I’ve also seen who my counterpart was in them, plus that’s what my guides have told me to do."
TwinFlame,ff90ssx,t3_erzttv,1579701957.0,That’s definitely a sign. I’m sure your guides or God or the universe has a message somewhere. I hope you find it!

twinflames,ff906ax,t3_es6dhz,1579701465.0,"Can I be honest and open? An authentic twin flame(s) are guided and told to let go of the codependency, which is part of what is causing people to mistaken themselves for being part of a twin flame dynamic. I can’t sit here and say someone isn’t a twin flame, but those who are actually walking this journey were TOLD and SHOWN by God or whatever they believe in: the universe, etc. You’ll know you are one. It’s not something as simple as having coincidences with another person. To the core, they’ll know who the person is and would be shown things I honestly can’t say simply because I have been guided by my guides to such information to myself. 

In the end, if you are a twin flame, and you are clinging to your other, then you’ll soon be guided to let go. The journey isn’t about being in a relationship. That’s what people mistaken it to be, it’s a sacred mission God/the universe/ what that individual(s) believes in, was sent here to accomplish. They’ve (I’ve) been shown and are continuously being taught/told, (as I still am), of what they’re (I’m) here for. Don’t believe everything that’s told about twin flames. If you are truly one, you’ll know. And it wouldn’t only be about being with a soul that, no matter what, you’re gonna reconnect with after leaving Earth."

And I believe I did go over downloads in a video. Also, when I receive downloads, I’d either wake right from sleep or get the heads up with a ringing. Then either my guide would notify me of what I need to see or tell me as I’m seeing it. I’d close my eyes when I’m about to get them. Or I’ve actually seen the download while my eyes were open. I don’t know if everyone is different but that’s how I got them. Who knows if it’ll change. For instance, a download would be like a symbol of a bird for me, and guide would tell me what it symbolizes or I’d have to do the research myself. Sometimes it’s been the latter since I’ve been on this journey for almost two years now. 

And they are sort of like visions, accept the visions I get often be like moving images or videos. Sorry for the rant. Hope it helps."

But what do you mean about the sound bite? Are you asking about in the video?"
twinflames,fdq5pjs,t1_fc1hwg9,1578656017.0,"I hear the messages clear when I’m tuned in. Imagine a radio, changing stations require a delicate spin of the dial. Sometimes clairaudiece is like that."
