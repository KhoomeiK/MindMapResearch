bipolar,fef6s32,t1_fef435x,1579049523.0,"An awefulsome moment.

A beautiful term from a mental health podcast called the mental health hour. 

And that’s a perfect situation for it. 

An awful feeling that your hand is bothering you, but also awesome that your allowing your beautiful brain to work."
bipolar,fef6i2o,t1_feewxzi,1579049333.0,I feel exactly that way. I love how you put it; privately proud.
bipolar,feelqtz,t1_feea5x9,1579036317.0,"I feel you. I’m just not ready. I debate with this regularly. On one hand, I’m proud to say I am bipolar and look what can be accomplished and break the stigma. Example: someone at lunch (work) today said their daughters friend got diagnosed with bipolar. The whole table did a collective ‘oooh’. And I sat there. Paralyzed. Didn’t say a word. 

The other hand: it’s no ones fucking business. They also don’t know I’m a sexual assault surviver and a product of two addict parents, in therapy since 2nd grade and have a brother who killed himself. 

So I am a closed off person generally so I feel like disclosing I’m bipolar isn’t fitting for me."
