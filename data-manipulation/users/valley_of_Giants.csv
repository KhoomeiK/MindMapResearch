mildlyinfuriating,feyu4de,t3_eqwqxr,1579450540.0,"Former cemetery Sexton here. One of 3 things going on here. 

1: this cemetery has many funerals and they have to dig to make sure they are ready for the next family. This is some what common in in bigger cemeteries that have a few funerals a day.

2: the service is over but people are still hanging around. This is the most common thing that I ran into. Always give the family their time but when the mortuary packs up and leaves then it's time to get to work. Its It's common courtesy to let the remaining family know that you are about to start running machinery.People may think it's disrespectful and assholeish but the next family must be taking care of.
Some may ask why not dig at night? Because a lot of places have noise ordinances.

3: these guys are truly asshats who just don't give a fuck. I've known guys like this and they are around. Those people piss me off so so very much. They have no business working in death care. I've fired a couple people for starting on a grave before I was able to notify the family of what is going on. 

I'm very sorry for your loss. Death is never easy. I'm not making excuses for these workers I'm just trying to shed a little light on a subject that's not discussed very often."
