It was a weird choice though, because it was inside a mirror image of the main building, and located directly across the road. 

I'm sure in many cases it would have been fine... everyone would just get up, walk across the road, and sit down at the mirror image desk in the other building. Except the buildings were served by the same local power grid, their network connections and telephone services while separate would still be on the same exchanges, if the river burst it banks both buildings would be flooded, if a plane crashed into one the debris would probably set the other on fire etc.

I'm sorry to say we never had need of that hot site while I was there, but I was really hoping to see the same shit hit two identical fans at once."

aww,fel1b8k,t1_feko63m,1579211914.0,"An animal might plausibly survive in a drier depending on what settings it's on. In a washer, almost certainly not.

If it involves any spin cycle (the very very fast one, which sorta wrings out the water from clothes by squashing it into the side of the drum) that's likely to be very dangerous, probably fatal.

Mine has a hot setting, which I'm pretty sure would slow-cook most pets, but the colder one would probably be ok.

gaming,fekya7d,t1_feke8cr,1579210107.0,"While it's tempting to assume it's all a ploy, most often it's just because a studio looks at where the project is and says ""yes, we could basically release it now, but 6 months more work will change it from good to great"". It's really common... sometimes a game in development doesn't really come together as a solid title until close to the original release date; getting another few months at that point gives you a solid foundation to do more, tweaking and polishing, rather than releasing something that's solid but kinda rough.

It could easily represent 10 more metacritic points to do this, and while that should be taken with a grain of salt, has gotta be worth it.

Also, they've almost certainly got a number of fixes and improvements in the pipeline but which aren't robust enough to go in yet, or are not fully tested. It might be stuff that they'd have had to cut to hit the April date on time. Good stuff that adds punch or just makes everything feel that much better to play, but which isn't quite ready to go."
