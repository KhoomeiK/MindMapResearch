This includes findings from larger studies about DNA tests being intentionally manipulated. Some of these DNA tests were used in cases involving death penalties.

There is no such a thing as a conviction without a doubt, it is always beyond reasonable doubt, a threshold I find satisfactory for imprisonment but not for a death sentence.

Beside the obvious aspect of a legal system that will always be flawed and will always make mistakes, no matter how careful we are, which should be enough to disqualify the death sentence as an option, I object to it based on moral principles alone. I can't make, in good faith, a logical argument that doesn't classify the death sentence as cruel and unusual.

I do agree that a small number of people are evil or twisted beyond any hope of redemption or correction, and should be locked away from the rest of society for the rest of their lives, but even those people are products of our society and a modern civilization can't just kill them off, because they are ""monsters"", thinking that this absolves us because now the killer is some sort of abstract entity (a state, a nation, a government). 
I only justify killing in self defense, and that for a Nation means I only justify killing those people who pose a threat to the existence or well being of the Nation itself (for example, a former dictator who could be freed while kept in captivity and put back in power, or think if they captured Bin Laden alive, his mere presence in a jail would have put everyone there at risk, because the chance of his followers trying to free him by attacking the jail was realistic, retaliations, etc).

A me per un prelievo del sangue (per un normale controllo annuale, niente di strano) fatturarono come per - cito testualmente - ""un'operazione cardiovascolare"", circa $2500. Ovviamente io pagai solo il ticket del controllo, tipo boh, $35 mi pare.

Personally, I generally don't like prequels too much, I'd rather see a witcher game that develops some super-secondary character, like for example [Alvin](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Alvin) would be a good new protagonist.  He has ties to the Witcher, ties to several important Secondary Characters, a neat backstory to develop, etc."

That's how it looked to me,  you released the flare toward the end before you were completely stopped, yeah. But I could be wrong: your instructors will let you know for sure and fill you more and more details as you progress. ;) It's okay to not remember everything, the first few jumps are so overwhelming and it's totally possible to get sensory overload. :)

In molti casi, per i ""tipped worker"" una tip allowance contribuisce verso la minimum wage, quindi non e' cosi' scontato arrivare a quelle cifre, anche se si', un Barista in gamba in un cocktail bar frequentato di nyc sicuramente non muore di fame per strada.
Il mio punto e' che se e' per arrivare a fine mese dividendo l'appartamento o sperando nelle tips, probabilmente non ne vale la pena. Certo, lo fanno in tanti e non e' che ci sia niente di male, o disdicevole, anzi. Ma certamente non ti ""godi"" il fatto di vivere a LA o NYC se hai un lavoro minimum wage, e se uno deve andare a sbattere il culo dall'altra parte del mondo per quello, forse e' uno di quei casi dove conviene tutto sommato stare a casa: pensare di andare all'estero a quelle condizioni si' che finisce per ""costare una fucilata""."

It looks like (but I can't say for sure) you released the brakes immediately before touching the ground, and that's what caused your canopy to dive and speed up again, hence why you had to run out the landing just a tiny bit. My guess is that if you held your flare down, you wouldn't have needed to even take one step, but I'm 100% nitpicking, and if your instructors said something different, they were the ones there so they are the ones you should listen to: I'm just chit chatting on the internet while I wait for my PC to finish some work.

E' alto, si', ma gli stipendi sono anche proporzionati. Certo, non mi trasferirei a LA o NYC pensando di sbarcare il lunario facendo il barista da Starbucks, ma se, per dire, uno lavora nella finanza a NYC o nel Software Development a LA, tipicamente problemi a godersi la vita, almeno dal punto di vista economico (senza tirare in ballo altri fattori), non ne ha. Alla fine, il costo che e' davvero fuori di testa in questi posti e' tipicamente l'affitto, quello specie in California puo' essere scoraggiante,  il resto dei costi e' davvero relativamente normale (alto, ma tutto sommato accettabile)."
