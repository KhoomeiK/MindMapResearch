If you achieve something, it does not mean anything if you compare it for someone else. If you say ""okay, I got up early and did a 10 minutes workout, but there are people who get up _earlier_ and do _longer_ workouts"" you will never see your achievements. Instead compare to your past self: "" I did no workout at all in the last year - 10 minutes is quite a big step from that person""."

I am a software developer myself, and I can confirm that on interviews it is actually more importat that you have a nice Github page with updated projects than your degree. There are places definetely where they will hire you (of course firstly as an intern or junior) if they see your effort, because it is a missing thing in many graduated students. You can still easily change your career path and you are on the best track for it.

I also believe that after a few year with your mathematician degree (and with this mindset) you will be the most valuable member of your team. A lot of programmers hate math, or just too lazy for it, but especially with embedded systems your knowledge will be a very big bonus for you. I wouldt be surprised if in a few years the companies that recejted you now would be on their knees to hire you! :)"
selfimprovement,fe7f8c6,t3_enzxuj,1578913817.0,"I suggest you to read about Ikigai: this is basically a Japanese method to categorize hobbies, and find their place in your life. It would actually help you I think to choose which hobbies should fit in your time, which ones you really want to do and it also does not eliminate the possibility for having multiple hobbies.

Also, a more personal note: from these, choose coding. It is the one that can lead you to a good carrier, which is very important - it is the hobbi that you can do 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, and it will leave you enough free time (and create you enough money) to do the other hobbies you enjoy too. If coding is your hobby, you can have a very balanced and secure life."
selfimprovement,fe7dmbu,t3_eo05yr,1578913134.0,"There are two things I'd like to address:

1. You say you don't have energy, and you are always tired.
2. You finish your day at 7, and you definetely don't sleep 24 hours at the weekend.

As others here pionted out, the 1st one can be a health problem: you should make blood check, switch to healthier foods and more exercise. I'm doing half an hour of exercising in the evening (I also finish at 7ish), at home, from a mobile app - so there is no excuse here to do something minimal that can possibly help you have more energy during the day.

The 2nd point is important, because I don't know if you are gaming, Netflixing or using your mobile phone in the remaining time. If after 7 you just log into Facebook or Youtube (or Reddit), and spend hours there, you will have a very hard time finding hobbies. These activities are lazy replacements of creative, creating hobbies, and the feed your brain with so many inputs that a hobbi never can give. Sadly, you will never enjoy cross-stitch or cooking or chess if your brain knows that it could be watching Netflix, which is far more rewarding on the short term.

So I suggest you: 1. Try to change you lifestyle to a healthier/more active one, because you need the energy for a hobby;  2. Cut out cheap entertainments that replace hobbies.

After this, finding a hobbi is exactly as simple as you could imagine: search on Wikipedia for list of hobbies, and try out the ones you are interested in. At this point, your body will naturally react positively if you find something you like, because the tiredness/overloadedness factors are out of the way."
