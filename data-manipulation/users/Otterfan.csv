Foodforthought,ff8bv2s,t3_es74yo,1579672250.0,"I lived in a town with fare-free busses for fifteen years, and my current city is considering making busses fare-free. I ride public transit every work day and most weekend days.

The idea has merit as an anti-poverty program, but it won't reduce carbon emissions or decrease traffic. People avoid the bus because it is inconvenient, not because it is too expensive.  Poor people will ride the bus whether it's free or not. It *should* be free for poor people, but that won't increase ridership.

The way to increase ridership is to [increase the quality and frequency of service](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/10/better-bus-system-public-transit-book-cities-federal-funding/599776/). People who have the option not to ride the bus will continue to not ride the bus as long as the cost of lost time waiting for the bus and riding a slow bus outweighs the cost of driving.

Reducing a $1.70 bus fare to a $0 bus fare is not enough of a saving to convince most people not to drive. Imagine that people value their time at about $.60 minute (the average US salary per work-minute). Unless a person goes completely car-free, riding a no-fare bus to work will only save $5 or $6 per day. A bus trip that takes 10 minutes longer than a car trip destroys those savings. Add the overcrowding of infrequent busses and their unpredictability, and the value proposition of busses—even free busses—disappears.

What we need to do is increase bus frequency. The American standard of three, two, or even one route service per hour will never attract any rider who can afford an alternative. Increase that to ten or more services per hour. Add routes for more direct connections. Make [dedicated bus lanes during rush hour](https://www.curbed.com/2019/10/14/20902256/bus-lane-emissions-climate-change) so the bus commute is guaranteed to be the shortest possible. Make wifi standard on busses.

Unfortunately making busses free doesn't work towards increasing ridership. As a society we need to pay *more* for busses. Eliminating a revenue stream won't accomplish this. Give free ride passes to poor folks, but concentrate on improving service."

jazzguitar,feyzss4,t3_eqmtsp,1579452505.0,"Are you overthinking while improvising? Knowing stuff is great, but when you're actually playing you want to be guided by your ""mind's ear"" rather than your knowledge of harmony. Theory is great for guiding your practice, but it can be paralyzing when you're actually playing.

I learned to improvise on trombone years ago as a kid, and my teacher emphasized getting us playing music from our head even before we knew any real theory.

These are some of the techniques he used. You might already be doing these things, but hopefully you'll find something helpful.

* **Improvise with just a few notes.** 

 Start out with improvising with just one scale degree (e.g. the 3rd). Think about the rhythm and shape of the line. Make sure those single-note lines are coherent musical statements. When you're comfortable improvising one-note lines. Then add a second degree. Then a third. Then maybe three degrees plus the occasional chromatic leading note. Then repeat the whole process with a different three scale degrees.
* **Sing as much as you can.**

 Sing along with your exercises when you play them. Sing along with backing tracks. Sing short phrases (start with two or three notes) and play them back on your guitar. Sing what you hear other musicians play. Sing your own solos over records. It doesn't matter if you can't sing—the idea is just to get the music out of your head and back into your ear.
* **Call and response.**

 Make short (one- or two-bar) phrase, then make a response. Start by singing the response, then go on to playing it. Make multiple responses for the same call. Gradually make the calls and responses longer. You can do this over a blues progression for hours.
* **Elaborate on the melody.**

 Don't solo from the chords, solo from the melody. Play the melody and embellish and elaborate on it. Start with little changes (delay and anticipate notes, arpeggiate held notes, etc) and make bigger changes as you go.
* **Learn with others.**

 Playing over iReal is great (back then we used Aebersold tapes), but learning with other soloists in the room is better. You get ideas from your friends, and you learn that your ideas aren't so bad. It's also more fun, which loosens you up."

jazzguitar,fddr8zp,t3_ektfxg,1578321879.0,"A few reasons why triad pairs work, from simple and concrete to abstract:

* Usually together the triads contain some chord tones and some choice extensions. For example, playing over Bb7sus4 (**Bb** **Eb** **F** **Ab**) with the triad pair of Ab and Bb gives you all the chord tones (**Ab** C **Eb**, and **Bb** D **F**) plus the second and third, which are extensions that sound great over a sus4.

* Often one triad contains more ""tension"" notes while the other contains more ""resolution"" notes. For example, over Ebmaj7 (**Eb** **G** **Bb** **D**), Eb contains ""resolution"" chord tones (**Eb** **G** **Bb**), while F contains ""tension"" non-chord tones (F A C), including that nice #4 for a lydian sound. Alternating between Eb and F triads creates a tension-resolution flow.

* Combining two triad pairs gives you a [hexatonic (6-note) scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexatonic_scale). Scales with fewer choices tend to simple, recognizable melodies. This is why we guitarists love the pentatonic scale so much.

* Triads are a strong sound. Your ear hears triads very well and comes to expect them. Playing two alternating triads creates an easy to follow musical structure.

* Triad pairs over a long chord are simple to play, which makes you play with more confidence. More confident playing sounds better.

I like playing with triad pairs, but there are some things you have to keep in mind. For one thing, like the pentatonic or blues scale, it's very easy to play triad pairs on autopilot over long, extended chords. You need to mindfully create phrases to keep it from sounding like noodling.

Also, triad pairs sometimes sound more ""new age"" than ""jazz"", mostly because they lack chromaticism. You can fix this with passing notes."

Guitar,fcwjz2l,t3_eja65q,1578027691.0,"[CTS](https://guitarelectronics.com/cts-stacked-dual-concentric-audio-pot-250k-500k/) and [Fender](https://guitarelectronics.com/fender-250k-500k-dual-audio-taper-pot-split-shaft/) make 250K/500K audio taper pots specifically designed for coil splitting.

Single coils typically take 250K audio taper pots, while humbuckers take 500K pots. The idea with 250K/500K pots is that you wire the ""single coil"" to the 250K pot and the full humbucker to the 500K pot. 

I don't know if it makes *that* much of a difference from just using a plain 500K or 250K push/pull, but they exist."

I'm honestly curious. I always assumed the people who post pictures of synths were people who just bought their first synth. I assume those people don't care, or rather would be pro-Behringer. I'm interested in your reasoning."
Foodforthought,fcvrcca,t1_fcvimcj,1578008352.0,"College debt is tricky. Expensive American schools are really only worth it if they are: 

* truly elite—Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Penn, Columbia, Stanford, MIT, Cal Tech, Chicago, and maybe Duke or Northwestern (and many of these are near free for students who aren't wealthy)
* elite in a field (Julliard or Curtis, RISD, etc)
* have a truly special program you can't get elsewhere

The typical fancy high-$$$ private school provide very little added benefit over a low-cost state school. They do, however, saddle your kid with a lifetime of debt.
