Paragon _and faith._  If OP doesn't start SR early, he'll fall back.  Early on, SR doesn't look great; it takes a few resets to ""wind up.""  And if you don't do that on your 1st run, you'll be behind for quite some time (until ~TC phase)."
kittensgame,fffe8y7,t1_fek0wqq,1579882044.0,"While 10,000 is the switching point for crafted vs. non-crafted resources, there's another switching point at 2500.  At that point, you get about the same _additional_ amount for both - mostly because you got the best deal on crafted resources before that point and because it takes non-crafted resources another 7500 units to ""catch up.""

But then again, that's not really the point we're looking for, because you're likely to resume play after reset with an inferior crafting industry - one which can't get the same output out of the same package of ingredients.  (This invalidates your point that crafting 16 elu cost you 16k unob, too - but my main point is something else.)  
Let's say you can turn all your unob/alloy into 50 elu before resetting.  After resetting, you might run out of resources before regaining elu capabilities, and even when you do, you'll end up with a lower crafting multiplier.  For crafted resources built from other crafted resources, that's really important (and you accounted for it in your newer post), but for raw resources, it's usually a case of keeping them close to max.

All in all, the one most challenging balance is probably the science/comp/BP branch.  The rest should be comparatively straightforward."

The manual/auto difference is always 1%, and can't increase any more.  (IIRC, it's even lower, 0.99%, but that's a tiny difference.)

In a sense, ""chronosphere"" is like annual interest.  You can get +1.5%, then another +1.5% next year, and so on.  ""Manual apoc"" is more like those bonus programs, where you can get 1% discount if you remember it while checking-out.  The former can get better and better, the latter can save 1% tops.  So, yes, you can get a week's supply for free every other year, but you'd have three times more interest by then and could reinvest the other two thirds, _and_ they're not even mutually exclusive."

The most important aspect for INT growth is Bladeburner; missions seem much more effective than almost everything else. BB skills high enough to overtake gang income and let me dedicate the entire gang to Respect grinding helps buy all augs, and with massive augs, mission success is pretty much pinned at 100%.  With high mission and Midas levels, I can get trillions from Retirement and Bounty Hunter, which is pretty much needed for neuroflux >150 (the other requirement is Respect, which is provided by a gang on high ascension levels permanently set to acts of terrorism).  
So, the SF reqs are: intelligence (DUH!), gang (easy), bitburner, and to get gangs unlocked, singularity.  The latter allows for lots of automation, like aug management, too.  Hack Servers, Sleeves, and Corporations are optional.  Wall Street is just about useless.
