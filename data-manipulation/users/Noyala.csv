Needafriend,fferrbj,t1_ff4bow2,1579862330.0,I hope you do :)
aww,ff6tqf0,t3_ertm0m,1579634693.0,This explains my love for chinchillas...
Needafriend,ff3b5nc,t1_fezucpc,1579537747.0,"I mean, I have no idea if we'll get along but do feel free to message for random smalltalk lol"
travel,fez1akq,t3_equ53w,1579452986.0,This is breathtaking!
aww,feyz8to,t3_eqvyyb,1579452334.0,Look at that face! So sweet! He must be having the time of this life!
Needafriend,feyy62d,t3_eqvedu,1579451898.0,What sort of friends? :) And pretty sure most of the internet is socially awkward...
Needafriend,feyxozh,t3_eqtddz,1579451715.0,"Talking alone won't help 'fix' your mental health. It'll be more of a temporary relief. Try to be patient and find ways to love yourself again. And no, I'm no weird internet guru but your post does scream out for help. If you think casual chats might help though, feel free to message. Life is maybe less terrible when skimmed through by a complete outsider!"
Needafriend,feyvuft,t3_eqs28j,1579451056.0,"What a sweet post :) But whilst it's nice to give, I hope you won't forget that it's ok to take from time to time too! You also deserve the same kind of nurture that you are willing to offer."
NatureIsFuckingLit,feyv3dr,t3_eqvo5o,1579450900.0,I know this bear could eat kill me in a matter of seconds but this is still super adorable...
aww,feqroa6,t3_eqdxd4,1579345230.0,That is so adorable! And you're so talented :)
aww,fepvjl9,t3_eq9wl8,1579332832.0,That is so sweet!
digitalnomad,fenfmul,t3_eq1j3q,1579283655.0,I'd say the Netherlands simply because it has a big expat scene.
FoodPorn,femhdvj,t3_epsija,1579255634.0,That looks mouthwatering!
Needafriend,feks50w,t1_fejsesd,1579206472.0,"Nah, I don't believe that! I'm looking for more people to join me and my friends to play on Discord but I don't know if you have that or would be interested. Anyways, if you ever would like to just have a small chat, you are more than welcome to message me as I love hearing about other people and their experiences :)"
Needafriend,fejd8ec,t3_ep7vju,1579168271.0,"It's hard to make a connection on the interwebs that's really deep and genuine I feel. But it also depends on our personal expectations tbf. I'm more of a casual chatter but I like how you consider yourself a kind person - we need more of that in this world! Feel free to hmu if the loneliness gets to you too much, maybe an outside perspective helps to make the days a bit brighter."
Needafriend,fejacr1,t3_epegmz,1579163978.0,"Wow, you must be an angel to have a job like that. It must be so rewarding! Do you like trivia quizzes by any chance? (Totally off-topic haha). Anyways, feel free to message anytime, Baby Groot rocks!"
Needafriend,feja6j1,t3_ep98f5,1579163731.0,"That's not boring at all, it sounds super creative! If you are up for casual chit chat, feel free to message, at least it'll fill the empty hours ;)"
Needafriend,fej9mao,t3_ep8d8u,1579162951.0,"Totally off-topic but I LOVE garlic bread and you've just reminded me that I should probably have it again soon...

But yeah, sorry about your experiences, sadly the internet is never super wholesome. Personally could not invest the time to be mean like that but I guess that's just me lol."
Needafriend,fej9by1,t1_fehupk4,1579162558.0,Send me your Discord and I'll add you!
aww,fehu1hk,t3_ep2wcr,1579123861.0,This is definitely an aww moment <3

Needafriend,feh9jmm,t3_ekueer,1579111968.0,"Travelling is the best! I hope you get to see all the places you want to see! I got a small casual Discord going on, would love to hear about your experiences in Japan! Or just DM me if you prefer convos on a smaller scale."
Needafriend,feh71o5,t3_ep0htw,1579110490.0,"Sure thing, feel free to inbox me your Discord name :) I'm a very casual chatter though so won't always be around."
Needafriend,feh6srg,t3_ep429u,1579110341.0,Hiya :) Do you have Discord too? Otherwise feel free to dm me here for casual random chats!

Needafriend,fegmybq,t3_eosz3r,1579097604.0,"It's the curse of growing older... back in the olden days, we weren't as isolated and now there's the internet which is a blessing AND a curse at the same time I would say. Feel free to message me anytime if you fancy a chat!"
Needafriend,fee21sq,t1_feaxuj3,1579024767.0,"That's pretty cool! I'm based in Europe so if the time difference does not bother you, feel free to message me!"
Needafriend,fee1tqe,t1_feai9ww,1579024631.0,I sent you a message!

FoodPorn,fedz6zh,t3_eolamx,1579022984.0,You nailed the presentation considering it's your first chicken pot pie. Well done and enjoy :)
laos,feariuz,t3_dzcli3,1578951598.0,"Personally, as someone with Lao roots, I just use ""Lao"" and not just because that's what you say in ... Lao. ""Laotian"" never made much sense to me and is unnecessary, too long of a word. It's not like we say ""Thainese"" either as someone commented before me."
solotravel,feapq0n,t3_eo9hdo,1578951141.0,"You could try turning off the phone altogether or put it in flight mode, I suppose. Map out things in advance, oldschool style? Or you could join guided tours so you have some sort of schedule to help you. 

I'm sorry I can't really offer any valuable advice apart from that, as I'm the complete opposite when I travel."
aww,feanspq,t3_eo5crg,1578950672.0,So adorable!
Needafriend,feagv86,t3_drr3pd,1578948600.0,"Hey there! I've got a small Discord for friendly chats and get togethers, we're all pretty casual. Maybe that could be something for you? :) Let me know."
Needafriend,fea7q46,t3_ei7dzy,1578945343.0,Hello! You sound like a very relaxed person. Where are you from if I may ask? :)
Needafriend,fe9whni,t1_fe9teej,1578942070.0,"Oh nice! France is an interesting choice for sure. I used to study French in high school but never really got to use it... so I forgot pretty much most of it which is a shame. Right now I'm just learning some Dutch and Hungarian vocab so I can say a few words, just for fun!"
Needafriend,fe9sm5s,t1_fe9o9x8,1578941111.0,What languages are you interested in? I always wanted to know at least 10 but that was probably a bit too ambitious haha
Needafriend,fe9ni4a,t1_fe9h4kw,1578939757.0,I will! Massive foodie here! I appreciate almost anything. My dream is to travel the world JUST to feast ;)
Needafriend,fe9hp5c,t3_eo0a03,1578937641.0,"I'm always up for casual chats :) Also, don't pressure yourself so much. Life won't change in an instant. It takes a lot of time and patience to go from a place of struggle to where you think you wanna be. So don't forget to forgive yourself, and don't try to rush."
Needafriend,fe9gvfm,t1_fe9ghyr,1578937448.0,"Gotta admit, I never had tamales but it looks soooo good. And thank you, I appreciate it haha"
Needafriend,fe9em4k,t3_eo0zxx,1578936918.0,"Playing the cello sounds pretty cool! Any favorite recipes you got? I also feel a lot of the horror genre fans are actually terrified of what they're watching which confuses and fascinates me at the same time lol. On another note, feel free to share those imaginary riches you are summoning! #peaceout"
Needafriend,fe9c53w,t1_fe986eq,1578936247.0,"Sometimes it just needs a lot of space and time to clear your head. Maybe you can connect with them again someday, so it's never fully ""over"", especially when it comes to family I think. For now, just try to find your peace and have no regrets."
Needafriend,fe9adog,t3_eo593d,1578935827.0,There's no instant magic cure for that I'm afraid :( But it's good you're reaching out! I hope you find your inner peace soon. Feel free to message if you think it might help.
Needafriend,fe96t6x,t3_eo3ml3,1578934902.0,It's not a bad thing to cut any source of negativitiy or toxicity out of your life. There's only so much we can cope with. So good for you for moving on from that! :)
Needafriend,fe90srd,t3_eo0kuu,1578932939.0,"Try to see it positively: even if out of 100 conversations 99 tend to fizzle out (especially online), at least there's that one that still keeps going. Just gotta try and not give up! Best of luck :)"
