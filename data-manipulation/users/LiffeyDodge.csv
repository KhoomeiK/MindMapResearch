VetTech,ffoc0h0,t3_euadvu,1580076091.0,"I had a guy call because his snake was ""very sick"" and just needed an antibiotic, then something about their kid also being sick.  I told him  we don't see exotics, my doctors are not comfortable seeing snakes.  He got pissed, that we didn't care and we were being greedy.  I tried to explain that the FDA and the vet board requires an exam before prescriptions are issued he still tired to push the point."

VetTech,ff8i3r2,t3_es5llt,1579679501.0,"I received my Bachelors of science in veterinary technology 2005.  the difference ---basically nothing,   the only difference is  associate vs bachelors degree.  I think California allows technologist to do more, but I'm not sure.  I chose the bachelors degree option because out of the 2 programs in my state at the time, the 4 year school had actual dorms and students who stayed on campus at night and on weekends.  The other program, while it teamed up with a vet school for a clinical year, and had dorms, no one stayed on campus on the weekends. I paid a little more in student loans, but I don't regret it."

VetTech,ff59k8t,t1_ff58ncc,1579584349.0,"I think it's safe to say that the medication prescribed is not a date rape drug. the entire point is to have the dog a sleep enough to evaluate without getting bit to hell.    no one in the group can diagnose via a picture.  so, give the meds as prescribed, and take the dog to the vet if you are so worried about it."

dogs,ff2sbmg,t3_erc8qe,1579522003.0,"I did this twice in a year with a beagle who is very nervous.  starting with the obvious, on the day you are moving your big things, put him in a kennel so he won't be under foot.  in the new house, time and routine are key.   and if you are concerned, maybe speak to your vet about some anti-anxiety medications for the move depending on how anxious he his.  I found that once the furniture came, my beagle relaxed quiet a bit."
dogs,ff2rc8z,t3_er764v,1579520647.0,"I wouldn't leave him in there 24/7,  While he is in the kennel, allow the cats an opportunity to check out the new addition.  give him some time explore the house with the cats closed off.  and later have the new dog on a leash while the cats are out.  This way, if he tries to chase the cats he can't get too far.  It will take some time, but if done right, everyone should at least tolerate each other."
dogs,ff2r21f,t3_er5kn5,1579520236.0,"love and time should help.  it can take a few weeks for a dog to get used to a new home and new routine as well.  If she stops eating or otherwise seems to be unwell, have her evaluated by a vet to make sure there isn't something else going on."

Maybe get rid of the possible toxic items?  ASPCA animal poison control and Pet Poison Helpline are two resources based in the US (I'm sure there are many more)  that have information on what should and shouldn't be given to dogs.  both have phone numbers incase of emergency and there is a fee."

AmItheAsshole,ff1c8dw,t3_deyzhm,1579477417.0,"NTA. expecting a person who is either in school or just starting their lives to drop 2k on an elderly ill pet is is unreasonable to me.  It also is unclear if the inappropriate diet is causing the current health issues.  I don't think it is fair to place blame entirely on your mother for that.  One thing to keep in mind,  the prescribed treatment may not work, and if it is successful, the long term care needs to be taken into consideration.  With the dog's co-morbidities, surgery can be just that much harder.  If your parents want to treat the dog, they should pay for it."
