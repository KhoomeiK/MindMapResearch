Anyway, your hypocrisy is prominent since you referred to me defending the good dude as ""mental-gymnastics"" under derogatory context, but I exert less ""mental-gymnastics"" than you would have to in order to completely flip the intentions of a good samiratan. See, your argument entails how this dude who clearly portrays a good deed, is actually a shitty person, which is the exact opposite of what is expressed with the video, but my argument is that he is not a shitty person with ulterior motives of malice which was what was shown through the video. Basically what I'm saying is that it's harder for your argument to be formed than mine. Mental gymnastics. Hypocrite. These are words.

I said ""I don't need to justify shit."" You commenting on this is like saying ""you don't HAVE to have a good argument, so why do you? Idiot!""
I went the extra mile for you. Consider yourself lucky, champ.

I don't need to justify shit. It justified itself by being a good deed that helped someone else. Doesn't matter if it was filmed or not.

There are many albeit questionable ways to attract YouTube views, but this one is definitely the most tolerable. 

If a good deed is committed, but no one is around to see it, did it really happen? How is it unfair for someone to document themselves helping others? Would you have the same criticism over someone posing in front of trash bags after a long day of helping the environment, transitively everyone?"
gifs,fgp2ary,t3_ezpc67,1580994876.0,"People are calling this guy a narcissist for recording himself conducting a positive act. 

Firstly, he was recording prior to the incident, did you expect him to stop filming to press a fucking button?

Additionally, how is it more egotistical to record yourself doing something positive for someone, than intentionally NOT doing something positive for someone at risk of your ego and reputation being tainted? 

It's like all you chumps just want to hate this guy for doing something nice. How DARE someone document themselves having a positive impact on the world! 

And yeah, calling yourself a full-fledged hero might be a bit far fetched, but I bet he's a goddamn hero compared to 90% of you people. You definitely don't need to call him an idiot (which is actually equally narcissistic, which I don't expect any of you ignorant people to notice when you're caught up in your circlejerk)."

That's all it really is. There's no hidden meaning or anything. Would you not agree that boys tend to be more into Darth Vader than girls? Now, I don't want to hear about you knowing personal examples of girls idolising Darth Vader, okay? Because obviously there will be outliers, since it's a generalization.

unpopularopinion,ffsvkot,t3_ev1ggh,1580194196.0,"Let's understand this:

Your opinion states: each person receiving (x/10) currency is less efficient than one person receiving x currency. 

So let's say that one person receives $100, and the remaining 9 people receive $0. This person is, for the sake of argument, out of poverty, whilst the other 9 people are still deep in poverty, without even a small fraction of the $100 to help support them. 

So let's say that $100 can be issued to a child each day. 

After 10 days, the final child receives his money, 9 days after the child who received his money initially. 

What if by the 8th day, the child who was first has already spent his allocated monetary gain of $100? Is it then justifiable for that child to receive an additional $100 in support, whilst a child hasn't even received his first division of monetary support yet? 

Let's say instead, that each day, each child receives $10 (it's the same amount of money after 10 days). 

Child 1-10 receive their money, and they understand that it's a small amount, they don't know if it will be their first or last support, and they understand that they should aim to sustain it for as long as possible. 

Day 2 arrives, and the net support has been $80 up to this point - each child spent a mere $2 as a result of this ambiguity. 

Each day, each child receives a net total of $8, they understand that the amount they they receive is small and requires intelligent fund allocation so as to not run out. 

This continues, and eventually each child is out of poverty. Each child can afford to eat every night, yet they are out of poverty all the same."
