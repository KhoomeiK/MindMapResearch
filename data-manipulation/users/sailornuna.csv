The thing is, the only thing that brings me comfort when I feel nausea is heat. I luckily have a heat pad and portable heater I can just keep nearby.

I have a history of having GERD issues, but never ever had nausea from it. Just tightness in my chest that usually would go away in about 5 hours.

There is a chance I already had the beginning stages of ibs before getting this sick because I had on and off constipation. 

It wasn't until I smoked up one night (biiig bong hit) and started feeling nausea shortly after. I had been a regular smoker for 10ish years and all of a sudden this started happening.

It's when the receptors that block you from nausea with weed use gets unblocked and you end up feeling extremely nauseous because the thc starts binding to the receptors in your gut that cause nausea. 

Many smokers/vapers/edibles eaters have ended up in the ER from constant vomiting because they became so dehydrated. This is a very recent thing.

I had been a regular smoker for 10 years and have SUDDENLY started feeling nauseous after smoking a heavy amount at a time. I have had edibles, took huge bong rips and all that, but had NEVER felt so helpless and sick from it until now. Have not vomited yet, but spent hours in the bathroom sitting next to a portable heater because I could not stop shivering and the nausea kept coming and going. The only thing that fixed this issue was not smoking a very large amount of thc or even just quitting altogether. I've also heard a nice hot bath or shower does wonders when you are feeling nauseous from this.
