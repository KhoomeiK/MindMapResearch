Granted Metallica and Guns were getting back to that pure rocker look, it’s exactly what you describe. I actually remember my band and I who were covering bands like Warrant, Ratt, Skid Row sitting down and listening to Nevermind and not one of us could understand the appeal...there was a lack of shredding? Hard to describe but it was like Nirvana just didn’t give a shit about half hour shred solos.
