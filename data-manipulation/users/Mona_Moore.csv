spirituality,feys4qd,t1_fey3ad1,1579449918.0,"It likely is. There are no coincidences. Anytime you think there is one, stop and give thought to it.  Is it answering a question you had about a direction to take or something you need to do?"
outsourcethat,feyrqxi,t1_feyr248,1579449776.0,"You must have experienced this before.  I keep thinking that. This is going to be a sweet gig. Traveling the country going to festivals and helping people. I know people are going to tell me how lucky I am, but not understand the sacrifices I’m making. The chances I’m taking financially, or see the times Ive screamed, at nothing out pure frustration,  or the bad headaches and body craps from sitting at a computer for so long."
outsourcethat,feyqzap,t1_fey3t02,1579449500.0,"So much. I am so exhausted and work every single day, with at least 5 of the days being 12+ hour days. I keep telling my kids this is temporary. I know I can do it, just getting there is challenging. But I’m persistent as shit.  So I’ll make it."

outsourcethat,fex7wza,t1_fex70cb,1579426486.0,"I have but there are sooo many and each one tells me their the best solution. Which CMR, payment processor, donor software to use, or use software not geared toward non-profits and use traditional marketing campaigns to solicit donations....etc. all while I am trying to learn graphic design to do logos, handle operational issues, state and federal paperwork, a day job and raise my kids. If I some how pull this off, it will be in a memoir, or a story told for decades at family gatherings. The six festivals I’m scheduled for are all three day festivals in 4 states. And I’ve been a solo operation since my “casual idea” in October took off like a wild fire.  I’ve been self-funding, but can’t do so anymore.  I have amazing prizes for a fundraiser I’m trying to launch this week, but I think I may be retrying to be a perfectionist in wanting to capture all the emails and info I can, rather then just getting something going.  Something is better than nothing, right? The more time for the raffle, the more money to earn. So I guess that’s my project this weekend and operational stuff will have wait...again."
outsourcethat,fex5hiy,t1_fex3xfg,1579424765.0,"I'm hesitant to share the name because of now, it doesn't look like that much, but that is because I can do just about everything...except web development. I can do a basic landing page. But I really want to set this up right, make sure donors information is secure and that I am maximizing the information received from site visits. But it's a bit outside my scope. But the non-profit is called Clear Mind Events. We coordinate  with event promoters & festival organizers to provide relief spaces at large public venues and festivals for guest to manage symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorder, or sensory processing disorder, without having to leave the venue. Clear Mind Events arranges everything from site set up and management, community outreach, emphasizing engagement and education. And depending on the permission of the venue, we will offer a site walk around a day or two before the festival/event to those who would be able to attend if their anxiety was lessened by knowing what to expect and where to go. It got picked up way faster than I expected and my first festival is in May... and I don't even have a website. I've tried to outsource and have been screwed. Once financially and another a significant amount of my time, pretending they were doing something. We spent many hours and multiple video conferences chats, yet nothing was ever produced on their end.  I had two other gals from a marketing group who begged me to help. I offered any volunteer that works with us  free all access passes (the best back stages passes you can get)  to 3 day music festivals, valued around $300 for a normal pass, backstage would be worth double or triple for a 3 day festival that has 50 artist performing ) in their hometown, only for them to do a slow fade. I gave up trying to rely on people. Now, just want to piece  it out and outsource as I have the budget to do so."

internships,fevustx,t3_epjn9n,1579401789.0,Can it be in the US?
internships,fevte8f,t3_epzhp5,1579401248.0,"Hi, I have a recently established non-profit and I’d be happy to have you on board. Your work would on on events we do nationwide and connected to the largest independent festival promotor in the US.  Despite this, I have had difficultly finding reliable help.  It could be a paid position (or plenty of back stages perks), however I’ve been burned so much, I’m hesitant to offer a paid role. But inbox me and we can brainstorm and hopefully come up with an agreement that works for both of us."
ecommerce,fev0ghx,t3_eqlotr,1579391781.0,Why have woo commerce? Can you just put all the products on your webpage and just pay for the payment processors?
musicindustry,femknqv,t3_eo96xr,1579260343.0,My non-profit is looking for volunteer (and some paid) help. We attend festivals in the US.   Do you have any web development skills?
marketing,fefrxej,t1_fee9nho,1579063413.0,Great advice.
legal,fefr97l,t3_eot8x2,1579062890.0,"It depends what you think is worth it. I would for the $600 and a lot of that is principle too. You act super shady, I’m gonna call you out. But in this case, it doesn’t seem like you have any evidence so I need see a Judge siding with you.  (He May though, you never know what the other person will do or say). I know you have your card going into the Brovado account. But that doesn’t prove what for and it’s your word against his. But if you have something like a text, where he does respond and admit to owing you, then go for it."
legal,fefqlmp,t3_eox4hf,1579062391.0,Report everything to your insurance company. Give them the phone number. Write down times and things you remember now before you forget. Did he have any tattoos. What did the tow truck look like? Did you sign anything?  Text or email?  Write it down and give it to the insurance company.  It’s there job to investigate.
musicindustry,feej2cr,t3_eoog4g,1579034761.0,What other skills do you have outside adobe?  Any Web development?  What kind of music are you into?
CrazyIdeas,fe67301,t3_enjnsv,1578883259.0,"You won’t see a universal channel like this unless the larger promoters decided to band together and share their content.  There are a lot of logistics to professionally recorded live concerts, that only the really, really big ones doing it. That’s why most uploads on YouTube are fan recorded.  Many are being being recorded by the promoter, but not fo distribution."
todayilearned,fdyoxjd,t3_encb8o,1578782119.0,I believe the term is called “Fuck you money.”
aww,fdxzgdj,t1_fdxl4ha,1578774489.0,"Same. When we started fostering, they give you the cute kittens that just need to put in some weight. Then we moved to ones that needed medical care (mediations, wound care), and then bottle babies. I enjoyed every single group and did that for a number of year but where we really shined and our official title is The Socializers. I work from home so they didn’t get much time where I wasn’t here and got use to me.  And my daughter was very good with them and brought rounds of friends over to interact with kitties, they spent a ton of time holding and petting them. And I usually had some neighbors come over and do the same when word got out I had more kittens. It is pretty dang rewarding when we would take them back the shelter and the techs would say “ut-oh it’s Cersie” and kinda bunker down for a challenge.  During the exam, they’d look at me “is this the same cat?”   So now we get the all the little hissers and beezy’s. But at least I don’t have to get up every 2-3 hours for the babies."
aww,fdxwq2v,t3_en8enw,1578773709.0,"Oh the mess and hours that would have me when I was fostering bottle babies, perhaps still fostering them.  But the getting up every 2-3hrs with a full time job was exhausting me.  This is great!"
slavelabour,fco5x2o,t3_ehv0ou,1577824686.0,Bid - details in PM
slavelabour,fcnx8di,t3_cbamrn,1577820236.0,bid: would you be able to do that one gave out random fortunes to visitors of my website. It would have to be PG sice it's for a non-profit though.
legal,fclzvv7,t1_fcf1ygc,1577760596.0,"Yes, it is. That's why a continuance would drag this out. Be prepared to defend against the issue that the applicant is alleging.  If she brings up anything you are not aware of, tell the Judge that. The best advice I can give you though is to wait your turn to speak and do not get flustered. Even if she is spewing garbage, Judges do not like it when people interrupt (or even raise de their hand, shake their heads, etc). They try to run their court in a certain format and when you interject, usually just trying to defend yourselfc, it frustrates the Judges."
AskReddit,fcd2njz,t1_fccymr7,1577605598.0,"Well, that's why I said I challenge you. Make a commitment to do this for 30 days. See what happens.  The dates are an obvious coincidence. Pay attention to the less obvious ones. Instead if dismissing right away, give it one minute of your time. Simple, right? You will be amazed at the information your brain has stored for you and is saying ""hey...look at this!"" We concern ourselves and occupy our thoughts with issues that we need resolution for. But when it's presented before us, we don't notice it, or rationalize that it was a coincidence."
AskReddit,fccwr86,t1_fccck6s,1577603578.0,"There are no coincidences in life. That may be hard to understand now. But if you're ever open to understanding, read about it. We are quick to dismiss events as coincidences, but there is a reason we notice them. Whether it be more obvious like a birth/death date, or more subtle and be a fleeting thought that we give pause to, but quickly move on. I challenge you, that from here on out, every time you think something is a coincidence, take some time to think about it. Was this something that had been on your mind? Is it related to something you were concerned with and needed an answer or guidance? Our brains notice and prioritize things that are a ""coincidence"" for a reason...because we need to pay attention to them. Our brains have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to be the ultimate processor and of all the data coming in, why did this ""coincidence"" stick out to you?"
musicindustry,fccl3yq,t3_eggt4i,1577599649.0,"Soundcloud and Spotify.  If anyone that has some clout around them can post his content and be genuine about it, it's free marketing. The problem I see is, never performing live.  If you're truly passionate about something, you will find a way to make it work. He should already have suggestions on how to get the equipment he needs. ""I told XYZ that I would help clean up the bar if he let me rent/us XYZ equipment."" If he's not hustling more than you, I'd walk away right now and not waste your time. He needs to be HUNGRY. Get him on a stage. See how he does. If you can't build a local following, how can you perform at a national level?    Get him in front of people in any way, shape or form: open mic, poetry night, whatever.  If he's shook because of his age, he won't make it in the industry. He's got to know that he will feel stupid, he will question why he's doing this. Unfortunately, talent alone is not enough to make it these days. So many people have the ability to self-promote, he (or you) need to find a niche, or promote a special talent he has that makes him memorable form the next hip hop artist."

socialmedia,fccjfsl,t1_fcc211d,1577599089.0,"I'm not sure I'm the idiot in this situation. Nor did you realize that I offered advice. There is an amazing amount of free resources to learn the basic skills of facebook related to groups, pages, business managers, etc.  I highly recommend getting an understanding of the basics before you are concerned with to engage and grow a group. Do you need a page? Or is a group better your purpose? What about both? Or would having both detract and split up your following? Is the Group a private, privileged group, or is it public? If you're serious about this, it's best to get a basic understanding and foundation before you try to build.

 But, ok, I'm the idiot here. I can tell you're going to go very far in business."
legal,fccijlj,t1_fcbfu8a,1577598788.0,"That would delay the process. Which is it fine, but is probably exactly what the tenant wants.  The longer this dragged out, the longer she has a free place to stay. She likely doesn't have any assets he can attempt to get recovery from. I say be very prepared and bring whatever you can at the first hearing. Let her know you mean business. You can say you don't have time. But unless she was a tenant for years and theirs and there are hundreds of emails or exchanges to go through, tell the truth and let the Judge know that, within an appropriate amount of time, you can file evidence with the court for anything she may or may not alleged."

socialmedia,fcbzi04,t1_fc954fm,1577592706.0,"If you have to ask this, you really should be focusing on 101 Social Media Marketing topics. This isn't a complex answer that needs explaining. It's a but on the page you find by looking."
legal,fcbyyxe,t3_egzvxu,1577592533.0,"What do you need to prepare? Is there anything in writing from the tenant regarding any dispute?  If she's going to just make stuff up on the fly, I can't see her having any evidence against you. You're posting for legal advice, but your question is if anyone encountered this. What is your actual question?"
socialanxiety,fcbuh9f,t1_fcbpt28,1577591109.0,What are you doing to prepare for it?  My go to is Liquid courage.  Which festival?
Entrepreneur,famyxid,t1_fam1oqq,1576217249.0,I'm not at that stage yet. And probably won't need that advice as my connections are in-person through events I host. But I wouldn't be opposed to hiring an influencer.
