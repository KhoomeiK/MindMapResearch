It does get easier, but only by persistently doing what you **know to be right.** Every time you do something, it gets a little easier to do it again. So you want to keep tipping that balance in the direction of doing things you know will be beneficial.

---

Could you expand on what you are struggling with specifically? That would be very helpful.

For example, are you messy, forgetful, easily distracted, have trouble getting organized, making plans and carrying them through, it might be a good idea to get tested for ADHD. ADHD is basically when the part of your brain that takes care of these areas develops more slowly than in other people. So we might be really motivated and skilled but our real-world results don't live up to that. 

I mention it because, there are very effective medications available for ADHD, so if that is a factor in your case, it could make a huge difference to your life getting an accurate diagnosis. Also, I lived with ADHD without realizing it for most of my life, and it's the main reason I made such a mess of it.

If you relate to any of this, I recommend checking out r/ADHD. There's tons of resources and it's a very supportive community. They can help you find out how to get diagnosed.

---

You also mention self-hatred and doubt, which sounds a lot like depression. Being depressed will also cause trouble in all of these areas! The question here is do you still struggle to do what you know you need to do, even when you have enough energy / are in a good mood. 

Note that depression can be the *result* of these difficulties, as well as contributing to them. If you're having a really hard time, feeling bad is the normal response!

At any rate, it sounds like you need to see a mental health professional and explain in detail what you are having difficulty with. You must identify the causes behind your difficulties. It might be negative, limiting beliefs. It might be a health problem -- health problems can manifest as fatigue, depression, anxiety, trouble focusing etc.

Three things that really helped me
---

1. **Getting really clear on what I want in life.** By really clear I mean, ""realistically, if I do my best, what would my ideal life look like"", repeating this in the areas of career, relationship, friends, family, hobbies and habits (good and bad). Then making a specific plan for each area.

2. **Meditation.** I like Sam Harris' Waking Up Course. It's a paid app, kinda pricey, but if you can't afford it they don't want that to be an obstacle so you can ask nicely and get it free. The first few days of the course are always available for free.

Meditation helped me be more aware of my thoughts and feelings. When you notice your feelings and the thoughts that are creating them, you can choose to think different thoughts, and then you will take different actions too. Highly recommended.

3. **""Getting Things Done"" by David Allen.** This is a book, an audiobook and an audio course. Learning the GTD has by far been the greatest improvement to my organization and productivity. I know where to put everything. I know what everything is, and how to deal with it. And I don't have to *hope* I won't forget something: I know I'll see it at exactly the right time.

---

Hope this helps, and I hope you feel better soon!

ps. Self Kindness

a trick that helped me with my self-hatred was realizing the way I was treating myself, I would never talk to a friend that way. (I inherited it from my parents, who are pretty messed up.) So when I realized that I decided to be more respectful when communicating with myself. That helped a lot. Also, learning to be patient, and persistent. Accepting I'm going to screw up, *and* not letting that stop me keep trying.

Feel free to message me if you have any questions or want to talk. 

Best wishes"

I didn't mean setting up an extraction furnace in my bath tub though, I meant just holding on to them and selling them to a trash mining company in eg. 2050.

There's about $16,000 worth of gold in a ton of smartphones. The average phone weighs 150g, so there's ~6,666 phones per ton, and $16,000/6,666 = $2,40 worth of gold per phone. Those are 2013 numbers though, it's a bit less right now. I have no idea what the market will do over the next half century though."
Maps_of_Meaning,ffce3lf,t1_ffbxd1g,1579797482.0,"To put these numbers into perspective, I just ran the numbers. Let's say we could create a giant vehicle to roam the seas and constantly filter water. Lucky for us, those exist already, maybe we could just make a slight modification to filter gold too? :)

A whale shark filters 6,000 liters of water per hour. That sounds like a lot, but will it be enough?

 If we could modify a wale shark to filter gold instead of / on top of plankton, assuming 100% efficiency, it would take the whale shark 27 lifetimes (of 70 years) -- or it would take twenty-seven genetically modified whale sharks one lifetime - to extract 1 gram, $50 worth of gold.

Ok, that doesn't sound so good. Let's try with a bigger animal. The blue whale can filter ~200 tons of water in one gulp. Surely, 200 tons per minute is enough? 

Let's say it does this once a minute (they're big gulps!). The blue whale also lives 70 years = 36,792,000 minutes.

3679200 minutes * 200 tons = 735,840,000 tons of seawater filtered in one lifetime.

735,840,000  / 100,000,000 = you extract about 7,4 grams of gold

which gets you 7,4 * 50 = $370

the total revenue for a genetically modified, 100% efficient, gold-extracting blue whale would be $370

I hated math for years. Decades! I barely graduated high school.

But I want to be an inventor, so I had to do it... I started teaching myself math -- my arch-nemesis!

First I had to get over my anxiety. I didn't want anything to do with math! I had to sit with my anxiety, my resistance, and understand where it was coming from. I needed to re-evaluate my thoughts about math, and about my abilities.

It came from being asked to perform above my level, over and over again. So, when I was ready to begin again, I began at my level. I had holes all the way through, so I started filling in the gaps. I started with arithmetic, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. I realized I never learned them properly, never got enough practice! No wonder I was struggling with calculus!!!

So I patched up the gaps, and now I'm really enjoying it again, which surprised me! Now I get to take my time and really go into the details, build up an intuitive understanding.

**The thing about math is, if you get stuck somewhere, you really need to understand it before moving on.**

**The thing about school is, they can't afford to wait for you, they move on anyway** (just dragging you along until you're a bloody mess).

There's a great essay on math education, [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf), by Paul Lockhart. 

His main point is that math is actually an exercise of the imagination, a type of play, just like art or music, and if art or music were taught the same way we teach math, everyone would hate them the way they're taught to hate math!

Please, don't let school ruin your love of math, or any subject!

My idea reading this is that something about your self image is keeping you surrounding yourself with those kinds of people -- at least that has been my experience.

By self-image I mean, thoughts you habitually think about yourself. These thoughts can be changed. By observing my thoughts and choosing to think more constructively (I highly recommend mindfulness meditation for this, and I hear great things about CBT too) I changed my thoughts regarding math and waking up early. I thought I was ""bad at math"" and ""hated mornings"" but then I realized I've just had bad experiences with both, and I was able to let go of the attachment to those ideas, and consequently wake up earlier and begin enjoying math again.

For lack of a better word your ""vibe"" is drawing you to these people. On my first day I naturally connected with a guy who loved to smoke weed as much as I did, and within a week we'd found two more! These days I'm connecting with different kinds of people. Or you could call it your attitude, or mindset. Speaking of which, have you heard of Mindset by Carol Dweck? It talks about the super important difference between holding a ""fixed mindset""  vs a ""growth mindset"". Having a growth mindset is extremely beneficial to doing well academically (and in general!) and I highly recommend the book -- there is an audio version too. 

If your social influences are negative, try to get as much positivity from other sources. My favorite is positive audiobooks from the 80s, I could listen to them all day!

OP this is serious. Are you seeing any mental health professionals?  Is that an option for you (financially, insurance etc)? You need to find someone who can help you with these things. Right now, you need all the help you can get.

Your teachers sound pretty bad, sorry about that. You need to make the most of a bad situation. Is there anyone at the school you can talk to about your difficulties? If the schools deal with ADHD and dyslexia (and there's a good chance they do) you can talk to the same people about your experience. Some schools are better than others at this sort of thing but it's definitely worth a try.

Your descriptions bring me back.. I had a similar experience at school. Not a great time for me, to put it lightly. Hang in there.

Also, have you been tested for ADHD? It goes together with aspergers frequently and may be significantly contributing to your difficulties at school.

My second thought was executive (dys)function, which is a big part of autism, but also a part of bipolar:

> Current research provides strong evidence of cognitive impairments in individuals with bipolar disorder, particularly in executive function and verbal learning.

> Individuals affected by bipolar disorder exhibit deficits in strategic thinking, inhibitory control, working memory, attention, and initiation that are independent of affective state.

In my case I have the symptoms for bipolar, autism and ADHD. At this point ADHD seems kind of redundant since all its symptoms are basically covered by the other two.

To first address your question: Prozac can cause trouble sleeping (on top of what you already have without it) -- but so can Wellbutrin, it just depends on the brain lottery lol. You probably won't get a prescription combining the two. Also, it might be dangerous to mix with Adderall too (but not necessarily, and it might really help. But doctors don't like taking unnecessary risks).

Also, switching antidepressants can be very stressful, make sure you're in a relatively stable time in your life if you try this!

With that in mind, here are some other suggestions for both ADHD and sleep (and also depression and anxiety.. for real!)

---

Inflammation
---

Inflammation [the chronic kind] is the devil, when it comes to mental health.

**Inflammation is responsible for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and ADHD.**

It's not always the only cause (though it is sometimes), but it always makes these things worse.

At the core of inflammation is the gut, and gut health. That means food!

Here's a fun fact. In one study, **ADHD in nearly half the children went away completely after removing allergens from the diet!**

For me what helped most were paying attention to how I feel after eating specific foods. I identified wheat, oats, sugar and dairy as major culprits in my case. (It'll be different for everyone but these are some of the most common culprits.)

Beyond that I noticed that the less carbohydrates I eat, the better I feel. Not really sure why, but if it works, it works.

---

Dietary causes of inflammation
---

Some causes of inflammation:

* sleep deprivation (vicious cycle!)
* refined sugar (fiber removed -- fruits are OK)
* sunflower oil / vegetable oils (but olive oil OK)
* omega-6 (but omega-3 is anti-inflammatory)
* cheap (grain-fed) butter causes inflammation; grass-fed butter reduces it
* getting most of your energy from carbohydrates, in some cases (seems to be genetic. Low carb has worked wonders for me!)
* excess alcohol

also sometimes (depends on genetics)

* grains (esp. wheat, oats)
* dairy (can actually develop as the result of other allergies)
* soy
* etc (other common allergens. It doesn't have to kill you to cause trouble!)

---

the big aha!'s for me were:

* auto-immune conditions can be relatively mild (with the most severe symptoms being brain fog!)

* celiac (gluten intolerance) and other allergies can be mild (many people have it without ever realizing it's behind various issues)

also if you have any allergies or auto-immune conditions in the family, or you have gut pain, itching, dandruff / flakey skin / other skin problems, you may have an undiagnosed allergy.

---

Sleep
---

Before considering medication for sleep, I'd consider reviewing your sleep hygiene. I've watched a relative go down this path. Eventually your brain doesn't produce its own sleepy hormones anymore. Not good!)

* 1) **physically exhausting yourself every day.** My body refuses to fall asleep, even if my mind is tired, if my body is still full of energy! I worked as a mailman recently, running up and down stairs all day, and that was the best sleep I ever had!

* 2) **total darkness in the bedroom.** Use blackout curtains or a sleep mask. Even small amounts of light will interfere with sleep. (There's a reason mania is named after the moon!)

* 2b) **earplugs ( ! )** -- Surprisingly helpful. Living in the city, there's all sorts of little sounds coming in that we just get used to, but your brain has to process them the whole time! (Also recommended for concentrating at work -- noise-canceling earphones are more socially acceptable tho lol)

* 3) keeping the bedroom cool enough at night. This helps you fall asleep and improves sleep quality. I recommend keeping a window open too, it's essential to get plenty of oxygen, especially while sleeping.

* 3b) Ideally, gradually lower the temperature in your bedroom over the course of a few weeks. Your metabolism will adjust to the cooler temperature, as well as your perception.

---

I recommend [Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker](https://www.audible.com/pd/Why-We-Sleep-Audiobook/B0752ZQR33). It goes in depth into sleep hygiene. This is the audio book (I think people here like those better :)

It just so happens I have the book handy! 

Here are Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep, from the appendix:

* **Stick to a sleep schedule. *If there is only one piece of advice you remember from these twelve tips, let this be it.* Both for wake *and* bed time.**
* **Exercise is great** but not in the evening -- it will energize you!
* **Avoid caffeine and nicotine.** Caffeine can take a long time to wear off.
* Avoid alcohol before bed. Alcohol helps you fall asleep **but** reduces sleep quality (interferes with REM == learning, memory...)
* Avoid large meals and beverages before bed. (Your gut needs sleep, too!!)
* Avoid medicines that delay or disrupt sleep. Consult your doctor to see if any of your medications may be causing sleep problems.
* Don't take naps after 3pm. They make it harder to fall asleep.
* Relax before bed. **Set aside some time to unwind.** A relaxing activity, such as reading or listening to music, should be part of your bedtime ritual.
* Take a hot bath before bed. This helps you relax, and the drop in body temperature when you get out can help you fall asleep.
* Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom. [That means your phone! No reddit in bed LOL]
* **Daylight is key to regulating sleep cycle.** Expose your eyes to 30+ minutes of natural light a day, especially in the morning. (Reduce artificial light in the evening, especially bright or white light.)
* Don't lie in bed awake. If you can't sleep for more than 20 minutes, get up and go do something relaxing like reading or listening to music. 
* This helps for two reasons: (1) lying in bed awake --> anxiety --> insomnia. (2) You don't want to get used to being awake in bed. Bed is for sleeping and sex! If you're awake, go somewhere else until you get sleepy again."

I shared an interesting quote on ADHD and sleep patterns [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/emsgc8/been_at_work_for_four_hours_havent_done_a_damn/fdqxkhn/)

>What finally settled me was the sleep habits seen in ~70 percent of adults with ADD (shows up after puberty). What happens is, we end up having a shift in our circadian rhythm. Instead of the typical, sleep at night, wake at light, our schedule tends to shift. We end up being fatigued, distracted, throughout the day - irregardless of whether we had enough sleep the night before- and then when the sun goes down, instead of becoming tired, we can become more awake, more alert, staying bright eyed and bushy-tailed until 3, 4 AM. Then when we do try to sleep (especially if we try to be reasonable and go to sleep at eleven or midnight) we can't. We toss and turn, our minds race, we just can't turn it off. One theory is that at night there are fewer distractions, so it's easier for us to become focused, the other that we have a dysfunctional circadian rhythm. Our inner clocks aren't actually on a 24 hour cycle, so normally our brains reset the clock every night - that may not happen in ADD. Then when we finally manage to sleep, it's like we're dead. Waking us up is impossible, even with seven, eight hours of sleep. We snooze through multiple alarms. If someone wakes us up, we're so delirious that we can have entire conversations, pass out, and not even know that they happened. Mornings are hell.

Apparently Wellbutrin can help

>[Wellbutrin] improved my sleep cycle, making it easier to wake up, vastly improved my focus, and treated my depression.

The night time activity is called [hypomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania) and I've pretty much learned to live with it, and I get most of my creative work and chores done at night time. (I'm currently deciding whether to get medicated and try be normal, or find a way to earn money doing some kind of creative work at night.)

So, on a species level, there's pretty much two things that matter. Not dying, and having sex. Once you get not dying covered, you start to think about sex. (Other animals tend to do it seasonally but in humans it's just always-on.)

On the species level, not-dying *is* sex. Because if all the members of the species are safe from harm, but none of them have sex, the whole species still dies.

For me it's maybe, 20% of the evenings are like that (the rest are just, boredom and exhaustion), and those are usually when I'm restless for some real-life reason or I just had too much caffeine or cacao. (Forgot to mention -- cacao is subtle, but it's powerful! You won't feel it as much, but it will keep you awake!)

I realized recently that I have trouble visualizing (I have to use language to do math and it's very inefficient), and that it's because I turned it off on purpose, as I grew older my mental images became less fun and more and more about things I was worrying about. Vivid imagination + negative thinking = awful. So lately I've been reconnecting with that and practicing visualizing peaceful or positive images.

I used to really like going to sleep, I'd imagine all kinds of epic battles and robots and scifi stuff, but as I began to worry during the day (due to grades getting worse and worse) I began to worry during the night too. I basically haven't been able to relax since high school."
