AmITheAngel,ffiem79,t3_ets8me,1579972028.0,It’s amazing how people are taking this at face value. I fall for a fair deal of AITA but there is obviously information missing. A professional therapist wouldn’t just suggest that a client’s boyfriend would sleep with their son without ANY other context.
AmITheAngel,ffie07h,t1_ffibak0,1579971615.0,AITA just doesn’t like children in general unless they’re under 18 and making a post. Then they’re NEVER the asshole.

AmItheAsshole,fff7m8v,t1_ffevfqy,1579877741.0,Probably because it’s a made up story so it doesn’t make much sense.
FancyFeet,ffc4e8f,t3_estr5k,1579791251.0,"Excuse me, but is Twerpette her given name? 

That’s glorious."
AmITheAngel,ffc3jvq,t3_esrzua,1579790665.0,How about an attorney saluting the red flag for “lawyer up”?
traderjoes,ffa5tk6,t1_ffa4qdf,1579728456.0,A lot of plant based meats that I’ve seen have a high amount of fat. I don’t know why though.
AmItheAsshole,ff951re,t1_ff92tri,1579705014.0,"They’re breadcrumbs, she said it in the post. OP is also a child as well."
FancyFeet,ff7qp0y,t3_ertlhv,1579656030.0,Fawkward.
AmITheAngel,ff6kqar,t3_ertjwk,1579629282.0,"All obvious validation posts have “my family thinks I’m an asshole”, like that’s justification. Of course they have to ask because 3 people *might* be right that you’re an asshole for doing X when you know damn well you wouldn’t be."
FondantHate,ff3qu18,t1_ff38vp4,1579546872.0,100%. Sugar? Just shredded fondant. Butter? Cold fondant. Eggs? Liquid fondant. All fondant all the time baby.
90DayFiance,ff3lkng,t3_ercxpo,1579543638.0,"The only decent thing about this scene was Robert’s sister trying to defend Anny, she’s a little angel."
90DayFiance,ff3lesx,t1_ff39jft,1579543537.0,"The guy on the right is Robert’s brother. At one point Anny said Robert lies about having 5 kids (he previously had told her he had 3), and his brother responded with “WeLl I hAvE 7” like she should be grateful Robert only had 5."
vegetarian,ff3kvjz,t1_ff2xfbs,1579543210.0,"I’d be on board. I joined this sub to get more vegetarian influence, if I wanted vegan I’d go to... well r/vegan."
AmItheAsshole,feieu80,t1_fei99d0,1579136869.0,Why would CPS need to be called? Because they think a 9-year old asks too many questions? Relax.
