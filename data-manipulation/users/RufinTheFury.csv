Chopper is the other song always in rotation. It's hard. I like posse cuts. 

Absolutely love the hook on Dots and Lines. Body of Work has that amazing sax solo. The interludes are great and tie the album together thematically while separating the songs soundwise. Madonna through TRON is a fantastic 3 song run to end the album.
