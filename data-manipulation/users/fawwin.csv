SuicideWatch,fdpilqh,t1_fdoxd6f,1578629613.0,"This sounds like something that happens in India itself. In America it’s a more nuanced type of abuse in my opinion.

Still, I totally agree with and that’s what makes it so difficult to correct express the struggle to those who have never been in that specific situation"
SuicideWatch,fdondcv,t1_fdo1hyg,1578608680.0,"Interesting point of view, friend. What makes me optimistic is that I will learn from my parents’ mistakes (probably as a response to that aforementioned fear of repetition of scars) in which I will raise my future child less like how I was raised. I want to have more open conversations with my child and to be trusted by my child in the same way that my parents learned from their parents about how to raise a child (which is why I’ve never been hit or physically abused in any way like my parents have when they were young)."
SuicideWatch,fdomsn6,t1_fdnzyju,1578608336.0,Hopefully some prestigious business school like UT Austin
SuicideWatch,fdnvb6k,t1_fdnute9,1578593572.0,"I haven’t and Ive gotten many tips so I have some strategies with dealing with the stress. At the end of the day though, I just want to get out"
SuicideWatch,fdnr5mz,t1_fdnnz5a,1578591224.0,Yeah so close yet so far it feels
SuicideWatch,fdnmoxt,t1_fdnj47e,1578588995.0,"My mom pressured me heavily to do the IB program because many of my peers are in IB (the same peers I’m constantly compared to) and she thought that the program would help me get into a good college.

It was the one time in my life I put my foot down and told her straight that I would not do IB due to the intense workload with relatively low payoff and that I would rather do AP classes at a public school and keep my middle school friends. 

I’m very proud of my decision because I would’ve definitely disgracefully dropped out had I participated in IB. Mad respect for you and anyone else in IB and haven’t dropped."
SuicideWatch,fdngh8k,t1_fdnc9cr,1578585295.0,That’s what I thought. I’ll try my best.
SuicideWatch,fdn70yw,t1_fdn6j7j,1578579035.0," My dude, I AM in the US and I totally feel you with the BS mental health system. It is cheaper to travel all the way to Bangladesh and get healthcare than to even step foot in a hospital here. 

I don’t want to go into a mental hospital, just a therapist."
SuicideWatch,fdn64ro,t1_fdn3so7,1578578342.0,That’s understandable and I wish there was more awareness to this issue along with the growing awareness for mental health in general.
SuicideWatch,fdn5ibl,t1_fdn3sg3,1578577853.0,"I’m sort of doing both. I do have a very laid out plan of what I’m going to do in my future (marketing because marketing is fun :)) and I know business is a field my parents are accepting of. 

However, I agree about the lack of emotional intelligence thing. The guy I want to be with is white which is a hugeeee no no but it’s like sorry it’s how I feel and how I felt for years now. 

Even then, I’m just patiently waiting for graduation. Once I do, I won’t have to have a single damn about anyone. For now, I’m stuck like this and will be continuing to try to please my parents until I finally get out."
SuicideWatch,fdn54xe,t1_fdn39vm,1578577555.0,"I do have a group of friends who support me: my American school friends. I know that they can’t fully relate to this issue but I know that they are trying their best to understand and they are quite sympathetic when my mom walks into my room while I’m talking to them telling me to turn off my phone and study. 


This is good advice and I recommend it to others too."
SuicideWatch,fdn4a8h,t1_fdn2d63,1578576861.0,"I don’t smoke but I’ve honestly been thinking about going into it for that same reason but there are also a lot of consequences to smoking so I don’t know.

Though you call your parents from away from home, do you still maintain low contact?"
SuicideWatch,fdn41bd,t1_fdmzgtv,1578576655.0,"I don’t know. I kind of disagree.

From what I’ve seen so far in America and my travels from NY to CA, I’ve seen that parents tend to be a bit more permissive with their kids and, well, actually let them have bf and gf so they understand relationships at an early age. Or, unlike many parents in my culture, have a level of acceptance towards community colleges because they give you necessary education at a very low price. 

I don’t doubt that there are parents from other cultures like mine (such as the Filipinos and that turkey comment) but it’s kind of ironic how the experience I described in my post is soooo common in Asian culture that it has become a stereotype."
SuicideWatch,fdn3myb,t1_fdmyrif,1578576320.0,"3 idiots is one of my favorite Bollywood movies from the music to the comedy to the tragedy. It’s such a great movie and both reactions are completely acceptable.


When I first watched it, I also just laughed at them and I didn’t understand that one bit (it’s the saddest part of the movie and I hope you know what I’m talking about)

It was when I started feeling how I felt in my post when I understood that scene."
SuicideWatch,fdn3bhn,t1_fdmxfyx,1578576045.0,"I’m out here getting a 72 on my calculus bc midterm exam and having to frantically explain to my parents how everyone else did just as terrible.

Edit: The second I sent that I felt that I was trying to leg you up for lack of a better term. Apologies. Just wanted to say I relate."
SuicideWatch,fdn368k,t1_fdmuye6,1578575920.0,"I tried to an extent. Both of my parents are highly educated in math and science and work in those fields. I’ve come up to them before with hypothetical questions dancing in the realm of mental health and the ethics around certain parenting styles. I’ve concluded that they are just too empirical and I think to myself: “if my mom does not understand why people are driven to suicide or the extent in which depression is not directly linked with only social media, how can I possibly explain to her how I feel? Especially since she thinks that’s she’s doing a great job at parenting because she compares herself to Asian parents who mercilessly beat their kids”

Edit: My question is this: should I go up to my parents and be blunt?"
