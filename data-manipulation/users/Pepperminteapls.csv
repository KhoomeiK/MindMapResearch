Cannabis oil puts you in a relaxed state you cant achieve otherwise. Improved quality of life can drastically change how you feel and heal. You simply can't dismiss it unless you've tried every strain of oil and that's impossible because cannabis strain varieties can be created endlessly. 

CBD is very helpful with stress, anxiety and I'm sure he's dealing with alot of it. Get a nice 10/10 THC/CBD hybrid oil and you're feeling good without being too stoned. Or straight CBD without any head high with great pain relief. Shit works whether you want to believe it or not. It's not going to cure most life threatening illnesses but it will help people during treatment or when they're near the end.

Watch the video of the man with parkinsons or read about charlotte figi or even videos of rick simpson to give you an idea of how it can help.
