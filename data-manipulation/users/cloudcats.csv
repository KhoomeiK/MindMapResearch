kilimanjaro,ffdcng7,t3_eri2tk,1579818061.0,"I went with Kilimanjaro Experts.  Found their service top-notch.  We did the Alternative Lemosho over 8 days.  Definitely go with a longer route - it's fun to spend more time there as it's so beautiful.  We really enjoyed this route too as it's more remote (less people) and trekking through the forest was lovely.

Make sure you pick a KPAP-certified operator.  Don't take the company's website as ""proof"" as some say they are even when they are not.  Check with KPAP to see the current list of approved guide companies."
kilimanjaro,ffdcg4c,t3_et0gx3,1579817933.0,132L is HUGE (and will probably weigh more because of it).  I took a 90L and that was a perfect size for me.  Maybe see if you can borrow or rent?  They will just stuff it inside another bag anyhow so possibly it won't matter.  If you ask the company you are trekking with I'm sure they will be able to tell you.

It's like expecting someone ugly to only be attracted to ugly people."
