books,ffj5nw2,t1_ffj4rxu,1579991025.0,Ok. But libraries are pretty cool too! And since they pay royalties you are also supporting authors and publishers.

books,ffewsyp,t3_et946o,1579868734.0,"I personally never understand why people dog ear books. It just damages the books and there are other ways to mark a page. 

That said, anything useful like underlining, some notes in the margins ect. I'm all for. Books need to be used! And I personally do love it, if I buy a used book and some some stranger had made some notes or something in it. It opens a new perspective to see what another person found important."

TwoXChromosomes,ffebegi,t3_et1e9b,1579842072.0,"What is their definition of 'loss of virginity'?

Is it when you start being sexually active or have your first sexual experience? - you were/had not! You were assaulted! Nobody in their right mind can say that's the same. 

Is it when your hymen is not intact anymore? - Then many girls that use tampons need to be considered not a Virgin anymore or others with a wide hymen will stay virgin till they have a child, because it won't break during intercourse.

For the life of me I can't think of a valid definition of 'losing ones virginity' that would make it seem valid and just to include childhood abuse/assault. 

In my opinion, comments like these are unbelievably rude, insensitive and callous! I wish, for yourself and all the other survivors out there, that you set them straight, if you can, and make it very clear that comments like this are not acceptable under any circumstance. 

Thank you for what you are doing for other young women and girls! It's in **no way wrong or shameful** to talk about these things, but I know myself that it's often hard to do so. So sincerely *Thank you*"

relationship_advice,ffcjymy,t1_ffcbyjv,1579801066.0,"This is quite on the point. Please don't let him (or anyone) pressure you into moving faster than you feel comfortable. 

The age difference is a huge red flag already. Much more than in later stages of your life. Because those kind of men (late 20s going for teenagers) often look for girls easy manipulated, who are too inexperienced to see all their red flags they bring to the table besides the age. Most of them have women their age running in no time!

And a couple of months in talking about moving in, babies, marriage ...uff.. that's a huge red flag also. Especially when it's one-sided. This doesn't sound like a healthy relationship at all and **you really need to look out for yourself here!!** Be very careful what you commit to and don't get yourself in a situation where you are dependent (financially as much as emotionally) on a possibly toxic relationship."
