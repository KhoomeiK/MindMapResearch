todayilearned,ff91hnc,t3_esasvv,1579702486.0,">In 1714, Wessel was court-martialled after an indecisive sea battle with a Swedish frigate. The account of the incident is verified by the legal proceedings from November 1714. On 26 July 1714, he encountered a frigate under English flag near Lindesnes, while flying a Dutch flag on the Løvendals Gallej himself. The other frigate was De Olbing Galley carrying 28 guns, which had been equipped in England for the Swedes and was on its way to Gothenburg under the command of an English captain named Bactmann. De Olbing Galley signalled for Løvendals Gallej to come closer, and as Wessel raised the Danish flag, Bactmann fired a broadside at him.[5] In the English captain, Wessel met a tough match.[4] The combat lasted all day, and when De Olbing Galley tried to escape in the evening, Wessel set more sails and continued the duel.[5] The fight was interrupted by nightfall, and renewed again indecisively the following morning.[4] Both ships were badly damaged after around 14 hours of fighting, when Wessel was running out of ammunition. He then sent an envoy to the English ship, cordially thanking the English for a good duel, and asked if he could borrow some of their ammunitions in order to continue the fight. His request was denied, and the captains drank to each other's health, before the ships dispersed.[5][6]

>When he heard about the incident, king Frederick IV of Denmark asked for the admiralty to court-martial Wessel.[3] He stood trial in November 1714, accused of disclosing vital military information about his lack of ammunition to the enemy, as well as endangering the ship of king Frederick IV by fighting a superior enemy force.[5] The spirit with which he defended himself and the contempt he poured on his less courageous comrades took the fancy of Frederick IV.[4] He successfully argued a section of the Danish naval code which mandated attacking fleeing enemy ships no matter the size, and was acquitted on 15 December 1714. He then went to the king asking for a promotion, and was raised to the rank of Captain on 28 December 1714.[5]

pics,ff5cxlx,t3_erll28,1579587720.0,"Yeah, literally none of this is the reasoning behind the 2nd amendment. We know, because the framers wrote down their reasoning in the Federalist Papers. Hamilton was Washington's right hand during the war (Broadway nerds sit down), and, like Washington and Adams, grew frustrated with Congress' ability to supply the Army during wartime. They became Federalists specifically because they saw the weak central government as a hinderance to the freedom that can be delivered by a large power ready to fend off foreign oppression.

Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay collectively wrote eighty five essays, known as the Federalist Papers, to persuade people, from those in politics to the average citizen, that the new constitution will be aid in the growth of the young nation. Alexander Hamilton's Federalist 29: ""Concerning the Militia"", describes what he implies would become of the militia, which was a key component of state defense at a time when

1. We weren't nearly as united as a nation.

2. We didn't keep a standing army

""if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.'' 

Basically, the idea was that the 2nd Amendment was that the people could protect themselves from a standing army (like the one we eventually decided we actually wanted) by being *equally well armed*. Meaning that the correct application of the 2nd Amendment isn't letting people have some civilian-designed-highly-impractical piece of bullshit weaponry, but that the government is obligated to ensure everyone has unmanned drones and arguably nuclear weapons. And if the people cannot afford these, then they should be subsidized by the government.


Or we can agree the founders had no idea weaponry would advance beyond a 90-second reload and that this amendment is kind of archaic today."
