He explicitly states that these descriptions of colors don't help him understand color whatsoever. It's too foreign of a concept to describe with words, he explains.

""The sky is blue, but so is water? How can you tell the difference? Ice has no color at all, and also fire can be blue? This doesn't make any sense.""

Even with the color black, which you would think he is actually familiar with, he has no concept of. How could he? These ""descriptions"" of color, however beautiful or meaningful to sighted people, hold no meaning to those who have never seen a color before. I don't mean to be a bummer, but I'm going to take Tommy's word for this one."

Flash forward 5 years, that's Xmas of last year. My gf gets me the *exact* same earring for Xmas. Mind you she never had any way of knowing I owned that earring, and when I told her I had previously lost this earring, she gave me a really confused look. The earring she had gotten me was a new piece from a renowned jewelery store in California. I denied this reality and decided to look for it on the net. I found nothing except that this earring came out only months ago, not years... So what did I lose!? Could it be that time is non-linear, or am I crazy?"

FF9 is an absolute treasure trove of Shakespearean characters, plot lines, and Victorian-Era cultural allusions. Even the royal family and minor characters are named after Shakespeare characters (usually with tiny differences so as not to be so explicit). However, the Shakespearean feel of the game and it's story still stays in the background while the foreground gets a ""rennaisance"" of Final Fantasy lore: Non-human citizens, black mages, parties of 4, character classes, princesses and castles, moogles etc.
