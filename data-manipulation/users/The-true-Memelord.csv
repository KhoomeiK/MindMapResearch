wholesomememes,ffu0ou7,t3_ev4e65,1580231960.0,"I want to cry sometimes when I'm alone, so it doesn't burst out, out of nowhere when I'm with other people. But when I'm alone, I just can't. Unless I was just in an argument or something and I'm super angry so that makes me sad. I mean I'm always super sad in a way because I have this underlying sadness(because of a horrible complex situation that I'm in), even though I feel, well, ok I guess. As ok as I can be where I am right now. I know emotions are natural and stuff, they don't make me ""weak"", but I still sometimes feel ashamed if I cry in public. My face just has this sad ugly look on it and my voice is all...You know how it is. 

I didn't plan to write that much ._."

aaaaaaacccccccce,ffthzuk,t3_ev09uu,1580221059.0,"If people do think I'm straight, which they probably do, I don't like it. It would be great if people just knew my sexuality instantly. I'm open about my sexuality, I'm not really planning to come out, because I don't want to make such a big thing about it, being queer is normal. I'm not really hiding it, if someone says something related to it or asks about it, I'll say it."
