malaysia,ffe6m0f,t1_ffe4gvm,1579838080.0,"I know the feel bruv. My uni days I had a communal kitchen I shared and my milk, food and utensils always go missing. I check around and it’s in my housemates cupboards. When I confronted them, they’re like oh I thought it’s shared. If it’s shared why they fuck is it in your cupboard then? Sorry brought up some bad memories haha. I had a knife I loved that was lost to these scum :("

I want [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/ZwJ3mdZmFcUBCvpY6) printed in a nice wall hanging size. If anyone’s wondering thats a print of Le Pater by Alphonse Mucha."

hearthstone,fefz1wv,t1_fefbx4l,1579070115.0,"Lol this is exactly what I was thinking. These ultra aggressive players are complaining that a deck is designed to outlast their damage and they can’t win by turn 6, so that deck must be OP and nerfed. 

And add to that that it’s Priest, the most hated class in Hearthstone. Perfect for all the whiners to come out. If it was control Warrior, we wouldn’t even be saying anything."
hearthstone,fefmonw,t1_fef81vx,1579059649.0,If you lose then you lose. You would’ve lost that 30 mins winning anyway. It’s the point of the game. You’ve got to win and lose sometimes. I don’t understand the mentality here.
hearthstone,fefkeqg,t1_fef5jst,1579058196.0,"Lmao everyone hating cuz it’s Priest. 

Every other expansion Rogue, Shaman, Druid, Warrior fuck you up the asshole for months on end, but when Priest has a decent deck for a rotation, all the whiners come out. 

This is the literal cycle of Priest, useless for 9 months out of the standard rotation, and decent for the remaining part of standard, and all the Priest haters come out of the woodwork."
hearthstone,fefk1p8,t1_fefhnn6,1579057971.0,Literal infinite deck vs deck that has two board revival spells. Hmm one is definitely more bullshit than the other but I don’t think you and I are seeing eye to eye.
