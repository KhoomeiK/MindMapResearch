Because I'm not from your neck of the woods and wasn't brought up in your house, with your parents, and your values it's always going to be impossible for me to truly understand. It's so easy from someone on the left that's been brought up left, in a left town, with left parents and friends to dismiss the right as crazy. And neither will have discussions with the other or ask questions for fear of being called a centrist, its mad.
