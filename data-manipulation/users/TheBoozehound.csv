You’re totally, right here. But if you’re ok with enjoying your game the way you play it, why post online to a forum who’s theme is to give you feedback on your post, only to then counter that feed back? People are allowed to play games the way they want, and that’s ok. People are also allowed to downvote shit points like yours, and that’s ok. Take your well deserved, cheating ass downvotes and move on.

Your post and comment are bullshit. You wanted to brag about your clever way of cheating, and now you’re tying to explain your bullshit post in the face of backlash. You would have gotten further if you had just said “fuck you haters, I do what I want” and taken your downvotes like an adult. Instead you go “yea, I’m cheating, but, like, I toooootally crushed the game before so, like, I don’t need to anymore.”

Plagues don’t care about your preference in people.

I came up on a a small ridge, walked 3 feet forward and a fucking desert rattlesnake just materialized. He had been there the whole time but so well camouflaged that I didn’t notice him until I was 2 feet away and he started rattling. I’d never heard a rattle snakes rattle before, but before I even saw the snake, I knew what the sound was. It throws your whole body into “oh shit mode.” 

I screamed “AW FUCK” like a little girl and stumbled back, putting all if my weight and the weight of my backpack on my left knee, which still hurts if I’m hiking down hill.

Now I know what you’re thinking, “well Mr. r/boozehound, you were out hunting so surely you had a firearm with you, I’ll bet you ate rattlesnake by the campfire that night!” And if you thought that, you’d be dead wrong. See when I screamed “AW FUCK” like a little girl and stumbled back, I frantically hip fired my 12-gauge shotgun at that menacing snake! 3 rounds (the max allowed by CA hunting laws) **boomBoomBOOM** 

I missed every single round....

And the snake? Oh, he didn’t give a fuck. He stayed coiled up in strike pose and slowly slithered to the left of me until he got into a small rocky out crop as I was frantically trying to reload my shotgun. And there the snake stayed, rattling at me, hidden in that rocky-bushy outcrop. Mocking me...
