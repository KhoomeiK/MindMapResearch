The world does not budge an inch to let in someone different, it's worth finding a way to balance your individuality with also fitting in. I'm not talking change yourself, I just mean if you recognise the value of fitting in, you can make choices on what to wear, say, or do in different situations instead of blindly thinking the world should accept you. Because you absolutely will be fighting against the tide in your career if you don't look, act and talk the right way. You might be super successful, but it'd be quicker and easier to get there if you didn't have adhd already, so why add more barriers on top of that? (source: my life, ymmv)."
