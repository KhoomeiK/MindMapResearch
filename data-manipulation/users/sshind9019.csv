SuicideWatch,fd10oen,t1_fd0yn6r,1578126339.0,I understand how feeling staved of attention can be really discouraging. I wish typeface could be more personable. I totally would talk to you in person if possible.

SuicideWatch,fcy2iks,t1_fcy218a,1578073942.0,That makes sense. It's unfortunate that there isn't ever an easy answer on how to deal with a traumatic experience. Would you mind filling in the details of the substance abuse?

SuicideWatch,fcxtl97,t3_ejhtk3,1578070210.0,"I don't personally have this experience, but my Mom does. She was the youngest sibling by a few years and as a result the rest of her siblings were constantly messing with her. 

It took a while, but when everyone grew up they became pretty close friends. No one my Mom is very close with the rest of siblings and they get along great (which is really surprising if you know some of the stories). 

I know it sucks that there isn't really anything you can do about it right now, but hopefully with time and age your siblings will start to be a little more inclusive. I certainly hope so."
