Having a pet put to sleep is one of the hardest things in the world. You know it’s the right thing to do and that keeping them alive in pain is selfish but your heart still shatters as you hold them as they go to their final sleep. I’ve done it for four of our cats over the years and it never ever gets any easier. I still miss them."
