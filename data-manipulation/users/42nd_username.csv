Futurology,fezf2j6,t1_feyfe0r,1579456667.0,"Oh holy fuck yes.  You don't fall for scams but they work really well right?  You don't fall for advertising but it's the worlds biggest industry, right?  You're too crafty for prices that end in .99 to trick people into thinking it's a dollar less, right?

These things work and they work reliably.  I could go into the technical details about muddying the waters, disinformation campaigns, hyper targeting at risk populations, A/B testing and a million more tricks.  It's actually fascinating if you want to look into it more.  Basically new tools (internet social media), big data sets, and smarter algorithms allow much more effective influencing than ever before.  

And it works VERY well, and is shockingly easy for state actors to influence elections across the planet to ruin other countries."

No, they explicitly said in the movies that hes was an amazing pilot BECAUSE he was force sensitive.  The line was something like ""he's such a great pilot because he sees things before they happen"".  

Rey getting a new glow stick and using it to beat Kylo was such a huge plothole the deathstar could have flown through it.  Imagine a sword master who's trained their entire life with the worlds best swordmasters going up against someone who was just handed a sword 5 minute before.  As long as the sword master could lift their blade they would win without doubt.  An olympic fencer versus you with a foil.  It's not even close in any universe."

Yes holy fuck it was nice.  We have board games and radio headsets for each person and movie nights each friday. A full library.  We would all save up our 'soups' (aka ramen noodle flavor packets) and put it on the popcorn and chill out.  Hell there was even a little fairy-boy in there with us the oldtimers joked if I was feeling horny I could visit.  I was on the kitchen work crew and we gave the whole jail it's food and gave ourselves double portions.  Honestly if it was for a real cause and not for dumb shit it would be a decent life.   
aka if it were life on mars or antartica or a submarine research station or the worlds last seed vault it would be a good life.
