FeltGoodComingOut,ffq9kb0,t1_ffpwsik,1580127168.0,0/10 do not recommend. Managed to remove it myself by frantically wiggling my ear though.
FeltGoodComingOut,ffpoehb,t1_ffpjbal,1580100288.0,I woke up to a spider in my ear once and there’s something super panic inducing hearing and feeling a scratching in your ear. He might not have known what it was either.
AmItheAsshole,ffh8yeb,t1_ffgo0l9,1579926535.0,Same. I nearly passed out from low pressure and have been told not to go again. Still doesn’t stop them from emailing me every few months because I’m O+
AmItheAsshole,ffh8kv2,t1_fffi8c2,1579926211.0,How does a person manage to rack up that much in utilities?
TalesFromTheCustomer,fffs07z,t1_fffings,1579890529.0,"Maybe not the traditional way, but naan isn't too bad of a bread to make. I've managed with a cast-iron skillet"
AnimalsBeingBros,fffnncs,t1_fffifd8,1579887848.0,Mine gets super bouncy as soon as it gets below 35F.
Delightfullychubby,ffbzqch,t1_ff9cept,1579787786.0,The world record for oldest cat is something like late 30’s I think
AmItheAsshole,ffavfeh,t1_ff8isqd,1579745402.0,"Grandpa’s rule for calling/visiting was 9a-9p, and I personally extended that for anything noisy when my roomies are home."
badwomensanatomy,fepl6uc,t1_fepkrec,1579323407.0,I know but they make a cheese from the whey too. I think it’s called gjetost?
badwomensanatomy,fepk5cq,t1_fep99rf,1579322596.0,Oh are you talking about that whey goat cheese? I got to try it for class and loved it. So hard to find though :(
olemiss,fecjlqf,t3_eobtej,1578975498.0,"It depends on what's important to you. Space and having to share a bathroom with as few people as possible? Go with a contemporary dorm like Minor, Lucky Day, or one of the RHs. Want to be close to the union and interact with the people on your floor a little more? Go with the traditional. I will say that the sound carried really well in Steward (traditional) and I vaguely remember a contemporary dorm where you could adjust the temp. It's been a while though"
otherkringe,fe44d19,t1_fe41odg,1578855701.0,Body dysphoria maybe??
AmItheAsshole,fe0e97n,t1_fdt9yjf,1578811683.0,"I grew up without one of my (much older) siblings because he overcorrected when he ran off the shoulder of the road changing out CDs and flipped. 

That’s also the reason why I refused to move my car an inch until everyone was buckled in in high school. Better everyone be pissy than OP having to take care of a grave for the rest of their life. It was pretty harsh but ultimately for her safety."
NarutoFanfiction,fdvrtga,t1_fduktbd,1578750817.0,Thank you :)
wholesomememes,fdlinsq,t1_fdlfjxn,1578524859.0,Managed to pick that up from my grandma I think but I’m here in the Deep South.
wholesomememes,fdkwz3a,t1_fdkqv4b,1578512880.0,Same but it’s also easier to call people pet names if you don’t know their name
wholesomememes,fdkwvr9,t1_fdkvqn3,1578512825.0,Don’t forget all the extra words that can be added in to call you a giant dumbass. I like to use “bless your pea pickin’ heart” personally.
NarutoFanfiction,fdjaava,t1_fdja3my,1578463092.0,I love Haku. Would you mind linking it?
AmItheAsshole,fdj158h,t1_fdhzc42,1578455785.0,A spray bottle might be more convenient.
NarutoFanfiction,fdioub0,t3_el6x56,1578447706.0,"So one of the equations for ideal body weight that I learned in Medical Nutritional Therapy was females 5'=100lbs +5lbs for every extra inch +/- 10% and males: 5'= 106lbs +6lbs for every extra inch +/- 10%. That makes all of them at the very bottom of their ideal weight range or below it, which I might be able to *maybe* believe for some of the slight, long-range/non-taijutsu fighters. Not for the broader people or the close-range fighters though. Honestly, I think people just throw numbers that sounded right out without much thought."
AskMen,fdfqo9c,t1_fdewevx,1578367876.0,Do your thighs kill your jeans too?
ofcoursethatsathing,fddzd46,t1_fddy2i6,1578327639.0,Big oof on the acne. I hope you find something that works for you. I feel you on the hair thing though. I got a foot of it chopped off during the summer and it took me a month to stop try to move it over my shoulder when I sat down
ofcoursethatsathing,fdcmobg,t1_fdceaqn,1578278713.0,"This might be a bit too personal, but did you have to switch up your whole care routine? Like all your soaps and how often you washed your hair if it's long?"
AskWomen,fcwo6k4,t1_fcwhzqv,1578031346.0,It’s a bit different but I think that one is also pretty nice as someone who also wears Tease
tuckedinkitties,fcub2as,t1_fctfzvz,1577976811.0,Mine likes to be the big spoon. It’s hilarious when she tries to wrap her little arm around me.
