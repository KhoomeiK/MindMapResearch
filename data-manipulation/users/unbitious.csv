suboxone,ffrqsjf,t3_eut8zb,1580163756.0,"My personal experience with Tramadol, if used wisely and in low doses, is that it is the perfect drug to slowly taper off of opiates. That said, I'm only speaking of the physical aspects. I had Tramadol available for years, but I kept lapsing with other opiates. Because I always had that easy get-out-of-jail-free card, I kept fucking up. The one thing Suboxone has over Tramadol is that it will block everything else at a high enough dose. It took getting on Suboxone for me to maintain enough clean time to actually get sober long-term. But if you can do it with Tramadol, more power to you! I think it is less dependence forming, and has less negative side effects."
