In accordance with the idea of universal human rights and equivalence of every individual human's life, there should be no ranking of ""worth"" of treating someone, based on the decisions he made, political/religious views he held etc. 
The only ways to make such treatment rankings should be by necessity and chances of succes of the medical treatment."
