canucks,ffjiyyw,t1_ffjiqee,1579999285.0,"I live in Toronto now so that doesn't bother me too much, but when I was growing up in Vancouver, it just got so natural for me to rip on Leafs."

3 on 3 is even better though."
nfl,ffbejlh,t3_esjbjj,1579761893.0,"Whenever I feel down, I watch three things:

1. Game 162 of 2011 MLB regular season

2. Last year's Stanley Cup Game 7

3. Helmet Catch"
nfl,ffa28ai,t3_esec04,1579726420.0,My team was somehow as frustrating to watch for its opposing fans as it was for its own fans.
Seahawks,ff9y7kc,t3_es9t3u,1579724068.0,"I began watching football around 2014, very casually. Since I was living in Toronto at the time, I naturally watched the Bills, so I actually wasn't a Seahawks fan when they won the Super Bowl, though I always have soft hearts for Seattle teams because I'm originally from Vancouver.

Then Bills cancelled their Toronto games the next year I think, and being in AFC East just was no fun for a new fan, so I shifted to Seahawks and Packers (Hawks because of Vancouver and Sherman & Lynch, Packers cuz of Rodgers and I had a friend in Wisconsin). So I decided to really go for the team that wins 2015 NFCCG. We all know what happened.

But I think the SB loss two weeks later really got me into the team. I'm a Toronto Blue Jays and Vancouver Canucks fan, so I just click with teams that have hard time winning it all. That loss also reminded me of the Canucks loss in 2011 to, yes, another Boston team."

NintendoSwitch,ff99nst,t1_ff965rq,1579708026.0,"I'd say that advantage of playing few hours early is not enough to offset the advantage of being a responsible consumer and making an informed choice after a product has been in the market before throwing your money at it, but ok."
Seahawks,ff6wfr6,t3_erzqxa,1579636287.0,"If WAR means the same as baseball, that means he gave us 4 wins above replacement?

Seahawks,ff5c619,t3_ergtvp,1579586904.0,"A legit question from a casual fanhere:

I've been hearing that our pass defense was one of the worst in the league except for forcing turnovers, and that our secondary was always described as ""weak,"" but we have a pro bowl CB and Diggs as safety?"
todayilearned,ff53axu,t1_ff52xl4,1579579065.0,Hopefully we rename 22nd and 33rd avenues after Daniel and Henrik
todayilearned,ff4b0a2,t3_ergva0,1579559423.0,"Gretzky fact is amazing, but so is the second in the list: Sedin twins.

Twins, drafted 2nd and 3rd overall in the same year by the same team (Vancouver Canucks), played not just on the same team their entire career, but also on the same line the entire career, both have over 1000 points, have created most goals together by any duo in the history of the league (other than Gretzky and Kurri), retired together on the same day, their last home game was on of the brothers scoring an OT goal with assist by the other brother, and (most likely) will enter Hall of Fame the same day together.

You make a movie out of their career, people will say it's too unrealistic."
