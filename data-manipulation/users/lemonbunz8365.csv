SuicideWatch,ffvxtce,t1_ffvxejt,1580276606.0,"Death is not the only way out.
First, time heals a lot and that's corny to say but maybe he needs space.
Second, long distance is hard! A lot of girls would have done the same. If he was really ignoring you then that's really wrong, long distance or not. 
Third, a ton of people stalk their ex after a breakup. Social media-wise? Of course.  You want to be with them and see them and know how they are. It's all normal. It's part of being human.
Fourth, you can't let another person leaving determine if you live or die. This is YOUR life. I know how it is to feel like half a heart without them. But you are your own life and you need to protect that.
So even if you don't believe in yourself and feel like no one else does, I sure do!"
SuicideWatch,ffvx91q,t1_ffvwub5,1580276078.0,"I don't agree. I was once a really attached girlfriend too. I carry tremendous guilt everyday for how I hurt him too. But that sounds like he didn't understand what you were going through, or felt helpless and scared. Which isn't your fault! It's okay to mess up- and it happens in relationships a lot because we are learning. It stings, truly. It sucks. And I am so sorry he said he can't forgive you. That is his issue to work within himself. You did your part and I know how terrible breakups are. But don't end your life because you weren't perfect. You are still learning and so am I and that's okay! I'm 2 years younger than you (if you'll be 24 next month if I read that right) so we are learning together. Be gentle with yourself because its okay to hurt and grieve and regret. Let yourself mend and grow"
SuicideWatch,ffvwoj0,t1_ffvwbmj,1580275557.0,"Well, even bad people have hope. And I know you want the hope of being okay. That's why you posted on Reddit. You need support. Bad people are allowed to get better too. I wouldn't turn anyone away who wanted help or the hope of being okay again. I'm not agreeing that you're bad, though"
SuicideWatch,ffvw9gx,t1_ffvw3j6,1580275175.0,We are all human and we all fuck up. Nothing you do can't be forgiven. So be gentle with yourself. Every life is IMPORTANT. Especially yours and I truly believe that
SuicideWatch,ffvw2em,t1_ffvvrv8,1580274998.0,"I'll enjoy it a lot more knowing you are celebrating too. This isn't about me, I just want to relate to you. I am here if you need a friend, or to vent. Don't give up on yourself, you're awesome"
SuicideWatch,ffvvygw,t3_evhlek,1580274899.0,"There is never a good time to end your life. Now is the time to take baby steps towards being who you want to be. If you don't know, that's okay. You are at the age where you discover who you want to be as you grow. Don't take that chance away from yourself. I'm embarrassed of my own life too, and what I can say is be gentle with yourself, even if no one else is. And seek out mini goals to keep you occupied. Little victories here and there. Failure comes with life and it does not mean you are bad. It means you are FIGHTING and TRYING, which is a lot! Not many people try hard anymore. I'm here if you need a friend"
SuicideWatch,ffvvp8p,t3_evi1ao,1580274670.0,"No, it won't work because it won't help you. It won't give you what you're looking for. I lost my boyfriend and a ton of friends this past half year alone. I know what it feels like to feel completely unwanted and undesirable. But if that were the case, I wouldn't be typing this comment to you! Because I care, and we are also birthday buddies because my birthday is in a month too!"
SuicideWatch,ffvvgpm,t3_evi493,1580274461.0,"You can't save everybody, but just reaching out is more than a lot of people would do. You are a good person, don't let the evils of this world take you down. We need good people like you. You never know how someone reacts to your comments on the other side of the screen. You could have so much impact you don't even know about. And I care"
SuicideWatch,ffv4j6h,t1_ffv4euw,1580255498.0,Do you feel like you have nobody? Because you posted on this subreddit and so I figure you just needed somebody to be there for you. To talk you out of doing what you want to do
SuicideWatch,ffv3bby,t1_ffv1l7r,1580254695.0,"Because you are a person who deserves to be alive. Whatever is going on it's not worth ending your life. You are bigger than all the evil in the world and all the problems being thrown your way.

Why do you feel like you want to end things?"
SuicideWatch,ffv0aen,t1_ffuz8st,1580252774.0,"Sure, you are nobody I KNOW. But you matter to me because you are hurting. Every life matters."
SuicideWatch,ffuq8u0,t3_evadzx,1580247243.0,I care if you die today. Please message me if you need a friend or someone to talk to.
SuicideWatch,ffuq5ui,t3_evairh,1580247196.0,I care. And I am here if you need a friend. I care if you die today
SuicideWatch,ffupewa,t3_evbqly,1580246770.0,"Please get up! If you feel no one cares, I care! Go enjoy the sky somewhere safe!!

A few days ago I had a gun pointed to my head. The day before I thought I wanted to be dead. So please, don't do this thing you'll regret the second you can't change it.

Your life has the same importance as everyone. I truly truly care if you die today. 

If you needed someone to tell you to keep going, someone to tell you they care, or just someone at all... I'll be that someone"
Dominos,fft3xvt,t3_ev334p,1580205799.0,The end left me satisfied. Screw people who are rude to those doing a service for them!
Supernatural,ffq2rf3,t3_eueui3,1580117207.0,That's so awesome! The cast we call family is full of great people! Same with the fans:)
Dominos,ffpwoy6,t1_ffpwj9o,1580108690.0,"I totally get where you're coming from, and a lot of people asked me if I was going to stay or leave. I chose to stay because honestly I really enjoy what I do and I love the people that I work with. I don't want one bad person to ruin that for me. I have a lot of new safety measures that I will be following of course, but like I said I totally get where you're coming from"
Dominos,ffpqoym,t3_eudn2m,1580102347.0,Yes! Drivers need to be able to defend themselves so good for this guy!
Dominos,ffeu7b8,t1_ffetu24,1579865721.0,"Exactly what I thought as well about the red flags. Be extra cautious, no ones pizza comes before your safety"
Dominos,ffepqu7,t1_ffeplf8,1579859308.0,Thank you friend! Stay safe
Dominos,ffepi6o,t1_ffepe6n,1579858948.0,"Me too, I pray none of you do either. All night, even now, all I wanted to do was rip the memory from my head. It's still stuck on loop, and I'm hoping I become numb to it after awhile. No one should even have to fear this happening to them"
Dominos,ffepc3k,t1_ffeow0k,1579858687.0,"You should. Even my GM told me last night, Domino's doesn't emphasize enough on driver safety. I promise you, you'd rather be safe than sorry if you ever need to use it. Because I never ever thought I'd be faced with a gun to my head"
Dominos,ffen8kz,t1_ffen1z1,1579855538.0,"True, and after that night, my store started talking about buying every driver pepper spray, so those of us who don't have any defense already can at least have some protection now"
Dominos,ffen19w,t1_ffe9dtj,1579855245.0,"That's just as scary, because anyone could walk into the store during carryout hours. I hope everyone was okay!!"
Dominos,ffemy39,t1_ffejw67,1579855116.0,Why in the world would they take away delivery slips??
Dominos,ffemwxq,t1_ffdz1ny,1579855071.0,"Thats so sketchy, thank God you caught it upfront. I'm glad you guys have good intuition about bad orders"
Dominos,ffdvt74,t1_ffd5mmo,1579830172.0,"Yes, please stay safe I couldn't stand it if I heard on the news that one of you was killed"
Dominos,ffdvrmy,t1_ffdvisg,1579830141.0,"Thats very smart, I will go with that in the future too"
Dominos,ffdvmfv,t1_ffdri40,1579830038.0,"In this situation, I figured it was better to give him the food before he had a chance to hurt me because I asked for money first. I had a feeling and went with it"
Dominos,ffdcf0o,t1_ffdaydv,1579817914.0,"I am super grateful, I love the store and the people I work with! They help make me feel safe"
Dominos,ffd52qq,t1_ffd2b2c,1579813577.0,Good what? Lol
Dominos,ffd43lu,t1_ffd2zu2,1579813034.0,"I hope so too, I really enjoy my job and the people I work with. The kicker is I wasn't even supposed to be working that night. I hope you remember the mistakes I made and are extra careful! You stay safe too:)"
Dominos,ffd159j,t1_ffczzvj,1579811365.0,"I will definitely be taking new safety measures, driving as a girl is scary enough, we don't need the creepy men on top of it lol. I wish I could blacklist the whole street. Because the address did not exist, and I did not know until later"
Dominos,ffd0ubu,t1_ffd0had,1579811197.0,"That just makes your previous comment hilarious. Also I am glad they didn't try violence with you. It IS scary, and I wasn't careful enough that night. Stay safe!"
Dominos,ffd0ohw,t1_ffbr2l5,1579811108.0,I hope you stay safe too friend

Dominos,ffd0dii,t1_ffcxc5z,1579810941.0,"Most definitely, I hope you never have to use it"

Dominos,ffczp89,t1_ffczlcp,1579810567.0,"How scary. The guy I delivered to was perfect about answering, being kind, and I even heard kids in the background."
Dominos,ffcz9k0,t1_ffcz6i7,1579810323.0,Very good point. I will definitely invest in one now.
Dominos,ffcyi34,t1_ffcy5t6,1579809894.0,"True, I will probably start carrying it now"
Dominos,ffcyfko,t1_ffcy7li,1579809854.0,I posted the full story on the Domino's subreddit just now
Dominos,ffcydls,t1_ffbntjq,1579809822.0,The story has been posted
Dominos,ffcu5oh,t1_ffcndht,1579807320.0,"I am not a gun person at all, so I've never had any interest of carrying. I would carry pepper spray if I could. That always made me feel safe in college. Now unfortunately, I can barely look at a gun"
Dominos,ffctm6t,t1_ffc2758,1579807005.0,My GM told me I'm not obligated to come to work and he will cover my shifts if need be. I might go in as an insider until I can try driving again. Everyone has been so kind and understanding towards me. I love my store and the people in it.
Dominos,ffctbuy,t1_ffbosl3,1579806839.0,"Thanks so much. Me too, I would never wish what I experienced on my worst enemy"
Dominos,ffct9rm,t1_ffbuz62,1579806805.0,"The name was Jonathan, and he was new, but the police said his phone number had no history or something? I'm not sure what was up with that. But I gave them a decent description and they started pulling up images showing me people, and they are confident they will find him, thank God"
Dominos,ffct2j6,t1_ffbuf6z,1579806687.0,"I hope so... Its the same street I got food thrown at me. Which also sucks because there are several great customers on that street, but I don't know how I'll ever be able to go back"
Dominos,ffbnz5n,t1_ffbntjq,1579774970.0,"For just the pizza thankfully. So I'm super drained tonight, but I promise once I rest up I can come back and tell the story. I want others to hear so they don't do what I did, or do better than I did and can stay safe"
Dominos,ffbnuwx,t1_ffbnmxa,1579774793.0,It was a customer who was being nice to me and he took the food and I thought he was reaching for money but he pulled a gun
Dominos,ffbmoqa,t1_ffbmjpo,1579773002.0,How awful. Violence all for pizza. Pathetic
Dominos,ffblxaw,t1_ffbllef,1579771828.0,"I hope you stay safe too. People are evil, no one should feel unsafe doing their job!"
Dominos,ffbkpip,t1_ffbkn90,1579769965.0,"I have worried about being shot at least 10 times a day, and my fear almost came true. I would never wish this one anyone and I pray it doesn't happen to you. I'm so glad I'm okay too. Be safe out there"

AmItheAsshole,ff8wzl3,t1_ff8wrr2,1579698832.0,"Luckily I do have a good place on my own lined up in a couple of months. But unfortunately I can't change her, so I'll be distant until I can hang out in my own living room without worrying about crossing anyone's boundaries except my cat's lol"
AmItheAsshole,ff8wbko,t1_ff8w6d6,1579698236.0,I've started wishing for friends who realize I can't be perfect and who are understanding of me when I fail or fall short. Even just one person like that would be a tremendous blessing to me now
AmItheAsshole,ff8w7iy,t1_ff8w2ri,1579698133.0,"Maybe after this, they finally will. I hope. I'd encourage them again but I think I'm gonna keep my distance for awhile lol"
AmItheAsshole,ff8w5hd,t1_ff8uvyg,1579698082.0,"Before I moved in, K told me about her ""irrational worries"" about E and J hanging out in the living room when I wasn't home. She laughed them off but I could tell she still had worries. For some reason now I'm an even bigger threat. I think E is very beautiful, but to be blunt maybe it is the skinny thing. K has told me before she is insecure about that in particular"
AmItheAsshole,ff8vv1s,t1_ff8u9g5,1579697823.0,"From what I understand, they were due for marriage counseling, which i kept trying to encourage, but I don't think they ever went. Too many conflicts and pride between the two to actually go"
AmItheAsshole,ff8vrgz,t1_ff8tg3t,1579697732.0,"I agree. I think avoiding him is drastic, but I feel like I need to be drastic so I can completely avoid this from happening again. Because I am not sure how else to fix this"
AmItheAsshole,ff8vnyh,t1_ff8vju4,1579697643.0,Lol:) definitely something for me to work on
AmItheAsshole,ff8vesc,t1_ff8v4fc,1579697407.0,"I'm used to that from people! I dont like speaking up for myself, I let people walk all over me. So usually they can easily assume I'm always in the wrong for something. I'm trying to change that, but my controlling friends don't like when I stick up for myself:)"
AmItheAsshole,ff8vb7r,t1_ff8v7dg,1579697312.0,Lol:) this sounds weird but but being kind to myself is so difficult right now. The first step would probably be a good therapist
AmItheAsshole,ff8v8ds,t1_ff8uug1,1579697238.0,"We've had tons of issues recently. Personally, I think its because she always has to get her way. I'm not perfect either but we go downhill pretty fast. Luckily I should be in a new place in the next few months"
AmItheAsshole,ff8v5gh,t1_ff8uyy3,1579697161.0,"I'm kind of upset with E, I feel like she assumes bad things about me behind my back, so I will try to bring it up if I can cool down about it. As far as K, it's just another person who expects too much out of me, I don't know what's right and wrong anymore"
AmItheAsshole,ff8v0y8,t1_ff8uyfy,1579697039.0,"I am in therapy, but I'm thinking about finding a new one. I don't think my current one is helping. Hopefully I get help soon because this fiasco pushed me further down a dark place"
AmItheAsshole,ff8uwpa,t1_ff8ut3a,1579696923.0,I'm pretty sure everyone knows she got upset with how upset I was at being told I can't hang out or text J anymore. They probably think I'm gross. I suppose its easier to view me as NTA from an outside view
AmItheAsshole,ff8ut95,t1_ff8ubb8,1579696830.0,I agree. Some of it is pride too I think
AmItheAsshole,ff8us11,t1_ff8uou3,1579696797.0,"J and K don't see eye to eye on J and I's friendship. He is chill towards me, but I sometimes think K would rather J and I werent friends at all"
AmItheAsshole,ff8uo1o,t1_ff8uho1,1579696692.0,"I carry constant guilt, and I feel like I hurt people without meaning to a lot. I think all our mutual friends blame me for what she did too. She told me it wasn't my fault, but I think she's the only one who thinks that"
AmItheAsshole,ff8ubsz,t1_ff8tw5w,1579696356.0,"A lot of friends came to support her after she went home last night, and I got home after everyone and no one said a single word to me. I know they all blame me and think I'm awful. It crushes me"
AmItheAsshole,ff8u8y5,t1_ff8tx2c,1579696277.0,"It's personal and probably wrong of me to say, but self harm. I struggle with it too. But I felt like I was the reason when she told me she was getting stitches and I felt horrible. Responsible for more pain. I never wanted to do anything bad"
AmItheAsshole,ff8u287,t1_ff8tle0,1579696087.0,Yeah its super hard to be friends with her must of the time
AmItheAsshole,ff8u1gj,t1_ff8tvzz,1579696065.0,That's what I thought and it's okay to be insecure but apparently she has constant nightmares about him cheating on her when he never has. She's never even been cheated on at all
AmItheAsshole,ff8tyyt,t1_ff8trt6,1579695996.0,I figured E thought it was inappropriate because her schedule is completely different from ours so 2am might be weird for her. K kept telling me how I hang out with him all the time but I was truly confused since I had time to hang out with him maybe twice that week. Watching TV every time
AmItheAsshole,ff8tuin,t1_ff8tqnu,1579695868.0,"I've tried to but she thinks I'm subconsciously flirting. Just because we laugh at stupid jokes we come up with. I don't ever touch him or look at him weird. It makes me feel awful, like I'm being a bad person I never intended to be"
AmItheAsshole,ff8tmdr,t1_ff8t9zd,1579695631.0,This is how I feel about it to a T. But she made me feel like a homewrecker and I got so upset that I had to get another opinion

AmItheAsshole,ff8ti04,t1_ff8tdna,1579695502.0,"I do, but I haven't ever tried to keep it a secret. The living room is very open right next to the door that anyone could walk into. She reads his phone too. So I know we couldn't keep any secret if we had one"

AmItheAsshole,ff8tac7,t1_ff8t2u3,1579695273.0,"E has a different schedule so she probably thought 2am was weird. And K is 19 years old, so there's only so much adult I can try to talk. We have talked before though"
