pittsburgh,ffhz121,t1_ffgtio3,1579959858.0,Quite a common setup for sex traffickers
AskReddit,ffd8ec9,t1_ffcl2fz,1579815426.0,"“I’ll put something down for 5 seconds”

Sounds like you’re causing your own problem. Have a designated place for these things and put them there. Easy fix."
AskReddit,ffd5f1t,t1_ffd3xt1,1579813768.0,You can absolutely date for a relationship and connect enough to have sex in the first date. The two are not mutually exclusive.
mildlyinteresting,ffd3j38,t1_ffc7dws,1579812713.0,"I’m a HUGE Jeremy Wade fan. He easily hits my tops 3 people I’d like to meet, dead or alive. I went to my city zoo a few years ago and saw one of these and a couple of red tail catfish in a section of the aquarium, and I almost started crying, I was so excited!"
mildlyinteresting,ffd2j79,t1_ffc27n6,1579812145.0,They specifically market these for offices and what not. Just makes it easier for employees to know when they need replaced. Funny thing is that I’m looking at the same box in my office and never noticed that it’s branded as “Kleenex professional”.
AskReddit,ffcxudi,t1_ffcg2qc,1579809516.0,Wow. Guilt is not a requirement of suicide. Depression is. You don’t have to have raped children to commit suicide and your comment is just gross.
funny,ffa7par,t1_ffa0wo2,1579729499.0,"The cat is behaving like this for a reason, so no, don’t just close the door. The cat needs taken to a vet."

funny,ffa1gju,t1_ff9zxi1,1579725971.0,"It’s not like they just have to be able to spell the words out of thin air. They get a list ahead of time and memorize them. If you fail a spelling test, you didn’t study."
AnimalsBeingJerks,ffa14zk,t1_ff92u33,1579725784.0,The autonomic fight or flight response of seeing another dog in the house forced “stupid” doggo to attack. Easily preventable by actually stupid people who seemed to be expecting a reaction or wouldn’t have been filming.
funny,ffa0jfu,t1_ff9lo1k,1579725431.0,An adult had to have put him up there to begin with.
funny,ffa0h9s,t1_ff9km0p,1579725396.0,You are absolutely correct. There is no way that kid got up there by himself.
cats,ff9ztpp,t1_ff8jajx,1579725013.0,The mouse could also be tired or injured. Many cats will “play” with mice for quite a while before finally deciding to kill them.
NatureIsFuckingLit,ff7aidw,t1_ff6ojjm,1579644661.0,It makes larger racks that much more impressive when you know they were grown in one season.
NatureIsFuckingLit,ff7aezz,t1_ff777q1,1579644584.0,Have you ever walked through the woods? My brother has boxes and boxes of dropped antlers from the woods. Maybe you just live in an area where there are already people who find them before you get a chance to see them. I know a lot of people who go on hikes just for this purpose when the rut is over.

pittsburgh,ff4jaaz,t1_ff4hpcu,1579564958.0,"You’re not wrong, the camera footage exists and will tell the 100% truth regardless of how it went."
pittsburgh,ff4dkrr,t1_ff4csvf,1579561085.0,"I have a lot of experience with thrift stores and Red, White, and Blue is the only one I have ever been in that didn’t have a fitting room, including mom and pop type places. (Not saying they don’t exist, this is just my experience) It’s just kind of an expectation if you’re selling clothes. I’ve even been to open air flea markets where venders provided portable shower tents as fitting rooms. At the very least, have a return policy so people can bring them back if they don’t fit, especially if you are going to charge the high prices that R,W, and B charges."
funny,ff4ccp7,t1_ff415zs,1579560278.0,We had a 15 minute policy in our dorm. 15 minutes after the cycle finishes and your clothes were going in the trash. It was always funny watching people pull their soaked clothes out of a lint-filled trash can.
pittsburgh,ff4bgkr,t1_ff4b9hn,1579559709.0,"Ugh. I quit going a couple of years ago after taking an entire trash bag of things to goodwill that I bought at Red, White, and Blue that didn’t fit or just didn’t look good, and I never wore. Seeing that would piss me off though, I’ve gotten them new with tags for cheaper than that on eBay."
pittsburgh,ff4as64,t1_ff49vk4,1579559280.0,"My biggest issue with red, white, and blue is no fitting rooms and no return policy. Pick one, either let people try the shit on, or give them their money back when it doesn’t fit."
AnimalsBeingBros,ff4a8px,t1_ff3ekzr,1579558940.0,"I’m glad this story had a positive outcome. I’m always a voice for misunderstood cats and I hate so much when people say they have a mean cat, but never take them to the vet to get checked out. You would be mean if you were in pain all of the time also. This is also Jackson Galaxy first step when dealing with “mean” cats."
AskReddit,ff49mw1,t1_ff48svp,1579558559.0,"Yeah, we go through a lot of the same issues. I actually noticed in my own comment, I changed from saying custodian to maintenance, and that’s exactly what my company is trying to do. They want guys who have been paid a few bucks an hour to just clean for years to now start completing maintenance and repairs that usually would be the responsibility of people making 2-3 times their hourly rate for no additional pay, while still getting their normal cleaning taken care of. Company-wide meetings have been rough for the last 2 years. I’m just hoping no one gets hurts at this point."
AskReddit,ff48rx0,t1_ff2v8qm,1579558019.0,A lot more men secretly paint their toenails and wear feminine underwear than what people realize. I’m a woman and I find it to just be so sexist. Let men enjoy pretty things if they want to. My brother let his girlfriend paint his bright red for fun when he was in high school. The funny part is when he forgot about it and went on a swimming outing with her whole family the next day.  Many laughs were had.
AskReddit,ff483ir,t1_ff3xfyd,1579557594.0,"Funny story. The president and owner of my company was onsite one day and he’s very particular about aesthetics. It was a snowy day so the custodian made sure he was mopping the front lobby periodically, both for safety purposes of having a wet floor, but also because dried salt looks terrible. Toward the afternoon the owner made a snarky comment, “Every time I’m in this office, you’re mopping the same spot, don’t you actually do anything else?” Maintenance guy rage quit on the spot after 13 years with the company. Sadly, the owner is still oblivious that he even said or did anything that would be questionable in any way."
pics,ff4275j,t1_ff41y2a,1579553931.0,"You can change culture, but there will always be a percentage of issues. It’s all beside the point anyway. No woman should have her rights to bodily autonomy taken for any reason and most pro-life arguments are just veiled (sometimes quite obvious) ways to tell women what they can and can’t do."
pics,ff41ti7,t1_ff41hg2,1579553697.0,"Without getting into arguing over what’s scientifically accurate as opposed to opinions, it’s one death, rather than two. The abortion is saving the life of the mother to prevent the “death” of both the mother *and* the fetus. One of these options should clearly be preferable to the other and anyone who can’t see that has a skewed perspective somewhere."
AnimalsBeingBros,ff3yahs,t1_ff3r2jo,1579551496.0,"I’m glad the guy called, but that had to have been a nerve racking calling to get. So glad she’s home."
