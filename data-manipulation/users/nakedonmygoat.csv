It wasn't until we moved that we found that the dust ruffle on the sofa was completely destroyed, as was the carpet, which had been clawed and chewed down to the baseboard.

Funny thing was that she knew she would be put in the cage for that behavior, so when she heard us coming home with those big ears of hers, she got into loaf position on the sofa or in the middle of the room and acted innocent. We never suspected a thing, since who goes looking behind their sofa?

Whatever you do, don't feel ashamed. One of the most brilliant men I ever knew killed himself because he couldn't handle the depression, the anxiety and the shame. The first two weren't his fault. The third was. Don't let that be you. Depression warps your thinking, and I say that as someone who struggles with it too. 

My suggestion is to make a promise to yourself that you'll do at least one positive act each day and do no intentional negative acts unless you know for sure that you're in a better mental place and aren't being mind-warped by your own brain. This is what keeps me going and I hope it helps."

HR isn't usually the final decision-maker as to who gets hired. We just confirm that the applicants meet the minimum qualifications and then we pass their information along. If anyone can influence your hire by direct communication of some kind, it's the actual hiring department. We have had cases where a department wanted to hire someone whose resume might not otherwise have made the cut, but at the department's request, we sent it on through.

Not only is restaurant cooking very different from cooking for friends and family, but it's a very demanding business where most new restaurants take a minimum of six months just to break even, if they ever do. 

People who have never worked in a restaurant have this starry-eyed notion that it's all about cooking up delicious meals in a spacious kitchen and chatting with grateful customers. Instead, it's about long hours in a cramped, hot kitchen, then even more in a tiny office figuring out the bills, wondering all the while who on your staff is stealing from you.

Even though my father was living in a very rural area, I never worried for him while his brothers remained healthy because I knew they saw each other every day and had each others' backs.

AskReddit,febs1zu,t1_febi10z,1578962024.0,">I can understand the dress code requiring skirts not be too short

I can understand it too, and I agree. But administration can be sort of arbitrary with that one.

I was a high school freshman in 1981 and I read the school handbook cover to cover, like the dutiful geek I was raised to be. The female dress code said that ""skirts shall be no shorter than mid-thigh."" Girls hadn't worn miniskirts after the mid-70s or so, but shorter skirts had a brief comeback in 1982 and all of a sudden girls were being sent home to change if the hem of their skirt didn't touch the floor when they kneeled. 

It was all fine and good to say ""no shorter than mid-thigh"" when short skirts were out of style, I guess, and they didn't think the girls would wear them.."

This set is solid silver, not plated, and I really thought it would be worth more, but as it turns out, everyone else out there is about as interested in fancy silver forks as I am, meaning not interested at all."

Don't fight with a friend, roommate, or SO over something petty. Ask for what you would like them to do differently, but if it doesn't happen, find another way. Save the big guns for when it really matters, and you'll be taken far more seriously.

For example, I have dark hair. My spouse uses dark towels and hangs them over the shower curtain exactly behind where I need to stand to comb my hair in the mirror. I asked a few times not to put the towels there because dark hair + dark towel means I can't see if my hair is sticking up. The towels kept being put there. But hey, it's not hard to move a towel, so I move it myself. I'm not going to risk my credibility on something truly important by getting pissy over something that's really not that big a deal."
