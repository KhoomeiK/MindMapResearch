I just don't care whether it's a Stark thing or dragon glass or anything else until it's in a book or even explained by GRRM, personally.

Not perfect, though. For some reason, a lot of the j-pop I listen to will have an official music video, but nothing submitted for an audio only stream, and it will default to a shitty cover artist. Have to then force it to play a music video for that one. It also loves to switch between audio only and mv seemingly at will.

You *are* out here trying to tell people they're wrong for caring more about the name they've known and seen often for decades more than some unknown people that they've never had any contact with it any sort.
