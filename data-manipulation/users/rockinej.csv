But what really helped me accept that he's gone is watching videos of him and crying it out. I didn't want his memory to die and I'd always tell stories of him until eventually it became more joyful than upsetting. Don't be afraid to remember him and speak about him as though he's still here, you may be in denial for a while and grief takes time but if you try to speed up the process and move on itlll only take longer. I'm so sorry for your loss and I wish you the best :)"
