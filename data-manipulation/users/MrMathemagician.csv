unpopularopinion,ff6a9tl,t3_ervol2,1579622776.0,"This is not unpopular. This is commonly voiced. A lot of people understand that there is some degree of self confidence that is needed to be a normal functioning human being.

However, if your friend is having issues like this one, you shouldn’t bring it up with reddit. You should probably tell them as it is often difficult to figure these things out alone."

But like many other smart mathematicians throughout history, he choose to put his intelligence in other fields to actually make money instead.
