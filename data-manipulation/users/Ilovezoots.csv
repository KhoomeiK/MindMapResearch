If you end up loving it, which you probably will, I recommend waiting around 6/8 weeks between rolls so that it doesn’t fuck your serotonin up :-)"
MDMA,ffcmem2,t3_eswnp8,1579802540.0,"Take between 50-100mg, I also wouldn’t recommend drinking alcohol on your first try. Unless you’ve directly seen it be tested, then it needs testing, regardless of what a friend says. 

If you take it and don’t feel anything after a few hours DO NOT redose it, it’s how people die. 

Drink water but not ridiculous amounts like bottle after bottle. 

I’d also recommend trying it in a private setting before going to do a club to try it. Anything ive ever experimented with has been in the comfort of my own home, if I’m comfortable with it I then take it out in the club or nights out etc.

Most importantly, relax, take it easy, and enjoy the trip. The first roll I ever did was the greatest experience! Enjoy :)"

They will run through a budget with you (so that they can take as much as they can) all you need to do is lie about monthly expenditure (housing, food, travel etc) and leave yourself just a little bit left, as this is the figure they will request on a monthly basis. 

E.g. if you earn $2500 pcm, lie on your expenses that you spend $2400 pcm and they will ask for the extra $100. They also won’t ask for evidence of these costs.
