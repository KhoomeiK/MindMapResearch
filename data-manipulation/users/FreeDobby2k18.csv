relationships,ffedl7d,t1_ffebuip,1579844110.0,"To me, telling your wife, who is the most important person in your life and won’t tell anybody =\= “outing her”. That being said, he easily could have said “don’t worry, she is in a relationship,” without outing her."

FundieSnark,fek12bk,t1_feif023,1579190328.0,"Actually, even Kristen has said that Bethany's singleness was similar to her infertility and they were going through a similar thing. Sounds really weird to us, but I guess in their community it feels that way."
relationship_advice,fej0s1e,t3_epd6se,1579152819.0,"Pretty normal and healthy, because I recognized their relationship as unhealthy. Honestly, this is in part due to the fact that I used Tumblr at a young age. (Yeah I know that sounds odd, bear with me.) On Tumblr, there are a lot of popular posts explaining what the red flags of an unhealthy relationship are and how to avoid them. Stuff like, ""It's not okay if your partner calls you names, it's not okay if your partner controls what you wear, etc."" So before my first relationship, I knew what toxic looked like, and I knew how to avoid it. That being said, I upbringing has caused me to have depression, which can negatively impact my relationships. So honestly the toxicity in my relationships comes from me. But I'm working on it."

depression,fdmng7q,t3_em6kpr,1578556761.0,"Number 2 really hits home for me. I've been depressed for maybe 9 or so years, and it's always been something or other. When I was young it was family issues and bullying, in high school it evolved into body dysmorphia. Today it's grades and career as well.

Who here is saying snark posts are going overboard and then turning around and fawning over the bigots? I am so confused.

All I am saying is that our response to bigots who send harmful messages for young girls shouldn't be another set of harmful messages for young girls. Plain and simple."
FundieSnark,fcg1g0j,t1_fccorkv,1577635607.0,"I'm not so concerned about Girl defined, but about OTHER young girls who might see us snarking on lips and noses and get the idea that there is something inherently bad with their features like I did. I will participate because I developed body dysmorphia when I was in high school and stuff like this fueled it. I was also slut shamed for the length of my skirts, the way Kristen and Bethany slut shame their followers. The message about physical features being ugly was as damaging as the messages about my skirts being too short. I want to be better than Kristen and Bethany."
FundieSnark,fcconqx,t1_fcbv1r8,1577600830.0,"Yeah, I feel like they're more like the standard obnoxious evangelicals that a lot of people know, not quite fundie. They're fine with women having careers and dressing ""immodestly."" Also Cole's mom is, well, the opposite of fundie."
FundieSnark,fcbtkfj,t1_fcb5974,1577590816.0,"Allow me to offer an alternate perspective. In my high school years, due to bullying from peers, I suffered from body dysmorphic disorder. I was slut shamed for the length of my skirts, which was really hurtful. I was also bullied for physical features that I had no control over. My ""friends"" would mock other girls for features they couldn't control, like their nose, lips, face, arms, body, etc. This led to me believing that looking a certain way made me inherently bad, ugly, and disgusting. 

I think that when we mock Bethany and Kristen's faces, we send the message to young girls that their is something wrong with having a big nose or thin lips, and that they should be ashamed of having such features. 

For me at least, these messages were equally harming to the slut shaming messages that Bethany and Kristen sent out to young women. I think we can do better than that."
FundieSnark,fcbqg8r,t1_fcb1r2t,1577589834.0,"I appreciate your perspective, however putting down aspects of their appearance that they have no control over is destructive. All it does is fuel their martyr complex while sending the message that there is something bad or wrong with having a big nose or thin lips, which is not true."
FundieSnark,fcaxk7r,t1_fc8eifm,1577578597.0,"I didn't get these Pinterest recommendations until after I visited GD. It's based on your cookies, they don't recommend these to all women in their 20's."
FundieSnark,fcawxs3,t1_fc9ikxm,1577578240.0,"To be fair, if you just read some of the posts on this sub, a lot of the content here is personal attacks and legitimately hating them and not just their beliefs. People snark on Bethany's nose and wedding ring and Kristen's skin and eyebrows. That has nothing to do with their beliefs.

Honestly, I really wish people realized that their appearances are not the problem, their views are the problem."

FundieSnark,fc5uxm5,t1_fc4wzzl,1577466455.0,"I don't think it's just white men. I'm south Asian and purity shows up a lot in our culture and religions too. However, in South Asian culture, chastity is not the only kind of purity. Vegetarianism, a pure diet, is also very important, and physical cleanliness is very important too. For example, when you go to a temple, you have to take your shoes off and clean your feet before you enter."
