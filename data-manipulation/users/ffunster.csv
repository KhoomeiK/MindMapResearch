comedyheaven,ffemaso,t3_et2oo5,1579854206.0,yes because why would you ASSUME shark fin soup is just imitation made with gelatin?! omg what an idiot for thinking shark fin soup was shark fin soup!!!
lifehacks,ffelgdm,t3_esvnrx,1579853067.0,i fucking loved my blackberry. kinda still want one.
AlteredManholes,ffefwa1,t1_ffefudb,1579846448.0,ok maybe he will get a job at the gap if he writes a strong cover letter. fair enough.
AlteredManholes,ffeftk5,t1_ffefrh1,1579846369.0,but i’m not wrong.
mildlyinteresting,ffefc5l,t3_eszb05,1579845860.0,i can’t imagine this takes more than 3 seconds to realize. posting like it was some wild discovery.
AlteredManholes,ffeaja2,t3_espbzt,1579841304.0,this guy is overrated and makes the same posts over and over. and wants people to pay 25$ for it. can someone tell him to get a job? dudes gonna be 40 and seeking his first real job at old navy.
agedlikemilk,ffcbreb,t1_ffcbcbz,1579796024.0,for the iphone...... they changed once’s. clearly i wasn’t talking about every single device. and yea the laptop charges looked different but there were actually only like 2 different ones beside usb c.
agedlikemilk,ffc3085,t1_ffc1tl1,1579790270.0,i don’t disagree i just am not so obscenely passionate about it. i genuinely don’t care or see why it’s a big deal but the circle jerk will happen. i’ve never once been inconvenienced by my phones charging cord. i just... do not care.
agedlikemilk,ffbwwk5,t1_ffbwnvq,1579785430.0,"ok and the issue with that is...? you act like people only have 1 cable allowance. you definitely don’t use 1 cable for everything, i’m sure you and everyone else has more than 1 usb cord. idiots act like that lightening cable is so burdensome and unwieldy because it’s DIFFERENT. also love how you ignored the fact that it’s an amazing cable and port. maybe that’s why it’s different! whoa. and i’ll add this little tidbit. at work if i say “does anyone have a usb charger” i get “yea but which kind?” not the case if i say “hey does anyone have an iphone charger?”"
DarkHumorAndMemes,ffbwom8,t3_essau5,1579785235.0,this entered the realm of “trying too hard to be edgy.” the abortion clinic part added nothing beside trying to make it seem super edge.
DarkHumorAndMemes,ffbwg2y,t3_esqx99,1579785024.0,looks like the exact kind of guy that would have a bandage fuck machine rover.
agedlikemilk,ffbw8yk,t1_ffbvyfr,1579784845.0,probably/definitely not all using the same usb... but who cares? lightening cable is great. the port is basically impossible to damage and the charger actually stays in. i can’t imagine being so upset over the fact that the most popular phone in the world has its own cable.
agedlikemilk,ffbvd31,t1_ffbukg3,1579784024.0,"you must have read that completely wrong. phones that use usb charging have changed many many times and inconsistently. anyone with a working iphone (ie from the last 8 years) can use the same charger. definitely not the case for phones using usb. and as far as laptop chargers, go to any public place/library and see if you can borrow a charger for a random windows laptop... not gonna happen. they are almost always unique whether it’s a 1mm diameter different or length or whatever. i’ve seen pc/android users with literal buckets of cables and definitely not the case with apple users so i’m not even sure what your made up issue is about “BUT ITS PROPRIETARY.” so... i can reuse the same cables for new phones and computers? awesome. that’s not wasteful."
agedlikemilk,ffbuc1b,t1_ffbtzw2,1579783022.0,"their laptops had maybe 3 different cables over the last 14 years. different shapes but exact same connection. now usb. and almost no laptops have ever had universal charging cables. and the usb port on phones has changed more times, and inconsistently."
DarkHumorAndMemes,ffbtho4,t1_fe5llf1,1579782162.0,that’s because republicans are actually snowflakes? goes to dark humor sub. gets triggered by libs. small dick energy with this one.
agedlikemilk,ffbswv9,t1_ffbqlpg,1579781545.0,they changed the cable exactly once in 13 years...
ThatsInsane,ff8pql7,t3_ervt12,1579690778.0,this is some serious psychopath shit. i can’t imagine deriving enjoyment from watching animals get thrown into water and struggling before being killed. scumbag.
askgaybros,ff8omw6,t1_ff86pxj,1579689156.0,you just described what i said is more of a fantasy and less how things would likely play out. especially with gay dudes you know that fantasy role play would be fun for like 4 months max.
GapingGuys,ff83lf2,t3_es0xq5,1579665077.0,he’s 100% acting. i’m sure it feels good but calm the fuck down. maybe 80% acting.
askgaybros,ff83c1e,t3_eryv15,1579664881.0,fill you up? with what? there’s a reason a stereotype exists about married couples never having sex. this is an old tv trope and anyone who is actually in the situation generally hates their lives because their is such a fucked up power disparity/dependence issue resulting in non-stop conflict. you’re imagining a literal fiction.
askgaybros,ff834sn,t1_ff7t2ov,1579664730.0,who pays for literally everything...
AlteredManholes,ff7l9fj,t1_ff7kz9o,1579652232.0,it’s in the title bud. and thank you.
AlteredManholes,ff6llre,t3_erqoy5,1579629809.0,i want to see it INSIDE!
CumFromAnal,ff5mtjf,t3_eq0a5e,1579600760.0,is it really that easy to cum with one of these? and when’s the last time you came from jerking?
MenWithToys,ff5lxqq,t3_ermz8q,1579599397.0,you had so many more vids on your page. where did they all go? your hole is one of my absolutely favorites.
TwoXChromosomes,ff56r6r,t3_erji6d,1579581841.0,month?
