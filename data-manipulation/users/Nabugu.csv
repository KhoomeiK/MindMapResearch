AskReddit,fejutt4,t3_epduqa,1579186360.0,"Machine learning. You don’t actually need a full blown degree to use those algorithms if you have some basic Python notions. Same difference as with you using a washing machine vs. building one. I’d say any kind of slightly nerdy person can do it. You just need to know what kind of clothes to put in (and how to pre-wash it a little), and which buttons to push. Tons of ressources on the web."
