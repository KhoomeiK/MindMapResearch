AskReddit,ff6iqfq,t3_erxxcm,1579628064.0,I tell people what to do but they don't do it. I have no decision making power but I still get blamed for the things that other people refuse to do. It is very fulfilling
unpopularopinion,ff6i723,t3_erx5tt,1579627738.0,"My parents bend over backwards to make it work. They divorced when I was 16. I wish that they divorced when it was time (around the time that I was conceived, or maybe they should not have been together at all) but the emotional strain their relationship had on me and my sisters damaged us. Their divorce came as an release. I really think that them being separated would have left us less damaged.
I do think you should work hard in a relationship and not give up that easily, especially when there are kids involved. But you have to keep your kids best interest at hart and sometimes that is getting divorced"

dating_advice,fckg3eu,t3_eho8d2,1577724548.0,"As someone who has been on the other end of this please do not go to her house. She asked for space, so give her space. Also keep in mind that you broke a trust and that is really hard (or not even possible) to get back. But do not force your need for fixing things ahead of hear needs. Just give her space and if she wants she will contact you. If you want to apoligize please do that later on because it will not fix what you did"
