On 1 December 1934, the Air Ministry issued contract AM 361140/34, providing £10,000 for the construction of Mitchell's improved Type 300, design.[11] On 3 January 1935, they formalised the contract with a new specification, F10/35, written around the aircraft.[12] In April 1935, the armament was changed from two .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns in each wing to four .303 in (7.7 mm) Brownings,[13] following a recommendation by Squadron Leader Ralph Sorley of the Operational Requirements section at the Air Ministry.[14]"
