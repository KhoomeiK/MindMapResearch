You literally just did exactly what they do, some one disagreed with your view and the violent actions of a terrorist group and you call them a fascist.

madlads,fff0gpz,t1_ffez81r,1579872237.0,"So, quick fact as it pertains to this.

Homosexuality has actually be found in other animals in nature, there is actually some evidences to suggest homosexuality is a natural form of population control as in area a of dense population homosexuality is found to be more common place per capa. 

The sciences is still being studied but so far What a been found is that that homosexuality and everything related to it is entirely natural.

If I recall there are even homosexual animals who have raised members of their species when the parents were lost without issue.

Another fact is you do not have to be a birth parent to have parental instincts towards some one, many couples who have adopted show the same level of paternal behaviors towards the adopted child as they do to couples who were born to the parents.

Humans can form these bonds very easily, heck we form them with inanimate objects we use regularly as well as towards pets, how many stories are there of some one running into a burning building to save their dog and panicking like a parent when that dog isn't breathing and the reaction to the loss of that dog as if a member of their family died.

We are designed to care for things as a species and form familial bonds whether we are blood related or not makes no difference to general human behavior.

Obviously there are exceptions to the rule since humans are complicated, this is just the overall human behavior towards things around us."

""The story of the batch plant also goes back to 1992, three years after Heemeyer had moved to the area. Heemeyer bought his two acres from the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency set up to handle the assets of failed savings and loan institutions. He bought the two acres for $42,000 but later agreed to sell it to the Docheff family, which wanted the property for a concrete batch plant, for $250,000. They agreed, but then he wanted $375,000 and at some later point wanted a deal worth approximately $1 million. All of this was well before the rezoning proposal hit town hall.""


He was offered money for his property of which he agreed to, then demanded larger and larger amounts.


""Meanwhile, early defenders of Heemeyer contended he made a point of not hurting anybody during his bulldozer rampage. But the sheriff’s department argues that the fact nobody got hurt was more luck than intent. He fired many bullets from his semi-automatic rifle at Cody Docheff when Docheff tried to stop the assault on his concrete batch plant by using a front-end loader. Later, Heemeyer fired on two state troopers before they had fired.


Heemeyer also fired 15 bullets from his .50-BMG rifle at power transformers and propane tanks. “Had these tanks ruptured and exploded, anyone within one-half mile of the explosion could have been endangered,” said the sheriff’s department. That included 12 police officers and residents of a senior citizens complex.


As well, the sheriff notes that 11 of the 13 buildings that Heemeyer bulldozed were occupied until just moments before the destruction. At the town library, for example, a children’s program was in progress when the incident began.""


Let's see trying to make propane tanks explode endangering lives of everyone within half a mile, trying to murder senior citizens and children and guy trying to defend his property. Real heroic.


""First, he rammed the home of the mayor and the town hall and library. Then, he set out more randomly to avenge the wrongs he had perceived. In the case of the local newspaper, the Sky Hi News, the editor who had always run his letters of complaint ran out the back door as Heemeyer’s bulldozer crashed through the front.""


Ah yes the news paper that treated him rather fairly, always ran his letters and didn't deny him a voice. You can just see how they needed to be punished and almost murdered.


“God blessed me in advance for the task that I am about to undertake. It is my duty. God has asked me to do this. It’s a cross that I am going to carry and I’m carrying it in God’s name""


And let's not forget he was on a mission from god! Truly a hero if God himself chose him to go on this rampage and spoke to him.


This man was a deranged psychopath who through blind luck failed to kill anyone.


He target the home of a long dead man for revenge, enderged senior citizens and children and actively tried to blow up the town endangering many lives.

Wanna criticise the FBI? Bring up the fact they spy on journal and rival politicians in the last 5 years. Something that actually reflect what the modern version of it is doing.

The image OP posted is of the FBI trying to honor MLK, something it never would have done in the 60s, and some one bringing up the 60s version as if it's exactly the same.

You say I am attacking a straw man when I am litterally responding to exactly what was posted.

Tell me, should the US government be treated as if they still condone slavery simple because they used to centuries ago?

If you did something as a teenage, let's say shop lifted, should you be treated as a shoplifter when you are 50 years old? Or should you be treated as the person you are now and not what you were decades ago?


The FBI should be held accountable for what they do, but the people involved 60 years ago are all dead now so it doesn't mean much to dig up the past.

Actually bring up somwthi ng modern they do that is relevant to what they are now and critise them.

Or you can sit here and attack me for addressing what OP's meme outright says and the comment I actually spoke on which said none of what you said in the slightest and pretending you know anything about me such as the fact I don't fully trust the government, but it's for things they've actually done in my time not the time of long dead people."

I'm not saying dumb as in booksmart I am meaning he was actually dumb in the low IQ side.

Being a former marine doesn't have anything to do with intelligence and avoiding a few cops here and there does not equate to a massive manhunt with roadblocks being everywhere and searches going on around the clock across the state.

Then just finding him just sitting in a motel room in a city having access to a large sum of money from no where is another thing that makes it suspicious.

Ontop of that Rey was dumb as a door nail and yet managed to avoid police for months with ease lole a mastermind.

There are other aspects that are suspicious or could easily be lied about back then which is why people don't think the offical report is truthful as well as the FBI was doing a lot of shady things back then.
