videos,feejfy4,t1_feeic00,1579034979.0,"Under that definition he would have to have taken an action or made a statement to mislead her. So his lawyer would probably debate that he didn't do anything to mislead her (maybe he did but he didn't say anything in the video that indicates he took action to mislead her).
Being naked and reciprocating sexual advances is not impersonating a nationally famous comedian, sorry.

And you're right, if he actually did commit rape by deception it's rape regardless if there's a conviction but I'm saying I'm not sure from his account alone that he committed such a crime."
videos,feeh55g,t1_feecprc,1579033652.0,"Why are we assuming she had good reason to believe it was Mencia? That's where I think this is wrong and she didnt have good/any reason to believe such a thing and the rape allegation may be misplaced.

And I don't want to argue, I just think there is room for interpretation here and I'm curious as to how people with different perspective than me  (such as yourself) see it, so thank you :) I just want a discussion."

videos,fee7isf,t1_fee6xjg,1579028007.0,"If you start having sex with one person and then they pull a switcheroo that's rape ofc, no objection.
It's not clear to me that happened though, like he said Mencia has a wife so I don't think he engaged in any sexual acts with the girl prior to the other guy.
Seems like she started having sex with someone she thought was Mencia (even though she had no reason to believe so) and then stopped once she realized her fuckup."
videos,fee79aq,t1_fee58na,1579027852.0,"I guess my problem is it seems like she consented to fucking a random body in a dark room, and when she stopped consenting the sex ended.
I don't see it as a problem if he went into the dark room and let her make any assumptions she wanted. Even if she gave consent with really shitty information on her side- that's her choice. No one forced her to give consent and no one duped her into thinking a midget (dwarf?) was Mencia.
Unless she started having sex with Mencia and then they did a switcheroo. That's rape."
videos,fee6ruq,t1_fee5kck,1579027567.0,"Doesn't seem right to call letting someone fuck a random body in a dark room rape.
Like if someone tells me ""ScarJo is in the next room and wants to have sex with you"" and I go in there and it's pitch black and I just start fucking whoever is in there- I consented to sex with an unknown person. It doesn't matter who I thought or hoped it was, I consented until I didn't."

Sanders has been calling for an end to US involvement since before March 2018 when he helped invoke the War Powers Act (that Trump vetoed) to get us out.

As for why the Dems were opposed to Trumps plan to withdraw- it was in their eyes too hasty and left the area and our allies completely undefended which isn't the ideal way to withdraw.
Further- arguing for maintaining a troop population is much different than supporting a 3,000 troop increase, which is happening in Iraq as a result of Soleimanis assassination."
