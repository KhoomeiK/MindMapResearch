Showerthoughts,ffj0pe0,t1_ffi0hmn,1579987448.0,So is sleeping by the same logic. Can you be sure you are the same person who went to bed last night? Or did your brain make a perfect copy of you that overwrote the original when you woke up?
AskReddit,ffbkayu,t1_ffaqsq7,1579769371.0,"It sounds like the plan was to choke out Netflix by outspending them. Offer a better service for less, and just operate at a loss until Netflix runs out of money. The problem is that they did it like five years too late.

Better yet, they should have just bought them when they had the chance."
todayilearned,fewksjz,t1_fept7ed,1579412939.0,"Yeah exactly, like I don't agree with it, but at least the whole resurrectionist thing is just rational self interest provided you buy the religious aspect, and not pure spite."
todayilearned,felyvxy,t1_felgxhh,1579234498.0,"Honestly, I would sooner accept the argument of ""I want all my organs intact so when Jesus comes back I'll be resurrected whole"" over ""I just don't want an addict having my organs because reasons"". At least I can follow the logic on that first one."
AskReddit,fekkr3e,t1_feizohq,1579202090.0,"When I was initially introduced to the growing trend of low yield or tactical weapons making a comeback, the US was still largely focused on maintaining the pre-existing arsenal."
AskReddit,fei83go,t1_fei6yi2,1579132385.0,"What part? Upon further research, it seems I had missed some recent developments on the US side. So my statement that the US isn't leaning into low yield weapons is not correct, but everything else is clearly verifiable with even a basic Google search."
todayilearned,fehz72w,t1_fegu9xq,1579126845.0,"You may be right, but as far as I know, the no paid donor thing is for the same reason you can't be paid for an organ donation, because it creates a market and incentives that result in the exploitation of poor people who need the money, by wealthy people who need the organs. Or in this case, blood."
AskReddit,fehsnoi,t1_feh88os,1579123082.0,"Denuclearization is not really happening as nicely as you're describing here. Major nuclear powers other than the US (China and Russia) are actively redesigning their arsenals with new technology that's moving away from from high yield weapons like ICBMs to lower yield precision tactical weapons like hypersonic cruise missiles.

This might sound like a good thing, but it makes nuclear war more possible, because a state can consider using a nuke on something like a hardened military target, without having to accept the significant civilian casualties and indiscriminate destruction that the old school bombs would almost inevitably cause. Leaders might be more inclined to use the nuclear option if they thought it wasn't going to result in the deaths of millions of innocent people. 

Which is great, but does nothing to mitigate the risk of escalation, environmental damage caused by the explosions and radiation, or do anything for the civilians that will still die in the explosions, and for years to come from radiation sickness and cancer."
AskReddit,feg1d0g,t1_fefmopd,1579072737.0,"I was at a space mining conference full of phds and reps from huge equipment manufacturers and military contractors, not only is it possible, it's happening."
news,fdlyxzh,t1_fdljhjv,1578535832.0,"Gimlet is a big network though. I don't see people abandoning the medium entirely, and Gimlet has the kind of scale you need to negotiate a better rate with advertisers. It's gonna be the little guys who don't have the listener base to get anything better than those CPA deals."
Showerthoughts,fdcfgm9,t1_fdc0pmp,1578273595.0,"That's his greatest power. It's super convenient that planes don't just implode under their own weight when he grabs them, or that nobody gets hurt when he levels a city fighting some bad guy."

interestingasfuck,fd6gn2v,t1_fd6ccfk,1578190708.0,"You would probably end up with a lot shattered brooms, damaged attachments, and injured people."
AskReddit,fcyvpgx,t1_fcxkgsy,1578088109.0,"TIL Pope Francis slaps like an abuela. Also that grip was intense. He seemed legitimately confused and surprised. All in all, I would rather see this than his security detail spear tackling some old crotchety french lady."
todayilearned,fconm1v,t1_fcnr2x9,1577836742.0,"In keeping Christianity out? Probably. 

But let's not pretend like the Samurai class was doing it solely for some high minded reason like the preservation of culture. Japan was operating under a feudal system that was oppressing most of it's people and the introduction of global trade and influence  threatened the delicate economic balance that allowed it to continue."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcceefs,t1_fc9hbr2,1577597441.0,"He didn't really commit a crime though. Was what he did inappropriate and weird. For fucking sure. Did he also do his due diligence and ask for consent? Yes. You could argue those girls felt coerced by his status, but good luck getting any jury to unanimously convict someone on that alone."
Showerthoughts,fbrjjq4,t1_fbphdyu,1577043462.0,"There's also huge stretches of highway in the US in places like the Dakotas where it's basically unpatroled road, because there just around enough people that live there to really justify a police presence. You could easily kill people driving through, and bury the bodies in the hundreds of square miles of wilderness. A friend of mine described it this way. ""You could set a hillside on fire and walk away, and it might take a week for someone to be around to notice.""

Though I can't imagine that's much of a life as a vampire, living in North Dakota, killing hitchhikers and road trippers."
