The idea that ""magic requires an equal payment"" is boring because it tells me the limits and abilities of magic.  It can be interesting if the rules get broken but better yet, don't establish any rules for your magic.

In LOTR, we hardly ever see Gandalf use magic, nor do we have any idea how he uses it.  When he does use it, it tends tbe vague.  Magic systems like those in Eragon or WoT are tiresome and uninspiring."
