depression,fcbvq63,t1_fcag0vo,1577591499.0,my chat thingy is always open if you need. have a good night/day :)
depression,fcaebkg,t1_fcacmky,1577567774.0,"maybe you should look into getting a therapist (if you can, that is!). it really did help me. i was lucky that the first person i contacted, helped me so much right away. 

but, yeah i get it. i have felt that way many times. hell, i still do on bad days. the thing about mental illness is that you can't blame yourself for feeling down because it's not your fault, and you have to undertand that bad days will happen. but also know that you are strong enough to get through them. think of all the little things that make you glad to be alive. even if it's something ""silly"" like a tv show. life is worth it!

i wish you all love and sunshine in the world! xx"
depression,fcabudl,t1_fcaaz2f,1577566370.0,"i'm sorry you're going through such a tough time! do you already go to therapy? are you on medication? i used to feel exactly like that everyday till i got medicated. now, i feel much more balanced and in control (at least, on good days). other things that helped me were guided meditation videos, exercising, reading, spirituality/religion. just things that make you feel good and remind you of happier times i find very helpful."
depression,fc96hfe,t3_egqg5d,1577547798.0,i feel this in my bones!! i just need to constantly remind myself than comparing myself to others doesn't help anyone.
depression,fc9689r,t1_fc92tqq,1577547685.0,i'm sure that not true! being rich means absolutely nothing. what matters is being kind and loving. please don't hurt yourself. it's not worth it. people care! i care! we can chat if you need to! x
depression,fc8zx6c,t1_fc8zeax,1577544795.0,"Exactly! And as someone who is very controlling that is so difficult to do. Just letting go and falling asleep feels like a nightmare. I feel with insomnia, you just have to try all possibilities and find out what work better for you. I'm always here if you need to talk some more! x"
depression,fc8y5cr,t1_fc8ua1m,1577543968.0,"Have you tried exercise during the day to tire yourself out? Also, as I said, reading to get your mind off your problems for a while, listening to some (calm) music, meditating before bed. I truly wish I could help out more! Those are just the things my therapist recommended to me before I started taking the sleeping pills, and I still do those sometimes, especially if I'm really nervous and the meds don't help. Also, try not to worry about sleeping! That was an issue for me. I put too much pressure on myself to sleep and it was counterproductive."
depression,fc8xiwe,t1_fc8orvz,1577543667.0,Thank you! It means a lot to know people care about you! I'm also here for you if you need! Have a great New Year's! x
depression,fc8xd6r,t1_fc8k7g9,1577543593.0,"You're very sweet and kind! I'm very blessed to have found this place, too. Makes me feel as if I'm not so alone in my struggles. I'm here for you! We can talk about anything and help each other when we need! x"
depression,fc8x1se,t1_fc8gss3,1577543445.0,"Please, don't be scared of getting a possible ADHA/ADD diagnosis. Most often than not it's not ""all in your head"" (and that's okay!). Getting to know all that makes you YOU is fine. If it helps you somehow, definately get it checked out! 

Something that helped my intrusive thoughts was exercise (like HIIT and kickboxing, etc.). You get to use all your pent up energy and rage to something constructive and healthy. It feels horrible when you're having a good time and your mood suddenly changes. It feels as if the Universe/God is against you, doesn't it? But you just have to understand yourself and know that it's a part of having a mental illness. Somedays will be tougher than others. Just, please, don't hurt/kill yourself! You never know what the future will bring! Maybe tomorrow a miracle could happen (it sounds lame but it's true!). Just focus on the little things that bring you joy and peace of mind. Go on walks near nature or the beach. Meditate. Play games. Listen to music. Whatever you need. And I'm always here if you need to vent some more!"
depression,fc8vdk1,t1_fc89fh1,1577542620.0,"You don't need an official diagnosis to come talk to me! If you need to talk, I'm here! Hit me up whenever you need. I'm always here for you. I know not having someone you can talk to when you're feeling down and alone is the worst! I feel you! But we can try to help each other! I hope I get to bring a little sunshine your way! :)"
depression,fc8uxzk,t1_fc84ijk,1577542407.0,"Me too! I love reading, movies (mostly horror but I watch anything), astrology, spiritualism, music, and nature. You're welcome to come talk to me, whenever you want/need!! x"
depression,fc8ur6b,t1_fc840ma,1577542309.0,"I'm an INFP and have social anxiety too! Something that has helped me a lot is going to the movies by myself. You only have to buy the ticket (small human interaction!) and then you'll be in a dark room, just enjoying yourself and not having to talk for an hour or two. Also, going to the supermarket by yourself. Try to challenge yourself, little by little. With the depression, it's a little harder! Focus on the things that you love. Music and reading are amazing!! I'm a total bookworm, too, and the feeling of leaving your life behind for a while is heaven. I wish you luck with your recovery! I'm always here if you need! x"
depression,fc8tzxn,t1_fc831nv,1577541937.0,"I don't drink for that exact reason. I know myself enough to know that if I ever touched a drink (or drugs), with my mental illnesses and addictive personality, I'd be doomed. I too have selective mutism. I think I'm on the autism spectrum. Try to challenge yourself a little at a time, and one day you'll be that girl you wish to be. One step at a time! You'll get there! (Also, I wish I could help you with your drinking problem but I don't have any experience with it. Maybe try to find a healthier coping mechanism instead of drinking. Something that you love as much as drinking but know that it won't hurt you as much in the long run. Do not be afraid to get professional help if you need it!)"
depression,fc8t15j,t1_fc7xc8n,1577541451.0,"I hope you get to sleep soon. I'm on sleeping pills because of my insomnia, and I absolutely feel your pain. I sincerely hope that your life gets better from now on. Sending lots of love and blessings your way! (For your sleeping problems: have you tried sleeping teas (or medication) and reading before going to bed so you tire your eyes out? One of the things that helped me is having a nighttime routine. It's not much but it could help! Stay strong!"
depression,fc7mg1z,t1_fc7m7p7,1577512260.0,"it makes total sense! that's why i joined this place! i'm going to sleep, now. but yes, i would be really happy to talk to you again. and you know: if you need to talk, my message box is always open! good night! hope you get to sleep soon (insomnia sucks!!)."
depression,fc7m83a,t3_egmumw,1577512037.0,"your story is very similar to mine (although my grandpa passed away last year). but it's as if you have read my mind! as the time passes, your happy childhood memories seems so far away. when i said that to my therapist, she said i should enjoy the time i have left with my grandma and give her all the love and attention i can, and don't focus as much on the past. i know it doesn't really help a lot when you're depressed but please know that there are always things to live for, and that even if it doesn't seem like it right now, the future holds so many blessings and opportunities. stay strong, friend!"
depression,fc7lqai,t1_fc7lb5g,1577511543.0,"lol i guess so. but i'm usually one to just lay in bed and have a good, long cry and text my therapist if things get really bad. :)"
depression,fc7lhgi,t3_egmpid,1577511301.0,any reason to stay alive is a good reason! i'm proud of you! (also dogs are the best!!)
depression,fbuqks6,t3_eekp1r,1577118782.0,"FIrstly, you do not have to feel bad for seeing a therapist and getting help! After years of dealing with anxiety and depression, I finally had a mental breakdown last year that made me realize I absolutely needed therapy. All my life I'd been scared of getting professional help because I thought ""I'm not crazy. Therapy is for people who are a lot worse than me."" But after my grandpa died unexpectadly, I had no choice. I was miserable and therapy seemed like the only thing that would get me through. I'm very fortunate that I have a wonderful therapist. She put me on antidepressants after a few sessions. I was reluctant at first because I knew side effects would suck. But... it was the best thing I did. Because now, even though I have bad days, I'm much more in control of my emotions and I don't feel as unbalanced. 

You are still young. Life still has so much in store for you. Please, do not kill yourself. You aren't alone, even if sometimes it may look like it. There's always someone out there that  cares and wants to help. If you ever need to talk, I'm here! Stay strong!! x"
