cats,fdjt9kg,t3_elgwbv,1578486705.0,I feed my kitty [Encore](https://encorepetfood.co.uk/cat/wet-food/pouches/). It's a limited ingredient cat food....I don't like how many brands don't accurately describe what's inside their products and bulk them up with grains and cereals :/
cats,fdjln6s,t3_elldfc,1578476805.0,She loves you so much!
cats,fdgfpif,t3_eksg1x,1578394694.0,He is so beautiful! British Shorthairs have to be my favourite breed.
cats,fdgf8tj,t3_einkfu,1578394055.0,Similar to Acana is [Encore pet food](https://encorepetfood.co.uk/cat/) which doesn't contain any grains or cereals and is made up of a protein + a carb. Think they go by the name of Reveal in the US. I've found that using a limited ingredient cat food has helped my baby's stomach.
