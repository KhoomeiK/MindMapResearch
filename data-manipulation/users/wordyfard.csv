woahdude,ffpxmjt,t1_ffp9ukm,1580109858.0,"In fairness, ALF ended 30 years ago. Obviously it's been in syndication and found on the occasional streaming service, and there've been small cameos for ALF here and there, but it should be expected that some people, especially younger folks, will simply have no idea what an ""ALF"" is."
TheGoodPlace,ffpttz1,t3_euctvr,1580105474.0,"Yeah, having a purpose definitely makes a difference.  I mean, humans don't necessarily need ""jobs"" unless they really want one, but they do need hobbies.  Something different and challenging is all it would take.

We all get a little bored from time to time.  You can't just keep doing the same thing for too long or else it gets to be a dreadful chore.  I expect everyone here knows what I'm talking about.  But the thing is, we know how to mix it up.  We stop doing that boring thing, and then we do something else.  And it might take a while, but eventually the boring thing we stopped doing becomes fun/interesting/challenging again.  Two days ago I watched a movie I haven't seen in about 30 years.  I remembered bits and pieces of it, sure, but I was genuinely surprised by how much I didn't remember, and really enjoyed it, much more than I thought I would.

That's why Hypatia's blunt stupidity was so unsettling and unsupportive of the ""happiness zombie"" theory.  Her inability to identify whether the number 5 on her football jersey was ""an S or a math"" means that her purpose at this point in her eternal existence should be to learn math (and perhaps the alphabet) over again.  She doesn't lack agency over her own existence; becoming a happiness zombie is not inevitable.  She chose to let herself deteriorate to that point and she didn't do anything about it.

Should there really be an eternal afterlife where I get to do whatever I want all the time, I believe the actual problem of infinity will be that it actually will never be enough.  In this lifetime alone, I have way more experiences available to try than I'll ever have time for.  I have a video game backlog that I project to be 1,530 hours long, and that's assuming I don't bother to finish most of them.  And if infinity comes along but future human history is chugging right along beside it, then trying to keep up with everything new that's being made while still occasionally re-experiencing the old classics I already love will be an unwinnable task, for infinity.

In the context of the show, this might be a problem with Jeremy Bearimy, because maybe they have to wait 500,000 years for 1 Earth year to pass, who knows, nobody knows.  The show took the cheap way out instead of actually defining how it works.  But that's the show's problem to deal with, and it says nothing about ethics or morals, let alone anything useful about them, because if there is an eternal reward waiting for us after we die, there's no way to know how time there will relate to Earth time, and the show's rules certainly don't dictate that.

But even assuming there's an afterlife ""handicap"" in which it takes a very long time for new things from Earth to arrive, so what?  At some point maybe the Earth melts into a puddle and humanity is done, but does that mean there will never be new video games and new movies, etc.?  I don't believe that.  People already make that stuff just for fun, and if they're all in the same afterlife as me they still will.  Plus I would definitely use some of my eternity to finally learn how to make my own video games, since there would no longer be pressure on me to focus on going to work and other life maintenance stuff.  And I bet so would a lot of other people.  It would actually be self-sustaining, we would no longer be dependent on Earth to bring new content to us at all.  We would inevitably just manufacture it ourselves.

Suppose your true love decides not to opt out of existence, but simply decides the relationship is over.  Maybe you try to talk them out of it but they can't be persuaded otherwise.  If you still love them then the breakup is going to suck for you, but you can't force them to stay in that relationship if they no longer want to be there.  And so, despite what you want most, the relationship is over.  And I see no difference between a relationship that ends because one person opted out of the relationship and one that ends because one person opted out of all of existence."

milwaukee,fffw8s5,t1_fffq0ug,1579893170.0,"Well, I disagree with that completely.  To say that because ""random"" (self-selecting) people from around the world so overwhelmingly prefer the aesthetics of the People's Flag compared to other flags, it therefore overrides the preferences of symbolism expressed by the actual citizens of Milwaukee who the flag will ultimately represent, is totally bonkers.  If the symbolism no longer matters because the shapes and colors are liked by people with no connection to the place the flag purportedly represents, then it would be an equally acceptable flag for Liechtenstein, despite it being a landlocked country.

And the point of contention is not People's Flag versus current Milwaukee flag.  Most naysayers agree that the current flag should go, they just think that the People's Flag isn't what should replace it.  The idea that it absolutely must be one or the other is a false dichotomy routinely raised by supporters of the People's Flag, and no one on the anti side is ever going to have their minds changed by it.

This problem would be best solved by openly and publicly inviting people who are against the adoption of the People's Flag to submit their proposals for what the flag should be, and then putting those designs to a vote (amongst Milwaukee citizens, and perhaps surrounding areas, but not the entire world.)"
milwaukee,fffo45r,t1_ffemjr1,1579888132.0,"Overall, I don't much care one way or another, but what exactly does a generic poll open to the entire world prove?  The naysayers generally feel that the ""People's Flag"" doesn't accurately represent Milwaukee or its people.  Your site just has people clicking on whichever colors or shapes are most pleasing to them, without ascribing any value to them.

They don't even know it's a flag meant for Milwaukee when they vote, unless previously exposed to it elsewhere.  As far as voters on your site are concerned, it could be the flag for Detroit, San Antonio, Port Au Prince, Pakistan, or even Froopyland and it would make no difference.

If all you're looking for in a flag is popular shapes and colors, then I suppose the People's Flag is indeed a very good fit.  But if you care about the deeper meaning behind the symbolism and don't think the meaning ascribed to the People's Flag is truly representative of Milwaukee, you just might be against it."
TheGoodPlace,ffe856b,t1_ffe64nc,1579839300.0,"But that strikes at the heart of what's wrong with the message this episode sends.  If Jason is bored by monkeys in go-karts because it's not challenging enough, the problem isn't that The Good Place offers no challenges, it's that Jason lacks the capacity to imagine a worthwhile challenge for himself.  In which case the solution is not for him to end his own existence, but to find activities that will challenge him.

And if this is a systemic problem that affects even those with intellects and imaginations many times greater than Jason's, then the answer lies in other people.  Here on Earth, we don't just kill ourselves because we can't think of anything to do when left to our own devices.  We participate in experiences crafted by other people, and for better or for worse, those experiences give meaning to we who participate and to the creators who made them."
gaming,ffe6n8j,t1_ffd2lwu,1579838106.0,"Yeah, but then we get back to the whole ""worldwide appeal"" thing.  It's not *just* the number of characters, it's how they represent their franchise and what they bring to Smash that makes each one special, and that includes some analysis into what it means to be a ""unique"" character.  Basically the entire gripe with Fire Emblem characters is that, even though each one may be ""unique"" in the strictest interpretation of the word, as Smash characters they don't feel as distinct from one another as characters from other series, on average.

I would be interested to know what Japanese players think of all the Fire Emblem characters.  I've long since accepted that FE is popular over there, but does it necessarily follow that they're fans of having the FE characters in Smash?  Like, if they had been given the choice between Byleth, another Pokemon, or another equally realizable character, would they have chosen Byleth?

As an example of what I mean, I'm a huge fan of the Mario franchise, so one might assume I'd cheer on the addition of any Mario rep, but in reality I couldn't care less that Daisy made it into Smash Ultimate because she's just a Peach clone.  I would rather have had somebody else, and the only way Daisy in her current form is justifiable in my eyes is that her inclusion obviously took less development time than including a fully unique interpretation of her or some other character altogether, and even that justification is tenuous."
TheGoodPlace,ffe0zgs,t1_ffdzi1s,1579833888.0,"I don't believe that follows with what was established this episode or the series as a whole.  I don't do DVR so I can't replay the episode to verify, but I believe one of the characters (Janet?) said a person who goes through the door will ""be at peace,"" implying death/non-existence.

But even if I'm mistaken about that, this series has taken a very structured view of the afterlife, in which there is/was a rigid points system and three possible destinations for humans who died, flawed as they were, but clearly orchestrated by higher beings.  Because either those things would have to be established and organized by someone, or else everything that exists in those realm and the way things work there would just be by coincidence.  And I don't believe that the team just invented ""The Random Place.""

""We don't know what will happen"" is also a very common way for humans to try and explain what happens after death.  Because we all have ideas, but none of us really know."

""It was all a dream"" would have been an immensely better way to end the series.  It's that bad.

I have a lot more I can say on this, and will do so eventually (especially if next week's episode doesn't make good on torpedoing the ideas explored in this episode) but for right now, this is just a gut reaction.  The idea that one could get so bored of infinite happiness that the only/best solution is irreversibly ending your existence is complete bullshit.  Fuck the fucking filter.

TheGoodPlace,fdxzmbj,t3_en6kgs,1578774545.0,"I don't think it's all that weird.  Remember that the key to Mindy's afterlife is that if they awarded her the points that the system said the act of withdrawing all your money from the bank to start a global charity that would help society in every possible way was worth, she would have had enough points to get into TGP naturally.  It wouldn't have required any reanalysis of the scoring system.  And she'd have been the first new resident in nearly 500 years.  That's a big deal.

Contrast that with what Michael was asking of the committee, to completely revise the criteria by which people are judged and fundamentally alter the structure of the afterlife, potentially allowing millions if not billions of humans previously judged as bad to be admitted to The Good Place.  That requires more thought.  It's easy to just roll over and give your opponent whatever they want if you don't have to do anything.  They're like the judge in that way.  If you do all the work and fix the problem for them, they'll happily agree to your proposal.  But if you come to them with a problem and expect them to do the work to fix the problem, they're going to analyze it first.

Even Michael needed hundreds of years to develop the understanding that humans weren't really as bad as he'd understood them to be, and that was with direct observation of four humans in particular.  Imagine The Good Place committee just agreeing to fight for and potentially take in all those souls that to their understanding were sent to The Bad Place for a reason, via a points system that was supposed to be incapable of error.  They wouldn't know what they'd be getting.  If they wanted to be right they'd have to do all the research they probably did for Mindy times a few million or billion.

Rentals actually wouldn't change at all with this hypothetical new approach, so what you're suggesting is that it would cut into the profit made from buys.  Which could happen in two ways. (1) For everyone currently renting then buying, they would be getting a discount over the existing model.  (2) For everyone currently buying prematurely to avoid wasting money on rental fees, they would now be able to rent first and avoid buying what they don't like.

But that's looking at the data in only one direction.  I'm someone who barely watches movies and completely skips even ones that look interesting to me simply because even thinking about participating in the current process makes my skin start to crawl.  But if I could rent a movie risk-free (by which I mean absent of the possibility that I'll like the movie and end up having to pay more in total than I would have if I'd just bought it in the first place) it would cause me to rent more movies, and in turn buy more movies as well.  I'm only one person, but how many missed opportunities like me are out there?  And is there room for even avid movie renters and buyers to rent/buy more under a more forgiving model?  Maybe the proceeds from that would replace and even surpass what gets lost from would-be buyers turned renters.

I consider this similar to how the PC gaming market was reinvented by Valve when they launched Steam.  Steam, of course, is not a perfect comparison because it doesn't rent out its products, but it did make the cost of participating in its ecosystem a lot more beneficial on the users' side, which is what this hypothetical approach in the movie industry would really be all about.  And if there was anyone at the time predicting that Valve's approach was costing them money versus employing more traditional sales tactics, those critics have long since been silenced.  It could work in a very similar way for movies, we just don't know because no one has ever tried it."

That conflicts with the earlier part of your post.  If Blockbuster was paying more than MSRP for those movies then they couldn't have possibly sold them at MSRP to a customer, never mind less the rental fee, otherwise they would be out money unless the movie had been rented out enough times prior to the sale, and obviously no one would pay MSRP for a heavily used videotape if they could get it brand new for the same price.

Whatever arrangement the digital distributors have with the studios these days, it can't be identical to the one Blockbuster had because there is no physical product.  Nothing changes hands when a sale is made, the distributor just says ""okay, you can stream this now.""  If there are any insane fee structures associated with that model that make what I've proposed unviable for the digital distributors, circle right back around to my original argument: it is the studios' fault for making it so."
Showerthoughts,fdhjgui,t3_elede8,1578423948.0,"It felt fair because the nature of physical media required renting and buying to be separate processes.  And Blockbuster needed to make money to provide their service, a service which people wanted.

It feels unfair online because the nature of digital media no longer requires renting and buying to be separate processes, and yet they've been propped up as such by media companies.

Suppose you rent a digital movie; you now have the right to stream it as much as you want for the duration of a purely arbitrary period of time decided by the licensor.  Unlike Blockbuster, you're not returning the physical copy so that somebody else may rent it, it goes away just because you didn't pay what they felt was fair for perpetual streaming rights.  At least that part of it makes some sense; you paid a portion of the purchase price so you get a portion of the benefits.

But suppose you liked that movie so much that you decide you want perpetual streaming rights.  So you buy a copy.  Well, that's great, now you can watch it over and over again with no limits.  But if you'd known that from the start, you wouldn't have needed to rent it all, and could have saved yourself 4 bucks.

So you start to think, ""hey, maybe I'll just buy movies right away from the beginning, that will save me money.""  But every now and then you buy a piece of crap that you end up hating, and suddenly renting them first makes sense again.  Ultimately you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.  The paradox of being unable to win no matter whether renting or buying is your default option makes the process of acquiring movies digitally feel bad.

The movie companies could fix this if they wanted to.  Instead of making it so there's no way to win, they could make it so that there's no way to lose by making renting a step along the way to buying.  Go ahead and rent that movie; if you want to buy it later, the price of the rental would simply be deducted from your purchase price.  Did you need to rent it twice before finally deciding to buy?  Okay then, that's (purchase price - (rental price * 2)).  Have you rented it so many times that you've now exceeded the purchase price?  Then you can buy it for free.

The movie companies think they would make less money from this arrangement, but I think they're wrong.  There are so many movies that I'm interested in that go unwatched because both renting and buying feel unfair.  If I rent it and like it, I screwed myself.  If I buy it and hate it, I screwed myself.  The only way to get it right consistently is to know which movies I like before I've even seen them, which is impossible.  So instead of renting or buying, I usually do neither, and the movie company makes nothing."

>There’s a higher cost of entry for Apple TV+. 

It's not a weird cultural thing at all.  When you demand a premium price for your content/product/whatever, you have to be able to convince people it's worth the premium.  A lot of us aren't convinced.

Apple TV+ is also shrouded in mystery to the average consumer and lacks ease of access.  You can watch it from a web browser in a pinch, but how many people are able (and willing) to do that on their TV?  Even if you have a smart TV with a web browser, it's an unconventional and inconvenient approach.

Outside of that, you have to be in the Apple ecosystem, and while the iPhone is popular, who really wants to watch TV on their phone instead of on their TV?  Not that no one does it, but it's hardly the default.  For the best experience, on your big screen TV with minimal annoyance in getting to the content, Apple expects you to buy an Apple TV.  Which again comes at a premium price compared to buying a Roku or using the apps built in to your smart TV, but what about Apple TV makes it worth the money Apple wants for one besides the fact that they've partially gated their content behind it?"

For the most part, the current UI does its job by showing my most recently used content.  That's what I'm there to play most of the time, after all.  But it's when I don't know what I'm in the mood for that things could seriously be improved.  Going into the library alone is a bit of a hassle because there's no hotkey for it; I'm forced to scroll all the way to the right, then select it, and then be presented with a view that I may not want and have to change anyway.

Right from the home menu, I should be able to use smart filtering and sorting options that I can toggle on and off to create different views.  The default sorting option would be ""most recently accessed"" with no other filters enabled.  But others would be to sort by ""least recently accessed"", ""alphabetical"", ""most playtime"", ""least playtime"", ""most recently purchased"" and ""least recently purchased.""

Then it should be possible to filter games by factors like ""digital"", ""game card required"", ""currently installed"", ""online multiplayer"", ""split-screen multiplayer"", ""games in the Mario franchise"", ""games in the Zelda franchise"", ""games developed by Nintendo"", ""games NOT developed by Nintendo"", etc.

I should note that some version of some of these options already exist on the All Software screen, but they are purely exclusive of each other when some of them could be inclusive of each other, and the All Software screen is in an out of the way location, and I think that distinction is unnecessary and harmful to the overall presentation.

I currently have 41 icons on my Switch, 29 of which of don't show up on the home screen, and out of the remaining 12, only the first 4–5 are easily accessible.  This problem will only get worse over time as I accumulate more and more software for my Switch.  Quite frankly, I like the All Software > By Time Last Played view much more than the home screen because it shows me my last 12–18 titles.  I don't need icons that are that huge.  Certainly they may be beneficial for those with poor eyesight, but icon scaling should be another user-customizable preference, sort of like it is in the NES/SNES online interface, but prettier like the Switch home screen UI.

On top of all this, there ought to be a search function, so that if I know I just want to play Smash Bros., I don't have to think about where it is in the UI relative to everything else I've ever played, I can just type in ""SMA"" and have the UI bring it up."

In your first example, Age of Empires 2, the single-player campaign is totally irrelevant unless you *want* to play it.  You're within your rights to enjoy as much or as little of the game as you want, and it sounds like you've gotten plenty of value out of the multiplayer mode anyways.  As for the multiplayer mode, that's also not a reason to backlog it.  You should consider yourself free to enjoy replaying whatever you have when the moment is right, and you don't have to backlog a game to do so.

In your second example, this is a problem I've brushed up against a bunch of times.  My response is that there are simply too many games these days to care about the ones that are too far out of sync with what I actually desire to play.  Most often I hear that ""you just need to give *x* game more time until it gets good"" and I say ""no I don't, it should have been good right from the start, and I'm going to prioritize my time playing games that actually succeed at this.""  I'll happily de-backlog a game after a half hour if the first half hour sucks.  I'll abandon a game dead in the middle if I realize I've been grinding uncreative level after uncreative level designed to pad the campaign length rather than actually offer new and interesting content.

But all of that really depends on how much you know about games and how much you know about yourself as a gamer.  Have you ever played a game beyond the initial point of disinterest, and had that change your opinion of the game?  Or has your gut reaction always been right?  If it's the former, it's to your benefit to identify what specific signs you overlooked that would have allowed you to judge the game and other games like it more accurately, so as not to make similar mistakes in the future and to put your mind at ease when you de-backlog a game."

But then I think about how incredibly short lived the euphoria will be.  They'll be just like all the other drivers I already have, useful only in very select situations.  You only play as the characters the game lets you play as unless you willingly accept a handicap to play as your favorites.  Meanwhile, there will be tons of additional grinding ahead to max out my new characters so that they're actually useful, and the grinding in this game is awful, because again you have to race the same tracks over and over that your characters are good at, again unless you want to be handicapped.  And in the end it's all for nothing, because whether you win or lose is barely reflective of your talent, it's mostly reflective of how much money you spent relative to the people you've been pitted against.

Then Cleveland's show got cancelled and he came back, and FG maintained things for a couple more seasons, then finally started to slump.

Metal Mario is in my shop today. I don't have him yet. He costs 12,000 coins and I only have 11,685 with my daily coin earning capability depleted. I've completed both tour challenges. I have three gifts left to open but even if I could get that many stars, which is unlikely, I'd still be 15 coins short. The only realistic path to 12,000 coins today is to trade 5 rubies for a coin rush.

I have 397 rubies. My goal is to save up to 450 to use when a spotlight item I give a damn about shows up. If next tour features Mustache Toad and Bathrobe Mario as expected, I probably wouldn't use the pipe even if I reach 450. I saw a rumor that the pipe may contain some past spotlight drivers as well but even that is unlikely to change my feelings towards it.

And even if it did I think reaching 450 rubies next tour is unlikely; by my count the most I can get next tour is 40 rubies (26 from gift boxes, 10 from daily login and 4 from a challenge that's within reach.) I just made it to level 40 so I don't think the next ruby award is in reach next tour. All in all I expect this will leave me 13 rubies short if I don't spend 5 rubies today, or 18 short if I do.

So buying Metal Mario today would deprive me of 5 fairly insignificant rubies (although I could regret not having them later) and my entire coin balance (which is more likely to sting later.) But it also might be the best way to use these items. I already have the gold glider (level 1, so upgrading it is a possibility) and the Starchute (level 2.)

I could, of course, have it all simply by forking over $5 for the gold pass (I already used the free trial) but I would rather not support the game monetarily. So it's a matter of determining how best to allocate the resources I have."

Amico,fcjh3r8,t1_fcbc2l3,1577687368.0,"Compete is probably the wrong word. I don't think many people will be choosing between an Amico and a PS5 or XSX. When I decide whether or not to buy a new gaming console, I primarily look for differentiation from the other consoles I already own or plan to buy. 

Ever since they've been competing, I've never bought ""the new PlayStation"" and ""the new Xbox"" at the same time, they've always been at least a year apart and often more, to allow the runner-up enough time to build up a unique library of its own. I simply am not going to need two consoles capable of playing GTA 6. The runner-up will need to forge its own identity.

But Amico isn't part of that fight. As long as the final build is on par with what's been teased so far, that will make it easy for me to justify buying an Amico at launch to go alongside whatever my initial next-gen console choice ends up being, be it PS5 or XSX.

And there's also the casual market to think about, the ones that bought the Wii in massive numbers and the ones that made smartphone gaming a phenomenon. I'm not at all sure how that will go; the barrier to entry is high and the odds of sustainability are low.  But however many they convince to give Amico a try, chances are those people were unlikely to buy a PS5 or XSX anyway. Plenty of people prefer simplicity."

The area I live in is currently mourning the loss of a member of the community who was run down by an inattentive driver. The victim was on the sidewalk, walking her dogs. Unfortunately for her, the distracted driver was also on the sidewalk. One of her dogs died too.

The driver fled the scene. For now, he or she has escaped responsibility for their actions. The only thing that could have prevented this tragedy was if the driver had learned how important their responsibility behind the wheel was before they killed a person.

In your story, OP, the driver demonstrated three irresponsible behaviors (drugs behind the wheel, alcohol behind the wheel and admission to distracted driving) and you enabled a fourth by helping him escape culpability for his actions.

Ultimately it's on the driver to learn the right lesson here, I can't fairly say that he hasn't, but the mindset he exhibited in the wake of the incident is the same as a hit-and-run driver. ""Oh shit, I'm gonna get I'm trouble for this, how do I protect myself"" instead of ""Oh my gosh, what have I done?""

You may have ""saved his future"" but you may also have inadvertently signed the future death warrant of some innocent person if the punishment he receives isn't enough to convince him to change his ways. Next time there might be a person between his car and the tree."
