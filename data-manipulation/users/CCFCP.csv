CrazyHand,fffxzpy,t1_fffx3hp,1579894259.0,"Yes I read your post which is why I commented on it, I recognize you’re struggling m8.

The advice you’ve been given is good enough, stop playing so aggressively and think your strategy through. If you’re in elite but can’t crack 2mil with another character then your Greninja play style has definitely carried you, you can’t adapt, and/or you need to learn about matchups."
CrazyHand,fffwmuy,t1_fffw7rq,1579893415.0,"I don’t know anyone that types out 2mil at 2000.000 lol. Pikachu isn’t the easiest character to play but if you’re 6.15mil+ on any character you should be able to crack 2mil with any other character especially considering Pikachu has been in the game since N64 days.

Thanks 4 the downvote though."
CrazyHand,fffw2vr,t3_etaehb,1579893067.0,It's kind of hard to believe you're in Elite Smash but you can't crack 200k with another character unless you're experiencing some ungodly lag down there.

signupsforpay,ffcxi71,t1_ffbtoxo,1579809323.0,"Hey Claude, like I told you in our messages my last signup to get my 10 was on the 17th according to TradeUp (and I have screenshots to prove it), you supposedly signed up on the 15th according to what you told me. That’s why you were still included. I never got any credit for the last 4 digits of your number. I followed up with many people who $bid on this post asking them if they had actually used my link and that I had a max of 10 - most did not follow through or even reply to me.

As you can see from looking through the comments, I haven’t accepted any offers past the 11th. You were not paid for your sign up because you preemptively told me you signed up when you weren’t even 2 days later. As far as closing the post, I can do that now."

Look at how dominant Burroughs was back then and you’ll understand why a 7-4 is significant considering IIRC Askren lost 11-0 to him. Burroughs would destroy Khabib if it was pure wrestling."

MMA,ffa64d8,t1_ff9wrkr,1579728621.0,"How many of those top 70 or top 300 wrestlers that year went into MMA let alone the UFC and have a punch like Gaethje’s? How many have the takedown defense like Gaethje? I’m sure no one believes Gaethje will stuff every single takedown and use Khabib’s own tactics against him, but in most people’s minds this will be the toughest wrestling of Khabib’s career."

Just watched the matches, I have very little experience with Sonic so I can’t really help because the spin/fair definitely works on me causing me to be more distant with WFT and using my projectiles more BUT
