Wait it out for a little bit longer, and if it continues for an uncomfortable amount of time, try to seek out help. Best of luck to you!"
Anxiety,ffk29x1,t3_etzquf,1580013594.0,"I’ve had severe GAD for about 15 years and have never had an entire day where I felt absolutely NO anxiety. I have good days where the anxiety is minimal, and bad days where it follows me all day. 

After years of practice, I’ve learned to accept that I will always have anxious thoughts. I used to constantly fight them... thinking that I HAD to get rid of them. In reality, that mindset made my anxiety worse. Because when the anxious thoughts didn’t go away, I would end up feeling like a failure and the cycle continued.

Meditation, mindfulness, and therapy has helped me more than any of my medication ever has. It has taught me to live in the present moment and to use coping mechanisms to change the way I’m thinking about my anxiety. For example, when a thought pops into my head like “You’re going to have a panic attack at work today”, I stop and say “Anxiety” and categorize it into “Speculation”. When you treat your thoughts like clouds in the sky (as cliche as that sounds) it helps to recognize that your thoughts are just thoughts and they pass. Most importantly, THOUGHTS DO NOT EQUAL FACTS! It has taken so much practice, but I get better at it every day. 

The goal with GAD is to make it more manageable. Medication can definitely help bring you to a more comfortable state, but my anxiety is so severe that it never works as a cure all for me. From my experience, you have to put in the work of retraining the way you think about your anxious thoughts. I will be rooting for you and sending you all the positive vibes!"
Anxiety,ffh9bwn,t3_etlsz9,1579926864.0,"I feel you on this one. Social media makes us feel like we “need” to check it because “everyone else” does. I found that Facebook made me feel depressed every time I went on it, so I deactivated my account. I created a new Instagram where I’m only following my close friends, and am only letting close friends follow me. 

Don’t be afraid to deactivate your accounts and do what’s best for you! Who you are isn’t defined by social media."

Anxiety,ffeb942,t3_et4sfo,1579841941.0,"I totally get this! I’ve always been super worried about the people I love and think the worse when I can’t get ahold of them. Sometimes I will drive 40 minutes to my boyfriend’s house to make sure his car is there, and then drive back home. Every time this has happened, it turns out he just fell asleep and didn’t hear his phone going off. 

I try to tell myself that worrying can’t do anything to help the situation. It is what it is, and regardless of what is going on, I can’t change it. No amount of worrying or thinking of possible scenarios will do anything. So, I do things to distract myself - watching my favorite comedy show, drawing, reading, exercising, etc. Something to get my mind off of it. And I’ve also asked my boyfriend to text me when he goes to sleep so I know that he is okay if I don’t hear from him. He doesn’t always do this, but it’s helpful when he does! Maybe you can ask your boyfriend to do the same. Sending all good vibes your way!"
leaves,ffcacsl,t3_esul6f,1579795139.0,"I was an everyday, all day smoker for 3 years and I’m currently 44 days sober. I still have THC in my system. I’ve been exercising daily and drinking lots of water to push it out faster, but I’m slightly overweight so it’s going to take longer for me than it may take for others.

The most frustrating thing about it is that even though it feels like I haven’t smoked in forever, I still have this damn drug in me. The only thing to do is to keep pushing forward and not give up!"
generalizedanxiety,feznas2,t3_eqw13z,1579459279.0,"I am on a very low dose of Klonopin, and it has done wonders for me. My anxiety/panic is absolutely horrible in the morning, and I often find myself physically sick to my stomach before going to work. Klonopin allows me to calm down to the point where I am able to have some sort of control over my emotions. It does not take away my anxiety completely, as no drug will, but definitely makes it more manageable. 

My advice is to make sure you use it only as directed by your doctor as it is easy to become dependent on it. And to talk to your doctor immediately if you feel like you are becoming too heavily reliant on the drug. Hopefully your other meds will help balance you out so you will not need to take it too often. 

I hope this helps! Good luck on your journey with GAD."

Anxiety,feabdap,t1_fe9jimx,1578946594.0,That’s awesome! Congratulations on making it through  the day. That’s definitely an achievement. List making is such a good idea. It really helps make the day seem less overwhelming and more manageable. You’ve got this!
Anxiety,fe8a74m,t1_fe6s56r,1578924137.0,"I’m so sorry to hear you are going through this! It definitely is not easy, but you are brave and strong for making it to work. 

Whenever I’m in the thick of it, I find it best to find something to distract myself and get out of my head. Things to “ground” me and put me back in the present moment. When I’m in the bathroom feeling sick, I will think of five things I can see/hear/smell etc. I will also read happy news articles on my phone and focus on my breathing. It’s also helpful to break down your day into smaller sections. For example, instead of worrying how you’re going to make it through an entire day of work, tell yourself “I’m going to go in and see how I feel in an hour” And keep doing that until the day is over. 

I wouldn’t say I have completely overcome this. I’m currently unemployed after quitting my last job because of it. I’ve been seeing a therapist every few weeks, but am starting an intensive therapy program later this month. I think therapy will definitely help you! Everyone is different, so your therapist can help figure out what’s best for you. 

Best of luck to you on your journey. Please know that you are not alone in this, and celebrate every success you have, no matter how small."
leaves,fe6moe7,t3_enzw3h,1578896164.0,"Congratulations on making the decision to quit! That’s a huge step and I know how difficult that is. 

I also used weed as an emotional crutch. I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, and I was 100% convinced that weed was the only thing that could help me feel better. In reality, it made my anxiety a whole lot worse, and I had to smoke more and more to find any relief to the point where I couldn’t go an hour without smoking. 

When I first quit, I did feel like I lost my best friend. There was nothing to turn to anymore to have that instant relief from my emotions. After my initial withdrawal symptoms went away, I found that exercise, specifically running, brought me that same “high” that weed did - but better! I have made it a goal to run a 5K in the fall, which is really big for me because I couldn’t fathom doing anything remotely close to that when I was smoking daily. Meditation and journaling have also been really helpful for me when I feel overwhelmed. 

Really, the best advice I have is to take it one day at a time, and to find a new activity, or maybe an old passion, that gives you a healthy “high”. Withdrawal symptoms are different for everyone and it might really suck for a little bit. But just believe in yourself and keep going! You’ve got this!"
Anxiety,fe67m41,t1_fe66fqu,1578883587.0,"Yes! I totally agree. Anxiety is different for everyone, and severe anxiety can be so debilitating. I’ve learned to accept that people will not always understand, but I try to educate them as best I can. I am sorry we both have to go through this, but am glad we can relate to one another!"
Anxiety,fe655vr,t3_env53v,1578882015.0,"I also have GAD and depression and would often get sick to my stomach in the morning before leaving for work at two of my previous jobs. If I didn’t actually vomit, then I felt intensely like I was going to. These jobs sucked the life out of me and were awful, so I was having anxiety attack after anxiety attack every single morning before I left for work. 

People don’t know how to react when you tell them that... and they often try to change the subject. It’s unfortunate, but it’s hard for them to understand because they have never experienced it. Anxiety symptoms are different for everyone, but you’re definitely not alone. Reading this also made me feel less alone with my stomach issues related to anxiety."
leaves,fdgpe21,t3_el832h,1578404777.0,"Thank you so much for sharing your story. You are incredibly brave and strong, and I am so glad you are still here with us. You’ve helped me feel less alone with this post, and I’m sure many others! 

I’ve always had depression, but during weeks two and three of sobriety, it was worse than it has ever been. I was harming myself and had intense suicidal idealizations. It was absolutely terrifying. My boyfriend was my savior in these instances, but he was ready to take me to the hospital a couple of the times when it was really bad. 

I’m on Day 28 and still have some bouts of depression, but it’s not as constant as it was even a week ago. This week has been a lot better! The crazy thing to me about my withdrawal is the multitude of symptoms and how they seem to come one day, stay INTENSELY for a little bit, then leave. The severity of my depression was enough to make me never want to go through it again, and therefore never consume cannabis again. 

Note: I’ve been in consistent therapy for about four years, but mostly talk about my anxiety disorders. The depression I felt has caused me to seek out more intensive therapy that can help me with those overwhelming emotions if/when I feel them again. Best of luck to everyone out there! It does get better."
leaves,fd6fad5,t1_fd66dh1,1578190101.0,Damn. It’s just so crazy to me how long this lasts. Congratulations on five months!
leaves,fd2ldut,t1_fd2gu4l,1578148871.0,"Ugh, I’m sorry to hear that! It’s crazy to me just how long withdrawal symptoms last. It’s definitely one way to prevent me from becoming a daily smoker again though. Keep me updated on how it goes for you!"
Anxiety,fcup1gs,t3_ej072j,1577985640.0,"Yep! I’m the same way. It sometimes takes me days to prepare to make a phone call even to my psychiatrist’s office! I’ve found that just doing it over and over again is the only way to get over the fear. 

When I’m feeling over the top anxious about it, I ask myself, what is the worst that could happen? Maybe I fumble over my words or there’s an awkward silence. But, in less than five minutes, the conversation is over and we’ll both move on with our day. The phone call won’t hurt you, it won’t kill you, and it will only make you stronger for the next time you have to do it! 

Another tip is to write down a “script” of what you’re going to say. This helps me so much, especially when calling a brand new place or ordering food. 

You got this!"
Anxiety,fcpdj0m,t3_eies8o,1577859408.0,I needed this. Thank you. Happy New Year!
Anxiety,fcn5lfh,t3_ei0gsi,1577803876.0,"I’ve had anxiety ever since I can remember. So, I guess 3-4 years old? At first, I was severely attached to my mom and would cry uncontrollably whenever she left the house because I was convinced she would die in a car accident. It then turned into a fear of germs/OCD when I was 9-10. For years after that, I would get physically sick to my stomach any time I spent the night outside of my house (hotels, camping, cousin’s house, etc). 

My parents never understood why I acted the way I did, so I didn’t receive any help until I was diagnosed by my primary care physician with anxiety when I was 17. At 23, I finally saw a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, and major depression. It was like a punch in the gut to get those diagnoses. 

I often get upset that my parents didn’t get me help sooner. I feel like a lot of my anxiety could have been worked through with therapy at a young age. I’m now 27 and can’t hold down a job because my anxiety is so severe. 

I am so grateful for communities like this and for other avenues that are breaking the stigma of mental illness and anxiety. I am very open about my anxiety in the hopes to help others get the help they need as soon as possible."
leaves,fbe3b3u,t1_fbe256a,1576777256.0,"My anxiety got a lot worse initially after stopping because it was the way I would cope whenever I felt the slightest hint of worry or panic. Then after a few days, it came in waves. And now, Day 9, I feel a lot less anxious in general and more “balanced”. 

I have generalized anxiety disorder, so I’m pretty much anxious all the time. And that is why I started smoking in the first place so I could quiet my mind! About a year into smoking everyday, I developed debilitating, severe anxiety and was then diagnosed with social anxiety, panic disorder, and agoraphobia. I was convinced weed was helping me, but as I look back on it, I believe it made all of my issues 100x worse."
