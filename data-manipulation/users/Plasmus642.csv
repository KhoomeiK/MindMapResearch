Thankfully it's infrequent for me, but it's happened a couple times and the mirror thing in particular is a very disturbing sensation especially if you're not expecting it. There's just something inexplicably *incorrect* about it."

Edit: Seems I was wrong, the link in the Youtube description is actually wrong. You need to put https:// before it for it to work. Still don't see a link to buy it on the page, though.

We’re getting more and more polarized and it’s making it harder and harder to actually get anything done. Shut the fuck up, both of you."

And given our incredible rate of technological advancement in the last 200 years, things previously thought impossible, I don't discount anything as impossible anymore. It's less a matter of ""if"" and more a matter of ""when."""
casualiama,fffbrbs,t1_fff7u0v,1579880470.0,"Sexual attraction and romantic attraction are two different things. She is asexual and biromantic, meaning she can be romantically attracted to people of either sex, but isn’t sex-driven. I’m the other way around, I’m bisexual and aromantic, meaning I am sexually attracted to both sexes but I don’t really form romantic relationships with people. I just have no interest in it, the same way she’s not interested in sex.

You can also be bisexual and hetero/homo romantic, meaning you’re sexually attracted to both but only romantically attracted to one. You can also be gay or straight and also be ace/aro, it just takes a little more clarification, because you might be homosexual and aromantic or asexual and homoromantic. I would classify both of those as gay (or straight if you replace homo with hetero), but they’re two distinctly different types of attraction.

Being bi and asexual at the same time isn’t an oxymoron like you seem to think it is."

There are accommodations for statistical outliers all throughout society. Building codes include ramps for the physically disabled, laws protect against discrimination based on minority status, etc. 

I don’t think that being statistical outliers means they shouldn’t have a say."
edmproduction,ffaqyns,t1_ffa5ug9,1579742427.0,"You say that like guitar is *never* music. Sure on stuff like Eruption I tend to agree with you here (Even as a guitar player. Impressive I guess but not all that pleasant to listen to), but listen to something like Explosions in the Sky's guitars and tell me with a straight face it's not music."
HighQualityGifs,ff6iojb,t1_ff62ywa,1579628032.0,"They even varied the animation framerate by character in certain situations to give a subconscious impression of clumsiness. Like when Miles is learning to swing from Peter B. Parker, Peter is animated every single frame while Miles is only animated every other frame. As he learns, his framerate increases, making his movements smoother as he gets the hang of it.

Absolutely genius movie."
