DaystromInstitute,ffet44v,t1_ffeovhz,1579864267.0,Thanks for the clarification!  That would mean that non-abandoned clones whose Temporal RNA was activated would be viable and thus this would be a viable way for Romulans to quickly grow their numbers (at the possible cost of generic diversity?  But then genetic defects can be corrected in that era so maybe it's not important)

Wasn't he dying from some genetic disorder Picard had had fixed as a youth, but that Romulans didn't know about until it was too late (or because they had scrapped the project and didn't care anymore)?"

TCK,ffbjwle,t3_esiu5u,1579768803.0,"Middle-aged TC""K"" here.  Sweden is my adopted home and I've lived here since before you were born.  Ignorance is not something I would accuse Swedes of (I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't know where Andorra is).  But do keep in mind your peers are also only 14 or so, and they have not had the pressure most of us have felt to quickly assimilate knowledge, including languages.  They'll get there.  As far as forgetting, I'm always surprised how much I remember and I think it's because my memories have different ""flavors"", meaning the locations and languages are different and it makes it easy to compartmentalize them.  

Swedes have a hard time making new friends as adults, so make friends now while you still can (and they'll usually last forever)

It stands to reason that wherever we find humanoid life, the Progenitors were there to seed that world.  IIRC in TOS we do find that at least one humanoid species is native to Andromeda, so that means the Progenitors at the very least had a foothold there and so spanned at least two galaxies."
