BeachHouse,ffedzmm,t1_ffedg2d,1579844503.0,"Yes, you're right. I just hope they don't make their sound more perfect or extremely saturated on their next album and keep it simplistic. I'm OK with new sound, but not with extremely perfect and refined sound."
BeachHouse,ffed8uu,t1_fcoanpy,1579843784.0,"I'm not sure if they can still push their sound further or if it would be a good idea. They tried to expand their sound in Teen Dream and Bloom and returned anyway to simpler melodies and arrangements from their first albums in Depression Cherry. The group said in a press release:

>In general, this record \[Depression Cherry\] shows a return to simplicity, with songs  structured around a melody and a few instruments, with live drums  playing a far lesser role. With the growing success of Teen Dream and  Bloom, the larger stages and bigger rooms naturally drove us towards a  louder, more aggressive place; a place farther from our natural  tendencies. Here, we continue to let ourselves evolve while fully  ignoring the commercial context in which we exist.

Also, the more they try to refine and perfect their sound, the more they destroy their own magic. As the group also stated:

>There are all different types of artists and I think that some people  like to hold onto things and they get very perfectionistic. But  perfectionism is kind of a synonym for destruction. It can really be a  deterrent for one's evolution."
