Okay... and what does that have to do with OP sharing his tattoo?

How does thousands of other tattoos that are similar in style impact anything?

Tattoos have so many styles, that hundreds to thousands to millions to people are using.

Watercolor style.

Japanese Style.

Old-school Style.

Realism Style.

Black/White Style.

New/Old/ School Style.

Like... I don't understand your comment. People with tattoos can express their opinions with tattoo styles in any way they want - whether it's within a ""normie"" style or not."

AmItheAsshole,fetiwyj,t3_eqkznq,1579375910.0,"I would say INFO since without much context it’s hard to say. Like did she already tell you before hand? How often does she not text you when she’s out?

But ima go with NTA, since I’ve been in your shoes and my relationship ended horrible due to lack of communication. 

Sure everyone needs time away from their SO. We get it. But it seems like she doesn’t communicate this free time to you at all. Sounds like she doesn’t care about you in the way you care for her. 

A good and healthy relationship Is usually built on honesty and good communication. Since she got mad at you for expressing your concern; she obviously doesn’t care. I’d leave the relationship if I were you, she isn’t worth it. 

If she mentioned to you that she’s hanging out with her friends. Or she’s doing so-so for the next few hours. Then you could be TA. Even if she’s posting on social media, doesn’t mean she’s texting others. 

Again, not really enough info or context to go off of."

Meanwhile, OP's sister is acting all high and mighty because she got cosmetic surgery to make herself look better.

If to him, her surgery made it seem like it made no difference, then she has no fucking reason to fat-shame anyone or act like a bitch to people she doesn't even know - she deserve that slap in the face.
