Now with a booming economy and most living remarkably better lives the impeachment looks bitter and political instead of evidentiary.

Trump bribed someone but no one received quid pro quo and they didn't do what he wanted them to? That's why you want me to fire the man that has brought prosperity to my community?

Pretty soon the populace will turn on Democrats. We're likely headed for a Trump landslide victory and Republicans retaking the house.
