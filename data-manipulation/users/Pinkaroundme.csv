medicalschool,ffh9jcw,t1_ffh8i2q,1579927046.0,"Fair enough, that’s why I’m keeping options open. I haven’t even gone through rotations yet, but I have done a weekly rotation at a FM clinic for my M2 year, and the only procedures I did or saw done was Pap smears. The doctor that I worked with on a weekly basis had a long conversation with me about the lack of procedures he does. That’s what I based my comments on

Having said that, I don’t think it’s a problem to say now I don’t want to do certain specialties because of my own preferences but also to keep my options open. 

Not everyone’s med school experience is the same."
medicalschool,ffh65xd,t3_estwnj,1579924195.0,"Honestly, sounds like classic M1 bullshitting to their own peers. No one has a right to tell you or anyone else that their choice of specialty isn’t right because you aren’t helping people. That’s wrong"
medicalschool,ffh5uou,t1_ffh5pua,1579923945.0,"Gee, thanks for that confirmation"
medicalschool,ffh5ig1,t1_ffh51ov,1579923678.0,"Clarification for you - if I absolutely had to choose a primary care residency, I’d choose IM because I would have opportunities for growth that I’m interested in, specifically fellowships in cardio or GI, or something similar. However, I also wouldn’t have any gripes with remaining an IM with no fellowship. Yeah, there are fellowship options in other primary care residencies, but I wouldn’t be content as one of the others. Does that clear it up? 

Keep in mind, I’m not saying anything is wrong with other primary care practice, just that I’m not interested in them. Is that a crime?"
medicalschool,ffh46k8,t1_ffh415n,1579922639.0,Whoops.. the careers in medicine program from AAMC is is slowly getting replaced from my mind with step 1 studying. My badddd
medicalschool,ffh3bkx,t1_ffh0hs3,1579921968.0,"Honestly a lot of primary care doesn’t appeal to me just because I want to do procedures. I like working with my hands. Like many chipper M1s entering med school, I wanted to go into Ortho, but I also don’t want to kill myself in residency.

So, family med is out, pediatrics is a no go for me because parents (and.. kids). Idk if Ob/Gyn counts as primary care, but I’m not interested with it, specifically because of the goddamn annoying anatomy of all of it. Just something I can’t wrap my head around tbh. Reproductive anatomy, especially the whole area of the anal fossa and perineum and all that disgustingness in there just isn’t for me, and I also don’t want to work with vaginas tbh.

IM would allow for some specialization via fellowship, maybe Neuro or something, idk. EDIT: Not neuro as a PGY3 pointed out to me, thank you :)

More recently I’ve been interested in PM&R and gas, specifically for Pain Medicine just because I like that stuff."
medicalschool,ffgspxv,t1_ffgsiyx,1579914086.0,"Fair enough, could’ve worded it better."
medicalschool,ffgpb6c,t1_ffgn6d3,1579911636.0,"Sorry, my initial comment said the only one I’d want to go into is IM. By that I meant that’s the only primary care worth going into at this point in my own opinion just because you can reach into so many fellowships. If that take on it is wrong I’d love to hear your opinion"
medicalschool,ffgh4kt,t1_ffgg51h,1579906108.0,"I don't think it's a bad time to go into primary care. Personally, the only primary care field I'd go into is IM. An NP's role in primary care depends on what your State says their scope of practice is. Mid-level creep has been going on for a while, but a lot of primary care doctors I've spoken to don't have any problem with it.

I have heard problems from some gas residents about CRNAs tho lol"
medicalschool,ffgewdg,t1_ffff5t7,1579904691.0,Wow I honestly couldn't even imagine. That's a fuckin deal-breaker for me. I didn't even apply to certain schools because alumni told me I'd have to keep a clean shaven face for med school.

No way in hell would any EMTs allow someone on a stretcher to rip off a cervical collar like that and risk paralysis especially after a rollover. 

I’m nitpicky about medical writing stuff so this and the pepper thing kinda threw me off. Not to disrespect anyone who is gonna enjoy this series, though"
911LoneStar,ff22nm9,t1_ff22is4,1579492145.0,"Yeahhhhh but to say the patient ate a hot pepper and suddenly had Boerhaave syndrome is just... very wrong. Again, it’s due to severe vomiting which wasn’t mentioned"
911LoneStar,ff22c5v,t3_er0vf7,1579491903.0,"Sorry, but unless Michelle is a doctor, I don’t expect her to be able to diagnose a Boerhaave syndrome patient and properly treat it if she’s an EMT. Further, an esophageal rupture is different than Boerhaave syndrome, which is due to severe severe severe vomiting. 

An EMT generally wouldn’t be able to diagnose and treat that, especially just by looking down their throat. Ruptures usually occur a few cm proximal to the stomach."
