These people are running what appears to be their own private prison compound that no one's been able to search inside of. They are literally suspected of keeping members against their will as slaves, and nothing is being done about it.

The difference with the mafia is that they were running criminal enterprises that interfered with everyone's lives, while Scientologists only do things to their own members and to people who speak out against them. Scientologists aren't shooting people on the street or selling drugs, and they have more money and lawyers than the mafia ever did."

So if an agent's family member starts being followed or something like that, the agent can suspect there's a connection, but good luck proving it. If a pissed off agent decides to ""shove a light in every possible orifices"" as the commenter said, then the agency can expect a huge lawsuit that they will lose."

They have successfully fought off federal criminal investigations before. They were investigated for human trafficking  and nothing came of it.  Agents couldn't even fully search their properties when they wanted to.  Endless money and an army of lawyers will do that for you.

They've been suspected of serious crimes against *people* for decades.  No animal cruelty case over a couple of dogs is going to do shit to them. If they caught the guy who poisoned the dogs, there would be no way to prove he was being directed by the organization. It would be just one guy doing it on his own as far as the law is concerned, because no way would he admit he did it for them."

Also, you are making an uninformed assumption when you say that both problems will be repaired equally quickly.  This is not true at all.  I have worked in building management and I know from experience that they will prioritize service calls based on how essential the issue is.  Major issues that affect safety such as a pitch black elevator will get fixed immediately.  Small service lights are a lower priority and may be dealt with during their next routine maintenance to save costs.

Also, an overhead light may be able to be fixed immediately by onsite building maintenance, but those lights inside the panel must be fixed by the elevator company."

When the small lights go out, they often stay that way for longer because it is not a high priority.

The other one I read about was not working for a long time but they did not know what the problem was. It is not that they ""forgot to turn that light on"". The people riding it are not able to turn it on. It has to be fixed by professionals."

Obama's program was better than nothing for most people, but it had some problems too. I think there has been a failure of branding that they are finally getting better at by referring to it as ""Medicare for all"".  That is what they should have done all along, because it is an accurate description and Medicare is a very popular program, even among the people who say they are against government run healthcare."

So I would argue that if we have no choice but to pay taxes, then the least we deserve in return is healthcare. Healthcare is a *need*, not a luxury. Why have any government at all if they aren't going to take care of basic human needs?

His absurd argument could also be said for countless other things that the government pays for with our taxes, like a police force, the military, roads, schools, etc.   Are those human rights? I think it's beside the point.

As an American, I dream of being able to go to the doctor without worrying about what it will cost me. In the US, the majority of all personal bankruptcies are because of medical bills. Some people have been using Uber instead of ambulances because they can't afford the ambulance.  It's insane that this would be going on in a wealthy country, but we have privatized healthcare and this is the result.

Sure, there could be a better system but it's not likely to be better for people than publicly funded programs because when you privatize something, you introduce the profit motive and they will naturally fight to make it as profitable as they can.  It is a terrible idea to have that kind of moral hazard in healthcare."
