Maybe you went a little far, but my mom would never have send me off to a hotel swimming party to stay over night when supervision isn’t clear and all that. I would not send my child to sleep over either. Maybe pick them up. You are a good parent. What is wrong with this guy? His reaction is weird and for me communication when it comes to the safety of kids is essential."
