Burma usually met India's food shortfall (although not fully, malnutrition was common for decades previous due to socioeconomic inequality). Burma was under Japanese occupation. Worse, over a million refugees from Burma were living in Bengal.

Shipping in the region became dangerous, with hundreds of thousands of tons of cargo lost around to Japanese air cover.

Because Japanese invasion was likely for some time beforehand, as well as local natural phenomena like cyclones and monsoons, Indian provinces were warned as early as the mid 1930's that they needed to do more to be self-sufficient or stockpile in case of emergency....

....An emergency like The Bengal cyclone of 16 October 1942 which destroyed thousands of square miles of cropland, slaughtered wholesale cattle and beasts of burden needed to work the land effectively, and depopulated agricultural villages which were net suppliers of foodstuffs. That followed by a winter that killed 20 - 25 % of surviving crops.

While all that's going on the Indian provinces thought it was a good idea to shut down inter-Indian grain and rice trade. This was such an important factor that there are still debates over if India as a whole had a food shortage, or if the issues was primarily an inability to move foodstocks into high population centres like Bengal, Calcutta particularly.

As the situation was getting worse but before the deathtoll had started to ratchet up, predictions for a total disaster in 1943 were largely ignored by the Bengali government, who doubted the veracity of poor forecasts as 'poor guesses' and thus made no effort to stockpile or encourage continued farming amongst the previously self sustaining small agricultural communities who were selling off their land to feed themselves after the natural disasters only for the land to become unproductive and unused.

Then finally as the famine got bad cycles of food seizing and incompetent centralisation by the Bengali government effectively destroyed the already unstable food market, making traders unwilling to admit how much food they had in sharp contrast to the contemporary British rationing measures.

As for British aid, as was firmly stated at the time shipping was short. The Atlantic War still very much on the side of the Germans, preparations for D-Day, the loss of several major Asian logistics centres of the Empire, all meant that moving large amounts of cargo in the region needed to be well justified. The provincial government made petitions for more food, but never declared a state of famine which would have guaranteed those imports were made.

As for the common 'they were taking all the food' claim. All food exports began to cease in mid 1942 as the scale of shortage began to become apparent. The famine itself was at its worst in 1943 months after the last official export was made. By the start of 1943 the Empire was directly supplying grain to Bengal only to have much of the supply nepotistically redirected by provincial government workers or dumped onto an already failed open market which those in need couldn't hope to afford (again, in sharp contrast with Britain's own rationing scheme which had already seen the starving island control similar price spikes effectively. Preventing socioeconomic inequality from pushing the lower end of society below survivable intake levels).

WAR CABINET 43 (44) - has some nice discussion. Churchill shows concern for the situation, but still cannot authorise more assistance due to regional military pressures. This is supported by a number of military heads.

WAR CABINET 65 (41) - shows that the regional governors were supplying misleading figures for harvest and distribution, as India was receiving more grain aid than it should have needed.

WAR CABINET 8 (43) - contains the quote ""Peace, order and a high condition of war-time well-being among the masses of the people constitute the essential foundation of the forward thrust against the enemy….The hard pressures of world-war have for the first time for many years brought conditions of scarcity, verging in some localities into actual famine, upon India. Every effort must be made, even by the diversion of shipping urgently needed for war purposes, to deal with local shortages….Every effort should be made by you to assuage the strife between the Hindus and Moslems and to induce them to work together for the common good."" which shows how seriously he took the matter in official settings despite acting crass in less formal occasions.

India's Famine Commission Report (1945) - Looks back at the event with hindsight and lays out the factors behind it.

1940 Report of the Land Revenue Commission of Bengal (Government of Bengal 1940b) - is a good place to start looking at the warnings given before the famine, and how it could have been avoided. There were similar reports through the 30's too, but the 1940 one is the most intensive look and isn't outdated by the time of the famine itself.

If anyone was the blame it was the regional prince's... and Viceroy Wavell.

 And the Japanese.

But that doesn't fit with the uneducated circlejerk. If people really wanted to hate Churchill/Britain for actions in India they'd look up the Fabric Famine, but that would take more effort than repeating the same baseless factoids that already circulate.

I'll add to this the conversation between Roosevelt and Churchill when Churchill requested American aid to move food shipments into the region from British stockpiles in Australia. The request read:

> ""I have had much hesitation in asking you to add to the great assistance you are giving us with shipping but a satisfactory situation in India is of such vital importance to the success of our joint plans against the Japanese that I am impelled to ask you to consider a special allocation of ships to carry wheat to India from Australia….We have the wheat but we lack the ships. I have resisted for some time the Viceroy’s request that I should ask you for your help, but… I am no longer justified in not asking for your help.""

and the reply from Roosevelt:

>""unable on military grounds to consent to the diversion of shipping….Needless to say, I regret exceedingly the necessity of giving you this unfavorable reply""

Source, Prime Minister’s Personal Telegram T.1176/4 (Churchill papers, 20/165)
This reply came after American efforts had begun to nullify Japanese naval presence in the region, and after the Battle of the Atlantic peaked in mid-1943. So merchant fleets were theoretically more available than when the famine was at its worst. In the end British merchant shipping did transport those stockpiles, although it took significantly longer and significantly more losses to do so without assistance."

The UK was supplying the region with grain for almost all of '43, having reversed the trade over the latter half of '42, having already slashed demand due to the inter-provincial grain trade being shut down by regional and provincial government before there even was a shortage (directly causing regional shortages by preventing grain from flowing from national stockpiles into urban centers like Bengal) and maritime supply routes being at the mercy of Japanese convoy raiders."

worldnews,fgioh56,t1_fgimva5,1580827234.0,"Dude. You claimed ""there is no different point of view about the causes of climate change."" and that's categorically false. There are a wide range of views ranging from those which dismiss secondary emissions as irrelevant to overall trends to those which see them as more important than primary effects. That matters. That vastly changes how and why consumers can effect the overall situation. As an example pushing food miles increased some food products environmental footprint due to local production of stuff like tomatoes requiring heated polytunnel and constant irrigation while imported tomatoes can grow outside year round. Shifting agricultural areas also caused a spike in deforestation and other land use change as markets adapted to bood production in historic resource sinks. Yet air miles are an important step towards net-0 as they're impossible to mitigate with current technology unlike sustainable agriculture whi h can negate the damage of local production. It's important. It has a range of opinions and they're all backed by scientific review. But which one is a greater cause of climate change can be rigorously debated for years without a final answer.

Even simple questions like 'what would the climate be today without human intervention?' cause massive debates. We don't know exactly how much we have effected the climate, or how much is a direct effect and how much is due to breaking tipping points that triggered systematic changes. We can work out models and make educated predictions, but it's still a debate. 

These are important questions. Their answers determine if the current political goals for reaching Net-0 as well as regulation on ecosystem protection / regeneration are enough to prevent major changes to the planet. They determine if we need to speed up, if we're already too late and need to prepare for major disasters, or if we have plenty of time to do it right instead of implementing potentially damaging temporary solutions (freaking, hydroelectric, wood pellet reactors... Etc all spring to mind).

In the context of this thread, think about what happens if you lose the ability to speak against the governments targets either to call for faster or more permanent change? If you implemented that twenty years ago it would have been illegal to even suggest electric cars are the future, until the government made them part of the plan.

But you won't read this. It threatens your worldview that everything is simply 'known' and debate makes one side evil while the other get to be 'good'. You watched the news and it told you what to do what to say what to think what to ignore. Well done."
worldnews,fgifpmd,t1_fgid6rr,1580820157.0,"That's the broard view, but specific causes are with dely debated. Are direct emissions more important than land use change or indirect effect? Is the tipping point at 2°c or 4 or 6 or 8? Is that over 5 years, 10, 15, or does timescale not matter? At current rate do we hit that in 12, 20, 30, 40, or 50 years? Should such a question take planned mitigations into account or not? Can geoengineering or atmospheric engineering projects have a sizable effect on a global system? Does forestry remediation work better than scrub rewinding? Are biodiversity protection, biomass preservation, or climate control the most pressing target? Will migration pattern shifts mitigate or increase biodiversity losses? Is the effect of green corridors greater than contained reserves of the same size or social cost? Does a mean global increase translate to more variable or simply warmer/colder temperatures at extreme ranges? Will the NAC shut down or reverse? If so, at what point and is it reversable? What does that mean for ENSO propagation or will the NAC emulate ENSO with frequent reversals leading to temporary extreme climate effects?

These are all legitimate questions. They're all unanswered questions. Some have a general consensus behind them, but not so much that the scientific community deems them known. Yet they all have vast implications for how and when climate change, and its effect on human risk factors, must be managed.

But you've proven my point exactly. Based on news reporting you're not even aware of any of this. To you it's all a monolith of curtain facts with zero discussion to be had.

As for cherry picking, I'll go controversial. Remember a few years ago when everyone made a big claim of ""12 years to net-0 or everyone dies!"" based on an IPCC report? You probably do, it was a favourite chant of ER and AOC and a few other 'green' groups who have no idea what they're arguing and only serve to damage the environmental cause with disinformation. Try reading the report. It does say 2030 as a worst case possibility based on a worst case scenario. Effectively the 'if we do nothing' date. But in the model that took into account planned and reasnoble mitigations as well as remediation that date pushed back to 2050 or as far as 2075. 32 or 57 years respectively. Those are the dates the IPCC calls factually evidenced not 12 years, so they were the dates policy was based on. It also didn't quantify net-0 in the normal manner, being interested in a global-0 that took a natural baseline as 0 rather than an anthropogenic 0. Again, chasing how policy prioritised mitigation and remediation targets.  
The people claiming '12 years to the end of the world' were as wrong as the morons that claimed the same report said we had until 2200, which was also supported only by the most extreme edge case scenario but was not a conclusion of the report."

Domestic slaves may be treated well, though were usually free for sexual service by their masters in most regions. Pawns were often freed upon the repayment of debt without haste or bother. But chattel slaves were treated as dogs and god help you if you were taken by a roaming warlord.

The Kingdom of Dahomey literally just beheaded a few thousand slaves each year to gain blessings from their ancestors. They toned it down in the seventeenth century so only the King needed to ceremonially behead slaves for the nation to gain favour. They also slaughtered slaves when the old king died. Or a new king got crowned. Or to celebrate a successful war. Or to seek forgiveness after a disaster. Or because it was a Tuesday really.... Basically don't be a slave anywhere near what is modern Benin.

You probably don't want to do military service as a slave either. If you end up in the Arab Slave Trade you're probably getting castrated with a heated blade and if you're lucky you'll stand guard over their harem of slave wives instead of getting sent to die in Eastern wars. And for the love of all that's good don't be a Galley slave for Barbar pirates (fun fact: literally the origin of the word 'barbaric'). That means getting shackled to your seat and worked to death if you're lucky. If you're unlucky you won't die. You'll just spend years eating, shitting, sleeping, and rowing in the same exact seat... hoping that your ship is destroyed so you can drown in it too. But galley slaves were mostly white, being that European trade was the primary target of piracy and most chattel slaves came from successful military ventures, so we don't talk about them... or the rest of the 3 million chattel slaves estimated to have been imported into Northern Africa from Europe between 1450 to 1700."

blursedimages,femcumf,t1_fematub,1579249028.0,"Marx's class analysis yielded three definite predictions. First, it predicted that the proletariat would both increase as a percentage of the population and become poorer: as capitalist competition progressed, more and more people would be forced to sell their labor; and as the supply of those selling their labor increased, the wages they could demand would necessarily decrease. Second, it predicted that the middle class would decrease to a very small percentage of the population: zero-sum competition means there are winners and losers, and while a few would consistently be winners and thus become rich capitalists, most would lose at some point and be forced into the proletariat. Third, it predicted that the capitalists would also decrease as a percentage of the population: zero-sum competition also applies to competition among the capitalists, generating a few consistent winners in control of everything while the rest would be forced down the economic ladder.

Yet that was not how it worked out. By the early twentieth century it seemed that all three of the predictions failed to characterize the development of the capitalist countries. The class of manual laborers had both declined as a percentage of the population and become relatively better off. And the middle class had grown substantially both as a percentage of the population and in wealth, as had the upper class.

Ironically all three would accurately characterize the Soviet Union where the traditional middle and upper class were replaced a much smaller political upper class, while manual labourers became abundant and less well compensated for their work. 

Marx also predicted that these communism-driving negative effects of capitalism would be most prominent in developed nations where technological advancements reduced demand for agricultural labourers and allowed a greater percentage of the population to become urbanised. Thus also failed to materialise as the revolution would eventually come from Russia, an agrarian society with minimal industrialisation that was trying to advance towards economic development.

Dude, trends are more than one year. The downward trend had been fairly consistent since the 80's, barring redefinition that widen reporting criteria. The overall trend is also largely irrelevant to the core issue, that a very small portion of the population is being imported by government policy while also being responsible for such a disproportionately large proportion of the rapes. It points to a lack of cultural assimilation at best, or a total cultural incompatibility at worst. The Swedish government believed the former and instituted a range of sexual norms awareness classes and consent training programmes for freshly arrived migrants, then stopped releasing the data that would show if they were effective or not. That is to say the official position of the government supports the claim that migrants were disproportionately responsible for sexual crimes, and they instituted specific targeted measures to control that issue.

If the GPS system doesn't get a hard lock on the third satellite it can do pretty much anything. Consistently putting you 10 metres north of the road, seen it. Show you driving around a car park instead of across it (at 80 in a 30 zone apparently), seen it. Record you doing 50 through a one-way alley barely wide enough for the truck. Yeah, that's in the data. 

Even if the speed limit was correctly recorded by GPS, there's a whole host of other issues like finding the correct road speed for the road network (in real time, taking into account all changes to the signage and any temporary changes from roadworks/closures), non-road accessways that seem to be tagged onto roads by the GPS systems internal self-correction mechanism.

To do it properly would require a black box connected to the cars speedometer, and a dashcam for verification. The cheap and dirty backup is just a dashcam although that won't provide an exact speed just a visual clue. Those both cost money and destroys Uber's last hope of claiming its drivers as contractors rather than employees."

Because America just killed Iran's #2 and conclusively told them to chill the fuck out with their proxy attacks on US assets in the region or face wrath and damnation, and Iran rattled their sabre for the home crowd launching a telegraphed attack designed not to inflict casualties, then backed down in a way that was completely subservient to US interests while doing the barest minimum needed to keep their own population appeased.

Trump won this one. He won big, and he did it without dragging America into an unpopular war right before election season. Why would he not act consolidatory to maintain the current peace?

Saying Iraq didn't have WMD's would have been banned is the bigger issue. Anti-War protesters would have been banned in their masses for going against the warhawk governmental narrative. Even now, it is official record that the United States Government genuinely believed Iraq was in possession of WMD's despite releasing *suggestory* evidence that these claims were fabricated. There's no conclusive evidence to the contrary, just lots of circumstantial. Even now, to say the war in Iraq was conducted based on a deliberately false casus belli would be categorised as a false fact (despite being true, and generally accepted) if your standard of evidence is confirmatory proof.

Worst case scenario, this gets used in a highly bias manner. One party gets to make all kinds of ridiculous claims without scrutiny while labelling their lies as 'fact checked' while the other side cannot advertise anything because even rigorously researched and truthful facts can be 'disproven' with sufficient effort. 

To use just real examples:

NPR rated Trumps claim the 2019 congress housed a record number of women as false, while also admitting that the 2019 congress housed a record high number of women. Why you ask? Because the majority weren't Republican women so Trump had no right to mention it.

Politico rated the claim ""1 in 3 women in migrant caravans are raped or sexually assaulted while heading north"" as false, because it was only 31% of women.

NPR rated the claim Clinton ""Acid washed her hard drive"" as false, ""because the software name as Bleach Bit""

Washington Post declared Bernie Sander's claim ""Three people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of America."" as false, because they disagree it was even possible to compare capital owners (the rich) to debt owners (the poor).

 WaPo also declared his claim ""500,000 Americans will go bankrupt this year from medical bills."" as false, because they claimed it had no source. It was directly lifted from a peer reviewed article in the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH)

And for my absolute favourite way back in 2012 Ted ""Please Clap"" Cruz stated that the US Debt was larger than the US GDP. That is factually true and unarguable. The debt at the time was $16trillion and the nations GDP was $15.6trillion (now stay with me here, 16 is more than 15.6). Politifact rated the claim only as 'half-true', stating their reasoning as being because the average person doesn't know know what is meant by national debt or GDP and so may become confused.
