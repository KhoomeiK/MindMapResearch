DomesticGirlfriend,ffbxgz6,t3_ess9jv,1579785922.0,"Are they serious? It's just a story, move on! Hina isn't even fucking real."
DomesticGirlfriend,ff4z5pp,t1_fewi6qf,1579575969.0,"I'm glad I was not the only one who saw Hina as that. I think Hina tries to be good because she think she is good. But she doesn't realize the setbacks she put on herself by hovering around Natsuo. Ok, he almost died because of Misaki but that was just a random (imo stupid) drama or fluke. She didn't need to live with him, he literally says chapters earlier he wanted to be his own man and live alone, so what does she do? There are too many times where her character is just used to further plot and be the fanservice cocktease. You don't say you're a big sister and then sleep naked in front of your brother. Excuses excuses excuses! I love her but damn."

DomesticGirlfriend,feiwmda,t1_feig2z6,1579149219.0,"It will heal eventually, I promise."
DomesticGirlfriend,feiwjsi,t1_feicnll,1579149163.0,"Either way I do not see her with Shu, but he has changed and may deserve a second chance. He never, purposefully tried to hurt her."
DomesticGirlfriend,fegtyoh,t1_fefyqch,1579102475.0,"I don't know if Hina will really end up with Shu. Other then him showing up a few times, there are no reason being given that she still loves him. She doesn't even think of him or make a huge scene when she sees him again. I'm not sure what her fortune means but her romantic dreams may not be what we think."
DomesticGirlfriend,fefqee5,t1_fefp8wg,1579062238.0,"Thank you, it was right there at the tip of my tongue. I was scared of getting it wrong, I'm not good with memorizing chapters."
