I remember watching the clip on YouTube a couple years ago and half the comments were roasting George Lucas for having a cheesy script where the actor would laugh while saying this line.

The sweeping seconds hand is only in mechanical and automatic watches, quartz watches will tick. There are slight exceptions to the rule like the Seiko Spring Drives that has a hybrid of a quartz and automatic movement, but that's the exception to the rule and definitely not the norm

>You're not the only one you're making this decision for. What about your kids? They'll be the people you'll love more than anyone else in the world. Will you be able to forgive yourself for knowingly giving them a terrible mother?

this isn't something I've actually considered. I was in a (very brief) relationship a while ago and she really wanted kids. I'm pretty sure she saw it as a way to gain control over an incredibly chaotic childhood. In a ""if I give some kids a proper childhood, it'll negate everything I went through"" kind of way. She truly believed that she would have been a fantastic mother and I never had the heart to point out otherwise.
