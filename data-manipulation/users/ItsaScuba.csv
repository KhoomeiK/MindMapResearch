Now they're tight jeans pulled down or jeans deliberately too small. 

Not only how can you run? But how do people that talk about street violence who also have this style hide a gun properly? Atleast we had big pockets."

The difference is you have seen things before with your functioning eyes. Blind people who haven't seen anything wont have any inference, other then their imagination, of what things actually look like.

Your visuals will be influenced by different realities of sight."

AskReddit,fecl66x,t1_fecil10,1578976623.0,"Yea If they knew they were sterile I'm sure it would come up early on when asking important questions to test the longevity of the relationship, but we would have most likely already established something of a relationship in order to reach those hypotheticals. So depending on where we are and the level of perceived compatibility ot may or may not be a deal breaker. 

And I'm sure that if we're far enough in the relationship where we discover shes sterile due to negative result trials, then I'm sure I already love this person enough for it to not matter. We can adopt.

However, for a transwoman the option for bearing children is currently impossible. If/once that tech/science is available the conversation would most likely change."
AskReddit,fec8eph,t1_fec57fh,1578968452.0,"I'm also not attracted to trans women per se, but mainly only because the technology and science isnt fully developed. 

However, if everything looked and reacted as if they would with a natural woman, if there was an attraction I think I'd be comfortable with some exploration. 

I dont plan on having children but I would like that option with someone who I would be committed to. It's really a matter of time before they develop wombs for men."
relationships,fe6fulz,t3_envth0,1578889632.0,"Im speaking from personal experience but it Sounds like he has really bad anxiety.

Although I'm not a hoarder, I'm quite the opposite actually, I used to freak out if I couldn't find something. It was an absolutely nightmare for me with emotions that ranged from despair to pure rage. 

It took a long time to find out that was just a manifestation of my anxiety. And it can be caused by an infinite amount of stressful factors.

Anxiety isn't always about being nervous or worried. It's literally just an overactive fight or flight response which normally is only activated in moments of perceived danger. 

Anxiety is basically making your brain think it's under attack at all times. So usually, during a bear attack you will most likely run, but there may be an instance where you're cornered and need to fight.

Unfortunately for individuals suffering from anxiety there is no bear, running is not an option because you're already home and in presumably the safest place your brain knows, so now you're cornered but the only thing to fight is a the dry wall that will crumble beneath your fist giving you the feeling that you have won in battle.

If he's aware of a problem, not necessarily what it may be or why, but wants to make changes I would get him to a mental health practitioner.

Most people who do ""bad"" things aren't bad people, they just need some help."
