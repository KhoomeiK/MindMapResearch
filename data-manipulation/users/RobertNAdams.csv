This chafes with the reality that Gates relied upon collaboration with others to garner his success. You could be an idea man your whole life but suffer from poor execution without the proper associates.

Sure, fair point.

What about the billionaires that started with practically nothing or (comparitively speaking) very little?

Bill Gates' parents were successful, sure. They weren't billionaires. He is.

I mean, his dad was a lawyer and his mom served on corporate boards, so she was definitely a business type. Let's be generous and say that their family was worth like $10 million when he was starting out with business stuff at the age of 17 (that's around 1973–1974 if my math is correct).

Out of all of the people in the world in the mid-70s, how many of them do you think could have turned $10 million into nearly $100 billion in around 50 years? Nevermind leading a company that created the world's most popular operating system for personal computers.

Most of the time, these extremely-wealthy people are the sole decision-makers for their company.

Did some of them bend or break laws to their benefit? Probably.

Did some of them bribe politicians, either overtly or covertly, legally or illegally? Probably.

Did they have help from workers and colleagues along the way? Absolutely.

But at the end of the day, the decision to do A or B, move left or right, buy or sell — it rested with them. The sum of their decisions led to more success than failure.

AOC worked in a bar. She managed to gain the favor of voters by being more appealing to voters than her Democrat opponent in the primary and her Republican opponent in the election.

Mark Cuban worked in a bar, too. He also started several businesses, failed _many_ times, and now is worth billions and owns the Dallas Mavericks after doing a lot of things right.

In terms of politics, AOC is far more successful than Mark Cuban. In terms of business, Mark Cuban blows AOC out of the water.

If someone stole my hypothetical property and I discovered it later, I'd make a police report.

If I encountered someone in my home or near my property and attempting to steal something, I would use force to deter them, up to and including lethal force if necessary.
