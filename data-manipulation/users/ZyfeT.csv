AskReddit,ffp0ajt,t1_ffovshz,1580083944.0,"Yah.  I think you and I differ wildly on the kind of interviews we run and the people we want working on our team and for our teams.  It sounds like you hire people that make high performers absolutely miserable.

Luckily with our difference in views, it's unlikely we will ever have to work together."
AskReddit,ffo75be,t1_ffn37je,1580074826.0,That's exactly why this interview question is terrible.   People bullshit with their little himble-brags and the interviewer gets nothing out of it.
AskReddit,ffmq7ll,t1_ffmpsmz,1580057836.0,"You can think whatever you like I guess.  Doesn't really change much.  The question is for the purpose it is for, and from my experience it works."
AskReddit,ffmpkh9,t1_ffmof0v,1580057589.0,"Yes, because it likely means that you are careless and overconfident.  If you cant even think of one mistake (it doesnt have to be objectively the BIGGEST, come on), then you are full of yourself and dont self reflect on your failures in order to improve.

I love to see interview questions doing what they are meant to do."
AskReddit,ffm3p0c,t1_ffkualg,1580047977.0,"Then the question did its job and weeded you out.

Better than the ""tell me a strength disguised as a weakness lololol"" nonsense that everyone can bullshit through."
AskReddit,ffm3edn,t1_ffl755g,1580047847.0,"You realize this guy knows ""the point"" of the question, but is pointing out how ridiculous it is.  

How about if we want to know what a candidate is working on, we just ask them.   Only an idiot would give an honest answer that would hurt them, and for a lot of people this question is an insult to their intelligence."
AskReddit,ffm2ix1,t1_ffk617b,1580047511.0,"Found the proper answer.

Fuck this joke of a question.  Any job that asks this is one that I dont want to work for.  It's a completely worthless question, as evidenced by the replies in this thread.

Question might as well be:  ""what's the best humble-brag that you can think of?  If none, then lie."""
reddeadredemption,ffjpecb,t1_ffitw17,1580003623.0,The clouds are most likely generated using an algorithm.  So making the tops look good isn't anymore work than just making the clouds themselves look good.

assholedesign,fff6bap,t1_ffe3nfi,1579876816.0,"The pictures all over the box clearly show tons of large blocks, and the box itself it huge.  

It's still completely misleading asshole design.

Wellthatsucks,ff1npn8,t1_ff1eoz0,1579482219.0,"Not really making a lot either.  100k when houses cost at least 600k really isn't that great.   Most city in canada where IT makes 6 figures will have housing costs like that.

And dont forget that's in Canada-bucks too, which is pretty much a joke.  100k cad is 70k usd"

Thanks for proving my point."
GetMotivated,fek52fy,t3_epgwc1,1579192772.0,"The graphic is terrible.  It shows that if one donkey is physically superior to the other that he could overpower and take both food sources (or at least 1 while and part of the other), which would be preferable to working with the weaker donkey.

This only works when both donkeys are identical in ability-which isn't an accurate representation of reality.

This might feel good to you, but to someone who might be already depressed and feeling worthless and as if they are lesser than others, this just runs in that fact more."

So please, try to explain your logic for not using credit cards one more time?

If your entire point is that we need to get every person to drop credit cards..  well buddy that's never going to happen.  Might as well get any benefits offered, better than nothing."
