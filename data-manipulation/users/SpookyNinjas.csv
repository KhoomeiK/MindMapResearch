It's possible that some people will be able to eat slightly more, but the difference isn't going to be that extreme. 

You can punch your stats in and measure exactly what your weight will be (well not exactly, but very close, close enough that the error is irrelevant). If OOP ate in moderation and exercise he'd lose weight. Chances are he wouldn't have to restrict himself that much either."
AskReddit,ffkl2d3,t1_ffkah6c,1580024536.0,"Wow. First of all the conditions your grandparents lived under have roughly nothing to do with your genetics (aside from extremely minor, imperceptible changes that occur in every generation). It will take several generations to make any difference (and even then that might not be enough). It takes hundreds and thousands of years.

Secondly, regarding genetics... I'm not going to say they have absolutely nothing to do with weight gain / loss. Especially when you consider appetite, there's  differences. That said, metabolism is going to be roughly similar, and pretty much everyone can lose weight. Doing some accurate calorie tracking will really dispel some of the mystery behind this stuff.

Of course, occupation, mental health, lifestyle habits, culture, and many many other things will affect weight and issues like obesity. Not trying to say it's anyone's fault, but it is possible to conquer weight loss, just like it's possible to conquer drug addiction. Not everyone wins the battle though, and I don't blame them."

I can handle being friends with somebody, and wasn't really considering it as an option. We're cool, but I couldn't help but feel bad (for her, but also kinda hurt). It sucks getting preemptively rejected when you aren't even trying. 

Still, I think there's a ton of guys that would jump on getting with the attractive friend if given the chance. It makes the whole dynamic a little weird. I see this with some of the attractive ""cool"" girls I know. It's like there's sharks circling them.

I never seriously answered your question though. I think that some people just can't help but catch feelings, and some guys are just caught up on attracting the best woman; their options are limited, and the lengths they have to go through to meet someone... That's kinda controversial, and I don't know what it's like for a lesbian (or straight women for that matter), but you gotta have this whole game plan  and run the field. Options are limited, and that girl you like hanging out with looks good.

That's no excuse, and it's different for everyone, I'm just trying to explain some of the psychological reasons. That's not necessarily limited to men, and some men definitely have no problem with platonic female friends. Women have issues with guy ""friends"" also, from time to time.

Basically we have these basic math operations. More complicated operations can be combined based on the simple ones. For instance multiplication is adding over and over. The simple operations can then be turned into a number, which the computer understands. It runs that through it's circuitry to get an answer.

explainlikeimfive,ffhejwa,t3_etm9we,1579931998.0,"At it's heart you can think of a computer like a programmable calculator. It can add, subtract, tell if two numbers are the same, bigger, or smaller, and do different calculations depending on the result (if bigger, do A, if smaller do B, and the calculations continue). More complicated operations can be done based on these simple ones. We humans have devised ways of describing behavior, and translating into those calculations. This is basically a programming language.

It would be tough for a five year old, but not impossible to just read one of these instructions for the computer, and figure out what it does. Some of them are pretty much the same as you'd see in code. ""C = A + B"", could be ""add A, B, C"", where A is the result, B and C are the values to add. This is then turned into a number that the computer understands.

How the computer understands this number isn't exactly easy for me to explain. It's quite complicated, even though the math is often very easy. The principle isn't that different from previously described though. We've figured out how to use electricity to do basic math. That number I mentioned is turned into the math.

Easy. To exist in society today without being a second class citizen, you need to drive. If you can't drive, you're basically the ward of someone else. Not everyone has someone out there that can just take care of them. There are rare exceptions, and they're usually partial (eg in big cities, you frequently encounter people with no car). 

If people could afford to travel, without being treated like garbage, or at least eccentric, I might feel differently. There was a movie where a running joke was that the main character uses a bike for travel as an adult. That's just the stigma, but stigma matters. There's all kinds of practical issues. I can't even ride a bike or walk through most of my city. It's unsafe, and people will throw things at me, or yell at me. I wouldn't be able to get to work or sustain myself without a car. That's not even touching things like socializing or transporting stuff (eg. groceries, you got to eat). Cabs and Uber are pretty un-affordable as a primary means of transport, even for people that are doing relatively well.

Regarding rights vs. needs, that's a personal opinion of mine, that most don't share. For instance I don't see food or medicine as a right, but a need, which the government should help protect. Rights are basic things like participation in government, protection from government abuse, and freedom from discrimination based on race, sex, ect. Most people would consider driving a right, if they don't make this distinction. I'd argue that some needs might even be more important than rights. eg. if you have no food, but are a citizen with full rights, it would probably be better for you to have less rights, but be able to eat. If you went long enough without food, you might even volunteer for slavery.

Anyway, that distinction is important to me, but I think these needs are important, and the government should help protect them. I think that people should be able to travel freely. Practically, you need to drive to do this. The only people I think should be banned are proven, habitual, extremely dangerous drivers. People that you just know are going to be a threat if you don't stop them. In the USA we have the habit of just pulling people's license (some of them don't even have any driving offense at all). Almost all of them drive anyway, and some just get unlikely ending up in a deeper mess."

He was known for being a cutthroat cunt in his early days; even if you weren't that tech savvy. He had his company broken up, and was involved in a bunch of shady practices.

personalfinance,ff84i2q,t1_ff6k1bd,1579665768.0,"No, that's ageism and illegal. If they find out about your age (I can't recall ever putting this on a resume), there might be some prejudice. However, they're really just going to see the graduation date as your professional start. There's a really good chance that it won't be an issue at all in the vast majority of your applications. It's possible that ""the gap"" might be noticed, and you'll be asked to explain. You should be able to come up with an explanation (I wouldn't mention mental health problems), and it should be pretty easy. 

There's nothing really too eyebrow raising here. It's all very ""shrug off-able"". The main risk is being unable to complete a program, and/or mismanaging your career (don't network, fail to gain practical experience, get a degree with poor ROI, ect). The problems are usually with gaps and firings in the middle to later part of the career. If you graduated 20 years ago and have an unexplained 5 year gap, that's pretty tough.

I think what your friends are (poorly) explaining is that engineers tend to have a bit of a ""shelf life"" when it comes to certain jobs. There may be these lucrative, exciting entry level jobs, but they want people fresh out of school for various reasons. Trying to pitch yourself into a junior position after 10 years in industry is tough, and in general you're not as sought after. Engineers tend to max out their salaries pretty early. Then they get pigeonholed into certain positions. Management and very industry specific specialized stuff. It can be tough to hit reset and go from programming airplane parts to writing software for the cloud. The industries and technologies can be so different and engineers don't always get sharper with age.

Like I said though, the start point is graduation. Your resume will read ""\_\_\_ University Graduated 2024"". It isn't even really that odd to graduate at 26 (starting at 18-20) and I knew students that were even older.

P.S. I use the term Engineer and programmer interchangeably here, but it applies to both. Pay tends to be a bit better for Software Engineers though."
personalfinance,ff82o7a,t3_erxp9e,1579664393.0,"Your chances are okay. 25 isn't really that late to get started. You'll probably need to accept some risk and pursue a career. These things aren't free. As for programming try it out. If you can crank out a few algorithms and programming problems (be patient, it might take a while), and learn not to hate it, programming might be for you. Otherwise, there's other disciplines with good ROI. See if you can get into a program, and you'll probably have to finance your education. This is very risky, but if you think you can do it, it's worth it."
Documentaries,ff80dv6,t1_ff7zikm,1579662726.0,"Can't really say for sure, but my guess is no. There's specific laws in place that counter sex trafficking. The way laws are frequently written these days is to make prosecution easier (not just in the US, I've heard criticism in countries with decriminalized prostitution, where pimping is still illegal). It's also a fine line, in fairness. Pimps will commonly make the excuse of giving a ride, being a friend, ect.

RICO was put into effect to counter organized crime. The problem was that gangsters could sit off in the shadow and call shots. They didn't actually participate, and could be tough to charge. While that might seem to fit, and it might even be used in some cases, it's not really what it's for. Typically, the guys they go after are very hands off and insulated. I would guess that they'd be charged with sex trafficking."

One of those faults is that he's extremely open minded and willing to listen to all kinds of crazy opinions. If you believe something because you heard it on his show you have bigger problems.

LifeProTips,ff7xmni,t1_ff7ph92,1579660783.0,"Seriously, me not making desired weight / reps is crushing. I get that it can be tough to convince yourself to do another set, or do a difficult exercise, but I very much want to finish my reps. I only stop, because if I'm worried that I might get hurt; I'd do 100 reps if I could (obviously, I'd up the weight before that)."
LifeProTips,ff7x9io,t3_es3ku3,1579660538.0,"Is this kind of ""motivation"" really necessary? I don't think that really effects me, except in certain situations. Pumping out one more rep isn't one of them. I'm pushing as hard as absolutely possible without risking injury. Believe me, I very much want to finish my reps, and would be overjoyed to get ""extras"". At least on bench, when I go to failure (with spotter), it's very rare that I don't know when I'm done, and am somehow able to get one more. If I even attempted another, I'd probably fail, my form would be bad, and overall it'd just be dangerous."

sports,ff7sv8y,t1_ff7n2oq,1579657539.0,"I think the main point is that there's a pattern of behavior that proceeds the exposure to CTE. I agree about humans not having free will. I'd even say we have none, not that we have ""very little"". We are just only able to recognize this in obvious cases, like PTSD, physical, or extreme emotional trauma (even then people have a tendency to refuse to entertain that kind of apologia.

sports,ff7s91z,t1_ff7ic5f,1579657111.0,"There is speculation that head injuries can cause this sort of behavior. There have been a couple specific examples that are at least somewhat compelling. Supposedly, there have been examples of a switch flipping and someone turning into a very different person. The truth of the matter isn't clear, because we don't know enough about the mind, and it's often used as an excuse for terrible conduct.

Of course, I'm being pretty weasly and not giving examples; I'd rather people look into it on their own. That said, there was an episode of radiolab (blame), and Sam Harris has an example he likes to use; there's others. Pretty sure I've seen it mentioned in Psychology publications, when I was going down that rabbit hole."
sports,ff7q984,t1_ff7k3eh,1579655724.0,"I don't think one big hit is what typically puts someone over the edge. Maybe it can, but it's really the repeated hits that gets people. Like 100s or 1000s of lesser hits, and 10s or 100s of hits like this. It's not just games, but also practice. Not every hit is as violent as it looks. There are likely some pretty routine blows that do more damage then they appear."
sports,ff7pz8f,t1_ff7ixjw,1579655528.0,"Eh, you might be surprised. There's some pretty outrageous conduct from football players. From the top, to lower levels, even amateur clubs and high school. 

Now most of the time players have too much to lose, and too little leverage. Could be AB thought he was big enough to get away with it. He was almost proven right. If it weren't for the sex assault claim, he was arguably playing the league like a fiddle, and masterfully manipulating his career.

I've personally heard stories of college players putting people in the hospital, and getting off with a slap on the wrist. Some of them mistreat women (sex assault and abuse). This guy on the club rugby team bragged that they get banned from wherever they throw their end of year party. There's lots of examples like this. Many people involved in sport wouldn't be surprised by his behavior in the slightest. The asshole jock stereotype didn't come from nowhere.

FWIW It's not just American football. You definitely see it in hockey, soccer, rugby ect. (I had stories for all of the above). Seems like the ""rougher"" sports are worse though."
