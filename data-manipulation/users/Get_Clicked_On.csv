So the person before only has X amount told to the insurance company because it was just a trailer before, so they are paying rates based on that, they would need to tell the insurance about the improved trailer to get coverage and the right rate to cover the new cost."

Always a good idea for auto insurance to keep any bills of major repair down so insurance can get the correct value if it crashes. The difference in value from a 2008 X is very different for a 2008 X with a new transmission put in last year."

I think when fighting lower tiers it will be great but vs Super C, 277, and others it feels like it will be stuck fighting in the city brawler and can't fight mediums with it's slow turret rotation and low top speed.

Because of my age I tend to just save money for  once a year deposits and then don't really move anything.

WorldofTanks,fcsrsww,t1_fcsnuj5,1577923483.0,"Both of these are not cheats. 

1. No cheat can make your armor more useful or keep your hp from dropping both of these are sever side. 

2. Aimbots don't make shots hit where you aim 100% of the time because RNG of 25% still is in effect. Aimbots in WoT can lead targets, autolock on and aim for weakspots but not make your shots go perfect, why aimbots are not useful 99% of the time. 

The only real cheats that matter in tanks is the mod that gets rid of bushes and the one that shows when things break on the minimap. As these help you shoot and move to the right location, not affect by RNG and not controled by the sever."
