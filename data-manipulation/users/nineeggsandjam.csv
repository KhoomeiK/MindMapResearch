todayilearned,ff72dma,t1_ff585qb,1579639740.0,"Why am I being down voted? I didn't mean anything rude or decrimenatory. Colour association is a thing. Ancient Egyptians associated red with vitality, fire, and blood as well as evil and destruction. His pyramid was originally white with a gold cap. White was associated with cleanliness and sacredness. I'm not sure what the gold meant but a quick google search tells me that it probably represented ""the power and wealth of the Pharaoh."" So his white, gold capped pyramid now being red would be rather annoying. It's like if someone showed up to a funeral wearing orange when everyone else is wearing black but on a much larger scale- it'd normally be considered inappropriate and maybe offensive because that's not what you traditionally wear when you're mourning."

AskReddit,fegz5cy,t1_fegufts,1579105751.0,"This is because I messed up people's gender pronouns too many times.

You could be someone I'd known for years that was born and remained a male and I'd accidentally call you by 'her' one sentence then revert back to 'he' the next.

AskReddit,fe6cgqv,t3_enu36l,1578886925.0,"Nothing too drastic. There was the highlighter incident, where I shoved highlighters up my vag, got the pink one's cap stuck inside, and ended up spending the next half hour trying to fish it out (turns out the best way to get stuff out is to squeeze not fish). All the fluids that came out of my vag the next day were tinted pink. There was also the time I walked my dog with one of those hotel mini shampoo bottles (that was emptied and washed) in my vag. That was stupid decision. It hurt when I had to bend down and I ended up cutting the walk short (I'm sorry Kiko, you suffered a short walk that day because your walker was a horny shortsighted teen). Visiting sketchy sites with lots of pop up's is probably the worst thing I've done out of horniness. I'm too cowardly and lazy to do anything really regrettable or out there."

australia,fd6fr1u,t1_fd5k8p6,1578190305.0,"Oh fair point. All this talk about the pronunciation of French names actually made me recall another story: I took high school French with a guy named Michael. Our teacher liked to say his name with a soft C because ""that's how the French would do it."" It was confusing as heck because the girl sitting behind him was named Michelle. Sometimes the teacher would point in their general direction, call on one of them, and watch as Michael and Michelle looked at one another trying to figure out who she was calling on.

So I guess I shouldn't have minded how Louis wanted his name to be pronounced and remembered all the names that are pronounced differently to the French. (That said, I still prefer ""loo-ee"" over ""Lewis"")"
