AskReddit,ffflhjc,t3_et8871,1579886535.0,I think my favourite has to be Austria’s/Germany’s Krampus. It’s kind of weird that the countries that rewards good children on Christmas by filling their stockings with treats also punish them by sheer f**king fear telling them a demon of unimaginable power will kidnap you and drag you down to goddamn hell!
