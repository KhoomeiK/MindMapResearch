SubstituteTeach,ff1u6mb,t3_er586s,1579486269.0,I subbed in a room the other day but Idr the grade and I kept getting compliments because the kids wanted to work with partners and move around the room and I kept saying no. I'm 21 F with this being my first year subbing but not my first year working with kids. It cracks me up so much that they just kept giving compliment after compliment trying to get me to say yes.
SubstituteTeach,fei209j,t1_fehqfsw,1579128540.0,"Honestly dude, you're good for rambling. I'm going for a teaching degree in mo and I think the lowest gpa you can have is like a 3.00 . Luckily my GPA is good enough but I can't imagine having to take that many classes to make up credit"
SubstituteTeach,fehq4rx,t1_fehpygl,1579121644.0,Some days it's definitely a challenge. It's hard to just walk in and pick up right where they left off at like they expect you to know what's going on... I am definitely thankful for this experience and the experience subbing gives as a whole. I'll be better prepared for when I'm a teacher.
SubstituteTeach,fehouw5,t3_eovisj,1579120908.0,I subbed today for a different room and it was a much better day! I only subbed half a day though since I still have homework for school to do otherwise I would've ended up in the same room as yesterday.
UlcerativeColitis,fec4uz5,t3_eoaym5,1578966678.0,"I was a week and a half away from turning 20 when I was diagnosed. It was definitely a struggle in the beginning to get to the point of feeling okay and feeling up to working, I worked anyways when I was absolutely miserable and I regret it cause I didn't allow my body to heal. 21 now, still full time college student and working as a substitute teacher which allows me to decide when I work and don't. I was really glad when I found this group, a discord group, and a few on Facebook. It definitely makes things a little easier to talk to people who can understand what you're going through."
college,fe3vq6b,t3_enpc4d,1578853291.0,"Sometimes. I made one friend at the beginning of my associates but now I have a different opinion on her. But yeah, sitting in classes now, sure I talk to everyone but actually having a friend? I don't. So I generally don't hang out with anyone on the weekend which gets lonely sometimes especially when I just want to get out of the house."
UlcerativeColitis,fe0ds9i,t3_enft9a,1578811157.0,"Ahhh I remember trying to play the where's this blood coming from game when I was waiting diagnosis. Now it's like stomach pain? Let's add some stabbing like cramps and even more back pain than normal. I swear, after a week, I feel like a superhero!"
college,fe0deww,t3_enj55m,1578810750.0,"Yes! The first semester is always the slowest but then 2nd semester, 3rd, and part of 4th semester (attended a community college for associates) went by super quick! And of course any summer courses I took went by quickly too.

Currently on my second semester at transfer school and it already feels quicker than my very first semester."
college,fdw6qqf,t1_fdqkqfw,1578755639.0,That kinda blows so did you get credit for the class?
IBD,fdspefy,t3_emzio8,1578706229.0,"Be prepared to answer how many bms you have, are they formed or loose, blood in the stool vs on tp or both, how much weight have you lost, any pain, where is the pain located, how soon after consuming something do you have pain, how long does pain last, does the pain happen after something specific such as gluten or dairy, or fibrous foods, any family history, etc.

You should ask about the recommended treatment plan or the different options, how often you will be having a colonoscopy, etc..."
college,fdm8nyc,t3_elzg04,1578542546.0,"I had major anxiety my last semester when I was getting my associates. My college offered free counseling to students so I met with a counselor who just helped me find ways to work through and cope with things that were going on. 

One app I found to be really helpful was Sanvello (play store) most of it's free. It helped me process my thoughts, offer meditation, and breathing techniques. 

I would check in and see if counseling is available if you feel like that would help you. I definitely don't want you to feel pressured into doing it if you don't feel comfortable with it. My boyfriend kept pushing me to and I wasn't ready but eventually I felt comfortable enough with it and did it"
SubstituteTeach,fdfvgx1,t3_el3aj5,1578371293.0,"The one and only day I subbed in middle school, 7th grade to be exact, I had a group of students who did this. I did have a seating chart but it was hard to read and follow since it was small. I didn't want to pick that fight so I just let it go and walked around their area a little more frequently than others and just stood there for a few extra seconds just to let them know that I was watching them. 

I'd say you did right thing and just let it happen. Honestly, that was my only problem that day and I was not in the mood to have a disagreement with a bunch of middle schoolers."
college,fdd0m0r,t3_ekdrod,1578290106.0,"Physical science all because the instructor forces us all (most were elementary education mjrs) to learn nothing but physics for 16 weeks while barely touching on the other aspects of physical science. He's also the type of instructor who knows way too much about the subject and not how to ""dumb it down"" to those who aren't majoring in science. 

When you'd answer his questions, he'd make fun of you or if you asked a question, he would make you feel stupid, repeat the exact same statement he already said in class, or just stare at you in silence (if in his office, he'd offer an organic mango chili sucker thing). 

His class was set up to where you would answer questions (ws) and read the text before class, turn in questions, take a quiz over the ws and text, turn in the quiz, go over any questions about the ws teach the actual lesson and then give a grade on those questions and quiz without making sure you understood what was going on... So unless you had a good understanding of physics you were screwed. I used my boyfriend a lot on my ws ( I ended up learning more from him then the instructor) while another student used her dad who was an engineer? Oh the best part? He encouraged you to not use the free tutoring offered by the college because, and I quote, they don't know anything, end quote...

He worked at NASA and left and is at a community college. There were many negative comments left about him on the eoc evaluation. He's also the only one to teach that course for non science majors."
college,fcouk9k,t1_fco6pum,1577841959.0,He's living 13 hours away from me while I'm still going through school.
college,fcnt4uv,t1_fcnqsc6,1577817913.0,Yeah he's in training with a few who have done the same thing and got the 4 year nuclear engineer degree and they are shocked they're in the same training and levels
college,fcmy5tb,t3_ei15wc,1577797313.0,I generally stick with 12 or 13 credit hours depending on the difficulty of the course. Sometimes I'll do 15 hours (about 5 classes) depending on the subject and where I'm at in by college career. I don't do more than 15 though since I work and have medical issues that are affected by stress.
college,fcmxone,t3_ei1gja,1577796790.0,"My boyfriend went through something similar with people telling him he shouldn't do what he wants to do. He wanted to be a nuclear reactor operator. It's a two year degree and the issue he had was his teachers telling him nah you can't do that or how are you gonna find a job and all this other nonsense. He graduated with his two year degree, found a job within 3 months and is enjoying what he does. He found this quote, ""No one cares, work harder."" He uses that as motivation because in the end no one really cares what you do as long as you do what you wanna do, you're gonna keep working hard to get what you want. 

People tell me all the time not to do teaching instead, I should do something easier or less stressful but to be honest, I'm the happiest when I'm doing things with education. 

After all that, all I have left to say is follow what you want to do. If doing research or anything related to bio is what you enjoy the most then go for it. You're the one who's going to be working that job not those who tell you you can't."
college,fcgv96e,t3_eh8h0c,1577644329.0,"I rented the ones that I needed for my AAT and the classes that weren't for my major. I'm going on 2.5-3 years of college/uni and am just now buying my books because I consider them actually helpful and useful. In that time, I've only bought two books that I don't need anymore. One I burned and the other I'm keeping bc others in my class will need it when they take the class (I'm in a satellite campus so we all pretty much have the same classes to take and we'll be graduating together). 

Anyways, if you can get away with it, rent or borrow books otherwise by used if possible unless you need an access code."
college,fcbtv4f,t3_egwl0j,1577590914.0,I'm starting to keep the books that are actually related to my major but all the other ones I've rented so all I had to do was return them or I've borrowed from a friend. In the rare case if having to actually by the book (which has only happened twice in 3 years) I'll mention it in my other classes like y'all know you're gonna have to take this class so I have the book for ya or I'll just burn it if I really hated the class or the instructor.
