RedLetterMedia,ffakvrw,t1_ffajitd,1579738297.0,"If you pay any attention at all to international affairs, the dysfunctionality of Bajoran politics --- and the difficulties the rich and advanced Federation encounters in trying to help them get their house in order --- is incredibly salient. Exploring this through a sci-fi lens was a wonderful continuation of Star Trek tradition.

If anything, real life Third World political dysfunction is often even more ridiculous than how DS9 portrayed the Bajorans."

RedLetterMedia,ff89ina,t3_es5adl,1579669990.0,"DS9 went to some dark places, but underneath everything it had a utopian, optimistic core: a heartfelt belief that if everyone just works together, all the seemingly intractable divisions and problems can be overcome, eventually. That's an element that's missing from other attempts at ""dark"" sci fi, including modern Star Trek.

One small example of this is that the crew of DS9 behave like professionals. You even see the Bajorans, who were terrorists/freedom fighters not long ago, trying hard to adapt to a new environment where they're part of a professional team in charge of running a space station. It's a huge difference from modern Trek where characters go rogue at the drop of a pin."

neoliberal,ff2epok,t1_ff291wm,1579503054.0,"What matters, at the end of the day, is the progressivity of the whole system. Consumption taxes are regressive, but they can (and do) serve useful roles in systems that are progressive overall. It's a bit silly to evaluate a tax-and-spending proposal by looking at the tax part in isolation.

Note, by the way, that the Scandinavian countries---the darlings of the American left---finance a huge chunk of their spending using VATs, as well as high income taxes on the middle class."
neoliberal,ff2bai1,t1_ff297nv,1579499470.0,"It's about the taxation *and benefits* system. Friedman explicitly talks about the political biases toward implementing highly specific benefits and carve-outs, and how that leads over time to an increasingly complex and unwieldy system."

neoliberal,ff1o3nd,t1_ff1ebih,1579482424.0,"Mathematically, a UBI combined with consumption/income taxation is equivalent to a cash grant that takes from the rich and gives to the poor. It automatically channels resources to those who need help.

Moreover, history teaches us that narrowly targeted benefits, like your schooling grants, often start out with good intentions and slowly morph into special-interest monsters that make no economic sense but are impossible to eliminate. See for example the mortgage deduction. In matters of taxation and spending, simplicity is a highly desirable quality in itself."
neoliberal,ff1bthj,t1_ff0thho,1579477263.0,"Why's that a neoliberal approach?

The thing about Singapore is that it's a city-state, and its government is a classic urban political machine. One party has entrenched itself in the civic life of a city, allowing it to choke off any viable opposition without needing to formally abandon democracy. It's actually a common story---there are US cities that have been run by a single party for longer than Singapore has existed as an independent country. But this kind of model is inherently limited to single cities or very small countries, and doesn't scale up to a country the size of China."

Foodforthought,fcll1ci,t3_ehl45u,1577750266.0,"If the left has the courage of its convictions, it should be arguing for *everyone* to pay higher taxes. The Nordic countries are often held up as a model to aim for, but what's notable about their economies is how heavily lower and middle income people are taxed. This includes very high VATs, which American leftists reflexively dismiss as regressive.

Without a broad tax base, you simply can't get to the high levels of government spending the left claims it wants. There are major limitations to trying to use the tax base for redistribution; there just aren't enough rich people you can soak to make any real fiscal difference, so it's just empty signaling. It is far better to have a simple tax code, stop worrying about making taxes progressive, then use social programs to get to the level of egalitarianism that is desired."
