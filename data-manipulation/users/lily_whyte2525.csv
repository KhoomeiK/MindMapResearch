vaporents,feg4mc4,t1_fefzy8h,1579076689.0,"I hear you. I'm an older person with a grandchild & I don't feel right about it around  her, including being high. 

I keep my weed & all paraphernalia out of site. She has never seen me vape.

But, I only have her a few times a week. So, I usually don't do it at all when she's here, or if I do, only when she's asleep for the night & I'm in another room.

I remember when my son was born though & I decided I wanted to be present for him in a natural state of mind, so I gave it up for 20 yrs. 

You sound like a responsible parent. I'm sure after some introspection, you'll find the answer that's right for you & your family. Good luck!"
vaporents,feg3r3w,t3_eowfwb,1579075596.0,"I'm kinda in the same boat as you, OP. Except, I started up again to see if I could get some pain relief as a medical marijuana user. 

I also purchased a Solo II last summer, my first vape. 

Since then, I've been experimenting with different strains, levels of THC & various cannabinoids.

I ordered something too high in THC or just smoked too much? & had a paranoid experience last month. So put it down for a few wks. I'm back to using it again but with a tried & true strain this time & so far so good.

When ordering online from medical sites, the marijuana goes by different names than typical commercial strains & their names. So it's a bit tricky trying to match up something I may have read about to what's available on the medical sites.

I just ordered THC softgels. I'm starting with a very low dose & will go from there.

There's so much to learn!

Good luck OP!"
medical,feg2n3i,t3_eopdjm,1579074235.0,"I would ask about their experience. If their main practice deals with endoscopy then I'm sure they'll have plenty of experience.

Ask what type of sedation will be used, some drs use twilight, full or no sedation at all.

Honestly, the prep before the procedure is the ""crappiest"" part."

He has tried all the medicated antiperspirants some work a bit better than others. His best bet would be botox injections but last time we checked, it wasn't covered by insurance.

Look for their scat. Check for openings around kitchen plumbing. You'd be surprised how tiny a space a mouse can fit through.

Don't leave dishes with food on them in the sink.
