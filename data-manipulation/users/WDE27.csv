He worked out (not a lot, maybe like 3 or 4 times a week), but he had really good genetics. He ate regular stuff (not completely healthy but not a ton of junk food), but still had abs and under 10% body fat. He dressed nice since his dad was rich, and he was really tan as well. I was always jealous of him because he could literally get any girl he wanted (not exaggerating at all), but now hes an alcoholic whos failing his way through college and never works out.

socialanxiety,fembqi9,t3_epvdn9,1579247566.0,"Thats how most girls do. If youre worried about texting too much, try to pay attention to how shes responding. If shes only giving one word responses, like yeah, cool, okay, or something to that effect, shes not interested in what youre talking about or doesnt want to text as much. Another strategy you can take is not texting her until you know youll have to stop texting for something. For example, start texting her at 1:30 if you have a class at 3:00. When class is about to start, say something like my class is about to start, Ill text you back later! You can do the same thing when you need to study or go to bed too. Just make sure not to do it too much. 

If theres a bright side to it, its that it makes it really special when she texts first. But whatever you do, please please please do not use an excuse to stop texting her if she texts you first. I made a similar mistake that Ill share to try to help you: I hadnt talked to or seen this girl who was my best friend in like a month and a half. She started texting me first wanting to talk, so we would talk for like an hour or so, and I would get tired of having to respond, so I would tell her that I had to go study and that I would text her back later. Except I never did. So she would text me back a few days later, and I would do the same thing again. This happened like three or four more times before she just stopped texting to me all together. Then, she showed up somewhere she knew I would be, I said hey real quick and went back to talking to someone else, and she texted me like a month later mad at me asking if we were still friends. The point is, please dont blow her off if she happens to text you first. I hoped this helped, let me know if you have any other questions I can try to help you with."

TL;DR: No one is interested in me. Im so unattractive that I run most girls off, and if that doesnt make them leave then my personality does. 


Girls just arent interested in me. Up until I was around 10, I was perfectly normal (had friends, girls liked me, I had normal interests). Then, a few people started making fun of me and bullying me. A couple of years later, I developed depression, anxiety, and social awkwardness, which just made more and more people make fun of me. I met a girl when I was 13 and we started dating (we couldnt really go out on dates at that age with strict parents). We became best friends, but then she cheated on me with one of the main guys who bullied and made fun of me. We still talked and were best friends until she died when I was 17. A few weeks before she died, she told me that she liked me at first, but once she got to know me better, she didnt like me in a romantic way, and that she had felt guilty for years because she knew I still loved her but she didnt have the same feelings. She was going to have pity sex with me since I had never kissed a girl, saw boobs in real life, or had sex. Of course, she died before that happened, so I still havent kissed a girls, saw boobs in real life, or had sex.

While all of that was happening, more and more people started making fun of me and bullying me. Even teachers joined in (they would even go out of their way to give me the lowest grade they possibly could - example would be a 90 completion grade on something that I fully completed). I was like the outcast of my class (there were only 17 of us - small school). I wasnt invited to anything, the only people who would talk to me were people who were looking for something new to make fun of me about, and I wanted to leave there so bad but my parents wouldnt let me transfer. 

Once I graduated high school, I hoped that everything would change, but of course some of the people that I went to high school with also went to the same college as me (and had a few classes with me). I met a few girls there, but all of the people I went to high school with would go out of their way to meet them too so that they could tell them everything they made fun of me for and make fun of me in front of them. The few that I was able to meet without them knowing just used me or stopped talking to me once they got to know me a little. After I graduated from there, I moved on to a 4 year university, and I havent met anyone there. I dont live on campus so I cant really go to any events outside of class. I just feel like an outcast there. I helped two girls on a project a few weeks ago (even though I knew they were just using me for that), so it was nice to get to talk to someone, but neither of them were interested in being friends and they were both in relationships, so nothing happened there. 

Ive tried various things to try to improve my personality and looks, but nothing has worked. I started working out (which allowed me to gain 40 pounds of mostly muscle - I dont work out as much now since I dont have time, so I would classify myself as slightly skinny fat), stopped masterbating for 3 months (started back after I realized nothing had changed), stopped playing video games (did nothing but make me bored at night), growing a decent beard (I look better with it than without), and taking care of myself in terms of hygiene (cologne, trimming my beard, skin care, better haircut). 

The only place I feel halfway accepted is in on Reddit in subreddits like this and r/MGTOW (even though I identify more as an Incel Without Hate since Im not single by choice). I just wish I was normal or at least knew what to do to make everything better or had actual friends to talk to/hang out with."

This is the program that I was on for my first year. 6 days a week may seem a little intimidating at first, but my body quickly got used to it. For others, it may be different, so try to listen to your body. As I became more experienced, I added a few things to the end of every workout to get more work in.

In terms of what to say, it really depends on the situation. Of course, youll have a reason to start talking, but beyond that, I only have a few situational examples. 

If you go to school together, talk about how many more years they have until they graduate (also a good way to figure out age); if theyve went there all 4 years or transferred; what their major is and if they like it; if they live on campus and if they like it; if theyre going to graduate school after they finish their undergraduate. 

If you meet them at the gym, talk about what workout theyre doing; how long theyve been working out; ask for tips; ask what supplements they do. 

If you meet them at a sports bar, talk about what their favorite sports are; what teams they like; when they started watching sports; if they played any sports in school; who their favorite players are; if theyve ever been to any games."

Thank you for sharing this. It actually helped me do a little bit of self reflection. Im heading into my final semester of college in a couple of days (the anxiety and stress already started a few days ago), and I tend to feel like I dont have time for anything like walks (for me, I found weight lifting helps a lot), getting 8 hours of sleep, or cooking myself a full meal. Ive tried to have perfect grades all 4 years (and succeeded for the most part), but I hate that Im the way that I am.

socialanxiety,fembqi9,t3_epvdn9,1579247566.0,"That’s how most girls do. If you’re worried about texting too much, try to pay attention to how she’s responding. If she’s only giving one word responses, like “yeah,” “cool,” “okay,” or something to that effect, she’s not interested in what you’re talking about or doesn’t want to text as much. Another strategy you can take is not texting her until you know you’ll have to stop texting for something. For example, start texting her at 1:30 if you have a class at 3:00. When class is about to start, say something like “my class is about to start, I’ll text you back later!” You can do the same thing when you need to study or go to bed too. Just make sure not to do it too much. 

If there’s a bright side to it, it’s that it makes it really special when she texts first. But whatever you do, please please please do not use an excuse to stop texting her if she texts you first. I made a similar mistake that I’ll share to try to help you: I hadn’t talked to or seen this girl who was my best friend in like a month and a half. She started texting me first wanting to talk, so we would talk for like an hour or so, and I would get tired of having to respond, so I would tell her that I had to go study and that I would text her back later. Except I never did. So she would text me back a few days later, and I would do the same thing again. This happened like three or four more times before she just stopped texting to me all together. Then, she showed up somewhere she knew I would be, I said hey real quick and went back to talking to someone else, and she texted me like a month later mad at me asking if we were still friends. The point is, please don’t blow her off if she happens to text you first. I hoped this helped, let me know if you have any other questions I can try to help you with."

TL;DR: No one is interested in me. I’m so unattractive that I run most girls off, and if that doesn’t make them leave then my personality does. 


Girls just aren’t interested in me. Up until I was around 10, I was perfectly normal (had friends, girls “liked” me, I had normal interests). Then, a few people started making fun of me and bullying me. A couple of years later, I developed depression, anxiety, and social awkwardness, which just made more and more people make fun of me. I met a girl when I was 13 and we started “dating” (we couldn’t really go out on dates at that age with strict parents). We became best friends, but then she cheated on me with one of the main guys who bullied and made fun of me. We still talked and were best friends until she died when I was 17. A few weeks before she died, she told me that she liked me at first, but once she got to know me better, she didn’t like me in a romantic way, and that she had felt guilty for years because she knew I still loved her but she didn’t have the same feelings. She was going to have pity sex with me since I had never kissed a girl, saw boobs in real life, or had sex. Of course, she died before that happened, so I still haven’t kissed a girls, saw boobs in real life, or had sex.

While all of that was happening, more and more people started making fun of me and bullying me. Even teachers joined in (they would even go out of their way to give me the lowest grade they possibly could - example would be a 90 completion grade on something that I fully completed). I was like the outcast of my class (there were only 17 of us - small school). I wasn’t invited to anything, the only people who would talk to me were people who were looking for something new to make fun of me about, and I wanted to leave there so bad but my parents wouldn’t let me transfer. 

Once I graduated high school, I hoped that everything would change, but of course some of the people that I went to high school with also went to the same college as me (and had a few classes with me). I met a few girls there, but all of the people I went to high school with would go out of their way to meet them too so that they could tell them everything they made fun of me for and make fun of me in front of them. The few that I was able to meet without them knowing just used me or stopped talking to me once they got to know me a little. After I graduated from there, I moved on to a 4 year university, and I haven’t met anyone there. I don’t live on campus so I can’t really go to any events outside of class. I just feel like an outcast there. I helped two girls on a project a few weeks ago (even though I knew they were just using me for that), so it was nice to get to talk to someone, but neither of them were interested in being friends and they were both in relationships, so nothing happened there. 

I’ve tried various things to try to improve my personality and looks, but nothing has worked. I started working out (which allowed me to gain 40 pounds of mostly muscle - I don’t work out as much now since I don’t have time, so I would classify myself as slightly skinny fat), stopped masterbating for 3 months (started back after I realized nothing had changed), stopped playing video games (did nothing but make me bored at night), growing a decent beard (I look better with it than without), and taking care of myself in terms of hygiene (cologne, trimming my beard, skin care, better haircut). 

The only place I feel halfway accepted is in on Reddit in subreddits like this and r/MGTOW (even though I identify more as an Incel Without Hate since I’m not single by choice). I just wish I was normal or at least knew what to do to make everything better or had actual friends to talk to/hang out with."

This is the program that I was on for my first year. 6 days a week may seem a little intimidating at first, but my body quickly got used to it. For others, it may be different, so try to listen to your body. As I became more experienced, I added a few things to the end of every workout to get more work in. In addition to this, I would recommend getting some whey protein powder and drinking it after every workout. Try to eat a high protein diet and avoid junk food and you should be feeling and looking better in no time."

If it’s in a group, I’m scared to say anything because I’ll be judged. But the only problem is we never “become” friends. They seem interested and everything, but they never talk to me or acknowledge me again. Hopefully it’ll work better for you. 

In terms of what to say, it really depends on the situation. Of course, you’ll have a reason to start talking, but beyond that, I only have a few situational examples. 

If you go to school together, talk about how many more years they have until they graduate (also a good way to figure out age); if they’ve went there all 4 years or transferred; what their major is and if they like it; if they live on campus and if they like it; if they’re going to graduate school after they finish their undergraduate. 

If you meet them at the gym, talk about what workout they’re doing; how long they’ve been working out; ask for tips; ask what supplements they do. 

If you meet them at a sports bar, talk about what their favorite sports are; what teams they like; when they started watching sports; if they played any sports in school; who their favorite players are; if they’ve ever been to any games."

I’m really glad that you’re getting help with everything that you went through. 

Thank you for sharing this. It actually helped me do a little bit of self reflection. I’m heading into my final semester of college in a couple of days (the anxiety and stress already started a few days ago), and I tend to feel like I don’t have time for anything like walks (for me, I found weight lifting helps a lot), getting 8 hours of sleep, or cooking myself a full meal. I’ve tried to have perfect grades all 4 years (and succeeded for the most part), but I hate that I’m the way that I am. I’ve let up a little bit for the past year, but your experience showed me how detrimental that can be to people around me, so I’m going to strive to not be so focused on stuff like that this semester. 

Like I said before, feel free to message me anytime if you need to talk, vent, or anything else."

It probably sounds generic, but did you ever try working out with him or helping him get on a good sleep schedule (which can be hard with university) or help him eat some healthier foods? I wouldn’t specifically point out to him that you wanted to do these things in the name of helping him with his depression, but I know that those things help a lot with it. 

Honestly, he was very lucky to have someone like you and like I said before, you did everything you could. Feel free to message me or respond to this if you ever need to talk about it some more"

As a side-note, I hadn’t been enjoying video games for a few years now. I would tell myself that after I finished my backlog, I would stop playing, but I would just end up buying a few games I was interested in on Black Friday. I enjoyed madden a little bit, but I realized it’s really toxic with everyone online running cheese plays and spending absurd amounts of money on their teams.

When I got to college, I decided to focus on my grades, and even though I’ve succeeded in that regard, I’m a failure in every other way.
