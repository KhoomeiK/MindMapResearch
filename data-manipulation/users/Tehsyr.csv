DnD,fek2mas,t1_fejy3mi,1579191291.0,"It is, but with backstories I try to vary how tragic it can be while balancing out the good as well. With this concept, its an idea for the DM to take and run with it. Who were they in their past life, what were their connections, how long were they ""dead"" before being brought back to life, who made the warforged body and who brought them back, and why was their new body left in the forest. The only input I'd have to contribute to the DM is that when a soul is put back in their original body, its easy since the soul already has all the connections there (revivify, reincarnation, raise dead, etc.) When a soul is put into a different body, it doesn't have those connections, and the only easy way to do so is by wiping most of the memories. Or at the very least block them."

With the head, they look human, and to anyone who isn't too keen, they'll believe they are human who just wears heavy armor all the time. In their past life, they were indeed human. Then they woke up in a clearing in a forest, now a warforged, knowing they died, but can't remember anything else before that. Hence Goodbye To A World."

From that session on, my Barbarian eventually became the one who would disengage from an enemy to rush to a fallen ally and whisk them away from harm. Eventually it came to a point where the DM gave him the feat Fearless Rescue: When a PC falls unconscious in your line of sight, you can use your reaction to dash to their side and expend a barbarian hit die to heal them. For each opportunity attack you incur, they heal an extra d6.

That campaign is over (fell apart actually, DM didn't feel like running it anymore), but the concept of my barbarian always rushing to someone's side to rescue them/carry them from danger is something I've kept with each iteration/improvement for him."

AskReddit,fdmqedx,t1_fdmji0m,1578560639.0,"There's one possible reason for this, since this happened with me too. Locking a bathroom door? Maybe it had an old doorknob where there was no keyhole on the outside, but a button lock on the inside, where you accidentally lock the bathroom with no one inside. Not closing your bedroom door? It's possible they lived in a railroad style home, meaning all the rooms are in a straight line. If your bedroom door is closed, that path going across the home/apartment is blocked."

worldnews,fdm4oeu,t1_fdm0f7b,1578539713.0,"And therein lies humanity's problem. Everyone is so inundated with things that will take up all their time that there isn't much time to give a shit to make change. Having a family is stressful enough, working a job and making sure you earn enough money is stressful enough, only the ones in power have time to give a shit, and they don't either because it's profitable to them."
Military,fdm2l53,t1_fdln1f3,1578538305.0,"Because they're the /r/army subreddit. Not /r/military. For the amount of memes that get posted here, we try to cull the amount to something more reasonable, but it's still too much."

DestinyTheGame,fdlrgfh,t1_fdhkhh9,1578530734.0,"It's just like when they were back with Microsoft. Under microsoft the game finally got made, since Bungie is too ambitious and wants to incorporate really big ideas into a game. They needed someone to keep them on track and set hard deadlines with consequences. Sure we got a duct taped and two part epoxied Destiny 1, but it was made, funded, and did well enough on its own. Same with D2, Activision kept them on track, set deadlines and consequences. Now with themselves at the helm, bungie is taking this game into any direction they feel like it, implementing player feedback that is the easiest to do while sidestepping the harder ideas."
