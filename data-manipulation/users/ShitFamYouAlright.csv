Right now I’m wearing a lot of turtlenecks tucked into high waisted black jeans or oversized flannel over neutral shirts with faded blue jeans. Basically just trying to stay warm."

TrueAskReddit,feieirb,t3_epbfw2,1579136654.0,"I felt similarly in high school, so I searched up tricks to feeling happier and I found one that really helped me. Think of at least one thing that happened everyday that made you feel happy or at least felt somewhat positive. It doesn’t matter how small it is, maybe you waved hi to a friend that day or learned something new or even just ate something good. Just focus on that one good thing. It sounds kinda stupid but it helped me shift my focus from all the negative to the positive."

LGBTeens,feedh09,t3_eomsn3,1579031494.0,"I’m sorry dude this must really suck for you, but you have to see that while your mum might be somewhat homophobic, I think she called him a pervert because you’re a minor and he’s a full grown ass adult. Him blocking you on everything gives further evidence that he knew what he was doing was wrong and doesn’t want anyone to know about it."
Stuyvesant,fedff0c,t3_eoet82,1579010043.0,"Please meet with your guidance counselor, they are meant to help with problems just like this. They can help change up your schedule or talk with your teachers to give you a little slack. If you really are scared to talk to your own guidance counselor (I know they aren’t all the best), then talk to Ms. Uy (if you don’t already have her) she was my guidance counselor and was immensely helpful throughout my entire high school experience. Good luck!"
chanceme,fdeqvvb,t3_ekvsug,1578344726.0,"Stuyvesant grad here, it’s gonna be super tough to get into ivies with those stats since everyone at stuy has similar ones. Your GPA is slightly above average for stuy, but SAT is just about the average for stuy. Also, your ECs don’t really have a common theme or align with your major at all. I think you should look at other schools and put ivies as your reaches."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fd26otp,t1_fd1oeat,1578142532.0,can you give an example of a character whose personality is just “gay” and is simply pandering?

unpopularopinion,fcygz5q,t1_fcxln57,1578079953.0,"my guy, why do you think the word ‘gay’ started to have a negative connotation? maybe because it was related to homosexuality?"
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcy1zk8,t1_fcxv9a9,1578073672.0,Exactly! We shouldn’t have to. Pandering doesn’t mean anything when said pandering is just including actual people who exist!!

college,fcxssc3,t3_ejeuio,1578069987.0,"I thought for sure I was gonna get into Cornell (I realize now this was pretty naive), and was devastated when I was not only rejected from there, but every other private school I applied too. I ended up going to Binghamton University, my states top public school, and I thought I was gonna be miserable. Turns out I met some really interesting people there, I’ve taken some amazing courses, and now I’m realizing how fucking expensive Cornell would’ve been.  Thinking in the long run has really changed my mindset."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcxq2ye,t1_fcxp71f,1578068782.0,okay then what in your opinion would be a good justification for having gay people in a movie??
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcxos2j,t1_fcxj1l4,1578067966.0,"What’s so fucking bad about being inclusive?? Yeah it might be a little pandering, but it’s better than having no lgbt characters at all"
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcxom40,t1_fcx3nyi,1578067860.0,"ok so we should solve the problem by normalizing the existence of gay characters in media, which is done by adding more gay characters, pandering or not."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcxoeml,t1_fcx3p0h,1578067727.0,"It didn’t add to the story, but it didn’t take away from it either. Why not have dumbledore be gay?"
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcwzyfm,t3_ej8alm,1578045007.0,"Well yeah, I don’t think anyone was arguing otherwise."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcwzxhq,t1_fcwsucu,1578044974.0,"Yes but that itself is representation. The lgbtq just wants to see themselves in media sometimes, and if the characters are just pandering, then we take what we can get. We get so few gay and practically no trans characters in media that we just accept it."
BarbaraWalters4Scale,fcwzowb,t1_fcwz8n8,1578044663.0,Sorry it all looks like one link on mobile. But the axios article does suggest it : “We don't have 12 years to prevent climate change — we have no time.  It's already here.”
BarbaraWalters4Scale,fcwyiy6,t1_fcwt4hn,1578043135.0,"huh, the article actually suggests that it’s too late and there isn’t anything we can do to reverse climate and that 12 years is too long of a period. Basically, we’re fucked."

AskReddit,fcmnuo0,t3_ehu40p,1577783452.0,"Back in middle school I knew a girl named Wisdom. At the time I actually thought her name was pretty cool (I have a pretty plain name), but she always said that she hated it and her parents. Later I found out that her last name was Vision. Her full name was Wisdom Vision. My little brother was friends with her brother, Messiah.

Wisdom and Messiah Vision

I don't blame her for hating her parents."
actuallesbians,fbin70p,t3_edag1y,1576906349.0,"I started talking with this girl on tinder and she seemed receptive at first, but then just wouldn't continue the conversation. So I just stopped replying. Then she messages me a ""Hey!"" a few days later and we start talking again but she still won't put any effort into the conversation. I wanted to just straight up ask her ""Are you just not interested anymore or do you not know how to text??"", Idk it really frustrated me."
