Can you give any examples of a simulation in which we credibly believe that the things being stimulated are sentient? (Or, if you like, at least as sentient as we are?)

We don't have anything close to it. And it seems to me quite a jump from ""we don't have anything close to it"" to ""it's happened an infinite number of times."""
TrueAskReddit,fdwwh64,t3_en7tpo,1578762974.0,"There are a few bot detectors out there. You could pop your account into one and see what it says.

But frankly I think you may be facing an uphill battle. A bot is technically automated, but the person may be using it to mean more generally, ""not a real account, the kind of account you only use to do things like entering sweepstakes."" After all, giveaways are marketing tools: you get people to mention you, thus advertising your account to their friends, in exchange for a chance at the prize. It sounds like you've intentionally circumvented that by creating an account with non of your friends, and the prize-giver is right to be upset.

Did the giveaway have rules that you (or the host) can point to? How are they defining bot?"

Oh no, you're again asserting things that we can't possibly know.

You're taking it as a leap of faith that I can't prove things using circular reasoning. In fact, we can't even know if circular reasoning is a real thing.

Do you see where I'm going with this? Besides being a bit snarky, I'm also pointing out that if you want to care about ""what is reality, anyway?"" then you have to preface every. little. thing. you. say. with that caveat. It gets pretty annoying pretty fast, right?

Or you can just confine that discussion to the branches of philosophy that are concerned with it, and in everything else, just recognize that everything in the discussion is caveated with and predicated on that understanding of reality and the questions of objective knowledge.

askscience,fdeqoex,t1_fdeojn6,1578344601.0,"Whether you ""believe in"" an axiom is a matter of faith. What you do with it *once you assume it's true* is not, though -- and that's what math is primarily concerned about.

In other words, it's not ""we assume that X is true, and given that, we believe Y."" You're right that that would be a statement of faith. Instead, it's ""*if* we assume that X is true, then Y must also be true.""

Whether to include a new axiom in a budding field is a non-objective decision (call it faith, politics, pragmatics, whatever), which ultimately boils down to ""do we think that this seems kinda reasonable, and will it be useful?"" Often, when you propose one, the math establishment balks at first, but if you can provide a good reason to accept it, then you can sway minds (the Axiom of Choice is a good example).

But even if the larger math community doesn't accept it, you can still accept it within your own work, where it will still be prefixed by ""*if* we assume my new axiom, then..."" -- and the rest of your work will not be a work of faith. It'll just be using a slightly different branch of math than most of the world does, which means you may have trouble getting people to care about your theorems. :-)"
askscience,fdeksun,t1_fdeia5i,1578341138.0,"Exactly. Or to put it another way: if you're not ready to formalize ""it's obvious"" into an axiom and follow its implications, then you're making an assertion about math using language that's outside of math -- which math is, by definition, not in a position to either refute or agree with. Sounds to me like a word game."
