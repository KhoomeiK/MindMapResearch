fragrance,fffmg2g,t3_etbezn,1579887117.0,"Patchouli smells like when it's been really, really dry outside and then there is a rainstorm. The dusty roads smell muddy and sweet suddenly and the grass smells wet and fresh. 

It's green and earthy, a bit tobacco-y, a bit woody."
aww,ffflurd,t3_et89cu,1579886756.0,His snoot-eye coordination is fantastic!
fragrance,fff5uu3,t1_ffeix7w,1579876483.0,I like this but for some reason this always reminds me of a sophisticated version of the Garnier Fuctus Shampoo line.
fragrance,fff5q97,t1_ffe6bn9,1579876388.0,"I like Pink Sugar but have never worn it myself. I get a nice liquorice note on the dry down. Makes me think of a flaming sambuca shot, topped with cotton candy and the glass rimmed with sugar."
fragrance,fff3sam,t3_et3hbb,1579874934.0,"I am probably going to get tarred and feathered here but, Jennifer Lopez Miami Glow EDT smells like Passion Fruit, Pineapple and Coconut Water. Dries down to a clean musk. 

It smells like a piña colada or like a fancy and fruity umbrella drink at an all inclusive resort."
fragrance,fff2pgi,t1_ffdyo24,1579874090.0,"I blind bought Fresh Sugar Lychee (EDP) at Sephora 4 years ago and I was majorly disappointed. 

I neither loved or hated it but to me it was all citrus (lemon with hints of grapefruit) browned sugar (caramel-y) and lemon blossom but no lychee at all. When wearing it I felt like a big lemon wedge or a tall glass of lemonade. 

I ended up using it to spritz my bedsheets while ironing them and used it up that way."
dogs,fff1hdx,t1_ffeyofv,1579873098.0,"Just don't start using the crate as punishment because the puppy will associate the crate with ""bad-bad no-no time"" and might not want to use the crate, even at night. Reward puppy for going into the crate with high value treat. In fact, separating both of them for a cool down period is a good idea."
DoggyDNA,ffc8qtf,t3_esnyqo,1579794117.0,What a goober! I bet you have some hilarious stories featuring Remy!
ADHD,ffb6syr,t3_eskndz,1579753337.0,Yes! Especially when I haven't slept well the night before too!
