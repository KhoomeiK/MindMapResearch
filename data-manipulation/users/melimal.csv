todayilearned,fgfa7ku,t1_fgevxdh,1580732031.0,"I recall being taught this too, though I thought it wasn't all genes on the X chromosome, only the genes that are on the 4th lobe of the X chromosome that aren't on the Y chromosome.  

I think I remember it this way because I was taught that color blindness (recessive expressed) occurs more in males because it's a gene on the lobe of the X chromosome that is missing on the Y chromosome. But females can have color blindness if that gene is mutated on both copies of the X chromosome. And the odds of a female having two mutations of the gene are much smaller than the male scenario of having one mutated gene on the X and no matching gene on the Y."

news,ffelw8p,t1_ffe6agh,1579853654.0,"We do this at our home. One recent fall we started putting cameras on the couple traps we have so we don't have to climb/crawl into the attic/crawlspace to find nothing. The reason we were finding nothing that fall? The mice weren't going into the tunnel to get to the food and get trapped along the way, they were trying to chew their way in to the food section from the outside. We gave them a couple more days, but nothing changed. So with a heavy heart we got snap traps."
TwoXChromosomes,ff5bi65,t1_ff4fxqc,1579586225.0,">If you want to breastfeed a kid this has to be the mother for like 6 months anyways. 

You'd think, but in America, we breastfeeding, working moms get the joy of hooking ourselves up to pumping machines that are at least covered by insurance, if mom or mom's spouse gets insurance benefits through their job. Isn't that something? The one time American health insurance comes through for us, it's so moms can get back to work after 6 weeks of paid short term disability (and those 6 weeks are only if mom gets insurance benefits through her job, otherwise it's unpaid leave until mom can pull it together to return to work). Of course, we say 6 weeks paid leave, but typically the first week costs mom 5 days of her own vacation time. Then 5 weeks paid disability leave."

And those with 2 incomes may still be living paycheck to paycheck because minimum wage x2 barely covers a couple's living costs, and throwing in a child means money has to stretch further than it can, but it has to somehow.  The ""reality"" you describe is the American dream that for many, remains a dream, not a reality."

news,fehgp4n,t1_fegpowq,1579116171.0,"I'm definitely paying my $$$$ in taxes for years, and we'll eventually have a kid in school, but not for a few years. My state has a huge pension deficit thanks to people in my mom's generation who promised public employees massive retirement pensions. Those employees retired, are living longer, more people are being added to the retirement pool and it's going belly up. There's been a large number of people leaving the state because taxes go up, and as someone who has stayed because of opportunity and other family here, I'm stuck paying the taxes for my teachers' (and all the other public employees') pensions. Meanwhile, it was cheaper for her to pay taxes to her state on her pension from here (she wasn't a teacher, but another public employee) than to continue paying the taxes here. I'm sure droves of other public retirees have done the same, and so they're not putting money back into the state."

I agree though, how many generations are suffering in some way because a small portion of people have a vast majority of the wealth?"
