Not only does SHE not know that she needs to put clean clothes on (bare minimum clean socks & underwear) but STAFF (frustratingly) don't really check up or enforce that this is part of the routine & I have found her (to my utter horror) in the same socks and underwear for a full week.

Sadly, if the father cannot be that supportive, encouraging tangible comfort, then he needs to seek help, OUTSIDE of the L&D room. Under NO circumstances should FIL be permitted in that room & I'd be hesitant, given his behaviour, to allow him contact at all at present. I feel badly for the OP's husband, as he has CLEARLY  undergone trauma & years of skewed mental framing regarding his own mother's death, but these understandable embers of fear are having gasoline thrown on them by FIL. OP, Love, I'm so sorry for the stress this has caused you. Please go with your husband to his therapy appointment & make sure the therapist is aware of the gravity of the situation, speak to your OB to make it 100% clear that your FIL & (without change) your Husband cannot be in the room with you during the birth, & make sure that in the lead up to this important event, you are tending to YOUR needs, not THEIR fears. If this means finding someplace else to stay, then it might come down to that. I would also speak to your OB about POA, because I wouldn't want someone with that mindset being the person who would be left to make decisions about my health should any complications arise. You want someone who will respect your needs & wants & if all they can do is fixate on death, that will likely prevent them from doing so.

AmItheAsshole,ffr3zow,t1_ffquqtn,1580149958.0,"Unresolved grief is, in itself, incidious in the way that it pries open any cracks in the relationship foundation & makes everything even more unstable. Not in ANY way supportive of Mom disowning her child for leaving the church or for her behaviour since that point, but grief can make people act ugly (or uglier, as the case may be). Having said that, ultimately, you can't change other people, you need to continue to live your life in a manner that allows you to both feel fulfilled & supported & I'm SO glad that you're going to counseling. Do your best to not say or do anything that you may regret later, but be kind to yourself & cognizant of your needs as you try & heal from a life changing loss. Time & perspective help, so does finding ways to give back to others in your Lost Loved One's name, so that some good can come out of tragedy. YOU are not at fault, people who put that fault at your feet lack insight into the reality of the situation, their own role in the preceding fracture. Sadly, some people become bitter & hateful during the grief process, become ""stuck"" & are unable to work through it  Continue getting as much help as you can, build the supportive relationships with willing family & friends & let time & distance reveal what course Mom's side of the family will take. Sending condolences about your Dad, OP; personally, I know how monumental a loss this can be & my heart goes out to you. I hope you're  able to try to aim to accept, without guilt, the gift that it he was wanting to be reunited with you, with love at the forefront. Xo"

The wise redditor above has hit the nail on the head: YOU are SO much more than just shared genetic material & his actions do not, in ANY way, predict or mould your future path, because you have free will. 100% - please seek counseling to help you deal with the fallout, so that a certified professional can guide you through the process, in a healthy fashion. To change the perspective for a moment, regarding your Mom: yes, the rape was likely one of the most distressing things she has undergone BUT out of such darkness came the incredible blessing that is YOU. Your father IS the man who has loved & raised you. Biologically, your mother's rapist may have contributed to some of your genetics, but the time, love, influence & support from those people who are your soft place to fall - with the exception of yourself, THOSE are the people who have the impact on how you turn out.

After multiple days of use, as one sweats, the environment can become a breeding ground for bacteria & yeast. In addition, the integrity of one's skin can be compromised & if it breaks down, then bacteria can enter the body that way as well, & sores & infection can arise. All in all, be diligent with your hygiene, change your underclothing regularly & as needed,  & no one will have to write in to a social media site about your manky minge. Problem solved! Best of luck, OP. Practically, I think your only way forward is to (a) speak to her,  critically assess her mental health & if you think that's a concern, at all, see about marshalling some resources to help her access support (b) talk to her, kindly & honestly about your scent sensitivity, & maybe ask her if there's a reason she's not doing what seems to be a fundamental daily part of Adulting, & if no, ask if she'd be willing to do so more regularly.

The Mom, Kathleen, died after suffering an unexpected intercranial bleed, but not before donating her organs to 12 people. Before SHE gave birth, she was encouraging an acquaintance who having given birth recently, was going through mastitis & was burdened with an overactive supply. She prayed for & supported this other woman, who is graciously gifting the Thorson Family her milk so that their newborn son can benefit from it. This woman is an unsung hero to parents & wee ones alike, who for a wide variety of reasons, cannot provide their children with this kind of nutritional option. Absolute respect.

dementia,ff890ro,t1_ff87d2z,1579669543.0,"Not to add to your worry, but one of the reasons it IS so hard to know is that the umbrella diagnosis of dementia (which are the symptoms prevalent that you hear about when people talk about cognitive impairment diseases like Alzheimer's, Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia etc) can manifest  differently in different people. Importantly (as previously posted) there are a HOST of things that can cause these symptoms & that's why I would 100% push to speak with her doctor NOW. Talk to your sibs. You *know* your Mom, & you are better equipped than her doctor to know when she's not acting in a way that she previously did. Keep notes of incidents, behaviours & dates (not in an obvious way that Mom should be aware of) so that you can better explain your concern. It's a process of elimination, whereby they would likely give her a test, & rule out infection, thyroid issues etc first to delve to the root of the problem. Try not to panic, but also, listen to your gut. It's your Mom's health, either way, & you're a good son to care so much about her well being.

dementia,ff87kyc,t3_es0un7,1579668276.0,"I'm coming from a slightly different perspective, (it is my Mom that's sick) but what I CAN tell you is that this, sadly, doesnt get better & that your instincts are correct, this situation is 100% an emergency waiting to happen. My Mom is currently in the hospital, diagnosed with Alzheimer's after my husband & I waited 40+ hrs in a waiting room with her, to get her seen (on her 70th birthday) for a massive decline in cognition & a nasty wound on her leg that she could give no details on how or when it happened. This was after we moved her closer to us after my Dad died & after a full year & a half of  DH & I trying to raise the alarm that SOMETHING  was wrong. My only sibling lives just over an hour away & while Mom couldn't see what was happening (lack of insight is a hallmark reality), my sib didn't want to see it. We had  taken over more & more of her responsibilities (from finances to shopping to laundry etc) & along the way, set up a Meal Program to look in on her midday as there is no extended family & only my spouse & I about 30 mins away. When I found the wound, after she suddenly forgot how to bathe or dress herself & was panicked all the time about everything, I was worried about the decline being related to infection. Something as simple as a UTI can push these patients over the proverbial edge & we forced the issue. Since then, she's been deemed incapable of making decisions in her best interest & because she didn't prepare with a Will or POA (again, despite numerous talks, no insight equaled no rush), we are now having to not only do ALL of the practical things (visiting, her laundry, bathing her as she still doesn't trust staff, touring both transitional full care homes AND Long Term Care Facilities as there's a waiting list for the latter, packing up all of her things, moving her out of her home etc) but ALSO having to jump through copious amounts of legal hoops & will end up in court JUST to continue to take care of her physically & financially. I tell you this because while I TOTALLY get that you & DH are not planning to move closer to them, & that FIL doesnt have insight & MIL is DEEP in denial, I want to  scream at you from the rooftops to push to get help in NOW. Arrange to talk to FILs doctor with MIL there & lay out the brutal reality of the situation. Hide nothing, spare no detail. This could turn from a difficult situation to an crisis overnight & believe me, it's hard enough dealing with grieving in slow motion for a parent. The last thing your family needs is to be dealing with the soul crushing tasks of having to dance the tango with the legal system & learn how to navigate the broken healthcare system DURING the crisis. MIL needs a wake up call. FIL needs more help than she will be able to give on her own & both of their safety has to be put paramount above their pride. Yes, of course, all of this has to be done with love, but if YOU (DH & you) are going to be saddled with The Fallout, things need to be in place now. First & foremost, SAFETY.  Is MIL safe NOW to care for FILs needs? What care support can he brought into the home & what can they afford? Have you talked with them about why staying in this home is so important? Is it fear of the unknown, is it finances, is it that she loves her garden ,& doesnt want to leave it? If you lovingly can understand the WHY, you might he better able to lovingjy help her see the good in alternative solutions (I.e. Assisted Living Retirement Home ABC has a gorgeous garden, plenty of social opportunities, is within your budget AND will have help for FIL when he needs it so that you, MIL can go back to being his Wife rather than his Primary Caregiver). If it IS denial, have a PCP or FILs Geriatrician explain the severity & what can go wrong, & you & DH are going to have to be honest, as the above wise soul already stated, about what you CAN & are WILLING  to take on, to help her make more realistic decisions. To that end, get Wills & POAs sorted out yesterday. Just get them done. We should all have them & this experience has opened my eyes in the most painful way. For the sake of your sanity (& hubby's) consider joining a support group. Reddit is wonderful & there are IRL peer groups that can provide a safe place for you to vent, ask questions & learn from others.  Educate yourselves on the best way to connect & interact as it can make a world of difference to how you all manage the relationship & the time you guys have left. My heart breaks for all of you because nothing about this is easy, but knowing really IS half the battle (childhood GI Joe reference...sorry) & by being as prepared as you can be, you will lessen the amount of GAHH you will have to deal with WHEN  he declines. Looking back, I would have forced the issue harder, much sooner. I was trying to be respectful & accommodating to my Mom's preference as a private person, but bottom line, my Mom is not the same person that she was before this disease took hold & the kindest thing I can do for her now is, whilst doing my utmost to love her & lovingly respect her wishes WHERE they can be respected, is to make she's safe. From there, I can work to give her the best quality of life she can possibly have. Safety first. You don't want you, your DH or your MIL to have to live with the regret of NOT protecting someone who is no longer capable of protecting themselves. And if MILs denial, as understandable as it is, is going to endanger herself AND FIL, then as a loving & caring DIL (who HAS the objectivity, & insight to see around the corners that they are unable/unwilling to), I would strongly advise that you start working towards helping the family get their literal &  figurative houses in order. Sorry about the length, but you are basically me, last November. The day before my Mom had to be hospitalized, I said to my DH that I felt like we were on the edge of a precipice, or watching a train coming flying towards our loved one,  whilst loved ones stood oblivious on the tracks. My world has imploded. I have had to take off of work as this has become a literal full-time job. And it's nowhere NEAR settled yet. I wish I had had someone sit me down & kindly but firmly say that if your heart is in the right place, listen to your gut, get AS MUCH help as you can BEFORE you think you actually need it (because they probably need the help already & nothing happens instantaneously), be kind to yourself because this takes a huge toll on a family & make time for you & DH becsuse this is a particularly difficult way to lose a loved one & you will need one another. This community is always here to help & I'm sending strength & support across the interwebs. Best of luck & please,if you like,  keep us in the loop & know that we're here,  cheering you on. Xo"

The decline was more gradual initially, & she was in worse shape than your Mom prior to bring hospitalized back at the start of December, but she had a sudden & marked decline whereby she couldn't remember how to bathe, what the toilet was for, what a bodily function even was & this occurred within a span of a few days. I  also found a wound on her thigh when I was finally able to convince her to let me bathe her, & I was really concerned that it, & possibly a UTI were to blame. She DID have a mild UTI, and after a 1.5 months of care, monitoring & routine, she is marginally better than she was when she was first admitted but the physicians do not believe she will ever reclaim what she lost. They said sometimes the ""haze"" as it were, lifts a little but sadly, they often see an infection set off a storm that can't be quieted. My heart goes out to you, because I know how much I wish my Mom would gain back some of what she's lost, cognition wise, & hope is so vital, but if you aren't already getting support for yourself to deal with the journey ahead, I would really encourage it. I hope for the best outcome for your Mom. This community is here if you ever need to chat. Xo"

Or research if your family is able to handle (financially & responsibly wise) the addition of a dog into your family, so that there would be an external  REASON to get up & go for regular walks together? The food is a HUGE part of this; making a shift as a family that is sustainable is vital but if she's reluctant to exercise autonomously now, keep helping her find activities that MIGHT interest her (I loathe running but I LOVE cycling & skating, so obviously, I'm much more likely to do those things more regularly), AND look for external motivators until she can internalize the motivation  herself. Without knowing anything about her childhood & any struggles she underwent, I can testify that 15 is a DIFFICULT age to navigate & her self esteem has likely taken a  hit with her weight as kids can be ignorant bellends. Counseling might  give her a place to get out her emotions, if she is currently dealing with them, in part, by eating. Above all, model good, consistent behaviour, & make sure that your family is her safe place to fall - a healthy, supportive, no judgement zone. There's a crucial difference between loving her enough to make sure you give her the tools to get a handle on her health  now  & being a source of criticism & judgement. OP, I'm chuffed that you & your family care enough to want to help & that you have reached out  not just to Reddit, but also to medical professionals, to give your daughter the best chance to get on top of this issue now.

dementia,feiu9d7,t3_ep6890,1579147372.0,"A digital picture frame helped my Mom tremendously. Maybe photos of the beach & pictures of loved ones & happy memories? Music that he likes? Food that he enjoys? He is dying, he needs more care than grandma can give him & he needs to be where he's safe & cared for BUT you are absolutely correct that listening to him, loving him & treating him with respect are paramount. I will say that despite my nursing background & my comfort & ability to deal with the needs of clients, nothing has brought me to my knees like this disease. In fact, because it is my MOM, I was finding myself SO short on patience...but it was masking my abject fear at the time (she was still living alone, but not independently - we were dealing with her finances, groceries, laundry, cleaning etc - & EVERY time we went over, something worrying would happen & I would have the realization that even WITH all of the planning & work we were doing to take care of her, it wasn't ENOUGH). I was scared & it was coming across like impatience. I don't know Grandma, obviously, but  what I'm saying is that she's losing her life partner, slowly & painfully & dementia is like grieving in slow motion, so there may be a lot more to her reactions to Grandpa then meet the eye. If you can, chat with Palliative Care Staff to see what suggestions they have to help Grandpa on this leg of his Life Journey. I'm so very glad he has you in his life. Xo"
CatsInSinks,feitb6u,t1_feifjbg,1579146658.0,Came here to say this!
dementia,feispq6,t3_epanm7,1579146225.0,"First off, I'm so glad that your Grandfather has a family who cares so much about him. Secondly, Love, you are 100% correct; this is SO HARD! For a grown adult who is supposed to be well versed in the world of ""Adulting"", it's mindboggling difficult, so Of Course you're struggling. I'm sure your Mom is too. If you haven't already, perhaps when your Grandpa goes to your Uncle's, your immediate family can make a point of having a Family Council/Meeting, & each of you can talk about things that you're struggling with AND ideas to overcome the struggles. A support group for caregivers who are dealing with loved ones with dementia is, in my opinion, SUCH a great source of not only peer support, but also strategies to cope with common issues (bathing, smell, safety concerns, the ""Noble Lie"" {mentioned earlier as white lying as a means to decrease anxiety or negative behaviours in an effort to uphold the greater good for the patient}), as well as becoming familiar with resources in your community, & a sounding board for the journey that your family is on. Because you ARE all on a journey here. And it's a confusing one. You've likely been taught to always Tell The Truth, Listen To Your Elders etc. Now, your Grandfather, while still in need of your love & respect, must be dealt with from a different vantage point. His safety (and the safety of everyone else in his reach) is paramount & he can no longer be the person who can assess that. It's great news that he is no longer driving, so that's not a worry. In terms of the animals, to echo a previous poster, I would ask your parents about changing the locking mechanism to the door in question so that he cannot access it to let them out because you are wasting oxygen trying to explain to him why that isn't a good idea. He is, sadly, no longer capable of rationalizing through logic. So, thinking ahead & planning for ways to navigate AROUND the problem is a better strategy & although it IS more work at the outset, it will save time, energy & frustration trying to appeal to either his memory or his ability to reason through the concern. Same goes for when he gets anxious or upset about something you KNOW to not be a concern (ie/ registering for school). He is entrenched by the idea, you cannot reason him off of it, so by acknowledging HIS reality, then saying something to appease him in the moment (Mom arranged for this to be done tomorrow), followed immediately by a DISTRACTION, you can help him move on. When it comes to the smell, I'm not sure if he's incontinent or having accidents, but if that's contributing to the scent, bringing him to the toliet frequently, on a routine, may help. Same with not serving drinks to him after a certain time in the evening. If the smell is more of a B.O., smell, regularly bathing (with assistance if necessary) is vital (they may be able to GET in the shower, but are they actually BATHING? With soap?), making sure that there's a checklist for the person assisting him so that deodorant etc is applied, making sure that clean clothes are put on daily (and if an accident occurs), that bedsheets, favourite chairs are changed/clesned as needed. In between showers/baths, there ARE non-rinse wipes that can help freshen up the patient. If the smell persists, I would have Mom or a relative take him to the doctor, because a change in body odor CAN be indicative of certain underlying health concerns & Grandoa may not be able to recognize or express changes he's experiencing. I  KNOW how frustrating it is, truly, but as best you can, try not to become angry or upset & do your best to monitor your facial expressions. The calmer & more soothing you can be in the moment, the less anxious & upset their reactions likely will be. Getting angry (while totally human of you) will only exacerbate the situation, so kudos to you for reaching out when you are feeling frustrated, because it shows insight & maturity well beyond your age! I'm a legit Adult & this disease (my Mom has just officially been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, but has been exhibiting signs for at least a year & a half, with steady decline & my hubby & I taking care of all of her banking, groceries, laundry, cleaning etc, followed by a sudden & marked decline in her cognition & a mysterious wound on her leg that necessitated her being admitted to hospital, deemed incompetent & is now waiting for placement in a Long Term Care Memory Unit) has brought me to my knees. I have a nursing background, am educated & comfortable with being a care provider, & still, this has nearly broken my spirit. It is like grieving someone in slow motion. My Mom had us a bit later in life, & my Dad died in 2014, so age wise, I'm dealing with this first out of my friend group & it has been a comedy of errors but you learn as you go on. My advice is educate & inform yourself, look for a support group (there are great ones online & you might have a better chance of connecting with other teens who are going through similar experiences with loved ones that way), get medical professionals involved EARLY & OFTEN (patients don't get better, & as your Grandpa requires more assistance, it can get overwhelming quickly & the best way forward, for all of your family, is to be brutally honest with the reality of the situation & your collective ability to ""handle"" it), & remember that this is taking a BIG toll on each of you, albeit in different ways, so it's equally important that you help your Mom out by giving her a chance to have some ""time to just breathe"" AND that you get a chance to be the teen you are (studying, spending time with friends etc). You cannot give to others what you don't have left to give, so burning out isn't going to help anyone. I'm sorry that you're all having to deal with this, especially  in the wake of losing Grandma, but your willingness to reach out for help for your Grandpa & your family as a whole says so much about how caring you are & I can only imagine how proud your family is of you! Please know that you can always reach out here, if you've got questions or if you just need to chat/vent. Xo"

dementia,fdku9d0,t1_fdk0b4c,1578511277.0,"I have a nursing background & my Mom has dementia & is waiting in hospital to be transferred to a transitional bed & then to a Long Term Care Fzcility. Even WITH my professional background, this disease has brought me to my knees. To begin, Thank You for caring enough at this point in your career to know that when you're out of your depth, you need to work hard to educate yourself so that you can provide your clients with the BEST possible assistance & care that you can. Kudos! Continue this, right through school AND as you progress in the field. No one knows everything, everyone has different life experiences & if you do it correctly, you will be learning something new every day for the rest of your life. I SO appreciate when staff ask me questions about Mom - what made her tick, what does/did she like to eat or drink, what calms her down, what hobbies did she have, etc. Getting to know your patients at this point as well as building rapport with them will help you to establish the trust they need to have in you. In Canada, we have a Behavioral Observationist that works with the patient & family to be able to provide staff with insight into how to work through the potential hiccups to providing care, specific to each patient. For example, my Mom LOVES music. It is a GREAT motivator. So if she is not eating (a common problem), telling her that after a few more bites, we can put on some Queen or ABBA & dance & she'll be much more likely to acquiesce. They also provide therapeutic techniques to help staff distract from negative behaviors,  attempt to elicit positive behaviours , or reapproach if someone is reluctant to receiving care. Check with your nursing instructor &/or the charge nurse at the facility to see if they have access to anything similar. Additionally, ask seasoned staff questions about what works or doesn't with the clients. Utilize all your resources - check the chart, (ex//see what OT & PT have written in terms of assessments & insghts), speak with family, & ask the client themselves, if possible. To echo another comment, tone & facial/body expressions are SUPER important to be aware of. My Mom's disease process sounds more advanced than that of the client you referenced BUT this totally applies. Do not argue. White lies (the concept of the Noble Lie is something to look up & commit to memory) are okay IF they will de-escalate a client's anxiety & fear & keep them safe. Distraction, distraction, distraction. Ex// My Mom ADORES her new Digital Photo Frame & (while simultaneously helping her to recall family members & friends, at the moment) if you ask her to look at it with you, she will happily forget that a second ago, she was upset that we need to do a dressing change. Continue to treat ALL your patients the way you would want someone to care for your loved ones & you'll be the kind of nurse who is instrumental in improving the quality of the lives of everyone you care for. I wish you every success & your clients will be grateful to have a nurse who cares as much as you do."

My husband asked did I want him to switch to mine, but that felt wrong as well. I didn't want either of us to have to give up a part of our self identity to fulfill some notion. Life went on & then one day, my extra specially amazing partner in crime asked me how I'd feel if we both hyphenated our names together, so that we could share a ""new & improved"" version of our combined last names. Which I totally loved the idea of. The best bit? My surname starts with the letter ""B"", & his with an ""S"", so we are literally now ""Team B.S.""!"
dementia,fddfglv,t1_fdcywwp,1578309885.0,"THIS. Lack of insight is a marker of the disease process & as r/plotthick so artfully put it,  due to the fact that her brain is not able to process data correctly, SHE cannot be the judge of what she needs anymore, in terms of her care. She is likely experiencing fear & confusion & it's heartbreaking to witness as a loved one. You & your family absolutely need to move into the proverbial driver's seat now & Advocate, Advocate, Advocate. Do not sugar coat anything with the professionals - keep notes of  her behaviour (privately & without making her aware) & accept WHATEVER help you can possibly get. Do. Not. Wait. It does not get better, you cannot wait for her to have an epiphany (you cannot reason with someone who can likely no longer process information logically) & the kindest, most loving thing you can do for your Mom (& your whole family, as it affects everyone) is to educate yourselves & act now to give her the best quality of life possible. Something that is 100% true, but also goes against everything she likely taught you, is that a version of the Noble Lie (telling your loved one a lie that is Not intended to hurt them, but intended to help achieve an agenda focused on their greater good. I.e. using the previous example, bring Mom to lunch & have her ""keep you company whilst you get your meds"" & actually bring her to see the doctor) is not a bad thing. Indeed, it is often necessary to prevent undue stress & hardship for someone who doesn't understand why things are necessary but still needs to participate. It feels wrong, but it is often the kindest thing you can do.  I would HIGHLY recommend joining a support group now as this is a very difficult journey for caregivers & family members & the more support you all have, the better. I'm so sorry that this is happening to your Mom, & your family- please reach out if there are any questions we can help with it if you just need to chat/vent. I'm glad your Mon has such a loving, caring family  Xoxo"

dementia,fdcysce,t3_ekjbqq,1578288358.0,"To begin, I'm so sorry that your family is dealing with this. No type of dementia is easy to deal with, especially when it strikes someone down in what should be still the prime of their life.       Next, and this is REALLY important, YOU need to make sure that your mental & physical health is maintained to the best degree you can. Make an appointment with your PCP, inform them as to what is happening in your family, & talk to them about the difficulty sleeping, etc. I would definately recommend seeking out a support group as well, because this is a difficult journey that doesn't HAVE to be as lonely as it may feel now. If you feel suicidal, PLEASE call a hotline or talk with loved ones. I KNOW how mind bogglingly overwhelming this all feels & ALL of it feels like it needs to be done yesterday, but take a breath. YOU CAN HANDLE THIS & YOU DONT NEED TO DO IT ALONE. Bottom line, to help your Mom, Step-Dsd & Grandfather,  (in addition  to being the loving partner & parent you clearly are) you need to make sure that you are OK. You can't help others out of the proverbial pit if you are stuck down there too.                                               On to Mom: 100%, Mom needs to be taken to her PCP, who can hopefully recommend a Geriatrician,  because a diagnosis will help to rally resources. If you are not comfortable with her driving your child, you should not be OK with her out on the road at all, especially not behind the wheel of  a 2 tonne weapon. Your Mom's doctor can be brought up to speed in terms of familial history & your Grandma's experience with the disease, as well as the observations you AND your Step Dad are making regarding her decline. The fact that, if I read your comment correctly, she is a Caretaker to her own elderly father makes the urgency even greater that this be addressed without delay. Write a list of your questions down before you go in to the office, & have your Step Dad & yourself commit to paper a brief history of your Mom's decline (with examples). One of the more frustrating parts of the disease can be the lack of insight the patient has, but we can't use that as an excuse to ostrich ourselves (I know you're not, but believe me, I GET why people are tempted. This is SO hard.) Mom's safety & the safety of those in her reach need to be the co-primary focus & everything else springs from there. You will need to contact a lawyer, after you speak with her PCP. I'm in Canada, & NAL, so I can't speak to how POA works there - (if it automatically would go to Step Dad if Mom is deemed incompetent?), so I'm hoping that either another Redditor or someone from a local support group will have more info. Financially, again, the system is different, but I would look at Medicaid, any insurance she has now, & other programs that her doctor hopefully can point you towards etc to see what she is eligible for.  I know it feels impossible right now, because you are mired in the quicksand of the situation & you feel like you need to save everyone, but you're succumbing yourself .            For context, I have Crohn's, am an Olympic Level Worrier, & have just had to have my Mom deemed incompetent & hospitalized after a year & a half of trying to get her help for dementia. She is waiting to be transferred to a transitional bed in a nursing care home before a Long Term Care Bed is available in a Memory Care type unit. I literally felt like we were about to fall off a precipice before she was brought to hospital because I KNEW she needed more help than she would ever understand she needed & I was so worried about her safety, but felt she was too far into decline to ethically be comfortable with having her sign a POA, & I genuinely didnt know what to do first. And then I found a nasty wound on her thigh, &  I was very concerned about the potential for infection, so circumstances forced our hand. As scared & guilty as I felt bringing her to the hospital, KNOWING that her life would he markedly different afterwards, I am finding peace in the knowledge that she is safe, that medical personnel have confirmed our fears & we are working towards those next steps. It's a LOT, my husband & I have been going almost nonstop since the start of December & we are muddling our way through the legal mess that unfortunately occurs without a POA. But by aligning ourselves with as much support as we can muster, from friends & extended family, support groups & professionals from all care providers, as well as learning to find some balance (making date night a priority again, taking a day off from visiting when we can, remembering to eat well & try to sleep).. we are making it through. And so will you & your family. Dont make ANY important decisions while you feel the way you do... not about ending your life OR giving your Mom a choice she likely is no longer able to competently make. Rally the support wagons, educate yourselves & admit to the medical professionals exactly where things are at, & what the stakes are here. BTW, while yes, this type of Dementia can have a hereditary component, it can ALSO randomly skip generations as well. Bring this concern up with your doctor when you make your appointment. I certainly will be making sure that I have a will & that death with dignity is going to be an important factor in my choices. Please know that you can reach out & chat if you need someone. Thinking about you & your whole family. Xoxo"

His Mom CLEARLY needs more care, your boyfriend does not have enough insight into the sheer magnitude of what it takes, going forward, to actually keep his Mom safe, & you can't force him to ""get there"". Going through this with my Mom currently but she has been hospitalized & is waiting for a Long Term Care Memory Unit bed. The amount of guilt I felt bringing her to the hospital (I was worried she had an infection after I found a mysterious wound on her leg), KNOWING that she likely was never going to be given the opportunity to go home again was almost crushing, but my husband & I had tried EVERYTHING we could for a year & a half to both help her & call attention  to what we realized was a decline in her cognition (other family members found it even more difficult to acknowledge what was happening), & the end result is that we needed to make sure that she was safe, first & foremost. Your boyfriend is struggling to see the reality of what is before him & his Mom. And if he's struggling now, WITH the help of you & his sister, he is going to drown if he moves out with his Mom. I am not sure who, if anybody, is Mom's Power Of Attorney, but if neither your BF or his sister have it yet, I would encourage you & his sister, hopefully with BF on board, to take Mom back to the Doctor's, so that her decline can be documented & her increasing needs can be discussed. His sister may need to further step up if your BF can't be reasoned around to the reality of the situation (I HIGHLY recommend the family members seek out support because it's a horrifically stressful journey to have to be on), & she may need to take legal steps to become a Guardian for her Mom, if Mkmnis no longer competent to sign a POA  (I'm in Canada, so this may look different depending on your location).  From your perspective, you DO need to be cognizant enough of your own needs to know that, at some point, you will have exhausted your ability to be a support IF your BF is not willing/able to recognize your perspective as his partner & you will have to remove yourself or risk sinking into this mire. You can't help either of them get out of the pit if you're down there yourself. And I say this KNOWING the quagmire of guilt, grief, anger, frustration & sadness that your BF is stuck in, as well as how much I value the support that my husband brings. I wish there was an easier answer, Love, but I haven't found a way to make any of this easy. Please know that none of you are alone, though, & that there IS support out there, IF you seek it out.

Up until the day before her 70th Birthday, she lived in an apartment nearby & my husband & I were taking care of her finances, laundry, cleaning, major groceries etc. Suddenly, she stopped bathing & her confusion escalated to the point she wasn't safe (I found a nasty wound on her leg when I finally convinced her to let me help shower her). I was worried about infection, we brought her to the ER (she turned 70 in the waiting room) & she has been hospitalized since the beginning of December. She cannot return home again, & needs too much 1:1 care 24/7 for us/PSW's to be able to keep her safe & so she is in the process of being moved to a ""transitional"" bed until one in a Long Term Care Facility becomes available. This has been like grieving in slow motion. I feel HORRENDOUS having to leave her behind when we visit at ths hospital, but logically I KNOW she's safe & cared for & THAT has to be my primary focus. We're almost looking forward now to the actual move to a permanent Memory Care unit because it will mean routine & company for Mom, & we can decorate it in a way that will bring her as much joy as we can & eventually (I'm still the only one bathing her after a month in hospital, which has been hard as I know she needs to learn to trust staff too), we can resume a relationship where we are primarily Mother & Daughter, instead of Mother & Daughter With A Caretaking Agenda, which is what I've become out of necessity.  I know this all feels raw & wrong, like the order of the world has been turned on its head, but now that Dad is safe, you can work to adding as much love & support to his life that you can, to have as much quality time together as possible.
