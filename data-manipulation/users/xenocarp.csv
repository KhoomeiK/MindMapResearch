worldnews,fecp5zk,t1_feaqbt0,1578979703.0,I think a third almost unimaginable situation will be if Taiwan agrees to go with China but China also agreed to have multi party politics. That will honestly be ideal situation for both people and good for world. Ideal would be the Chinese communist party will provide a stable government and keep policies to ensure the economy and security is on track while also co operating and not hindering rise and spread of other parties as they gain popularity and take part in fair elections. This will take a long time and any stakeholder can derail or try to control the process. Also Taiwan will have more to lose than gain initially and will be at Mercy or how fair the Chinese government is

Next time you guys are talking about it decide on a % that you will commit to give her to invest in gold from your regular investment so say out of $1000 giver her $200 or whatever. Out of this come up with a % of that which will go into gold that is wearable and rest should be gold bars or coins or whatever 24k thing.

todayilearned,fdpzpai,t3_embr52,1578647664.0,"Gold is something one can buy the will increase in value or atleast not go down in value. Ladies here are taught to buy gold at every opportunity possible. One may not buy fancy clothes or big TV or a shiny new phone but they will buy gold, this is insurance.
Second such thing is education. Most Indian mothers will not hesitate to melt some of her gold if it means getting good education for her son (daughter in some cases more n more)

Gold and Education are seen as something that will hold it's value .... It does not matter if you are high caste or low caste, young or old, married or not may be black or white. If you have gold (or these days education) you will survive and will get respect if you lost everything else.

To be honest, for anyone who is young today just start buying gold at any chance possible.... Birthday and want to splurge? Buy gold instead and have a moderate meal. Iwatch? Nope equivalent amount in gold please. Want to replace phone that can be used for a few more years? We'll use the phone for some time and buy gold for money you would have spent. New car ? No, buy gold. 

You will soon realize that not only have you saved money by being thrifty but also the gold you got has increased in value by doing absolutely nothing. The doing absolutely nothing is the important part.

More astute investors will point out here that there are more sophisticated and higher yielding financial instruments out there but they all will require some know how and work on your part.

Gold ? Well gold will increase value even just sitting there collecting dust."

I should have researched this a bit before posting.

Ok I did some searching and came across a news paper write up from 2010 in economic times. Here is a quote

""Originating in South America, it only really came into its own when it drifted up towards the warmth of Mexico where the Aztecs named it ‘tomatl’. It was taken to Europe and cultivated from the 16th century onwards, but suspicions that its bright fruit was poisonous delayed its spread. K.T.Achaya suggests as late as 1850 for its possible date of entry into India, adding that 30 years later Sir George Watts, in his survey of the economic products of India, said that they were mostly grown for Europeans, although “Bengalis and Burmans” were beginning to use it in their “sour curries”

Most pleasant retail related story was when my mom was visiting me and we went to Publix, there they had some plastic containers that were kept with other plastic containers that were considerably cheaper. Me and Mom got a pack and when the cashier rung it, it was different price I think $3 instead of $0.99 so I told her and the manager came and she realized they had mis placed the item. She told me she was sorry and the price is $3....but then she looks at computer, realized they only had 2 left with no inventory coming and said if you buy both of them she will sell them for $0.99 each (instead of $6) and that will save her from allocating a space for them and printing a lable !

What they told me was one of the reasons I decided I need to visit the USA.
They said they ""bought"" the camera and 3 film rolls and used it for 5 days of their NYC vacation and basically just returned the camera and lenses but kept the film !!!!
I was stunned !
When I finally got to US as a graduate student I realized I did not ever even have money to initially buy the camera to return it lol"
