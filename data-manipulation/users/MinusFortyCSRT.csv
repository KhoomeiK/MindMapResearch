Get the fuck out of the relationship right now.

Don’t wait. Don’t walk. Run. Go. Now.

This sort of person will make your life an absolute fucking hell and you will either spend your life feeling guilty or her being angry at you. 

When you start becoming immune to it, which you are, she will escalate and drag friends and family into it. Imagine her bursting to tears in public and you looking like you smacked her.
People will always take her side.

There is no compromise with a person like this.

Get. Out.

The fact that she is doing this over little shit like where to eat ... ought to make you seriously open your eyes over how manipulative she will be over getting her own way for shit that really matters.

worldnews,fdodwyi,t3_emetoy,1578603345.0,"I'm so frustrated over this. Calling it 'accidental' is really, really upsetting me.

All of the major media is calling it 'accidental'!

It's there (Calling it an accident) to absolve Iran of responsibility and culpability to help them save face and prevent more of an international incident. In my view, the death of 63 Canadians is being done a disservice by calling it an accident. They fired on a civilian aircraft, there isn't really anything else to say. It's not an accident, it isn't tragic .. it's just flat out murder.

Blaming Trump for it is a pretty slippery slope too.  Regardless of your beliefs as to what he started or didn't …. it falls apart because as a civilian aircraft, that plane was carrying a transponder that identified it. A mode S transponder CONSTANTLY broadcasts an identification!

Calling it an 'accident' is complete bull because they knew \*exactly\* what it was, and why it was there.

Calling it an accident is spineless and just caters to the Iranian regime.  


Moreover, if people insist it's an accident... this is how it should have been handled:  


""A terrible tragedy happened like this in the middle east once before, with a malfunctioning system on a US Navy Ship that shot down an airliner in the Persian Gulf. America paid 61.8 million dollars in restitution for this. We look forward to Iran's immediate payment or an equivalent amount of international banking assets will be seized by Friday morning. With these monies we can hopefully aid the families affected by this terrible ordeal."""

But if they aren’t sane, confidence is your best friend. It’s not to act crazy it’s to make it clear that you aren’t afraid.
