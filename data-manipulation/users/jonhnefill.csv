pokemongo,ffq8gjp,t3_eukxzk,1580125820.0,Same problem present and reported over multiple accounts in DK as well. Very annoying to have to close and open the game every time this happens. The gyms seem to disappear faster if you have Pokemon Go+ or anything similar.
reddevils,ffq80cz,t3_euhcvs,1580125244.0,The January window is about to close. Is is still realistic that we can even manage one signing? Doesn't really seem Woodward was too keen on making even a single signing.

Scams,ffc25ua,t3_esq7su,1579789653.0,"Someone tried to scam me like this once. But I've seen so many variations of the Skype scams. One nagged me for weeks to send them money so they could buy a webcam or something (I think this is the variation of the scam where the amount start low and then increase).

I've had the ""Let's get nude on webcam"" scam attempted on me (I'm generally reserved about sending pictures of my junk and I barely do so when asked to by women I know really well), so I just blocked that right away (this has also been attempted through fake Facebook profiles on me). 

The funniest were some two dudes from Turkey who obviously just got extremely bored and decided to set up a fake profile on Skype and just added someone randomly. Me in this instance. They chat for about two weeks and then finally ""she"" (they) ask me to video chat. I turn on the video chat, and it's just those two guys laughing and shouting fuck you or something. Couldn't help but to smile and wave at them before I closed the call and blocked them."

Slagsmálum.

depression,ff8owyv,t3_es440i,1579689574.0,"A popular advice I got was to just go outside and walk more. Not that exercise doesn't help, but when you are constantly fighting on your own head every day, and you add on that external factors (I lost my job, I lost my apartment, I didn't get unemployment benefits, many of my friends stopped talking to me because I could barely afford food), then you just get tired. For the first time in my life last summer I understood those who have opted out. It's not because they felt sorry for themselves. But being constantly tired, and constantly battling your own mind just wears you down. Until you don't have any more fight in you.

I opted to seek all the help I could find. I figured everything I had tried to get better clearly had only made matters worse, so I just gave up on trying to this myself and sought out every medial and mental health professional I could. I'm obviously not cured, but I'm getting to a much better place. That's a welcomed progress."

AskMen,feezd4h,t1_fedi8os,1579044567.0,"Pretty much follow what's been said here. I'd like to add that you should also take care of yourself, both physically and mentally. Dress nicely (designer clothes are not necessary, but colors and clothes that fit you well), skin cream, hairstyle, maybe a bit of aftershave, nice shoes etc. This all helps to make you feel good about yourself (and women do tend to notice you quicker if you take good care about your appearance. It should be noted however that this is by no means the first or the only thing they notice about us). 

Go to the gym or just try to stay physically active whenever you feel like it (hiking, sports whatever you like). This helps you to blow of steam and this can help you take your mind of whatever might be bothering you. 

Smile more often, strike up a casual conversation with someone to practice your social skills. Whether it's in real life, or on a dating app I just try a conversation breakers like ""What's your favorite transformer"", ""Do these socks make me look fat"" or something equally silly. Sometimes it works, sometime it doesn't. 

But ultimately it's all about being happy with who you are as a person, and how you can get to that point."

The Extremist is obsessed with IV's and movesets. Shinies are secondaries to him, but a nice added value nonetheless. The will plan their raid tours according to how many raids can be done within that specific group within a given time span. Raid hours are when they shine. 

Filling the Pokedex is another thing they care a lot about, and will hunt for high IV's and the best move set, even though they never intend to use that Pokemon for battle or defending gyms. Those are ones with an army of maxed out 98% Blissey's they casually throw in gyms."
