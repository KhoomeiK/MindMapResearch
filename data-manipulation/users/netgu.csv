It's more like:

- Get a local git checkout of your ansible repo and make your changes
- Edit a configuration file content/template and maybe inventory/roles/etc. and commit
- Run an ansible command to apply

I use a proxmox template + cloud-init to ensure my ansible SSH keys are always configured on new machines so I can remotely apply playbooks to the fleet.

The advantage of the repo (aside from all the reasons to use a VCS) is that automated CI/CD tools can respond to VCS events.

In my lab, my workflow is:

- Edit my git repo
- Commit and push

My Jenkins instance gets a webhook trigger on commits to my local gitlab instance and a few shell commands are ran to apply playbooks to inventoried machines they apply to and record the output.

In other words, I edit some files and do a git push. That is my entire workflow.  The log of what has happened is maintained in jenkins and the why is in the git commit history.

I never login to the boxes I provision in the lab to configure/manage them unless something goes kaboom and can't be fixed by editing a playbook.  And then usually - the machine is destroyed anyways and rebuilt to ensure the playbook adjustments work correctly from both a new and in-flight machine state."

So then none of what you want to do with it is ""heavy-weight"".  If all the infrastructure to do it that way literally already exists and is in place, then anything else is going to be ""heavier"".  That is my main point.

>I get that DevOps is the current thing, I worked in IT long enough to see many, many methodologies come and go. I also saw a lot of people trying to hammer square pegs into round holes, because of their devotion to the current flavour of the month.

Has nothing to do with ""flavour of the month"", long before DevOps was that  soup-of-the-day, I would have recommended doing the exact same thing with an appropriate tool of the time - such as CFEngine.

Using a configuration manager, orchestrator, and source control is ABSOLUTELY not a ""flavour of the month"".  It is ""the right way"" to do it and has been since long before the term ""DevOps"" starting flying out of every fancy-pants managers mouth.

If you don't want to use your existing tools for the purpose they were developed for and want to re-invent the wheel for no reason then go ahead.  If you are legitimately asking about the easy/right/correct/simplest/most-straightforward way to handle the issue, then stick to what is meant for that - especially when it is already sitting right next to you.
