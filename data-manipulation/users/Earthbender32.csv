AskRedditAfterDark,ffs7lvf,t1_ffratbg,1580175119.0,"I'm not going to weigh in on the main part of this, please don't take this as me saying I'm better than anyone here. I'm not taking sides either.

1. Yes, Reddit has a bandwagon mentality, but that's just people in general.
2. u/NCBull910, some people are too easily influenced, that's a fact. But it seems that you can't have your mind changed by anything, which is just as dangerous, if not more so.
3. I don't think trying to retaliate is going to do anything for you here, your comments are somewhat crude, and repeatedly so, which already puts people on the side of u/Call_Me_Ddy. Instead you should've tried to at least apologize, this display of aggressiveness is kinda making you seem like an uncivilized jackass.
4. In society, and sometimes on the internet, people tend to empathize better with females more than males. Like in scenarios of accusations, if a male is accused of sexual misconduct at a workplace, and is confirmed to not have done anything, his reputation will never recover. If a female is accused of the same thing with the same outcome, the accuser (especially a male accuser), will be called a monster, bastard, and many other only partially justified things.
5. I'm not taking sides, I don't have an opinion, I'm just pointing out how this is a hopeless scenario for u/NCBull910."
