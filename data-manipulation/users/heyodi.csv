JonBenetRamsey,ffguuu0,t1_ffgtbaa,1579915646.0,This is where my thinking goes too. The fact that he owned a subsidiary of a major defense contractor seems important to me.

twinflames,fffwwr3,t3_et79cn,1579893588.0,"We were long distance for about a year and it was extremely hard. Being together is like having a closed circuit where electricity is able to flow. It ignites parts of you that you didn’t know existed and living is simply a lot more natural and easier. Being apart after experiencing that is very difficult. When we finally were able to be together full time, the dynamic didn’t change per say, but our relationship definitely got stronger and better. It’s to a point where we miss each other if we have to go to the store. I know it sounds immature, but that’s part of it for us. He’s my best friend and my favorite person in this world. He makes everything more fun, interesting, and easy. Being together is just bliss. It’s hard to fully explain because there’s nothing else really to compare it to."

antiMLM,ffc80m5,t3_esugvp,1579793651.0,"“At stores that have multiple brands of the same product so that I can try and choose which one I like best. And I can be objective in my decision because I don’t feel obligated to buy a certain brand from someone I personally know. And these stores don’t claim all of the products as their own. That’s not their business. Their business is being a REtailer. They house products from multiple companies, forcing said companies to have competitive pricing and quality. That’s the beauty of retail. They don’t have stand alone products being sold by individuals so desperate to change their current circumstance that they’ll guilt every person they know to try their product or join their team in hopes of making a measly profit on a product that wouldn’t last a month in a retail store.”"

JonBenetRamsey,ffbzi3j,t3_eskt2e,1579787608.0,"In Patsy’s ‘interrogation’, when it was brought up that there were voices captured after she thought she’d hung up, her whole attitude changed. She kept trying to get them to play it for her before she answered any questions about it. She really could be quite manipulative and it shows best in her interrogation. 
I’ve never been able to make out “what did you find?” from that audio. I think it’s something else, but not sure what."
