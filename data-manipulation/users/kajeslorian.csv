If me and my three friends queue up for alliance raid, and our lowest ilvl person qualifies for a HW Alliance, we should be guaranteed to get one of those on rotation. The only downside I could see is that the only people that would end up in the Crystal tower raids would be higher level folks queuing with a lower-level friend, a higher level person who is purposefully cheesing their ilvl, or an entire group of newer players, which would actually make the Crystal tower series a challenge (which could be seen as a good thing or a bad thing).
