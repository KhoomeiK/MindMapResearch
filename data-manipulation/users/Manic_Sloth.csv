tumblr,ffoylxh,t3_euevie,1580083357.0,"Can we make a subreddit where we get drunk, and describe an animal only in terms of other animals and then everyone guesses what we mean? 

I say drunk, because at the time the average person hadn't seen 46,500 hours of Animal Planet and therefore we have an advantage of a point of reference. 

Imagine for a moment you have never seen an animal not local to your area! I would have only seen dogs, cats, birds, horses, racoons, squirrels, and from time to time porcupines, snakes, and rarely deer or bears. 

Then show me basically anything from Africa or Asia. Try to have me draw an elephant or rhinos."

atheism,ffce5sz,t1_ffahct2,1579797520.0,"I do like biographics on YouTube as well because they take the same stance to history, which obviously overlaps with religious, cultural and political climates during which the events occurred, but it's focus very much remains on the biography. 

The host does a podcast too that I've been enjoying called The Brainfood Show but it's a bit more casual/informal that I'd prefer. Still great though!"

Psychonaut,feml7iv,t3_epyotx,1579261054.0,"I've been thinking along a similar thread: it seems most people have trips that are similar in style and tone, and I'm curious as to why that would be.

For example, when you talk about psychedelic art, there is a particular aesthetic that seems to come up often, despite the fact that styles of art in general are basically infinite. 

I'd love to be able to chart the similarities and differences in the psychedelic experience and find out why they exist. 

I'm super interested in seeing the replies to your question, OP!"
