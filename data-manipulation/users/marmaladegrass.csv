Stopping cats from jumping on things? Good luck! You can use a water bottle, or another form of aversion (loud noises), or just remove him when he jumps on the counter. However, when you're not home, he still may (my cats are currently nibbling on the leaves of the pineapple I bought, when I'm not home).

Ripping up furniture? Sisal posts or a cardboard cat scratcher. I have those, and the ONLY item my cats have scratched to shit is a fabric kitchen chair (tbf, it is an old chair, and was primarily done by a rescue I kept sequestered from the rest...I..don't think she knew how to cat...).

My cats don't go outside, as I cannot afford that time (I have 5!) and they are skittish. As well, if it's anything like how they bug for food, it would be a nightmare.

For the porch, you may be able to enclose it with chicken wire, or something else, to prevent him from bolting. Just ensure he can't rip it with his nails.

I'd ensure he has a few places he can look outside to see the wild life, or his cat lands. Mine use an old air hockey table, and lounge in the sun whilst looking out the backyard."
