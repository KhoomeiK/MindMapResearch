Baking,ff3ijnz,t3_erggbg,1579541786.0,"My great grandma used to make these cakes for us when I was growing up and I wanted to try my hand at it. I felt my bestie’s 30th was a good occasion. Took me about 8 hours with baking and forgetting ingredients. It’s 7ish chocolate layers, had an Oreo buttercream filling, and vanilla buttercream outside."
90DayFiance,fejys7w,t1_fejyj02,1579188915.0,Oh dayum. These bitches lying!! Good work!
90DayFiance,fejx3a8,t3_epe2pt,1579187838.0,"Not defending, just truly curious. Is that Instagram even reliable? She’s in the U.K. becoming a doctor with kids? Right there that post lost credibility. All I see is her being tagged in it, which is not enough verification for me. I get tagged in shit all the time that I have no idea about. Help me understand!!"
dogpictures,fejuw9e,t3_epdygd,1579186405.0,Thinking about her and sending good vibes! Have you decided to remove the tumor and or tap the abdomen?
VetTech,feju7y1,t3_epevkt,1579185958.0,"I was confused at what I was looking at first. I saw the nail clippers, a hand, and some crazy looking blobs. I was like wtf did this guy cut off his finger nails!? Then I looked at the sub reddit and realized where I was. 
So huge!!"
bayarea,feiu38q,t3_ep9w9r,1579147240.0,"Walnut Creek, Concord, Pleasant Hill, Pittsburg. Pittsburg is the furthest from SF(45 miles), which is where I live. My boyfriend has to be at work by 5am and he can leave by 4am, absolutely no traffic. I have to be at work by 8am. I cannot leave any later than 6:10am, otherwise I’m late. Bart makes life easier, but it’s not safe and not clean. Good luck!"
aww,fe2kl2r,t1_fe2i4vj,1578839548.0,"Stop wanting a dog for looks or because of breed traits (go and spend time with SHELTER dogs (shelters and rescues are not the same!))? Or be prepared to wait for a breed specific rescue to approve you. If you buy from a breeder and they don’t make you sign a contract saying you promise to spay/neuter at a year old, it’s not necessarily a reputable breeder. (The breeder should want to protect itself from randoms breeding their lineage). If you choose a breeder who constantly has dogs ready they aren’t reputable, they are a mill."
aww,fe2jpeh,t1_fe2amdp,1578839195.0,They all went to rescues because they were looking for specific breeds and or traits. Rescues always have way higher criteria. Because they don’t euthanize for space.
aww,fe2j9g4,t1_fe29opd,1578839021.0,"Go to your city shelter, not a breed specific rescue  or any rescue, and you’ll have an easier time.  I once knew a vet who got declined from a rescue to adopt because he wasn’t home enough."
dogpictures,fe03jnx,t1_fe03elo,1578802177.0,Hahaha I agree! I worked the spay/neuter program for a year at an actual shelter and it killed me. I also volunteered with their pitbull program and it was terrible knowing every week or so that animals I played with and loved prior had been euthanized for space.
dogpictures,fe03ddb,t1_fdygujw,1578802055.0,Yes!! True!
dogpictures,fe03918,t1_fe00v5j,1578801968.0,"I live in America so I can’t speak to other countries. But what you sound like describes my shelter, but we aren’t an actual city shelter. We are a non profit rescue. So we aren’t mandated to take every animal. City shelters which are funded by the city must take in every animal."
dogpictures,fdxzapz,t1_fdwkkm7,1578774430.0,"Every shelter that is funded by the city or government is a kill shelter or has the possibility of being a kill shelter. Rescues are no kill because they get to go to shelters and cherry pick which dogs they want to take. Shelters are legally obligated to take in any abandoned or stray animal. Therefore if the community is responsible for their own animals then the shelters don’t have to kill because there is plenty of space. There are good and bad shelters, but every shelter kills. Not because they want to, because they have to.
