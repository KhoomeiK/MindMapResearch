Archivists,ffd3ix2,t1_ffcprpk,1579812711.0,"If you're still in a major metro area, you might check around and see if any of the local schools offers an ""archival technician"" program (the federal government's designation), or something with a similar name. It's generally a one-year or two-year program in the more practical aspects of preservation and whatnot.

I had two of them working for me, one with a specialty in photography-preservation (we had accumulated a very large photo collection) and one who did manuscript preservation. They earned about the same pay as a senior library clerk, which wasn't bad.

There are a bunch of Archival Tech positions at the NARA branches around the country, and if there's a branch near you, it might be worth your while to go for a visit and chat them up."
Archivists,ffchwr0,t3_esux1f,1579799822.0,"You have NO degree at all? Not even a bachelor's? I don't know of any way you could qualify as a professional archivist then.

My certification, in the early '80s, was part of my second master's degree, in which was in history. I could also have picked it up earlier, as part of my first master's, which was in library science, but the certification program was *not* available as part of any undergrad degree program. Not in Texas, anyway, and I think that's still the case pretty much everywhere.

An archival certification is an add-on thing, not a standalone process. In my case, it required an extra 9 hours of coursework (both theoretical and practical -- including a fair amount of conservation chemistry, which was the hardest part for me), plus a semester-long hands-on project in organizing, preserving, calendaring, and writing user guides for a a collection of significant size. So, not just something you could do online or through a community college or whatever.

Rural and small-town Texas is still trying to cling to the 19th century, but they're being slowly but firmly defeated in that by the fact that FIVE of the nation's 13 largest cities are located in Texas. Texas is FAR more heavily urbanized than most outsiders realize.

And all those Texas cities are pretty much like urban areas everywhere else in the country in terms of relatively liberal politics, liberal social views, and the willingness these days of younger residents to move easily from one city to any other city in the country for their jobs. So cities all over the country cross-pollinate with each other and *none* of them gets along with their surrounding conservative hinterlands.

Compare the situation in Texas to Louisiana, which has only one semi-large city -- and that ranks #50 in size in the U.S. The entire rest of the state is ""hinterland."" Same problem in Alabama, which has only Birmingham, and Mississippi, where Jackson, the largest city, is only 3/4 the size of Baton Rouge.

Jim and Franny Post, card-carrying New Yorkers, have been together for thirty-five years and have two kids: Bobby, nearly thirty and trying to make a living pushing real estate in Miami, and Sylvia, eighteen and two weeks away from leaving for Brown (and, she hopes, *never* coming back to the family brownstone). They’ve been planning a two-week trip to Mallorca as a sort of multilevel celebration -- their anniversary and their daughter’s departure for college -- and they’ve got the tickets and everything, when Jim is suddenly let go from his long-time position as editor for a high=quality gentlemen’s lifestyle magazine. Well, he resigned, actually. Well, he had to, actually. Too late to change their plans now, but Jim knows he’s going to be paying for his transgression every day they’re there.

So, off they go, accompanied by Bobby and his personal trainer girlfriend (who is ten years his senior) and also by Charles, Franny’s (gay) best male friend for forty years, and Charles’s husband, Lawrence, who tries hard not to be jealous of Charles and Franny’s slightly strange relationship. Sylvia, who kind of knows what her father did (her brother has no idea), has her own plans for the trip, mostly losing her virginity. And the Spanish tutor her mother has lined up for her is a real hunk, so she has high hopes. Bobby has plans, too: Getting his folks to help him out of the financial hole he has dug for himself in the Florida real estate slump. And Charles and Lawrence are waiting to hear from an adoption agency, so there’s that, too.

In this sort of straightforward narrative, pacing is everything. Straub handles this in an explicit and equally straightforward fashion, by naming the chapters “Day 1,” “Day 2,” and so on for the two weeks of their stay. Things happen each day, and then they all go to bed, and you wonder what will happen when they all get up the next morning and have second and third and tenth thoughts. It’s the best kind of episodic storytelling. And you really don’t know whether the story is going to end with a divorce (possibly more than one), or whether Sylvia will go to college still a virgin, or whether Bobby’s days in Florida are numbered. Properly cast, this would make a terrific film

Jodi Taylor's **[What Could Possibly Go Wrong?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25634043-what-could-possibly-go-wrong)** is the sixth outing for the crew of historians at St. Mary’s Institute, in one of the best time-travel adventure series ever conceived, and the theme is stated explicitly in the title -- because anything that can go wrong does. Max had some necessary knee surgery done and isn’t very mobile at the moment, so she and Peterson have swapped jobs for awhile and she’s now the Chief Training Officer, with responsibility for getting a newly arrived squad of five young historian recruits up and running in a revised and much accelerated program. (All the battles they’ve fought recently have left the Institute very shorthanded.) That means carefully selected instructive missions with a minimum of danger, like going back to survey the undiscovered tombs in the Valley of the Kings, and recording a Paleolithic mammoth hunt, and (in order to acclimate the trainees to violent death) witnessing the burning of Joan of Arc. And while the Battle of Bosworth Field was definitely not on Max’s itinerary, they get caught up in that, too. Combine all that with Max trying to get used to her recent marriage to Leon and all bets are off. Every time I finish one of these yarns, I wonder how Taylor could possibly top it the next time, but she manages to do exactly that. There’s some really first-rate writing here, as well as (as I have said before) an excellent grasp of what the past was really like.

David Yoon's debut novel, **[Frankly in Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39847584-frankly-in-love)**, is a YA romance, but with a considerably different slant than most. Frank Li is a California-born Korean-American nerdish teenager whose grasp of his ancestral language is rudimentary at best. He thinks of himself most of the time, as simply “American.” His mostly unassimilated parents, who only ever think of themselves as “Korean,” run a convenience store but they managed to buy a house and have no debts.

Frank’s older sister, Hanna (named after the place where “Puff the Magic Dragon” came from) went to Harvard and graduated with honors, ditto Harvard Law School, and her parents were extremely proud of her success -- until she fell in love with a black guy, at which point she ceased to exist as far as they were concerned. His parents’ casual racism about anyone who isn’t Korean drives Frank crazy, a feeling shared by the children of his Korean-American friends regarding their own parents. Because a group of families who came from the Old Country together gather for dinner once a month and none of the kids can escape the feeling of being trapped forever by their ethnicity. But then Frank courts trouble himself by falling for an Anglo girl in his class. He has to keep their developing relationship a secret from everyone if he doesn’t want to be cast out like his sister. One of his friends from the Gathering, Joy Song (her parents and Frank’s have been aiming the two of them at each other for years), has a similar problem; her boyfriend is Chinese-American, which would also be forbidden if her parents ever found out. The solution Frank and Joy come up with, of course, is to pretend-date each other, strictly for family consumption, and then sneaking off with their real SOs. This is almost a cliché, but the author does some very original things with it, and with the issues of racism, isolation from family, and falling in love. And the story won’t end the way you expect, either.

Yoon does a lovely job with all his characters, especially Frank’s best friend, Q, a fellow nerd and brilliant student who happens to be black, and whose own folks consider Frank one of their family. The other members of the Gathering are depicted in a nuanced fashion as well, and Yoon’s writing style is well above the average. And apparently there’s a sequel in the works, which I’ll be very interested to see. David’s wife, by the way,  is Nicola Yoon, already a well-regarded YA novelist."

First of all, NOT all genre fiction is successful, popular, or lucrative. Sturgeon's Law, remember. God knows, there's plenty of dreck out there.

But fiction, by its very nature is written for the consumption of other people. If you write a book and then stick it in a drawer and no one ever sees it, who's to say whether it's great fiction or not? Getting people to spend their money on a book -- or a painting, or a piece of music -- is what counts as success in the long run.

If I buy a new novel, and I really enjoy it, and I talk it up to my friends, and they buy it and enjoy it, then that judgment -- the judgment of the masses, not of some academic tribunal  -- argues strongly for the quality of the book. A badly written book isn't going to get that kind of public reaction. And that's REALLY all that counts: Is a boo well written or poorly written? Nothing else about it matters until that question is answered.

Literary academics will usually argue that a major bestseller by Stephen King, or whoever, CAN'T be ""literature"" (by their narrow definition) simply because it IS genre.

Science fiction authors and their fans have been fighting that fight for decades. ""Oh, yes, that book by Ursula LeGuin actually is quite good -- so it isn't *really* science fiction.""

And that's an elitist attitude: ""Only we, the academic critics, know what constitutes important fiction, not the mere readers."" And that's what I object to.

And I hear the same thing from the elitist musical crowd: Some obscure Danish or Ukrainian composer's atonal compositions that only a few dozen self-styled experts pretend to understand MUST be more important than the music of the Beatles or The Who, regardless of the millions of avid fans of the latter. That's elitist, by definition."

And assuming you're presently under 49 years of age, that means your childhood reading obviously was not sufficiently broad for you to be aware of his earlier published work, even though it was out there.

Got it?"

If a three-year-old gets away from his mother nd runs blindly out into traffic from between two cars parked at the curb, and gets hit and killed -- that's an accident. The driver is not in any way culpable. It's a random occurence and a tragedy, but there's no blame to be laid. (Except perhaps on the mother who didn't sufficiently control her kid.)

This actually happened to a woman I worked with many years ago. She was a mother herself and it took her a long time to forgive herself for what had happened, even though -- rationally -- she knew it wasn't her fault. What's more, the mother of the child didn't blame her, either, and the two women actually got together to share their grief.

The case under discussion, however, is quite different. The driver KNEW the crosswalk was there. He KNEW he was supposed to watch for children crossing. He KNEW he was supposed to stop. Whether he was drunk, or texting, or thinking about something else, or just didn't give a shit -- it doesn't matter. This was not in any way an ""accident."" Which is to say, it could easily have been prevented, if the driver was doing what he was supposed to be doing.

I've also experienced this, unfortunately. In 1999, shortly before I retired, my immediate superior was also a long-time close friend. (We had leap-frogged each other several times on the career ladder over the years, which was fine with both of us.) Her husband was taking her eight-year-old daughter to a dance class or something. The light had just changed at an intersection and he had pulled out, not going very fast, when a large SUV slammed into him from the cross-street. My friend's husband was dead at the scene. Her daughter survived but lost an arm.

The other driver was young and was speeding because he was in  hurry to get someplace and nobody else's safety mattered to him. There was no way it was anything other than negligent homicide (at the very least) -- but the judge called it an ""accident"" and the culprit did six months in the county jail. SIX MONTHS. For a culpable death and a maiming. 

This sort of injustice is why I have strong views on self-absorbed, arrogant drivers who kill people."

I was waiting for this. Try to talk about HISTORY and you get accused of being a present-day supporter of a now-unacceptable political position.

I'm not 300 years old. I wasn't present at the Constitutional Convention -- all the members of which must be EVIL because they accepted the existence of slavery, right?

My ancestors all arrived here in the 17th & 18th centuries via Pennsylvania, and Maryland, and Virginia. And they all ended up in the Ohio Valley and the Midwest and points west. And not a slaveowner among them. My Civil War ancestors fought in units from Indiana and Iowa. I've spent all my life in Texas, but I was born in Toledo. I was an Army brat who grew up all over the world, exposed to the values of many different cultures.

I'm also been a lefty-liberal Democrat since the Kennedy campaign in 1960, and I have no use whatever for Confederate-flag-wavers, so watch who you're calling names.

But I'm also a professional archivist and genealogist with several history degrees and I know the difference between history and current politics. I'm very familiar with the history of slavery in this country. I did my second Master's thesis under Randolph Campbell on the ""planters and plain folk"" hypothesis in antebellum Texas, and I had seminars on the subject with Richard Lowe and Stephen Maizlish, all of them recognized experts in that field.

Slaves were expensive to purchase and expensive to maintain. The *average* slave in the South in 1850 cost $40-$50 thousand in today's money. No planter in his right mind casually abused expensive property, any more than a modern-day trucker would casually abuse his 16-wheeler.

The pictures you sometimes see of a slave tied to a whipping post were the very rare exception, and the practice wasn't indulged in for minor infractions of discipline.

Genealogy,fedlca6,t3_eol9aj,1579014369.0,"You're imagining Simon Legree and *Gone with the Wind*, which is NOT accurate for most of the pre-1865 South, for most of its history.

""Overseer"" just means he was the manager of the work force, which in Virginia meant slaves. Some small farmers in the South -- and ""small"" meant the overwhelming majority -- might have owned one or two slaves, but most owned none at all. That was a manor capital investment, well beyond the means of many farmers & planters (which are two different occupations, by the way).

Many farmers *rented* a few slaves from a commercial broker to help out during the harvest, in which case the farmer himself oversaw the workers. Having a full-time overseer (who was frequently just one of the planter's older sons) implies that the planter was wealthy enough to own large amounts of land, which required a large full-time work force.

An overseer's job was no different in essence than that of a full-time ""farm manager"" in the North, who oversaw the hired hands on a large farm.
