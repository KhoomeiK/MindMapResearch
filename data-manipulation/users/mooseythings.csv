Jan being alexis's daughter is cool because you understand where Jan might be in the drag scene. dahlia just straight up looks like she was on her way to an Aja impersonator contest and stopped by after. boot.

(especially because Aja isn't quite the figure she was immediately after AS3)"

DestinyTheGame,ffg4gm5,t3_et7ctd,1579898255.0,"one thing I'd like to see is a separation of ghost shell, skin, shader(s), and effects. for example, sagira is a super unique shell, but the only modification is shader. but, for something like the standard geometric base ghost shell, what's the difference between two different named ghost shells that still use the same model?

maybe, once you complete curse of osiris's story, you could then change the shell from basic geometric to Sagira Shell. then, if you wanted, you could implement a cool ribbed or shiny texture, and then put a shader over that even. hell, then let some effects like the solar/arc/void shells or eris's green orb shell all be effects you can stack even further. 

honestly, same for sparrows and ships. there's no reason to have dozens of ships when its just a texture change on the same model. let us just unlock the texture rather than an entirely different ship. 

finally, if all of this IS too memory intensive, which I expect it would be, just put it at holliday in the tower like D1. no one really needs to change their armor or ghost appearances from the memory, just the ability to change a few presets already made."
Ingrown_Toenails,fffzeau,t3_etbmzc,1579895131.0,"well. you're an absolute idiot. but i'm glad you finally decided to go to the doctor before something much much worse happened infection/damage wise (for the record, I've never even heard of a bone infection tbh). can you still play hockey now that you've healed? will they eventually be able to destroy the bed once time has passed or is it not even worth all of that?"
