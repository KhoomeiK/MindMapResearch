todayilearned,few3gcj,t1_felqqsx,1579404806.0,Yes that's what I think too. I didn't know much about organ donation so I didn't want to blindly agree to anything without doing some more research first.
todayilearned,felnmwz,t1_felm5f1,1579226497.0,"I agree now, but at 16 it was a big question to think about and one that I wasn't expecting to be asked. After thinking it over it makes perfect sense but at the time the idea was intimidating."
todayilearned,felnfwx,t1_fellhct,1579226363.0,"Yep, same here. Planning on changing it once my renewal comes up, but going in the first time, it was a lot to think about"
todayilearned,felh32w,t1_felbthq,1579222012.0,"I don't think it's about paperwork. I can't speak for anybody else but I opted out of organ donation the first time I got my license. I was 16 at the time and I think when people are asked about their opinion regarding what would happen to them in the event of their death, they tend to kick the can down the road and figure that they'll ""figure it out later"". They don't want to opt *in* to something because that's like making a decision; if they just abstain from it, then they haven't committed to anything yet. That was my logic, anyway (which is silly in retrospect but the 'opt-in' option made it sound like something most people wouldn't want to do, and I didn't know what those reasons might be, so I didn't check the box.)"
VirginiaPolitics,felgh68,t1_felffaw,1579221611.0,"Gotcha, thank you! So March 3 is for the presidential primaries and June 9 is for everybody else's primaries?"
languagelearning,fef7s0j,t1_fech6d0,1579050196.0,"Sure, of course! I noticed that too as I was writing them down, haha. 
DM me and we can figure something out?"
languagelearning,fec885v,t1_febx44e,1578968357.0,"Wow thank you!! That would be amazing!
If you can find the time to read the Italian words off of the list in the original post and upload them as some kind of audio file somewhere (mp4 or something similar) that would be amazing. You don't have to read the English ones, but you can if you want to help set a pace :) Just put a few seconds in between each Italian word so I can cut them out and put them into a video.

No obligations of course, it's probably a bit time consuming but if you're able to do it send me the file and I can keep you updated on the video :)"
worldnews,fdj0mgg,t1_fdizlzr,1578455419.0,"I wasn't sure, I put ""recently"" to cover my bases, not to imply that there had been attacks prior to this"
AskTrumpSupporters,fdj0fjh,t1_fdisp96,1578455286.0,I might be mistaken here but I don't think Congress formally declared war on Vietnam or Korea right? I don't think Congress has formally declared war since WWII.
AskTrumpSupporters,fdj03gp,t1_fdiw44k,1578455053.0,I'm not agreeing with the defense of Soleimani per se here but the fact that he was a government official makes his assassination a lot stickier politically. I don't think there's any question that he deserved what he got from a moral perspective. But killing Soleimani has graver political consequences than killing someone like Bin Laden. It's (whether Americans see it this way or not) another example for the Iranians of Americans sticking their hands into Iranian politics. I wouldn't be surprised if even the Iranians who hate Soleimani are probably not exactly thrilled that it was an American president specifically who took him out.
worldnews,fdizghi,t3_eljp1u,1578454614.0,This is going to sound incredibly stupid but what is the specific significance of this attack? Is it headliner news because it's the presumed response to the assassination of Soleimani? Or has Iran not attacked U.S. bases recently and it's a sign of serious escalation? I don't know the extent of the recent conflict between Iran and the U.S. or to what degree they've been openly or covertly fighting each other in the last few years so I don't know how unusual this attack is.
worldnews,fdbei8x,t3_ekedm9,1578256608.0,"Didn't he say the same thing about targeting terrorists' families a while back? Isn't this par for the course?

I checked out the AskTrumpSupporters thread about this and even they can't come up with a plausible excuse for this behavior. These threats of violence and inhumanity are deeply disturbing."
CasualConversation,fcz78gb,t3_ejglqo,1578095081.0,"Thanks for reminding me :) I just stopped by to donate as well, been meaning to do it for a while."
worldnews,fcz75v9,t1_fcz54lx,1578095039.0,I know right! Cheers :)
worldnews,fcz7336,t1_fcz3y82,1578094994.0,I'm not defending Trump by any means here but your reply didn't really answer the question. What about Obama's drone strikes?
graphic_design,fcz4h6m,t1_fcxic12,1578093484.0,"That's a good idea, I think I'll implement that :)

Thank you so much!!! This has been an exemplary critique and I really appreciate all your feedback!"
graphic_design,fcw2di5,t1_fcubqxy,1578015547.0,"I mean that unfortunately that awful type choice was required for the design :/ it was a contest entry, [you can see the past winners at this link here.](https://pabstblueribbon.com/art-contest-c/) The design had to fit within a pre-designed template that included that text and wasn't allowed to be altered. 

I may just adjust it myself for portfolio purposes, I agree it looks awful, but I never know whether it's better to show real work I've done for clients (or contests, in this case) even if they have some ugly client preferences/requirements, or whether it's better to show a cleaner, nicer design that I've edited despite client preferences."
graphic_design,fcrz8yl,t1_fbgsn6c,1577908806.0,"Thank you thank you thank you! Your last paragraph really resonated with me, it's a little scary. I have ADD and I tend to get swept up in the beginning of the project and then quit at the end because I'm either so frustrated with the project I just want it over with or I lose interest.

This is a bit of a tangent, but I was also curious if you had any advice for how to display pieces that had certain requirements or client needs? For example, [in this piece](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aeeada_a897203826bf464d92cf6b550ce678d7~mv2_d_3948_3518_s_4_2.png/v1/fill/w_842,h_750,al_c,q_95,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/aeeada_a897203826bf464d92cf6b550ce678d7~mv2_d_3948_3518_s_4_2.webp), you mentioned that the two bottom rectangles ""looked awkward"" - I wholeheartedly agree, they were a required part of the design unfortunately (the design was a contest entry and had to fit inside a predesigned template). I want to more effectively communicate what parts of my work were mine and what parts were company brand standards/client preferences. Do you have any thoughts? (I apologize for mining you for advice like this! Your analysis has been really helpful)"
IAmA,fcog8bd,t1_fcnsmwd,1577831481.0,Yeah this is what I've always thought too. It's amazing what kind of hardship you're able to survive once you have no other choice.
internetparents,fcodz37,t1_fcmp3wr,1577829914.0,"I disagree, NY Times and WaPo are generally accurate and well researched. They do lean left (no news site is free of bias after all) but they are generally well written and far less sensationalist."
internetparents,fcodln1,t3_ehxanl,1577829649.0,"* I recommend starting by picking a few news outlets and checking them once a day; click through the front page articles, the politics articles, the U.S. articles, and the world articles.

* This might be a little more controversial but I would also recommend looking at a variety of sources, not just the most neutral ones (though obviously I would put more stock/trust in the reporting from high-quality news sources). Check CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News, even if they're more inflammatory or opinionated than NPR, the New York Times, or the Washington Post - it's not only good to be politically informed, but it's good practice to be aware what 'the other side' is thinking as well. This will help you avoid pitfalls like the 2016 election where educated 'elite' voters were so out of touch with everyday working-class Americans. At least be aware of how the other side views things and interprets events, even if you don't rely on them as much for accuracy. 

* If you're getting conflicting information from different sites about a certain event, branch off and do your own research as well. Use the headline news as a jumping point for more nuanced research. 

* If you are reading a newspaper, ALWAYS CHECK WHETHER IT IS LABELLED ""OPINION"" OR ""ANALYSIS"". These articles voice the author's *opinion*, they are not traditional news articles. *Also understand that that does not mean they are not worth reading*. An opinion article can be well written, researched, and presented! Opinions are worth reading, just understand what their purpose is and realize that they are not a neutral, facts-based news article. 

* If you're reading a story from a new source you're not familiar with, Google its reliability. There are sites that will check a source's reliability. Also realize that different parts of a large news network can have varying reliability (for example, Fox News actually has fairly reliable news articles, but their talk shows have very little reliability. I'm sure the same could be said for MSNBC). 

* All things considered, /r/neutralPolitics is arguably the best source for getting well informed discussions on political events on Reddit (even though they have pretty strict participation guidelines). 

* Pay attention to world events as much as possible, it's tempting to just tune into national American politics and be done with it but do your best to at least have a cursory understanding of what's happening in China and Iran and Russia. If you ever feel like putting in extra effort, do some research about these countries' backgrounds - understanding the history behind a country helps immensely when understanding the gravity of certain news events.

* Lastly, don't be overwhelmed if you don't understand the significance of certain political events - you'll find that the news tends to sensationalize things and your sense of what is and isn't important, relevant, or accurate will sharpen with time. Don't get trapped in one bubble, whether that bubble is liberal/conservative, high class/low class, educated/uneducated - find and hear perspectives from as many sides as possible, *but also understand that not all sides are equal*. There IS such a thing as objective truth, and it's important to be able to be able to figure out what that truth is, to the best of your ability - but it's also worth understanding the reasons that your cousin Brenda is a die-hard Bernie Sanders supporter, or your Aunt Chloe voted for Trump, even if you come to the conclusion that their reasons for doing so are flawed. Be aware of the political climate and public understanding of events as much as the facts themselves, lest you fall into a trap of thinking that certain things are 'guaranteed' when the majority of middle America isn't concerned about it."
