Sling is just a streaming cable provider. You would just download the app and watch it like the cable box. It’s a good priced service that allows a better ala cart selection compared to the others. I have switched between all of the big streaming cable services, most recently was YouTube TV. Unfortunately the prices have sky rocketed for the streaming cable service and I have cut that out as well. I purchased a Tablo unit for my antenna. This allows me to dvr my antena channels and watch via an app on all of my TVs."
