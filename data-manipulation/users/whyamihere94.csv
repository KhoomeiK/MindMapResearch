wedding,ffdaj2c,t1_ff9aky6,1579816678.0,Agreed. She should redo the trial with the actual products. Part of the service you are paying for is the trial so using “cheaper products” doesn’t cut it.
dogs,ff98b73,t1_ff7m9wu,1579707167.0,Why is the room temperature so low??
AmItheAsshole,ff4g82m,t3_erd4hk,1579562858.0,"NTA. Pets are family members in my country, and you have the right to feel that way regardless of where you live. Plus it’s your house your rules"
dogs,fehrcto,t1_fehlmct,1579122345.0,Thank you for your comment!
dogs,fehr9qm,t1_fehl2r2,1579122297.0,So she went into heat today and the spay is scheduled for February 12th. I asked if we should delay and the vet said it should be fine but after reading your comment (and similar things in internet articles) I’m concerned about doing it that close to the end of the heat. However I don’t want to be “that person” who acts like they know more than the vet. Should I call back and delay it by a week or two?
dogs,fe66gtb,t1_fe4s4bz,1578882860.0,Thank you!
puppy101,fds997o,t3_emvfxy,1578697287.0,Thanks all! I called the vet and they said they do a panel to ensure they are healthy before they go under. Spay is now scheduled — wish us luck!
puppy101,fdqzlzx,t3_emtvn8,1578677457.0,"You bring the puppy in so frequently for all the rounds of vaccines they need, so you probably will get a slight deal by going with their package. The vaccinations they need and these visits have nothing to do with the health testing done on the parents, all new puppies need these vaccines/visits."
dogs,fdngugv,t3_emb8z8,1578585517.0,So sorry for your loss
puppy101,fdisgaz,t1_fdhu4bf,1578450022.0,Do you mind me asking how much the trainer cost just so I can get an idea? I know it will be different in every locale but just for a ballpark
puppy101,fdhvi8i,t1_fdeapi3,1578430897.0,Thank you!

puppy101,fdeaij9,t1_fddmcef,1578334777.0,Can you link to somewhere to buy it pretty please??
dogs,fdc1wtn,t3_ekkklt,1578265480.0,"If you have a nice family lined up, this would be the best thing for your dog and I commend you for getting the dog out of this situation. Will you yourself be able to get away from your dad soon (like when you turn 18)?"
dogs,fcwaq3z,t3_ej93p4,1578021052.0,I’m so sorry for your loss. This is a horrible situation
