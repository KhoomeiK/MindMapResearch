AskReddit,ffpxk59,t3_euft5h,1580109773.0,"I ditched work and accidentally told my boss to suck my balls 

so one time when I was younger I was living in a group home mostly for delinquency and dcf cases and I had a summer job through the program working at a summer camp  for younger troubled kids, one fine monday(I'd go home for weekends and back to the group home in su day nights) I woke up for the first workday of the week hungover and sleep deprived from my weekend adventures and not looking forward to dealing with the campers bullshit that day, and  the staff on shift at the unit took one look at me and said ""bro you look like shiiiiitt you going to work looking like that?"" and I made my decision and told him ""nah I'm goin back to bed man im just saying good morning, *bosses name* can (in my best and loudest eric cartman impression given my state at the time) SUCK MAH BAWZZZ I'll call out and apologise later"" and me and the staff laughed about it for a minute and I went back to bed not thinking anything of it,
when I wake up later i immediately go to the unit basement to watch TV and around 4 one of my coworkers comes up to say hes quitting and ask if i really told *boss* to suck my dick and remembering none of it I said nah where'd you hear that and he shrugged it off and said the whole staff's talking about it and left, I'm sitting here wondering what he meant and a few people mention it to me after throughout the afternoon and then it finally clicks and I realize he meant balls and I go to the staff from before (who was working a double) and I was like ""yo what did you tell my boss i said?!"" n he with a straight face tells me he told her I said suck my balls I'm not coming in today and went to bed"" and started laughing and my younger asshole self started cracking up too and when we'd both laughed it off I went about my evening as usual wondering if id still get paid for the week before

I talked to the lady about it the next day and apologised and she said when the shock wore off she thought it was funny, I didnt even lose the damn job cuz the campers all looked up to me and listened to me"

ight fair enough
a random fact is I play guitar, a quote is I think I'm dumb but maybe just happy (its from dumb by nirvana), and I really dknt know what the best moment of my life is, I've had alot if good moments but I know I don't remember half of them, and I've had alot of really really bad moments, so I guess the best I can give you is the best moment today when I got home and got to relax 
more info is I love music,top three bands are  nirvana, slipknot, n cranford nix
 but basically lots of rock n punk n metal n grunge 
I'm training to be a tattoo artist, and I like reading,getting fucked up and reading book after book was (and still is) one of my favorite hobbies one of my lifetime favorites is the Harry Potter series and I've recently read through part of the girl with the dragon tattoo series, not to mention hundreds of paperbacks I got for fifty cents or so at the pre owned book store that I loved but cant remember 

hit me up if you want,youd be breaking the ignore because I'm a dude trend, but for what it's worth it's true that all guys want one thing, and my one thing  at the moment is to finish typing this and go smoke a cigarette and possibly, with any luck, make a friend 
only catch is you gotta have a decent sense of humor and be straight with profanity because that's at least a quarter of my daily words spoken, of not a third, and also id appreciate acceptance, I dont know you but chances are weve led very different lifestyles, but in any case I'll relate over liking some psychology and the same general spectrum of music and I'll be happy to have an intelligent convorsation about it if you feel like making the leap and responding to somebody after asking people to reach out

SuicideBereavement,fclmwrk,t3_ehtrby,1577751546.0,"just roll with it and breath, smoke a cigarette and drink something cold and listen to music that means something to you emotionally and makes you think, and rest whenever you get the chance. see some close friends and go somewhere even if you dont want to just do something that'll pass the time. dont overthink it just handle what's at hand and you'll feel better soon.

AllNighterArmy,fc23ihm,t3_efoxig,1577338931.0," cool advice but you ain't got insomnia if you're trying not to sleep, you got insomnia if you cant sleep when you try, also caffeine takes time to be broken down and drinks up to five hours before attempting sleep can effect sleep so you should really be drinking your caffeinated whatever before youd normally sleep and then drink another a few hours later, also you said keep occupied twice 


merry Christmas"
