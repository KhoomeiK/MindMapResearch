It really isn't that bad as long as you aren't dumping heat into the battery for a really long time. 

In fact I bet it would be pretty boring to overheat a 9v alkaline with a soldering iron, you won't have the heat to make it explode, maybe a gentle pop as the top comes off.

I'd forgotten some of the details, I really like how I attached the wheels on this second look, it was really simple and easy and has lasted well. Found a plate that matched the hole pattern and size of the wheel mount, bolted them together, and used an extra piece of pvc to fill in the extra space. 

The net in the middle at table-height is great for laying out small items to dry. It's just a cheap walmart laundry bag zip tied around the perimeter.  

Also check out my boot holders, I had trouble getting my boots to dry fully when I just set them over the pipes, and they were always falling. The wire dealies are another cheap walmart toilet paper holder, just like [these](https://www.amazon.com/mDesign-Dispenser-Reserve-Bathroom-Organization/dp/B076KPZW7J/ref=sxin_3_ac_d_pm?ac_md=2-1-QmV0d2VlbiAkMTAgYW5kICQyNQ%3D%3D-ac_d_pm&crid=1AZ8SNN7N3YLT&cv_ct_cx=over+the+tank+toilet+paper+holder&keywords=over+the+tank+toilet+paper+holder&pd_rd_i=B076KPZW7J&pd_rd_r=cc64ff4f-245d-4146-a684-b5da63ac74f6&pd_rd_w=wG2hL&pd_rd_wg=2UkYX&pf_rd_p=b8b03b37-bd30-4468-adff-11c42ccb6582&pf_rd_r=9DD30HW774Q1ZS6P0VDF&psc=1&qid=1579633898&sprefix=over+the+tank+to%2Caps%2C148&sr=1-2-22d05c05-1231-4126-b7c4-3e7a9c0027d0) from Amazon, though I think they were cheaper at walmart. Bent em by hand into a boot holder sort of shape and zip tied them til they stayed.

The ones I put the oak dowels in are the top two bars by the way, I figured since that's where I put the full suits to dry they'd have the largest load. I also did the two pipes so I wouldn't fold the wetsuits as sharply by laying them over two bars. It also allows me to double my capacity by hanging suits over a single bar.

It lives just inside my garage, which makes loading and unloading for diving pretty convenient.

Oh, not pictured is the way I attach my BCDs. For the Hollis solo, which doesn't have buckles to seperate the shoulder straps, I have a few random D rings zip tied onto the rack, and have carabiners constantly on the BCD for various purposes, so they attach to the D-rings on the rack easily. For other BCD's which have shoulder buckles, I unbuckle them and rebuckle them around one of the pipes."

todayilearned,fcj7f2p,t1_fcj6vg7,1577679136.0,"Here's a story about someone who died to a tylenol overdose.
> I have a friend who knew someone who committed suicide by overdosing on Tylenol. By the time she came to her senses and decided she wanted to live, it was too late she had liver failure. She was put on the transplant list, but because she had done the damage to herself intentionally she was basically last on the list.
>

Here's a story about what life is like with liver failure. 
> End stage liver failure is a lot like cancer. You're exhausted by the simplest tasks. You feel like a burden on your family. You're itchy from bile salts building up. I used to lay on the carpet in my bedroom shirtless and push myself around with my legs on it just to get some relief from the itching.
> 
> Often you are jaundiced (yellow, again from bile buildup) and people avoid or are wary of you because you look, well, sick.
> 
> You're in an incredible amount of pain. Stabbing pain, dull pain, deep pain, surface pain. It runs the gamut all at once. I became dependant on dilaudid, huge quantities of it, and I was at the time a 16 year old 85lb girl. I could easily receive 2mg IV every 45 minutes and still be taking to my nurses. Then at home I was on 25mg exalgo (dilaudid extended release) and 8mg every 4-6 hours. That's a metric fuckton of opioids. Thankfully I've been off all of them for nearly 4 years. Some patients never are able to come off them. Thank Christ I was able to, although it did require medical help and suboxone (which I hated and came off on my own)
> 
> I had biliary drains, they're essentially straws in your bile ducts that drain the bile you can't process out of your abdomen into a bag. Kind of like a colostomy but for your liver. A slight tug on them from daily activities hurts like holy hell, because you're tugging on part of your insides.
> 
> In my case, my 'old' liver was cirrhotic and necrotic, so it was literally rotting inside me. It was excruciating. I also had two of the worst comorbidities that unfortunately do not factor into your MELD score. Hepatic encephalopathy and esophageal varices.
> 
> HE is caused when your ammonia levels get so high that your brain is literally soaking in it, and it fucks you up. You can't remember anything for more than a minute ago, you can't stay awake, and can get violent because you have barely any cognition. Usually it signals the end for liver failure patients. Once you drop into a hepatoencephalitic coma you rarely come out. I was lucky to come out without any apparent neurological damage after several HE comas, the longest being 2 weeks.
> 
> The esophageal varices happen when you have portal hypertension, which is high blood pressure in your portal vein, which is caused by liver failure because your liver is 'backing up' like a stopped up sink. This causes a lot of your veins in your body to have higher pressure and they can burst. I referred to them as esophageal hemorrhoids, haha.
> 
> When they burst in your esophagus you bleed into your stomach and then puke massive quantities of blood. My record was 2L at once, that's half my blood volume. Lapsed into that 2 week HE coma after that one. I had to have surgical banding every 2 weeks to keep from bleeding to death. The banding sucked because it caused a weird pain, you know when you swallow air and it hurts your chest? It's that pain for about 2 weeks. So when it finally started to improve, id be having it done again.
> 
> If you're on the transplant list, one really difficult aspect is the waiting. You're waiting for some families worst day so you can have your best one. Waiting for someone to die so you can live. It's a really odd feeling, knowing that your survival depends on someone else losing theirs. I was listed at 17 but didn't get my liver until 19. Many people wait much longer. I know kidney patients who've waited 8 years or more. Unfortunately there's no dialysis for livers, you just die without one.
> 
> Luckily in my case I was too far gone and not high enough on the list, so they decided to attempt a living donor transplant that they believed would fail, but if it failed I'd be moved to the top of the list immediately, as my MELD score would go from 14 to 40. (You need to be in the 30s before they'll consider you) and I'd lost pediatric priority when I turned 18."
