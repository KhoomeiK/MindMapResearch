Catholicism,ff3a6gm,t1_ff33s2y,1579537239.0,"First, Wiki is written by multiple authors.  Sometimes experts, sometimes regular guys.  Any given sentence can be edited multiple times by multiple different people with or without sources—and always with bias.  In short, it’s not a definitive source of information in anything.  It’s a good first source, but don’t base your beliefs on it.  Also, you should know this already.  :)

Second, both statements can be true.  Philomena could have died in the fourth century and he persecutions you are referring to could have also ended in the fourth century.  A hundred years is a long time.

Lastly, carbon dating is not exact.  If can give you a ballpark in terms of dating something, with different degrees of certainty.  For example, she may have died anywhere from 275-325 AD, with a 70% certainty it was sometime between 300-310.  That’s how a carbon date test usually reads.  You’re not going to get an exact date with 100% certainty unless it’s written on the tombstone.

Also lastly, a persecution doesn’t just “end”.  It may formally end by a certain decree from a governor or emperor...but there weren’t Twitter feeds or even newspapers to spread the word.  It would have petered out over time with some pockets of predjudice holding out longer than others. 

If you really want to know the truth, use Wiki only as a starting point.  Then, get off Wikipedia and grab some books or other authoritative sources on a) Philomena and b) the persecution in question and then decide for yourself.

Also, don’t forget, it’s possible that local folk legends don’t align perfectly with historical record.  That doesn’t mean it’s not true (though it could mean that).  Local memory will be more-or-less accurate.  Historical writing from the time (1700 years ago) will be more-or-less accurate.  In the end, we are just stuck with an approximation of what really happened.  There is no way of knowing for sure, unfortunately.  History isn’t like math or physics...but that’s what makes it interesting."
Catholicism,ff2zy4l,t3_erc54c,1579529921.0,"FYI the 300’s is considered the 4th century...

00’s = 1st century 

100’s = 2nd century

200’s = 3rd century

300’s = 4th century

If Philomena died in 304 she died in the 4th century."
Catholicism,fejxrby,t3_epjlfe,1579188265.0,"From what I know, dreams and steeped in symbolism and are most often an expression of your subconscious. Almost everything in your dream is about you.

So start by thinking of it this way:  Your dream was probably not about Brad -- it was about what Brad symbolizes to your subconscious.  Does Brad embody any traits that his appearance in your dream my symbolize?  For example, is he very strict, or a funny guy, or apathetic?  For the sake of example, let's say he is an apathetic nothing-really-matters kind of guy.

Then put it in context.  The light may symbolize revelation, and the book may symbolize knowledge -- or due to the two pages you described, it may symbolize good/evil (though only you can say what they symbolize to you, everyone is different).  Then, your dream *may* be about your subconscious coming to a realization and making a judgement call that apathy is something bad, and from the devil.

It's all just symbols.  The emotion that accompanies it (this time fear) may simply be your conscious mind reacting to this realization, reacting to the symbolism as presented (scary pentagram & screams), or triggered by stresses in real life.

Take with a grain of salt -- I'm not an expert and everyone's mind is different and interprets symbols differently.  That is why ""dream dictionaries"" and such are useless, because different things are coded into symbols differently for each person.

Just know that ""Brad"" in your dream (or any other person) is *probably* code for something else.  This way of thinking has helped me figure out dreams sometimes -- you may have to dwell on it for a while.  Then again, sometimes dreams are complete nonsense, so who knows. :)"

If you want advice -- increase your prayer life.  It is only through communication that we get to know someone and grow closer to them.  Invite God into your everyday life.  Acknowledge His presence in your everyday tasks.

Also, check out ammoseek.com.  You can search for ammo deals and sort by price.  The cheapest slugs I found are 1&3/4” shorties, under various brands. They don’t cycle in my Mossy 500, so i load them one at a time — but they are super fun and only .50 a round or so."

He befriended a local king who asked Magellan to use his impressive ships and cannon to intimidate a local chieftan (Lapu-Lapu), who was a rival of the king.  Turns out Magellan's exploratory vessels weren't equipped for a real battle, but Lapu-Lapu was.  It was a massacre and Magellan himself was beheaded.
