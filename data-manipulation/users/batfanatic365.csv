SuicideWatch,fefmhfn,t3_eowjr3,1579059515.0,"I am struggling with some of the same thoughts, so I may not know everything but I can tell you what has been helping me. It's ok that you don't know what's special about you yet or that you haven't found your talent, you don't have to know all that. I may not know what's special about you but I can tell you that if you keep fighting through this, life will get better. You gotta reach out and find people who care about you and wan to help you. These people don't have to be professionals, they can be a trusted adult or a close friend. You may feel like life is pointless but you have a purpose and I believe that you will find whats special about you. I truly do care about you and I hope this helps you out."
SuicideWatch,fefkllq,t3_eokb1t,1579058312.0,"This isn't true at all, many people care about you. Just reach out and good people will help you, I promise. I don't know your life story or how old you are but I do know this, life is worth it. Even if you are struggling right now, you just have to fight through the pain and it will be worth it in the end. Please don't leave this earth I may not know you but I care about you, and so do most of the others do as well. So please reach out to someone, get some help, the help doesn't even have to be professional. It could just be a trusted adult or a close friend. But please, I beg you, reach out to someone."
