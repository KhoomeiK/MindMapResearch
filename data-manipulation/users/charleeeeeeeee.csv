NonBinaryTalk,ffekme7,t3_esvht2,1579851989.0,"honestly it doesnt matter. your clothes are your clothes regardless of social views. my one thing for trans and non binary people is that you gotta genuinely have dysphoria in order to call yourself such. however as much or as little dysphoria its probably the most important factor in all this. id say if you experience or have experienced this then it doesnt matter what you wear, just listen to yourself and try to block any third parties trying to comment on your clothes. i believe in you, go get yourself some ice cream you deserve it :p"
