tippytaps,fex2ff9,t1_fewd4hv,1579423202.0,"I was responding with regard to your statement about genetically engineered pets. I love cats and can only have one at a time due to allergies. I lost a dear little friend a year and a half ago after 13 years. Around 3 months after he died I adopted a rescue who is the sweetest goofball. I wouldn’t have him in my life had my other cat not lived a ‘normal’ lifespan, and my current buddy was going to be taken to a shelter when I found the post about him on a neighborhood app site, so who knows what would have happened to him. And beyond that, knowing that my current friend will be with me (if we’re both lucky) for what should be 15 years or so (he’s young) makes each day especially valued. I still wish my other cat didn’t die and I miss him terribly, but I had no control over what we now know as the natural (unaltered) cycle of life. But he did die and now I have a new chapter with a new friend. One is not better or more important than the other, they just are."

AbruptChaos,fd2d98l,t1_fd2aoa4,1578145543.0,My understanding by following the thread was that it was you (getting down votes for your ‘hop the curb’ questioning/responses).

AbruptChaos,fd251kr,t1_fd23jn4,1578141789.0,I think some forget this is effectively a worldwide forum and not all terms or expressions are commonly known. Someone perceived as clueless may simply just not know the expression.
CatastrophicFailure,fck84f5,t1_fck744k,1577719204.0,We’re talking about whether they had time to clear things out before it was found or determined to be unsafe to enter. Prohibiting entry was likely some time before they set up the cameras to film.
Cringetopia,fcjxbt1,t1_fcjw5gg,1577709139.0,I got that reference.
CatastrophicFailure,fcjr0s4,t1_fcjli92,1577700279.0,With any luck maybe they knew it was compromised well enough ahead of time to clear things out.

WatchPeopleDieInside,fc9j8ao,t1_fc9boov,1577553465.0,"That was actually my favorite part, what with that wink. I also figured it served a purpose, with the farmer holding the scythe - otherwise the image on the screen would stand alone and be more like a camera trick.

Edit: I see I repeated u/Sexy_Australian’s point - I honestly didn’t see it, didn’t mean to show any disregard."
HumansBeingBros,fc8oc21,t1_fc8jo6h,1577538990.0,The ones I know do. I have a couple colleagues who are evangelical. Their pastors are politically motivated and this is one of their points. They categorize it under “the ends justify the means.” One colleague effectively referred to Trump as a useful idiot.

80smusic,fc6n0rv,t1_fc5obn0,1577484449.0,"It was such a different time then - I know because I lived it. Music didn’t get into the popular culture so quickly as it does now. It would take time for songs to get airplay and catch on across the country. Sure if it was a big act their music would catch on quicker, but for the most part it was a long time for music to make its way into popular play and shared public awareness, so this album is most certainly 80s music."
