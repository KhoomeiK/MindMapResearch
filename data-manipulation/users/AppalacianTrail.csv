She’s also fussy asf when it comes to food. Like the food she’s been eating she will turn her nose up the next week. 
But it’s when I go to give her a little bit of milk, or raw meat that all my other cats have enjoyed, or chicken or literally anything else a normal cat will eat. She will just turn her nose up at it. Refuse to eat anything else even near it. She has a bowl for nuts and a bowl for wet food. 
But if we get KFC. That cat will fight you for the chicken skin. Not the chicken. Just the skin. And only while it’s warm. 
She goes ultimate fighter on everyone until she has claimed all the chicken skin possible. 

And then she looks me in the eyes while she pukes on my carpet."
