changemyview,ffj2tne,t3_etwbv6,1579988972.0,"Your premise is fundamentally flawed. You use logical fallacies in an attempt to rationalize a feeling and are disregarding the proper logic to attain the answer. For example you started the post with Violence is ok. You said rape is a type of violence and therefore fits into the same mold. Aside from the transitive property not being properly applied, you fail to account for additional variations on each item discussed. There’s a certain level of “weight” if you will associated with different acts. Of course these weighting’s are subjective and often dynamic but, using real life as an example, there are multiple times where hardened lifelong violent criminals live in prison with other similar to them. Yet often times, a serial child molester will be harmed or killed by those same criminals. There’s a line in the sand that differentiates the degree to which an act is to be considered heinous by the group. You may not AGREE with the line, but that doesn’t inherently prevent it from existing on the whole.

As mentioned earlier, murder and violence (combat) are included in the mechanics of the game. They have different rules around them and there’s a built in cause and effect. Morally right or morally wrong, murder is a means to an end and presents a form and foundation from which story telling can be built around. Rape on the other hand is not that. There are inherently no rules regarding the mechanics of how would play out in game and it serves no realistically progressional purpose to the story other than to serve the interests of the incel DnD player who thought of as a way to live vicariously. There is quite literally zero reason for it to exist. Couple that with the ability to disassociate and you have your answer from a story telling perspective. A lot of people can morally rationalize violence and murder if the situation deems those actions necessary like “this guy lied and got my healer killed so he too will die” or things in the real world like “break into my house and get shot” but no sane person will be able to rationalize rape with a similar anecdotal hypothetical which would allow for the disassociation."

explainlikeimfive,ffarboz,t1_ffa923k,1579742675.0,Yeah is the same thing that requires the surface interval I discussed above but since you’re flying at a higher altitude there’s considerably less pressure (even with a pressurized cabin) so there’s still inherent risk invoked.
explainlikeimfive,ffa8llc,t1_ffa337a,1579729999.0,"Kinda sorta. What happens is when you breathe the nitrogen it’s absorbed into your tissue which, at sea level pressure it’s not a problem because it escapes as fast or faster than it’s absorbed (1 atmosphere is one of the units you can use). Every 10 meters of depth that pressure is increased by 1 atmosphere. So at 30ft or 10m underwater there’s double the pressure. At 20m triple (3 atmosphere) so on and so forth. The problem is that while you don’t really feel this pressure in a physical sense (you equalize as you descend) it’s pushing against your tissue and making it difficult for the nitrogen your tissue is absorbing to leave your tissue. When you get down to 100 feet or below (different for everyone) the pressure is great enough that it causes the body to retain so much nitrogen you start to get a drunk feeling (narcosis).

When you begin to ascend back toward the surface, the resistance this gas has start to diminish so it exits your body. If you ascend too quickly, the nitrogen leaves your system at a very rapid pace which, as you said, causes many many issues such as Decompression Illness (DCI/The Bends). In order to avoid that, you ascend slowly and in a controlled manner as well as spend a few minutes at around 5m 15ft doing a “safety stop” to ensure your off-gasing properly and to allow a sort of buffer for, well for safety lol.

Subsequently, this is one of the main areas where dive computers are handy (and also a crutch to many who don’t know or practice the manual way). Once the dive is complete, there will be residual albeit acceptable levels of nitrogen in your tissue. This is where a surface interval comes into play which is just a break in between dives. Instead of memorizing numbers and having dive tables to plan a dive and surface interval required by safety standards, computers track everything for you using algorithms to handle the computing so as you go down it know how far down and for how long you’re at those depths. Go far enough and it will tell you to do additional safety stops along the way back to the surface. It will time them for you and yell at you if you start ascending too fast for what’s considered safe. And on a final point this is related to something called nitrox or EANx (enhances air nitrox) which is an alteration of the percentage of oxygen and nitrogen present in the mixture that’s different from standard breathing air and standard air tanks. It actually adds MORE oxygen at less nitrogen which doesn’t do too much but is useful for multiple dives with little surface interval such as an instructor with multiple dives throughout the day since less nitrogen is being breathed, less is absorbed and less needs to dissipate at the surface to make it safe to go in again so the surface intervals can be shorter. However because this adds oxygen, as already mentioned by others and contrary to a lot of people’s beliefs, it actually means you can’t go as deep because oxygen toxicity becomes more of a concern. So with depth you either have nitrogen absorption being an issue or oxygen toxicity being an issue (the latter more serious but both deadly). That’s why deep divers and more technically proficient “tech” divers use other mixes including those with helium and even rebreathers but those are well beyond the scope of this comment which is well beyond the scope of the question as it is.

The air in a standard diving tank matches (or closely matches) that which we breathe on the surface. When your breathe Nitrogen but the pressure underwater stops it from leaving your body tissue, you can develop nitrogen narcosis (getting 'narced') which impedes reaction time and decision making. Breathing in too pure of oxygen though can cause its own issues, often worse than too much nitrogen.

You could probably save a lot by selling the cars and paying cash for something pretty cheap with a secondary effect of the car insurance getting cheaper as well. Are you financing the phones? I would consider speaking to the provider and seeing what kind of other plans you can move into without any penalties or fees. Also look into other spending habits that might exist and small monthly bills that add up like cloud storage, Netflix, Hulu, and consider cutting those.

You seem pretty fired up but appear to miss the point..."
YouShouldKnow,ff6p7xi,t3_eqorwv,1579632000.0,"Treat every weapon as if were loaded.

Never point your weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot.

Keep your finger straight and off the trigger until you are ready to fire.

Keep the weapon on safe until you intend to fire.

tipofmytongue,ff6k4ka,t3_erxqxq,1579628912.0,Sounds like some of the things Steam Powered Giraffe sing about though I am not familiar enough with the band nor a song that I can recall which would fit your description.
explainlikeimfive,ff6i2o7,t1_ff6h83c,1579627663.0,"Respect for the acknowledgement. In all seriousness, I am actually following this because I had other questions similar such as how public utilities (plows etc.) go about getting the region to a functional state when the snow is taller than some of the plows and I am hoping to have them answered here haha!"
AskHistorians,ff6hv9q,t1_ff6autt,1579627536.0,"So on a quick side note, the term over and out does have very niche uses. For example I would use it when issuing commands or direction over the radio in which an immediate response to the conversation wasn't warranted because there was additional work to follow in order to execute the command but that I expected feedback. This, however was taught to me through leadership and something I picked up on and adopted and I can't recall it being something formally taught. I can however also confirm that this was irrespective of unit or group as at least a few were using the same methodology at each unit I PCSed to."
ChoosingBeggars,ff6gj40,t1_ff6aioq,1579626712.0,"I guess our experiences are different. I worked multiple retail as well as customer support roles and in both of them I have personally seen and used almost the exact term you listed: ""excuse me, sir but you can’t do that"". I don't understand why it is so challenging to think that people can be polite regardless of age, especially in a role that predicates such behavior. Perhaps the reason you have never had someone request something for less for or free simply on the premise of existing as the customer is because your experience is largely management and by the time a petty issue worked its way from the cashiers/retailers its no longer a point in which the patron argues. I very VERY frequently get the ""I'm going to pay you less and you have to accept it because I am the customer"" routine online through my different reselling outlets. My wife worked at subway during college and frequently got the customer is always right give me a handout out, though, to be fair it was usually reliant on the idea that they were a loyal ""regular"" and deserved special treatment but both occurred with relative frequency.

You over generalizations seem to reinforce the earlier point you've made regarding always having more room for worldly exposure."

ChoosingBeggars,ff66qat,t1_ff641y1,1579620455.0,I also question the validity of it however not for your reasoning. You really should expand your exposure to the world a little bit.
