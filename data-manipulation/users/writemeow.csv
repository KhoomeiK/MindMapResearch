 the thing that really bothers me, it would have been so easy, (the disarmament agreement) and it's not (now that we have allowed these nations to progress as far as they have progressed in regards to nuclear weapon and power production)


-as important as these lives are(the prisoners/hostages) nuclear is so powerful.(meaning more important than the prisoners) 

My uncle (an MIT scientist/professor or whatever he was) explained that to me, many, many years ago, the power,(of nuclear power and weapons) and that was 35 years ago,(nuclear weapon/ballistic technology has progressed a lot in 35 years, meaning nuclear weapons are more dangerous now than they were before) 

he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right. (Likely discussing the effects of proliferation because of ability to harness nuclear power, as well as stabilization of regions as more nations develop a nuclear deterrent)

Who would have thought? (Stating that no one is dumb for not seeing this coming because it's not really in many peoples daily concerns)

 But when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners - now it used to be three, now it's four -  but when it was three, and even now, I would have said(the situation was bad before but now it is worse)

 It's all in the messenger, fellas. And it is, fellas, because, you know,(it is largely in how to speak to them and how you deal with them) 

 they don't, they haven't figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it's going to take them about another 150 years(they are socially behind and have yet to realize what untapped resources they have in using their entire population)

I don't doubt you'll read my interpretation of what he said and tell me I'm giving him too much credit, I'm biased, I'm projecting hopeful ideas onto his incoherence, among other negative and condescending statements. 

That said, no nuclear tests in years from North Korea, and he successfully forced iran to fire their weapons in the dirt to avoid a confrontation.
