AmItheAsshole,fepiz22,t1_fenl596,1579321714.0,"Tbh, telling OP to talk to HR seems like really bad advice. I feel like everyone forgets that HR’s main purpose is to protect the company’s bottom line.

Realistically, you’d have to twist a lot of arms to get HR to side with an employee and that’s IF you manage not to get fired. If HR/upper management begins to sense that OP’s reporting of their overly emotional coworkers is going to cause further problems down the line, OP’s going to have a target on their head and someone might unfortunately aim for said target. 

OP, I’d suggest getting out ASAP. If your coworkers have been at your company since the 90s and they behave like this, it’s time to dip for your career’s and mental health’s sake. You are definitely NTA here."

AmItheAsshole,feg1iwb,t3_eos8wj,1579072928.0,"NTA. Now is as good a time as any to learn that there are consequences for breaking the rules.

When I was 7 and broke any rules of the house, I’d be put in a timeout, be grounded and/or have privileges temporarily taken away, depending on the severity of my rule breaking.

You know what that’s taught me as an adult? That there are consequences to all of my actions, both big and small, both good and bad.

I’d also suggest showing the responses here to the so-called “adults” in your family. It’s apparent that they are only taking your cousin’s side solely due to her age without looking at the situation more deeply. Their reinforcing of her bad behavior can lead to more serious behavioral problems in the future.

My suggestion to them is to curb your cousin’s bad behavior now or risk having her grow up to be a spoiled brat."

Emma, if you are reading this, GIRL GET OUT. This type of controlling behavior leaves way too much room for your relationship with OP to spiral into an abusive relationship. I’ve both been in one and seen friends go through something similar to be able to recognize the early signs. I repeat, GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN. It’s not too late!"
AmItheAsshole,feg0h9a,t3_eos6j1,1579071707.0,"YTA and a major one at that. Regardless of age, relationship, whatever, you RESPECT someone’s privacy. Going through their things is NOT respectful. 

Your intentions, good or bad, don’t matter at all in this. The fact remains that you violated her privacy and then used the information that you were NOT privy to, to your advantage. 

Shame on you, OP. Shame on you. There is a reason why the saying “the road to hell is paved with good intentions” exists."

AmItheAsshole,fdyywpm,t3_emtsuc,1578784956.0,You’re NTA. The men harassing you are major AHs. I’d also venture into saying your friend is also an AH given that her reaction is to call you an AH when all you were trying to do was not get harassed.

I made the last one quit her nursing job a few years in and made her have a string of lovers (despite being married lol) until she got some disease or something.

BitLifeApp,fdrbmdj,t1_fdr2ir8,1578682125.0,"Lol I just surrender. I always make sure to give it to my youngest daughter so she can be a rich kid and then grow up to become a rich adult. Then I make sure she has daughters so I can repeat the cycle again. The longest I’ve kept this going was 15 generations. 

It sounds a bit creepy/ritualistic now that I think about it."
exchristian,fdmmlwj,t1_fdm2a6b,1578555743.0,"This. I was in this boat when I lost one of my closest mentors, my youth pastor, in high school. I was sold on, and eventually bought into, the idea that I’d one day see him again. Oddly enough, as much as I bought into this idea, it made me all the more miserable, like why do I have to wait to see someone when I wanted and needed to see them again now?

I think getting into the whole “you’ll see them again” mindset puts you in an increasingly permanent state of mourning and as time passes, it becomes harder to break from that cycle. It becomes that much more difficult to truly process what happened, acknowledge any and all emotions you have felt and currently feel, and move on. 

Ironically, it’s easier now knowing that I won’t see my youth pastor again. It makes all the memories I shared with him all the more precious and the wisdom he passed on to me that much more valuable. I still miss him and I still think about him from time to time, but I do so with a smile instead of tears."
