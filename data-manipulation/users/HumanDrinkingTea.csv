college,ffpg8xx,t1_ffpe96n,1580094292.0,"Is this any particular reason you feel a need or desire to go back to school? It seems you have a job (not that I have any idea of what the type of job you have pays). Why not find a hobby to indulge in and lose yourself in?

Also, if you struggle with math, there's no reason to feel tied to STEM. I have no idea what you like or what your goals are, but your interests and goals are usually a good place to start. Going to school in when you're 25+ is very different than going to school when you're a traditional student. Assuming your username is giving away your birth year, I'm 8 years younger than you, and even I feel that this time around school is *very* different than the first time around. Typical undergrads haven't ""done"" adult life yet. We have. You've been an adult for a while, and this gives you a different perspective.

This is to say that maybe traditional career assessments aren't the best, if they're geared towards younger people. They don't know themselves, and maybe you don't *think* you know yourself, but chances are you know yourself better than you realize. Maybe you just have to come to terms with who that ""self"" is. 

I mean, I could be totally off, since I'm mostly projecting, as I had to really ""find myself"" to figure out what direction to go in. And I realized that it very much *was* about ""finding myself."" And in hindsight I feel that in the end, it was about admitting to myself that I was a the person that I was, because I had been denying it for so long. 

I don't think you're a downer-- I think you're just trying to figure things out. My advice is to listen to your gut. I'm also single and childless, and not being tied down, fortunately, allows for a certain level of freedom. What does your gut say? Is there any sort of path that you're hesitant about, but that you feel a pull towards? Or are you completely lost? If it's the latter, I'd reiterate the idea of finding a hobby. Hobbies are less stressful than school, and they can help you learn about yourself and about new things. I discovered I had an interest in biology after I got into exercise and healthy eating. I found biological process of how these activities affected the body to be fascinating. I never would have realized it was so interesting, though, were it not for getting into health and fitness. 

Not being great at math is not the end of the world. I am lucky in that I am a math nerd in every way possible, and that brings me some ""easy"" career options, but I know many, many people who create good careers for themselves that make them happy without using any math at all. 

Also, I wouldn't worry much about age. While it is a thing that might bother some people, so is anything else that cause people to discriminate, but there's usually enough people that don't discriminate that you can find a way to make it in this world."
college,ffpdqbl,t3_euguma,1580092489.0,"> Half of it can't even be found explicitly demonstrated in the textbook.

I studied music education and I currently study math, so I have a pretty good idea of how education courses go and of how math classes go, but not of how math education courses go.

What is the purpose of the class? Is it a math class? Teacher education classes and math classes tend to have different goals, and what the professor wants you to get out of the class is important.

In my experience, in math classes, it's common for professors to give homework problems that are much tougher than those that are explicitly spelled out. This is because they want to make sure you understand the concepts behind what you learned and aren't just regurgitating the material. Just 5 minutes ago (in between all my redditing, lol) I was completing a homework problem that was nothing like anything I had ever seen in class. However, once I broke it down into it's pieces and could describe/define every element that was being asked for, the approach to solving the problem became apparent, and that's because I had a non-superficial understanding of what was discussed in class. It took some time and effort to think through, but that's the entire point.

Again, this is common in math classes, but if this is *also* a teacher education class, I would think that he'd be explaining his reasoning to you. All the professors in my teacher education classes would explain the pedagogical reasoning behind their approaches to teaching, and I'm concerned that he isn't, although it's possible he's not aware that this level of challenge is unusual for the students in his class. Are you a math major? Is your professor used to teaching math majors? Again, my experience is that ""challenge"" problems in homework are pretty normal for math majors, so it might not cross his mind that it needs explaining (even though he really *should* explain it if it's a teacher ed class).

Still, I'm interested in learning more about this class. The nature of this class is important in helping us understand what is going on. 

Still, as a future teacher, you should consider the idea that not all content *should* be explicitly demontrated. Fostering critical thinking skills is important, and this is done by allowing students opportunities to take on challenges that are a bit above the level that they are used to.

Of course, this is tough to do in practice because every student is at a different level, so it's hard to gauge the appropriate types of challenges to give. This is where differentiated instruction comes in-- as a teacher you can give more advanced students challenge problems while giving problems with more explicit steps presented to the weaker students (assuming k-12 and not college level). 

You also run into the problem, sometimes, where students who aren't used to being challenged push back a bit. This happens a lot among high achieving students who haven't seen much failure in their life-- they become afraid of failure and then are afraid of challenges so that hard problems make them an emotional wreck. Recently, this phenomenon has become ubiquitous as A's have become expected rather than a sign of extraordinary performance. I'd also reflect to consider if this might be the position you're in right now. What *is* so bad about tough questions that don't have the explicit process spelled out for you? Is there nothing you can learn from the process of working through figuring out how to solve them? 

Again, I can't say much more about specifics because I don't know the nature of the class or what it covers, but as I said earlier, this is pretty par for the course for math classes. Teacher ed classes should have you reflecting on it and the pedagogical techniques, as well."
college,ffpb3un,t1_ffp9vph,1580090641.0,"> I've been failing/repeating basic math courses for nearly 20 years.

Have you ever been tested for learning disabilities? Bad memory and struggling with math are definitely indicators that there could be an issue. Some people struggle with dyscalculia, which some people refer to as ""dyslexia for math,"" but it basically means that your intuition for numbers and quantities isn't there. Memory problems, on the other hand, could be indicative of about a million different issues (I have memory problems due to neurological issues I had in the past). 

I hear that the technology sector is pretty bad with age discrimination, which I think has to do with how fast technology is evolving. Other areas, though, I don't think have quite as much age discrimination. I'm getting into statistics (research), and I think my age is an advantage, if anything. Different career paths have different cultures. Age will be an asset in some but a target for discrimination in others. 

I have nothing against history majors, as long as they don't act like jerks to me because I can't remember an event or a date. Otherwise I'm happy for them if they're happy with their major. My sister did have trouble finding a job, though-- it's a tough market. She ended up becoming a librarian and seems happy.

college,ffpa6ix,t1_ffp8inf,1580089995.0,"Okay, this helps. For what it's worth, I was also a '91 baby who graduated in '09. Not that it's relevant, but I saw you're username and wondered if you were my age and this post confirmed it. 

Do you plan on getting a PhD? My understanding is that psychology careers typically require a PhD. If so, then I'd say transfer sooner rather than later, and work on getting as much research experience with professors as you can while at your 4-year school. You can even start reaching out to professors now for research opportunities-- some are willing to take CC students while others prefer to only take students from their own school. Research experience is something that grad school admissions typically look for, which is why I recommend it. Community colleges don't have research-focused professors, which is why you'll want to be at a 4-year school."
college,ffp99w6,t3_eugkjn,1580089368.0,"> TL;DR: I guess my question is: If I end up getting a masters in music, can I go back at some point and get a degree in german linguistics? or computer science? have any of y'all done it?

Yes to all of the above. I have an undergrad degree in music, and will be getting a graduate degree in statistics. 

Right now, focus on making sure you have a plan for keeping yourself financially stable enough that you *can* fund another degree in the future. It takes significant investment both in time and money.

That being said, you can definitely do it. 

Don't get a second undergrad. Take all the necessary prerequisites for a masters as a non-matriculated student and then get a master's. 

That being said, the only degrees worth getting an undergrad degree for are computer science and engineering, because these are very valuable undergrad degrees that have very specific coursework that allows for high paying entry level just with just a BS. In statistics entry level is with a master's, so jumping straight into a masters as soon as possible was the obvious better choice for me. You may want to look deeper into an 2nd undergrad for CS, but definitely consider taking just prerequisites and then getting a master's.

I am much like you, but my life choices became much easier to make when I burned out on music. You still have the fire pushing you into music, so I'd stay stick with it. I've been playing my instrument for 20 years, and although I no longer do it professionally, I don't regret a minute of it. I still play in the privacy of my own home, and sometimes I amaze myself with what I can do as a result of years of hard work, even though I no longer put the time into it that I used to. 

Still, make sure you have a game plan for those finances. As long as you can afford school, you can make it happen. Until you decide you're ""done"" being a musician (which may or may not happen), keep teaching yourself things on the side so that you can pull out those skills when the time is right. Obviously you will be too busy at times to study, but when you get some free moments, don't hesitate to dig in. It pays off more often than you'd think.

What you'll find when you're older and self-taught is that you'll be *miles* ahead of the typical undergrad. Most undergrads are not used to teaching themselves anything, and are passive learners. I myself am self-taught at programming and I thought I'd be behind, but I ended up being just as good if not stronger than a lot of undergrads with a formal education. If you keep up what you're doing, you'll end up in a good position.

You should know that in my path of changing careers, I have met *many* musicians who have done the same. Most are wildly successful. Very few people build the work ethic that formally trained professional classical musicians build, and that work ethic pays off. I find that yes, STEM degrees as a whole are ""harder"" than music degrees, but (with the exception of pre-meds) STEM majors can't even compete with the intensity with which musicians approach their craft. It is perhaps no coincidence that I've known a good number of musicians who have gone on to medical school.

As long as you approach anything you do the same focus with which you approach violin, you'll be able to make it work.

For what it's worth, I've talked to a number of professors and people on admissions at grad schools, and they've had nothing but good things to say about musicians who have switched into their programs. There's a certain ""type"" of person who does what you want to do and what I have done, and this is a ""type"" of person who tends to be quite successful."
college,ffp7o08,t1_ffp6inw,1580088281.0,"As someone who has strong logical reasoning skills but a horrible memory, I've found that a math major is a really good fit for me. This is because just about everything you learn in math can be derived from scratch if your logic skills are good enough. The students who got by in math classes just by memorizing eventually hit a wall, but those of us who gave up on memorizing a long time ago tend to do pretty well in the long run because we're used to figuring it out as we go, and at the higher levels this is more or less what professors expect you to do. 

My sister was a history major. Now *that* is a nightmare. She used to make fun of me for how I can't remember *anything* history related. Joke's on her because I'm going to have a more employable degree *and* I can google everything she asks me."

You need to have barely any credentials at all to become a tutor. Some are amazing, of course, but some are... questionable. 

> I never understood how some people cant comprehend that there are others who will do things at different speeds and different ways. And that just because they do things differently, doesn't mean their way is ""less than"".

Honestly, I think people tend to be caught up in their own worlds and don't bother to *think*. I'm pretty judgmental of teachers, because I went to teacher school and I used to be a teacher. ""Different people are different"" is like day 1 of teacher school. It's basic fact of life that you wouldn't think would need to be said, but some people can't figure it out on their own.

Why can't they figure it out? Because I guess they're different than us and need help figuring it out, lol. I laugh, but really it's the truth. A lot of people don't spend a ton of time reflecting on what it's like to be a student who struggles, so you just kind of have to force-feed some empathy to them."
findapath,ffosg5t,t1_ffm9u5q,1580081112.0,">  I've been reading an awful lot about AI lately, but I couldn't do any job relating to computer programming cause I have literally no skills or knowledge or background in that.

I have a music degree, and I felt much like you-- I was burned out and needed a break from music. 

I used to have no skills or knowledge or background in AI... until I did. 

My path was tough for me to figure out, but for what it's worth I started in your position a few years ago and now I'm on track to apply to PhD programs in statistics, hopefully within the next year or so. And yes, in the process, I managed to get *paid* experience working with machine learning (it was a summer research experience with a professor). I had no experience in machine learning prior to then. 

Yes, I had to take the financial hit and go back to school. I had been teaching private lessons since I was 18, so by the time I graduated college a had a enough income coming from it that by living with my parents I could save enough that I could quit my job and go back to school. Obviously, you'll have to figure out how to make your finances work, but teaching private lessons is always a viable option when you're a musician. This is something that's pretty easy to work around a school schedule if you plan on going back to school.

Community college is amazing. And by amazing, I mean cheap. I was able to get my research experience *while* I was still in community college because there was a university nearby with professors who were willing to work with non-traditional students. Not all professors are willing to work with non-traditional students or with students with a relatively weak background, but some are, and I was lucky enough to find one. By then, I had already taken and done well in several classes, and I had professors who could put in a good word for me.

I have also never taken a CS class. I taught myself programming. I recommend [CS50 on edx.org](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) to start. This is what I started with, and quite honestly it was *way* better than what my community college offered (although my community college had an unusually bad CS program, unfortunately). From there I started solving problems with [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Surprisingly, this and my community college coursework was enough to convince a professor to take me on for summer research.

That's what it took to get my foot in the door. I'm heading in an academic path and hope to get a PhD in statistics. I don't plan on getting into the AI field, but if you're interested in it, consider starting by learning programming in your free time and dusting off your math skills from years ago (khan academy is a good resource) because you'll want to at the very least learn some linear algebra at some point, and if you go back to school, it's best to be prepared to ace the placement tests in math so that you don't waste time and money. All that's to start-- it will take time, so during that time, you should be thinking about what piques you're interests. I thought at one point that I'd be interested in AI, but over time I realized that I was interested in a more ""traditional"" math education and that I want to be involved in research (outside of AI). That being said, I absolutely would not have gotten here if I didn't say ""Hey, why don't I start learning a bunch of skills that could get me into AI?""

college,ffojiwo,t1_ffof8bf,1580078346.0,"> So in the faculties eyes, you're just lazy and not using your potential.

Yep. I'll be honest-- I hate it the term ""lazy."" I feel like it's a cop-out. It doesn't actually *say* anything about a person, other than that they're not doing all the things that are expected of them. It says nothing about *why* the person isn't doing what's expected of them. It's also a word that comes with the implication that it can easily be fixed. I've met many people who call themselves ""lazy,"" but I rarely meet a person who says they *want* to ""lazy,"" and I'm pretty sure people who say that they ""want"" to be lazy are lying to themselves. These are individuals that always seem severely depressed and clearly hate living, and the ""want"" they have towards being lazy always seems to be a desire to just avoid life (whatever ""life"" is). All the non-depressed ""lazy"" people I've met always want to do better, but they can't figure out how. This is clearly not a problem of just ""laziness,"" then, because ""laziness"" implies that a person is choosing to shirk their duties. 

I think people are quick to judge because of a [typical mind fallacy](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Typical_mind_fallacy)-- the tendency to assume that other minds work like one's own mind does. This is the fallacy that happens when someone thinks that because they found something easy, everyone else will find it easy, too. Someone who falls into this trap will be quick to label others as ""lazy,"" since they don't comprehend that people who are different from themselves might be truly struggling to get things done."

What you say is truth, though, and it's pretty shitty. I think people need to be more aware of it. People assume that their ""normal"" is everyone's normal. It's like when a man doesn't think sexism exists because he doesn't see it or a white person doesn't think racism exists because he/she doesn't see it. It's pretty hard to see things that aren't happening in your own inner bubble. Before I had any problems, I thought that all teachers were nice and that students were just being whiny when they said teachers were mean. It took actually experiencing it to realize that teachers *are* jerks, but only to *some* students. 

Now I'm more mindful of it, but like with all types of discrimination, people who aren't the recipients underestimate it's prevalence and its impact. 

It's a real issue, and I wish it was something we talked about in teacher school. We talked about racism and sexism and classism and we talked about *how* to teach low-performing students and *how* to teach students with disabilities, but I remember no talk at all about discrimination against weaker students. 

Another thing I wish they talked about more in teacher school is implicit bias-- there's so much talk about how society shits on disadvantaged populations, but there was no talk that I can remember about how people who don't *intend* to contribute to the problems often contribute to the problems due to biases that of their own that they are not mindful of. For example, one bias that I noticed that I had when I was teaching that I had to be mindful about was the tendency to treat students who hit puberty early with the expectations that were appropriate for the age they *looked* rather than they age they were. When a 10 year old looks like they're 14 (very different ages with different expectations), you sometimes have to work hard to remember that they're still much younger and need to be treated as if they're younger. On the flip side, the kids who hit puberty late shouldn't be let off easy just because they look like a child.

But yes, you are absolutely correct. Society is messed up like that. Human brains like to take shortcuts and like to stereotype people instead of actually getting to know them as individuals, so we have to actively contradict our brains' natural impulses if we want to be fair and just people."

I wanted to be a teacher, because I thought I could make a difference, and I hope that I did for the students I taught, but it is not the career for me. I only hope that the good teachers out there are strong enough to stay in the profession and to be the people that your teachers weren't.

> But I'll never be able to shake those many many years of having my confidence broken down. I'll probably forever struggle with learned helplessness and a inferiority complex.

I feel the same way. I work hard and am doing well, but I feel as if it could all tumble down at any given moment. The thing with what I'm studying, too, is that you get to be around tons of people who have PhD's in math from Ivy League schools and it's damn near impossible to not be intimidated. The point is that no matter how smart you are, it's easy to feel inferior, because there will always be people better than you. 

The reality, though, is that all these people are just people, who are no better or worse than you or me or anyone else.

I was at a conference where graduate programs had set up tables to try to recruit students. I was walking around, and I saw I giant crowd around one table. When I got closer, I saw that it was the table representing Princeton University. After the crowd cleared, I went up to the guy representing the school and asked him ""How do you get over the sense that you're not good enough to apply to such a prestigious school?""

He then started telling me about how every professor who comes in to *work* at the school feels that they aren't ""good enough"" to be there. And it hit me. The best and the brightest in the world-- the professors and researchers of Princeton-- feel that they aren't ""good"" enough. 

Obviously they are ""good enough."" But the feeling never disappears. It's because at the end of the day, we are all human and we are all flawed. Some may be smarter than others, but no one is really the mythical ""genius"" that we create in our minds. We all struggle and work to get from one day to the next, but each in our own ways. No one is free from the struggles of being human."
college,ffno97d,t1_ffnbvpq,1580068469.0,"I was thinking just yesterday about how sad I was that no one really ""gets"" it. My situation was very extreme, in a way that's isolating, because so few people know what it's like to see both worlds, especially to the extent that I have.

I'll give you some context about the ""worlds"" I've lived in and how jarring the differences are. Up until about age 15 or 16, I was great at all subjects, especially math. I was a top student in non-STEM areas, too, but I wasn't particularly extraordinary at it. Although I didn't realize it then, I've realized in hindsight that *was* extraordinary in math. I received a 99th percentile every single year on the math section on standardized tests, and when I took the SAT in the 7th and 8th grades (for gifted placement) I scored around the 99.9th percentile compared to other students my age (which I think was around the 90th percentile compared to high school seniors, but I'm not entirely sure-- I'd have to dig up the data). By the end of my freshman year of high school I was on track to become valedictorian. I don't think there was a single person in my grade who could even compete with my math skills.

Medically, I'm not sure what happened. I've been diagnosed with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, anxiety, and a whole slew of mental illnesses. At some point in college I was told I had psychosis. Honestly, I can't really process it or talk about it-- it was just a *bad* time. I really couldn't function, at all. I remember the look of surprise on my psychiatrist's face when she found out I had a job-- it was a look of disbelief because she could not fathom that I could manage to work. And to be honest, I *was* barely managing. I thought I was probably going to spend the rest of my life on disability, unable to do anything productive. 

I nearly failed out of high school, after starting out on track to graduate at the top of my class. My college transcript is all over the place. It's mostly A's and F's, actually, with barely anything in between. But I retook some F's, and graduated college. 

But something happened. I got my issues treated, I guess. And now, to the rest of the world, I'm ""normal."" Not just ""normal,"" but that ""smart"" person that other people want to be. I went back to school. My undergrad is in music. I want to become a statistician. I have a 4.0 in my post-bacc classes. In fact, I received the single highest grade in most of these classes. I'm starting to become the competitive student that I was half a lifetime ago (and fuck, it's literally been about half my lifetime at this point). 

But I'm not the same person. I'm *far* from the same person. I still have cognitive difficulties (I also had a severe concussion in the interim). I get accommodations from the disability office at school. People used to think that I would not be able to function, but last year I was told by a professor that I was using accommodations as a ""crutch."" 

No one believes that I struggle, and no one believes that I ever struggled. And to be honest, that's probably a good thing. 

Because I struggled academically for quite a bit before shit hit the fan and before I was diagnosed and received treatment, I made the mistake of telling myself that ""I'm not smart any more."" This is perhaps the most damaging thing I have ever done to myself, because it was so incongruent with the truth. But I was failing, and young me thought that meant that I wasn't smart. 

People *treated* me like I wasn't smart. Claiming otherwise would have been a lost cause. So I accepted the person that people thought I was. I started hiding from myself. 

And then I blinked, and now I'm here. Now I'm ""succeeding."" 

People don't see the suffering I've been through. I don't think people can process what it means to suffer through what I have. I know I can't. 

And at the same time, I also try to process what it means to be so ""gifted."" I'm far from the smartest person alive, but I think I'm actually for real going to get a PhD, and if I play my cards right, I might be able to get myself into a top school. I didn't think it was possible until recently, but bit by bit I'm building my credentials and it's starting to look strong. I have some way to go, but I'm getting closer. If I continue on the track I'm on, I'll be a competitive candidate for PhD programs. Imagine that-- *me* getting a PhD. 

Within my lifetime, society has told me that people like *me* can't achieve such things, but society has also told me that people like *me* will inevitably achieve ""great"" things. So which is it? Why must I suffer through all these mixed messages? Yes, my situation has changed, but I am the same person.   

I just can't process it. I am who I am, which is different than most other people are, apparently. The only thing that's stayed consistent over my entire life is that people tell me I'm ""different."" Well, I suppose it might be true, but fuck it if I know how to make sense of that information. 

Obviously you triggered something in me. This is something I get emotional about, because I don't know how to make sense of the dichotomy between how I've been treated at different times in my life. I feel alone, because other people don't get it or understand.

I feel this on a deep level. Up until maybe the 10th grade I was an A student who would get piles of positive attention for being the best in my classes and for winning competitions and the like. Then shit happened (started getting seizures, couldn't focus, severe anxiety) and my grades plummeted. Suddenly people were treating me like shit. They thought I was on drugs and they thought I was lying about struggling. 

This was 15 years ago, and life's better now and I'm the ""smart kid"" again. But damn did it make me realize how fucking judgmental people are. A lot of people don't understand why I'm slow to trust even people who treat me well, and it's because I know a significant portion of them would turn on me in an instant if circumstances changed.

I was an education major, and I'm ashamed at the sort of people we allow to qualify as ""teachers."" However, most universities are very hesitant to hire anyone who doesn't have a PhD to teach, so that does a good amount of ""weeding out"" of a good portion of people who don't have any sense.

Again, I'm sure there are some jerks who ""love"" to fail people, since I've been alive long enough that very little can surprise me. However, I have never met one of these people and I feel confident in saying that these people are not at all common. 

What I *do* believe is that there are many students who *think* that professors ""love"" or ""aim"" to fail people. This is a result of students not being able to understand the difference between ""believing that students should be held to high standards"" and ""aiming to fail people."" It is, however, a *big* difference. Most professors believe that passing a class should reflect a minimum level of competence, and the ""tough"" professors are not willing to budge on what that minimum is. This typically results in higher fail rates for the students of that professor than for the students of professors who are willing to lower the standards. Do professors with high standards ""aim"" to fail students? No. But they do not want to see the worth of their students' degree devalued, which is what happens when incompetent people are allowed to pass. In the end, *these* are the professors who usually bring value to your education and to your degree. 

Remember, the moment everyone can get a college degree is the moment a college degree becomes worthless, and we are approaching that point as a result of grade inflation. We have long surpassed that point with regards to a high school degree. Anyone can get a high school degree now, and it's no surprise that a high school diploma has become more or less meaningless."

My argument is that it's not the professor's fault if students are in this situation, since most of the time (at least in math), it's not up to the professor to choose what needs to be taught. They don't make the curriculum. A couple of weeks covering algebra is a couple of weeks *not* covering something else, which means that either the professor will have to rush through it later (which makes make everything even harder) or the school will have to add an additional class to cover the material that would have been lost as a result of the review in the first class.

This hurts students who come in with the proper prerequisite knowledge, because then the professor is wasting their time and the school may make them pay additional money for a class they shouldn't really have to take.

college,ffmy155,t1_ffmm2et,1580060091.0,"Thanks for sharing-- I'm glad I'm not the only one here that has seen this situation play out. The truth is that young people (18-22 year olds) who have lived more traditional ""privileged"" lives (went to high quality high school in the suburbs, received high grades, went straight to a T50 school or the like) probably haven't seen this (I will say that I believe there is a decline in student quality in T20-T50 schools, but you don't see students who are quite at elementary level). I live in a very segregated area (racially and economically) that is also very population dense. What this means is that I can simultaneously work in these two different bubbles while having pretty short commutes in both cases. 

In both of these bubbles, young people tend to be completely ignorant of what ""life"" is actually like for young people in the other bubble. Yes, the low-income kids understand that the rich kids have opportunities that they don't have. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure that the wealthy kids realize quite how privileged they are, but they know that poor people *exist*. I don't think they think much about it, though.

But neither groups can really conceptualize very well quite how *big* the education gap is. I live within commuting distance of some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the US, and I also live within commuting distance of a low-income city. I have worked with community college students in the low-income city and with high school students in the extremely wealthy neighborhood. I worked both these jobs at the same time.

Even as someone who considered myself more mindful than average of inequities, the superimposition of these two jobs on top of each other was out of this world. Neither of these bubbles have *any* interaction with each other. The drive from rich neighborhood to low-income city is 20 minutes, and yet no one from either place had friends or family in the other. The segregation is real. 

It is for this reason that when my college students were struggling to master basic arithmetic and my high school students were taking on calc 3 and differential equations, none of those students noticed anything ""odd"" about their situation. The state of education that each of these groups were in were the ""norm"" for their particular environment. 

That's a slight exaggeration. The CC students struggling with arithmetic were below average while the high school students taking Calc 3 and diff were above average. However, based on what I've seen (and data from placement tests) I'd say the ""average"" student at low-income CC came into freshman year at the elementary/middle school level. It's hard to pin down an exact grade level, but I was told by the person in charge of designing the remedial math curriculum that the ""average"" student comes in at the 5th grade level. 

In the wealthy public high school a few miles away, most students graduate with an AP calculus class under their belt. If it's AP calculus BC, that's an entire year worth of college level math. 

Now let's compare the two. One group enters at a 5th grade level, and another group enters at a sophomore in college level. That's an 8 year gap. 

It is jaw dropping. Simply jaw dropping. It's something you have to see to believe. 

I've noticed that nearly everyone (if not everyone) who graduates from this CC ready to complete a bachelor's in a STEM subject are international students or other students who received their k-12 education outside the bounds of the city. 

There's an elephant in the room, too, that relates to this. Since many of our international students are black students from Africa and the Carribbean and many of these students are successful, the CC holds these students up as examples of how ""well"" they're ""helping the African American community."" This is all a farce. The African Americans who were born and raised in the low-income city are failing, and they are failing *badly*, and administrators use international students with dark skin color to hide behind the failures. 

Of course, administrators cannot solve the systemic problems they face, but perhaps they should be honest about it. Perhaps being honest would allow us to work towards solutions, instead of sweeping them under the rug.

college,ffk1226,t3_eu1n06,1580012551.0,"Look up imposter syndrome-- it sounds like this may be you.

I've taken a number of tough courses and have gotten A's. I still feel like you. I don't really think it goes away. What helps me is realizing that nearly everyone else feels the same way. I have a professor who is well accomplished with credentials and a CV I could only dream of, but I noticed that now and then he'll make a mistake and you can tell from the look on his face and the comments he makes that it really gets to him, in sort of the ""this is so embarrassing, clearly I'm not smart enough for this and everyone can tell I'm an idiot"" sort of way. But he's not an idiot-- he's insanely smart and successful. Not only that, but he is a humble man of strong character (which is just as important). And you'll find that these ""imposter syndrome"" feelings do seem to occur more among humble people-- those who are aware of their own limitations. And this is a *good* thing, even if it makes you feel shitty. You are aware of your flaws, which to be honest, is more than can be said than many people who probably aren't anywhere near as smart as you.

So take solace that these feelings are common among the best and the brightest, and that there's a good chance that you yourself may be truly worthy of the ""best and brightest"" tag, if not now, then at the very least soon in the future, even if it doesn't feel like this is the case."
college,ffk017m,t1_ffjvvnd,1580011684.0,"I'm going to push back, but I'm going to preface it by saying that I'm coming from the perspective of someone who has experience working in a community college where close to 100% of the traditional college freshmen are coming in at below college level (I know it sounds like an exaggeration, but I'm not lying-- the exact number is above 90% ). We get *many* students who have only elementary level skills. In fact, there is a subset of students who are *below* the 3rd grade level. I promise you, I am not lying. The school serves a primarily disadvantaged population, and this is the reality that professors must face every day.

So keep in mind that this is my background, and that I understand that your school might be very different than this, and that at some schools a high failure rate among students may be more reflective of a problem with the professor than a problem with preparation among students.

However, at the CC that I have worked with, problems are deep and problems are systemic. Professors (and teachers in general) are not miracle workers. Realistically if someone comes in at an elementary school level, maybe they can work their butt off and get themselves up to a middle school level. But if it is a college level class, then is it ethical to allow someone with middle school level skills to pass a class that certifies that they have college level skills? I don't think so. 

And if, due to systemic problems, colleges classes are filled to the brim with students who aren't remotely at college level and ""the grading consistently fails most students,"" then is it ethical to start passing students *just* because ""it looks bad"" to fail students or because they worked hard and it's not their fault that they have these life struggles? It is true that it's not their fault and that they often work hard, but no, it is not ethical. A grade, at it's core, is meant to reflect that a student has obtained a certain level of skills or knowledge. If the student has not obtained this, then it is not ethical to pass that student.

These are very real problems that professors face. And I have never met a professor that enjoys failing students. I'm sure those jerks exist (because I *have* met jerks, so I wouldn't be surprised if these people exist). That being said, when most professors ""brag"" about failure rates, it's not that they're proud, it's that they want to warn students that it's a tough class so they aren't surprised by how much they have to do in order to meet the standards.

Sometimes these standards are pretty tough but completely achievable if you come in with the right background and have enough time in your schedule to put aside for studying. However, the modern student is not only typically underprepared, but has outside obligations such as work that they must adhere to. Remember that ""traditionally"" students didn't work while they were in school, which means more time to devote to study.

As I said, this boils down to systemic issues coming into play.

However, the curriculum for calculus 1 (and presumably other tough classes) have stayed the same. 

What I *have* seen, which does appear to be a viable solution, is that they break Calc 1 into two semesters-- Calc 1a and Calc 1b. This allows a slower pace so that students can master the material to adequate standards, and fail rates go down. This again has little to do with the professor-- professors are bound to a certain curriculum much of the time, so if the professor's going ""too fast,"" it's often because that's their *job*.

On the flip side, I've seen a much worse trend. Courses that are extremely watered down and easy A's. This makes students happy, but they learn so little. Then they come on r/college and complain that they didn't learn anything in college and that college is useless.

Well, yes, it is, if you demand that professors lower standards to the extent that you are no longer getting anything of value from your classes.

In other words, the issue is *much* more complicated than ""if  the grading consistently fails most students, it needs to be graded more leniently.""

If the grading consistently fails most students, then perhaps the professor is the problem and the professor needs to ease up on their grading, *or* there are some major problems in student preparation or in student time commitments or in curriculum design that need to be addressed. 

Again, it seems like *one* simple solution might be breaking harder classes into two semesters instead of one. But that hardly touches on root problems, like inadequate k-12 preparation or the stressful lives of students that get in the way of success. Again, none of these issues are the professors' faults, and it often isn't the students' faults either.

Again, I say this as someone who has worked in an environment where these issues are ubiquitous. I would expect a different experience at a competitive university. However, these are most definitely realities for many people. A professor who consistently gets classes full of students who can't string together coherent sentences is a professor whose grading will consistently fail most students. And no, that professor does *not* need to start passing these students. Eventually these students need to face the reality that they are not college ready. They deserve good things in their lives, yes, but they do not deserve to pass."

> Are curves even that common any more?

I think I had a test last semester where a 35% was enough to get students a C, and we still had D's and F's. 

To be honest, I think it has to do with the fact that in math, professors want to put really challenging problems on exams, not because they think anyone or many people can do them, but just because they want to see who *can* figure them out.

This is similar to how grading is done in many countries outside of the US. The US has a lot of grade inflation, so most subjects can't distinguish between ""good"" students and ""great"" students, since they all get A's, and it's just expected that many people will get grades that are 100% or close to 100%. In my school at least, this culture doesn't exist in the math department. They want to know the difference between ""good"" students and ""great"" students, so they give some insanely tough questions on exams, and then ""curve"" or adjust the grades so that a person's grade reasonably reflect a student's relative performance in the class.

I rarely see this outside of math or ""hard"" STEM departments, and I don't even see it at every school. I also only see it in the upper level courses at my school. 

I'll be real, I'm super proud of the fact that in that last class I mentioned (where 35% obtained a person a C) I managed to get a raw score high enough that it'd (barely) be an A without a curve. Holy shit was it hard-- those exams had some whoppers.

In *most* classes I feel the same way as you do about curves. I'm against them in classes where scores are already inflated (which are most classes). But the reality is there are many students who are amazing students in the math class I took last semester but got slightly lower raw scores than me but deserved an A. In fact, I also think those students with a 50% who got C's deserved those C's. If you can get a 50% on some of the exams we're given, you're doing pretty well.

I've also been told that this is a class where because of the nature of the class, a recommendation from the professor of this class is *expected* if you apply to a PhD program. I have no doubt because of how the tests are designed that my professor was able to tag me as a ""heavy-weight"" who has the potential to hold their own in a PhD program (I hope). This is only possible because the professor made exams insanely hard, and then recalibrated the scores afterwards. The curve made sense in the context of the class. 

> I only had to finish Calc 1 when I was a Bio major

I've never taken bio at the college level (which is funny because I want to be a biostatistician, but life is weird like that, and contrary to what one would think, it's actually common to get into biostatistics with no bio background) but I would think it'd actually be more time consuming than math. Maybe that's because while I'm great at problem solving, I'm really shitty at memorizing. My head spins when I think of all the stuff the biology majors have to remember. The thought of it gives me anxiety."

This is for real. I'm in my late 20's, and when I went back to school I was *amazed* at how easy it was to review all the math I learned in high school (Khan Academy). I was able to jump right back into school without a hitch because of it. 

In high school when I did homework, if I didn't understand something and the book was too confusing, I'd have to wait until the next day to ask my teacher. The youtube videos we have today did not exist back then. There was no where near as much on the internet then as there is now.

That being said, it gets tougher in upper level classes. Eventually, you get to the point where explanations or answers aren't all that easy to google. And I'll be honest, I think that the fact that I grew up before instant gratification helps a ton, because when I get an insanely tough problem, I find that other students are much more likely to quit. I'm more used to sitting through the discomfort of not having anything but my notes and textbook to rely on.

It is much easier than it's ever been to learn new things. However, students today often feel lost when they *don't* have acces to power points, lecture notes, practice quizzes, youtube videos, and all of the things you mentioned, and that is a bit concerning, because eventually if you become advanced enough in *any* field, these things will no longer be there for you. While I understand that most students don't intend on pursuing a PhD, it's worth noting that one of the really cool things about a PhD is that you usually get so specialized that you are the *only* person in perhaps the world who knows as much about your topic as you do. At that point, of course, you're relying on the ""old school"" methods of learning, since  you're *way* beyond quizlet level.

This is a post-bacc, though. My undergrad was in music education. For education classes I could put in almost no work and get A's. For music classes, the time spent on each course could be anywhere from barely anything to all my free time. Your mileage may vary.

In general, 100 and 200 level classes are easier than 300 and 400 level classes. This is why (unfortunately for you) a single bachelors is worth more than 3 associates. 

It also depends on major. Some majors are easier than others. Education is a walk in the park. Music is challenging but how hard it is it depends on the particular repertoire you get assigned and your area of expertise. Chorale methods and Jazz Improv were my two worst classes, for example, because I am a classical instrumentalist. They took way more time for me than music theory, which I aced without a problem. However, many vocalists come in with very little formal theoretical background and struggle with music theory, but they naturally didn't have to put as much time into chorale methods as I did.

And then there's math. I love math and can put hours into it without noticing the time go by, but I'm not going to pretend people don't tend to struggle with it. Most people who are good enough to make it to upper level math classes can complete the classes without having study time take over their entire lives. That being said, I don't think you can really ""wing it"" as much in math as you can in some other majors. It's tough to make it happen without taking the time to review and to practice, although maybe it can be done if you're the ""C's get degrees"" type, considering some of the generous curves I've seen.

Of course, this is just a hunch-- I could be wrong. I see it all the time in r/college, though. It seems that very few people on this subreddit actually care about an education. Most seem to only care about the piece of paper they receive after completing 4 years.

I do notice a difference between freshmen and sophomores, though-- a lot of growing up happens in that first year. Still, I find that I'm often disappointed with what I've seen even from college graduates. I don't keep my hopes high, to be honest. One would *think* that logic and reason are not high expectations, but I find that these are areas that many people actually struggle greatly with. In STEM usually the ""hardest"" classes are the math classes, and in humanities, it's philosophy. The common thread between the ""hardest"" classes are rigor in logic and reason. I personally think that logic should be taught in elementary school, but I really don't think that ""critical thinking skills"" are taught much at all in k-12.

I'll be honest. I no longer teach, but I studied education and have a social network full of teachers, and I find that while some are amazing, the logical reasoning skills of the ""average"" k-12 teacher is lacking. Education is not great at recruiting the best and brightest.

There is not a mixed message, because I never said that I believe there is anything *wrong* with tearing apart someone who disagrees with you. We can embrace bias, and we can embrace disagreements. It's about having an open discussion, and that means taking hits now and then. 

The point is, you *should* embrace your bias, and you *should* be open to getting torn apart for it, and although I'm sure you'd still get downvoted in this sub for your opinions if you were more straightforward about them, I believe that downvotes are lazy. If you disagree with something, you (by ""you,"" I mean people in general) should be able to put forth a counter argument. Downvoting does nothing to further any sort of dialogue, but instead shuts people down. 

Again, I use ""you"" in the general sense-- I'd apply it to myself, too. I posted something some time ago in r/professors that got downvotes, and I edited to say that I'd appreciate it if anyone who downvoted me could explain their reasoning. I specifically stated that if they downvoted me and didn't say anything, then I'd assume that they don't have a good argument and that I'd maintain my current opinion, but that if they responded, they might be able to get me to change my mind.

I have higher expectations for r/professors than r/college, and they came through. Some people responded, and although they didn't change my mind completely, they shifted my views to a more moderate stance. 

Again, I don't *quite* have the same high hopes for r/college, but I think it is worth setting a standard as best I can. We all have opinions, but any opinion worth having is an opinion worth defending. And if you can no longer defend it, then maybe it's not an opinion worth having anymore.

I may be projecting, but I feel pretty confident that it's anger rather than fear. I don't know how a stranger on reddit could possibly trigger fear in someone, but then again, I can only speak for myself, so I could be wrong. I think when dems say they are ""afraid,"" it's more in a general abstract sense, as in ""I'm afraid for the future of the country,"" not in a literal sense. The are exceptions, though. I have a trans friend who is *literally* afraid, because of how much of a target she is among hateful people. Outside of that, it's mostly just anger towards the other ""side.""

Sorry-- I think I worded it wrong. By not partisan, I mean not ""liberal,"" specifically. Most people who care enough to respond at all are probably partisan. Again, I say this mostly because I am very quick to downvote people in my ""in-group"" (progressives) who step over the line, because I think that when they do so and they do so publicly, it hurts the movement as a whole. Using the same reasoning, I would think that conservatives might downvote your posts as well, if they think it stepped over the line.

I've been (sort of?) diagnosed as Aspie. My psychiatrist consistently said I had Asperger's every time I saw him for about a year and then when I asked him ""Why do you think I have Aspergers?"" he said ""Well... you have Asperger's traits"" and then he went off tangent and started talking about how I'm like his son who had a brain injury at birth (I also have some neurological issues) so I'm not really sure if he thinks I have Asperger's or if he thinks my brain is fucked up and it comes across in an autistic way or what. Funny he chooses to beat around the bush when he's the one who thinks I have Asperger's-- he should know that I have no idea what he's getting at.

r/college is not the best subreddit for rational conversation. If you're looking for that, I highly recommend getting into reading [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/about/) and maybe getting involved in related subreddits like r/slatestarcodex and r/themotte (I think the latter is an outgrowth of the former because it was getting to ""controversial"" but I was on a break from reddit and much of the internet during the whole controversy so idk what the story is). Still, these are go-to places for rationalist ""nerd"" types (and if you hang out there for a while, you'll definitely notice it attracts a distinct ""type"").

I addressed this in the other comment, but I think that you missed the fact that your ""observation"" included more than just an ""observation."" The moment you tied the notion of flag displaying with respect for country is the moment it became more than an observation. 

I don't disagree that people responded emotionally. 

> and without the logical and academic viewpoint that a ""College"" subreddit should include.

Lol, I guess maybe it's because I'm older, but when I think of college students I think of, well-- not logical and academic approaches to things. People are in college to *learn* those things, and a college degree is supposed to signal those things, but it takes a while to get there and many college students are not there yet (and sadly, many never will be). 

That's why I have *much* more faith in other subreddits. You have to look for an older and more well-educated crowd to get what you're looking for. r/professors is not for students, so I wouldn't go there (I'm a student but I used to be a teacher and I tutor college students, so I blend in pretty well, but without the perspective of the professor's side of things you shouldn't go there). Still, they *can* hold the sort of discussion you want, is my point, as I mentioned in my example. As I said, if you want a *really* good rationalist viewpoint, [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/about/) is the way to go.

You're not going to like the post I just finished, then-- I tear you apart. 

My argument (in my other post) is that you are flawed in your thinking that you are somehow not imbuing ""emotion"" (bias/judgment) into your own posts. Your ""observation"" was not *just* an observation, but a judgment. I reacted *both* emotionally *and* academically, because I believe that one can have feelings and opinions about something while also giving a well thought out answer. 

In general, I believe it is best to acknowledge that bias is impossible to get rid of completely, so the honest solution is to embrace that bias and to make the best, most well-thought argument as possible while maintaining openness about ones bias.

Edit: I agree that lack of unity in this country is a problem. But it is not one with an easy solution. Different people have different opinions as to the causes, as well. I tend to lean on the side of ""click-bait"" media and non-unified news sources (that include ""fake news"" and propaganda) being a large root of the issue. Media likes to ""play up"" problems and this seeps into everyday culture.

I think that people going out into the real world and interacting with others unlike themselves is the best solution. I get mad at Trump supporters all the time, but then I remember that they aren't bad people because I personally know Trump supporters that are good people. Hatred builds from segregation and isolation from those that we hate. All we have to do is to meet each other in real life and to sit down and have face to face conversations to realize that none of us (with the exception of a small few individuals) are really that bad."
college,fficggv,t1_ffi8frc,1579970569.0,"You're not getting downvoted for your ""observations,"" you're getting downvoted for the judgments you attach to those observations. I realize that I have ""judgments"" in my posts, too, but those judgments are against only specific US presidents (neither or which reads this subreddit, presumably). Your judgments, on the other hand, are a direct attack non-flag flying college students and on liberal college students (two separate but overlapping groups), which I assume *many* of the readers here identify as.

In other words, you attack readers of this thread, and then are surprised you're downvoted. Here are some examples of the obvious ways in which you are not only ""making an observation,"" but clearly and overtly attacking individuals who likely read this subreddit:

> how many college girls still respect their country enough to put that in their dorm room these days?

This implies that college students who don't have a flag in their dorm don't respect their country as much as those who do. This is *very* insulting to the many patriots who choose not to have a flag in their room. 

> Must be many scared liberals out there, for so many downvotes on a simple observation.

Instead of reflecting on how your ""observation"" (aka unjustified insult) was perhaps out of line, you instead decide that 42 downvotes (as of now) is a signal that everyone else is wrong, and that it must be because of partisan beliefs. You also imply that people with these beliefs must be ""scared,"" which has a negative connotation. It is also not at all reflective of how liberals actually feel. I'd say that right now the feeling is more one of ""anger,"" due to how the flag is being used as a tool to imply that liberals are less patriotic, which, I should note, you did in the above comment when you implied that non-flag flyers (who we both know are more likely to be liberal) are less patriotic than their conservative peers. Not only is it in bad taste to say these things, but it is blatantly false. Many liberals join the military and fight for their country in all sorts of ways. Liberals make sacrifices for their country, just as many of their conservative peers do (or don't). Some of them fly flags, and some of them don't. 

> There are a lot of butthurt liberals in college these days, it seems. Getting mighty upset about a simple observation.

There you go again-- insulting people and then getting upset that people are upset that you're insulting people. 

Here's another:

> but with all the downvotes, there are clearly many butthurt liberals.

Did it ever occur to you that not everyone who disagrees with you or thinks that your posts are in bad taste are liberals? I'm a progressive, but I'm quick to downvote the progressives who come onto reddit and act like jerks. You're making your ""side"" look bad. There are some conservatives out there who *don't* go around insulting liberals when people disagree with them, and will self-reflect and apologize if they realize they pushed it a little too far. Why can't you be one of *those* conservatives?

For what it's worth, this is why dems think Trump is about a billion times worse than Bush. Bush has some humility. Trump can't ever admit a mistake, and it's destroying the country. 

> It was a simple observation, I didn't say it was bad (or good), just that I found it interesting.

It is *very* clear that you have positive sentiments towards flag flying and negative sentiments towards non-flag flying. As I mentioned in another post, you have to live under a rock to not understand the partisan implications of flag-flying in the US, and it is clear that you're a partisan (I am too-- but at least I admit it). I assume you read my other post, but I feel discomfort with flag flying because of what it signals. I also don't think flag flying is *inherently* good or bad, but it sure doe signal something, and to you that signal is ""good,"" while to me that signal is ""bad."" 

To pretend it doesn't mean anything to you and then to start insulting members of this thread when they challenge you is pretty telling. Just be honest with yourself-- you *like* what flag flying signals (whatever that signal means to you). To you it means ""respect for country,"" and you're mad that this isn't what it signals to many modern college students, who you choose to brand as ""butthurt liberals.""

>  It's amazing how people take a simple observation and turn it into something that is somehow counter to their own viewpoint.

I hope my above comments make it clear that you presented *much* more than just ""observations,"" but instead implied judgments that there is something inherently wrong with those who disagree with you. Let's be real-- you did start this. The initiating statement that began this whole ""controversy"" was the one you made that I will quote again here:

> how many college girls still respect their country enough to put that in their dorm room these days?

This implies, as I stated above, that individuals who don't fly a flag don't respect their country as much as those who do. Them's fighting words. It was not an observation, but a judgment against those who don't fly flags, and that sure as hell is going to get pushback. 

> It is funny to me how many scared liberals freak out and get so defensive about it though.

There you go again with the insults. And you know what? Liberals are *justified* in being defensive, because you *attacked* them. That's what people do when they are attacked-- they get defensive. You implied that non-flag flyers are less patriotic. Patriots who choose not to fly flags won't stand for such attacks. Many of these patriots may be liberals, and some might not be. But you are attacking the love that non-flag flyers have of their country, and I'm sure that many non-flag flyers love their country enough that they are justified and calling you out for your ignorance.

If your best rebuttal to that is an insult, it shows how weak your opinions (that you claim are just ""observations"" but are really opinions that are trying to hide inside observations) are. 

You *can* apologize to the people you insulted by acknowledging that some of the most patriotic Americans don't fly flags. This is what an adult would do. I know that acting like an adult is not in style these days (again, take a look at our current president), but I'd advise it to anyone who was not born to an extremely wealthy family-- life can get rough when people don't like you, and people don't like people who can't accept that they've stepped over the line and who can't apologize. 

I hope, perhaps, that this at the very least will help you understand why you're getting downvoted. It is so obvious *why* you're getting downvoted that I feel silly spelling it out, but on the off chance that you genuinely don't understand why and want to learn why, here it is. Please take a moment to think about how your language is perceived by other people, and how ""observations"" are not necessarily free of bias or judgment."
college,ffi8mo7,t1_ffi7bwb,1579967916.0,"Fair enough-- you're right, I think, that flag flying were diminished 6 years ago compared to some time in the past. However, that was after a very large increase in flag flying rates in 2001. I think it does have to do with unity and support for the government, though. After 9/11, the US was as non-polarized as I ever remember it being in my lifetime. I also remember the '90s being non-polarized compared to today. However after 9/11 was an extremely unified time and after that the level of polarization increased continuously-- I don't think there was any significant dip in polarization since 2001. A continuous decrease in flag flying rates since 2001 makes sense in this context. 

By the time 2008 rolled around, we thought Bush would go down in history as one of the worst presidents (that sentiment did not age well) because of his initiation of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

Of course, the answer is not so simplistic. We all know that republicans are into flying flags and democrats not so much. This held true, from what I can tell, when Obama was president. As someone who lives in a blue bubble, I feel reasonably confident in saying that dems have become less and less likely to fly American flags (I *do* see many ""hate has no home here"" and other similar flags, so dems clearly have nothing wrong with flags in general). But what about republicans and independents and moderates? I'd suspect that as the country gets less moderate and more polarized, the independents and moderates would also decrease in American flag flying. 

But then there's republicans. This is a tough one, because I don't know how flag flying rates have changed for them. They've always been the ""flag flyers."" But lowered rates among dems, moderates, and independents would be enough to lower the total rates, I'd think. And the more dems, moderates, and independents stop flying flags, the more it becomes a ""republican"" thing, and the more non-republicans feel alienated about the idea. It is a self-fulfilling cycle.

My prediction is that it, like everything else in this country, will just continue to be more and more of a partisan issue, since it will become more and more of a partisan ""signal,"" for the reason I described."

First year classes. Not just gen eds, but the first classes you take for your major. Unless your school is a competitive school, these classes tend to be *really* easy in order to help students ""transition"" from high school to college. There are exceptions, of course (""weed-out"" classes). In my experience, weed-out classes aren't actually hard-- they're just classes that have college-level standards, and they're hard for freshman because they aren't used to the expectations of such classes. The rigor often starts ramping up after the first year, as professors have more of an expectation that students are adults and can handle a challenge. This isn't the case everywhere, though, in which case I'd try to find a place that does challenge students. Being challenged is a sign you're learning, so as much as people complain about classes being ""hard,"" challenging classes are usually a sign you're getting a bang for your buck (it might also be a sign that you have a *really* shitty professor, so your mileage may vary). 

I don't know what you mean by ""red flags"" in your English Comp class, but writing is an *extremely* important skill. I was lucky to have an amazing professor for my English Comp class, but I understand that not everyone does. If it's an adjunct teaching your course, they're probably drastically underpaid, in which case I hardly blame them for not giving a shit. The shitty part is that even though these professors barely get paid, tuition for students is through the roof. The system is broken. Use ratemyprofessor and word of mouth to find the best professors. Professor quality alone can really make college a better experience.

I know that seems like a lot when you're in high school, but remember that these are college level classes. $100 a class is such a steal that if I were your parent I'd be tempted to make you take them (I would never actually do that, but you get the point). The same class taken a few years later could cost you thousands of dollars. Compared to this, $100 is pennies. Do you have to buy your own book for your high school AP classes? Because in college, books alone will cost more than that, and that's not even including the cost of the class. 

Unless your family is really poor and legitimately cannot spare $100 per AP class, taking as many AP classes as possible is most certainly going to be the best *financial* decision. Whether it's the best decision for you is differen (you may not want to overload yourself), but if you can handle the workload, I'd always advise as many AP's as possible *just* because of how little it costs."

No-- they give assignments and have high standards because the point of the class if that students demonstrate a certain level of competency, and this is what it takes to make that happen. 

In my experience, most gen ed professors water down their courses as much as they can when it's only taken by non-majors, but they don't do so to the extent that the integrity of the course is lost. They don't want to water it down so much that you don't learn what the class is meant to teach you, which is likely what would happen if they didn't give so much work.

Also, some gen-eds contain a mix of majors and non-majors. If that's the case, they're keeping standards high because obviously the majors will need it, and so you more or less have to hang along for the ride. The way to avoid that, of course, is to try to take gen-ed classes that are specifically only designated for non-majors."
college,ff3vh68,t1_ff3ox4g,1579549738.0,"> You haven't put forth any sort of legal argument to back this up.

Nor have you. It is clear from the fact that you cited a statute about hospital admission that you do not know what you are talking about-- it can hardly be considered an ""argument."" I didn't say this with the intention of attacking you, but it is important to know the difference. You are acting as if you know what these legal terms mean in the context of mental health commitment, yet you don't. It is Dunning-Kruger. Your legal ""knowledge"" is straight up bullshit. Each state has mental health specific laws that are separate from laws relating to arrest, so your intuition is off, since you don't seem to be aware of mental-health specific laws. And again, it is *very* important to understand the difference between being forcibly transported to the hospital versus forcibly committed. The latter has much higher standards than the former. 

[Here's a good overview about how it works](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4195632/). It's written specifically geared towards physicians, but it does mention the role of the police somewhere in there. I mostly recommend reading just so you have an idea of how the system works.

[Here's the overview relevant to MA specifically](https://mhlac.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/admission_and_discharge.pdf). 

Note that it says

>  Section 12(a) allows for an individual to be brought against his
or her will to such a hospital for evaluation. 

and, under ""who can sign a Section 12(a) appilication,"" it says

> Pursuant to Section 12(a), a physician, nurse practitioner, qualified psychiatric nurse, qualified psychologist, licensed independent clinical social worker, or police officer may apply to admit anyone to a facility if he or she believes that, without hospitalization, the person meets the standard for admission. 

[Here's the form that the MA cops have to fill out to document transportation](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/10/05/section%2012%20order.pdf).

Note that the standard for legally being able to forcibly *transport* a person is simply a ""belief"" of danger of a person to themselves or others. Hence the fact that I use the phrase ""good faith belief"" so much. It's because that *is* the standard. If a history of self-harm (even if OP stated that they have stopped) is enough for a cop to believe that OP may harm herself, the cop was well withing his/her rights to make the call that he/she did. Should the police get better training so they don't make bad calls? Yes. But legally the police were allowed to do what they did. 

Remember, this is for transportation. Section 12(a) is also an *application* for involuntary admittance (which transportation is not-- anyone with the proper credentials and a good faith belief is allow to transport against the person's will). Section 12(b) is where the physician chooses to admit the patient or reject the application. Clearly, in OP's case, the physician rejected it and OP went home.

Unless you have a dying relative or are attending an academic conference or have some other reasonable excuse, the fact that you scheduled a trip during the semester will make you look bad.

Edit: To clarify, it is legal because cops have the liberty to do this if they believe someone may be a danger to themselves or others. From a legal standpoint, it does not matter whether or not they are *correct* about this, because they are not trained to make that determination. What matters is that the *doctor* is correct, and it is on the police to make sure the person in question makes it safely to an environment where they can be given an appropriate evaluation. This means forcibly transporting them to a hospital. Again, totally legal. Remember, the whole reason the system is set up this way is because random people, cops, and EMS are *not* trained to evaluate these situations, so the only reasonable solution is to get any person in question to a trained mental health professional ASAP.

> I think its not easy to understand or notice if you are white or not from the US.

While your theory is a reasonable one for someone who's looking into the US culture from the ""outside,"" it's really off target, imo.

To understand US racism, you have to understand American history, and how strongly slavery was part of the economy back 150+ years ago and how it's role in the economy lead to some pretty inhumane practices. But it's not *just* that slavery was inhumane. It's just that there was an entire culture built around slavery to justify it's existence. After all, abusing human beings in the manner that slave owners did is obviously immoral. But the southern economy would collapse without it. How to handle this cognitive dissonance? Instill a culture where black people are seen as subhuman. It was normal at that time to claim that slave owners were doing slaves a ""favor"" by ""taking care of them."" In fact, I've heard this claim made by Americans alive today (sadly).

It was a dark and atrocious part of our history. But the culture that was built around the institution of slavery was so strong that it would be absurd for it to just disappear. While racism today is not even comparable to racism 150 years ago, attitudes have still been passed on from generation to generation. In the mean time, laws such as Jim Crow had reinforced legal discrimination.  

The whole issue is much more complicated than I even described here, but the main point is that our country was, as they say, ""built on the backs of slaves."" And slaves, for the most part, were black. The entire history of our country consists of the oppression of African Americans specifically (other minorities are a different story with their own separate histories, although many have been oppressed in their own way), and lies about black people being ""lesser than"" their lighter skinned peers have carried through to today. 

Again, the whole thing is pretty complicated, and the nuance is hard to understand if you are not American. Although I am American, I myself am white, and I have had to immerse myself in different communities and to read and listen to the stories and history of our country in order to pick up on additional nuances of the situation, but there is still much that we as Americans are aware of regarding our race issues that is ""obvious"" to us but very foreign and bizarre to non-Americans. 

I have friends from countries all over the world (all different continents) and race issues in America are very confusing regardless of whether a person is from Europe, Africa, or Asia. We Americans grow up knowing our history and being taught it, but I don't know how much of that you're exposed to. Just know that it goes *way* beyond a sense of nationalism/patriotism. In fact, a Balkan friend of mine was explaining that where he is from, there isn't ""racism"" like there is in America, but discrimination that is based on a sense of nationalism, so if the attitudes are more nationalism-based where you live, I see how your assumption/theory would be most intuitive to you.

If you mean employers, I'd say yes. You will have disadvantages. A significant part of the advantage a college degree brings is that it signals that you have specific *specialized* skills and knowledge. I've personally noticed that the more general the degree, the more challenging it is for people to find work. 

I have a music degree, which (clueless) people say is ""useless,"" but I had no trouble at all finding work because I had a specialization. If you are an employer looking for someone with a specific set of skills and knowledge, you will always choose someone with the appropriate specialization over someone with a ""general"" degree.

There also, I think, may be a bias or stigma against a general degree because it implies that someone either couldn't hack it in a specialized path or simply weren't willing to follow through. Very few people choose a ""general"" degree from the beginning (which itself looks bad, because it indicates some level of not planning ahead or being directionless). Being able to follow through with things is a positive indicator to employers, as is having direction. They want to know that you know what you're doing and can see a project through. They will want to know why you ""gave up"" on your original major.

Even psychology and neuroscience, which are the better degrees, typically require a graduate level education before you can really land a ""good"" job (although there may be some positions in the business/office world that you can get with just a basic psychology or general degree). I fear that you may be shooting yourself in the foot, though, with a general degree. What if you want to get a graduate degree some time down the road? Will the general degree hurt you (I don't actually know the answer to that one).

I want to add, in addition to what I said yesterday, that if you are aiming for ivy tier schools (like Columbia) you really should be challenging yourself with tough AP classes and getting A's in them. I don't want to be a pain in the ass and harp on the ""I don't want to take classes I don't need"" statement, but this attitude is a *serious* turn-off for ivies. They usually look for the ""best of the best,"" and the ""best of the best"" tend to have broad interests and tend to be willing to challenge themselves in areas that they might be less comfortable in. Grade inflation in high school is so high in 2020 that grades alone are not enough to get into a school like Columbia. There are way more students with top grades than there are spots at these schools, so you have to distinguish yourself in additional ways, and one of the ways that students tend to distinguish themselves is to, quite bluntly, take as many AP's as humanly possible and then get A's in them.

I'm not saying this is a good idea or even healthy, but I think you need to have a realistic idea of what you're up against. If this seems a bit much, that's okay. I think being focused on your end goal is fine and that if you want to pick and choose only relevant classes that is a perfectly okay choice and that you'll still have a realistic shot at some really, really good schools that are top schools but maybe not quite ivy tier.  

Honestly, there are many great schools in the northeast, and to start you might just want to check out any school ranked in the top 100. Ranking certainly isn't gospel, but it's a reasonable guide to use absent of any other information about quality. Most people use US News to check rankings.

Personally, I had a great k-12 education with several teachers who were straight up grammar nazis. I have minimal ""natural talent"" when it comes to writing skills-- it had to be beaten into me (figuratively, not literally-- my k-12 teachers wouldn't harm a fly). I say this because I've found that having strong writing skills has served me well again and again in my life, and because despite the pain that my teachers put me through, rising to their expectations has paid off. Whether we like it or not, strong written communication skills signal to others that we are ""smart"" and ""well educated."" If you write well, you will undoubtedly be treated better by others (professors, employers, coworkers, colleagues, peers, etc.). It's not a conscious thing, I don't think. It's just that strong writing skills give others more confidence in your competence in other areas. While many people are great at some things and bad at others, there is a very real general tendency for people who are good at some things to be good at other things. In other words, being a strong writer really is a low-key signal that you are a person worth hiring and a person who can be trusted to do a job correctly.

Sorry for the mini-rant. This is all independent of your professor being a jerk (which he very well may be), but I have to stand by his strictness. I'm not saying I'm the best writer in the world, either, but I'd be awful if it weren't for my grammar nazi teachers. In the end, I am very glad that I have these skills, since I know it allows others to feel more confident about my abilities. 

If your professor would have otherwise given you 100 on your paper, then you are probably pretty close to being a strong writer.

college,ff9celh,t1_ff8t1ww,1579709813.0,">  Idk what you mean by 'freshmen classes'

First year classes. Not just gen eds, but the first classes you take for your major. Unless your school is a competitive school, these classes tend to be *really* easy in order to help students ""transition"" from high school to college. There are exceptions, of course (""weed-out"" classes). In my experience, weed-out classes aren't actually hard-- they're just classes that have college-level standards, and they're hard for freshman because they aren't used to the expectations of such classes. The rigor often starts ramping up after the first year, as professors have more of an expectation that students are adults and can handle a challenge. This isn't the case everywhere, though, in which case I'd try to find a place that does challenge students. Being challenged is a sign you're learning, so as much as people complain about classes being ""hard,"" challenging classes are usually a sign you're getting a bang for your buck (it might also be a sign that you have a *really* shitty professor, so your mileage may vary). 

I don't know what you mean by ""red flags"" in your English Comp class, but writing is an *extremely* important skill. I was lucky to have an amazing professor for my English Comp class, but I understand that not everyone does. If it's an adjunct teaching your course, they're probably drastically underpaid, in which case I hardly blame them for not giving a shit. The shitty part is that even though these professors barely get paid, tuition for students is through the roof. The system is broken. Use ratemyprofessor and word of mouth to find the best professors. Professor quality alone can really make college a better experience.

If this is your attitude, tech school might be a better fit. Don't think that this means you have to go to a vocational or 2-year school, though.

They don't want to water it down so much that you don't learn what the class is meant to teach you, which is likely what would happen if they didn't give so much work.

Also, some gen-eds contain a mix of majors and non-majors. If that's the case, they're keeping standards high because obviously the majors will need it, and so you more or less have to hang along for the ride.

Nor have you. It is clear from the fact that you cited a statute about hospital admission that you do not know what you are talking about-- it can hardly be considered an ""argument.""

You are acting as if you know what these legal terms mean in the context of mental health commitment, yet you don't. It is Dunning-Kruger. Your legal ""knowledge"" is straight up bullshit. Each state has mental health specific laws that are separate from laws relating to arrest, so your intuition is off, since you don't seem to be aware of mental-health specific laws. And again, it is *very* important to understand the difference between being forcibly transported to the hospital versus forcibly committed. The latter has much higher standards than the former. 

[Here's a good overview about how it works](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4195632/). It's written specifically geared towards physicians, but it does mention the role of the police somewhere in there. I mostly recommend reading just so you have an idea of how the system works.

[Here's the overview relevant to MA specifically](https://mhlac.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/admission_and_discharge.pdf). 

Note that it says

>  Section 12(a) allows for an individual to be brought against his
or her will to such a hospital for evaluation. 

and, under ""who can sign a Section 12(a) appilication,"" it says

> Pursuant to Section 12(a), a physician, nurse practitioner, qualified psychiatric nurse, qualified psychologist, licensed independent clinical social worker, or police officer may apply to admit anyone to a facility if he or she believes that, without hospitalization, the person meets the standard for admission. 

[Here's the form that the MA cops have to fill out to document transportation](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/10/05/section%2012%20order.pdf).

Note that the standard for legally being able to forcibly *transport* a person is simply a ""belief"" of danger of a person to themselves or others. Hence the fact that I use the phrase ""good faith belief"" so much. It's because that *is* the standard. If a history of self-harm (even if OP stated that they have stopped) is enough for a cop to believe that OP may harm herself, the cop was well withing his/her rights to make the call that he/she did. Should the police get better training so they don't make bad calls? Yes. But legally the police were allowed to do what they did. 

Remember, this is for transportation. Section 12(a) is also an *application* for involuntary admittance (which transportation is not-- anyone with the proper credentials and a good faith belief is allow to transport against the person's will). Section 12(b) is where the physician chooses to admit the patient or reject the application. Clearly, in OP's case, the physician rejected it and OP went home.

What matters is that the *doctor* is correct, and it is on the police to make sure the person in question makes it safely to an environment where they can be given an appropriate evaluation. This means forcibly transporting them to a hospital. Again, totally legal. Remember, the whole reason the system is set up this way is because random people, cops, and EMS are *not* trained to evaluate these situations, so the only reasonable solution is to get any person in question to a trained mental health professional ASAP.

That being said, I'm in OP's situation. I'm a (white) domestic student interested in this school, and were I to get accepted I'd be the only domestic student in the program. I've talked professors in the department, though, and I certainly don't smell any fishy business.

TooAfraidToAsk,fez5vi9,t1_fewpyhj,1579454087.0,"You're not American, so I want to reiterate what u/BADMANvegeta said:

> I think its not easy to understand or notice if you are white or not from the US.

While your theory is a reasonable one for someone who's looking into the US culture from the ""outside,"" it's really off target, imo.

To understand US racism, you have to understand American history, and how strongly slavery was part of the economy back 150+ years ago and how it's role in the economy lead to some pretty inhumane practices. But it's not *just* that slavery was inhumane. It's just that there was an entire culture built around slavery to justify it's existence. After all, abusing human beings in the manner that slave owners did is obviously immoral. But the southern economy would collapse without it. How to handle this cognitive dissonance? Instill a culture where black people are seen as subhuman. It was normal at that time to claim that slave owners were doing slaves a ""favor"" by ""taking care of them."" In fact, I've heard this claim made by Americans alive today (sadly).

It was a dark and atrocious part of our history. But the culture that was built around the institution of slavery was so strong that it would be absurd for it to just disappear. While racism today is not even comparable to racism 150 years ago, attitudes have still been passed on from generation to generation. In the mean time, laws such as Jim Crow had reinforced legal discrimination.  

The whole issue is much more complicated than I even described here, but the main point is that our country was, as they say, ""built on the backs of slaves."" And slaves, for the most part, were black. The entire history of our country consists of the oppression of African Americans specifically (other minorities are a different story with their own separate histories, although many have been oppressed in their own way), and lies about black people being ""lesser than"" their lighter skinned peers have carried through to today. 

Again, the whole thing is pretty complicated, and the nuance is hard to understand if you are not American. Although I am American, I myself am white, and I have had to immerse myself in different communities and to read and listen to the stories and history of our country in order to pick up on additional nuances of the situation, but there is still much that we as Americans are aware of regarding our race issues that is ""obvious"" to us but very foreign and bizarre to non-Americans. 

I have friends from countries all over the world (all different continents) and race issues in America are very confusing regardless of whether a person is from Europe, Africa, or Asia. We Americans grow up knowing our history and being taught it, but I don't know how much of that you're exposed to. Just know that it goes *way* beyond a sense of nationalism/patriotism. In fact, a Balkan friend of mine was explaining that where he is from, there isn't ""racism"" like there is in America, but discrimination that is based on a sense of nationalism, so if the attitudes are more nationalism-based where you live, I see how your assumption/theory would be most intuitive to you. 

As I said, though, the ""nationalism"" theory is off target. Racism has a different flavor in the US, and I have no doubt (based on my interaction with non-Americans) that it would seem extremely weird, bizarre, and foreign to you."

If you mean employers, I'd say yes. You will have disadvantages. A significant part of the advantage a college degree brings is that it signals that you have specific *specialized* skills and knowledge. I've personally noticed that the more general the degree, the more challenging it is for people to find work. 

I have a music degree, which (clueless) people say is ""useless,"" but I had no trouble at all finding work because I had a specialization. If you are an employer looking for someone with a specific set of skills and knowledge, you will always choose someone with the appropriate specialization over someone with a ""general"" degree.

There also, I think, may be a bias or stigma against a general degree because it implies that someone either couldn't hack it in a specialized path or simply weren't willing to follow through. Very few people choose a ""general"" degree from the beginning (which itself looks bad, because it indicates some level of not planning ahead or being directionless). Being able to follow through with things is a positive indicator to employers, as is having direction. They want to know that you know what you're doing and can see a project through. They will want to know why you ""gave up"" on your original major.

Even psychology and neuroscience, which are the better degrees, typically require a graduate level education before you can really land a ""good"" job (although there may be some positions in the business/office world that you can get with just a basic psychology or general degree). I fear that you may be shooting yourself in the foot, though, with a general degree. What if you want to get a graduate degree some time down the road? Will the general degree hurt you (I don't actually know the answer to that one).

I want to add, in addition to what I said yesterday, that if you are aiming for ivy tier schools (like Columbia) you really should be challenging yourself with tough AP classes and getting A's in them. I don't want to be a pain in the ass and harp on the ""I don't want to take classes I don't need"" statement, but this attitude is a *serious* turn-off for ivies. They usually look for the ""best of the best,"" and the ""best of the best"" tend to have broad interests and tend to be willing to challenge themselves in areas that they might be less comfortable in. Grade inflation in high school is so high in 2020 that grades alone are not enough to get into a school like Columbia. There are way more students with top grades than there are spots at these schools, so you have to distinguish yourself in additional ways, and one of the ways that students tend to distinguish themselves is to, quite bluntly, take as many AP's as humanly possible and then get A's in them.

I'm not saying this is a good idea or even healthy, but I think you need to have a realistic idea of what you're up against. If this seems a bit much, that's okay. I think being focused on your end goal is fine and that if you want to pick and choose only relevant classes that is a perfectly okay choice and that you'll still have a realistic shot at some really, really good schools that are top schools but maybe not quite ivy tier.  

Honestly, there are many great schools in the northeast, and to start you might just want to check out any school ranked in the top 100. Ranking certainly isn't gospel, but it's a reasonable guide to use absent of any other information about quality. Most people use US News to check rankings.

I say this because I've found that having strong writing skills has served me well again and again in my life, and because despite the pain that my teachers put me through, rising to their expectations has paid off. Whether we like it or not, strong written communication skills signal to others that we are ""smart"" and ""well educated."" If you write well, you will undoubtedly be treated better by others (professors, employers, coworkers, colleagues, peers, etc.). It's not a conscious thing, I don't think. It's just that strong writing skills give others more confidence in your competence in other areas. While many people are great at some things and bad at others, there is a very real general tendency for people who are good at some things to be good at other things. In other words, being a strong writer really is a low-key signal that you are a person worth hiring and a person who can be trusted to do a job correctly.

Full disclosure: I'm not nor have I ever been on admission committee, and I'm getting a graduate degree in statistics, so I'd probably be quicker to throw out an app with low quant scores than other people. It's quite possible that a real life MPH admissions committee would be more forgiving. Still, they're going to want someone who can succeed in their courses, and a 142 in quant is certainly a red flag."
AskAcademia,fetvkjb,t3_eqb7mt,1579380512.0,"I am in my late '20s and plan on a career in research. However, I am a career changer. I have an undergraduate degree in music, and I was a musician and music teacher before pivoting to my new path. 

Obviously you're still a kid, so your situation is different than mine, but my background has allowed me to get a good ""feel"" for how the act of being a musician is viewed by academics. 

> academic: How does the students achievement rank among that of their peers? with five options: top 5%, top 10%, top 15%, top 20%, and top 25%

Something that might not be lost on admissions is that those who are good at one thing tend to be good at other things. I went to a competitive music school that was housed in a mediocre university. There was an odd but noticeable tendency for students in the music department to be stronger than STEM majors at this school in general academic subjects. The music school I went to didn't pay much attention to academic achievement when admitting students, yet the average SAT scores within the music department were higher than the SAT scores among students in many of the more academic departments. 

Why was this? Because the best musicians are very often the best students. That's not coincidence. Being a good musician requires a strong work ethic and a reasonable aptitude (reading music and understanding music theory can be a cognitively demanding task for some people). These traits, not so surprisingly, transfer over to other areas of study as well. 

If you are in the top 5% of musicians at your school, it definitely signals something positive about you. 

> 5 more criterion (Cooperation, Initiative, Enthusiasm, Creativity, Responsibility) marked out of 5

This is where you can really get ahead with a recommendation from a music teacher. Because of the nature of music, your music teacher can probably speak in detail to how you have demonstrated these traits. Some of these traits don't show up quite as easily in other academic contexts.

> A Further Comments section, AKA how this student would be successful in a research environment, as well as what skills may still require further development.

Your band director might not be that familiar with research environments, because it is not typical for musicians to have research experience. Because of this, you may want to discuss with your band director what sort of traits a research environment might be looking for, so he has an idea of how he might want to word his recommendation. 

I'll be honest-- I have no idea what a research internship would expect from a high schooler. However, in general, there are certain traits that I think would reflect very well on a person interested in research. First is personal responsibility. Do you always show up on time and get your shit done, even when no one is breathing down your neck about it? There are many young people who will flake out the moment no one is holding them responsible. You need to be the sort of person who does what they need to do, even when no one is watching.

Next is the ability to work independently. Do you need someone there to hold your hand when you are learning something new, or can you work things out on your own? There are many honors students who do great in school because they have great teachers, helpful parents, and access to tutors, but if you left them alone in a room with just a textbook and google, they wouldn't know where to start. This ability to learn independently is an important life skill, and is extremely important in research, since you're often exploring areas that not many people in your immediate vicinity can help you with, so you'll need to be able to learn about something just from reading up on it on your own. 

Lastly, I'd say that character is important. No one wants to work with a jerk, but there are many jerks all over the place. You seem to be a reasonably decent and professional human being, so you should be fine on this end. Be sure to be humble. Research internships are not common among high school students, and the fact that you are even considering this opportunity indicates that there is a very high chance that you're from a high socioeconomic background. Be mindful of what a privilege that having an opportunity such as this would be. 

To respond to u/Zdawg1202 (in the post you made in r/ApplyingToCollege), I have to say I disagree that you should use a math/science teacher. Presumably, you'll include your transcript on this application, yes? If so, then your grades will speak for themselves. A's in math and science classes will be more than enough to indicate that you are strong in that area. What you need is someone to speak about who you are as a person. Can you handle an environment that has more adult expectations? If you have a math or science teacher who can answer important questions about the quality of your character and your ability to rise up to challenges and to be the responsible and independent worker that you need to be, then ask a math or science teacher. But if you music teacher is the person who can best discuss your most positive traits, then ask your music teacher.

In the end, you need to ask for a recommendation from the individual who can give you the *best* recommendation."

I've heard that it's really tough getting a job with an MPH (master's in public health), and that's a *masters*, so I'd stay away from public health. 

I don't know much about the other two you mentioned. I will say in general that most careers that have to do with ""child and family services"" have good job prospects but low pay. On the flip side, I'd guess that something a bit more niche and ""business-y"" like Fashion Merchandising would be more likely to have bad job prospects but decent pay (as in, it can probably be a good career *if* you can get your foot in the door, which will probably be tough). 

This is all conjecture, though. Do some research on these careers and decide what you value in a career. Pay? Stability? The ability to help others? Creativity? Knowing what you value most will help you make decisions that are more suited to what is a good fit.

Also talk to people in your desired careers, and ask them what they'd recommend you major in. For example, I'm a musician, and I recommend that every person who wants a career as a performing musician major in music education (rather than music performance) because then you have a ""back-up"" in case you can't get work as a performing musician. Teachers can get hired to perform, but performers can't get hired as teachers without the proper credentials, so the better choice is obvious.

I'm one of the people playing devil's advocate on this thread and saying that the student's culture should be taken into account. I am dissapointed, overall, in two things that I have seen repeatedly on this thread:

1) The number of people who haven't noticed that you said that these two bribes happened around the same time (implying that the student never had a ""second chance""-- many on this thread seem to think that the student already had a ""chance"" to learn), and

2) The number of people who seem to ""know"" that bribery is considered unacceptable everywhere in the world. I don't buy it. 

Because of the latter, my suggestion to you is to, if you can find one, go to a subreddit or forum where individuals from your student's native culture congregate and ask them about the situation. I know that we have r/askanamerican, so maybe you can find something analogous from the student's culture. Also see if you can find people on your campus who are from or are well-versed in your student's native culture.

The reality is that it is hard for us Americans to place ourselves in the student's shoes. Some people don't believe that the background of the student should matter when doling out consequences, which is fine. But that is a belief, and a belief that I disagree with. However, I'd like to push back on anyone who *assumes* that the student is aware the egregiousness of his actions. We are not the student. Some students might take advantage of the willingness of people like me to take into account cultural differences, and I do believe we need to be mindful of this-- I'm not an idiot. But expulsion is a very serious consequence. I don't think that it is a decision that should be made lightly.

These youtube ""personalities"" are only a small subset of the population of people who are successful in the business world, and there are people who are successful who don't fit the stereotype. Off of the top of my head, I'm thinking of Tom Steyer, who is an American businessman/billionaire who is running for president as a democrat in the US. He certainly *seems* to be about a lot more than ""hot muscles"" and ""women."" For what it's worth, his platform seems to be decidedly pro-environment and anti-corporate, which again is very much *not* the stereotype for businessmen.

There are many other businessmen I'm sure that are more like you, too. That being said, stereotypes exist for a reason, and I think you are right to question the sort of environment you want to be in for your career. I say this as someone who is changing careers. I was a musician and a music teacher. The reality is that I *like* it, and I love the people who are in that field (so I certainly didn't have issues with personalities like you do), but I'm an introvert and what I was doing was a career that is a great career for people who are extroverts and need to be interacting with people all the time. I had a good job that was a bad ""fit"" for me. In fact, I'm pretty sure I had a job that many people would have loved, but it just wasn't ""me.""

You should consider if being a businessman is a good ""fit"" for you (as you are doing). What will the day to day practice of your target job be like? Will you actually *like* it? *Can* you tolerate the sort of people you'll be surrounded by? Again, stereotypes *do* exist for a reason, and I'm not afraid to admit that most of the questionable personalities I've met in my life have been in business.

That being said, you have options. I don't think it's too late to switch to economics. I made the switch from music to statistics. I'm in my late 20's and haven't finished a graduate degree yet, but I'm getting there and so can you. 

It seems that from this post, a more academic field might be a better fit for you. You seem like more of a ""thinker,"" and (at least in the US-- I don't know how the market is where you are) you can probably go farther with a graduate degree in something quantitative like economics than with a more traditional business degrees.  

I will say that as someone switching to statistics, it might be an area that you'll want to consider as well. I love the field partially because of it's applications to, well, just about everything. Econometrics is it's own field (it's basically the study of statistics as applied to economics), but you can apply statistics to psychology (psychometrics), medicine (biostatistics), or politics (don't know if there's a name for it, but check out the stuff that people like Nate Silver and Andrew Gelman do).

The point is, I relate to your sentiments about being interested in all sorts of field, and I successfully found satisfaction in a different field that allows me to engage thoughtfully in different areas. It might not be for you, of course, but you might want to give it some thought. I'd argue that here in the US, at least, a statistics degree (at the graduate level, at least) is *much* more employable than a business degree. There is nothing superficial about it. You get to *think*, and you get to use it to better understand the world around you.

I think the student being foreign is worth considering, though. The egregiousness of the situation should be obvious to any student raised in the USA. However, bribery is simply not seen as being anywhere near as bad in some cultures. This is to say that the student might only understand it as ""only"" being as bad as any other type of cheating. 

If the student is from one of these cultures, I think that there is an argument to be made that OP's student deserves the opportunity to take it as a learning experience rather than to be expelled on the spot. Note that OP mentioned that both bribery incidents happened around the same time, meaning that the student never had a chance to ""learn"" from the experience. 

*If* OP's student does this again *after* being warned, then expulsion is reasonable. But context matters. Being in a new culture isn't easy as it is. I'm reminded of a story from some (American) kid who got into trouble for piracy when he was in Germany, I think. We as Americans don't view piracy as all that an egregious a crime, so the kid was quite taken aback when he learned that it is very much seen as ""not okay"" by the new culture in which he was immersing himself.

Given the nature of the circumstances, I think there's a good chance that OP's student needs to have a lesson on ""when in Rome, do as Romans do."" In other words, this is not necessarily an issue of OP's student actively choosing to do something that he knows is egregious. Even if OP's student knows it's wrong, he might not now quite *how* wrong it's viewed as by Americans. Thus there needs to be a punishment that sends a clear message to the student that yes, Americans *do* take this seriously, but does not penalize the student as if he knew how ""bad"" his actions were.

college,feo0ly6,t3_eq4060,1579293542.0,I don't see why not. It seems that the upside is that you'll get a more in depth education in what you're most interested in. What's the downside?
Professors,fen9r4o,t1_fen8oks,1579280049.0,"I'll be honest-- I think that the actual outcomes of ""free college"" legislation would depend heavily on the actual nuances and ""strings attached"" that would come with the legislation, and these nuances are rarely talked about. It's like when Trump said ""nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated."" Anyone who knows even the slightest thing about the college system (or healthcare system) knows that it *is* complicated, and that the devil is in the details. 

I suspect that there is a way to write ""free college"" legislation that would minimize the consequences that you're concerned about, but it would be tough, and it would be complicated (just as healthcare is). I'm not sure I'm on board with your suggestion, but I do feel that we need to do *something*.

Of course, much of the *root* of problems are at the k-12 level, so there is an argument to be made that maybe tied into the ""free college"" plans should be some changes made in k-12 (which is probably unrealistic, but it is worth suggesting). 

And then there's the fact that the root of the k-12 problem are poverty and systemic inequities, which are issues that are even tougher to address. 

When we look at it from that perspective, though, ""free college"" becomes another band-aid that may or may not alleviate the underlying problems."

Is data science the *only* industry role that you'd think you'd be able to land? Do you think you'd be able to or willing to extend your job search to other quantitative roles in industry outside of data science? If your PhD is in statistics, you might be able to land a research-based role in government or pharma, which might be more palatable to you than ""data science."""
Professors,fen2o80,t1_femlg4w,1579275627.0,"While I think that the problem you speak of is somewhat widespread, I also don't think it's as ubiquitous as you imagine. I don't know what sort of institution you work at, but I'm most familiar with three institutions. Two of these schools are 4-year public schools and one is a community college. All of these schools target and serve a low-income population, with the community college serving almost entirely at-risk students and the public schools serving more mixed demographics. 

Public school#1 is in the situation you describe. I am concerned about the quality of students that they are graduating. 

The community college is, for lack of a better word, a clusterfuck. In fact, that's an understatement. There are extreme political and ideological rifts within the school (as well as corruption and incompetence within the administration). Nearly everyone entering the school is *well* below college level, and graduation rates are in the single digit range. Higher ups want to get graduation rates up, and they don't seem to care much about whether students graduate with the actual skills that their degrees are meant to certify. The tenured professors dig their heels in the sand and say ""no,"" while the adjuncts who are hanging on by a thread give in. It is a toxic work environment, to say the least, and I think the tenured profs do a solid job keeping standards high, but the work is as mentally draining as you'd expect and fail rates in the 90%+ range in some classes is far from unheard of (which certain administrators blame on professors, but I also observe enough of a united front among professors that the professors can maintain *some* vague sense of sanity). The chaos at this school is almost too much to describe, but it is a good example of institution made up of almost entirely of at-risk students.

Public school #2 admits anyone with a pulse, but also doesn't seem to care in the slightest about whether or not students *pass* the classes. In fact, I have word that some years ago there was significant pressure on professors to err in the direction of grade deflation. The school appears to be focusing on improving it's ""rank"" among commonly used lists (which might not be the *best* way to do things, but it's far from the worst thing a school could strive for). What I observe at this particular school is high admittance rates, but also high failure rates in first year courses. I've also noticed that they seem to push some of their weaker students to transfer into Clusterfuck Community College, who then fail out of Clusterfuck CC rather than their own school. I don't condone this, necessarily, but the reality is that Clusterfuck CC offers remedial classes that this public school doesn't offer and that these students need, so to some extent, it is the only reasonable option that the public school #2 can take (other than, you know, *not* admitting unqualified students...).

However, I've heard nothing but good things about the quality of Public School #2's graduates and the quality of education given to the students at this school. It seems to take more of the sink or swim attitude, which might not be the worst approach as long as the students who are going to sink do it early on before too much has been invested in them. There are some students who come into this school at a high school level, and they do offer remedial courses targeted at these students and I have seen some success with these students. 

The students at middle school and elementary school level seem to mostly be stuck at Clusterfuck CC, and while success rates are low, I do see enough of those heartwarming ""success against all odds"" stories that I find myself to be a cheerleader for these opportunities. Some people who are in shitty situations and who have a weak academic background really are meant for highly academic paths, and it the idea of preventing opportunities for these students really pains me. 

There needs to be more gatekeeping, yes, but I think what it comes down to is offering appropriate remedial level classes and then failing the students who deserve to fail. Some schools hesitate to actual fail students, and that's where we're going wrong. 

Sure, not everyone is ""college material,"" but we need to give them a chance. We need to not be afraid to have high standards and we need to fail the students who are not capable of adequate work, and if their GPA dips too low, we need to be able to say ""goodbye"" and maybe tell them to try again in 5 or so years if they feel they're ready.

What I just wrote is already par for the standards at most places-- the only change is that I want schools to *actually* maintain high standards. Basically, we need to ditch the grade inflation. Obviously in practice this would be tough, but maybe it wouldn't be so tough is the taxpayer rather than the students were paying? To be fair, it often already *is* the taxpayer that's paying to some extent (many students have federal grants), but with free college the public will likely have more of a negative sentiment towards the ""everyone passes"" approach that seems to exist at many schools. 

> If anything, I'd like to see trade schools and votech schools become free first, or alongside, in these proposals.

I do agree with this, and I do agree that not everyone is ""college material."" In my experience, though, many poor kids or wealthy but abused or neglected kids who *are* college material get lumped into the ""not college material"" pile just because of bad situations in their early lives. 

I think there needs to be a cultural shift in the ""everyone needs college"" attitude, though. The students who are in college but don't want to be there know who they are. We need to be able to get it into their heads that it's okay for them to leave and to live their lives in a way that is more fulfilling for them, and we need to make sure that they know that there are financially viable options outside of college. I don't see this happening, though, and that's a problem."
