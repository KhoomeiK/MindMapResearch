modernwarfare,fffxu2j,t3_etcrps,1579894162.0,"This is them trying to take advantage of mtx and people not knowing what gun they're buying stuff for so easily.

How do I know?

1. The game used to say the actual gun until the very first patch that brought in mtx and they changed it

2. As others have stated, IW is not fixing it"

modernwarfare,ffcgxh4,t3_esnp05,1579799222.0,"Hey IW, what did you learn from this? Riddle us that.


Here's what I learned, your QA team if you even have one to begin with is **definitely** ass (plenty of examples have proven it but this guarantees it). Test your fucking updates before releasing them, otherwise I guarantee you'll be embarrassed about your product if you're not already. Jesus developers really suck today."

Edit: I plan to replace it with a Noctua NH-D15 air cooler"

overclocking,ff0c6hu,t1_fezh8my,1579467531.0,"Thanks for your response. I'm really thinking I have to check my thermal paste application (first time I apply it myself on this build I made) because as I'm trying to OC the CPU and stress, just on idle it's running at 70+C with my H100i cooler. Other similar setups I've seen online say idle is running 20s to 40sC."

overclocking,fewisdj,t3_e7nwj0,1579411387.0,Do you have your CPU over locked by chance? Looking for setting examples of OC to try on my 9900K installed on Maximus XI Hero since I'm a huge amateur at this except knowing how to copy settings
