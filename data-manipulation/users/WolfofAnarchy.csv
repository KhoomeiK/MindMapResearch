>As for immigration I think homogenization in the U.S is absolutely impossible barring massive genocides or deportations on a scale to dwarf Nazi Germany, the USSR, or the PRC.

Don't get me wrong I don't want to remove the blacks or anybody who's there already right now (unless they're illegal), hahaha. And yeah America is already too far gone in that aspect. I don't think it's unamerican though, until 1965 America was largely homogeneous, with 2 ethnicities and relations were quickly getting better after Kennedy was elected and the years after that. Unfortunately in 1965 the Hart-Celler immigration act was passed which the vast majority of Americans were against, and it allowed mass migration to start, which we still see today.

>Deurbanization is something I would love for more people to talk about especially since I think the right and left can come together on it.

I think so, too. Because the vast majority (those who don't scream on Reddit and Twitter) does appreciate having tight bonds with communities.

>The left can see it as environmental and the right can see it as an independent sort of thing?

I guess!

>I'm curious as to what right wing social views you hold? To me the first things I think of are Abortion, Cannabis, Gay Marriage, and Guns.

Yes, those + immigration. That one's mainly because I've lived in Japan and other ethnically homogeneous countries and I believe that when you really get down to it immigration is something we should ask *Why?* about and not *Why not?* 

I don't have any problems with cannabis though. Also I'm a *huge* proponent of background checks and common sense gun control, but I would only ever vote for it if I knew 100% that the government would keep it at that and wouldn't push further than that, which is unfortunately impossible!

But really there's a few issues that are incredibly important to me, more than any other:

* Environment, I sometimes classify myself as an eco-authoritarian, meaning the government should, as of yesterday, immediately get highly involved in prohibiting throwaway plastics, should sanction countries that can't keep their waters clean, should triple the fines for littering, should *massively* raise taxes on and/or punish corporations that are polluting our precious planet.
* De-urbanization. That's the traditionalism speaking - I feel that people should again see the beauty in and appreciate small communities and being in touch with one another and living in more harmony with nature.
* LGBT issues - even though my very best friend is gay and I'd die for him, I always tell him this - I am for acceptation but not for embracing, which is what's happening now and knowing how susceptible I was to all media influence as a small kid, and seeing what's happening with <15y/o's today, it scares me.
* Immigration. Just not a fan, diversity is when you have 500 countries on earth, all with things that make them different and unique, not when you have 500 countries of which 80% are the same hellscape I described above of just mixed people who don't look like each other. (Note: I do appreciate other cultures and ethinicities heavily, it's why I've lived in 3 countries in the last 2 years).
* Govt > Corporate. This one speaks for itself. If the choice is to be made between power for corporations or for government, I'm going to government 100% of the time.

Hope that clears it up."
conspiracy,ffd2v7r,t1_ffd0m8j,1579812336.0,"I definitely get where you're coming from. I'm a right-wing traditionalist you could say socially and culturally speaking, but economically I'm far-left. I'm also no fan of democracy, because after a while it tends to produce a broken system that can't effectively solve root problems that need more than a one-side solution (more than one of these: judicial, political, cultural, economical), which is often impossible in our systems.

I feel that the damage has already been done, it's only downhill from now socio-culturally, but I believe it's been going down since the 1960s in that regard, pretty much anything that happened in that area after that has made the population more divided, unhappy and has hurt and derailed the family unit, which is the basis of a strong nation, IMO.
