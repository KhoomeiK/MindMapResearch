Just watched a great [video](https://youtu.be/AaktzUQsIkE) on the company. 

We don't have ALDI in my area, but we do have Trader Joe's, which is owned by ALDI. Is ALDI cheaper than TJ's?  I ask because, aside from dairy (which is always cheaper at TJ's) I don't notice a dramatic difference between the prices there and those at Lucky or Safeway. Sure, they're a little less expensive than full-priced items at the supermarket, but half the price."

I've felt sad before, but nothing compares to how that shit would hit me a couple of days after taking it. It felt like I had mortgaged all my joy and I'd never feel anything good ever again.
