dbz,fgajoxi,t3_exhvfu,1580652100.0,"1. DBZ for that Z fighter squad, Super Saiyan, power ups and more usage of ki blast/flight.

DCcomics,fg72aap,t3_ex8f2q,1580582318.0,"I think HIC could’ve been great, but the problem was that King did not choose his 3 main characters. Editorial did. 

With that, it makes this book have a bad taste because why would you take one of the most beloved characters in the DCU and just ruin him like that? All so that Harley could now be verified as a good person? That could’ve been done in another way. 

If King gave them both characters and the story instead of just story, I’m sure HIC would’ve been a bit better received."

DCcomics,ffztfh3,t1_ffzqmun,1580392381.0,"Np! Thats why he doesn’t really plan in depth beyond 4-5 issues. He has thoughts, but doesn’t plan it out till deadline gets closer."
DCcomics,ffzpnsf,t1_ffzoym8,1580389148.0,"Yeah Lobdell talked about how with this run and even his N52 run he just does whatever editorial wants and grows the story from there.
