and my comment telling you to stop trying to convince me to not throw puppies off of bridges.

The comparison is that paying for someone to breed(forcibly) an animal to be abused and then killed, just so you can eat their flesh, is animal abuse in the same way that throwing puppies off of bridges is animal abuse.

The comparison is that paying for someone to breed(forcibly) an animal to be abused and then killed, just so you can eat their flesh, is animal abuse in the same way that throwing puppies off of bridges is animal abuse.
