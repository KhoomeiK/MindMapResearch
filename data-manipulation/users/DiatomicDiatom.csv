The thing is, I'm very frugal and I spend no more than $100 on groceries a month, which is way less than average. I shop sales, buy in bulk, shop in season, etc. When I was in my early 20s I ate really unhealthy and was spending $250 a month on groceries."
vegan,ffi8hcg,t1_ffh6frb,1579967810.0,I have. Gardein makes the best stuff but it's pretty expensive. I think beefless grounds are the easiest to get right in terms of vegan fake meats. I only bought these grounds because I had a free coupon.

I let the synergy one sit at room temperature for a week. Sure enough, the cap was bubbled up and it exploded when opened. So it's still the same but I think they put less time into the 2nd ferment, hence the high sugar content."
