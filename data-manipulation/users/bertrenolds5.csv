TwoXChromosomes,ff6n1qa,t1_ff6cfyl,1579630689.0,"That's americans pushing their religious beliefs on the entire country for ya. It's crazy a group that thinks dinosaurs didn't exist and the earth is only 10,000 years old could have so much power to force their beliefs on everyone else."
TwoXChromosomes,ff6mhr6,t1_ff6bonr,1579630354.0,"Sorry, It's tough having very religious family and you yourself not buying all the bs of religion."
TwoXChromosomes,ff6mclk,t1_ff69i6f,1579630267.0,"A perfect example of it working. Instead in the us we get no education on sex and no easy access to contraceptives yet you can't have abortions. And then when a single mother has a child they don't want conservatives cut funding to programs that would support them. Basically you have sex you have to have a child you can't support or even pay the bills to have the child. Religion has made this country so ass backwards, what happened to seperation of church and state?"

Documentaries,ff3wjj6,t1_ff387pp,1579550399.0,I'm glad you pointed out that bmi can be misleading and in accurate. Im a big tall muscular guy and for my height they say my ideal weight is less than 200lbs but if I actually listened to that advice and was at my bmi's weight I would be unhealthy and way to thin.

They had to demolish a house on the show it was so bad. There are good reasons hoa's exist, not all of them are shitty. While I don't agree with all of my hoa's rules I can try to get on the board and push for change."

todayilearned,fegzjjj,t1_fegwfhp,1579105994.0,Yea but it cycles your blood and is more prone to problems or atleast in my situation. Trust me I wanna do it but I'm not dealing with that stupid machine and messing up my veins anymore.
todayilearned,fegzag9,t1_fegr5ol,1579105838.0,"I have a rare blood type and they always ask me to do a double and as much as I wanna do it I have had to many bad experiences with that damn machine from back in college donating plasma and them putting a needle thru my vein to recently doing the same and having my vein blow up like a baloon. I will keep donating due to high iron and rare blood type but from now on I will only do the old school gravity donation, no more machines, fuk that."

Futurology,fe6hm5p,t1_fe6dr3h,1578891158.0,Um your idea doesn't check out. Minimum wage needs to be adjusted with inflation. The reason cost of living is so high is because inflation keeps pushing the price of everything up yet minimum wage stays the same. Did you know that a little over 40 years ago minimum wage when adjusted for inflation was about $12. Now 40+ years later people are making almost half of that. Do you not see an issue with this?

Our awesome team left and won a cup for fuking dallas, a state you can't even play hockey outside during the winter in. Our state is cursed! Best we ever had were the twins, wild and Vikings are nothing but a disappointment year after year."

nottheonion,fdf4rxc,t1_fdepp3w,1578353296.0,Bushes economy? He pushed trickle down economics which is complete bs and used spending on wars to stimulate the economy which did nothing. Obama raised corporate taxes and made billionaires pay their fare share in taxes and the result was more govt spending that trickled down into the little guys wallets further stimulating the economy.
worldnews,fdex7h8,t1_fdep2r8,1578348498.0,"Ah education needs it the most, schools have been underfunded for decades because of Republicans and classes are extremely over crowded! It 100% starts with good education at a young age! Obviously you can't educate older people who are already behind but we can sure as hell make sure future generations can compete against other better educated countries. Do you realize where the us currently ranks in the world for education?"
worldnews,fddrdb9,t1_fdddd9t,1578321972.0,Chenney and bush said saddam had wmd's not that he may get them. That is why we went there. Also said they were involved in 911.
worldnews,fddqnbc,t1_fddo4n2,1578321399.0,I think we need actual proof he was there on a diplomatic mission. What everyone is being told is that he was there to plot attacks.
worldnews,fdctl2y,t1_fdcrc7o,1578283931.0,Yes and everyone was misled about wmd's and Iraq's involvement in 911.
Futurology,fda0eoz,t1_fd7ok3z,1578240277.0,Atleast the conversation of how horrible it is eventually takes over. If it were a total sham and completely manipulated you would never hear it
Futurology,fda00ji,t1_fd753c2,1578240102.0,"I agree, I had a friend delet fb and then get hurt and he can't even see a group that was created to update everyone on his status. If anything he in now less informed. Facebook can be good if you use it for the right reasons like staying connected with friends. The political shit posting on the other hand is disturbing and the adds are fuking annoying. And when you comment the add is for a knock off product you can get on Amazon for cheaper the seller delets your post and blocks you."
Futurology,fd9z9fn,t1_fd6qwkr,1578239802.0,I bet your conservative so of course you think a liberal leaning site is biased because it doesn't fit your narrative all the time. Please post actual proof reddit is biased otherwise your just sharing your opinion and in turn being biased yourself. I think reddit as a whole is pretty open minded and things most people would like do infact make it to the front page and get equal educated discussion.
Futurology,fd9y9je,t1_fd5tfy6,1578239496.0,Why? Just use it to communicate with a large group of your friends if you wanna share something. Avoid the stupid adds and the dumb political shit posting and your good. There are plenty of fb groups where you can communicate with people directly that have a welth of knowledge that can help you. A specific example would be a fb group for a specific vehicle and fixing and modding it
Futurology,fd9xnvx,t1_fd9f50y,1578239242.0,Well with lack of funding comes making curriculum watered down as fuk. Glad I went to school before it really went down hill in the last 2 decades. Now class sizes are so big you can't teach
Futurology,fd9ws9z,t1_fd7xzt6,1578238967.0,"Right, the players either knew each other or were part of the same group and watched a video like you posted"
Futurology,fd9wcyh,t1_fd9c4nx,1578238791.0,Stories that are important still make it to the front page in news. While reddit is a bit liberal leaning I think there is plenty of fair conversation on here.

worldnews,fcwhgyi,t1_fcwc7ek,1578025735.0,"We spend more on our military than anything else and by a long shot. Imagine if we invested that much in education and healthcare and infrastructure. Our country is falling apart! Oh but war is good because it lines the pockets of special intrests and boosts the economy. Dude we can't keep spending money we don't have on our military and never ending wars, there wont be anything left for the people of the United states."

Documentaries,fc4ur3z,t1_fc4svxn,1577429208.0,"Yea but you get free healthcare and education, we in the usa just get the shaft. Imagine if you also had student loan debt you will pay for the rest of your life or a huge medical bill from an accident your gonna pay forever, things wouldn't be so great."
Documentaries,fc4uoek,t1_fc4qhk0,1577429122.0,It starts with minimum wage being reflective of inflation. Inflation keeps rising while jobs still pay the same. At this point when we get raises we just keep making the same amount of money as when we started 3 years ago. I like to call my yearly 3% raise my inflation raise.
hockey,fc21mqo,t1_fc1vnpz,1577336867.0,"The only good movies she has been in are pitch purfect movies, that noelle movie looks horrible. I keep seeing adds for it on Disney+. Otherwise she has a chip contract and a hotel contract."
