Thank you. I've worked hard to become so.

I admit it. You are better than I am.

Then why are you smiling?

Because I know something you don't know.

And what is that?

ShittyRestrictionFood,ff99gxh,t1_ff8ealq,1579707908.0,Was the oat fiber white or a tan color? I think there's two different kinds the white is a light flavorless pulp. The tan is gritty and tastes bad.

fatlogic,feduw69,t1_feb74bp,1579020407.0,It's the same with running. Running with muscle is harder than  running while skinny but running while fat is like running on sand. It's also like bouncing a basketball that's low on air.
