fantasywriters,ff4lgfk,t1_ff3m3lf,1579566475.0,"I don’t got the whole language road but I do keep track of the sounds I use for names in different cultures.  So I list all the sounds I’ve used and all the ones I don’t what the language to have so that when I make up new places and characters I can use that to guide me.  So say the name that I came up with by feel is Pilio but I’ve decided the language doesn’t have the P sound I change it to Bilio.

This helps connect unrelated names.  So even if the words you have already chosen to be used in Juppa don’t sound super related, any new words you make up will because they take parts from the names you already have.  

Not sure if I explained this right but this worked really well for me to help make different languages distinct yet consistent without having to go to the effort of making a conlang.  

Also I feel you on having names that are hard to change even if they don’t quite fit - I have a character called Mackenzie."

Fantasy,felxc98,t3_epsfpc,1579233306.0,"I would say realm of the elderlings starting with assassins apprentice by robin hobb would probably be my top recommendation based on what you’ve read.

 I would say we have similar tastes, I’ve read all of those on your list except the stand and lotr, and they are among my favourites.  Including not being big on eye or the world.

I would also recommend the discworld books by Terry prattchet - similar humour to hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and actually ticks off the things you like quite well even if it is more comedic.  

This one is historical not fantasy but I would recommend the accursed kings by Maurice Droun.  It is about events leading up to the Hundred Years War.   It’s similar to asoiaf and the first law.

Another one is the Moontide Quartet by David Hair.  Good character development and intertwining plot points.  Had a bit of a slow beginning but I got into it.

I’ll also throw in the Gone series by Micheal Grant.  Basically in a town everyone over 15 disappears and everyone under 15 is stuck in bubble surrounding the town.  Some of the kids start developing mutations as well as plants and animals.  Lots of interesting complicated characters and stories, no plot amour.  Great character development - good characters become bad, bad becomes good,  lazy characters become hardworking and motivated charters lose the plot ect."
