Wellthatsucks,fg601zx,t1_fg5u3ko,1580546636.0,"I've always been prone to have an upset stomach very randomly. Especially when anxious or stressed like going out to dinner with families or eating big meals over holidays. I would be honest, say my stomach is upset, I'm just gonna eat a piece of bread or a roll, drink some water, etc. Tell them you have an issue, and you're already trying to make it better. They generally leave me alone about it, but I'm not excluded from any activities or family events. Just my 2 cents."

MakeMeSuffer,fetve0s,t1_fetg9gm,1579380443.0,"Absolutely. I've worked closely with a number of vets while rescuing animals. Majority of vets charged exorbitant amounts for unnecessary tests and procedures. Once we found a good vet that discussed treatments and options and pricing and everything we stuck with that vet like glue. Definitely shop around for a good vet before sticking with one. Not to say all vets are bad, some are just older with out of date knowledge that refuse to learn. Or teach the next generation this same knowledge."
lotrmemes,felznid,t1_felwvee,1579235129.0,"I'm listening to the Silmarillion on audio book, and yes. It's incredibly dense and the first few chapters are very hard to follow. I've only watched the movies, this was my first time reading/listening to any of the story, so I don't know a whole lot about the lore. A lot of names that are unfamiliar to me."
nextfuckinglevel,fejc0km,t1_fejbsde,1579166416.0,"Sometimes winds shift and strengthen, making a fire move much more quickly than anticipated. What was a couple hours time to evacuate can turn into mere minutes. They can also change direction and head towards houses or a town that it was expected to pass by completely, catching people unawares."
Awwducational,fe4l564,t1_fe1etf8,1578860486.0,"Of course, vets are people too and are not infallible. Not all vets are good people. Responsible vets should always inform people of the risks and necessity of any procedure, pushing against any superfluous, unnecessary procedure."

Awwducational,fe0r138,t1_fe0b95l,1578817680.0,"In lot of places, especially rural or under developed, vets prefer to keep it legal because if it's illegal, or the vets refuse, people will do it themselves. And then instead of a relatively simple procedure done in a safe way, they have to treat dogs for botched home surgeries with major infections. It's unfortunately a lesser of two evils."
