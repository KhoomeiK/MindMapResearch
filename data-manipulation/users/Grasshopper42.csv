talesfromtechsupport,fffmlua,t1_fffbd69,1579887216.0,"I had a rich guy that is the VP of sales for Pabst blue ribbon for the whole West coast try to get me to lose my job over some real BS. Of course I had his address and still do, but that heat of the moment goes away and you never actually do anything. if the guy had any brains he would realize that I do have his address and that that was really stupid of him. My dad actually knows the old CEO of Pabst blue ribbon but my dad is a narcissist so he won't help me fuck with this guy. I mean, I had some dude (Jim Wilferling of Portland OR) drug me and raped me and my dad did nothing about it when I told him. He said he would but never did."

talesfromtechsupport,ffflfbf,t1_fff5olr,1579886497.0,"I went on a satellite internet service call and dude was sure his tv was hacked through our router. He actually took the router to his girlfriend's house and left it there out of paranoia, like having it near his tv would cause problems. He had to pay my boss over 100 bucks for me to give him a new router. Our parent company has their supply company hire contracters to hire sub-contractors (technicians) to insulate themselves from any issues caused by their technicians or the install. And since we aren't ""in house employees"" my boss has to buy equipment and gets paid back when he returns it or when the customer takes it on their contract. If he didn't get that router from my boss, then I would jot have been able to complete the service call and would not have gotten paid for going out there. My boss rocks, actually. 


While installing the new router I made sure to be obvious to him that I was taking extra care to keep his password and all other information secret. I mentioned how I was working so that you couldn't see anything through the windows the whole time I was setting it up. I pulled the little sticker with the password off and handed it to him like making a drug deal on the street. He tried texting and calling me later to try to get his money back."
talesfromtechsupport,fffjsw6,t3_et9j8x,1579885488.0,"Narcissistic personality disorder is becoming more and more rampant as far as I can tell. It is partially based around the image they think they are projecting, and mostly their own separate reality that they are living in. It is like they are lost in a waking dream where they are a compassionate caring loving and fair person that is being unfairly taken advantage of by whoever their current target is. Episodes begin when the plan they have set for themselves doesn't go the way they planned. It triggers the ""I was wrong"" section of the brain which for them, triggers a whole other world of ""I can't be wrong the proof is in front of me"" and ""this person is being lazy/stupid/malevolent/ignorant and they need to be told what to do."" They grasp at any interpersonal power to belittle the person that is acting wrong in their eyes. Depending on how deep someone is in their narcissism they can take it really far. 



They tried to take you to court over a normal troubleshooting procedure that would have probably fixed the issue? Did he not understand that a truck roll would probably cost him even if you did agree to it? So dumb but I'll bet that guy isn't dumb, he is just broken inside. Narcissism is fixable but requires a real desire to see the real world and actually understand how other people feel. They have to first care about how they themselves feel to get to that next step of caring about others. It is super sad in a way because someone did that to them to begin with. They showed the narcissist that they are worthless. It doesn't excuse the behavior though."

This is the most ancient story of 2 brothers (not from Rick and Morty): Both brothers were trying to make sacrifices in the present for a better future by working hard on their craft. One was an animal herder and the other a farmer of crops. The brother with the animals really did well in life and was a really nice guy anyways, everyone liked him. The brother with the crops, despite his hard work was continuously poor and grew envious of his brothers successes, so he killed him."
