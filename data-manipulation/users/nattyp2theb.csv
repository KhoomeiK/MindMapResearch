GraceAndFrankie,ffsxxui,t1_ff7d9mj,1580197129.0,Yeah and her fashion was really on point this season!  Super preppy but she put her hair up more often and played with more patterns and colors I though. Loved where the season took herby the end!!

GraceAndFrankie,ffsxrw5,t3_esxovh,1580196917.0,"That liquor store is a landmark LA location and appears in several films and tv shows. It’s in NoHo and probably just has a scene for the hell of it. San Diego is a few hours away from LA alone.  The most memorable appearances for me are Clueless, where Cher gets robbed. Also in Alpha Dog and Spun!"

GraceAndFrankie,ffsxhor,t1_ffsn688,1580196554.0,"There should be two rooms at least, since the two couples bought the beach house...right? Or did they time-share it? The sleepover the kids have at the beach shows at least one of them fills a room, I’d assume a guest room. 

A floor plan would be a cool find!"
GraceAndFrankie,ffsxeay,t1_ffs1znr,1580196434.0,"I really have never understood Bud and Allison. I’m re-watching the whole series now and when she comes into the picture I don’t get it. Like, how is he so far removed from reality that he doesn’t even notice her absurd phobias etc?? However his caring and attentiveness and love toward her is really endearing. Still not sure what either of them (Bud or Allison) are bringing to the show though. And Faith barely exists!"

AmItheAsshole,ffin5c8,t3_ettdbn,1579977872.0,"NTA - tbh I was this girl once. If she can learn to communicate her wants, and how to deal with an answer she doesn’t want to hear, and find ways to  compromise, then there’s hope! I’d give her the benefit of the doubt and hope she isn’t meaning to be manipulative. Just emotionally immature."
