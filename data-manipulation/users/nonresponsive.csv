Holy fuck man."

I remember an NBA game being announced purely by former players.. and it was terrible. Some former players are great, while others not so much. So my expectations are mild until I actually hear em.

Tom and Peyton, and maybe Eli tho would be hilarious."

And that license can easily get revoked for malfeasance. They have a medical board to answer to for the slightest wrongdoing. Just saying there's a lot of hoops to become a doctor. 

A photographer doesn't require a license. They don't even need accreditation. There is no Hippocratic oath to become one. Anyone equating the two as a justification is out of their mind. They are not the same.

I completely agree with you about boundaries, and don't get how people don't understand that."

Then the first thing you respond with after explaining things is, your selfish and wrong, before ever giving them a chance to respond. And then insult their accountant (who they've probably been with for a while), as not just an idiot, but a fucking idiot. And I'm guessing you've never talked with, to maybe see if this is just a misunderstanding. 

And you think they're the ones at fault. Holy shit."

That season was a first, where I turned a game off halfway because of how bad it was. Then I stopped watching a lot of the games. Haven't gotten into the regular season much because of it, and honestly looks like I'm not missing much."
UpliftingNews,ffhch3f,t1_ffh4ph0,1579929833.0,"I mean, we also legalize marijuana comparatively early. And actually being willing to fight price gouging on medicine is huge. 

We have a lot wrong, but this is a pretty big deal. And every step matters."
gadgets,ffgw4et,t1_ffg2i9z,1579916565.0,"I mean, it cost nearly 2000 dollars, it's first generation. A lot of people didn't buy one. The people who did buy it are a very specific demographic. I mean, I know I'm not paying 2k for a phone. But again, it's new tech, aimed at very specific people at this point in time. 

I literally didn't know anyone else who had a HTC Dream, and didn't know anybody with a Surface 1/2 laptop. I had both, even had an original Apple iPod back in the day. But now look at Android phones, look at Surface laptops. Multiple generations in, and they're much more accessible and popular. 

Judging the success of a product based on who you know owns one, or plans to own one is a terrible basis of measurement. And it's also no reason to discourage new technology. These things take time, specifically, multiple generations before catching on to the normal population (usually the 3rd iteration is notable lately). So maybe hold your cynicism for a few years. Also, the technology itself can be important for reasons we do not know, because that's how it usually works."
