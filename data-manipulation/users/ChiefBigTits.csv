But, public perception has so much to do with desire for change, which can help sway lawmakers. The average joe is still likely to believe the anecdote about my cousin who took LSD and permanently believes he’s a glass of orange juice. Even people I’ve spoken to who smoke cannabis a lot, still believe that if you take LSD once, even 100ug, if you crack your back years down the line, you will have flashbacks. I think the way psychedelics are being approached, sometimes very irresponsibly, is what will cause public perception to prevent change from happening. There are some places like Denver that are making waves, though"
4chan,feh5986,t1_feh4i2m,1579109415.0,"Yeah that is pretty fucked up, and I agree it’s not just blacks that this country exploited, just like how Asians were made to build most of our railroads. Hell, even Irish, who I’ve met some Irish people who are VERY racist, were once discriminated against in America. But, in talking to and being friends with black people, the majority don’t want reparations, and some, like us all, don’t give a single fuck about the past. But the couple people I’ve met who are all about treating one race way above another, also use Twitter, and are also very vocal. I think this is a case of whoever is the loudest wins

I would like to add inner city schools are severely underfunded, but so are rural schools in America, so that can’t be just one race.

I don’t trust the court to make an unbiased decision (their bias is towards who has the most $) but you’re right, it would be highly illegal to reverse the decision. But no, you have to paint blacks as a horrible group of people as a whole. The 13/52 stat is the most uninformed, depraved idea with a huge lack of critical thinking I’ve ever heard. I don’t even think you’ll give a shit, as racists usually stay that way until they get their well deserved deaths, but consider how America has been set up. After emancipation, blacks were continually harrased physically and financially, and this is not that long ago, about 100 years. Already, a country is built on the backs of an entire race. But to take it into modern times, notice how much more often black neighborhoods are policed than whites. Police are looking to create revenue and fill quotas, they patrol black neighborhoods a lot more because they are told to. Unbiased crime reportings consistently find there is no racial difference, have you even heard of the UCR, or just your racist friends? Hell, even unconstitutional ways of “fighting crime” like stop and frisk, found no racial difference in who was found carrying drugs or weapons."

But I’ve been a part of multiple instances of police negligence, those close to me have had the same experiences, while living in completely different areas. And despite these instances that frustrate me so much, if I see an officer in a coffee shop, or gas station or the like, I will usually try to say hi and wish them a nice day. Not. Once. Has a cop reciprocated even small talk like that with me. 

I will agree that not all cops can be bad apples. However, these apples have insane amounts of power. If there’s a good apple, and they sit idly while the bad apples keep rotting, are they really a good apple? 

And lastly, we as a society 100% need civil protection. But, I’ve never felt I can rely on the police to protect me, and due to my own biases that I gained from observation, this is true

I picked up on the outside chord that you’re mentioning, F major earlier though! The specific nuance Hendrix (he wrote it but I’m listening to SRV’s nuances as well) used was to add a G instead of the highest F in the chord, which sounds really nice. 

So a better application of changing scales for each chord, would be for a song that has a modal progression or something like that? I see why it makes sense to pretty much stick with Gmaj/Emin for this one, the progression at a base level is very simple and smooth 

Thank you very much though for taking the time my friend, playing songs and actively thinking about specific notes makes me feel like I’m sophisticated lmao"
