monkeyspaw,ff3p3kp,t1_ff3ovdj,1579545815.0,It’s the internet though. There are advertisements for the hotline every so often. It sometimes comes up naturally in conversation. Memes spread its presence. So if it’s so known why is it necessary to comment the number on every single suicide joke. It’s worse than PC people complaining about the jokes and saying that not everything is funny.

memes,fdlet6v,t1_fdl0thr,1578522485.0,"I’m an outlier. I don’t like rogue one it was boring for me and I don’t think I ever wondered how Leia got those plans. Also, Leia not being the one to get those plans downplays her badassness.

I used to think that she was captured because she finally felt it was necessary to come out and face down the empire herself. That the plans were only available to senators or leaders who could be in the sector she received the transmissions and she risked her life and those of her planet to get them.

Now that I know that a couple of random nobodies got the plans who shot them into space during a space battle that was just any normal rebellion battle. It feels like she was an idiot for going out there and getting them herself. She could’ve sent someone else to get them. She didn’t need to be there at all. Her stupidness got Alderaan destroyed."
