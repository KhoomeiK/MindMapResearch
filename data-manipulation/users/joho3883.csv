Like here's my review: 
if you hate musicals, you're gonna hate it. 

If you like musicals, you'll find it bareable. the music is alright. The CGI is not the best, but they worked with what they had. So once you look past the CGI, and focus more on the choreography, set, and music it's a little more enjoyable. At times it was pretty slow. Also it seemed like they just crammed in a shit ton of extra songs just for the hell of it when they weren't necessary. Overall plot isn't great, but I think everyone knew that going in. TAYLOR NEEDED MORE SCREEN TIME SHE GOT 8 MINUTES LIKE WHAT THE FUCK. BUT HER SONG WAS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD!! I've listened to it about 18 times today. She didn't actually get to perform her song that she co-wrote for the movie although it did play during the end credits. the lead of the show was not a great singer or actress. In fact I looked her up and it said ""ballerina"" and she had only been in two other films. I think they probably could have gotten a stronger lead. At times during the show everyone was thinking ""why is this so sexual"" or ""what the actual fuck"" or ""was this worth $10"" or ""this has really a good cast why is it so mehh"" so my overall review is that it's not as bad as people made it, but it was also very long and drawn out"
