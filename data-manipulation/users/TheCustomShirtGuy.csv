Government pays your university costs all up front, then we pay them back gradually through the tax system, and only once we earn over a certain amount each year. So if you graduate and can't find a job, you pay back nothing, it's only when you start earning something like 2x minimum wage, I don't know the exact figure."

dystopia,fczc9ej,t3_ejjs19,1578098021.0,"I like it.
I'm not an editor, but something that my editor really tried to drill into me was pick a single perspective and don't head hop.
This would mean that the 'four shots' may not have been heard across the neighbourhood, because unless this segment is told from the neighbours perspective, how would we know? You could say that the shots rang out across the neighbourhood, though, or rattled the rooftops of nearby houses, etc. It is assumed that they would have been heard by some people, but we can't explicitly say so unless we are telling the story from the perspective of the person who heard.
Also, experiment with a more active writing style. For example, 'the sound of heavy boots could be heard' is a long winded way of wording it, and it doesn't tell us much, such as who is telling the story. Who heard the boots? You could try ""the father flinched as heavy boots hit old wood"" or if it's from the peace-agents perspective, ""The old wood flooring groaned beneath his heavy boots"" or something like that."
