cats,ffgxsx2,t3_etjm14,1579917812.0,One of my cats will only lay on me when I have a blanket on but she'll lay on my husband all day as long as he doesn't move. Silly cats!

creepyPMs,ff6bmai,t3_erhbyu,1579623637.0,That guy is a predator. Chances are he doesn't have a girlfriend but likes the idea of you thinking that he does while he goes behind her back to talk to you. You got caught up in his game. Good job for stepping away and blocking him.
tinyhouse,feek5ab,t1_feebq2j,1579035385.0,Awesome!
tinyhouse,fee2nxo,t3_em1ath,1579025136.0,I don't know if you are going to stain the inside or paint it but I really like the light color of  the wood. Very nice!!!
AmItheAsshole,fee1y4q,t3_eojuzh,1579024705.0,NTA - My dad only went to his father's funeral to make sure the bastard was dead and to piss on his grave. You did good by celebrating by yourself and to yourself without making it known to others. Your sister only knew because she pays too close attention to what you are doing. Don't worry about what she thinks and just know your truth and live your life the best you can without harming others.
lgbt,fdtucd0,t1_fdttypf,1578722336.0,My parents were pretty great at that as well and it makes a huge difference in life. Good job!
lgbt,fdtrc87,t3_en2vov,1578720993.0,It's really great that your daughter is comfortable to talk to you about stuff like that. Keep up the lines of open communication!
AmItheAsshole,fds4s5h,t3_emv42p,1578694345.0,NTA - Your parents need to get a nanny for your two younger brothers with the money they would be spending on a car. You save your money and buy you a car that you want and will be able to keep.
AmItheAsshole,fds0u7e,t3_emv8j7,1578692503.0,NTA - The cats need to be spayed or neutered. If they are going to release the cats to the same area then the lady and her husband probably won't even realize what's happened. There are too many cats to keep track of all of the time. Plus I don't see how they would know that you were the one who initiated this.
AmItheAsshole,fdry2rl,t3_emqk29,1578691373.0,NTA - I feel like it's so disrespectful of your mom to do that. Of all the days in the year why on your birthday? My mom got married the day after my birthday and then again on New Year Day and it's irritating. The day after my birthday was done in secret and the other one was attended by the family. I don't celebrate either of those days though because it's not me that got married and I feel like anniversaries are for the married couple to enjoy. Go to the wedding if you feel like you want to and won't be angry about it. If you don't really care either way then just don't go and everyone else can get over it.
socialskills,fdrwwep,t3_emrm8p,1578690901.0,It's not that you can't talk to a girl about all subjects. You can't talk about all subjects to anyone. You need to know your audience and talk about subjects that are common to all parties involved in the conversation.
nostalgia,fdrnq4h,t3_emr4et,1578687125.0,I remember that cover. Looks like a bunch of other people do too...lol
childfree,fdreth0,t3_emorjx,1578683583.0,I feel like there's something else going on with these kids for them to act the way they were acting. Possibly they were just jealous of the time mom spent with you because the relationship was supposed to be secret? Kids don't like being left out and mom lying to them just makes things way worse. It's like she hasn't taught boundaries at all and the kids are upset that they can't be part of everything going on. Mom is acting like a child too so that doesn't help. Grown people shouldn't have to sneak around or ask their kids for permission.

Music,fdfkeda,t3_el3hcu,1578363753.0,She's my favorite musician. I've loved her since I was a child. She's elegant and funky and soft and boisterous and everything in between. Her talent is amazing!
