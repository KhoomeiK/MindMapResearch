Patriots,fgkdzr7,t1_fgkdgc9,1580863351.0,"My take is he could fall back to the pack pretty quickly.  The first 3 quarters of the superbowl he looked pretty...bad.  Honestly.  Just a lot of weird throws.  But then he lobs up a pass to the fastest guy in the NFL on 3rd and 15.  Gets a pass interference call a few plays later and they have the lead.

I want to see Mahomes without Kelce and Hill for a season. He will still be really good but he might also get exposed.  He isn't really the most accurate QB but he makes up for it by extending plays.  He also has receivers that are really fast.  Stick him with the Pats targets last year and he would struggle too.  So again my point is that he is the best qb in the league today but that could dramatically change in the next 2-5 years."

Kaepernick pretty much beat the packers by himself, twice, in the playoffs.  That gave him enough of a boost that even though he was washed by 2016, 2017, 2018, and even up to this last year people wanted him to have a shot to start again.

Mahomes hasn't dont shit without a monster offense around him.  Heck even career back up matt moore looked just fine in his place.   Let's give mahomes a few years yet before we put him in the hall.  He is really good but he has the perfect storm around him right now making him look great"

Imagine Rodgers switching teams in 2 years?  Or some sophomore in college right now coming into the league and dominating.  Something like this will happen.  Mahomes will go from the hero to the villian pretty quickly.  Brady was once the golden boy too"
Patriots,fggntr6,t1_fgglccb,1580765730.0,"I mean that is about as good as it gets in the NFL.  The Patriots are the exception here.   Wilson and Rodgers have 2 and 4 NFC title appearances and 9 and 10 total playoff wins.  Mahomes already has 4 playoff wins, two AFC title games, and a ring.

I look at something like this, compare to the numbers you posted above, and can clearly see we are missing something.  The top earners (not movie stars, not athletes, not doctors, their bosses boss)  are not paying their fair share.  Almost all new wealth is going to the top earners.  We are getting nothing down here at the bottom.  Either they give it to us through raises or we take it.  If you work full time, you should not be on food stamps.  And if you are, well then we need to tax the company so it will be the one paying for the food stamps.  This isn't hard.  Stop defending the rich."
