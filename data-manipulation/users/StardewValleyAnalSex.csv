One technique I used for long calls was the callback. At around 20/30 minutes, if I knew I'd need another 30 - 60 and it wasn't urgent, tell the user you'll call them back and arrange a time with them.

It cuts your longest calls in half.

Working out a high ticket to call ratio with low call times is a skill in itself. Not a very transferrable skill, though, once you're out of the helpdesk."

The thing is though, since you're aware that you're dreaming, you're also aware that you're sleeping, so it took me conscious effort to avoid thinking about these facts. In the end, as cool as it was, I just genuinely love sleep so much that I decided it wasn't worth the effort.

I learned Git, basic Ansible, basic Kubernetes concepts, and some TeamCity stuff. On top of that, I learned a lot about how AWS functions in an enterprise. The experience wasn't totally wasted, but after the first few months & first couple of projects I just seem to have stopped being involved in a lot of things.

I then got demotivated and lost the desire to keep pushing. This occurred gradually.

It was also a large org, so any improvements I DID suggest never went anywhere. I delivered one or two projects that involved some coding and systems work and I loved every minute of them.

ITCareerQuestions,ff8wf4h,t1_ff8m6f2,1579698322.0,"The bulk of my experience comes from vendor support - so X campany buys Y product, their SOC/NOC/etc has an issue or question about the product, calls support who escalates to me. I'll troubleshoot, try to reproduce the issue in my lab, etc. I then escalate to engineering/dev if I'm unable to resolve it or if I think there might be an issue with the code.

As such, I think I lack a lot of the ""operational"" sensibilities. 

I've never done MSP work though, no.

Honestly, this whole experience has made me question whether I could ever succeed in an ops/devops role at all. Maybe an MSP type gig could bridge the skills gap, as you said."

I'm not one to shift blame, and I think one of my biggest takeaways from this is that I need to be more assertive in regards to my needs in the workplace. That said, I think the reason I am actually a bit angry is because, like you said, it was also kind of bad management.

The boss in this role was actually a former dev, so he was super techy, however he wasn't very good at actually managing people. If I had received any critical feedback at all I would have at least had an idea of where I was failing, but it was all sunshine and puppies whenever we spoke."
ITCareerQuestions,ff6ph41,t1_ff6mscj,1579632152.0,"Honestly, go for it.

ITCareerQuestions,ff6oqvb,t1_ff6nlgz,1579631716.0,"I think this is a good point and you're right. But at the same time, I joined with the mutual understanding that I was from a support background and would take a little while longer than normal to get up to speed.

That said, the role has issues/tickets (I.E, ""Find a way to automate X"", Cost analysis of Y"", etc. None of these were fed through to me, So I feel like I had no frame to build that skillset on. If I had been given the same amount of work as the rest of the team (or any work at all), I would have had an easier time transitioning into more of an engineering type mindset.

I definitely feel that a lot of this is my own fault, I'm just not sure exactly where I could have done better. I tried to take the initiative on multiple occasions with varying results. During my 1 on 1's with the manager he was always super positive and seemed excited about my future and what little I had done - kept talking about projects I could help with in the future.

Pro services generally pays more than vendor support. Some companies pay you a percentage of the cost that the customer paid to get your assistance in addition to a nice base wage.

Sales engineers make bank. Easily double what you'd make in vendor support. But this is a highly stressful and competitive job - you're half sales, half technical architect.

Oracle are a massive company - they employ over 100,000 people, and their product portfolio is mind blowingly large - so there is no way of being able to tell for sure what you're in for.

I worked there for a little while though so if you have any questions I'm happy to answer them, if I can.

My actual opinion of Oracle is pretty negative, but I will say that it looks really good on your CV."

Also try the word ""Associate"" as well as ""Junior"" in front of these. I get a lot of hits for mid level jobs with similar titles minus the junior/associate. I'm based in the UK near London, though, so it's a total tech hub here. 

Also, look at mid to senior level jobs postings to find the tech you should study - they tend to be more specific in telling you what you need to succeed in them. Junior postings can be kinda vague.

My point was that we kind of take the innovations and artistic directions for granted, now that we see it everywhere. It's easy to forget that when it came out, it was absolutely unique. It changed the genre, and while it has some issues, it is a gaming masterpiece.

The reason you would pick Dark Souls or other Zelda games to play over OOT is precisely because they modernised the template laid out by OOT - my personal favourite is MM, and Wind Waker is possibly the most fun I've ever had playing a game, but neither are any good without the solid foundation borrowed from OOT."

Vendor support can pay a decent wage if you're supporting complex products like IPS or SIEM at a tier 2 - 3 level.

Pro services generally pays more than vendor support. Some companies pay you a percentage of the cost that the customer paid to get your assistance in addition to a nice base wage.

Sales engineers make bank. Easily double what you'd make in vendor support. But this is a highly stressful and competitive job - you're half sales, half technical architect. Lots of pressure to perform. You normally work with a salesperson - you'll be his right hand man. You earn a comission on the sales made, but since it's also highly technical, you generally have an above average base salary."
