Spellblade, Hunter, Monk sounds fun. I was actually thinking of doing this because I was really enjoying my current build of Hunter, Monk, Merc (for that stamina and movement bonus which makes exploring in this game so much more enjoyable). I see how enjoyable Spellblade would be in place of Merc. Buffing a melee weapon and sending out an elemental discharge every now and then sounds fun. I love elemental discharge.

vegancirclejerk,ffg9iff,t1_ffg7mw4,1579901364.0,"To me, the question ""are you against animal abuse?"", as with any other word in the place of animal abuse, is asking, ""are you against what is described in your interpretation of this particular word?""

Words are subjective, and although we have dictionaries the definitions in the dictionaries serve more as guidelines. The meaning of words, atleast when used in conversation, depends on the individual's interpretation of that word. 

What I would do is ask, ""Are you against animal abuse"" and if they respond with ""Yes"" I might ask what their definition of animal abuse is. I might not always ask what their definition is but if a person tacks on to their response something like, ""thats why im against veganism"" i'm definitely going to ask what their definition is because I don't think we have the same definition.

In my case I don't really have a clear definition of animal abuse, yet, because I never took the time to write my interpretation out. It will probably come out as something like, ""animal abuse is the use and or comodification of an animal for personal desires""."

vegancirclejerk,ffg57jp,t1_ffg1pbn,1579898713.0,"Well, I have an understanding of the word animal abuse, so do you, and so does he. I'd say yours and mine are probably similar but his isn't similar to ours. His definition of animal abuse will probably be inconsistent and stupid but it's still his understanding, a dumbass understanding but w/e. So if you ask something like ""Are you against animal abuse"" in his mind he checks his understanding of the word animal abuse and checks to see if hes against what is described in his interpretation of the word. 

&#x200B;

For all we know, his definition of animal abuse could be the action of not smiling at an animal and saying ""thank you for your sacrifice"" before slashing their throat open. 

&#x200B;

If he truly believed that is what animal abuse is and he actually was against the action described in his interpretation of the word and you told him he was not actually against animal abuse (hes gonna accept animal abuse to be his understanding of the word) then there would be a problem. 

&#x200B;

The problem would be telling him he's not against something that he's against. Basically, you're strawmanning him. 

&#x200B;

So when you ask ""are you against animal abuse"" and they respond with ""ye I'm against animal abuse"" and they follow up with some big-dummy comment saying ""thats why im against vegans"" just ask what their definition of animal abuse is because it's almost certainly not the one vegans are using."

&#x200B;

Edit:

On your end, linking carnism to religion was kind of dumb. Carnism is just a mindset that leads to particularly fucked up actions and people have attributed a word to it. It's not really a religion. If thats a religion then it seems any particular type of mindset could also be classified as a religion and thats not the case. His curiosity as to why you are bringing up the word carnist does make sense. Should have just replaced the word carnist with what the word meant.

&#x200B;

An example of the word being replaced with the definition:

""Carnists only exist in vegan logic""

If he knew the definition then it would read:

""People who support the use and production of animals only exist in vegan logic""

That would be factually incorrect and makes no sense so he would not be able to deny that.

&#x200B;

He's probably wondering why you are using a word over and over that he doesnt care about and hasnt heard enough to automatically know what it means. You keep using it and he keeps not knowing what it means and it's like you are talking right past him. In situations like that I just insert the definition of the word in place of the word itself.

""We won’t eliminate the seals- no chance of that- but it is about re-balancing the ecosystem, and wild salmon are under threat ""

It's so blatant to see they mean re-balance for humans to benefit from.

&#x200B;

You have dumb people growing up and when they see the phrase ""re-balance the ecosystem"" used like this they don't have a clear idea as to what it means because it's a lie. So then they fail to distinguish the difference between re-balancing the ecosystem for human desires and re-balancing the ecosystem because its vital for all life to survive and then they equivocate with that phrase and use it as a justification for their participation in some fucked up actions.

&#x200B;

Like they might see ""we're gonna re-balance the ecosystem"" and then try to find a reason as to why the ecosystem is being re-balanced, because these murderers arent gonna admit it's for their own selfish desires, and so they just might make an assumption that the ecosystem being re-balanced is crucial for the ecosystem to survive. It's the same type of phenomenon that you see as a result from companies posting the protein content on their boxes. People saw the protein content listed on boxes through out their life, looked for a reason (consciously or subconsciously) as to why it's on the box, and just assumed the reason it's posted on the box is because it's very important. This is the reason we have to put up with the ""protein tho"" argument. Same with gluten-free. God I hate humans so much.

There is a lot of running. But this isn't necessarily a downside to the game because you will encounter enemies and might stumble upon loot on the way or a location that isnt even mentioned on the map. I think these long journies provide a meaningful experience. Just imagine hypothetically you could instantly teleport to all your destinations. The game would be boring. So if you aren't instantly teleporting then you are taking some amount of time to journey to a location. How much time do you want that journey to be? 1 second? 1 minute? 2 minutes? 5 minutes? A game would be boring if it is focused on survival and exploration and you could quickly traverse the lands. The long spans are necessary to fulfill the survival element. It provides tension. It makes you think about inventory management. It makes you think whether you should or should not explore some area.  Should you keep the loot you have or drop it because it might make your journey slower. Maybe keeping loot gets you killed because you ran and depleted your stamina and now an enemy is faster than you and will kill you.

This game pissed me off for a solid 6 hours at the beginning because of the bs combat. But I stuck with it because I hate quitting when there is a desirable reward, for me it was runic magic, and I'm happy because now that I know locations and how to manipulate the shit combat system it makes the game really enjoyable. Exploration is enjoyable. I hate exploring in most games because it feels so scripted. I would prefer in new installments of the game there are more unmarked locations on the map to make exploration even more exciting. This game is different. I think its mostly due to the map not pinpointing exactly where you are which means you have to invest effort into actually knowing the world around you.

It can also be set before a fight so you can lure noobs into it and as you are luring them you can set up a Shim so right when they get blasted you immediately set another trap. It's glorious. I think other magic needs to be buffed to be on par. I do not think Runic Trap needs a nerf. All the other spells just need to be worth using. Philosopher tree is bad. .34 mana reg p/sec is cool but that doesnt really matter too much late game when you have mana reduction clothing and access to astral potions + you can always use a tent to regenerate mana and Reveal Soul + Spark.

That's all I need to hear in order to stop. If you're not even gonna participate then what's the point. It does relate to the topic and if you participated I would show you how but you're only interested in responding and not participating. Just because every question I pose doesnt have the word sheep in it doesn't mean it's not about the topic. If you don't think it's wrong to enslave black people or farm 1 year old guatemalan children then obviously you aren't gonna give a shit about sheep. It's important to find out what you value.

facepalm,fdor9zw,t1_fdmt94m,1578611119.0,"> That's again moving away from the topic of what to do with individual sheep in a world that includes lots of sheep.

Why don't you just answer the hypothetical? I notice you often respond to my questions instead of answering. What you  gave me was not an answer. I want answers not responses. Do you also believe there is a distinction between what an answer is and what a response is? An answer to me, in respect to the question, provides some type of conclusion or truth. A response can be anything:

Question: What is 2+2?
Response: Fire is hot
Answer: 4


Now, I'm guessing you will retort with something along the lines of ""Well you just dont like my answer and so you call it a response."" If that's the case I'm probably just gonna dip soon. I don't want to waste my time asking questions and getting responses instead of answers. I don't see how that benefits either of us.

If I ask a hypothetical such as the one below I am hoping for an answer to the hypothetical: 

>Let's say all the sheep that currently existed right now disappear except for 2. How does this influence your position on whether or not it is morally acceptable to breed sheep into existence to be used as a product?

I'll just respectfully keep asking them over until I get an actual answer to the question but I just wanted to point this out to you. 

>What, wolves are allowed to use sheep but we aren't? Why?

How can I control what a wolf does? Again, what you said was not a logical entailment of my position. I'm against using and commodifying animals. I can only control what I do. I guess you also think a logical entailment of my position is for me to be ok with or for me to want to murder the entire human species because they also use animals. You're being silly. 

And yes, I would like to stop predators from using other animals. It's still not a logical entailment of my position though. I don't think that not killing predators results in me having a propositional-logic contradiction with my position on the matter. 

>That obviously means ""no"". Which is what you asked for, a yes or no answer, so I pointed out that I had given it to you before. 

You need to understand that I am not inside of your brain. I'm me and you are you. 'I wouldnt approve' as a synonym for 'no' might make perfect sense to you because that's how you have interpreted it to mean. I have not interpreted it to mean that. I have seen people use it that way, however. The literal meaning is not a synonym for the word no. I'm just trying to be as clear as possible so there is no confusion. 

>I mean, yeah, we could do this one thing. But there's a whole lot of other things worth doing as well, and we can't do them all. What you're asking is abandoning all the other worthwhile stuff in favor of your own pet idea. Also, by ""subsidizing"", I assume you mean with tax money? Taken from other people by (a threat of) force? Careful, you true colors are showing.

Ye, we could. Lol. It sounded like you were saying it was impossible to do but it turns out it is possible. I was attacking the idea that it was impossible to do.Glad we settled that. It turns out you can do multiple things in life at the same time. It's not like everyone in the world would have to farm food for the animals (that just doesnt even make sense) or be in the presence of the animals to take care of them. You can have like 3 people watch over scores of animals. Sort of like daycare. It's not a pet idea. It's a justice idea. We could watch over them and let them live fulfilling lives until the day they die. By subsidizing I do mean with the tax money. Threat of force? It's necessary for the operation of society. Individuals, like you and me, benefit greatly from society so we owe something to society. If people don't like taxes then they can go neck themselves. 


>No, you said some slave owners justified it

No I didn't. See, this is why I like text. Here's what I said:

>Do you think a slave master ever used that kind of justification before that you just used?

Tell me where I said slave owners justified it. How is a question a claim? Lol.... don't weasel out of this one. Seems like you're focused on trying to figure out why I say the things I say and you confused your answer to your question of why I asked the question with the idea that I made a claim. I didn't make a claim. You told me I did and I didn't. 

>I said nothing about my own position on the matter.

Ye. I know. I asked ""Is it ok to enslave them?"" to find out your position on the matter and you dodged it completely. Maybe you missed it.

>And yeah, I'd totally freeze up, because I'd be giving things some thought

That's fine. I'm a patient person. The people in the discord server I participate in give people all the time in the world to respond. We understand questions might take some time to answer, especially if the other person hasn't thought about it, and we won't harp on them for taking time. They just have to do it on voice chat. It separates the men from the children.

>You seem to think that we should end suffering by removing the things that suffer

Not bringing sheep into existence is not removing them. How do you remove something that doesnt exist? If you are responding to my euthanasia comment then I've already told you my position on the matter. I want people to provide them with resources so they can live out their lives. You're just telling me, ""Oh noo thats not possible"" but we've already concluded that it is. Now we just have to get people, like you, on board. And to do this we need to see why people value some living beings but not others. Do you have any dogs? Do you think what we do to farmed animals is equally acceptable to do to dogs or cats or any other cute and cuddly creature? 

>The slavers' argument holds water in the case of animals, because their lives are improved by domestication and they have no concept of liberty and bondage, so the downside isn't there.

Neither does a 1 year old Guatemalan child

You still havent given me an answer to my Guatemalan or my slave hypotheticals which are crucial to this conversation because they will take us down paths that explore your value system and then I'll be able to see if your values and actions are consistent. Who knows, maybe you have some cognitive dissonance going on. Employing logic might help us discover if this is the case. But please commit to a position. If you won't commit to a position then why are we even talking? 

You've said:

>I wouldn't approve, but I can't stop you, so I guess you could.

As I have said before, ""I wouldnt approve"" means nothing to me. You have said it means no but I want a complete sentence so that way we can be as clear as possible. What I want to find out is whether or not me performing the action of running a Guatemalan child meat farm would be morally acceptable under your moral system. You said you are a consequentialist. Under your consequentalist moral system is it acceptable for me to perform this action? 

Also, under your consequentialist moral system, is it morally acceptable for me to enslave black people so that way I can have them pick cotton so that I can sell the cotton for money? I'll also give them the highest welfare lives and when they are old and can't do anymore work I intend on humanely slashing their throat and consuming or selling their corpse afterwards. Is this morally acceptable under your moral system?"
facepalm,fdmfdjh,t1_fdm09iu,1578548060.0,">Again, you could just as easily point to a few videos of cops beating (or hell, shooting) innocent people and conclude from that that we should abolish the police. That's literally your logic here. That ""so?"" is entirely appropriate, and I remain unconvinced by your logic.

Why do so many videos exist of farm workers beating the farmed animals? Is it something about the job? Does it attract sickos? Does the job itself make people this way? Why cant the people just spend hours waiting for the sheep to relax so that way they can be shorn?

>I see no difference between being slaughered by a human or eaten by a wolf

Does this work in a human context as well? Do you see any difference between a human getting slaughtered by a human compared to getting eaten by a wolf? ""So from the point of view of the animal there is no difference."" Same with a 1 year old Guatemalan. They dont see a difference.

>Well because depriving someone of their liberty is pretty poor treatment... buuuuut you get to live in civilization in return.

It seems with this I get to justify anything done to anyone so long as they get to live in civilization. Do I get to justify everything?

>I guess, but that's not addressing the point of what to do with an individual sheep that is not profitable anymore

Why is this a point you are focused on? Let's say all the sheep that currently existed right now disappear except for 2. How does this influence your position on whether or not it is morally acceptable to breed sheep into existence to be used as a product?

We can provide for as many sheep and other farmed animals as possible and euthanize the others if it came down to it and then from there we never breed any animal into existence again. You are fine with them having their throats slashed. I can't imagine you'd have a problem with them being euthanized.

>and whether the package overall is good or bad depends on how good or bad the invidual items are, which is a matter of opinion.

Individual items..? Whether the package overall is good or bad..? What are you talking about? How does this point even relate to your position? I'm so confused. Can you write this point out in a complete sentence or a different way and also include how it relates to your position?

>shouldn't you also want to prevent predators from hunting?

That's not even a logical entailment of my position. Im against the use and commodification of animals. How does a wolf hunting a sheep mean that I'm commodifying or using an animal?

>Point is, your viewpoint is self-contradictory.

Don't assume my position (idk if thats why you meant by viewpoint or if by viewpoint you meant a singular point I have about something)

>We could not, because someone would have to pay for that food and water and shelter, of which there is a limited supply.

If people cared about non-humans to the point where they didn't treat them like objects then we would be the ones paying for those supplies. Or rather a mixture of some people paying for the care and some actually providing the care. We already do all that shit to begin with. At that point people would be donating time. We can also subsidize it.

>It's that pesky entropy again

Ye, and us humans are efficient at working around it. We can help the non-humans with that pesky problem

>I wouldn't approve

What does that even mean? Are you saying it would be an immoral act? Are you saying you wouldnt like the sound of it but aren't gonna do a thing about it? You think you are being clear with some of your responses but you aren't and it's a shame that you can't even see how unclear you are being. If you think something is immoral use the word immoral. ""I wouldn't approve"" is vague and I have no clue what exactly you mean by it.

Is it, under your moral system, acceptable for me to farm Guatemalan children and humanely stab them in the throat at the ripe age of 1 and then eat their corpses or sell them? Since they wouldnt be able to express their desires I just have to assume they would rather live that 1 year than not at all so I think the package deal I'm providing them is fair. They will get to live amazing high welfare lives up until the point where their time is up. It really is a good deal. Also, if they don't like it, they can go neck themselves. I didn't get to choose to be here and neither did they but since I am able to kill myself if I don't like being here then it obviously makes sense that so can they. It's definitely not a bad position to be forced into. If it is immoral under your moral system then why is that the case?

In regards to a comment you responded to earlier you didn't even explicitly say no when I asked if it was ok to enslave black people. It sounded like you justified it instead. Remember:

>I bet some black people were treated better than the ones in Africa. Is it ok to enslave them?

So can I enslave them? I need to make money too. Ye, I might be depriving them of liberty but they get a package deal though.

>but I prefer having all the time I need to organize and articulate my thoughts and have everything nicely on record.

I have a feeling you are biting bullets to stay consistent with your position. I want to ask you questions in real time to see if you freeze up and to be able to hear your tone and how exactly you respond. I can record the conversation so we'll always have a record. It's debate practice for us both. If your concern is Gish Galloping there will be plenty of people and moderators in the debate channel monitoring the debate. This way we could just focus on 1 proposition at a time. 

Typically when I talk to people who support animal commodification they commit to the position that it is all ok because humans and non-humans are so different than each other. But you seem to be talking in a way that suggests what we do to these animals is not as bad as it is and what we do to them is in fact fair. If it were the case that you don't think being a different species is the reason that it is morally acceptable to do what we do to animals like sheep then I'm trying to figure out what you think the reason is because it sounds like the reason you think what we do to them is morally acceptable is because you think it is fair. I disagree with that notion. So do you hold that position or some other position?

Edit: The above paragraph"

So? Lol, the video shows them getting beaten and hurt while simply being shorn. So...lmao...

>Yes, of course. Every living thing is destined to die,

I didn't say destined to die. I said destined to be slaughtered. A slaughterer slaughters someone. In the case of farm animals and sheep the human is the slaughterer. You said die as if it's the same thing. There is a difference. Nobody chooses to be slaughtered. The sheep don't want to be slaughtered; no one does. They are being killed against their will. 

>I wouldn't approve, but I can't stop you, so I guess you could.

I can do anything I want; of course you can't stop me. Why wouldn't you approve? I didn't ask to be on this planet and if the Guatemalan children don't like this glorious gift I bestow upon them then they can just neck themselves. It's all good. Also, I'll treat them humanely. Especially when I cut open their throat. 


>Of course they did say that. Was it true? Depends on how much you value freedom, I guess. 

Uhh...what are you saying?? Why would the truthfulness of a claim depend on how much they value freedom? If the claim is they were treated better than africans then it's either true that they were treated better than africans or they were not treated better than africans. What does valuing freedom have to do with this?

>Nobody's going to kill you, of course, but throwing a sheep out into the wilderness is a death sentence anyway

What we could do is stop putting them in scenarios where they can breed. We could separate the males from females, or neuter and spay them and then there wont be any sheep thrown in the wilderness because the domestic species will stop existing.  We could also not throw a sheep into the wilderness and instead provide them with food and water until they die naturally, not by a knife.

>You can't tell me they can't comprehend death and suicide and then immediately follow up by saying we're depriving them of liberty as if they can understand that.

Ye I can. Why would understanding the concept of death and suicide be a requisite for justice?
Do 1 year olds understand death and suicide? No, no they don't. So go ahead and bite the bullet on this one too: it's morally acceptable for me to farm Guatemalan 1 year olds according to your moral system, right?

At 1 year old I will humanely stab Guatemalan children in the throat and eat their corpse. I need to make money, if they don't like it they can kill themselves, and they don't understand the concept of death and suicide so it's all good. 


Your morality system leads to some interesting reductios.

Oh really now? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siTvjWE2aVw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siTvjWE2aVw 

Also, they may not be killed while they are being shorn because that comes later when they are useless. Why would they murder the money making machine when it makes them money? That doesnt make any sense. It makes far more sense to murder them for money after they dont make any more money from wool. Do you think that meat is going to ""waste""? It's gonna be sold off. Someones gonna eat it. A human or a pet. Is it it not the case that they are destined to be slaughtered once they come into existence? Yes or no please. Make sure to watch the parts of the videos where the sheep are humanely stabbed in the throat. 


>And sure, that sheep didn't ask to be brought into existence, but then neither did I or any other living thing in the history of life. If its existence really was unbearable suffering, it could choose to cease to be, same as you or me.

So could I use this same exact justification to start a humane free-range Guatemalan child meat farm?

""Go kill yourself then""

Edit: Also, this isnt even true. Non-human animals are comparable to children in intelligence. How many human children (like 3-8 years old) per year neck themselves? They don't understand the concept of life and death too well. And if they do, if they have the capacity to understand those types of concepts, then don't you think it would be fucked up to use them?

>Net positive for whom?

Any and all forms of the life that arent human

>Eventually yeah, I guess, though I don't really know if sheep ever go bald with age and stop producing wool.

Edit2: They might not stop producing wool but thats not what is important though is it? What is important is whether or not the cash produced from selling the wool is greater than the cash expended keeping them alive, right? And surely the profit also has to reach a certain point or else it isnt worth it (they could farm something else or someone else). And perhaps it's the case that as they get older they produce less and less wool. Maybe a few coats worth but less and less nonetheless. 

> I still think their lives are overall much better and longer than those of their cousins living in the wild.

I bet some black people were treated better than the ones in Africa. Is it ok to enslave them? Do you think a slave master ever used that kind of justification before that you just used? ""Well they are treated better than these ones""

It's not a refutation. Plastic can kill animals; as in it's a possibility that an animal dies from ingesting plastic. It doesn't mean they will. Theres also a very clear distinction between paying someone to force an an animal into existence, an existence which they will inevitably be forced out of because they dont produce enough profit, and paying someone for a plastic product and then one day disposing of that plastic product and it somehow ending up in a animal's stomach which then ends up killing them (relatively low chance) . There does not need to be any animals brought into existence to be used so that way a plastic product can be created. There NEEDS to be a sheep in order for wool to be created. I'm not using any animals IF I purchase a plastic product, which I do avoid as much as possible because I don't want to take risks of harming non-humans with plastic, but you do pay for animals to be used if you pay for wool. I'm a deontologist. Idgaf about net positives/gains and net negatives/losses. It would be a net positive if all humans burned in hellfire and died. That doesn't make it moral for someone to pay for that to happen. 

>I mean, yes. How do you think sheep multiply? Mitosis?

Some farmer jacks off a male or uses a machine to do that and then collects the semen and then forces that semen inside a female. You really think farmers are waiting around for a male and female to fuck...? Time is money.

>Depends on where that plastic ends up. If they ingest large bits of it, yeah, they can easily die from that. And we still don't know what health effects exactly microplastics have (hint: probably not very good).

So even you admit a plastic product being created will not guarantee an animal dies. It all depends on certain factors. And just a little bonus to think about, it's totally possible to never throw away a plastic product, right? 

What do you think happens to a sheep when the sheep doesnt produce a profit? Do you think the farmer a) wastes money keeping the sheep alive or b) kills them for a little bit more profit?

If demand stays the same but supply increases well it sure as shit seems the price of the commodity produced will be of less value compared to what it was before these massive swathes of land started producing that commodity. The question then is how much will the price decrease? Will the price decrease so much that it isnt worth making that particular crop anymore? Maybe, right? It's possible. So if that were to be the case then they would likely choose a different crop, that is if they are intent on farming. But the crop they grow all depends on what the people want, right? They arent just gonna grow fields of vanilla or alfalfa if not enough people want vanilla or alfalfa, right? So what they grow?  Can they sell the land? Can they turn the land into a resort or some other facility? They could do that, right? Maybe. It would all depend on who values that land. What could the land provide?

Back to the hypotheticals. So let's say you had information and you knew a particular Carolina Wolf Spider was going to get trapped in an abandoned web and all you had to do to prevent that situation from happening was to remove the web. Would you remove the web? Lets say this web was located right outside your house door. This way you would have to exert very little effort to remove the web.

Do you guys think that the fact that a human is a human would somehow effect the flavor of their perfectly seared ass cheeks? We're meat sacks.

Anyway, whether or not pets are vegan all depends on your definition of vegan. I think humans should only house an animal if their life depends on it. People get a lot of enjoyment from non-human animals and this may entice some to adopt or purchase animals. If you adopt an animal because you wanted to benefit from it in anyway then it seems you are using the animal, even if the animal is getting a benefit from the relationship. I believe this mentality is the same mentality that carnists have that make them think it is ok to use animals for their own benefit, albeit, a much less severe version of the mentality. In order to end animal commodification we need to not use them. They aren't ours."
