You are a great mom making sure people have money so you can all do things together. Your husband sound cool to.  Enjoy your job and hang with people you like. If it's just a job then find one that you look forward to going to each day 
I love my work, always have. :)"

BreakUps,fgft67b,t3_ey6vc9,1580747052.0,"You're not a bad person.

Fuck him for walking out. Nothing wrong with being angry as someone who leave you when you were planning to be with them.

You can reach out if you want and want him back but if you are angry he left and messed up your life's dreams then it's okay to be angry at him and not want to see or talk to him again. 

You didn't ask to be here, you got no choice. But you do get to chose how to treat him and how to think about him from now on."
BreakUps,fgfsi7h,t3_exvpkh,1580746625.0,"2 years for me and I think about my ex wife every week.
It used to be every day and every hour before that :)

I too hated people telling me time would solve the problem. But it did. My first breakup was a divorce. I didn't even have nightmares that were as bad.  

But I made it."
Divorce,ffakg43,t1_fdklplh,1579737962.0,"I blocked her on all platforms and most of my friends understood they needed to black her as well.  I blocked all mutual friends and started a new life.  I was surprised by the fiends who stayed with me and wasn't upset at those who didn't. 
Some call me selfish and that is okay. I didn't ask to be in this position and no one cared my wife put me here. No one cared she wasn't doing ""everything for the kids"".  So I laugh when people use that phrase.
My life is amazing now, just not the life I expected to have after being with someone for 23 years.
I am lucky I don't need to see my ex wife for the most part. My daughter is old enough to go out to the car when mom arrives to pickup and drop off. There is no reason for us to talk anymore unless we can't make the normal drop off due to vacation running late or starting early.
Parallel parenting seems to work great for us."
bigdickproblems,ffa56yr,t1_ff9jyzz,1579728107.0,I let it go up and an angel so it poked up through my pocket a bit. My shirt can cover that pretty easily and it stays in place and easy to talk and be casual with my hand partly in my pocket.
BreakUps,ffa4je8,t3_esga1p,1579727738.0,"I did that for a long time and started to feel a lot better when all hope was gone and I blocked in every way possible. I know it's hard and am not trying to talk you into doing that until you are ready.
My new life is awesome I just never thought this would be the life I'd have. :)"

BreakUps,ff0ecqz,t3_er0pmk,1579468080.0,"Happened to me after being married 19 years. I know the feeling of insanity. I thought about jumping into the grand canyon while on vacation there.  This was the first time I had ever been truly sad.

I had a friend. He was the most unreliable person. You would be crazy to count on him. But i called him anyway.  And I'm glad I did. He said he has my back and would come anytime I needed. I'd text him at 2am, 11am, 10pm...didn't matter he always wanted to meet up! We are good friends now :)

I held out hope for a year or more. I was honest with my new girlfriend about how much I loved my wife (and then ex wife) and she accepted me for it. I didn't have to lie or pretend everything was fine if it wasn't.

Slowly over time. It got better.  People ask me if I am happier now. But you see, I was never unhappy. So I tell them I am just happy. Like before but in an alternative life I didn't expect. My girlfriend is happy too. 

So it will get better. Just reach out, posting here is great. You can call me if you want but it's best if you have someone who can easily meet you in person when you need them too."

BreakUps,fdycz02,t3_encr9q,1578778409.0,"I feel like I can't comment on this thread without saying my first breakup was a divorce. 
So I have over 20 years of memories like that. For me two things made it easier.

A. I bought a new house. This made a bigger difference than I expected and everything improved a lot fast because everything was new.
B. I found someone who was sexually compatible and we both agreed sex was extremely important if we were going to be together. I was also able to easily share memories about my ex with this person and she loved me for it.

I know one can not just buy a new home after every breakup (assuming it happens more often to real people) but change rooms at least or move to New apartment when lease is up?"

Divorce,fdy6x4d,t1_fdxnw5g,1578776724.0,"Great question. I wish I had asked my daughter that 1.5 years ago.

I understand about the ""still a family thing"". I put up with this for a few months but only to give my ex a chance to change her mind. I had no interest in turning a 20 year marriage into a relationship where two old buddies get together for wings once a week. :)
My daughter was a older so I basically just explained it like that and I havn't seen my ex since.
I should add that my fiancee's ex husband has come and stayed at our place and the only buddy thing seems like it works okay for them (they don't have kids together) so maybe it does work sometimes. So if it's a goal for divorcing parents then I wouldn't discourage it."
Divorce,fdy4dmx,t1_fdxr6uw,1578776008.0,"This is perfect.
One thing I will add. It is important to fully decorate your new place. Hire a professional if needed.
 When I first moved out I was really worried about money so I only bought what I needed to be comfortable.  
Everyone who visited commented why it looked like a bachelor pad. This was confusing because I had not been a bachelor in 20 years and I wanted to make sure I didn't waste money I might need.
It's the little details that make the house feel like home. I had a girlfriend who took the lead on decorating and it made a huge difference."
