Volkswagen,fgjtgrw,t1_fgim0n2,1580851068.0,"I live in a country with a bi-annual inspection and there is quite a decent amount of things to deal with.

Windows and window washers: Front windshield must not have any cracks in it. Your wipers must work(if your car has rear windshield wiper that must also work) windshield washer must work(if pressent headlight and rear windshield washers must work).

Rust:cars body shouldn't have any rust holes or rusted to the point you can rip any part of rust with your bare hands.

Lights:All car lights that are present must work and they have to be properly wired(you can't have your rear fog lights be your brake lights or reverse lights be your brake lights and etc). Front headlights if they're reflectors can't have xenon or LED bulbs in them. Front headlights and front fog lights(if they're present) must  have a properly adjusted and not shine too high or too low.

Brakes: Front and rear brakes must have sufficient braking power and the wheels need to have similar braking power between them(example:front left and front right wheel can't have more than around 15% difference in braking). Your hand brake also needs to meet these kind of requirement but they're not as strict. Brake lines must not be heavily corroded or leaking fluids.

Drivetrain: Engine can't make any unordinary squeaks or rattles. No fluid leaks of any sort. 

Suspension:no excessive play in any suspension components. No torn rubber or leaks out of suspension bushings or joints.

Tires: No summer tires in the winter. Tires must have sufficient tread depth(during winter no less than 3mm, summer 1.6mm).

Emissions: Varies between gasoline, gasoline+LPG and diesel. Gasoline emissions are tested at idle. Gasoline + LPG is tested usually around half RPM of redline (not really sure because I don't own LPG equipped vehicle) and diesel gets tested at redline. Cars must have all of its pollutant reduction equipment present(Cats, DPFs, GPFs and etc) and they must not have any signs of tempering(no obvious weld spots unless you have documentation proving these are made to fix the device).

Other:you must have light reflecting vest, first aid kit and a valid fire extinguisher in your car.
