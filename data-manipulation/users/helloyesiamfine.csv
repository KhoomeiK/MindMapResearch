SuicideWatch,ff9jt0u,t1_ff9iwdf,1579714514.0,good! I’m with you. I’ll try my best too. Let’s stay alive.
SuicideWatch,ff8wiod,t3_esbbvj,1579698411.0,"The fact that you did it means you’re in horrible pain and you desperately need  help. Please stay clear of blades and sharp objects and take care of your wounds, seek medical help if needed. Please take care of yourself. Please stay alive. Please, please!"
SuicideWatch,ff8w9tf,t3_esbcal,1579698190.0,"Maybe because it is a lack of uncertainty? Our brains seem to be terrified of uncertainty. When I was actively suicidal I was like... not happy, but I had a plan and it was more or less clear. Then with therapy suicidal thoughts went away and it’s weird. It’s a weird feeling. It’s strange because I’ve wanted to kill myself for most of my life. But I don’t want to go back. Please stay alive.

edit:wrong word"
SuicideWatch,ff8vn0y,t3_esbcde,1579697619.0,"Please seek medical help. There are so many times I thought about ending it this way too. Seek medical help. Sertraline overdose is a torturous way to go. You don’t want that, I’m sure you don’t. Please stay alive, please, please stay alive."
SuicideWatch,fegjwmc,t1_fe7k0fc,1579095008.0,still here although delirious from my sleeping meds. so much work ahead
SuicideWatch,feaiy1j,t3_eo3mfi,1578949434.0,So so happy for you! Have a wonderful life friend!
SuicideWatch,fe5q4zd,t1_fe5klmw,1578872984.0,"you guys want some company? let’s stick together for a bit
I don’t smoke but I can just be here you know 
It’s very calm outside. No rain, no snow. Just freezing, slowly. Dark. I’m listening to Florence and the machine, hah"
SuicideWatch,fe587zb,t3_enqks5,1578866499.0,"Please stay. We are strangers but this pain that each of us experiences drives us together. And we should stick together and stay alive, wait out the storm. Every time I see a post on here I just hope against all hope(I can’t pray, it doesn’t change anything for me) that the person on the other side of the screen is alive. You think it doesn’t matter but it does. You being alive matters because it minus one dead body, minus one thought of “maybe I should do that too, if they had enough courage”. Please please stay. please I hope you’re alive."
NinjaSexParty,f8cp7j6,t3_e08xpx,1574465554.0,"Hey Brian! Just a small question: what usually decides whether the songs goes or stays on an album? Are there any songs that made you both go like “fuck YES this is staying and we’re performing the heck out of it”?

p.s. Your version of Don’t Fear The Reaper was cathartic, and I cannot thank you guys enough for it."
