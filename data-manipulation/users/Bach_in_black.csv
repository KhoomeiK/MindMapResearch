movies,fdqn8qg,t1_fdpum75,1578670663.0,I believe the Mines of Moria was a set the actors were on that was then melded with miniatures using CG.
movies,fdpufvs,t1_fdptyxf,1578640932.0,Exactly. Pre-prod was on point for those films. It’s a shame not all large movies have that long for pre-prod. Thankfully PJ got what he needed to make 3 amazing films. I also feel like for a story as big as LotR you absolutely need to be tedious about the set up for how things will work/be shot.
movies,fdpsyib,t1_fdpsogv,1578639258.0,"Absolutely. I just mean, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, BTTF all has their stories expanded after the first one was shot and well received by the public. LotR already had a fully fleshed our story to draw from (probably a big help), used the same team for everything from writing to editing to foley artists, and was done almost entirely congruously save for pick-ups. Incredible feat of filmmaking, no one can question that. It is still a lot easier to steer a production through a trilogy that had this much foresight prior to any shooting and used the same production teams on all aspects of the films."
movies,fdpo13r,t1_fdplnry,1578634230.0,Easy to maintain consistency when all principal photography for all 3 films was done at the same time. Pick ups only happened when each movie was being edited together and PJ realized they needed something else to flesh out a scene. But yeah it’s incredibly consistent.
movies,fdpntln,t1_fdpmh4l,1578634038.0,It did what Jurassic Park (93) did but on a much much larger scale. It relied on both practical and CG only where practical couldn’t go. LotR marries both beautifully.

lotr,fdpdc2x,t1_fdotskk,1578625750.0,"I was curious about your comment so I looked it up because I’ve never seen these additional subtitles. I found these letters Tolkien wrote and in the post script of letter 136 is the only place I can find additional subtitle suggestions which I have never seen in any of the books I’ve owned or seen at friends houses. [Here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59d68c02c534a5079b390c38/t/5c2d3e3f575d1f37b45d4750/1546468936692/the_letters_of_j.rrtolkien.pdf) is a link to his letters and I’ll quote the post script below. 

> P.S. I have given some thought to the matter of sub-titles for the volumes, which you thought were desirable. But I do not find it easy, as the 'books', though they must be grouped in pairs, are not really paired; and the middle pair (III/IV) are not really related.
Would it not do if the 'book-titles' were used: e.g. The Lord of the Rings: Vol. I The Ring Sets out and The Ring Goes South; Vol. II The Treason of Isengard, and The Ring goes East; Vol. III The War of the Ring, and The End of the Third Age'?1
If not, I can at the moment think of nothing better than : I The Shadow Grows II The Ring in the Shadow III The War of the Ring or The Return of the King. JRRT."

Even the main actors at least rush through sentences/words when they are angry with the others or speak slowly and deliberately like Quint’s USS Indianapolis monologue. It also helps that a huge chunk of the movie used real people from Martha’s Vineyard for extras instead of actors.
