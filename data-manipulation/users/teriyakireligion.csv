I wish more directors took that approach.  Boyle had a neat little trick where he occasionally had the camera just a bit off,  which reminded me of the incredibly scary introduction to ""*The Haunting of Hill House*"" (Though Stephen King points out in ""On Writing"" that there's a suggestion that Hill House's architexture is just slightly, madly, a tiny bit off true.)

Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood for eighty years and might stand for eighty more.

I just thought of the Drill Sergeants as kinder,  gentler,  quieter nuns in different outfits.  The drills can't smack you over the palm with a ruler. 

&nbsp; 

Basic is very tough.  Prepare for that.  You will be sleep-deprived and worked hard 18 hours a day.  Do not hesitate to get dirty.  You will feel alone. You will feel like you are far removed from the real world.   Exhaustion increases whatever bad emotions you experience.  Be aware of that.  

&nbsp;  

The drills do not want you to fail.  They want to see what you're made of.  This is to your benefit and theirs.  You will be pushed physically and it will hurt if you're in bad shape.  Your boots will give you blisters,  you will sweat more than you thought possible, you will get muscle cramps and perhaps sprain a thing or two.  

&nbsp; 


Some people go to Basic and just can't hack it,  but the drills will want to make sure it's not just having a bad day.  A lot of it's theatre.  They've seen drama and hysterics and despair.  It is,  after all,  an abrupt and total change in everything you're used to.  I hit that point,  too,  and decided if I was going to put that much effort into something,  I was going to make a success of it.  It takes a lot of work to.wash out.  Sometimes your unit will let you exercise or whatever with them before Basic.  Do that if you can.  Ask LOTS of questions----but don't trust recruiters.  

&nbsp;

Whatever they ask,  give 10% more.  This is VERY important:  *do not be afraid to ask for help*.  NEVER try and hide a mistake.  Despite the yelling,  they want to make sure you are prepared for whatever may come. Let me stress that again:  do not try and hide an error,  a fuckup, or just....whatever. A good drill will respect that. 

&nbsp; 

Do not try and fake injuries.  You'll get branded as a whiner and faker. That is the worst.  If you do have some kind of discomfort or whatever,  power through it, deny it if asked, protest it's fine,  no big.  That's kind of cynical of me,  but we had a couple of hypochondriacs in my Basic,  and they were annoying as fuck.  I wound up spending the last week of Basic in hospital. 

&nbsp;  

Make sure you drink lots of water,  sleep as much and wherever you can,  pee whenever there's an opportunity that's better than a porta potty or the bushes,  pack a variety of bandaids and sunscreen, and remember, *this is temporary.*  Basic for the Army was ten weeks,  roughly,  when I joined.  Plus,  if you can get a language MOS,  grab it,  but know your limitations.  I was offered Chinese and took Russian.  Language MOS's can either be VERY boring office jobs,  or take you into the shit downrange.  Sometimes both,  in one day.

&nbsp; 

Now,  each of these links is representative of a larger problem.  The fact that cops are majority white and male is so basic a fact of life---that no wonder you guys need to scream ""fake news"" when you get triggered.  The police union has endorsed Trump twice.  There have been at least FOUR scandals where conservative white guy law enforcement groups have been discovered making hateful ""jokes"" about minorities,  and at least three scandals involving cops working alongside Reichwing assholes to falsely accuse and unjustly arrest people who had been victimized by the nlNazi-esque buddies.

Not that you give a shit,  given your squealing over basic facts.

You belong to that quarantined sub where scumbags worship that whiny wheeny orange scumbag who himself worships Putin, Kim, and Duterte.  As I pointed out,  you belong to :  ""HillaryforPrison""----which you did NOT address,  given that's SO very indicative of your Qanon-like delusions.

I like how,  like Trump,  when the facts are not on your side,  you resort to grade school insults,  but then again,  you worship the sort of guy like.....Trump.  That's it.

When I was at AIT,  we had a couple Olympic-level athletes in my company-----guys for whom a four-minute mile was a jog---and during company runs these guys took to grumbling because the training NCO put the shortest,  slowest people in front.  Company runs are about camaraderie,  not showing off. They'd grumble and mutter and complain nevertheless.  I was one of those slowpokes.

I didn't tell him that, but at some point he went out and discovered what it was. He was *incandescent* with rage.  The next time we had a company run, he dropped those guys and reamed then out,  and impressed upon them that if Mr.Olympic Trials did not understand the concept that ""Band of Brothers"" meant sisters,  too,  he was welcome to find a unit where showing off was more respected than camaraderie. And other things.

Our unit clerk did her first 15k ruck march 3 three months after delivery.  

&nbsp;

I broke my leg in three places falling on the ice at drill one day,  got it casted,  and came back on orders the next day.  Three months later I was in Ukraine in a walking cast.  

&nbsp;

According to you,  women don't do any of this.  

&nbsp;

Maybe you just close your eyes when they do,  because you really, really love to hate women,  it seems."
AmItheAsshole,feehicm,t1_feefxv3,1579033860.0,"And you're wrong.  

&nbsp;

We had 1(one) chick like that at AIT,  and 15 guys fucked her but never criticized the dudes. That's all they talked about, so after a while,  it felt like they were talking about 15 women.  Meanwhile two female soldiers got pregnant and married and kept right on doing ruck marches and PT tests.  Don't even *try* excusing that crap.  It'a guys like you that think one woman = all women."
AmItheAsshole,feeh3dq,t1_feefl9z,1579033624.0,"Yeah,  all too well.  I had had this silly twit of a therapist for six minths when she bestirred herself and asked,  ""But *why* do you think there are snipers everywhere?""  Bitch,  have I been talking to myself all this time?  

&nbsp;

Yeah,  I remember us pulling up to a police checkpoint on the Tigris, and it was just shot full of holes.  The river (or maybe it was a tributary,  who knows?) was in a very deep channel at that location and it was very narrow.  At the bottom was an upside-down Iraqi Police truck, also shot full of holes.  

&nbsp; 

We dismounted and looked for bodies.  Totally flat location,  and we were completely exposed.  It had been maybe three weeks since we'd gotten trapped in our very own road show production of ""Blackhawk Down"" so to say we were jittery was an understatement.  

&nbsp; 

And then we looked up in the direction of our home station,  and there was a huge mushroom cloud unfurling slowly over it. We were an hour away,  and that looked like a truly stupendous VBIED. (It was.) 

&nbsp; 

So we spent an hour driving into a certain shitshow,  after just barely escaping a shitshow  three weeks earlier.  It was a 120°,  and I was shivering as I kept trying to arrange my mags and my knife in just the most perfectly-accessible way on the way.  There was *another* VBIED as we got closer.  

&nbsp; 

And.....nothing. I think it was a trick of geography,  but the bombs weren't at our base. That was just one of many moments where my body was like, ""Well,  okay, *this time* we're going to die,  right?"""
AmItheAsshole,feefobm,t1_feed9n9,1579032797.0,"Yeah,  just like you're sure females get pregnant to avoid deployment and all a female has to do is cry one tear and she gets released from the detail she's on or whatever."

First ten years as a37F/Russian,  next ten years as an interrogator/linguist,  spending most days on those roads,  then coming back to the OMT and doing reports.  Talking to ordinary Iraqis just about every day.

And I don't know what he's yapping about when he talks about how some jobs don't involve danger.  In a small company,  people are going to have to do all kinds of shit.

I like to blow peoples' minds and point out that Muslims fought to *save* Jewish people during WWII, to the point where Imams were ordering their congregations to not take advantage of Nazi seizures of Jewish goods and other property.  It's amazing how utterly unknown that part of history is.

After actually serving in the Middle East,  where men and women both wear loose,  flowing robes in 136° heat,  I think the clothing originated as the best choice in that weather.  Religion *always* seeks to constrain women. 

&nbsp;

In the West,  we don't put hijab on women,  we just punish them for not doing it.  We enforce dress codes and there's a pretense,  but the mindset is the same for both groups on that end of the spectrum."

I had a guy in my squad catcall a girl while we were in civvies one day in town,  and when I raised my eyebrow at him,  the little fucknugget smirked and said, ""Sometimes I just can't control my dick.""  

&nbsp;

I grabbed him and hissed at him, ""Either *you* control it, *or I will*,  and if I have to, you will not want to *contemplate* fun for decades.""  I was so angry I nearly saw red. 

&nbsp; 

I *loved* the Middle East;  the people, the culture, the food,  the history. Maybe it was because I had been so misled, but that was not all of it.  I had a guy at the Iran-Iraq birder tell me he was ""a bad Muslim."" At the time,  I knew absolutely nothing about Islam,  so I thought I was about to be given all the secrets and blurted out,  ""Why's that?"" 

&nbsp;

""I like beer!"" 

&nbsp; 

""OMG,  I'M A BAD MUSLIM,  TOO.""

The guy called all the Iraqi police over, translated the little exchange, and they just about fell over laughing.  Dad jokes: the universal language. 

&nbsp;

And NOTHING of the sort appears on American TV.  ZIPPO. Zero.  Zilch. I remember driving by a man on the sidewalk who was being pulled along by two little girls in red velvet first-day-of-school dresses with elaborate white floofy hairbows on each pigtail;  they were swinging his arms so high that he got flung forward each time they jumped.  He had a huge smile on his face and the girls were obviously chattering at him a mile a minute.  

&nbsp;  


My ultimate feeling about veiling came one day when I was guarding a humvee during a meet. It was 120° in the shade. I was wearing a 3-lb., helmet with a scarf underneath it to contain the dust,  a gaiter pulled over my face against the sun,  a tee shirt, an overblouse, a 27-lb., flak vest whose plates were *not* designed for the female body, trousers with pockets full of magazines, wool socks, combat boots, and fingerless gloves to absorb sweat.  I was carrying a locked and loaded M-16,  which weighed seven pounds. My .249 was fixed on top of the vehicle.  I weighed a hair over a hundred myself,  and sweat ran in rivers down my scalp and whole body.  

&nbsp;

A lady in an abbaya and niqab came up to me.  She was wearing loose flowing fabric, red heels, red lipstick, and she had more exposed skin than I did,  plus way more ease of movement.  She had air circulating through the layers of fabric but I did not.  We chatted about the weather and hopes for rain and which market seller had the best lamb. Only my eyes and the tips of my fingers were exposed.  

&nbsp; 

 Who,  exactly,  was truly wearing the burka?"
