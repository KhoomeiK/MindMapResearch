Then, I questioned why a dragonborn would keep a secondary dragon ensorcelled in its staff. Like, if you're half-dragon and practicing magic, I'd assume the easier/better thing would be to just transform yourself, Zarasthrustra-(don't check the spelling)-style. Then again, she's dressed up enough to imply a level of pompousness (is she stepping on her own cape?) warranting summoning a minion from her staff, so it might fit her personality.

From a functionality standpoint, the book placement seems like it's holstered in a bit of an odd spot. Can't put my finger on it, but the way it's tucked doesn't make it seem easy-access.

It's not a skirt, or an undershirt, so is she just wearing a secondary more-open jacket under her first one?

Also, a little pedantic, but the pattern of the tie in the forearm bracer means it's secured by a singular string not looped around, in which case, it could be loosened by wiggling your arm, or is tied around the wrist on the interior and cutting off hand circulation.

Slow weapons deal lower DPS overall, and by virtue of being slow, trigger on-hit abilities less often. Worse, unlike other notable slow-hitting weapons, all three of these have basic heavy attacks. So, sword and Hammer wise, Lead Sled, Walloper, Guardian's Will, Hydraulic Sword, Husk Warper, Steam Roller, and Spectral Blade are better heavy melee weapons. The benefit derived from CNY weapons is almost 100% aesthetic.

0.5 Blast radius *is* super small. Worse, almost all sniprer rifles can roll with a headshot explosion perk, which due to headshot multipliers, does more damage than the CNY Sniper.

I tried to make these guns work, but unless your teammates are awesome or you're in lower-level areas, they can be a hinderance. And I theorycraft a boatload- I regularly rotate between about 2 ""tryhard"" builds and 20 ""Let's try this out"" ones.

Being one element is fine, but lacking the option to switch it is a bit of a downer, especially since it means you can't build a hero around the weapons, else the class'll only be useful against one specific modifier.

Being able to stun lock something is only valuable for Smashers, else you'd be better off using a gun that can... just outright kill it. The firecracker shotgun is fantastic for stun-locking enemies that would simply be dead near a Dragoon or either of the auto-firing shotguns. Same situation goes for the AR. And the only weapon of the bunch that reliably stuns a Smasher is the launcher... which has to be compared to other launchers in terms of crowd control, where it's still unfavorable.
