fatlogic,ffn4jtx,t3_eu4kfq,1580062013.0,That is so painful to read.   Just so painful.

Well, I’m the same size as I was when I graduated High School.  Slightly different shape with age and life, but same size.  I’ve been bigger, but that was due to a garbage diet and bad habits.

I’m pretty sure this (healthy BMI) size is where I’m supposed to be..."
fatlogic,ff94053,t3_esaim1,1579704300.0,"Cope with the day?  Ok, if you’re coping with one bad day in a blue moon, sure - beating yourself up won’t help.  But if you’re coping with every bad day several times a week... make positive changes in your life so you’re not having regular bad days and falling back on a food addiction to cope."

fatlogic,ff6j3lq,t1_ff674b3,1579628288.0,"It’s almost like this doctor has seen patients with similar bloodwork, size and health issues before.  Like they work with a community of people and can pick out clear patterns.  But how dare the doctor give perfectly reasonable, safe advice?"
fatlogic,ff6ipag,t1_ff63zir,1579628044.0,"Exactly.  Sugar is a sometimes food, but modern culture has turned it into an everyday, every meal food."

fatlogic,feku2s7,t1_fej9eyy,1579207615.0,If you they talk about a number on a scale without being triggered can they really call themselves fierce?
fatlogic,fe63ruo,t1_fe63nsi,1578881135.0,Oh!  Sorry!  Clearly none of their doctors business either.  I wonder how the housing rates are in Denial Land?

fatlogic,fchodu3,t3_ehael4,1577652398.0,Ffs.  Some people intermittent fast for health not weight loss.  Some do it because it makes them feel good.  Some do it because they have a busy stressful life and focusing on two good meals per day is just easier.  People can easily go 16 hours or more without feeling hungry.
fatlogic,fbyt2hu,t3_ef789z,1577225579.0,Why is it always “Go Google it yourself “ like they’re afraid of actually supporting evidence or references
