He went to Capone and asked to be let out. Capone bought him a new suit, gave him some severance pay and told him to never come back. Uncle Joseph then moved to Indiana and raised a family.

*To all of you asking about his last name; It is an Italian name starting with an ""R"" He was right off the boat from Italy and born in 1903. The story is that Mr. Capone took a liking to him. Great uncle Joe is the reason everyone in my family grows pumpkin flowers to eat. I didn't find out about his past until I was around 20 at a family Christmas. When I asked why not before....Mom replied; Back in the day it wasn't something you bragged about; something akin to being a drug dealer. Times have changed along with peoples romanticizing of the past. Uncle Joe was very popular and greatly loved by my family."

springfieldthree,fcnwsxz,t1_fcnokuw,1577820014.0,"From what I understand; It was Sherrill's closet that was a mess. You can tell by the pictures of Suzie'e room that the daughter was a typical messy teenager. So most likely her closet was the same as the room; therefore deemed typical and not noteworthy. However; The things that strikes me as odd are that; It is well documented that the 16-20 people who were in the house the next day said: That they tidied up the place. Emptied ashtrays and straightened up. If Sherrill was such a remarkable tidy person; Why was this necessary? Was there an unusual mess?
Also; If Sherrill again, was such a tidy person; Why was her closet a mess? Remarkably so. Both shoes and clothes were said to be in disarray. This seems out of the norm for Sherrill's personality. 
I think either the closet was also searched And/Or; The perpetrator Hid in the closet, when the girls arrived, with or without Sherrill (Who was most likely bound)"
DelphiMurdersTimeline,fcmpqvd,t3_crsvgj,1577786137.0,"First time I’ve read that the witnesses described the hat as a painters cap. 

Based on this and me looking at the video I would deduce that it is a military patrol cap in desert camo or multi cam. (Short brim, kinda odd as most are used to ball caps) 
https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/army-patrol-cap-set-obj/946779

Also; I think perhaps the jacket is some kind of military surplus. Maybe a MA-1. Notice the reflection off the left sleeve (zipper) and how it bunches around the waist?
