The production quality is normally basement bargain bin low, like so low it looks like it was shot on a handheld camcorder from 2004, and for some reason they always choose to shoot facing the fucking sun. Then there's the ones that they fuck up the audio on, most of the time it's cranked super loud with some jangley bullshit in the background that's the same volume if not even louder than the aforementioned cokefiend. My favorites by far though are the ones that the volume is too low. Like the audio engineer (probably the glue eater behind the parts desk) was listening to to it on headphones turned all the way up and thought, ""wow this is a lil loud I should pot it down a little."" Then pushing it out the door without having anybody with even half a brain cell seeing it. The end result is somebody whispering sweet nothings about buying a Kia in your ear."

Despite the fact that even the hardiest of vinyl stickers are easily defeated with 2 minutes and a fucking hair dryer. There’s obviously the problem of paint discoloration where the sticker was, but there’s almost no chance anyone would notice that unless they were actively looking for it. Not to mention who really gives a fuck about splotchy bits on a beige Toyota Corolla, or any other boring car that people who complain about stickers would drive. The only way putting stickers on your car could be considered a faux pas is if you’re  putting it on a car with especially rare paint, like a mystichrome Mustang. Even then, if the car doesn’t belong to you, what does it matter? It’s not your car, let the person sticker bomb it if they want."
