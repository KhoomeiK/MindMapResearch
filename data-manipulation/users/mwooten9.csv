DecidingToBeBetter,ffcigdr,t3_esplcw,1579800156.0,"I think self-compassion is a much better way to approach this. Bc what kind of love are we giving to ourselves. Love of a spouse or a dog or child or love of good food? Those are all different types of love. So when u say “I love me” my brain doesn’t know what to do with that. 

But compassion is wanting the very best life/outcome for someone, and willing to help them get to that point. Except this time the compassion is directed towards yourself. Where “love” will let u get away with more procrastination, self-compassion knows that’s bullshit and if you want to start living a better life, you’re gonna have to do the things you’ve been avoiding"

socialskills,fenctx2,t3_eptht5,1579281949.0,I seriously don’t understand this. Do u not even attempt to control your overwhelming irrational  thoughts. Any effort at all (mediation or breath work or a psychiatrist) because be very careful you’re not secretly loving being a victim. Gives u a perfectly good excuse for not doing the things you need to do. Be careful
