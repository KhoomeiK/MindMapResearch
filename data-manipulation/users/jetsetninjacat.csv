pittsburgh,ffd4794,t3_estuhb,1579813090.0,"Hey, it's my creek, the man lives along an unnamed tributary and not saw mill run creek itself. Its the houses by daniels alinement(yes, correct spelling). That tributary along provost and weyman has become so inundated from development further up it has actually eaten away the soil to the bed rock underneath. Whitehall still approved a dementia home further up which is in that watershed on provost and I did not see a water retention pond being built in. Further down 51 where overbook field is next to the closed school they are building another new office storage building. And on 51 agh just built a new medical center. We need to update and change our laws to help these issues. We need to require water retention systems if we are allowing businesses develop over green ways like the park or buidling newer structures. We also need to preserve what green way we can. We can dig and try to widen saw mill all we want but it won't stop the flooding from the loss of nature. The increase in rain has not helped but neither has the increase and development along areas like 51 which take up land that would help hold and soak up the water.


Edit: This is a [pic](https://imgur.com/pw1bmCY) from inside of the tributary. Puppy tax included. My neighbor grew up and lived in her house for over 85 years. She is the one who told me the creek bed used to be about 3 to 4ft higher and not as much water. Over the years it has gotten so much worse when it rains."

pittsburgh,ff5xqh0,t1_ff5x3sd,1579613700.0,Looking at the photos they shows a lot of old or broken guns. I imagine they have been handed down from family and most people don't know how to fix them or it costs too much to have someone fix them. In that case it might be cheaper to get the 100 and pay the rest for a newer one. Besides these gun back programs are the next best thing to surrending your broken old guns to the police who will destroy them.

That what we're considering. A high profile case, fbi labs, resources and budget, and access to chemical analysis from the product done during manufacturing or QA checks. I know certain products I will be inspecting that come with the analysis or as part of the certificate for the product."

todayilearned,femz7kp,t1_femxsx8,1579273348.0,"I think it depends more so on how much money would you be willing to spend to solve a certain crime. I dont 
 have a degree in chemistry but im sure someone can answer that better. I do know based on the paperwork I look at during inspection that companies like 3m usually contain a chemical analysis sheet with their products done during their QA. I imagine they keep that on file. If it was a simple murder i wouldn't see them spending that much to do it. But the unabomber was a high profile case and the fbi labs were involved. I'd say it's more than plausible. But once again someone more qualified can probably answer the fingerprint question."

todayilearned,femu9wl,t1_femh8bx,1579269769.0,"I work in a job dealing with this. 100%. Say we buy an epoxy from 3M directly. The certificate and epoxy itself contains batch/lot numbers. The supplier can track down who they sold it to and where. Even if we get the same epoxy from a third party it still comes with the paperwork and is still tracked to its original source. Even using the same ingredients, the chemical analysis of each batch will show differences. Find the batch that matches and follow the paperwork. Its the same way we get recalls on bad batches. The manufacturer will send memos to us if we got it directly from them or eventually the third party will as it takes them a bit more time. I can track down a screw batch manufactured in 2014 and used then if the manufacturer does a recall on it. Thats barring any human error on mixing parts or using an old part from a toolbox for the job card.


Edit: Example: A batch of bolts made in 2015 was found to be failing under stress causing accidents in chevys. The manufacturer is alerted and issues recalls. Using the lot numbers they alert all of the customers who bought them across mulitple industries. We can then go in the system and track every plane that has them on it and where. They can then issue new job cards and replace the bolts. If it was 4 screws on a panel and 2 different batches, we replace all 4 screws to be safe. Computers have made this job faster when it comes to tracking. And because of this, safety has inreased."

They raised money for the perpetrators family.  The common misconception is they dont pay taxes which is false. They don't pay social security or medicare but also waive the rights to them. Besides sometimes causing backups on small roads I've never had an issue interacting with them. And read about my edit with the handiwork and craftsmanship they do.

The old order are the ones against all technology etc. The old order had more split off to the mennonites and new order. Its just their religion. I partied with a few amish kids during and after my college years. They do get wild surprisingly.

Edit: They were on rumspringa and this was in Lancaster county PA area. I've been stuck behind a few buggies as well on the road in my day. A lot of it involves the fact if they don't go back to the community after rumspringa they are shunned and banned. Left alone on their own with no support. Some get medical training in higher ed but school stops around 8th grade and they start to learn trades. Their craftsmanship is well known and impressive."

He was there pulling men from the water from the Yorktown then the Hamman. When we visited the Yorktown at patriots point in the 1990s we met a man in a wheelchair being pushed by his daughter. She overheard my grandfather talking about the battle and asked if my pap would talk to her father. Her father was thrown overboard, covered in oil, and injured. He said a man on the benham has jumped in the water, tied a rope around him, and pulled him out. My grandfather was on the downed pilot recovery team and that was one of his duties on the ship. The man stated he was close to drowning and my grandfather could've been the guy puling him out. They both sat there crying and hugging while talking about it. One of my favorite memories. He died in 2018. I wish he couldve seen the new movie. He did like to correct stuff when we watched other pacific movies.
