AskReddit,fev01o7,t3_eqoio1,1579391630.0,"Because it does get better. I spent two and a half years straight in Maine's state psychiatric hospital. I had depression and anxiety/panic so bad I was psychotic at times. I thought my life would always be hell. I wanted to die. The only reason I didn't kill myself was that I was afraid of the pain and afraid of what lie after dying. It has been ten years since I was discharged. It was tough at first, but today I have some good days that make the bad ones worth enduring. Please talk to someone if you think of hurting yourself. I know it's hard now, but if you hold on and get help things can get much better."
