unpopularopinion,ffbryhx,t1_ffbrbr8,1579780439.0,"I do believe that more should be done. I’d love nothing more than one day earn enough to build a charity that helps people with dental or medical. I feel like the private sector may be the solution if the govt never steps in. There’s no regulation guaranteeing that if UBI was distributed that products wouldn’t just be scaled to make it null or that companies won’t just automate businesses and cut hours when forced to raise minimum wage. We need to do more to give Americans back their smiles and their health , especially if a lot are guaranteed to work in a low wage job they have no passion for. Seems demeaning. But, I think we need to make sure that whatever solutions are proposed have a fool proof plan and aren’t going to kamikaze us into a depression."
unpopularopinion,ffbrkda,t3_esmy5u,1579779970.0,"I think it’s crazy how many billionaire/millionaires in the US proclaim to want change but usually have some charity tied to friends, family, or themselves that make up the majority of their charity. I feel like if a lot of them were serious we would see the private sector jump in a lot of areas to help those on the lower economic scale. I see no issue raising taxes if that money is guaranteed to go back to helping the citizens in the U.S. We need transparency on taxes and lottery expenses in our gov’t."
unpopularopinion,ffbrcv7,t1_ffbkch3,1579779715.0,I see India pop up in lists of countries with free healthcare. Not sure what quality though.
unpopularopinion,ffbrajg,t1_ffbj663,1579779633.0,Both have a population of around 5 million. I’m curious to see how something like this would play out in America’s 327 million and immigration. Is there any country with a comparable population that utilizes socialist policies?
unpopularopinion,ffbr4e3,t1_ffbg39x,1579779423.0,When has there been references to China as capitalism?
unpopularopinion,ffbqpae,t3_esnfyr,1579778882.0,I’ve seen a few posts from girls that had posted there months prior for the karma. Seems crazy to me need that much of an ego boost. Recall someone deleting their posts after references to some nudes posted too.
unpopularopinion,ffbqldx,t3_esouff,1579778743.0,"I think people are fine with the climate movement until it effects  their wallets. I think we’ll see a people sing a different tune once its widespread. It’s almost a guarantee that either products will suffer in quality or increase in price to offset whatever losses companies face during these changes and pass those expenses off to the consumer. I would love to see more done with pollution, trash, etc even if my broke ass has to pay extra or not buy, but I definitely know a lot of people who’d outrage about these things. Look at how often a new device is released \*cough cough\* Apple. People jump onto the chance to replace a device that works fine and recently purchased to have the newest thing."
unpopularopinion,ffbq77d,t1_ffa9b4a,1579778214.0,"People hate the police, but fail to realize how bad shit would be without them. The media has made it a point to highlight cases of police officers abusing authority, which is fine, but they will cherry pick if it involves a person of color knowing the outrage. There’s definitely good and bad cops but the media isn’t going to report everytime someone has a good encounter. I don’t like being around cops, but I can understand my life would be significantly worse without a police force considering the persistence of crime in my neighborhood. Even crazier is some cities are combining the police and firefighters supposedly due to budget constraints but this seems even more dangerous considering it’s an added stress to an already intense job. I can’t imagine being a cop and having to wonder if a speeder you pulled over is grabbing his wallet or a gun, especially in today’s society that has people praising online when cops get shot up in their police car. I agree that certain things should be managed better but it’s takes very little for people to go up in arms as soon as the media plants the seed of possible racism. Body cams are a good addition."
unpopularopinion,ffbokw5,t1_ffbjq5n,1579775876.0,I see people I went to school with posting pictures of their kids then arguing with someone about robbing their stash of Xanax or OxyContin and I have to wonder how their kid is going to feel seeing stuff like that and also wonder how they even still have kids still in their possession. Supposedly it takes a lot before CPS steps in and does anything.
unpopularopinion,ffbo8jt,t3_esoim5,1579775363.0,People have to believe 100% that this is the child’s true wishes and not the parent embedding these ideas in the kids head. We live in a society that involves a lot of attention seeking on social media. I worry that someone caught up in the acceptance wave and wanting attention may punish the child for wanting to be it’s natural gender and rewarding it for other doing the opposite. It also seems like seems like a lot of parents applying stereotypes to the child’s activities. Who’s to say that the child doesn’t have a really strong male/female figure and is just trying to imitate someone they admire?
unpopularopinion,ffbnpdx,t1_ffbbb06,1579774561.0,"Would a doctor in today’s society be able to treat any gender dysphoria as a mental illness without risking backlash, especially if the parent is hellbent on having their kid get hormone therapy? Look at cases like Gypsy Rose and it’s clear that parents can have a lot more influence over treatments their child is getting even if they don’t need it. I just don’t trust that some people aren‘t just making decisions based on trends due to narcissism. Also, couldn’t blockers inhibit male genitalia growth Causing problems if a male child decides to remain as a male?"
unpopularopinion,ffb61hq,t3_esjfsk,1579752744.0,"This ones a weird one because I know as an adult this is popular to me but back when I was in middle school I wouldve been called a fag for joining drama stuff. Would’ve loved to do plays though, but inner city schools aren’t always forgiving for PoC ”showing weakness”."
unpopularopinion,ff7j740,t3_erx2x0,1579650810.0,"Completely accurate. Never forget that (white) right-wing Christian terrorism is the single most dangerous threat to people right guys?/s Im sure reddit has been just as vocal about religions like Islam and modern violation of human rights and acts of terrorism (see posts during nightclub shooting awhile back for comparison). This site is so ridden liberals scared to toe the line and hyperbole. Yes, you’ll be labeled a Nazi or white supremacist no matter what color you are on reddit if you don’t support Democrats. Pushing the idea that the hijab is empowering is also fucking stupid, CMV."
MorbidReality,fema74u,t1_fem0w2z,1579245620.0,People like this are truly irredeemable. It’s infuriating to know that down the line some technicality may lead to his freedom.
unpopularopinion,fem91y4,t1_fem88wb,1579244247.0,"Honestly, I think Bernie subs, Warren subs, Trump subs and even left and right based subs banning other opinions is whatever. Neutral subs however aren’t for neutral discussions anymore and they are policed so badly where there’s even moments of 90% of a posts comments being “Removed by moderator”. Posts get locked if certain mods don’t like where the discussion is headed regardless if it breaks rules. The same people insisting Trump would bring on 1984 and fascism are trigger happy when it comes to censorship and labelling others.  Its okay to hate nazis, but labelling every person that says something politically incorrect a Nazi is fucking stupid. Everyone’s walking on eggshells trying not to make some group or some person upset, too much crazy for me."
unpopularopinion,fem8d18,t3_eps2nr,1579243462.0,Yup. It is crazy to think of all the shit people protested over in the past decade and there’s been nothing to tell the people which politicians had been in Epstein’s pocket. These people are most likely getting their fix somewhere else now on the tax payers’s dime.
unpopularopinion,fem80tt,t1_fem7noq,1579243091.0,Ralph Northam and Justin Trudeau. I’m not trying to argue and what are some examples of fascism in those subs? Not everything needs to be banned and an obsession to police ideologies in supposedly neutral subs only results in displaying the beliefs of those controlling it. People don’t want to admit reddit used to be way more open for discussion not everyone needed to cry about something being left and right. Reddit feels more astroturfed than anything.
unpopularopinion,fem7kmp,t1_fem74ug,1579242611.0,"Ahh, yes. I forget how racist the right is with all the black face going on with the left. Google how many republicans have been called fascist and racist. Even Bush who the left somehow adores was once compared to Hitler. When people can’t defend their position or unaware what exactly their position is, they resort to name calling."
unpopularopinion,fem6z7z,t1_felvnxn,1579241984.0,Did you forget about reddit wanting to assault a kid because he was smiling?  So many on the left with victim complexes. One sub leans to the right vs the numerous amount of left wing populated  feel the need to cry about it and get it banned.
todayilearned,fem360t,t1_felmqjh,1579238218.0,How can they get one if they cannot afford one? Fix this and I’m all for it.
todayilearned,fem34r5,t1_felqf50,1579238186.0,"I wouldn’t say not true at all, but will accept that I may have been mislead.  Whether or not it has any truth to it is unknown. Regardless, how does someone with no income go about getting a liver/kidney/heart transplant with no money? Those being opted in without having the ability to receive is pretty shitty. I’m all for it if there’s a guarantee that those that cannot afford a transplant would still receive one if needed."
unpopularopinion,fellnm7,t3_epig6h,1579225137.0,"It blows my mind seeing how many privileged people complain about their lives in the US and how “bad“ it is. I’m no fan of big corps and I get that we need to fix things (outreach for homeless and unemployed, subsidies for medical and dental for those not on things like Medicare making under 20k annually) but having the freedoms a lot of us do is nothing to take for granted. Did no one on this site see the video on the gas canister embedded in the protester‘s head? People are literally dying in the 21st century fighting for freedoms we have in the US. I think the reason there’s so much outrage for small stuff is because a lot of  these people haven’t faced real adversity which is why there’s people on the left praising shit like  the hammer and sickle. How the fuck did the whole nazi dog thing create so much outrage considering some of the stuff that goes on in the world? So many people on this site foaming at the mouth to see something bad happen to the US just because they don’t like the president. That type of stuff is off putting coming from someone who was a big lefty growing up and thought Bush was Satan incarnate while knowing jack about politics."
todayilearned,felcfcl,t3_eppa70,1579218901.0,Even as a registered organ donor I can’t blame those that are hesitant when us poor folk are basically cattle for those that are wealthier. That Rockefeller guy has had 6 or 7 heart transplants from people even though he probably should have died a long time ago. People worry that their care will suffer if they opt in and it’s a fair concern to have in modern times when people are letting even things like politics determine how well they’d help someone in their care.
unpopularopinion,fdpznxn,t3_emim4o,1578647609.0,"People refuse to admit that once the canary died this site was filled with left-wing propaganda and censored to bring in the childen for ad revenue. It was not “always this liberal”.  Wtf are bernie ads popping up? Its crazy seeing so many American defend a country like Iran considering how lgbt and women have been treated. Also, there’s a lot of anti-Israel stuff for a site that calls everyone a nazi or anti-Semite."
OculusQuest,fbzx73i,t3_efe752,1577266519.0,64 for me.
