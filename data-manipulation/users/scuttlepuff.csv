AskReddit,fe7xb1w,t3_eo3mdi,1578920176.0,None in my opinion. Most of the lore is likely mistaken for real animals that people ran into and mistook for some legendary creatures. Bigfoot was probably a bear someon ran into that stood up infront of them ten foot tall (like a grizzly) .

I recall poo even saying it took him a few hours to beat one section of this during his adgq run of it. (When he first tryed it) . There are other hacks out there that are harder but almost all can be beat by these beasts. But these hacks were originally designed as challenges for tasers until runners realized they were humanly possible. You have a point that these specific hacks were intended to be done by humans. But my point was originally they were beyond human inputs at one time and it was amazing when these crazy fuckers decided to grind till they could stomp them
