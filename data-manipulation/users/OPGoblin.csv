AskReddit,ff807ig,t1_ff7p1k4,1579662599.0,Truth. When I was 24 I woke up to the smell of burnt piss and smoking electronics. Someone (had 4 friends over that crashed there) had woke up drunk n pissed on my ps1. Fuck was that nasty

AmItheAsshole,fetoi42,t3_eqhp46,1579377631.0,NTA - that's just a dumbass statement. Watch a single nature show about apes shed get it.
offmychest,feoo3fx,t3_epxeri,1579302838.0,I lost my dad a few yrs back and he had that whole men dont display emotion thing ( think it's the times he was raised in). Wish I had spent more time with him before but we didn't really have that. I know he loved me. My point is you made the right call OP. I'm happy for u
facepalm,fehs2zh,t1_fefkvzk,1579122758.0,Well I'm not talking about her going  back to school I was referring to the Congress comment. That part is laughable

AmItheAsshole,fds68he,t3_emtv14,1578695282.0,YTA . Dancing even that kind is and can be viewed as respectable. It's the person and their choices that make it not respectable.

AmItheAsshole,fdqhb08,t3_emetl5,1578666658.0,YTA. What the hell does it matter how they got together before you even existed. Like how does that effect your life in any way other than you wouldn't exist if they weren't together. Get over yourself OP. There are so many other ppl who have actual issues with their parents then making this my god

relationship_advice,fdmlxpz,t3_em0m1h,1578554965.0,She likes you already OP. Staying up talking that long and asking if you'd ever want relationship. Ask her man

offmychest,fcywul7,t1_fcywgge,1578088832.0,It's not that most are desensitized but you said it. Joking is how ppl cope.  With the current state of our government n the divided state of our union it's the only course some ppl have to deal with all that and now this. The thing most of us have been saying he was gonna do drag us into a war.
offmychest,fcywauk,t1_fcyvznh,1578088488.0,Agreed but your still pissing in the wind man. Ain't no one gonna stop making jokes. No one is being forced to read them.
AmItheAsshole,fcyvk6w,t1_fcyvhes,1578088016.0,Upvote for the reference and the laugh
offmychest,fcyv74n,t1_fcyuv87,1578087790.0,But ppl can care n still make jokes. I do it all the time. Even about personal bad things. You can't judge ppl off their internet humor. Some yes are uncaring but you dont know who is and who isn't and are getting riled up over something you can't change. I have family n friends who serve who could be affected by this and be shipped out and they are even joking too.  You need to chill man
offmychest,fcyu1l9,t3_ejlcuo,1578087074.0,Welcome to the internet. If you dont like what's said dont get on the highway.  Now dont get ne wrong I'm not joking about nor do I think this is gonna escalate to ww3 but anyone can joke about anything they want
AmItheAsshole,fcyksh0,t1_fcxyc2b,1578081813.0,Wow I wouldn't remain your friend very long if this is your attitude. Trying to police ppl phone activities. It's not 1982 man.
relationship_advice,fcy0n2y,t3_ejce3c,1578073098.0,Yes it's a huge red flag. Like the size of a 747. Hes putting all the responsibilities on you if you get pregnant from an act YOU BOTH DID.  Yes hes being honest but it's a dick move. This guy makes responsible guys look like shit. Tun from this relationship. His not caring won't end here.

AmItheAsshole,fc6hxe3,t3_eg6w2b,1577480986.0,Nah but is it really that big a deal to not read the ones your going to see with her. Just seems like this could be an easy way to make her happy or have her designate certain ones she would prefer you not to read ahead of time. Doesnt really seem like hill to die on
funny,fc6fn4s,t3_egg0i2,1577479445.0,You can't ruin a joke that isn't funny to begin with.
JustNoSO,fc638s6,t1_fc5z0eo,1577471268.0,It was the captialization of the word that made it seem he was referring to her friends
tifu,fc5h300,t3_ef4iar,1577457403.0,I'm from Springfield I know that club. It's a shithole lol. That made my day seeing a local story lol thanks
JustNoSO,fc59zya,t1_fc4xjyn,1577450490.0,At what point did she say they were HER friends? She said OUR friends. Not that I'm saying it makes it any difference but there some things lacking in this description. Did she say yes he could go and did it begrudgingly or is he going despite her request. This comes off as she told him to go but is sucking it up quietly.
