Anyway, here are my thoughts:


It shouldn’t be the standard to say “he does more than most dads.”   It should be the standard to say “he does as much as women.”   


And for him to say that he’s tired?   So are you!   For him to say that his job is more demanding than yours?   So if YOUR job were more demanding instead, does that mean HE would do more?   Anyway, that shouldn’t be the standard.  Equal contribution should be the standard!

As society becomes more accepting of LGBT, this might change over time, though.

workingmoms,fcgptnb,t1_fcfywoo,1577642832.0,"Youâ€™re not alone!   There are a lot of husbands who do similar things!


There was an article in the newspaper â€œThe Guardianâ€ about it.  Itâ€™s basically systemic sexism.   (NOT to say your husband is a bad person or anything!   I think a lot of it is unconscious, unintentional bias by well-meaning guys). 


Anyway, here are my thoughts:


It shouldnâ€™t be the standard to say â€œhe does more than most dads.â€   It should be the standard to say â€œhe does as much as women.â€   


And for him to say that heâ€™s tired?   So are you!   For him to say that his job is more demanding than yours?   So if YOUR job were more demanding instead, does that mean HE would do more?   Anyway, that shouldnâ€™t be the standard.  Equal contribution should be the standard!
