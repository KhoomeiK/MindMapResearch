Do you know where you're not allowed to own a gun? China, North Korea, Venezuela, and pretty much any other despotic dictatorship on the planet.

2. Again, since apparently your reading comprehension skills are weak, *the United States is not a democracy.* It is a constitutional Republic, if you can keep it.

Also, see #1 in regards to first world countries and private gun ownership.

3. The army had to be *built* for the Revolution, dingus, and they built it with private citizens and their privately owned guns. Which wouldn't have been possible if an authoritarian government had been able to prevent them from arming themselves.

Did you know that Thomas Jefferson, as a private citizen, owned enough naval artillery to completely level a coastal city?

Authoritarianism is a government telling the people ""we don't believe that you're intelligent enough to take care of yourself, so we're going to do it for you whether you like it or not."" Which is the same basic argument behind gun control laws, ergo the link to authoritarianism.
