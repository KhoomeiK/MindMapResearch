fatlogic,ffh04t0,t3_ethyno,1579919554.0,No but hyperventilating is very much a thing. And it isn’t really recommended.
fatlogic,ffgzy17,t3_etbmyx,1579919413.0,"Was just watching a video about a guy over 1,000 pounds by one of those weird channels like “the talko” or whatever(I don’t think it was that one, but a similar one)... they said how people being that big is often the result of a condition like hypothyroidism because you can’t just eat that much... okay. Cmon, hypothyroidism is pretty common, it is not common to be 1000+ pounds. Hell even with obesity rising, I doubt it is that common to be 400-500+ pounds. 

It just really annoyed me, especially because from the context of the video, it doesn’t sound like the guy actually even had a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. So it wasn’t even excusing his weight due to a condition, which would still be annoying. It was making a general assumption with no actual reason aside from hypothyroidism could maybe lower your TDEE a bit. There was absolutely no reason to even include the bit about it being “hard to eat so much” and hypothyroidism in this video since they said that there was no info on how he became so large so they were guessing. I’m just really peeved that people continue to spread this bs.


Oh, and weightloss tik toks have become a thing and in almost all of them, I see comments of girls saying “it’s not that easy, I gained 70 pounds from my birth control even though I didn’t change my diet at all”..... ughhh, somebody help me not get legitimately angry at this."
fatlogic,fe9e8u8,t3_enu47t,1578936783.0,"I always think it is funny when they say a doctor should only ever address what you are there for... that isn’t exactly how that works. 

By that logic if you go to the doctor because you hurt your arm playing football and they notice something wrong with your skin that you believed to just be dry skin but is actually potentially more serious, they just shouldn’t say anything? 

If you go to the doctor for hemorrhoids but they notice you have abnormal discharge that could mean infection in your crotch, they shouldn’t say anything?

Doctors need to address potential health concerns. 

Also, don’t these people ever go to the doctors for yearly physicals where you are literally addressing potentially anything and everything at once. Technically, I’d think anything health related falls into their jurisdiction there(pretending it didn’t already) since the entire point of the visit is literally anything pertaining to overall health."
fatlogic,fd5mahf,t1_fd31p3x,1578179010.0,"Yeah, it is pretty strange. I thought maybe they were highlighting specific muscle region outlines or something... it really does look super odd though lol"
fatlogic,fd2xnlu,t1_fczlaxg,1578152761.0,"I think it might just be because that option is highlighted because the left side is red too, so maybe it adds a bit of a tint or filter."
fatlogic,fczajzs,t1_fcymsq4,1578097019.0,"I mean, to a certain extent it is separate, like you said. 

If someone says “I don’t eat cheese because it upsets my stomach” it sounds normal. It would sound a bit odd to hear “I don’t eat cheese because it upsets me” lol

But yeah, with these people they describe it like your body is it’s own individual being. I really can’t grasp it. Shouldn’t they realize when they choose to do something, their body feels it? If I hit my hand with a hammer, my hand isn’t angry, I feel it and I am in pain because it is part of me."
fatlogic,fcz9mes,t1_fcyo7sn,1578096461.0,"I know, it’s so annoying. I did really well making sustainable changes before but I’m finding it really hard to do that now. I don’t really know how I screwed it all up the first time. Too nervous to step in the scale though. Good luck with your weight loss."
fatlogic,fcykbrr,t3_ejgni9,1578081563.0,"Every time I get under 150, I lose control and gain again... feels totally impossible to lose weight or reach even a healthy weight range(being under 128)... I don’t get it. I don’t understand my compulsive need to eat. And recently all I wanted is salty and buttery foods"
fatlogic,fcyjf3v,t3_ejh2md,1578081062.0,"One of the biggest coping skills my therapist has told me is “manage your input”. She says that obviously I need to learn to cope with things in real life but I also need to learn how to relax without being around things that are stressful or anxiety inducing.

No part of managing my own input includes telling other people to stop posting or sharing certain things. If I was truly that worried about it, it would be up to me to just not go on social media at all. 

So if something I say or do triggers you, sorry, but that isn’t my responsibility. I am not walking up to you, pinning you to a wall, and screaming it in your face so that you can’t get away."
fatlogic,fcyiw6v,t3_ejil8p,1578080801.0,"Now, I don’t know about Carrie’s height and weight specifically, but I hate when people talk about losing large amounts of weight and they say “that sounds like a lot for your height”... uh, what? Your goal weight should be dependent on your height. The amount you actually need to lose to reach it is dependent on your starting weight, not your height. 

When I started and said I wanted to lose about 80 pounds and people pretty much did say “that’s a lot for someone your height”. Yeah, well, being 180 pounds is also a lot for someone my height. It’s almost like that is exactly why I need to lose so much."
fatlogic,fcyiaei,t3_ejjy31,1578080604.0,"It was was bad enough when they were separating themselves from their bodies by constantly saying “living in a larger body” and what not, but oh my gosh, this is ridiculous. How does one ask their body for consent? Does your body consent to overeating, eating processed junk, or a lack of exercise? 

This is full blown delusional to truly believe that your body is that separate from you. It reminds me of when I was 6 and I got my haircut and cried because I thought the hairs I cut off were going to feel bad that I abandoned them. But these are grown adults."
fatlogic,fciry46,t3_ehb9jz,1577668394.0,They said even one instance... are they implying if you wake up late for work and skip breakfast your cardiovascular system is immediately damaged?
fatlogic,fbepyhn,t3_ecn75k,1576791226.0,"I love how thinner people are “skinny bitches” most of the time but “thin allies” when they want them to defend fast people so fat people don’t need to do the work... it’s typing sentences, if you can’t even do that for your own cause, come on..."
