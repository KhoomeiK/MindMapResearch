technology,fczx3dr,t1_fczngxm,1578110110.0,"To clarify, when I say juggernaut, I am referring to the manufacturer, not any individual dealership. Obviously there are some massive dealers and dealer groups that make more sales in a month than a small privately owned dealer could make in 6 months. But dealers can’t really turn a profit giving away their already-slim margins on the vehicle, which is why they get so slimey with the hard sales pitches on aftermarket products. 

The dealers selling cars at the lowest prices are able to do so selling insurance, extended service contracts, (in-house) financing, or even through owning the real estate on which they operate. 

There of course were times when someone’s first offer was acceptable, and- after a couple at-bats- not getting them to budge resulted in me taking the initial offer. But it was never a “take this number or I walk” conversation. Then again, I wasn’t telling them some nonsense like “we only sell at retail”, so... 

The issue is that almost everyone bringing an offer to buy thinks they have a realistic number. But many of these people are thousands (sometimes tens of thousands) off from reality. So salespeople cannot take their earnest research to heart. 

Alternatively, many other think they researched a good deal and left hundreds (sometimes thousands) of dollars on the table. And where one dealer will sell a car at $XX,XXX, another may be happy to sell it for thousands less. It is just a conversation- one that should be held with at least two dealers on similar vehicles (but not the exact same VIN), whenever possible. 

Lastly, low-level sales reps **have** to take all offers to their desk. The salesperson doesn’t know how much a manager will sell a car for that day. Only the manager desking the deal knows what incentives they have, where they are in reaching their sales goals for the store/rep/managers, or any other factors affecting the decision to move that into (inventory, day supply, allocation eligibility, flooring costs, etc.). Sales reps don’t go to the desk for theatre. Most are barely more than mouth-breather ping pong balls sending notes between the buyer and manager. But the manager can’t (and doesn’t want to) work the deal directly with the customer, because they have too many customers and other duties. Good salespeople can quickly walk through the negotiation in one or two passes. But then you can pull the strings easier on a new salesperson than on a seasoned one."
technology,fczk3nh,t1_fczhxe7,1578102973.0,"Dealerships absolutely are inefficient- for many reasons including, but not limited to the negotiation process. 

Maserati sells a car at $20k below sticker, because they are competing in a certain segment (exotic/luxury), so they need to represent that with their comparative price point, but they are a shit product that can’t compete with the alternatives in the segment. So they say “you’re getting a $110k car for $89k- such a deal!”, rather than saying you’re getting a $90k car for $89k. 

As a sliver of the market, Maserati relies on high margins to turn any kind of profit. The juggernauts of the market- Toyota, Honda, etc.- can afford to make smaller margins selling exponentially more units. 

BMW has high margins on the high-end model, too, but subsidizes those with the X1 sales. Niche models like the M6 are very low volume, with manuals being ever more rare. So throwing money on the hood to move them is expected and acceptable. For every M6 BMW has to discount $20k with dealer incentives, they sell 20 M8s with great margins. 

Would BMW sell more M6 models with a $20k lower MSRP? Sure, but then they would have to lower their 650i MSRP by $20k, then their 5 series, then 4 series..."
technology,fczex0w,t1_fcyv0vk,1578099699.0,"This is a lot to filter through, so I may not address all of it. But the overarching theme of your experience is that you did not want the dealer to negotiate. You want them to accept your below-asking offer or not. That is not how it works. You would end up going from dealer to dealer, until you slowly increased your own price point; to then circle back around to the same dealers, offering a little more, then a little more. Eventually, one will say yes. 

But this is both flawed and foolish. For one, you are expecting a dealer to say “yes” on the first offer of a negotiation (for less than asking). For a dealer to say yes on the first go means they were very comfortable with that offer. So you would not have gotten a very competitive price. How confident would you feel about your research if a dealer was overjoyed to accept your offer? If you saw them high-fiving each other over your offer, you’d feel like you got taken. 

For another thing, it takes way more effort to take your approach, rather than get an idea of what you’re willing to pay and haggling with a couple of dealers (via email, if possible). 

It is just unrealistic to expect someone tasked with selling something as high as possible to take your first offer. Salespeople aren’t paid to decline an offer then walk away. 

Also, most people start lower than their actual walk-away price, hoping to get an exceptional deal, and acknowledging that there is some back-and-forth in the process. 

You can find auto retailers who offer “one-price” models. But I put that in quotes, because it really just means “one price for this week”. This is more common with used cars, as they are not effected by lease and finance incentives, inventory flooring fees, days supply, etc. The one-price new car dealers I work(ed) with are ALWAYS priced higher than the dealers willing to negotiate. Go into any Carmax or AutoNation (for used cars) and they will happily take your first offer... as long as your first offer is their asking price. 

Now, is lying a good, ethical, or even effective negotiating tool? No. But no one is claiming car salespeople are the most savvy salespeople. But it is unfortunately very common for both the buyer and seller to lie to each other. So, while gross, it should at least be anticipated. And with no relationship established (referral, expected return business, etc.) honesty comes down to the individual’s morals. 

I lost many sales to other salespeople/dealers who were fine feeding the customer a line of BS. And I have been called a liar because I told a customer something they didn’t want to hear. And I still realized great success in that part of my career. But I never could get through to the occasional “this is what I will pay, take it or leave it” buyers. I have distinct memories of a couple of these people wanting everything laid out with my bottom line. Then, when provided with that, they still expected a discount somewhere."
technology,fcyhlvy,t1_fcy4n80,1578080296.0,"I’ve been on the retail and b2b side of sales in both automotive and software sales. I can tell you that there is no standard for negotiating, so if you desire ANY option to negotiate, you’re opening Pandora’s box. 

Buyers lie at least as often as sellers. That you think lies are a (shady) tool only sellers use is naive. 

If you don’t like [enter any example] negotiation, then pay retail. It’s that simple. The fact of ~~desired~~ ~~expected~~ demanded a discount shows you were interested in and open to negotiating. 

That you think *you* knew the market is funny. Almost everyone thinks that. Just like most people think they are above-average drivers, it isn’t true most of the time; many people enter a negotiation “knowing the market” with unrealistic expectations. Maybe you were spot on, but no salesman worth their salt will give your proclaimed market knowledge any weight until they have taken a swing at you. It is their job. 

Now, I am ALL FOR automotive retail pricing charged the same to all. But reality gets in the way in a few ways:
- manufacturers need to sell extra inventory, creating seasonal and regional discounts to some and not others. This already happens in auto sales (regional dealer cash, model year end incentives, loyalty customer rebates, etc.), but buyers get hung up on how much the dealer will discount. so you STILL wouldn’t pay the same price as everyone else, because you might live in a region with lower supply. 
- manufactures are selling in a hyper-competitive space, and depend on salespeople to sell their product against those of their competitors. Why buy a BMW over a Lexus? Most regular Joe consumers don’t research every aspect of such a complex product and depend on someone to sell them based on their buying motivations. 
 - BUT manufacturers don’t want to operate in the dealership space, so they create a franchise model. This requires another layer, with their own costs and need for profit. 
- This eventually lead to dealers competing with each other, offering deeper discounts to move the same product. Now we live in a market where discounts are expected."
