atheism,fcziobq,t1_fczcl1a,1578102094.0,"This is suppose to be forum about ""atheism, agnosticism and secular life"".  Are you saying that without ""religion is bad, look how bad it is"" the only content you'd have would be ""God's not there, bye""?"
atheism,fczhohy,t1_fczfclu,1578101482.0,"We as in ""atheists"". I'm an atheist, whether or not you like it or believe it. Please shove your gatekeeping really far up. 

And let's be honest, its obvious why you have troll problem. You like being trolled. You see trolls everywhere. Fuck, you made a scoreboard. My grandma pulls up similar thing when she talks about how catholic church is ""oppressed"" in Poland. I see no difference between you and cathonazis."
atheism,fczekke,t3_ejo485,1578099434.0,"It is hard. But it was not my death that gave me sleepless nights. It was much harder for me to get over the death of our universe. I used to find comfort thinking about universe in terms of eternity. It would mean that whatever I do during my life might ripple out through time, thus it matters. But if universe dies, it's all pointless anyway.

I freaked out. But shortly I realize how stupid it was anyway. Humans will be lucky to get another century before they blow themselves up."

atheism,fcz6yn4,t1_fcz69cn,1578094922.0,My personal experience is very much unlike yours. Me being assertive ends up with a giant fight. It's like ppl feel that questioning believes can go only from Christian to atheist and not other way around. But nevertheless I appreciate your point of view.
atheism,fcz6a67,t1_fcz66k3,1578094533.0,I'll check them out. Thank you!
atheism,fcz5x4w,t1_fcz4knc,1578094319.0,There is no point debating with Evangelicals IMO. They tend to stick to their opinions no matter what. On the other hand alienating ppl that are somewhat more open minded seems counterproductive?

relationship_advice,fcwx4lf,t3_ej3aq7,1578041369.0,"First, I'm sorry you have to deal with this so late in your relationship. 

I strongly disagree with her point of view, but since I don't know her story, i won't make a judgment. That being said, in XXI century, saying that men has sole responsibility for providing for the family is in my opinion absurd and I don't believe you should take this burden on your shoulders. You need to take care of you, just as much as she needs to take care of herself. 

If you are happy together, I'd try to work out a compromise. You can start a shared account where each of you puts part of your paycheck. Whatever she has left after, is hers to do as she please.

Or if you have the resources, you could say you will pay for food and shelter(rent/mortgage/bills or whatever) but anything above that must be shared (clothing, vacation, cable, internet etc).

Third option that would be somewhat acceptable to me would be having a prenup that basically states that since you are solely responsible for providing for the family, everything goes to you in case of divorce.

Lastly, if she is unwilling to compromise in any way, I think you should move on. Vast majority of women understand that family is about working together and not having a partner that provides for them. I wish you best of luck and hope that whatever you decide will bring you happiness."
