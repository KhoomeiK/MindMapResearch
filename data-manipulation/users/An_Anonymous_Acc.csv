>Pearson is awful to fly out of, City Center isn't really much of anything unless you're going around the east coast. It's a cut below world class cities.

Idk how much you fly, but it's one of the best airports I've ever been to; and I've been to most cities you likely consider world class. i.e. Compare it to new york's airports. JFK is the only one that can even compete with Pearson. 

And just FYI, Pearson is the second most internationally frequented airport in North America"

What makes Toronto not a world class city?

It has 3m+ people, $150b GDP, the HQ of many fortune 500s, two airports, two train lines, subway lines, is one of the most technologically current cities, and has one of the highest standards of living.

Because it caused us to go into a recession as well.

&#x200B;

Also because our real-estate market is clearly inflated, regardless of our banks' regulations. One of the main causes of the recession was a sudden drop on inflated housing prices, causing more mortgages to go into default, and further causing a snowballing effect that affects all areas of finance. I'm no economist but it's easy to see the parallels between 2008 and now."
