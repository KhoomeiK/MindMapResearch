I was a very shy, overweight, passive kid who had never gotten in trouble but was picked on regularly up to my first year of Jr. High. Then I finally decided to stand up to a bully. The fight lasted about a minute, no one was seriously hurt, and we both  got suspended for two days for fighting. 

When my mom picked me up in the principal’s office, and she heard what happened, she said, much to the chagrin of the principal, “It looks like you earned two days of vacation”.

That day changed my life, I never got picked on again, I got engaged in school and life in a way I hadn’t previously, and I never got in trouble in school again."

Then stop. That is all you have to do. Stop. Stop calling to wake him, stop pushing him to go to classes and seek an education, etc. 

You are the one who thinks having a decent education and being a responsible adult are important, he doesn’t. And he has no reason to think any differently, because you do everything for him - his actions have no consequences for him. You are the one with the problem, not him. 

You are trying to salvage a relationship you never had. You intentionally involved yourself with a emotional infant, and then expected him to be a man. Then you took care of him like an infant, and expected him to magically change into a man. 

There is only one way he will ever be a man - and that is when he chooses he is tired of being poor and dependent and useless. 

Maybe in the future this will happen. There is no way to know for sure. It certainly won’t happen with you changing his diapers.

And the only way you can know the person you are in a relationship with is mature and shares your values and priorities is if they are already mature and living according to those values and priorities when you meet them.

But that isn’t the right way, that is the Western (and historically speaking, rather new way) of finding a mate. And as a Westerner I can tell you such relationships can fail and be as lonely and as isolating as any others in history. We don’t have a special handle on a better kind of relationship, just a preference. Just read Reddit for a bit and you will see how often and how badly they fail.

And it’s funny we will let an app suggest a possible mate, but not our parents or communities. As if an algorithm knows us better.
