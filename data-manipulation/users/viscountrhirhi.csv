I like taco meat made from quinoa and spices.

I don’t usually like meat alternatives that are too “real” because I wasn’t big on meat in the first place (the taste and texture icked me out, and the fats and tendons and bones and veins and skin...euuuuugh!

In the center of the circle was an old rug he’d found. He would just go out and lay on his rug at the center of the circle, surveying his collection. Mom would clean the circle up, but he would just rebuild it. We knew if we were ever missing something that all we had to do was look for it in his circle.

We joked he’d built an alien landing pad. :D

-whenever he heard cars, or especially motorcycles, he went nuts and would run laps in the backyard, doing the sheltie-spin (a tight spin multiple times that looks like he was chasing his tail—somehow he didn’t get dizzy!) on each lap. He also took to “chasing” airplanes, birds, and even shooting stars during meteor showers in this manner. The meteor shower one was especially amazing. He was always looking to the sky. (:

-he wasn’t allowed on mom’s bed. And he knew this. It was forbidden and that made it tempting, however! He behaved when she was home, but once she left, the first thing he did was race to her room and roll around in bed, grunting and growling and having a great time. xD

I also drank the koolaid believing farm animals could ever live happy, humane lives. The farm industries are good at their propaganda.

This was a decision I made after seeing that it is hypocritical for me to view certain animals as friends and others as food, when the only thing deciding that for me is...culture. The animals themselves are no different—cows are as playful and intelligent as dogs, pigs are even smarter (on par with 3 years olds), and even chickens are affectionate and show empathy. Culture decided that we eat one and befriend the other—after all, cats and dogs are eaten in some parts of the world, and some cultures view cows as sacred. There is nothing inherent about any of this.

Change is happening. The dairy industry is plummeting. Veganism is surging in the UK and growing elsewhere. Maybe it won’t go away completely, but more and more people are definitely waking up—I was one of them.

And ethically speaking, you're being really shitty and lazy.

If you truly lack empathy, it is up to you to seek help and teach yourself ethics, at the very least. There are plenty of vegans who feel nothing for animals, but who are still ethical vegans because even without empathy, they can still recognize that it is the right thing to do and that nothing deserves to suffer or die needlessly.

There are numerous studies showing that eating meat even once or twice a *week* drastically increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, various cancers (especially prostate), and many other diseases. Eating eggs even twice a week also radically increases the risk.

We weren’t exactly studying the effects of their diets back then, either, as the tech and knowledge wasn’t around then.

According to my last doctor visit, all my bloodwork was phenomenal, my blood pressure was great, etc. But aside from that, a lot of my long term health issues cleared up a few months into being vegan.

Humans were never designed to consume the amounts of meat modern people do. And modern humans don’t even need animal products at all to thrive, definitely not in a world of grocery stories and plant-based alternatives. In fact, going by the studies, animal products actually hurts our health instead. We can’t really compare our “eat anything you can get ahold of because you may starve the next day!” ancestors to our modern selves—they didn’t live particularly long, either.

It just baffles me that some folk can’t seem to grasp the concept of liking a character without *endorsing* them.

I love writing, and I love exploring human nature, and I also like giving my protagonists a good foil/obstacle to overcome. Complex antagonists and villains who are human and even relatable, even a bit sympathetic, are way more interesting to me than Capital E Evil villains. I love exploring what made them how they are, and villains in stories often get some really interesting arcs and often have big personalities that are super fun. And I think what makes them fun, even when they are awful, is how their worldview is soooo polar opposite from mine.
