facepalm,fe090tx,t3_encovo,1578806424.0,This kinda shit is why her and Harry stepped down. The country and the monarchy are racial purist and racist as fuck. Proof that “Great” Britain still lives in the 1800’s.
harrypotter,fdpsgsp,t3_embpur,1578638728.0,This is the best use of this meme I’ve ever seen. Well done.

Even if Iran wants to declare war, the US will squash the Iranian opposition like a bug with remote drone strikes and special ops, so there will be no war."

harrypotter,fd1flsw,t3_eju4gg,1578130812.0,"Slytherins aren’t all evil. Sure they may have traits that point to them being that way, but it isn’t a direct correlation.

I’d suggest reading the books for more explanations. Slytherin’s like Professor Slughorn, Andromeda Black, Regulus Black, and arguably Snape are good at heart."
