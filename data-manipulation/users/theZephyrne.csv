fishkeeping,fcssmev,t1_fcsrrjr,1577924079.0,"Just rinse out the fish tank, fill it with water and let it sit with the filter running and the heater. The good bacteria that will make their home in your water and make it safe for fish eventually exist in the air and will naturally find their way into your aquarium. They just need time to colonize in there so that there is enough of them to keep up to eventually eating the toxic waste produced by your fish. So I’d get started with filling your tank and getting the filter in it running, and from there you can look into the whole cycling thing so you better understand when it is safe to add fish."
fishkeeping,fcski9c,t1_fcs0uul,1577918414.0,"Yep you definitely need a heater if you’re gonna have a Beta fish! Or most fish for that matter. Make sure you read the heater details carefully when you’re buying one, since you want to make sure it will be big enough to heat that size of tank. Kind of hard to tell but it looks like I dunno...maybe 30 gallons? Have anything size wise to compare it to or do you know how big it is?

Betta fish are cool - but one betta in that tank will look super empty so id say you should add more! Youll just need to choose VERY carefully it’s tank mates as they’re super aggressive. I’ve had a lot of success keeping female Betta fish with Neon Tetras. 
Corydoras are awesome little fish that clean your tank really well. 
Get some Nerite Snails too - they clean your glass and are easy to take care of and they won’t make babies and get out of control.  
Shrimp are also awesome but incredibly sensitive and your betta might try to snack on them. You need like a special shrimp sponge filter and everything to make sure they don’t get sucked up. I might save shrimp for a ways down the line when your tank has been established for a while and maybe you can do some research on keeping them :)

Some stuff I’d recommend getting and doing right away:

1.) Get API’s Freshwater Master Test kit - you need this to know when your tank is cycled enough to be safe for fish. If you can’t get this now (it’s about $45 or so) if you can’t get this then at least try to find an Ammonia test kit. (Any ammonia in fish tank = very bad news for fish)
2.) MOST IMPORTANT - Google everything about the Nitrogen Cycle in an aquarium/How to cycle a fish tank because this is probably one of the MOST important things you learn. If you don’t properly cycle your tank first, you’ll buy that gorgeous Beta fish and tetras and they won’t last long, I guarantee it. I’ve made this mistake. :( Seriously once all this makes sense to you, you’ll be unstoppable in your aquarium hobby flights of fancy! 
3.) You have got to cycle that tank before anything else (google) , it takes a while - so I’d get started! My 6.5 gallon (very tiny) took about 3
weeks. Bigger tanks take longer. You can buy stuff at the pet stores called Biological Aquarium Supplement which will jump start your cycling but it’s not necessary. (This is why the master test kit is so important - it’ll help You know when your tank is ready for stocking your fishies) 
4.) I wouldn’t worry too much about the calcium on the filter. It’ll just come back and it’s near impossible to get off. Give the whole filter a good rinse and a scrub with a sponge (with just water) and it should be good. I stopped trying to clean the calcium off of mine, it hasn’t hindered the flow at all yet. I guess You could try chipping at it gently with a knife or soaking the spots using vinegar water but be super careful it’s fully rinsed off after because you want absolutely none of that vinegar getting into your fish tank. 
5.) Get yourself some sexy decorations and rocks at the pet store! Get really creative I mean the more the better - fish will feel more comfortable with lots of places to hide. You can play around with this fun stuff while your tank cycles...while you research things etc.
6.) Be patient - the cycling takes a while and it’s easy to jump the gun and put fish in there before it’s ready.

PlantedTank,fck4olu,t1_fcjvspf,1577716498.0,"How do you go about diffusing the co2 into such a tiny tank? Did you buy a diy co2 setup kit? Do you regulate it at all or do you just let the co2 flow?
