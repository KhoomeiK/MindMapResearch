Nazis = socialists

NoStupidQuestions,fd2kwog,t1_fd1u1p0,1578148692.0,"Yes to the first part, but not necessarily to the second. Maybe you’ll have difficultly learning/or remembering, but I think people who learn second languages tend to understand the rules of that language much better than their native one.


Native languages are learned mostly outside of academia. We learn from our parents, other family, friends, etc. Sure, you learn the grammar in school, but then—at least for me, an American—the native language class becomes a literature class more so than a semantics class. So the focus is now on reading books, writing essays, and discussing things like “symbolism.” 

Plus, when you’re a native speaker, you’re allowed to change the language. Maybe you still *write* then and than, but you pronounce them the same way. Slang, accents, etc. English isn’t just one language, not really.

Edit: a word"

Also, did you discuss engagement/marriage before he proposed? Or did he just ask? I mean, yes, engagement is more flexible than marriage, but I’m sorry, I don’t see how either of them is a good idea if a scrapbook of an ex is enough for you to consider calling it off."
AmItheAsshole,fcfl6wt,t3_eh6oks,1577631211.0,"Uhm, I don’t really know how to judge this, because, ultimately, it’s your decision whether or not you’re with someone, but...

Why are you engaged? You’re both in your early-20s and have been dating less than a year. You agreed to a long engagement so as not to rush things, but honestly, getting engaged seems pretty rushed. Especially be abuse your communication seems to be lacking severely. Why not ask the person you’ve committed to commit to why he has this scrapbook? 

Maybe it’s because he has fond memories with this ex and sees no reason to throw the scrapbook out. We all have things from our past. Maybe he is still pining over her, in which case, yes, it’s totally fair to end your engagement, but that’s something only *he* can answer, not us. You need to talk to him and figure out what your next steps are. Work together as a couple to figure this obstacle out."

offmychest,fc5hytd,t1_fc5hfkm,1577458109.0,"I understand that it’s technically grammatically incorrect. I’m not arguing that those words in that order should mean what they mean grammatically. I’m just saying that it was a longer phrase that got shortened but the meaning persisted. For example, some people just say “two birds” and have dropped “with one stone,” but people understand what it means. That’s why I think it’s different from simply speaking/writing incorrectly (e.g. good instead of well)."
offmychest,fc5gvnm,t1_fc5gi64,1577457242.0,But those examples are just grammatically incorrect. They don’t stem from a saying that would explain why the current phrase is grammatically incorrect.
offmychest,fc5g04j,t1_fc55njo,1577456516.0,"Okay, so then here’s a question. If the original phrase has just been shortened and people know what you mean when you say “I could care less,” does it *matter* that it’s technically grammatically incorrect? 

This is the interesting thing with language. There are rules, but those rules can change/be bent if enough people “agree” to it."
