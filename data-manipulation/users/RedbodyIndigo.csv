facepalm,fdbx967,t1_fdbr82k,1578263363.0,"I understand how you came to the first conclusion, but how in the big blue world did you figure I didn't read the article? The ariticle is about the epidemic of homelessness is Vancouver due to a lack of affordable housing and calls for government action to assist with this issue to and provide mental healthcare for those afflicted. It does not even mention this 1 and 4 statistic nor gender, whatsoever. If the guy above me had read it, he would not have commented that the article was about the difficulties homeless women face in any regard other than affordable housing, so...I said they need to read the article.
