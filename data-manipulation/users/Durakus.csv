Not prove NO GOD exists. But certainly proves the god, as described, does not.

Of course, varying degrees of crazy can refute your evidence, but it doesn't mean it isn't a Proof.

which is why the example of ""[the problem of Evil.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Logical_problem_of_evil)"" is so potent.

It's much easier to disprove the christian God with this logic. Because the christian god is de-facto: All powerful. All Knowing. and All-good. This All powerful. All Knowing. All Good. God has bestowed people with the knowledge of What is Good, and what is Evil, and all other things. This All Powerful, All knowing, All good, God. Wants All People, to Be good. This All powerful, All knowing, All good god, also wants only good people to be by his side in his kingdom.

But this all Powerful, All Knowing, All good god. Created a complete fuck up of everything.

At every stage this description is debunked.

In my head I prefer to think of space time in a more 3D example. Consider  4x4 foot space. There is no up. There is no down. Every inch or so is a rubbery string going from 1 side of the 4 x4 space to the other(floor to ceiling, wall to wall, and the other wall to wall) creating a big grid. Each of these bands are also connected where they intersect so every band pulls on every other band. Now however you want to pull those bands.

If you were to pull the bands at the centre close together all the bands radiating outwards go close together too. The closest bands are more affected than the outer bands.  That is mass and it’s affect on space-time(gravity) fill in more and more open space with more and more bands. And you see how space is comprised.  Pockets of thicker closer together bands. In a way. Objects travelling along these bands get curved inwards as the bands move inward towards heavy masses."

A lot of times Games with Numbers (Halo 2,3,4 etc) and lofty long-told stories are a turn off to new players. And with Halo's History of being Multi-game series, well good luck selling your product.

But to closer address your point. Fans not knowing what is going on is part of the reason we need concise organisation. And proper linear stories that address Halo as a whole, and don't retouch, re-do, or re-imagine, aspects of the universe to fit more things in. Introducing new elements in Halo needs to be done slower, and with more care."

E.G. Making Spartan II augmentations reversible, Allowing Spartans to retire (in most capacities), and bringing Failed augments back to life. Thus diluting, and removing any level of seriousness or sadness from the spartan II Project that was building from the consequences of the program. Making Spartan III's so un-unique over time. And Spartan IV's were not a well executed idea. (Removing hardship from making super soldiers not only makes Spartan II and III sacrifices seem insignificant, especially in the current story climate, but begins raising questions on how effective and efficient humanity will become in the Halo series, and why we aren't better at doing what we do somehow. etc.).

I feel Halo has a problem, but not with how much media it pumps out, it's how it chooses to create that media. They constantly try to redefine Halo. And it isn't working well. Each new idea in the Halo franchise has effectively destroyed something we loved about the old stuff. And even when we get good new Ideas, they destroy something we love about the old stuff AND THEN DESTROY THE NEW IDEA TOO 

Examples but not limited to:

* The Didact (Where is he? Why isn't he the main bad guy? He had so much story and background and potential to be a compelling villain fighting with his past and his present)
* Black team (Why? Just why?)
* Del Rio (Would have been a great antagonist to explore and work around throughout the series)
* Blue team (Building them up properly, giving them better dialogue, making them more similar to each other appearance wise)
* Jul M'dama (Seriously 343? All that Spartan OPs, Kilo 5 trilogy, for Halo 5's opening mission death?)
* Roland (He's barely been around, and should be a more vocal and present AI)
* Composer (Could have been a great threat/use like the Halo's)
* Halo 4 (Build a brand new world of possibilities then put a pillow over its face and its plot points until they stop moving)

Edit: I keep editing because more keeps coming to mind.

* TV Show: With the cast, and names revealed. and a few mentioned story beats; It's more of the same nonsense. Introducing new characters, for no reason and new plot points that crap all over the old ones, For no reason."

I'm famously a fence sitter, but I feel it gives me a unique POV to tackle issues a little more fair.

&nbsp;

**Atheism as a whole**

The issue with the structure you presented (to me) Is that Atheism, as a definition certainly does only mean 1 thing. But people do not Define or consider Atheism based on its definition, they define it based on a group with set stipulations to Qualify. This is why, to many, it's an ""ism"".

Essentially, people try to lump Atheism in with movements or groups with set doctrines. E.G. Feminism, and or Religious practices. When Atheism itself is neither of these.

This presents unique issues that ""Atheists"" can't actually tackle well because we are technically NOT a group. We are NOT united by a Philosophy or specific set of values, we do NOT have Have rules or stipulations that create denominations or Movements that unite under the banner of ""Atheism"". We are essentially the motliest crew possible. So when people try to define ""Atheism"" The easiest and most accurate answer to default to is: The definition.

And as you have raised, this definition doesn't define an Atheist, it defines ATHEISM.

**The Atheist**

The Atheist, like anyone else, is defined by their upbringing, their trials and tribulations, and the world they're born into.

Our Moral Code comes from personal experience, empathy (or lack there of), understanding (or lack there of), intelligence (or lack there of). Which means it varies.

Our Life choices also stem from the same criteria as above. Which mean they vary.

So when someone tries to calculate ""what is an atheist"" they can't. Because you can't quantify another persons value without experiencing who they are. And even then, that's difficult.

So as the Atheist, when someone asks about what an atheist is, or questions why you are one. Anything more than the definition doesn't fit well. Because it isn't Anything more than that. Anything more than that is the person describing themselves.

Atheism does not equal the Atheist.

**Back to the question**

So has the definition been waved around too often? 

* Yes

because the definition doesn't adequately describe people. and we should avoid describing ourselves or people we know in such a way.

* No

Because Atheism is simple. And if people are really confused about it, they shouldn't be. If they're looking to understand an Atheist, perhaps they should just try to get to know someone who is. They'll find we aren't that much different. Except we believe in fewer gods."

So please bare that in mind with my attempt.

The crux of the issue you are having is the choice between two options:

Creator (regardless of what kind) or None.

But to me, that isn't the most basic question at all. Because frankly what changes about your life or anyone else's if one is true or the other?

We still have to wake each day, and make choices. Whether our choices are driven by Determinism, or free will. They are still there, and present, and actively real (within the realms of what we can determine as ""real"") The consequences of said choices are still there, and there is absolutely nothing we can do to change this set up.

That being said, why is it so important that somehow something or someone ""made it so"". In the end we are who we are because we have come to be. And Therefore we should strive to look at things how they are. And strive to improve what is based on how things are as well. 

Maybe this isn't satisfactory to some, but it brings a lot of comfort to me personally knowing that this train-wreck of a planet, of a life, of a circumstance. Isn't someones plan, let alone a perfect one. If it is an accident, whether by someone, something, or coincidence, evolution etc., in the end meaning is only what I can make it based on what is present. Wow, I'm a bit intoxicated but I hope that makes sense.

tl:dr

Is the question of of a creator or not really that important in the face of current reality? We should look at existence as it is, and what evidence supports it. Making our lives better and others lives better is a matter of Doing, not what was done."

It's frustratingly similar, and in no way are you actually hampered by not Being a spartan.

Lore wise though. ODST's are very very weak compared to Spartans. (Master chief is a Spartan so I'm not going to count his as separate from his comrades)

* The ODST's do Get better armour and tools than the standard marine. 

* They are also fiercer and more level headed (Or in the eyes of Marines, crazy for the risks they take at the expense of their own well-being)

* They have Access to modified weaponry (Via request or by mission requirements) Silencers and stealth equipment as an example.

However they are still Normal Humans (outside of Stim-pack use)

Spartans, to name a few advantages Spartans have over humans.

* Greatly enhanced Physical strength and density

* Greatly enhanced and re-networked nervous system.

* Nigh unbreakable bones

* Enhanced Vision

* Better chemical balance in the brain and greater effective use of certain brain chemistry (Adrenaline rushes and Endorphins are far more potent in Spartans for example so Spartans get a powerful natural combat high)

* Mjolnir Power Armour (Enhances current abilities to even greater heights)
