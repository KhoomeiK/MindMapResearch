I’ve used weed which I find is brilliant to help you sleep but I found it near impossible to get up for work the next day, even having smoked for years.

Tried diazepam and other benzos which work a treat but have high potential for addiction so wouldn’t recommend.

Used opiates which same as above.

The best I’ve found is meditation/reading a book or something relaxing and Melatonin which is the chemical you brain uses to regulate sleep.

If you’re set on using an illicit substance I’d recommend growing your own weed over synths. If you haven’t tried them DONT. Each time you use it’s a gamble on your life.

Your friend sounds great and she sounds like what my gf was like to me.

In my local town there was essentially a Valium epidemic, my mate had brought a couple couple thousand and was distributing them. After a week to 10 days the were all sold except for 100. One night I was staying at this mates house and were dropping them. Over the course of the week weâ€™d built up a ridiculous tolerance and were dropping up to 15 pills at once (tested 10mg diazepam). So that night we were finishing up the lot. We got dug into the bag and after about 20-25 pills each my mate passed out this left me alone with a bag of roughly 60 blues. My memory of that night is very hazy but I remember waking up to an empty bag. I searched everywhere for them but they were nowhere to be found.
