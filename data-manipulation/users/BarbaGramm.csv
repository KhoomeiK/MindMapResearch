todayilearned,fedkx9w,t1_fedj01q,1579014081.0,"What?! I looked a few years back and couldn't find it. I thought I just made it up. I remember it being a moment where it seemed like there were suddenly consequences for the cartoon violence in the world of the Flintstones, which of course means rewriting your impression on the rest of the show. Heavy shit for a 5 year old."
todayilearned,fedhx7y,t1_fedc1hk,1579011966.0,"I seem to also recall them changing the way they drew Barney's eyes at the same time and that leaving young me fairly unsettled. Maybe this is a false memory, but I remember an episode where Barney crashed into a pile of bones and his eyes were different afterwards. Lol"
Marvel,fe5mk7v,t1_fe5dxbz,1578871429.0,"Weird surely can, and very often does mean horror. How would you describe Lovecraft?"
IBEW,fe4k231,t1_fdny122,1578860179.0,Lol! You outside brothers/sisters have mastered the art of the lunch break. Inside people should get lessons from you all!
IBEW,fe4ijis,t3_enjolw,1578859679.0,"If you can get accepted, join. Nobody was born knowing any of this stuff. Every journeyman you ever meet was a greenhorn once, and they had to humbly learn just like you will. 

Your most important attributes right now relate to character. 

Humility

A sense of common good

Respect

Patience

Work ethic

Honesty 

Integrity


Either you should have them or deliberately and consciously develop them. The degree to which you embrace good character will have a big impact on your level of craftsmanship (in my view, another facet of character)."
Marvel,fe39mqx,t3_ennyvi,1578847221.0,"I was hoping for a tone on par with Sinister. Dr. Strange vs. Ba'Gul kind of thing. It's Disney, so that's never going to happen. 

You can have profound tonal differences between stories and still maintain continuity with other characters in universe. Logan is more tonally consistent with Wolverine's character than anything that came before it. Deadpool the same. Dr. Strange deserves to be told in the Weird genre (Chthulu, etc.)--which is in the horror family--to get it right."
megalophobia,fcrij52,t1_fcr8oao,1577902272.0,"Yeah, that moment when his right foot got ever-so-slightly hung up on the rung as he went into his hand stand, and it seemed like we might witness a true instance of the human body subconsciously betraying itself in a precarious situation at an alarming height and just quit working under the pressure, collapsing and falling like a macabre plinko game down the tower? 


Hated it every time I've watched it."
megalophobia,fcok578,t3_ei9uh5,1577834259.0,I hated every single second of this. Upvote
science,fc5yofn,t1_fc5wm3k,1577468593.0,"Thank you very much for this! Here is another one:

[History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 1: From Colonial Times to the Founding of the American Federation of Labor] (https://www.amazon.com/dp/0717803767/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_rhKbEbQGDQQJ4)

It's a great series in the vein of Howard Zinn, but it's scope is limited due to its having been completed mid 20th century. Still a great read and informative about not only the labor movement, but also the relationship between labor and American history."
