JustNoTruth,ffddgi9,t1_ffcmoo8,1579818565.0,"One of my brothers once told a gf that he was a fighter pilot. Not only did he not know how to fly a plane, he's never even been in the military."
JUSTNOMIL,ffdd4fj,t1_ffdahva,1579818355.0,I know what movie you're talking about. With Sean Connery and a young Scarlet Johanssen.
JUSTNOMIL,ffd5cvp,t1_ffcp9fx,1579813734.0,a friend of mine works for a major jewelry company and he said flat out that young people (aka millennials and gen-z'ers) don't buy expensive jewelry like previous generations. The reason? Simply because they can't afford it and don't see the value in owning it. So MIL can claim she's sitting on a literal goldmine of fancy jewelry all she likes. It's worth nothing on the resale market.
JUSTNOMIL,ffd3gmk,t1_ffd1uby,1579812675.0,THANK YOU! I was thinking the same thing.
JUSTNOFAMILY,ffcpi84,t1_ffcklb2,1579804457.0,"you keep saying that she isn't evil but you just said that she went to his house while he was in the hospital and went through his things until she found his bank statements all in an effort to find out how much money he has. and that she wants you to transfer all his money and not tell him! that is evil! she wants to steal her own father's money that's supposed to be used to take care of him. At this point, there's no telling what she will do."
JustNoTruth,ffcg6vh,t1_ffcer52,1579798766.0,Nope. MIL called in her reinforcements and claimed OP attacked her and threatened to kill the baby. And everyone took MIL's side while the husband just stood there and let it all happen.
JustNoTruth,ffc1mji,t1_ffawhdf,1579789250.0,It's still there. I just read it.
aww,ffc15mv,t3_esr5jx,1579788897.0,I'm literally dying right now. I want one!
bulletjournal,ff7vtvf,t1_ff7l6ov,1579659563.0,That’s a little bigger than A5. My leuchtturm is 39 by 27 dots. So if you want to make one in your journal it’s 25 dots down and 25 dots across. Corner spaces are 4 dots down and 4 across. The regular spaces are 4 dots down and 3 dots across. This is according to the one I did in my own bullet journal.
bulletjournal,ff6hyun,t1_ff61cms,1579627597.0,what size? I have an A5 Leuchtturm
bulletjournal,ff615hd,t1_ff5yfyo,1579616471.0,It's actually not hard. Give me a second and I'll count out the spaces in my own Save O Poly I did. What journal do you use?
bulletjournal,ff612uy,t1_ff5sdx1,1579616416.0,hello fellow RVA person
JustNoTruth,ff4i77k,t3_erh5aw,1579564217.0,Unpopular opinion here but I’m not cool with the MIL taking the kids out of state without permission. That is a bit much.
JUSTNOFAMILY,feznmqn,t1_feywaog,1579459388.0,Not everyone with bpd acts the same. Just like not everyone who is bipolar acts the same.
depression,fettfre,t3_eqelf5,1579379867.0,"I'm so sorry that happened to you. Depending on where you live, you could still make a report to the police."
rva,fetsmh7,t3_eqg55m,1579379583.0,LOL
JUSTNOFAMILY,feslypk,t3_eqbhgw,1579366632.0,"First of all, you call the police for the theft of your car! You cannot legally sell a car that's not yours!"
JustNoTruth,fenrxm7,t3_eptjg5,1579289912.0,Yeah I found the video. This one is legit. MIL is a maniac.
rva,fek7ito,t1_fek0klg,1579194233.0,asking the real questions! I'm wondering that myself.
JUSTNOFAMILY,feigo7k,t3_ep4kr0,1579138102.0,Be firm with your sister and make a point that these stepsisters hate you and you don't trust that they won't do something to ruin your shower.
JUSTNOFAMILY,feigg65,t3_ep79ez,1579137952.0,"Your sister sounds like she has borderline personality disorder. As for the cat thing, that pisses me off that she did that. I'm so sorry you're dealing with that psycho."
raisedbynarcissists,fedudeh,t3_eodqfd,1579020085.0,"First things first: cut that cell phone service off and tell your sister since she has so much extra money now, she can start paying for her own phone."
raisedbynarcissists,fecf36q,t1_fe9zfzh,1578972400.0,"a nice little restraining order will stop her as well as a judgement against her for these types of suits. I don't know where you are, but check to see if your state (if you're in the US) has a vexatious litigant list and report her ass."
RantsFromRetail,fdoby5v,t3_em4oqc,1578602403.0,"This sounds similar to Starbucks and their unwritten rule of ""Just Say Yes"". That too is dumb as hell and defeats the purpose of having policies."
JustNoTruth,fdnazyn,t3_em2e6y,1578581871.0,"Ugh, they're always jumping the gun with accusing people of MIL-apologizing. Your comment was fair and kind."
blackladies,fdlxuqy,t1_fdlr7bk,1578535089.0,There's also the claim by people that are anti-Meghan and Pro-Kate that someone in Meghan's camp started that rumor. Not sure how true that is. People do enjoy blaming her for stuff.
JUSTNOFAMILY,fdkcknl,t3_els4cc,1578501015.0,"Who is your cell phone provider? If you’re on Verizon, perhaps someone could gift you some data."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fdfofxo,t1_fdffejx,1578366401.0,I am so sorry to hear about your husband. Is there any way you can just cut your family out?
blackfishing,fdf1vdx,t3_ekzqid,1578351410.0,What the shit was that?!
JUSTNOFAMILY,fdejalg,t1_fdeaej4,1578340224.0,I'm surprised your husband didn't kill him for this! How does he feel about what your brother did?
JustNoTruth,fd3incr,t1_fd3cqje,1578158679.0,You're assuming the mods are even bothering to fact check these stories anymore.
JustNoTruth,fd3i4u7,t1_fd2lxxn,1578158511.0,"IF this story is true, then MIL clearly didn't think this whole plan through. Like, even if the child had a reaction, EVENTUALLY they would have to return to their home country. More importantly, it would come out at some point that MIL was the one that poisoned the kid with his allergen."
JustNoTruth,fd3gzmi,t1_fd2dgv8,1578158278.0,"I think the phrase ""press charges"" has become so ubiquitous that people equate going to the police station and filing a complaint/making a report as the pressing of charges. It's up to the DA to pursue charges or not and there's times when that just doesn't happen because they don't see it as a winnable case or worthy or their time."
JustNoTruth,fd3gcuq,t3_ejw8hs,1578158083.0,"I feel like an asshole for saying this, but I'm having a hard time believing this one. Have I become so jaded by all the fakes on that sub that even something like this (that can and DOES happen) makes my bullshit meter go off?"
insanepeoplefacebook,fczptfn,t1_fcz5msk,1578106471.0,It’s called projection. LOL
JustNoTruth,fczpnx5,t1_fczb6rt,1578106384.0,"According to her posts OP has been saying no ad infinitum for some time now. It escalated at one point to her aunt trying to slap her when she refused and her grandmother took the aunt’s side. If this story is true, man, I’d be cutting grandma out of my life entirely."
JustNoTruth,fczabd8,t1_fcz9mfn,1578096875.0,Now do you see where this whole thing is crazy and why grandpa lost his shit on grandma? She’s being completely unreasonable.
weddingshaming,fcz9857,t1_fcxuvqt,1578096225.0,when brides say this I want to scream. Nobody told you to go over the top and spend the equivalent of a yearly salary on a one day party. I had a nice big wedding but I never once guilted people or made anyone feel like it was there responsibility to fund it. My husband and I were grateful that people even showed and cheered us on.
JustNoTruth,fcyqe4f,t1_fcy51xb,1578084943.0,"I understand where you're getting at, but again, let's pretend these stories are true: grandma is a huge enabler of the JustNo cousin and aunt and won't stop with her demands of OP. Even though she knows the grandfather and the rest of the family also want her, the cousin, and aunt to stop their crap, they keep doing it. First they demanded OP give up her ring she inherited from her paternal grandparents then it was her entire wedding she's paying for. Now, they're demanding a joint wedding where OP foots most of the bill even though her cousin has zero chance of getting her boyfriend back after her lies and crazy behavior. If you had a family member enabling someone like this grandmother, wouldn't you have to do something drastic to snap them out of it?"
JustNoTruth,fcypscr,t3_ejgt42,1578084606.0,What I gathered from OP (who has the worst spelling and grammar so it's kinda hard to follow her stories) is that grandfather is cutting grandma off from their money because grandma was trying to bribe OP into sharing her wedding with her entitled cousin. Never mind the fact that the cousin's boyfriend broke up with her when she tried to pass off her unborn kid as his despite the fact that he is infertile. IF these stories are true then I feel like the grandfather is probably at the end of his rope with trying to make his wife stop her behavior with enabling the cousin and aunt.
IDontWorkHereLady,fcxxqku,t3_ejd105,1578071981.0,I so wish you had gotten the police involved. These people don't learn until they have some sort of consequences. Getting banned from Walmart ain't enough.
ChoosingBeggars,fcxqr90,t1_fcxqiun,1578069199.0,"Oh, I agree. My mom and her non-crazy military wives she was friends with would always say to the other women ""you are not your husband's rank!"""
JUSTNOMIL,fcxqj5f,t3_ejdise,1578069060.0,"I have to iron my husband's clothes for him some times because he's completely incapable of doing it himself. I don't know how he keeps doing it but he tends to burn his clothes. He's actually put the iron down on top of a piece of clothing then walked away. Mind you, he has adult ADD but in order to keep him from burning the damn house down, I do the ironing if there's any that need to be done."
ChoosingBeggars,fcxoo96,t1_fcxm38s,1578067896.0,"also, there's this idea in American culture that military spouses are so brave for sacrificing so much while they're significant other is deployed. That really got reinforced in the Bush Jr. years when we had so many people deployed to the middle east. So these women have this inflated sense of self that they're ""noble"" for marrying a military man and somehow better than civilian wives."
ChoosingBeggars,fcxo12t,t1_fcxi0pv,1578067483.0,MLMs prey on military wives because they're more likely to be SAHMs thus they are bored and have plenty of time of their hands.
ChoosingBeggars,fcxng1p,t1_fcxelzx,1578067106.0,"OMG yes! I also grew up next to a military base and our area was littered with women like this. Military wives of lowly army guys are the worst in terms of self-importance. As an army brat myself, I spent a lot of time on military bases growing up and hated coming across these women when we were shopping in the commissary or PX on base. Never forget the bitch trying to cut in front of my mom claiming her husband was an officer and someone that knew her jumped in and went ""your husband is an E-2! Get over yourself!"" My dad outranked her husband by a nautical mile."
JustNoTruth,fculapn,t1_fcnhf5c,1577983501.0,"late to the party but I come from a family where rug sweeping is practically a profession for some people. I can fully believe people would be this dense and in the FOG to be like ""NOOOO! DON'T GET MIL IN TROUBLE!"""
bulletjournal,fcufew6,t3_eivghf,1577979647.0,I've been toying with the idea of doing a recipe of the month in my bullet journal. Yours looks really nice
aww,fcp96n2,t3_eicb9r,1577854742.0,Congratulations and your dog is so cute!
JUSTNOFAMILY,fclpclg,t3_ehpj8c,1577753210.0,You are so NTA in this situation. There's something seriously wrong with your SIL to have baby rabies to the extent that she just keeps having them but loses interest once they grow beyond the baby stage. I wouldn't let her back in your house and explain your fears to your SO and stepMIL and stepSIL. They seem to understand.
insanepeoplefacebook,fc7odh1,t3_egfncb,1577514247.0,I’m sure in a decade she’s going to be crying about why she wasn’t invited to her daughter’s wedding and how she’s not involved in her grandkids’ lives. Psycho bitch.
JustNoTruth,fc61mjt,t3_egc1dm,1577470228.0,"ok seriously? this OP is a bitch. An ungrateful bitch. If it weren't for her parents and sister, her kids wouldn't have had a Christmas this year and she's celebrating that her daughter hated one of the gifts because it gave her JustYesMom CBF? Yeah, toxic toxic TOXIC!"
JustNoTruth,fbtdocs,t3_edq6q4,1577075471.0,I commented on that one. She never answered me back. I call bullshit.
