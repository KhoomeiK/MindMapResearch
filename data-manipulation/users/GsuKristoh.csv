yaoi,fc7iu27,t1_fc5ogfl,1577508784.0,"Your dick would be OK. But your chest would hurt afterwards. This is because of the poor weight distribution that would happen because of the design of that ""amaca"" (At least that's how we call it in Spanish), and because of the average duration of sex, it would overall be kindof painful for the Top to endure that position.

 And if the strings aren't strong enough, the damn thing might break and the Top could actually have some damage done to his dick.

Although, this might be doable if you use an actually well done Amaca and just break a hole in it.
