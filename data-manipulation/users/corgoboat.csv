Yeah I really enjoyed the workout, but our class was completely full and it was sooo chaotic."
AskReddit,ffglytp,t1_ffgisjs,1579909317.0,"Omg mines the opposite. If it’s just the two of us and my husband is away, he’ll sleep in until almost noon if I do. Like I won’t set an alarm thinking he’ll have to go out and wake me, but no, he’s a camel and is content to wait for me"

AmItheAsshole,ffgglzv,t1_ffge5x5,1579905777.0,"I honestly think either she’s subconsciously protecting herself from remembering, or in talking about an incident from between the two inpatient stays with my therapist recently, she said it’s not uncommon for a depressed person to have a hard time remembering things like this. So it reasons that op’s mom might not be 100% aware of how much of an impact she’s having on op and siblings, like how it’s been a long time that she’s been like this. It’s just not fair to    completely vilify the mom because she’s sick and it’s making it so she can’t process a situation like a normally functioning person (ie - I have three living kids who need me to parent them, I should get up and do that)"
