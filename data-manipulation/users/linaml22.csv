UBC,ffbou8a,t1_ffbkd54,1579776260.0,So strange! At least it seems like there are no credit card issues for other people besides me
UBC,ffbotdc,t1_ffb7p8k,1579776225.0,They haven’t replied yet! But to be fair I sent them the message around the same time I made this post so it hasn’t been too long!
UBC,ffb4xb3,t1_ffb4plu,1579751894.0,"Good to know! Probably just an issue with my own bank account then if everyone is saying theirs is fine, so thank you! This is reassuring :)"
UBC,ffb4w03,t1_ffb4idj,1579751867.0,Thanks for letting me know! hahha
UBC,ffb4v70,t1_ffb4rte,1579751850.0,okay sweet! thanks!
UBC,ffb49os,t1_ffb40kh,1579751400.0,ugh so weird! can you log onto your bank account/do you see new charges?
UBC,ffb493r,t1_ffb45hg,1579751388.0,that's even weirder! did you actually get charged anything on your bank account?? really hoping its some email glitch and not some website data info issue
UBC,ffb36jy,t3_esnj46,1579750617.0,"I messaged The Calendar on Facebook, but wanted to know if this was happening to other people- and if you could lot into your credit card accounts, and see if something had been charged or not?? I'm just scared my account has somehow been compromised or someone got the full info from The Calendar website. It's possible there's just issues with my own credit card account (website issues, maybe put in the wrong password a few times/forgot a capital in security question... I'm gonna go to the bank tomorrow) , so that's why I'm asking if anyone else is experiencing the same thing."
UBC,fe6ognk,t1_fe3r2vh,1578898150.0,Ahh love to hear that!! I probably will!
UBC,fe6og05,t1_fe02wdv,1578898128.0,I did yes! I’ve been doing it since high school! I majored in psych and minored in commerce :)
UBC,fe6ntxa,t3_eo03xv,1578897423.0,"Hi! I’m planning to take it at the end of the month and got some information from the department about it! I can definitely send you the screenshots of the emails :) DM me! I’ll try to reply soonish, but I’m not on Reddit as constantly as I am on other social media apps"
UBC,fdyfsq0,t1_fdtt7oz,1578779334.0,"A little bit of panicking hahaha. I actually do film/TV acting outside of school so I want to give myself some time to pursue it full time since it’s always been a bit hectic with school, and if it doesn’t pan out I’ll probably apply to some marketing jobs :)"
UBC,fdyfnmm,t1_fdtzdlf,1578779275.0,"Bye Ben! Being in your classes was one of my most memorable learning experiences at UBC, it’s profs like you that help make the university so special :) so thank you!"
UBC,fdtndxk,t1_fdt692m,1578719283.0,"Totally, I've been having conflicting feelings all week! It's been even weirder because even though I'm done my degree, I don't graduate until May, so these next 4 months feel like a strange limbo stage. I'll definitely miss the campus, it's seriously so pretty. 

And thank you so much!"
forestapp,fdshd3n,t1_fdsh8gd,1578702775.0,"I'm using ios, weird! this just recently started happening for me with the new update"
UBC,fdse0v7,t1_fdrxd65,1578700524.0,same! I love these! pretty expensive but honestly have been so worth it and will definitely last!
UBC,fdsdwod,t3_emzge4,1578700443.0,"excuse me while I go have a small identity crisis because being a student is basically all I've ever known, and the real world is??? a bit scary??? at least I still gotta wait to officially graduate in May"
forestapp,fdsd3hb,t1_fdr26xq,1578699884.0,"I literally just set the thing to be 1.5 hours and it does it automatically! 1 hour gives me 2 trees, 1.5 gives me 3, and so on!"
forestapp,fdsd1ht,t1_fdq6s20,1578699846.0,"really?? I used to plant for 1.5 hours sessions all the time and only got 1 tree at a time, unless I did 3 30 minute sessions"
acting,fdpy5c9,t1_fdhmac7,1578645547.0,"I did the whole headshots, resume, video clip and submitted to a bunch of agencies and then did the interview thing"
acting,fdpy4er,t1_fdevr76,1578645514.0,"I’m actually a student, and I’ll skip class whenever I’ve got an audition. Can be kinda painful but obviously more flexible than a job would be. Before I decided to go full time with academics/acting, I worked at a restaurant though and made sure to get the late shifts so it would be less likely that I’d miss an audition"
UBC,fdp4k2z,t3_em5z6m,1578619837.0,"Don’t have a studyblr but recently started bullet journaling and I love it so much! Before I just used my agenda, but now I kinda combined the two and it’s a great system. Love the Muji pens, the Muji tape glue thing, Zebra Mildliners and although they’re expensive the Tombow dual brush pens are really great for pretty calligraphy"
bulletjournal,fdp41mo,t3_emcgzh,1578619495.0,"This literally looks like a tumblr/Pinterest photo, it’s sooo cute!! Nice!!"
acting,fdg8aps,t1_fde98kw,1578384256.0,"I do yes! But definitely wasn’t going to share that publicly hahaha. I totally agree with you about it being motivating. I hadn’t thought of doing what you said, I’ll consider including it for this year!"
acting,fdg8993,t1_fdetl6r,1578384203.0,"Unfortunately I have no idea, sorry about that :/"
acting,fdg88q7,t1_fddcp12,1578384184.0,"Mhmm I can’t really say anything about which is better to get started in because I don’t really know the LA scene. I do think there’s a bit less competition in Vancouver (even then it’s quite a bit), and there’s plenty of drama shows up here but not a lot of comedy if that matters to you. Besides that I’m not really sure what else to say. 

Funny coincidence, but nope not Julian. Good for him though, that’s a great booking!"
acting,fdg84bw,t1_fdete0f,1578384024.0,That’s right thanks for replying to them :)
acting,fdg8419,t1_fddi94t,1578384014.0,100% have been through my agent!
acting,fdg83eh,t1_fddw64u,1578383992.0,"Yay! Also great to note down all auditions and casting directors, tone, role type, etc. To see other patterns (not shown in the picture, but also super helpful if you’re planning on doing something like this)"
acting,fdg8213,t1_fddwacl,1578383943.0,Totally agree! When I started I heard “50 auditions to 1 booking” is pretty normal and I didn’t believe it till I actually was in it.
acting,fdg816s,t1_fde0aru,1578383913.0,"Hahahaha maybe! Not quite the goal though, but not opposed to it :)"
acting,fdg80b8,t1_fdcrm37,1578383882.0,"Ah that sooo cool! You guys are also so extremely driven and creative, I love love having conversations with aspiring directors/writers and hearing their perspective on the industry. Good luck to you!"
acting,fdg7ykf,t1_fde7quc,1578383820.0,"Congrats! That’s good to hear! 

And I totally agree. Also even if they don’t cut the role, sometimes I find they casted someone sooooo so different from me that fits significantly better in the part, and then it kind of makes sense that I wasn’t cast. It’s reassuring to know sometimes things are genuinely out of our control, and sometimes maybe they just decided a different ethnicity was more fitting with the cast, or a different look, or totally different “essence”."
acting,fdg7vfq,t1_fder3li,1578383707.0,"Honestly I’ve only seen improvements since I started doing this, that is more auditions and more bookings as time goes by, so I’m not really sure. I don’t think I’d obsess over it though, maybe just an extra push to do better?"
acting,fdg7tyx,t1_fdet83n,1578383655.0,100% of them were through my agent!
acting,fddafxa,t1_fdcy0im,1578302491.0,It’s really reassuring that I’m not the only one who thinks this way. Thank you
acting,fddadwi,t1_fdcth4i,1578302408.0,"Exactly! I think I summed other things up in my other reply, but I just think it’s the numbers game is crazy. People expect you to be booking like crazy but statistically speaking it’s very difficult."
acting,fddacrz,t1_fdcs03r,1578302361.0,"It’s actually been one of my luckiest years. The typical ratio is 50 auditions to 1 booking for most actors. It sounds crazy, but it’s just the way it is. The people that “make it” have that 1 booking be a big film or big TV show. The statistics of the industry are honestly astounding if you really look into it. 
Even just making it to the casting room is insane. 3,000 submissions, and only 80 people will go in to the audition room (I suggest listening to a podcast with David Rappaport that casts all the CW stuff and he talks about the numbers game)"
acting,fdda935,t1_fdd5qra,1578302210.0,About 2.5 years! So I’ve got a Year in Review from 2018 but not one from 2017
acting,fdda75w,t1_fdd0si2,1578302130.0,"I’m actually in Vancouver, Canada! It’s been pretty busy in terms of production up here because of the incentives for US companies to shoot up here. Soooo much stuff shoots up here, it’s crazy. There’s tons of Australians here for acting actually! There’s like 30% in my acting classes. One of them came here about 2 years ago and booked a Netflix show 1 year in!"
acting,fdda5se,t1_fdczhdt,1578302074.0,Thank youu!! It’s been such a great year and I really feel a bit more confident going into this new year. It’s great doing this every year because then I can compare to how things have previously been :)
acting,fdda408,t1_fdcwr6f,1578302001.0,"Every single audition I get is through my agent. Typically agents will submit on Casting Workbook, Casting Network, and Actors Access. But if you’re starting out you can definitely look into some student films to build demo to submit to agencies :)"
acting,fdda2az,t1_fdcvgpz,1578301931.0,That’s really great! I tried doing it on my computer for one year and I think I’m more of a notebook and pen kinda girl when it comes to this! Love that that works for you - I love the searchability aspect of it
acting,fdda167,t1_fdcwdyk,1578301883.0,I’m in Vancouver! And honestly for all of 2019 I was just a student and my only other income consisted on social media earnings (lol I know).
acting,fdda041,t1_fdd66zt,1578301840.0,Thank you! I’m with you on that one.
acting,fdcq9v2,t3_eko2r3,1578281341.0,"It’s super helpful in seeing what casting directors consistently bring you back, what kind of roles you’re going in for, what you’re getting callbacks for, the ratio of auditions to callbacks, etc. etc. 

I scratched out my bookings cuz they haven’t aired yet!"
youtubers,fd8ixye,t1_fd89igf,1578218962.0,She’s got a pretty wild personality that I guess just stuck with people. But I think the algorithm also blessed her haha cuz I think she reached 1 million subs in just a few months
youtubers,fd899gu,t3_ek99hh,1578215410.0,"Totally. Joanna Ceddia filmed on her iPhone for months, I think she reached 1 million subscribers and everything was filmed on like an iPhone 7 I think"
bulletjournal,fcywt9c,t1_fcysygn,1578088808.0,"woah thats interesting. I hadn't heard of the one you mentioned, I'll have to look into it for sure, cuz the one I have is 80gsm, I had no idea this was a thing when I bought it"
bulletjournal,fcywraq,t1_fcxp8xo,1578088774.0,I looked into them but I don't like the covers! Thanks though!
bulletjournal,fcywqai,t1_fcx6lsl,1578088757.0,how long did shipping take??? I find Ali Express is eternal in getting my things to me

bulletjournal,fcywmlf,t1_fcx19xw,1578088692.0,"I think its 80gsm, so not too great. But I heard so much about Leuchtrum and it had the same gsm that I figured mine would be fine... should've done more research. Thanks for the link!"
bulletjournal,fcywkku,t1_fcx0kll,1578088657.0,thanks for the suggestion!! I was on their website and unfortunately they only have bright colours right now or the ones with doodles on the cover which I don't particularly like
