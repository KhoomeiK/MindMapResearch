I think he was probably looking for a quick crack fix or something, he was looking to grab anything he could sell for a quick buck. A few weeks later, my moped was stolen from our yard/inside our gate. Someone had to have picked it up out of our yard, lifted it over the gate and mounted it into a van. I did file that with the police and they told me that people often stole mopeds and took them over to the Caribbean to resell."

AskReddit,fcfjssi,t3_eh6lfb,1577630650.0,"My alcoholic father drunkenly told me the night before I left to study abroad for a year in college that he took a life insurance policy out on me. When I asked why, he snidely remarked, “at least if you die we’ll get rich”. At the time I was devastated and heartbroken, but it has taken many years of therapy and life experience to understand that my father is and was a deeply wounded man. It does not excuse emotional abuse, but it certainly has helped me contextualize his behavior. He has a tendency to say horrible things when he is drunk, and I now know it’s because he is extremely sad and has zero self esteem. He never apologized to me. He never acknowledged it at all. He was drunk so I was supposed to forget it, that was always the case growing up in our home. I have forgiven him, but I will never forget it. Words cannot be taken back, words can scar."

offmychest,fcc2n1t,t3_eh1g9p,1577593718.0,"I am so sorry. I understand your struggle. My father is an emotionally abusive alcoholic and I have been afraid for my safety on more than one occasion. You have to set boundaries. If you are old enough to not live in the house, you have the ability to limit your time with him. That is what saved me. If you have younger siblings who are still there, please confide in someone you trust who can help you address this concern in a safe and controlled environment where your father will be held accountable and cannot fly off the handle.  I feel for you. Whatever you do, don’t hurt yourself - think of your Siblings and the people you love when you feel weak. Do not give your father that much power."

NoStupidQuestions,fcaq5ne,t1_fcap9lf,1577574374.0,"That’s not the question you asked. You asked why they feel this way and I answered you. Your argument that you cannot generalize a group of people is a separate issue. I agree with you on that, but  the truth is their perception is not based on just a “few Americans” who represent the US poorly, it’s the many people who travel abroad and act like jerks, and it’s the way we are portrayed in the media abroad. I think the most illuminating thing for me when I lived abroad was seeing our country through another country’s eyes through their media coverage. It’s not a nice picture that is painted.  We are just as influenced by our news in the US, right or wrong. You can take the last election as an example of that.  The US has done horrible things throughout history to justify a dislike and distrust of our country and the people in it. We are known for being entitled and aggressive. And not all ”aggression” is bad, for example, aggressively putting yourself out in the world to make your dreams come true can be a wonderful thing. That is the idea behind the American spirit, so it’s not a black or white issue.   From my experience, the same people who preach in the US that “if you come to America you should learn English”, will be the same people who will have an attitude with a waiter in Italy because how could he possibly not speak English!? The hypocrisy can be astounding.   There’s a lot of wonderful things about this country, but you asked a question and I answered you. There are reasons they have this image of us and they are complex and run deep."
NoStupidQuestions,fcap1ew,t3_egxm4g,1577573707.0,"Go abroad and watch how 99.8% of Americans act (drunk, loud, entitled) and you will understand.  You can spot them from a mile away.

AskReddit,fc9vj5h,t3_egubpl,1577558829.0,"I have been there and it’s really tough. It’s hard to see anyone you love die, but especially when someone seemingly goes long before their time. Everyone copes with grief differently, but the key, I believe, is to sit with the pain and to experience it without resistance. And that is really hard in this world that conditions us daily to deny death. I personally believe the only way through is in.  It’s an intense and shitty pain, but it passes, and the more you learn to sit with uncomfortable and intense emotions, the more you begin to see their capacity to evaporate. Much of our inability to “cope” and grieve as a macro is our outright denial of death in this culture and the demonization of aging. The truth is we are all dying, every day. In my mind, the way I have honored the many people I have loved who I have lost is to continue to think about them, to cry when the tears arise and to welcome them with love. I still talk about my friends who are no longer with me in the flesh - I still think of them and light a candle every year at the anniversary of their passing. Keeping their memory alive in my heart and being present to all the emotions that come with that acknowledgment has helped me more than anything.  There is a tradition in Judaism called “sitting shiva” when, after the death of a loved one, all the mirrors are covered in the home of the ones left behind and they are left to grieve for seven days. It’s a time of no distractions, a time intended to grieve and to sit with the pain and not stuff it away.  I am not Jewish but that tradition has inspired me to implement my own interpretation of that ritual. I think it’s beautiful and deeply reverent. If you are asking this question because you have lost someone close to you, I send you my deepest condolences."
AskReddit,fc9saqu,t3_egu0kk,1577557466.0,"I think what happens is similar to what sometimes happens with children: people convince themselves  that getting married, having a child, moving away, or insert-any-other-big-life-transition-here, will somehow “fix” a relationship. I imagine that both parties are aware of the problems, but one is hoping a big gesture will somehow distract from the issues and set them straight and essentially “fix” it.   You can run from your problems, but you can’t hide. Anyone who has known someone to marry or have children in this type of situation will tell you that it’s not a good idea, ever. It will not end well. Saying “yes” to a marriage proposal should feel like one of the clearest and most delightful moment in one’s life. I have a lot of respect for someone who has the courage to decline a marriage proposal, despite the theatrics and ability to be swept away by the moment. Marriage, and especially starting a family, is a huge decision with everlasting and profound ramifications.  I admire someone who understands the gravity of that question and decision."

But now that have had a child of my own and being a photographer of kids, I have learned that kids (esp the little ones) will show you the entire range of human emotion (laughter, tears, mania, excitement, etc) within about 40 minutes, regardless of the circumstances - because kids are emotional little beings who still are trying to make sense of all their feelings, and that’s what makes them awesome - they are authentic. As long as the camera is rollin, I imagine they can get whatever emotion they need."

This is one of many moments in your life  when you will have to look within to determine your direction. There isn’t a right or wrong, instead there’s the option to either make this choice with your heart and soul in alignment, or to make this decision from a fearful and disconnected frame of mind."
