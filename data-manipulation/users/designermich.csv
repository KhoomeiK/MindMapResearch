fatlogic,fgjtoys,t1_fgjmm8m,1580851197.0,"I wasn’t trying to be snarky, just genuinely was unsure. I always thought I was average but I get told I’m “tiny” all the time, and I realized I guess am thinner than average—which is still weird for me and I still don’t totally believe it. This is interesting and good context for conversations about weight vs. appearance vs. health."
fatlogic,fgjde5y,t1_fgjcoca,1580841698.0,That’s so interesting. We talk about weight solely in numbers so often we don’t usually consider that distribution can actually make a significant difference in appearance.
fatlogic,fgjch5s,t1_fgin9ec,1580841153.0,Is this sarcasm? I’m 5’8” and ~138 and am very thin (US size s/2). I’m just super curious and interested about how such similar measurements can appear differently.
fatlogic,fcl0add,t3_ehoffh,1577737020.0,How about this? “You do not have to feel guilty for dieting around those who are not.”
