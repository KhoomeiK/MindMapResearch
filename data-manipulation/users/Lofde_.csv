pics,ffdt3j5,t1_ffds94m,1579828244.0,Took me a min to realize what was going on I had to zoom in on the bottom picture to see the miniature cars. Was wondering how this got so many up votes before that.
politics,ffdjx8q,t1_ffdjkvd,1579822453.0,Yeah classic
politics,ffdbzqo,t1_ffd97sq,1579817641.0,Good point.
politics,ffdbytm,t1_ffd8xyz,1579817625.0,"Yeah, it would def be epic though they'd probably be facing charges.. It would still be an amazing prank."
politics,ffdbvnn,t1_ffd8kvm,1579817567.0,Thank you! It would make me laugh too.. I could just see his cheeks going bright red with furry! Haha. There was another post about his throat growing big like a frog to show dominance against other senators it was hilarious. Then there's the youtube video about Mitch being a dick from dickipedia which is pretty good as well.
politics,ffd74nf,t1_ffd6suv,1579814720.0,Not sure to be honest. I always saw the video being called 'Russian'.
politics,ffd67ni,t1_ffcttgn,1579814209.0,"I wish we could troll them in the senate trail like they did in Russia, I would pay good money to see someone with a [drone fly a dildo right into the mouth of Mitch McConnell](https://youtu.be/zbnDr_IbdIU)"
AskReddit,ffb8zpl,t1_ffat72z,1579755573.0,"I can see how it would have been an issue with Blockbuster HQ buying all these movies and then sending them out to a location and then those being all returned to one local store, like trying to keep up with that inventory of what ""should be going back to HQ"". Then again I'm not really sure how blockbusters worked with franchises and such. The thing about it though a DVD or Bluray is just a piece of plastic, its so inexpensive, still cant compete with digital delivery though esp with fiber going out everywhere."
MarioKartTour,ffb25i0,t1_ffa9c6e,1579749898.0,">21.99 €

thats $24.38 USD but it only cost us $19.99"
MarioKartTour,ffb1cay,t1_ff9s4yn,1579749346.0,"im at tier 27 for the second week in a row trying to finish this one myself.. what makes me mad is im at player level 60 and i only update my badge with the new level. so i still am stuck with a badge showing 40, and whats worse i bet ive done 1500 bananas and first place 700 times etc but it wont show it when i get the new card ill have to start from scratch.. bet ill be at player level 99 by then."
MarioKartTour,ff93rh7,t1_ff8oq78,1579704131.0,Ahh gotcha makes sense now that you say that.
MarioKartTour,ff85mdc,t1_ff77ef8,1579666642.0,"I'm gonna be staying on tier 27 not moving bc I'm in 8th place, my lugi I'm 10.9k, 9.5k, and 12.3k currently"
MarioKartTour,ff8430s,t1_ff834yf,1579665447.0,Amen to that. Can't wait for 12 to hit and it all be over I've already been grinding on lugi
MarioKartTour,ff82z54,t3_es5yrz,1579664615.0,I hate the item boxes in the shells that disappear when a bot hits them. So fucked up
MarioKartTour,ff82x33,t1_ff7jhbt,1579664572.0,"Getting 19k on cheep is insane, like I only have 12k. Some black fucking magic"
MarioKartTour,ff816oe,t1_ff7ksz5,1579663299.0,"Came here to say this, def go right and then the shortcut on the left.

Anyone know what that shortcut is in the cave that goes left though? It looks like you should be able to go that way but can't. On the ditty one you could go right and do a jump which was pretty cool but only using manual, or having a boost bc it wouldn't steer that way in normal mode."
MarioKartTour,ff80t4r,t1_ff7zjcd,1579663028.0,I'm in first place with all my 30 friends I made from reddit but I'm 8th in my tier 27... My girlfriends phone I played hers and got her up to 3rd place in tier 22.. These races just suck I hate cheep cheep and I can't get frenzy on the other two bc I don't have a good driver.. I've already started focusing on lugi cup bc of this
WTF,ff7ovo2,t1_ff7ku7p,1579654757.0,She was willing.
MarioKartTour,ff6i5js,t1_ff5q25b,1579627712.0,"Three different devices, ios, android, and switch. Different cpus gpus etc but a lot of code should be sharable between them. Sadly the phones don't have good input devices besides the touch screen."
Tennessee,ff6hxee,t1_ff5nysd,1579627572.0,Yert
MarioKartTour,ff6hwmv,t1_ff5nfoh,1579627559.0,"Gotcha I joined after tiers were a thing
At first I didn't know it was a cup race and kept wondering why my tier wasn't going up with me completing more full races"
MarioKartTour,ff6hsmw,t1_ff5mrgg,1579627491.0,"Oh that's right I can't finish 2-4 bc I'm stuck in tier 27 can't get 30. Makes me mad cuz I know I'd already would have completed a ton of those racing challenges, I'm aleady player level 60, they need a 2-6"
MarioKartTour,ff5hnrq,t1_ff5hepy,1579593313.0,"Yeah Nintendo has so much code, resources etc I don't see why they don't have a lot more poured into this, developing for the switch can't be that different than programming for Android or ios devices."
MarioKartTour,ff5hgni,t1_ff4fzk9,1579593055.0,Which one gives you the tier 50 badge??
MarioKartTour,ff5hesk,t1_ff55xtl,1579592985.0,I'm on reddit is fun so it looks weird
MarioKartTour,ff5ha0d,t1_ff5fxqr,1579592818.0,"It wasn't that bad before as far as lag, it just wasnt that fun before. Several reasons.. The races picked themselves. If you got in first you didn't win or lose anything. It's like you were just racing to be doing it. Eventually you're like 'this is worse than playing bots'. Another thing that got to me is everyone that has the player for the track picks the best so you basically end up with 7 metal Mario's with the same car and one person unique. Etc."
MarioKartTour,ff5gayv,t1_ff5af8s,1579591599.0,I can't do manual drift. I drift like crazy using the new button that was added but when in manual I slide around like a drunk trying to drive his car home on an icy road.
MarioKartTour,ff5g6id,t1_ff5fx53,1579591447.0,Yeah I'd love to hord some of them but I use them right away to level up a person for the tier races. I don't see how people save them.
MarioKartTour,ff5g2rv,t1_ff5eb10,1579591319.0,"Gold pass is seriously best bang for your buck, but I wouldn't spend anymore money than that on the game. I have gold pass and I like it because at the end of each tour I'm getting a high end skill point for driver cart and gilder that's the most valuable item. Finally got one driver (high end) and one gilder (super) to 6, almost got one car(?) to 6"
politics,ff5fyep,t1_ff5d0fp,1579591171.0,Gotcha I remembered something about it. Mitch pissed me off the way he held up Obamas court nomination. I hate that fucker.
MarioKartTour,ff5fwc7,t1_ff5bvd3,1579591101.0,"Damn. That's kind of sad in a way. Maybe with the new multi player test coming out soon they'll add some features to that. Because on a way the tier is just a way of measuring 'multiplayer skill but without actual good drivers' it's going to be interesting putting your 'skills to test against real human gameplay.' me and my girlfriend played it for a few races before they took it off and it def needed some polishing, but it also didn't have a goal. No rubies to earn, no coins to bet on a race etc."
MarioKartTour,ff5frur,t1_ff5bv2l,1579590945.0,"No I'm not there yet, I'm just wondering ""what's next"". Like trying to get all the players up to level 6?... Trying to get to tier 50? Eventually you've raced bots, leveled up.. Etc.. It just feels like it might be time to buy a switch and get Mario kart 8 deluxe or something.."
todayilearned,ff5btf0,t1_ff5bbuw,1579586543.0,Sometimes I get lucky and wipe and nothing on the paper. I still follow it up with two more 'check wipes' but typically it's a 7-8 wipe affair. I just def want as much fecal matter as possible removed. If you don't you'll itch later.
AskReddit,ff5bidj,t1_ff3ennl,1579586231.0,"Except it's only 802.11b and you only avg about 1mbps. So you can do things like IRC and reddit, but downloading pictures takes a bit, and video doesn't work well above 360p"
todayilearned,ff5b1qu,t1_ff59uwn,1579585771.0,"We live like kings in America compared to the way Indians lived.. We're so sheltered. Like I just wiped my butt with the free roll of toilet paper from the hotel, I have no idea how to make it, where it came from and its value is so low here but to the kid who is starving, in 'x country here' stuck outside taking a poop with no TP, I sip a drink in honor of you kid. Sorry you can't read this, but I'm thinking of you."
