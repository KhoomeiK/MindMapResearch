They are deep shades of blue and sometimes stormy gray with four wings; the webbing fading from a light blue to a rich purple. They can breathe a fairly powerful bolt of lightning which can stun their enemies briefly. They enjoy flying and usually spend time wherever storms will occur. 
Queen: Queen Strike
Usual temperament: StormWings are almost always very intimidating and commanding dragons. They act tough and strict. StormWings are a no-nonsense dragon tribe.
