So I've taken the MBTI before and have gotten the INTJ result as far back as 20 years ago, but the best thing we ever got was a little sheet that gave broad basics until I looked into more very recently and all these weirdly specific details about me from professional to personal lined up with the type, so I'm pretty new at this.

This will probably be difficult since you already know what an INTJ is, but you can only try your best. I was fortunate to take the test before I knew any of this.

If you match it, then look into the INTJ stuff (or whatever you test as) on Youtube or just google search and find it weirdly specific and accurate and then read other MBTI personalities and they don't really fit or fit nearly as well with INTJs then that's a good start. You can also examine other INTJs here and see if there personalities and problems are very similar to yours without being broad, but pretty specific. 

I took the test forever ago, but for some reason didn't really look into it further until recently when some of the details were just way too in depth to be coincidental and became intrigued at that point. 

It's not a perfect test. There is a (worthy) debate going on in this sub about artistry and creativity,  I'm wiling to bet not everything is completely in isolation, but I'd say its definitely by far the best method of categorizing personality I've encountered thus far."

I only started paying attention to the MBTI as of late and it can't be coincidence. The themes specifically seem to fit with alot of INTJ stuff since the Joker aka Chaos is his Equal but Opposite if that makes any sense. 

Daredevil is probably my favorite complete show (Complete meaning all seasons are great and don't go off the deep-end like GoT and Westworld) and knowing he's also an INTJ also may be why I liked it so much. It's a well received show, but I seemed to like it even more having no real affinity for Daredevil beforehand.  Pilot episode was one of my favorites of all time and season 1 was pretty amazing. I cannot suggest this highly enough."

I would say that the fact the prisoner/convicted person gets a memory wipe after each ""experience"" (I think?, it's been awhile) is counter-intuitive. To extend suffering would be more of a function of time. Perhaps changing the entire Method where the memory is not wiped, but the individual retains memories and has to eventually redo the scenario until the correct/desired path of events to a wanted outcome in an effort to rehabilitate would be a much better use of resources. 

It may be a good deterrent to avoid poeple breaking laws initially if they know that they'll be wasting their lives redoing this weird experiment, but the actual experience is very heavy on resources if it becomes a more regular method of punishment."

To no surprise, I was very much the same. Trust your instincts, they are correct. I 'm so thankful, I listened to myself instead of giving in like I wanted to so many times to fit in.

Nootropics,fcwzg8t,t3_ej95bi,1578044343.0,"Just like u/gribzydib 's experience, my depression became chronic from food allergies and I’m sure it’s actually probably the case for the majority of people. Did a test that reported I had zero probiotic in my small intestine (and I’ve never openly felt gastro problems). This of course means leaky gut and food allergies/intolerances. Wheat/Dairy/Sugar are the very typical allergies, so pretty confident to cut those out immediately in the meantime if you want to do an allergy test for others.  Celiac test is a good specific one in addition to a general test. 

Unlike the current Reddit circlejerk that is constantly posting on the TIL subreddit for a quick Karma grab, Celiac and wheat allergy isn't exactly a dichotomous thing. I was very close to the minimal Celiac value meaning that I wasn't full Celiac, but had a very high autoimmune response to wheat/gluten. 

As for curbing inflammation…instead of CBD, my Functional Medicine doc gave me something called InflaMed that has is an assortment of different anti-inflammatory properties), but I've had just about everything all have mentioned and for value purposes, I actually just stuck with Turmeric/Circumin. 

I get my general inflammation tested every two months and have for about 5 years and I can say with complete confidence that exercise (however much you can manage) and secondly cutting down the previously mentioned foods is by far the best anti-inflammatory and it’s not even close. Most supplements I focus on are ones that are able to enhance my exercise/energy capacity than inflammation itself.

Supreme Stress B Vitamin and Cal/Mag/Zinc are the go-to depressive supplements that more than one doctor has gone to immediately and for good reason since I can definitely tell after a few days when I don't take them compared to others. They have helped me the most so far for short-term energy while I heal for long-term.

Trying to play Devil's Advocate as best I can but she could possibly not have the assertiveness to know how shady this looks. I agree with you and empathize completely on this ""betrayal"" feeling entirely with the details you provided. It appears very shady and suspect on the surface even if it's intended to be harmless.

If she just booked it without even talking to you with that ratio of guys to her especially not knowing them too awfully long, I'd personally be extremely pissed. I'd even start be concerned for her safety if shes known them for only 3 months but I'm paranoid like that although my paranoia based on my experience is completely warranted. I'm going to reasonably assume alcohol will be involved and all sense of rationalism can be destroyed when too much alcohol is consumed so trusting her is not 100 percent relevant which is a pretty basic response to something like this. Shes also outnumbered when it comes to peer pressure.

I would personally find this a pretty big issue if you two are pretty serious. Despite her reasoning, this in my opinion is still a red flag (albeit maybe not a large one) regardless of intent that it was not even mentioned before booking. If you're intentions going forward are going to be serious, you both need to start making decisions together especially something like this.

It depends entirely by her response and be prepared to respond to any possible contingencies and reasonings rationally and have a plan to act on what avenue of reasoning she pursues. I'll leave the rest for you to decide instead of giving my opinions since you know your past history with her better than anyone.
