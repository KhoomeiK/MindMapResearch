One of the Catholic values (because it is the religion I know the most) is solidarity, as promoted in the social doctrine of the Catholic Church published in the encyclical ""Rerum Novarum"" of Pope Leon XIII in 1891, which encouraged actions such as those of Mother Teresa (Nobel Peace Prize in 1979), of Abbé Pierre (Resistant & creator of an association to help the poorly housed), & the creation of various humanitarian actions. So there is merit.

>Case in point: the Bible, written when it was socially permissible to  own slaves, says it’s alright to beat slaves as long as they don’t die  as an immediate result of their injuries within a two-day timeframe (Ex  21:20-21).

In the verse you quoted, from which I have taken a version where slavery was legal in its time (Ostervald translation), it is written: ""If anyone has struck his or her servant with a stick, and he or she has died at his or her hand, he or she shall not fail to be punished. But if he survives a day or two, they will not punish him; for it is his money. ""

You're right, but in the same chapter is defended the right of women & of the human being in general. Moreover, in the Gospel according to Matthew, in chapters 5, 6 & 7, appears the sermon of the mountain, which will create in modern times Christian socialism, & which is based on the idea of equality between men (equality of souls), fraternity between men (all brothers as ""sons of God"") and human dignity (men are made ""in the image of God""). This at the same time (but not the same testament).

&#x200B;

>However, you don’t see many Christians these days talking about how it’s okay to own slaves, let alone beat them.

Yes, because religion grown with modernity. That why the Martin Luther thesis was made.

What are the lies? This can be obvious, but my answer depand examples.

> So if you want to make the argument that religion is a good thing  because it makes people feel more fulfilled, then the question becomes,  is it a good thing to give someone false hope by lying to them? 

If it's not dangerous, yes, because everything have good, & religions can teach how to react.

Edit: Quote syntaxis & more argument."
unpopularopinion,fe0lz5m,t1_fe047pc,1578815827.0,">Factual merits? Yeah that’s right, they have none

Actually, religion gave faith, a meaning of life, morality, values, & can help people on identital crisis like Kanye West (in the right Church/Mosque/Synagogue). Note that I think that Evangelic Church don't complete all the criteria.
