Other people have had no issues it might just be something irregular.  I saw you mentioned in the thread abour accuracy. It's not as pin prick test because it's not subcutaneous, and the prick is direct.  They like to say it's 3-5 minutes behind. 

It's worth doing the free trial if you're offered it.  It's one of those things that work for some but not everyone and you might  fall in that some."
