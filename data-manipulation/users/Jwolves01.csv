anime,ffhr6uc,t3_etotbu,1579949601.0,the opening is AWESOME. AS ALWAYS KANA BOON's songs are. The ending is great too. Looks like the rest of the season will be more lighthearted. Let's hope Shouto and Kacchan pass the exam.
anime,ffg4t69,t3_etfd1y,1579898469.0,It's great to see Hinata develop and get other skills. This episode was very funny. Especially when he got hit in balls. I hope Yamaguchi succeeds in getting better at serving
anime,ffg1lxj,t3_etewsh,1579896491.0,Tsumura and drama are the only reasons I'm still watching this. Though Chiyuki wasn't as annoying in this episode as she was in the previous 2.

anime,fffqd7l,t3_etd8cj,1579889518.0,This was a great episode. I really liked the fight. So seems like the Florist needs money for his daughter to take care of herself once he dies. So tears incoming.

anime,ffdc4aj,t3_eszgyg,1579817722.0,The first few mins of this episode were boring due to it being the everybody forgot about a character cliche. But after that the episode became hilarious again and I laughed. Hanako and Minamoto were badass. Misaki seems really interesting and she has a sad backstory. I love Megumi Ogata's voice.

anime,ff00gx4,t3_eqzws4,1579463844.0,This episode was really great! My favorite so far of this series. The old man's story made me cry and it was great to see continuity. And of course HO-OH appearing was amazing!
anime,feyx0l4,t3_eqxb6d,1579451535.0,I really liked this episode. the mystery was very intriguing. And the soundtrack was amazing especially that Samurai song. So Narihisago is a serial killer killer. I hope nothing happens to Hondomachi. This show is getting better with every episode. My rating will rise to 8 if it continues being this good.
PoliticalCompassMemes,fettso7,t3_eqh5jk,1579379992.0,For once I agree with AuthRight
anime,fervzyl,t3_eqgpfs,1579358951.0,LMAO this episode was so hilarious! I love all 3 of the main trio. I hope the other 2 are gonna show up soon. RIP Seri. He ended up yelling at his crush.

anime,fepotyg,t1_fep19xs,1579326403.0,Yeah. thats true.
anime,feofw28,t1_feo74bu,1579299589.0,I don't mean the models in clothing. I meant the changing scenes.
anime,feo2zy4,t1_feo0bsi,1579294451.0,Thats true. This isn't the worst case of fanservice. Many really great anime have it worser. Yea at least this one made sense.
anime,feo2qp4,t3_eq54t9,1579294304.0,Another great episode. I feel bad for hinata. The way he stuck his head was hilarious.
anime,fenxf9r,t3_eq4xm9,1579292216.0,I'm glad Ikuto is the actual protagonist. He's a way better character than Chiyuki. This episode handled most of the gripes I had with the last episode well. It was very realistic and also showed the harsh side of fashion industry. I'm interested to see how Ikuto will grow. my rating of this show would've risen into 7 if it wasn't for that stupid fanservice. I hope there won't be too much of it.
anime,fenjwpw,t3_eq2xtz,1579286281.0,This episode was cool. It was awesome to see badass Shuka fight by herself. The florist seems like an interesting villain. Kaname got really badass at the end. He and the Analyst work well together. I hope that this show won't turn into a harem. It was also interesting to see some of the people behind D-game.

anime,fekp18s,t3_epkc7l,1579204637.0,I really liked how this episode dared to show the issues with systematic bigotty in Japanese society. And how even good people like Seigi have it unconsciously. The Gem in this episode was interesting. I guess I'll watch all the episodes of this anime and won't drop it.
anime,fekllmb,t3_epmzys,1579202592.0,This episode was hilarious..Though I still find Hanako kind of creepy. Minamoto suddenly attackking was unexpected. The darker moments were awesome. Hanako being a murderer was suprising. I'm very hyped for the next episode.
anime,fekiby9,t3_epm2e6,1579200643.0,Another amazing episode. The fantasy world is gorgeous. and this episode was cute and funny. With hint of the later darker stuff at the end.
