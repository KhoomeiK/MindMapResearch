Crunchyroll,ffo9ws1,t1_ffnxla4,1580075519.0,"I didn't say that the brakes don't work, I said that they're essential... The core, most important part of Crunchyroll is the streaming service it provides, the queue is very minor, the login system is also not very important, as long as it works you're fine. You guys are worse than us Brits... We complain a lot but you're complaining over something so retarded and unimportant it can't even be called a first world problem"
Crunchyroll,ffnx0l4,t1_ffnuy6i,1580071835.0,"That example is nothing like what I'm saying. Brakes are an essential part of a car. If you're gonna be a spaz, and relate this to a car, I'm saying you have a cracked side window, you're car works fine, there's just a minor inconvenience if you look to your left"
Crunchyroll,ffnu8h3,t1_ffnthzj,1580070896.0,"I'm only referring to the streaming part when I say seamless. Who gives a fuck about the retarded queue system. This is one of the worst examples of entitled consumerism I've ever come across... I pay for Crunchyroll, just like you do, I accept the product for what it is. If you don't like it... Don't pay for it. The people over at Crunchyroll can do whatever the fuck they like with their product."
Crunchyroll,ffnr9da,t1_ffnqxdu,1580069692.0,"Oh damn, I've never had that happen. If you had a lot in your queue, that's rough"
Crunchyroll,ffnr52e,t1_ffnpu3d,1580069642.0,Everyone on this subreddit it fucking retarded... I said WATCHING THE ANIME IS SEAMLESS... Finding the anime you want to watch might be more difficult than previously but YOUR VIEWING EXPERIENCE IS NOT AFFECTED
Crunchyroll,ffnppkg,t1_ffm949m,1580069062.0,"They might not have actually been removed. Ever since I got crunchyroll, I've added things to my queue but they don't show up on the actual queue page but when I go onto the anime page, it says it's in my queue. It's always been a little bit buggy"
Crunchyroll,ffnpcnp,t1_ffne521,1580068916.0,"I have no idea how to make it more obvious what I fucking mean. Most of the time you spend on Crunchyroll is WATCHING anime, WATCHING, not looking for anime, WATCHING. This can be done SEAMLESSLY. I didn't say that the new queue system is good, it's not, but neither is the old one. I have specified multiple times that the watching of anime is seamless which is the most important part of crunchyroll"
Crunchyroll,ffmzi2o,t1_ffmz498,1580060472.0,"Again, as I literally said, you can WATCH anime seamlessly, watch, watch, watch. Did you get that? No? WATCH."
Crunchyroll,ffmxuc0,t1_ffmxa76,1580060028.0,"As I literally said in my comment, finding the anime that you want to watch might be difficult to get used to. You can still WATCH the anime with no issues"
Crunchyroll,ffmudgo,t3_eu0vma,1580059024.0,"Crunchyroll's queue has always been unrealiable, at least for me but it's very illogical to get this angry over something that doesn't affect the main thing crunchyroll is used for... Watching anime. You can still watch anime seamlessly, getting to the anime you want to watch might be a little bit difficult to get used to but you can still watch anime with very few issues."
screaming,ffd2iv5,t1_ffcwy9a,1579812139.0,"I've been trying to scream for around six months. When I say trying I mean just singing along in my car. When I do it, it hurts a bit but I do think that it's more of a discomfort. When this happens though, my throat starts to get very phlegmy, so I have to clear it quite often for a few hours."
spotify,fed01wh,t1_febjp9w,1578991923.0,Yes they take data but they can't take personal data from a music streaming service... It's fucking music
Metalcore,fe9npi6,t1_fe96bgw,1578939825.0,"I'm not being closed minded, I've listened to plenty of acoustic pieces of music and it's just not for me, I don't like it.
I just gave you my opinion on the song plus an upvote... Take the karma and stfu"
spotify,fe816j8,t1_fe80xzc,1578921231.0,They don't really do that anyway. They look at little things but no personal information so why do you care?
Metalcore,fe70t3y,t1_fe6pay1,1578908470.0,I'm personally not into acoustic
spotify,fe6pv29,t3_entis9,1578899845.0,"When things give you the option to sign in with facebook or google, just use that. Facebook and google are very secure and it also saves the you the hassle of remembering loads of passwords (if you don't use the same for each website)"
Metalcore,fe6pa8z,t3_enumfc,1578899133.0,Had an iffy start with the acoustic stuff but after about a minute it gets so good!

Metalcore,fdh4u2p,t3_el0f1l,1578415404.0,I have the You Are We CD and listen to it in my car... Never realised Oli Sykes was in this song xD
SuicideWatch,fdekxxz,t1_fdejtp6,1578341222.0,Glad it helped you out man. Feel free to dm me if you want to talk to anyone <3
SuicideWatch,fdeigkp,t3_ekyhol,1578339720.0,"That is terrible, who thinks to send the police when they hear that someone is feeling suicidal. Also, why would the police arrest someone and give them time for feeling suicidal... That is absolutely awful"

SuicideWatch,fdegvj0,t3_ekyrhj,1578338748.0,"I personally believe that there is no afterlife at all, I think it is something made up by humans for comfort which I don't really understand, I don't feel like death is an uncomforting thought. In my opinion, when you die, there is nothing. No pain, no feelings, no thoughts, nothing.

If you ever feel like you need to talk to someone, you can always dm me, I'm always open."
SuicideWatch,fdeg8h8,t3_ekwy6f,1578338355.0,"I know exactly what you mean, man. I made a post on this subreddit not too long ago where I explain that adulthood is just a suffer. You aren't alone my guy"
SuicideWatch,fdbmidt,t3_ekgwve,1578258802.0,"Feel free to talk to most people in this subreddit, almost everyone here is understanding and willing to help you through."
SuicideWatch,fdbkd5u,t3_ekhnkg,1578258191.0,"I know what you mean, man. One thing I've found that helps calm me and forget everything for a moment is to watch the Bob Ross streams on Twitch. It's very peaceful and distracting, this may help subside cravings for a little bit, it won't be the cure that keeps you sober but you may feel like you need it less."

screaming,fcuo3s6,t1_fcungxm,1577985111.0,You're pretty good. It would be nice to learn how to do low screams because the only tone I can do ATM is the Mid-High one in the video
nextfuckinglevel,fckg5y3,t3_ehg305,1577724593.0,How tf do you figure out this route
mildlyinteresting,fckfdcc,t3_ehlmsi,1577724086.0,"'No waste' is a little bit far, around 8L of water (or more depending on the toilet) is still used in a single flush which is massively wasteful.
The wasted water is reduced with this."

worldnews,fbjodrg,t3_edjy7h,1576937293.0,"What I hate about this is that the title specifies how many women died... 1500 people died, that's it, there's nothing more needed. The addition of '29 women confirmed dead' is very sexist"
