Deliberate food poisoning would depend on the type of poison that was used. It could be instant, hypothetically speaking. 


If it was food poisoning due to raw food and/or some sort of bacteria. It would depend on how long it took your body system to ingest the harmful substances into your bloodstream. It could take a couple of hours.

As you grow, you’re gonna be put into situations like these - where you will need to swallow pride and reach out and ask for help. It makes you vulnerable right? And nobody likes feeling that - it’s completely normal. Reach out to individuals whom you can trust. And whom have supported you in the past. 


Most of all - don’t be so difficult on yourself. Take some deep breaths. Take a hot relaxing shower. Take a walk. Listen to some music. You got this."
