Especially when the dems claimed to have sent bulletproof articles with witness testimony to the Senate, knowing how the senate was going to vote. I , for one thought the whole process was messed up the whole way through and was 100 percent a political stunt. Still, I would have liked to hear what they'd have said.

All legislators have a dormitory complex in DC. They are housed and fed and given healthcare on taxpayer dime. They have no expenses. 

All legislators will have 2 bank accounts. 1 for personal and 1 for campaign. All transactions will be transparent and on some .gov website. Any accounts found other than those result in jail. This allows people to vote put politicians taking mo ey from people they dont like.

facepalm,ffza5lh,t1_ffy8s41,1580369203.0,"Ok I'll try.


If you govern speech, one way or another, then you are giving the government the power to decide which speech is morally good an morally bad. The government is much more likely to abuse that power by crushing dissenting opinions of the majority at that point in time.

Suddenly, anyone who vocally disagrees with the government, or opinions officials have, are in jail for 10 years. Now the thought police are real.

Everyone should be allowed their stupid ass shitty opinions, but a call to action is different that an opinion. No actual threats of violence. 

Even racist rhetoric should be allowed. That is for the people to debate and discuss, not the government.

One of the most dangerous things a society can do is make the government the arbiter of morality."

People with schizophrenia dont get told ""No, the voices are actually real.""

People with gender dysphoria DO get told, ""Yes, your body doesnt match your brain.



On another note, the entire gender and transgender issue are at a complete logical conflict:

If gender really isn't social construct, then there is no reason to transition at all. If there is mo distinction between men's and women's brains, then you cant end up with a body that doesnt match that binary choice.

There is another thing, which you can see on Reddit, where those on the left side of the aisle absolutley hate anyone who supports anything Trump does. People take attacks against Trump as an attack on them, very often. This is not ignoring that the same thing happens the other way around, but any time someone comes out supporting the right, they are painted as vile, evil people, and are generally quieter about their views.

You cant just tell half the voters that they are complete morons and idiots and racist and disgusting, and expect people to be happy about it.

There are TWO people to vote for. The chances of that person representing the pinnacle of every single one of your beliefs is approximatley zero. The same goes for another person voting for another candidate. 

If trump does something, the left and the media have to hate it. Even if it's good.

It becomes a referendum on the voter, not the candidate. It goes a step further when people think an attack on a candidate is an attack on them. 

Especially presidential candidates.

Honestly. Hear this: you get TWO choices. Three of you choose not to vote, I guess. The probability of any one of those 2 people being the pinnacle representation of ecery single one of your morals, values, and beliefs  is pretty much zero, which is probably the same for the person who voted for the other candidate.

The entire Middle East is about the size of the US right? Iraq is about the size of a few states. Smaller than Texas). People their, who were 'well funded',  hid in that area and managed to keep the U.S. fighting for years.

So if we compare the size of the group the U.S. was fighting there to the army of gun owners here, along with the overall area, it's a much, much bigger  fish to fry, right?

That's not including trying to get the military to fire in their own citizens.

Best way to do it would be to have the military occupied somewhere else and have UN peacekeepers do the job in the mainland. It's not like police are going to do that to their own communities.
