assholedesign,fffja8w,t3_eta5ps,1579885168.0,"This happens several times a year. I work as a merchandiser. Once a package gets rebranded they just shave a few ounces off and no one notices. Your 16oz box of Corn Flakes is now 14.2 oz. They do it so you don’t notice.
It is despicable and I hate it. Everytime I do a reset I notice this. Bas**ds."
rangers,fffhyg0,t3_et1ysv,1579884357.0,It is a 52. I can send a picture
rangers,fffhspk,t1_ffe6lsk,1579884259.0,"Let me check it may be a 52 now that I think of it.
I get back to you in a moment."
rangers,ffdvkzo,t3_et1ysv,1579830010.0,I will ask my son he has a brand new one with tags unnamed that is too big but I believe it’s a 54 too. It was a gift that is just hanging in the closet. Be he does love Zucc. Let me know and good luck. Good for you for losing weight.
