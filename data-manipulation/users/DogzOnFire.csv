Kinda funny to see Americans reduce everything to ""communism bad"" though. As a country it seems like you've been conditioned by your government to be terrified of anything that's not loudly in favour of a free market.

Especially funny since the Chinese economy is the supposed economic ideal that many Americans seem to have. Only it's in China which they don't like because it has the nerve to be a powerful state they can't bully. Same with Russia."

In 99% of games, an NPC not being in the the current frame doesn't have any effect on whether or not they can ""see"" the PC. In DmC, they won't attack the PC when out of frame but I'm mostly certain they will still ""see"" the PC and move towards them, attacking when they're in frame.

Edit: It does remind me of another clumsy trick that happens in DS3 with dog enemies, where dogs will teleport to the player's location if the camera is panned away from them. Something to do with the engine losing track of the enemy's coordinates because they're moving around so much and then just deciding to spawn them at the camera. Most likely as a result of some type of memory management of objects not currently on screen, like what happens in occlusion culling."
