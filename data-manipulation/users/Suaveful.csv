depression,ff86js3,t3_es6nqn,1579667402.0,"hey just so you know, symptoms of depression include lack of motivation and suicidal thoughts. remember that a lot of these feelings are biological and you’ve got to treat it as the illness it is. 

i’m 27 now and especially after anthony bourdain’s suicide, i believe that this depression is going to haunt us forever. we will always be fighting our demon. but over time, you get a lot better at it. you become resilient, and you find ways to cope. it may seem hopeless, but i think that even with the sadness, we all have something to offer the world. 

i have so much advice, but honestly the best thing i can offer is to really accept how you feel. i personally treat my depression like a cold. it’s okay to stay in bed for a day or week or two. you’ve got to take care of yourself because when things are good, you’ll be able to give so much more. 

also, i recommend seeing a school counselor. they usually have resources to help students in taking care of mental health.

stay strong!!"
depression,fdyx7f9,t1_fdxlmff,1578784469.0,"i am a hopeful person. i would like to think the pain we go through is for a reason. i'd like to be a therapist one day and while there are days where i can't stand to exist, i know that there are others who could use my help.

my piece of advice? find something to do during the day. there was a point in my life where i was just volunteering around the community because i couldn't hold down a job or stay in school. volunteering made me feel some worth because i knew i was doing something meaningful. 

also, you're strong for asking for help. we heal because of those around us. keep fighting. :)"
depression,fdvz46q,t1_fdvyv9b,1578753328.0,some people walk through life while others are rollerskating. never compare; focus on yourself and life will follow :)
depression,fdvx5l9,t1_fdvwes6,1578752710.0,"the twenties seem to more work and struggle. i think our lives are going to start closer to our thirties or forties. 

we have so much life to live! just wait until you can afford all of the good things! it’s all about making time for the more important things. just take it one day at a time :)"
depression,fdvwpcw,t3_en7w5y,1578752535.0,"i haven’t dated in a while because i personally believe that i’d ruin anyone in a relationship with me. probably false but it’s an insecurity i have.

being closer to age 30 feels like i’m running out of time. but i want everything about myself taken care of before i settle. i do not want to stress about how i’ll be earning money, nor do i want to worry about managing my depression. i’d like for such issues to be solved prior to dating. when i get into a relationship, i want it to be more collaboration rather than cultivation. idk.

it’s okay to be single. especially as a male you could literally be 60 until you impregnate another woman. be the best you can be - the girlfriend will come."
depression,fdvvppr,t3_en6hc2,1578752101.0,"it’s difficult because i want to reply, “i need a partner who will care when i am sick.”

depression is an illness, and we need rest when we don’t have energy. some won’t understand that. 

therapy does help, but i also recommend communicating with your partner about the symptoms of depression. if he can’t understand it, it’s going to be difficult for him to be there for you. 

there’s nothing wrong with having depression. there’s nothing wrong with being on the couch when sick. there is nothing wrong with you."
depression,fdvv7ju,t1_fdvuby8,1578751841.0,"you arent alone. my best advice would be to reach out to a mental health professional (therapist, social worker, psychologist). they would be well equipped to help work with you and any mental illness."
depression,fdvtiou,t3_en7336,1578751282.0,"the problem with depression is that it makes you want to do nothing. it sucks the life and energy out of you.

for me, i feel kinda guilty when i’m depressed. i spent like five hours cleaning my apartment today and i was reminded of how much time i’ve wasted in order to make such a mess. i was bedridden for two months. 

i know i was sick but i can’t help but think how much life i have missed because of depression. it makes me sad sometimes but i remember that it’s an illness. 

it’s okay to give yourself time to rest, but take advantage of life. at least then, the downs don’t seem so bad when you have the ups to compare them to."
depression,fdvs0bd,t3_en795u,1578750889.0,"hi, i am 27 and am still in undergrad. 

all of my friends have started their careers while i haven’t graduated, but the same dilemma exists: what’s the point?

i know you have to make money, but what’s to say that your happiness is defined by society’s idea of success? idk. sometimes i think that it’s better to just try to get some land somewhere inexpensive and live independently away from anyone. in fact, modern agrarian societies have higher happiness and less stress than industrialized societies. it seems as if we give up our satisfaction at the cost of technological convenience.

we may be depressed but it doesn’t mean our lives have to be. what makes you happy? make your life about that. <3"
depression,fdvqnst,t3_en7b3j,1578750391.0,"i am diagnosed with both ADHD and major depressive disorder. it’s not easy but it’s been much more manageable since i’ve been formally diagnosed (a couple years ago at age 25).

i take an antidepressant (20 mg lexapro) and a stimulant (10 mg XR adderall) daily, along with weekly psychotherapy sessions and a monthly psychiatrist check. i do my best to communicate the fluctuations of my emotions to both mental health professionals so they can recommend steps to cope with my abilities. i mess up a bunch, but i am okay as long as i’m moving forward.

i wish i could lay in bed and sleep all day. but when i do, i end up doing it for months. for that not to happen i have to follow a routine, take medication, eat, and sleep properly. there are imperfect days, but if you’re giving yourself a fighting chance against your depression, you are doing great. 

stay strong!!"
depression,fdvomzf,t3_en7dvx,1578749747.0,"it’s funny how coincidental our thoughts were today. i basically asked the same thing you did; how do people just keep it together when i’m expecting myself to fall apart?

someone once told me, ‘everyone is in a place where they don’t know what they’re doing.” whether it may be true or not, i do know that we aren’t alone. 

fake it until you make it. there is beauty in life. find the awesomeness in your own. only you can discover what makes your life amazing. 

we’re here for you <3"
depression,fdob3bu,t3_emfeyp,1578601987.0,"heya just wanted to remind you that existence doesn’t have to be defined by society’s standards. there’s something you offer the world, it’s just not always clear. stay strong <3"
bipolar2,fcqxo7w,t3_ei1koz,1577893773.0,overkill by colin hay has been my go-to when i’m feeling low lately.
Tinder,f9xzbwu,t1_f9xxvik,1575720869.0,"i was like, “backstreet boys were active in 99...but that’s kind of a stretch right?” i had to look up the fact they meant brooklyn nine-nine, which came out in 2013 -.-"
