AskMen,ffw4f7i,t3_evay0q,1580283865.0,"As a girl who did this because of deep seated trust issues and insecurity, I say don't let her do this. 

First and foremost, it breaks down the core of a relationship: communication. When she bypasses you to go through your phone, she is NOT communicating her insecurities and emotions to you. She is also denying you the opportunity to communicate some ease to her emotions and paranoia. Coincidentally, I had other communication issues and ""teamwork"" issues. It's not a very constructive relationship if someone is always harboring negative feelings and playing a lone wolf on getting to the bottom of it. 

Secondly, because there's a communication breakdown, there is no environment to foster trust. She will get into your phone, she will see things from her (already negatively warped) perspective, and the ensuing argument is something you can't win because she ""saw the evidence."" Maybe you can explain it away, but she will always have that nagging doubt. 

Thirdly, this opens the door for other controlling behavior. The more she goes into your phone, she starts with just messages. Next time it's being logged into your social media and examining the profiles of people you interact with, maybe even pretending to be you in a conversation with them to get more information, or secretly blocking people she doesn't like you seeing. Maybe she starts to go through your banking apps, trying to see where you spend your money and if there's anything amiss there... pictures... locations that might be saved... How much of your life is on your phone, and how much can one person use against you? If it sounds like crazy girl behavior, it's not. It's abusive behavior, and ""crazy girls"" can just as likely know exactly what theyre doing by accessing your phone and twisting arguments to make themselves entitled to more access. This is the exact thing that abused women have to fear every day. You just never know how far this can go. 

Nip this in the bud and emphasize FAIR communication in your relationship. Everybody's phone is a PERSONAL item with PERSONAL information nowadays. NO ONE should be crossing those lines without consent. Sometimes the problem is too deep rooted and she needs counseling: there is no shame in that. Whatever needs to happen to keep that dysfunction out of your life."

bipolar,ffu8g5q,t3_ev2f2u,1580236682.0,"Are you on any other meds? I was on 300 mg with no issues but drowsiness, so they prescribed wellbutrin for me to take in the morning. THATS when i started having nightmares."
BipolarReddit,ffu7t02,t3_ev2lcn,1580236298.0,"My main trigger for self harm is stress. You mention youre really busy but super stressed. Maybe yourr not coping well with having a full schedule? Do you feel chronically disorganized? Have you been having trouble keeping up on chores or keeping up on self care (drinking water, healthy eating, exercise)? Have you had time to yourself to relax?

I was just in this same schedule for the past month. The paragraph above described me to a T. Ive only been able to get a handle on it today. 

It could also be hypomania exacerbating the thoughts. Racing mind, increased productivity/workload and overwhelming happiness can be innocent, but they can also be telltale signs of an episode. I would err on the side of caution and schedule an appointment with your doctor and your therapist asap. One to make sure youre on the right meds to stabilize your mood (if you havent been taking them, then take them!!!), the other to help you sort through your self harm thoughts and where they might be coming from.

Im glad you reached out! I dont like to self harm anymore either and my intrusive thoughts are annoying but i also use them as a sign that i havent been taking good care of myself."

BipolarReddit,ffk3zid,t3_eu0nnc,1580015110.0,"That nervous energy almost sounds like overstimulation? But its not?

Im having trouble following your thoughts but i understand the energy youre talking about. 

You mentioned getting nervous over a missed opportunity (the bus, if i read that right). Do you think it might be a regret sort of deal? Like being nervous that you didnt make the right decision? Or maybe that youre not using your time well?

It makes sense that music put you in a better place. I used to just sit under the blankets and put in headphones and lay on my back listening to music for hours just zoning out and day dreaming. Very peaceful experience for me as well. 

Sorry, i took my drowsy-making meds. I might not be making much sense either. Its like, i think get a good sense of what youre talking about and i can empathize but its hard for me to put my own experience into words.

BipolarReddit,ff3jni3,t3_erfotp,1579542467.0,"Yeah, some side effects are more ""common"" because theyre more mild, and sometimes you dont notice them or they just dont happen for months and months. 

The bruising from my depakote was a thing i didnt really connect for like a year. Im a very clumsy person, but i also usually remember where i get my bruises from? I had a lot on my left knee specifically and i was like ""there must be SOMETHING that i keep banging my leg on at work that i just dont notice"" but no -- bruising is a side effect of depakote. 

Its the same with some meds not making me drowsy even though thats a side effect. 

And how people complain about seroquel making them zombies? That doesnt happen to everyone either.

I know you said it in your post, but you can ask your doctor about it. Maybe youre just easy to prescribe for. Thats okay. This doesnt invalidate you in the slightest. I also dont think ive taken as many of the same meds as you, so i dont really know the experience with any of them and if theyre really bad or not. Or maybe youre onto something and you need some further analysis into your diagnosis. 

Plus, god forbid, maybe you spoke too soon, and the next med change that happens will be awful lol.

SkincareAddiction,feitje0,t3_ep6tb6,1579146826.0,"I have to exfoliate before any sort of deep lip treatment. Moisturizing the dead skin layer will still soak in beneath it, but then the healthy skin starts letting go of the dead skin because why would it need to cling to that crap if theyre healthy now?

I exfoliate my lips every other day or two. You can wet your finger and dip it in sugar, use a lip scrub product, a tooth brush, or a wet washcloth. Ive found the washcloth to have the most effect. 

Then I will moisturize with my normal face moisturizer. I figure might as well. I use one with hyaluronic acid from peter thomas roth (is esspensive).

After that I try to use a more oily product. Burts bees shea moisture lip balm (has a silver cap) is pretty good. It kind of doubles as an occlusive as well as soaking into the lips over time. Sometimes i will cover my lips in this before i exfoliate just so they dont feel ravaged during the whole thing.

Lip masks are optional, i personally dont use them. Maybe i would have better results if i did, and i would use them between exfoliating and moisturizing. But like i said, ive never used them and ive never seen the directions for them. 

I have been dealing with this for basically my entire life. Exfoliating is always the key step. Nothing changes without getting that dead skin off."
BipolarReddit,fefrvvo,t3_eooxon,1579063378.0,"I have the easiest time waking up when I practice sleep hygiene and get a GOOD night’s sleep. 

Like, I put down the phone. Chill in bed with a book. Take my pills. Go to bed at a reasonable time. Really takes out my dread and anxiety for the day because I know I’m prepared as soon as I wake up, just because I set myself up well. I also try not to drink caffeine in the afternoons either anymore. 

I know this isn’t an immediate help, but this is the only way that got me results. I have the same problems with getting out of bed because I’m just too exhausted to deal with the day, but I went to bed at 9 last night and got up for 4 for my opening shift with so much ease. I felt like an entirely different person. Usually I go to bed at like 11-12 and I die as soon as I wake up. To me, it’s the ultimate self care."
BipolarReddit,fdqyq3p,t3_emfk9h,1578676925.0,"No, this is an episode. Youre ticking all of the boxes for hypomania. Im sure the drug use isnt helping.

Try to get your doctor on the phone and ask what you can do with your meds in the meantime. Mine will usually recommend extra depakote and klonopin to try to keep myself calm until i can go in for an official med change.

And yes, drugs ""lose efficacy"" over time because we become more tolerant of them. You might need a dosage increase anyways."
Frugal,fdqskps,t3_emowvy,1578673975.0,"Rice, beans, corn, diced tomatoes. Mix it all up together all the time. This can be cooked in the microwave, even the rice.

Eggs are also your friend. You can eat them hard boiled. If your kettle gets hot enough i would be putting that to use. DO NOT PUT THEM IN THE MICROWAVE. They also last like an extra month past the sell by date, i promise. Where i am theyre like 69 cents a dozen.

bipolar,fdiv85q,t3_eljxdq,1578451790.0,"Keep up on therapy!!!  Fr building up coping mechanisms and identifying triggers is key in the beginning stages of your diagnosis. Your therapist will also help you navigate any hardships you face while going through treatment. A supportive therapist is your biggest asset right now.

I also recommend doing some research. Theres a book that everyone recommends that i cant remember the name of, but if you search ""books"" in this sub youll find posts about it. The first thing i would do is look up the differences between mania, hypomania, mixed episodes, and depression. Read about those symptoms so you can recognize them in yourself and deal with them appropriately.

Lastly, always read about your meds. Know the potential side effects. Pay attention to what youre putting in your body. 

Also recognize that its a lot. This is a chronic illness. Its a constant battle. You will have good days and bad days, days where youre frustrated with the whole situation and you wish you could just be normal because being SO VIGILANT all of the time is exhausting, especially in the beginning. Just keep looking at the light of the end of the tunnel. Eventually, the meds are tolerable, your therapist says ""i think we can have less frequent sessions because youve made a lot of progress,"" and you know how to work through different episodes to make it easy on yourself. It's still effort, and it always will be. You just gotta keep fighting the good fight."

Remember its your right, not your responsibility. If you can pursue charges and you dont want to, thats entirely up to you. But this is a time when you deserve to feel empowered in your search for justice. You do not deserve to feel like trash. 

But of course it makes sense to! If this were about appreciating you and respecting you, he wouldve asked permission and respected your decision before sharing. The fact that you found out the way that you did means that he wasnt doing either of those things. You were being treated like trash. However, it is HIS FAULT for treating you that way. You did absolutely nothing wrong by trusting your partner! HIS choices are what led to this. NOT yours. 

You would not be ruining his life by reporting. He ruined his own life by making awful choices. Your report is just a consequence of those actions, and if he doesnt like it then maybe he shouldve thought to do better.
