modernwarfare,ffs60xq,t1_ffs4rhb,1580174010.0,"It can be broken but it's WAY harder in HC. Go give it a try. Even holding down lay flat or anything, it doesn't matter, it's insta-death. You can't change to rpg or throw a grenade fast enough (if it's being done correctly to you). Core it's a little easier to break out of."

modernwarfare,ffs4i19,t1_ffr63gq,1580172926.0,"It hasn't existed like it is in MW in previous games. The straight containers fucked it all up. I've played every version of shipment in each game, and as far as HC Dom goes, it's NEVER been that bad getting spawn trapped. And I've been on the good end too, and it's never been that easy to trap people."
modernwarfare,ffi7k6e,t1_ffhl13p,1579967156.0,"All seasons should be at least 2 new maps and the remake, and season 4 should be a map from ghosts. Because next season I don't want just to terminal and the high-rise. I would like 3 new maps plus high-rise. That would be the way to go for me. In the old days we always got four maps in the DLC."

So quit acting like you know anything about anywhere other than the narrow little view of the world you have. I'm sorry people called you a frog, that's ridiculous, I hate hearing that someone called you a frog. But you do sound very self-righteous with an anglo chip on your shoulder.

modernwarfare,fef3mg5,t1_fedgb3o,1579047390.0,Yeah I just use an M91 with FMJ and it's done in no time. It won't even get any kills if I get on it fast enough. Which brings me great joy. But it would be nice to get assists on those times I wasn't the one to make it explode.

modernwarfare,fds0tel,t1_fdqywvz,1578692489.0,"Yes it is. There are thousands and thousands of times players (you included) have looked around a corner and someone came along right away and you killed them or no one ever came along at all and you went along with your day. But the times when you look away and someone appears right away are the ones that stick out to you and the ones getting posted.
