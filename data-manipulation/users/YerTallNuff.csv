Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffdyb7c,t1_ffdxlho,1579831954.0,See I got the female symbol just now. A white box and a female symbol.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffdwo7w,t1_ffd5uz4,1579830782.0,I learned its really just a coding issue. People putting in a different emoji that my phone doesn't have so it codes in the gender symbols instead.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffdwlgc,t1_ffd9ua0,1579830728.0,Oooooooooohhhhh that makes so mic more sense now.  Thank you.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffd9qt7,t1_ffd9ksw,1579816206.0,Huh weird. So you didn't put the female symbol in your text up there?
