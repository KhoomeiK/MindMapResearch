I’m totally new at boxing, starting tonight.

I want to know how do I know what size in oz should I order for the gloves?

Some charts tell you to look at the circumference of the hand at the knuckle level (19cm for me)

Others asks me to look at my weight (about 85kg)

Ideally if I have to pick something I wish to pick the smallest possible but hey, i have no idea what I’m doing yet!

For tonight I will rent a pair, they sell some at the place I go but I prefer shopping for myself!

Thanx in advance"
