insanepeoplefacebook,ff77fae,t3_eruqpq,1579642602.0,"What a stupidly ridiculous statement.

Years ago people got married and china was considered an investment, kind of like diamond rings, silver place settings, and fur coats.  People paid stupid amount of money for china place settings because they were pretty, light weight (compared to stonewear and glass) and carried a certain amount of prestige.  They were for special occasions, and handed down through the generations.  Then, it became a bit of a competition between china companies and new designs were introduced through new companies and patterns became obsolete much more quickly than the old companies, that had somewhat cornered the market.

Now, you can buy light weight Corelle type dinnerware that is pretty, dishwasher safe, inexpensive and easily available.  Why would you not prefer that, as it is functional and easy to replace, and dishwasher safe.

Personally, I own a beautiful set of Royal Dalton china, 8 piece place setting, tea pot, assorted bowls and bits, worth about $4,000 at cost.  I couldn't sell it for $200 so I use it for daily dinnerware.  My mom MADE me choose a pattern before my wedding, and even in 1973ish I knew it was stupid.

I'm an older person, but seriously how old are you that you can't figure this shit out and not be a jerk to new generations that don't have time for silliness like this.  Having said way too much already, if you go to a thrift store and find pretty china pieces, there is really nothing quite as nice as mismatched old skool china to eat your mac and cheese, breakfast toast or perogies on, on the daily.
