But for one thing, the hunter-gatherers are in ketogenic diet whereas Olympic athletes have a more common high carb diet. Also depending on which sport they play in their diet is different. Also high carb diets and high calorie diets lead to higher testosterone levels. So I would say that diet is very important rather than just exercise.

I also have a theory based on this. When a tribe of Hunter-gatherers would stumbled upon a high carb source, their testosterone and fat levels would rise, making them ready for mateing. Otherwise their usual diet of meat was only ment for their survival."
