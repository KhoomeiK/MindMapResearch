CBT,ffc5wkv,t3_essdt0,1579792270.0,"Meditation really helped me to separate myself from my thoughts which made it easier to identify them because I no longer accepted them as truth the second they came into my head. The hardest step I think is identifying the thoughts in the first place it's not too hard to respond rationally to them once you've gotten them written down. Try meditating even just 5 to 10 minutes a day to get some practice noticing thoughts before you accept them as part of you. It helps add a buffer between the time a thought comes into your head and when you accept it as truth, which causes it to not be so automatic and makes it easier to identify the distorted thoughts."
CBT,ff7xerc,t1_ff7tazn,1579660635.0,"I would say try to identify and try to break down your resistance before trying any method. For me personally with my anxiety, I wrote down all the good and positive things about my anxiety and what it said about me. So for example, I wrote down things like: It protects me, prepares me for the future. If I worry enough about a problem eventually I will solve it. It shows I care deeply about the things I worry about. It motivates me and makes me feel like I am moving forward because I think intensely about certain things. 

So you write all the pros down and basically what you are doing is bringing your subconscious hold on the anxiety to conscious awareness and it helps show you why you don't want to let go of that anxiety. Once you are aware of the pros you then start writing the cons. And this is where you can defeat the pros that cause you to hold on to the anxiety (or depression, addiction, perfectionism, whatever it may be). You start to rationally and one at a time respond to the pros such as with my anxiety. While it may motivate me to a certain degree, in many cases it is paralyzing and prevents me from doing things to better my life. I feel it protects me, and in some cases may be true but it also keeps me from growing stronger by facing certain fears. 

David Burns calls this the cost-benefit analysis technique. It helps you realize why you are holding on, and why it might be ok to hold on to some parts of it. Not all anxiety is bad, it can be helpful, but too much can be debilitating, and this helps get your mind to a comfortable place in letting some of that go. After doing this, then try the techniques. If one doesn't work for you then you can move on to the next one I know David Burns will have over 100 in his new book that is coming out this year. But I think if you try the techniques without true motivation to change and you have a strong resistance, then you will have little progress. But I hope this helped at least a bit! I encourage you to check out David Burns' podcast, it was a life changer for me. Best of luck to you on your journey!"

I think there are some dangers to marijuana most people don't know about which is why I wish it were legal and they could regulate it and warn people about it. For some people with anxiety, like me, it can make it even worse. And for me I had a sense of impending doom and not only did I feel like I was gonna die, I felt like I needed to die. It triggered suicide ideation and panic attacks in me for about 6 months before I recovered."

Meditation,fe0fd9e,t1_fe08uu5,1578812469.0,"In a way yes. But I wouldn't use the word fight I would say maybe either accept or revise. I highly encourage you to check out David Burns' podcast he has a few episodes on resistance that are more in depth. I would give you a link to it but it's against the rules of the subreddit :( 

A concept he talks about often is a magic button. And if you press the magic button, your depression/anxiety/anger/addiction or whatever it is goes away in an instant. Now the first instinct is to say yes please I wish I could hit a button to make it go away. But when we take the time to think about it, often we come to the realization that you have come to, and that is that a part of us doesn't want to change. We actually view our problem as the solution, something that helps us. I can't say what it would be for you but you got to ask yourself what it would mean for your self-pity or anger to go away and why you might not want it to go away. For me I struggle with anxiety. And my resistance is that if I suddenly stopped worrying then everything would fall apart. My anxiety makes me feel protected in a way because it's my subconscious attempt to control my life and if I pressed a button to make it go away, I would lose control. 

It takes time and effort but there are a lot of techniques you can use to breakdown this resistance I believe identifying it is the hardest step. Another concept after using the magic button technique is to say ok what if it was a dial instead of a button. Because the resistance in some cases will never go away completely. That has been the case for me with anxiety so far. But with the magic dial I can say ok I don't want to hit a button and make it go away, but what I would do is turn a dial from 100% anxiety to maybe 20%. I can look at my anxiety and realize the benefits it does have in motivating me and protecting me in some situations, but also realize that if left unchecked, it can be paralyzing and overwhelming. 

I hope this helps you in some way and I urge you to look into yourself some more! I will leave you with a quote from a class I took about self-pity and maybe it can help you be more willing to let go of that resistance if it applies to you. Best of luck to you on your journey!

""Pity is an emotion that often brings about emotional intimacy with others as we share in their pain. Pity can also motivate us to take action on the part of another person. Self-pity is the process of turning an emotion inward that is meant to bring about emotional intimacy with others; thereby blocking our ability to emotionally connect with others. Ironically, self-pity is driven by a desire for emotional intimacy. It can become an addictive behavior as we seek the pity of others in an attempt to connect emotionally. But, since it is difficult to connect emotionally with someone whose focus is inward, that need goes unmet, which increases the self-pity; thus a vicious cycle begins. It can become a thirst that is never satisfied and can become an addictive behavior. Many would rather live with their self-pity because they don't know how they can live without it. They adopt the identity of a victim and want to stay that way."""
Meditation,fe070za,t3_eni4z9,1578804721.0,"David Burns, one of the pioneers of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, addresses this resistance with every patient at the start of every therapeutic relationship. In all of us, even those who want to change, have some type of subconscious resistance to change that needs to be broken down before we can really change. You are on the right path now that you have identified it"

CBT,fdnutp0,t1_fdmduf9,1578593288.0,"You feel bad because of the interpretation of the things that have happened and the negative thoughts that cause negative feelings. Identifying the thoughts and messages you are telling yourself is the first and hardest step. The next is finding the resistance as to why you might not want to change your thought patterns. It does take time and motivation but I believe it really does help. CBT and more specifically TEAM therapy saved my life and I hope you give it some more time and practice. The book mentioned is great because it's impossible to change or respond to your negative thoughts without writing them down and identifying the distortions in them. David Burns also has a podcast that you could check out I recommend just listening the first episode and see what you think. But please give it another shot and if you still don't think it's right I hope you find what works for you. Best wishes!

The best and most simple proof that it can work is your response to what I wrote. If you are hopeful it is because you are telling yourself ""hey this might work out and I'll be happy."" Or if you feel indifferent or unhappy it could be because you are telling yourself ""oh this won't work nothing will work I'm hopeless."" Our thoughts are very powerful in affecting how we feel and it takes time to change their patterns especially if you are like me and have been a negative thinker for your whole life"
LifeProTips,fdlgrv3,t3_elxmr5,1578523684.0,"Not a good tip. The real tip would be accept whatever embarrassing thing you did because you are human and it happens and you can't go back and change it. I don't think about embarrassing things other people did very often but there are some people that I think of and I associate that embarrassing moment with them. Or if I see them in person I think of it, so to say no one else thinks about it is simply not true and is not a helpful tip"
dbtselfhelp,fdhn7vm,t3_eladwu,1578426220.0,"I found my success through TEAM therapy which is primarily CBT but also pulls from other schools of therapy. I have only recently started looking at DBT as another strategy to handle life situations but I still want to share my success story because I believe hope is the most potent antidepressant in existence. 

Last year in February I was moderately depressed with occasional suicidal ideation. But everything got far worse when I took a marijuana edible and had my first panic attack. Everyday for 4 weeks after that I had panic attacks and thoughts of killing myself and the depression got so bad I wouldn't get out of bed for days at a time. I had to take a leave of absence from work for 1 month. The doctor put me on Zoloft and Xanax and I did therapy for 8 weeks. None of this helped me. The three different therapists I tried all listed CBT and DBT as their schools of specialty yet none of them, as I found out later, really used CBT or DBT techniques. The first therapist told me she wasn't equipped to help me. The second only talked about his problems. And the final one only listened to me talk and thought the solution to my suffering was finding a new job. She was more of a life coach than a therapist as finding a new job was definitely a wish of mine, I needed to address the panic attacks and the depression first.

What helped me get better was TEAM therapy which was invented by David Burns. He wrote a couple books called Feeling Good and When Panic Attacks, back in his CBT days. He also has a podcast which introduces TEAM therapy and literally saved my life. His idea is for the therapist to become the patient's subconscious mind, and for the patient to learn to defeat the negative thoughts and beliefs that are causing the suffering, as well as defeating the resistance of the patient along the way. I encourage you to at least listen to the very first episode of his podcast and see what you think. Other than that, all I can say is that this is what worked for me but everyone is different and I hope everything works out for you, and that I wish you the best!"
selfimprovement,fdhjdfy,t3_elbtt2,1578423890.0,"Hey there sorry to hear all that about 2019 :( My 2019 was rough as well especially in the beginning but it got much better in the second half. I was suicidal early last year and honestly never thought it would get better. I tried therapy for a couple months as well as going on Zoloft. Neither of these things helped me, and this was just my experience, but the three therapists I went to listened to my story and would be encouraging but that was the extent of it. Zoloft did nothing for me as well except make me even more suicidal for the first 2 weeks I was on it. I did not make any improvement until I heard about David Burns. The man who popularized and refined Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I read his books Feeling Good and When Panic Attacks, as well as started listening to his podcast. I learned to identify the negative thoughts and beliefs that produced my depression and anxiety and defeat them. Please, please check him out. I try to tell everyone I can about him because he literally saved my life. I know that when you are depressed it can be difficult to even get out of bed trust me I have been there. At the very least listen to the very first episode of his podcast and see what you think. Hope is the most potent antidepressant in existence and I want to share it with you. You'll make it out of this just fine. I am no longer on Zoloft and 2020 is looking to be the best year of my life at 23 years old. If I got through it, you can get through it too. Best of wishes and if you have any questions or need advice I will gladly try to help!"
