There are so many other details you gloss over when claiming it’s just advanced secret high tech shit...

This advanced technology in our hands would be batshit, paradigm shifting scientific progress, it would be bigger than Atomic energy it would be bigger than Einstein. These objects were moving from 80,000 ft in the air to 20,000 feet in the air in an instant. Please read Commandor Fravor’s account of what happened. Any human being inside of one of these aircrafts neck would be snapped a hundred times over. This shit is inertia dampening and it left zero exhaust trail it was all caught on FLIR radar it is advanced military sensors they’re using. 

I’m well aware it almost certainly isn’t aliens but I don’t think it’s as simple as just being advanced technology."
