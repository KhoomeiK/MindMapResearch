Though it’s still unmistakable. Others may have differing opinions depending on strain, fan/airflow setup and filters."

todayilearned,ffk1m5h,t1_ffk18k6,1580013036.0,One could argue that in this sense combat is correct (which it is) because that’s how you spell it.  The game chose to use the K probably for aesthetics.  And since the poster isn’t replying to anything video game related just making a reference I agree that using the correct spelling is much more sensible.

natureismetal,ffjaoka,t1_ffj71vv,1579994343.0,"Good.  I mean it’s visually obvious, look at the bottom of the stem; clearly it was pulled from where it actually grew.
