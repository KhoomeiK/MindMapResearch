curlyhair,fey7gc9,t1_fey0ffx,1579441763.0,It might not hurt to reevaluate the conditioner. I believe it has silicone and that can affect your curls. Some people do fine with silicones even though they aren't considered CG friendly. Have you clarified recently?
delusionalcraigslist,fevta5f,t1_fet40wr,1579401205.0,"Coming from someone who lives in a yee-haw area where hunting/fishing/taxidermy are common, I have seen many nests like this used in nature themed decor and taxidermy arrangements."
todayilearned,feul0zm,t1_feuem34,1579387555.0,"I know if I were homeless, I would try to go someplace warm too, I know how cold it is in winter. It's not hard to see why people don't want to freeze to death."
todayilearned,fetrgrk,t1_fetg62s,1579378923.0,Yeah and the places receiving the homeless people are overwhelmed with them already.
todayilearned,fetrd39,t1_fetr8c5,1579378849.0,"Yes, the homeless problem there is so overwhelming because of this."
todayilearned,feth77w,t1_fetghvx,1579375431.0,"It's very sad, we had some smaller tent cities in the summer, but people up here don't realize they pale in comparison to the ones out west and down south."
todayilearned,fetdexs,t1_fetb5h2,1579374199.0,"I can understand why though, winter is hard enough for those that have basic necessities loke shelter and food."
todayilearned,fetd6zf,t1_fetaswt,1579374117.0,Exactly and people wonder why.
todayilearned,fet8hus,t1_fet851g,1579372751.0,"Exactly, and there are people up here trying to provide space and resources for needy people, but the greed of some people is making it so there isn't enough to go around. So they basically say, ""Go south or west if you don't want to freeze to death."""
todayilearned,fet4b10,t1_fet3z3u,1579371712.0,Yes they just keep rotating these people around to other places in hopes someone else will deal with it.
todayilearned,fet452m,t1_fet1tbb,1579371660.0,"To be honest, I don't know if they said the destination. I just remember that they said it was someplace warmer."
todayilearned,fet21br,t1_fet0yxi,1579371083.0,"Homeless people get treated like they are migratory. The north sends them South and west in winter. If they can get by for the winter, many wind up back north come warmer weather when the tourist destinations don't want them around. And it just keeps on perpetuating."
todayilearned,fesys94,t1_fesyial,1579370251.0,Yes it is true. All these states play musical bus tickets and basically hand these people off to one another over and over. And the only thing they care about is not having to deal with them

todayilearned,fesv0cd,t1_feskb50,1579369270.0,"To be fair, if I had to choose, I would leave. When we have nights I can hear the wind howling and it's well below zero, I feel very sad for those on the street."
todayilearned,fesuu7d,t1_feskfhv,1579369214.0,"Yeah, it's basically like, ""You can be homeless, thats fine, you just can't do it here."""
todayilearned,fesumgj,t1_fesu25v,1579369171.0,"Yup, basically all these states just keep handing homeless people off to each other."

todayilearned,ferw1nz,t1_ferrsme,1579358969.0,"I am in Maine and at the end of this fall, one of the cities here didn't provide assistance, they just offered bus tickets for the people that wanted to leave and be homeless in a warmer city."

BuyItForLife,fec5113,t1_fec12rh,1578966748.0,I have been doing a lot of the same as well. I like to learn as many skills for self sufficiency as I am able to and pass on what I have learned to anyone who wants to learn.

BuyItForLife,feasbee,t1_feaqkf3,1578951812.0,"I live in a rural area where most of the farms are small ones, so I still see many of the old timer farmers, but I do agree that they seem to be getting pushed out by the commercial farmers in other areas."
BuyItForLife,fe9mtg7,t1_fe92bmf,1578939515.0,"Wow thank you for all that information, I knew they had other offerings, but I didn't realize there was such a variety of products. It's good to hear some feedback on them!"

BuyItForLife,fe8uw5l,t1_fe8mfg2,1578931146.0,"My current car is a 2007 and it is a base model so there aren't a whole lot of electronic or computer features, so when it needs something, I usually go to Rock Auto or Kenny U-Pull, but I worry that I won't know what to do with a car much newer than mine. I think things like this having a lot to do with farmers seeking vintage AG equipment."

BuyItForLife,fe87klr,t1_fe8710q,1578923482.0,"To be honest, this is one thing that worries me about buying a new car. We never go to a mechanic because we do it all ourselves, but it is getting to the point now that there are some things on newer cars you just cannot do yourself."
BuyItForLife,fe84xj7,t1_fe81pgj,1578922624.0,"I am glad they are still working for you, but that is quite disappointing when you have something you feel is tried and true and then you find out that the product's quality isn't quite the same. There are many things that I have found vintage or used will out last so many new things today."
BuyItForLife,fe84m7f,t1_fe837cc,1578922500.0,"I hope they work well for you! I know my parent's dog will not let them come within an inch of his nails, but when they bring them to have them done, he is a perfect angel."

BuyItForLife,fe7ifp1,t1_fe6oqeb,1578914957.0,"I had one dog that had unbelievably thick nails. She was my first dog and living in a rural area, I was limited on options close to me (basically only cheap clippers). I asked my vet what I was doing wrong and he said it's likely awful clippers and suggested these. He was right on."
BuyItForLife,fe7i6ig,t1_fe6mu9u,1578914839.0,My dogs nails get trimmed about once a week. I just do very small amounts and it works better that way for me.
BuyItForLife,fe7i3bc,t1_fe6mrc5,1578914800.0,They are definitely surprisingly rugged.

BuyItForLife,fe6byra,t1_fe6b3si,1578886552.0,The big thick nails can be more difficult for sure. I had a boxer who had very thick nails and it was more difficult to take care of hers than the pitbulls.
BuyItForLife,fe6bull,t1_fe6an7a,1578886466.0,I like to see other people have good luck with them too.
BuyItForLife,fe6btaa,t1_fe6an0l,1578886438.0,"I have not used their other products, but I would be interested in checking them out."
BuyItForLife,fe69vba,t1_fe67snf,1578885026.0,I think that would depend on the type of coat your dog has. My dog has short and relatively fine hair so I use a medium bristle brush as well as a soft bristle horse face brush from Tractor Supply.
BuyItForLife,fe69p48,t1_fe64qyw,1578884904.0,I definitely swear by them!
BuyItForLife,fe69o48,t1_fe63rar,1578884885.0,I think I just happen to have had tolerant dogs. My current dog did not do well with it for a while until he got older.
BuyItForLife,fe69lqz,t1_fe63ael,1578884839.0,"I wouldn't use these for cats, they seem like they'd be too much. I believe the same company makes a cat specific model that is more appropriately sized."
BuyItForLife,fe69j6n,t1_fe62cp7,1578884790.0,"Yes the dremel gives such nice results, but I had to stop using it because my dog just wouldn't have it."
BuyItForLife,fe69gl2,t1_fe618n9,1578884738.0,They seem to be popular with vets and groomers I have seen.
BuyItForLife,fe69edt,t1_fe6090a,1578884696.0,I know they work very well. Unfortunately my dog is bothered by it (I'm not sure of it is the sound or the feeling of it) so i had to give up the dremel.
BuyItForLife,fe5yx6p,t1_fe5yh7s,1578878040.0,I lucked out and I have had all dogs with very light colored nails so I can easily see the quick. I have cut other dogs nails that were black and I was super nervous to do it.
BuyItForLife,fe5yrqk,t1_fe5y5l0,1578877944.0,"I think the size or thickness of the nail can certainly make a difference. My mom has a smaller dog that his nails could be cut with good nail clippers, but i could not come close to cutting my dogs claws with that style of clipper."
BuyItForLife,fe5n9wz,t1_fe5mg71,1578871674.0,That is good to hear. I have had a number of pros say they use them.
BuyItForLife,fe5lvsa,t1_fe5imnq,1578871103.0,"Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I wonder if they just didn't live up or if they have changed the manufacturing quality in recent years. That is such a sad reality for many once loved reliable brands."
BuyItForLife,fe5lqid,t1_fe5iks8,1578871017.0,"Well I am lucky that he has light nails so I can easily see the quick. But the biggest thing is not taking a lot off the nail, just small amounts. And  being confident and steady helps with clean cuts."
BuyItForLife,fe5lba1,t1_fe5ig26,1578870925.0,I have been super impressed by the durability.
BuyItForLife,fe5l6nn,t1_fe5huai,1578870875.0,They definitely do look a bit aggressive.
BuyItForLife,fe5fav0,t1_fe5da89,1578868799.0,"Yes, my vet recommended them to me, I was glad I got them."
BuyItForLife,fe5f95l,t1_fe55ocp,1578868776.0,"They look scary, but they are sharp and cut smoothly so they are safer to use because they don't tend to crack the nails."
BuyItForLife,fe5f5eb,t1_fe55aob,1578868727.0,"That's awesome to hear, I hope mine continue on strong too!"
BuyItForLife,fe5f3vm,t1_fe50jry,1578868706.0,I hope they work out for you!
BuyItForLife,fe5f207,t1_fe4zp9k,1578868680.0,"I know that my dog eventually grew to at least tolerate it after about a year or so, but some peoples dogs don't take to it well. 

With my dog, it was just very small introductions to it and making it as pleasant as possible. My mom's dog though still has to have his done professionally because he is not cooperative."
BuyItForLife,fe5ethk,t1_fe4u3cd,1578868571.0,"I totally understand. One of mine was like that, but luckily it seems like he grew out of it. It took over a year to get him to really take to being ok with it, but I know some dogs never really get used to it."
BuyItForLife,fe5eng0,t1_fe4rix4,1578868487.0,"I have not sharpened them yet, but I think it might be a good idea. I have a chainsaw file that would probably work."

BuyItForLife,fe5eanu,t1_fe4now9,1578868304.0,"My vet was the one that told me about them, he showed them to me and told me I could find them online, so I ordered them the next day."
BuyItForLife,fe5e4nn,t1_fe4in2u,1578868238.0,"I would not use these for a cat, they are too large and thick bladed IMO and I think something smaller would be better."
BuyItForLife,fe5dqa3,t1_fe46oec,1578868183.0,I've definitely been impressed with them.
BuyItForLife,fe3tq5x,t1_fe3rhzf,1578852758.0,"Thanks for the tip, I'll have to keep my eyes out for a set of those. I am pleased with the orange ones, but I would not be against trying out the red handles for sure."
BuyItForLife,fe3td4g,t1_fe3slps,1578852677.0,"I did try this for a while, and it came to pass that neither dog would tolerate it. I was hoping they would take to it because it seemed less likely to damage the nail and they were so smooth."
BuyItForLife,fe3aizp,t1_fe3a910,1578847524.0,I hope the quality has remained in current production because these have been really tough clippers.

curlyhair,fdgr0e1,t1_fdfocql,1578406069.0,"Thank you for sharing this. That personal note on loving things that are authentically you hits home big time for me.
