So even if we plateau in 80 years, that’s still 11 billion people all trying to live amongst each other in peace. It’s a recipe for disaster. 

Btw, that’s not the “consensus”.... there are countless different statistics out there estimating different results, but nobody actually knows for sure. Not even close. I can find sources arguing a much higher population in 2100, and I can find the opposite just as easily. So to act like that’s common sense that everyone agrees with that point is asinine."

The more people there are, the more you will get different personalities, upbringings, etc.  Therefore, youre going to get even more disparity, more people not agreeing and arguing, more different cultures, ideologies, etc. That problem is going to continue to multiply as time goes on of course due to procreation. 

What i'm getting at is that: ""more people = more disagreeing = more arguing/fighting = more people being brought up with terrible ethics and role models = even more bull shit going on in the world""

Idk how you think  this problem is even close to being resolved ( I don't see any world peace within the next couple hundred if not thousands of years, or anything even close to it.)

I’m simply saying that it’s genuinely not that hard to fact check information to get an idea as to whether you can trust that source or not, and if so, how much. Regardless of what source you’re getting any information from, you should always get a second or third opinion or whatever you’d like to call it. From there, you can get a good idea as if they’re blowing smoke up your ass for propaganda, or if they tend to stick to facts. Sometimes it can be hard to know for sure if the source is correct or not, but you can get a good idea. And you can almost always tell when someone is writing propaganda or just plain false information. Just do a little bit of due diligence FFS.

I guess I’m forgetting that a large percentage of this population is not very bright and aren’t smart enough to use the tools they have to fact check something or whatever it takes to make sure that what you’re reading is legit.

And sometimes these sources think they’re right, and they’re wrong. So they’re not trying to mislead anyone, they just have their information wrong. That’s on the reader to dissect or others to confirm. 

It’s just really not that difficult to fact check information or do a little research."

1.) knew he was causing a form of torture on someone in the worst degree, 

2.) with number 1 in mind, he permanently and intentionally screwed up the kids life forever, even if the victim didn't end up dying.
