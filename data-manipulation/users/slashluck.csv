WatchRedditDie,ffvjn5n,t1_ffvfzrc,1580265680.0,Also gallowboob has millions of karma... years of experience with Reddit... and still posts content irrelevant to the sub he’s posting on...what a scrub. Amazing they unbanned him but like the mod above said... it’s free legwork and he does a lot of it.

AskReddit,ffgm9li,t1_fffk04s,1579909519.0,"This. I saw a magazine ad, iirc on Reddit, and it quoted something like “20% of homeless population are women”. I guess it’s easier than saying 80% of homeless are men?"
sports,ffdtla7,t1_ffctbs3,1579828601.0,"The woman closest to us hits her shot with so much backspin on the ball, it bounced on her opponents side and the spin made it bounce back over to her side of the net. Making it impossible for the receiver of that shot to reach the ball, therefore the woman who hit the ball last gets the point. Hope that’s clear enough. I almost confused myself typing it."

MadeMeSmile,ffd31hk,t1_ffcai0u,1579812434.0,"If possible, spend as much time as you can with her. My dad called me 4 years ago when I was 26. Said he had 6 months to live. I figured I would button up my responsibilities for a week and fly out to spend the rest of his life with him. He died 6 days after that phone call. Not 6 months. The clock isn’t always right. Isn’t always wrong in the sense that they outlive the doctors estimate. Sometimes that estimate is way off, and on the wrong side of the clock. Cherish them, hold them, if your relationship is rocky try to move forward with few regrets. Idk how to say it. I wish I had a time machine. Wish I left the day that call came in. There’s never enough time. Good luck."

AskReddit,fdt51ef,t1_fds6v21,1578712010.0,I’ve been unfortunately smoking for over a decade. I always use my ashtray or a bottle with a bit of liquid. Iirc it can be up to a felony here in Arizona for flicking your butts out the window...but what keeps me from doing is I’m not a fucking absent minded litter bug. Cigarette butts take an awfully long time to degrade. Birds and all types of wildlife eat them/use for nesting. It’s nasty. I don’t understand why people who otherwise wouldn’t litter have no problem throwing a lit ciggy out the window. It’s sad and ridiculous.

australia,fddkwuc,t3_ekqhtj,1578316213.0,"So happy she’s ok. It really puts the speed and unpredictability of these fires in perspective. This is a cat. With insane reflexes and pretty good at running fast. Yet she still has burns and singed hair. If an apex predator that can sprint fast and agile can’t get away from the fires, humans/most other animals are absolutely screwed. Happy she made it, OP. Can’t imagine how you felt when you first saw her. Excellent news."
