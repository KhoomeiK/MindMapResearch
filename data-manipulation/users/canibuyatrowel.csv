instantkarma,ffjjslv,t1_ffjguu4,1579999829.0,"Is it not? When you announce to the world that you represent an organization, there has got to be a level of understanding that you represent that organization to the public. If I am wearing a police uniform and I take a shit on someone's car, is it ""not fair at all to me"" if my ability to represent the police force is questioned? She got an internship that hundreds or even thousands likely fight for, and the first thing she did was be disrespectful online. I don't think it would have been a problem if it had stopped at the first tweet, but I think nasa probably draws the line at telling people to suck their dick and balls."
AfterTheLoop,ffizrw4,t3_etlsto,1579986771.0,"I think the short answer is ""time caught up with McDonalds branding and nobody likes clowns as much as they (maybe) used to."" There's more nuance, of course, and rebranding attempts, and aspects of his persona that may still hang on. But the reality is, he likely just doesn't appeal to consumers anymore."

Wellthatsucks,fffi3pd,t1_ffeuvvx,1579884449.0,I'd have guessed 28. I'm 33 and teenagers/20 year olds look like babies to me sometimes. She looks the same age as most of my friends.
Wellthatsucks,fffhwj4,t1_ffeu65q,1579884324.0,"Why do you post to the teenagers subreddit? It's for teenagers...and their young minds, not just their young faces...to hang out. Don't you see how it's a bit weird to post your picture there? Like what's the end game? I'm weirdly fascinated by all this if I'm honest. I'm also wondering if you think it'd be creepy if a 35 year old man went out of his way to try to be around teenagers, even if only online...."
Wellthatsucks,fff3agb,t1_ffeyhf8,1579874547.0,Wait is she 35? She's been posting her photos in the teenagers subreddit...

Instagramreality,fdfq2co,t1_fdfgulq,1578367480.0,"Oh that's you in the picture? Congrats on your internet fame! It's not? Then why on earth do you think I'm targeting you personally? 

People can have feelings and opinions on what they find attractive, gross, etc. Are you aware that many women grow their armpit and leg hair out and are proud of it? Do you think that's gross...are you attracted to that? Maybe, maybe not...but you have an opinion, I'm sure. How about skinny members of your desired sex? Obese? Short hair? Long unkempt dreads? Tattoos? Do you get my point? All I was stating was that I personally am not attracted to it and I find it a bit weird that our culture/the media has occasionally collectively jumped on this ""GLORIOUS GLORIOUS MANLY MAN BEARD"" bandwagon. It's not a personal insult to you. It's a personal feeling of mine. Huge difference. Best of luck to you sir."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fcu3ut4,t1_fctn2n2,1577971836.0,"My son's aren't too far removed from this. We don't have vision insurance and he needs stupid specialized lenses, different for each eye. That's the main thing. Then you add on the coatings that will help them not get scratched, etc. We actually drive an hour and a half away to get the glasses we prefer for him, in part because they're slightly less expensive, but also because they're more durable and therefore cheaper in the long run. Oh! And at this age, their prescription changes fairly often, so...multiply a sizable payment by a few times a year!"
