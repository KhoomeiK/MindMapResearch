4. I threw your point back at you, yes, in a sarcastic, asshole-ish way, because you think your interpretation of a comment is the Only Right One. Different people read things differently. Your interpretation of the comment may not be what OP intended. *My* interpretation of the comment may not be what OP intended. 

5. Of course you're allowed to make an observation. Just like I'm allowed to comment that I think you're missing the point of the original comment.
