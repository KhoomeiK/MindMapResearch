nutrition,ffyxdtj,t3_evuboj,1580357561.0,"I realized that in my personal diet, these “uber healthy foods” are detrimental to my health. I peck at some of my lunches because certain things we have taste almost unbearable. I feel hungrier in the afternoon and overeat better tasting food from home. I know that’s my fault, but I don’t eat as much from home on days where school lunch is good. Idk if that’s just me or if others have this problem. However, I’m changing my diet to include more healthy foods and breakfast and dinner. I’m a lot slimmer now than I was at this time last year and it has really made me realize how big I was."

I’m glad it exists because it keeps all of you away from the civilized one where I can speak my mind and people can either have a debate or agree."

BattlefrontII,ffuuewc,t1_ffu72h0,1580249533.0,"What’s the point of posting if ignorant fools won’t read the original post entirely? I stated the he required the same skill as the others. If he is “easy” to someone, then all of the heroes should be fairly easy. Whenever I say I main Dooku, people make sure they point out that he is easy. Why Dooku specifically?! Whatever they main is easy too! This isn’t some super hard game."
BattlefrontII,fftam2n,t1_ffsl7xm,1580214553.0,"Shut the fuck up. A hero that takes skill? When you sum it up, every god damned hero requires spamming the controller trigger and the ability to block.

BattlefrontII,ffsd1cs,t1_ffscpf8,1580178786.0,I have been passive for as long as I can stand. I am growing frustrated at the fact that bf2 redditors can’t let anyone criticize anything or voice an opinion about the game without resorting to saying “you’re just mad because you’re bad”. I am sick of it. No one can have a civil debate or say anything negative in the slightest on these subreddits.

BattlefrontII,ffsc42s,t1_ffrjxsr,1580178177.0,Repeating such a childish chant doesn’t do anything but make you look like a fool. Go back to playing as Anakin and thinking you’re good because you can play an overpowered character.
BattlefrontII,ffsby0j,t1_ffrdx9x,1580178065.0,"You know who is easy? Anakin, Maul, Luke, Vader, Phasma, and just about every fucking character in the game. Idgaf if your 10 y/o nephew is good with Dooku. Anyone can PLAY and get a few kills, but being GOOD with the character is different."
