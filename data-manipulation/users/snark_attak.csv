GetMotivated,ff45urt,t1_ff38xdr,1579556206.0,"I don't disagree with your premise. But maybe you were getting downvoted for not know that Acura is the luxury brand from Honda (whose standard models are already often considered higher end that Toyota, Hyundai, Kia, or other economy brands). Or maybe just not being able to spell Acura."

25 years ago (around when the Somali refugees began arriving), Bill Clinton was president. Are you saying he's a ""former Muslim""? Also, your article says MN is where refugees ended up largely due to non-governmental voluntary agencies, specifically including Lutheran Social Services and Catholic Charities. Are they part of this former Muslim conspiracy you're trying to sell? I guess they must be, since even if all the Somali refugees in MN live in the 5th Congressional district, that's still less than 5% of the population of the district."
GetMotivated,fdepue2,t1_fdc8emk,1578344109.0,"Not exactly. However, excessive over-consumption of water can cause Hyponatremia -- abnormally low levels of electrolytes (principally sodium) in the blood -- which can potentially kill you (quite rare, especially in otherwise healthy people). However, even if you misinterpret the intent of the post like OP did, and add one cup every day without regard to what the optimum level is, 30 cups of water a day (10 oz per hour, on average) is unlikely to cause any problems, except perhaps excessive trips to the bathroom (normal kidneys can excrete ~30-38 oz per hour). If you did it all (30 cups, or 7 liters... a bit less than two gallons) in a short time -- less than 3 hours or so -- you could be at risk, depending on your size, hydration level when you started, etc...."
GetMotivated,fdekr9h,t1_fdaryqs,1578341111.0,"I agree, but you can do both: definitely reconnect with the positive influences, but disconnect (at least temporarily) with the bad influences that might hold you back, if you need to."
GetMotivated,fb5uykz,t1_fb568zo,1576534836.0,"That seems like a pretty frank and detailed response. Anyway, having an ex-fiancee is probably better than trying to make it work for too long and ending up with an ex-wife. Good luck to you."
