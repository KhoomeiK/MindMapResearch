There are many different avenues to try to prevent something like that other than a baby drop off box.  Easy access to abortions, getting the baby an adopted family before they are born, etc.

If for no other reason than I assume for most mothers, something like this is very emotionally draining.  If they know an adopted family for the baby is going to take care of them, that must be a huge relief over a baby drop box."

He said every billionaire he contacted directly wanted nothing to do with him, they wanted their true wealth to be as secret as possible.

With the sole exception of Donald Trump, who would personally phone him multiple time to let him know how rich he was, even putting on fake voices and introducing himself as different people corroborating Trump's claims (including Trump's ""property manager"" bragging about how often Trump sleeps with women).  Most of his claims were inflated or lies of course.  But man, you'd think a real billionaire would have better things to do than try to lie about their wealth to magazine editors."

Sure, but Newton didn't know either of those. The second question of understanding why things are the way they are is not really in the realm of science, and nothing can give concrete answers to that.  The first one is essentially what defines theories vs. laws.

Newton never had an understanding of how gravity works (And neither do we).  We know how evolution works, etc. But gravity is basically ""Things with mass attract each other at a distance, unhindered by anything known by man and essentially by magic, and it follows these formulas"""
