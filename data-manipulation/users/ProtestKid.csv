MagicArena,ffflgdo,t3_etbgoc,1579886515.0,"I had somebody running an oven with stuff like [[Claim the Firstborn]] and [[Act of Treason]] . They kept bonking me over the head with my own rotting regisaurs, rankles, and Spawns of mayhem and then shoved them into the oven to power their [[Giant Opportunity]] . It was equal parts infuriating and hilarious."

MagicArena,fegvbly,t1_fegsn86,1579103346.0,"I started playing magic with arena, really enjoyed it, and have started playing paper magic as well. What's the point of spending money in arena on packs and drafting if afterwards those cards become obsolete and I can only play them during certain events and have to pay a fee to play with cards I already have."

fatlogic,fe8toqw,t1_fe8efml,1578930721.0,I started cycling 15 miles on my days off and eating salads everyday and the weight just started to melt off. Funny how reducing your caloric intake and increasing your number of calories burned equals to you burning your fat that's been stored.

BoomerTears,fd4mch2,t1_fd37xit,1578168845.0,"We have most definitely blown up innocent people and buildings. Where do you think the terrorists are getting their rage for America? I have no doubt that if Portugal blew up our homes and killed our families because they suspected we were going to harm them, we would want to take up arms and retaliate. Or do you believe the tired old excuse from Fox News that ""they hate us for our Freedom®“? 


To your next point, we had and continue to have a hard time fighting a bunch of religious goat herders. Iran has a legitimate army and forces in almost the entire Middle East and have a stronger economy than Australia. We would be fighting a war on a multitude of different fronts. This won't end well."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd2q004,t1_fd02mjo,1578150534.0,Thank you. Iran has been lashing out because we  accused them of noncompliance while every other nation said they were fine. We shot ourselves in the foot like always.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fd00366,t1_fczxan5,1578111598.0,"Up until now the US has been fighting religious sheep herders with little training. They're grown men who played a bunch of kids in football and have been prancing around like they won the superbowl. Iran has a legitimate army. They have both a conventional army and unconventional army, meaning they have forces in various other Middle Eastern countries. The US would be fighting a war across several fronts. On top of that they also have twice the money and man power that Iraq has. This is a nightmare."

Company policy is 10% off if you're in the military but like many discounts you can't combine them with other discounts. Thing is we're a pawnshop so most things being sold were discounted down due to haggling so you're better off just taking the haggled price. Some people would get irrationally angry and when that happened my boss would always tell them, ""So that was the reason you joined? So you could keep getting free shit after you were already done with a job that you were already getting paid to do? So that then if you deemed it too little or they didn't have one you could act like a jackass and make the rest of us look bad?"""

You listen to last podcast because they're able to give deeply horrifying information while also being funnier than hell to lighten the mood with jokes that make you feel guilty for laughing at.
