Starlight meanwhile: Created a cult that actively took cutie Mark's away, mind you, she was perfectly sound mind in comparison to Trixie's town take over. Messed up the timelines, repeatedly, but they forgave her for that.

You're right. Shes a knockoff Sunset, because at least with Sunset, you see doubt in the second movie. They believe her, but they don't actively trust her entirely.

Like the first Trixie episode- I absolutely wish they did it differently. Trixie was annoying, and I get the idea was not to be like that, but it didn't actually make me dislike Trixie all too much; if anything, it made the cast out of character to me.  Another that stood out to me had been Mysterious Mare Do Well; it could've been so much better if there had been communication. I've even seen this done better with the Manehattenverse. 

The biggest one I found had been One Bad Apple. I couldn't stand that episode precisely *because* the moral wasn't fitting with the rest of the episode. At least, to me. Are you telling me that *no one* had noticed the bullying? Absolutely *no one*? ""Tell an adult if you're having trouble"" falls flat when you wonder where the adults *are* in the episode- where was Mr. and Mrs.Cake when they had their shakes stolen? Rarity when they ambushed them in her shop? Applejack? It's worse when this is applied to the *other* ones, too.."
