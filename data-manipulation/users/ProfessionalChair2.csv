WhitePeopleTwitter,ff3sitl,t1_ff3rt6x,1579547908.0,You didn't read the article. He is dead right when it comes to the influence of silicon valley and their disconnection from the rest of the country. This kind of arrogance is EXACTLY what put Trump in office. Do not even mention Biden in the same breath as Trump. Biden is one of the most moral career politicians and that moral compass would be a giant step forward from Trump.

I do care about his opinion on Silcon Valley in general and I strongly agree with him that their arrogance is ridiculous. This is a quote from the rest of this article, ""And then one of these righteous people said to me that, you know, 'We are the economic engine of America. We are the ones.' And fortunately, I had done a little homework before I went and I said, you know, I find it fascinating. As I added up the seven outfits, everyone’s there but Microsoft. I said you have fewer people on your payroll than all the losses that General Motors just faced in the last quarter, of employees.

All of these people are getting themselves spun up over nothing and the net will be none of these people will show up to vote in the general to vote for Biden. What will happen is Trump's social media team will do a full-court press (as will Russia) to convince all these disenfranchised and disappointed millennials to stay home.

Here are some actual facts from a reputable science powerhouse- the NIH. Not one anecdote on an actor that you appear to be an expert on. 

Source: https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana

Breathing problems. Marijuana smoke irritates the lungs, and people who smoke marijuana frequently can have the same breathing problems as those who smoke tobacco. These problems include daily cough and phlegm, more frequent lung illness, and a higher risk of lung infections. Researchers so far haven't found a higher risk for lung cancer in people who smoke marijuana.

Increased heart rate. Marijuana raises heart rate for up to 3 hours after smoking. This effect may increase the chance of heart attack. Older people and those with heart problems may be at higher risk."
