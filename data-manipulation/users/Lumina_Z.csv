Trophies,feshhbo,t3_eox3n8,1579365183.0,"Congrats! 350 hours isn't even that much, considering the amount of grinding required!

I still want to get the plat for this game after coming back from a break. I have yet to grind for the 1k FATEs and 1k leves, but the one that will give me more trouble is the Seeker of Truth, probably for T5. I'm about to enter SB soon so I'm just level 60, and WTs are no more, so I doubt I'll find anyone willing to do that content hahah. Guess I'll have to wait until lvl 80 so I can solo as DPS."
Trophies,fesgje9,t1_femo49c,1579364920.0,"I play on PS4 and must say it's actually pretty smooth! You mainly hold either L2 or R2 and then press directionals or the main buttons, thus giving you easy access to 8 actions per trigger. Also there's additional shortcuts such as holding both L2 and R2 and having 8 more button presses. In the end, you have access to 24 actions. Pressing R1 also gives you an entire extra hotbar to circle through with triggers, should you need more actions or customization.

You can alternatively play with mouse and keyboard like you would on a PC should you prefer. The UI is also highly customizable, you can set different sizes and drag and drop the elements to your liking. I personally play with the controller, and have a keyboard just for being able to type faster and chat and I sometimes use a mouse when I want to custom my HUD.

I actually just came back to the game after a 2 year break. It's an amazing fun and friendly game, and even though I just played for about 5 months before going into a break, it's intuitive enough that I'm getting the hang of it again swiftly. :)"
