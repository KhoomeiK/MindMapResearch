UpliftingNews,ffo9as7,t1_ffnqzh4,1580075329.0,"Thats a good option too. The others are for if you plan on having children later.

Its not just women, men play a part in making a baby too.

People are hostile about it because of the huge amount of people who have children they cant care for because they were too irresponsible to use protection. So much so that apparently a baby drop off box is needed.

Yes accidents happen, sonetimes a couples not ready but they make it work, but theres waaaay more who just have unprotected sex and dont care about the consequences ."

There also plan B, spermicide, IUDs, patches.

If someone knows they cant afford a child, don't want a child, they should take ever measure to be responsible when having sex to make 99% sure it doesn't happen. Yes of course even with all that theres still a teeny tiny possibility but more often than not, people getting pregnant who don't want babies are the ones using just the pull out method, not taking birth control properly or plain just think theyll get lucky.

Yes, condoms break, yes BC fails but you can still protect yourself about 99% by just using multiple forms of contraception."
