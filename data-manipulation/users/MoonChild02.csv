I don't think I've heard anything bad about Tom Hiddleston, either.

Tom Hanks is pretty awesome. 

So is Betty White.

Brian, Wendy, and Toby Froud (artists for The Dark Crystal) are extremely sweet and kind.

And we can all still look up to Mr. Rogers and Bob Ross."

SubredditDrama,ffbel37,t1_ffbeaed,1579761941.0,"I don't know. Honestly. My parents sing it like that because their friends from Northern Ireland, a few of who were Irish Republicans chased out of the country during the Troubles, sing it that way."

They said it was to help with legal funds for the political prisoners, to provide money for political campaigns like for Gerry Adams, and support the Good Friday Agreement. Though, yes, they do know some former IRA members.

I just passed around a petition for people to sign supporting the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process. That was all I ever did for them."

Low lie the fields of Athenry

Where once we watched the small free birds fly

Our love was on the wing

We had dreams and songs to sing

My parents were members of Irish Northern Aid, which was an American partner of Sínn Fein, before their local chapter went defunct a few years ago. I know *so* many rebel songs. I like ""Rock on Rockall"".

Oh rock on Rockall you'll never fall

For Britains greedy hands

Oh you'll meet the same resistance

Like you did in many lands

May the Seagulls rise and pluck your eyes

And the water crush your shell

And the natural gas will burn your ass

And blow you all to hell"

news,ffajr0w,t1_ffa92t4,1579737457.0,"There were kings in Ireland way before the fall of Rome. The kings were the ones who had the most cattle, and so were the ones in charge of taking care of the people and keeping order in the land. They had enough resources that they could make sure others survived.

There was a hierarchy of kings, too. There was the Ard-Rí, who was like a high king, or king over the country, often called the King of Tara (which was then the capital city); then the Rí Ruirech, the provincial kings; Rí Mór-Tuath, or kings of many clans/people; and Rí Tuath, kings of a single clan/people. They all met a couple times a year to go over laws, the goings-on in the country, keeping peace, and whatnot together."
SubredditDrama,ffabk78,t3_eshmot,1579731692.0,"I love that the mods linked to ""Come Out Yet Black and Tans"" by the Wolfe Tones, calling it a national treasure, and insinuating that Trumpers are like the [Black and Tans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_Tans). That's hilarious! 

They're not even close to what the Black and Tans were (terrifying racist police force who killed Catholics and Irish Republicans for being what they were, including the children, teaming with the Orangemen (British equivalent of KKK who hate the Irish) and the British Army, to enforce their legal right to do all of what they did), but they're probably the closest we have currently in the US."

Marvel,ff0fe5y,t1_fezhzoy,1579468339.0,">I mean, they make cap a NAZI then kill him and replace him with a clone.

That's not quite what happened.

Kobik/the Cosmic Cube had been convinced by Red Skull that Hydra was good (Thunderbolts vol 3 #12), and, having the mind of a child, she thought it was a game. When Kobik turned Steve Rogers young again (Avengers: Standoff!, Captain America: Sam Wilson #7), she replaced him with the man who turned out to be Stevil. The real Cap was stuck in Kobik's universe in the Cosmic Cube (Secret Empire, multiple issues). When the Cube was put back together (Secret Empire #10), Kobik released the real Cap from there, who then fought Stevil/Hydra Supreme. Stevil was then incarcerated in a maximum security penitentiary, in solitary confinement (Secret Empire Omega #1).

So, Cap isn't a clone. He's the real Steve Rogers. Stevil was from an alternate timeline/universe (Earth 61311) where a woman named Elisa Sinclair, who was actually Madame Hydra, interfered in his life.

The person who *was* killed and replaced with a clone is Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Secret Empire #7, Tales of Suspense #100-104)."

If your film is on your DVR, and you run out of space, the DVR will overwrite the longest thing on the disc. I learned that the hard way.

So, it's better to buy a hard copy of your favorite films."

He doesn't get on the internet a lot, so that's probably why the lingo passed him by. He's busy, and he doesn't need the anxiety it causes him."

So, I'm not sure if many people knew about it at all. We just knew the cosmetics were animal-friendly and of good quality. There were a lot of comments saying things like, ""Really? This sucks!""
