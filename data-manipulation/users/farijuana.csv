Hedgehog,ffjevfj,t3_etxwgu,1579996783.0,drinking excessive water can be a sign of diabetes in hedgehogs. most vets open in the morning so you should be able to get him to a vet sooner than you think.
Hedgehog,ffj5xpj,t3_etvqno,1579991221.0,"blue buffalo, chicken soup, I and Love and You, have some good foods. the main thing you want to make sure of is that the ingredients are high quality and the protein is 28-35% and fat is 10-15%. the food youre currently feeding is 22%! fat, which is only appropriate for hedgies when theyre young. it's also very very low in fiber, which hedgies need a lot of. by 6 months old, they should be transitioned to an adult formula"
Hedgehog,ffj512m,t3_etoh8o,1579990569.0,"wet foods can be too high in protein and fat in a lot of cases, you would need to make sure it's the right nutrient balance (28-35% protein, 10-15% fat) and has high quality ingredients. i personally would recommend a vet visit to rule out oral issues. hedgies are prone to not only dental problems but also oral cancer. another thing to consider is the DMB (dry matter basis), more about that here:  [https://www.hedgehogcentral.com/forums/12-diet-nutrition/19-soft-food-recommendations.html](https://www.hedgehogcentral.com/forums/12-diet-nutrition/19-soft-food-recommendations.html)"
Hedgehog,ffj4c21,t3_etrue8,1579990057.0,"i would not recommend a hedgie. theyre nocturnal so bonding should be done at night and they may keep your friend awake at night by running on the wheel or munching on food. they require lots of cleaning especially the wheel which many hedgie owners need to clean daily since it gets covered in poop. they require temperature management which can add to his parents electricity bills. my main concern is that ive read countless posts from kids who have pets that need vet care and their parents wont let them take it to the vet. exotic pet vet bills can get very expensive very quickly and with hedgehogs it's a matter of ""when"" not ""if"" they will need a vet since they are prone to cancer (mainly oral and reproductive), cysts, tumors, WHS, respiratory illness, dental problems, liver disease, obesity..."
Hedgehog,ffhsvpg,t3_etl3fq,1579952186.0,Yes this is factored in when the vet prescribed the dose.
Hedgehog,ffewn5y,t3_et8qac,1579868567.0,"You can put a ceramic tile/plate (marble or slate also works) in their cage. It should stay cool to the touch and hedgie can lay on it if they get too warm. You can use fans as long as they’re not pointed directly at the cage. Keep the blinds closed and use a lamp for light in the room. If the temperature drops at night, open the windows and take advantage of that cooler air and close the windows before it starts getting warm again to trap the cooler air in the room. You can also try evaporative cooling with a bucket of water or wet towel in front of the fan. Some hedgies are fine at them at temperature, and some even prefer it on the warmer side. But it’s always a good idea to give them the option of cooling off if it’s gonna be that warm. The main downside of trying to cool the room without using ac while you’re away is that you can’t monitor it and keep it from getting too cool, idk how possible that is tho tbh. There are wireless temperature monitors that you can check with your phone."

Hedgehog,ffdy3kg,t1_ffdxogj,1579831801.0,you could probably make some stuff that looks like water! mix some blue coloring with clear silicone caulk and texturize it to have like waves or ripples. embed little fish figurines so it looks like theyre swimming around lol
Hedgehog,ffdwtsv,t1_ffdwgxo,1579830893.0,hedgehogs that have spent their whole life together could potentially fight. it's pretty impossible to predict whether they will fight or not but i personally like to err on the side of caution and not take the chance but it's totally your call! you seem pretty set on this idea already tbh.
Hedgehog,ffdvyq7,t1_ffdv4h3,1579830281.0,"a wall may work, but it also might not. males can be very aggressive/territorial and may try to escape their enclosure to go after the other male. as for the falling, theyre your pets so if you want to take on the risk of them getting hurt, thats definitely your call, im just pointing out whats generally recommended for hedgehog enclosures. lukewarm water wont matter, since once they get wet and are not in the water, it starts evaporating off them causing them to be cold. even when you bathe hedgehogs, youre not supposed to put them back into their cage until they are dry."
Hedgehog,ffdu08p,t3_et1ifc,1579828892.0,"what sex are your hedgehogs? if one or both are male, they cannot be housed together no matter how much space or food/water bowls you have. hedgehog fights can be fatal and theyre solitary animals anyways, most of them very much prefer to be alone.

there shouldnt be any ledges or drops, why put them at risk of hurting themselves if you could just...not? there also shouldnt be any water that they could get into at all since if they get wet, they will get cold which can trigger a hibernation attempt/respiratory infection. are you able to heat the entire room to above 73F at all times?"

Hedgehogs,ffceq2y,t3_esvkjs,1579797871.0,"CHE bulbs with a thermostat is what's recommended for hedgies. The thermostat is important because it will turn the lamp on and off as needed to keep the cage the right temperature.

Hedgehog,ff9wsnd,t1_ff9va9n,1579723210.0,"i can only find 3 cat foods by that brand and theyre all too high in fat and 2 of them are too high in protein. protein should be 28-35% and fat 10-15%

have you tried getting a heavier or non-flippable bowl? i know they make bowls that can attach to a cage or suction to the cage bottom (stay bowls). you could also try velcro. sometimes hedgies will accidentally flip their bowl when they step up on the edge of it to get to the food inside, in this case a heavier bowl should fix things.

also be careful to not feed too much. some hedgies will overeat so they need to have their food rationed. generally hedgies should have about 2 tbsp food daily."
Hedgehog,ff9rjr2,t1_ff9r2c1,1579719554.0,"it's not really that strange tbh. ive read a lot about co-habbing hedgies and from what i can tell, it can be pretty sudden when they decide they no longer want to tolerate each other. hedgies that have spent their whole lives together have been seen turning on each other and it can get very nasty, hedgies have some wicked teeth! i know ive seen males use the pushing technique you described when they are fighting over a female. males will also do it to a female when trying to mate. ive not read about females doing it to each other, but it's still possible it is an aggressive behavior, especially considering the size disparity between the two. i always prefer to stay on the safe side and not provide my pets a chance to harm each other but as long as you are supervising them closely, you should be able to separate them before any harm comes to them."
Hedgehog,ff9r3vk,t3_esfsh2,1579719212.0,"hedgies are not like cats and dogs who bond quickly. it can take months or longer to bond with them and some hedgies never really warm up to humans. keep a shirt with your smell in his cage and continue daily handling. try to keep bonding to night time hours, waking them up often during the day can make then grumpy since they are nocturnal animals. talk to them when youre approaching the cage and while you have them out so they can get used to your voice. you can wear a hoodie backwards and put the hedgie in the hood while you do whatever around the house."
Hedgehog,ff9qryj,t1_ff9q6nq,1579718948.0,"ah ok, im glad to hear theyre already living separately, it wasnt clear from your initial post, thats why i went into that point in my comment. yes, continue the supervised play as long as no ones biting. if the bigger one is constantly pushing and bothering the smaller one, it would be best to not do playtime together, we dont want the little one getting too stressed out. sounds like youre doing well and paying close attention to their behavior! =]"

you can contact this rescue, they have a permit to care for exotic animals. they are about an hour from LA and might be able to help."
Hedgehogs,ff9mxtq,t1_ff9eb84,1579716361.0,"illegally owning an animal is very selfish. because theyre illegal, they arent able to be seen by a vet, and you are putting them at risk of being euthanized and getting yourself a fine to the tune of like $500-10,000 dollars plus having to pay and costs associated with the animal's removal, storage and care. you can also be charged criminally with a misdemeanor and may be sentenced to up to 6 months in jail or a fine of up to $1000."
Hedgehog,ff9m6z0,t3_es3d4g,1579715918.0,"are you housing the two hedgies together? hedgehogs are solitary animals, so it's definitely possible that it was aggressive behavior. when housing 2 hedgies together you need to provide them with 2 of everything, food/water dishes, wheels, hides. even hedgies that have always been together can start fighting, usually without any warning. i personally am against housing hedgehogs together because they are naturally solitary and get no benefit from having a cagemate. ive read posts where one hedgie has actually killed the other, especially when they are different in size. the larger one tends to dominate the smaller one and can prevent it from eating, using the wheel, etc and just generally stressing them out. high stress levels lead to a shortened lifespan. do you have a second cage and heat setup so that you can separate them?"
Hedgehog,ff9ladl,t3_es3o8q,1579715387.0,"sometimes you have to offer treat food several times before hedgies will take to them. but it's not the end of the world if they dont want treats. as long as their regular cat food is good quality with the right ingredients, they shouldnt need any supplemental food."
Hedgehog,ff9l2js,t3_es3yvx,1579715259.0,"try squishing the live worms, sometimes hedgies cant tell what they are and squishing them helps them smell them better. i usually squish the heads because mealworms can actually bite. careful to not feed too many as they can upset hedgie's phosphorus balance. other insects you can try are dubia roaches, crickets, black soldier fly larvae, and grasshoppers."

Hedgehog,ff9ksc9,t3_esblyc,1579715092.0,how often do you give him fresh food and what food are you feeding?
Hedgehog,ff9knll,t3_esc35x,1579715014.0,"the main thing that stands out for me is the tight budget. while initial and monthly costs are relatively cheap, when hedgies get sick (and they will, it's more of a question of ""when"" not ""if"") they need to be seen by an exotic vet which can be expensive. hedgehogs are prone to lots of health issues, cancer, tumors, cysts, teeth problems, WHS, respiratory infections, bowel issues. health issues can pop up really quickly and take you by surprise. 

i would not recommend taking hedgehog with you on weekends as disrupting their routine can cause issues like food strike which can be dangerous for their health. taking them back and forth between places can get very stressful for the hedgie as they usually need time to adjust to the new sounds, smells, etc of the new environment. 

will you be ok with a pet that could possibly take a long time to warm up to you? lots of people can get frustrated by how standoffish hedgies can be, theyre not like dogs and cats who bond quickly and actively look for human interaction. hedgies are huffy, spikey grumpy butts and it can take months or even over a year to bond with and some hedgies never really warm up to their humans."
Hedgehog,ff5q5ry,t3_eropi7,1579605675.0,This is called hedgie hives and it's relatively common. Are you allergic to any other animals? Some people falsely believe that hedgehogs are hypoallergenic but they are not. Washing the affected area thoroughly should help. I would also recommend changing whatever clothing came in contact with the hoglet. If you have a continued reaction you can take benedryl or something similar.
Hedgehog,ff48wrv,t3_erk5fo,1579558106.0,"With that many hogs you probably would need daily cage cleaning to keep the smell down. You can try putting a few open containers of baking soda around the room, that should help absorb at least some of the smell. I clean daphne's cage every other day and it still starts to smell sometimes. Fish ingredients in food can make their poops smellier so getting a food without any fish should help too."
muacjdiscussion,ff3mdww,t3_er6j9t,1579544142.0,"My mother and I were never close, I've been no contact with her for 10 years. What I do remember is that she used a covergirl eyeshadow trio that was a dark brown, medium brown, and shimmery cream color. It was actually the first eyeshadow I ever used. She would put the medium brown all over her lid and into the crease, the shimmery cream color on her brow bone and use the dark brown on her lashline. Mascara, foundation, and powder too. She had a big caboodles makeup case filed with stuff but the covergirl trio is the only thing I ever saw her use. She was very into skincare tho and used a lot of clinique. I still remember her hoarding all the samples she would get and would refuse to use them."
Hedgehog,ff3ftp9,t3_erfr20,1579540177.0,I believe revolution would be the appropriate medicine but you need to consult a vet to know mhow much and how often to use it. Revolution is used regularly to treat hedgies for mites but it also works on fleas. Please do not dose your pet with medicine without consulting your vet first.
Hedgehog,ff3f6uq,t3_ereavt,1579539824.0,You could use a regular lamp but I would recommend putting a white light bulb in instead of one that gives off a yellowish light. The white light closer mimics natural daylight. Hook up the lamp to a Christmas light timer and it will take care of itself. Keep the same amount of light all year since it's possible that a decrease in light exposure could trigger a hibernation attempt.
