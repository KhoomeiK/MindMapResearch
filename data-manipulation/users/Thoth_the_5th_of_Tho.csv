Your in a minority to say the least. But at least in the US being a dissident isn't lethal.

>  I don't see Cuba leading genocides in the middle east, orchestrating slave trades in North Africa, propping up Islamo-Fascist dictator ships such as the Saudi Arabian royal family, creating conditions for terror groups to thrive, so on and so forth. 

That's because their slave ring is right at home in south america and they are the terrorist dictatorship. 

> While America has more people in prison than the soviet gulags ever have, 

Nonsense. Based on soviet border policies, the entire nation was a prion.

> I can tell you for a fact that a lot of what you hear about these countries simply isn't true. Stalin died with 900 dollars in his personal bank account. Never owned his own home. Never earned a high wage despite being in a position of power. Can the same be said for any American government official, let alone a president? 

Stalin lived in a palace and owned the nation, including everyone within it. 

As for US presidents not earning a high wage, absolutely. Jimmy Carter is still alive.

>  The soviet union, while not true socialism, had a lot of technological advancements. The first cellular telephone was invented in the soviet union. 

Sorry, they were beaten by Bell Labs (today AT&T) by multiple years. 

>  Many of our technological advancements, if not the vast majority, are funded through tax payer dollars 

Over 60% of R&D spending is by corporations.

The internet as in the way for mainframe computers to share processing power was developed by the government. The internet we are on today was not.

The US has average costs of living an extremely high wages, this is purely a function of paranoia and spending habits.

Funny, the average indian immigrant ends up making 100k a year in the US, up from bellow 10k in india.

> You will likely never ascend to the owner class 

55% of americans own stock. Even more have 401ks. 

Most americans retire as owners. Do you not know how retirements work? You buy ownership of corporations (aka stock) and live on that. 

> 22 people own more wealth than the poorest 4 billion people on the planet. 

Your richer than the bottom 3 billion.

You have a greater net cash reserve than the US government.

Its all pointless statistics. Most people and most governments have a net negative wealth.

>  The notion that capitalism solves poverty is also asinine, being that poverty is a direct result and fundamental aspect of the capitalist mode of production.  

Its unarguable statistics.

> We produce enough to make sure everybody is fed, clothed, and housed, however, the distribution of these goods is intentionally withheld, creating artificial scarcity and endless human suffering so that those at the top can have more money. 

You realize virtually everyone who lacks food and housing today is living in a conflict zone where it is impossible to get them any?

> Furthermore, if you remove China-- which poses its self as a communist state, though it's arguable, from the equation, global poverty has gotten worse.  

No it hasn't.

>  If what you're saying is true, we'd have had almost no advancements prior to the advent of european capitalism. 

We didn't.

u_Thoth_the_5th_of_Tho,ffkfquy,t3_eu2zyr,1580022029.0,"The year is 1956, in the desert north of Las Vegas, a spaceship powered by nuclear bombs takes off and changes the world. Lifting 300 tons of cargo to low earth orbit, it has lifted more material into space than every previous mission of both the US and the soviet union combined. But its tiny compared to what they have on the drawing boards. A new front in the cold war has opened.

Not to be left behind, the soviets manage to launch their first nuclear pulse ship in 1958 in Kazakhstan.

In the following years the frequency and scale of launches sky-rockets as both sides vie for control of space. In the US, the three hundred ton capacity Orion 1 is replaced by the over six thousand ton capacity Godard Class heavy lift vehicles (known to their crew as ""put put ships"").

As the race between the US and the Soviets heated, other nations where dragged in to the fray, either as a part of the two superpowers programs, or to start their own.

Finally in 1974, with costs rising, the treaty of manila was signed, limiting allowed launches per year. The treaty recognized five nuclear space faring organizations (listed in order of launch capacity), Orion Launch Group, International Space Colonization Union, European Space Agency, Latin American Launch League and South Asian Space Program.

**L.A.L.A.** Year of founding, 1954. Treaty Capacity, 6,000 tons/year.

The project of a few passionate Argentine and Columbian engineers scraping together what money they could. LALA was formed while project orion was still a top secret US project.

Despite being one of the oldest space programs of it's type, LALA had sever funding issues in it's early days, pushing back their first launch to 1969. But once they first launched that all changed, the  Luis Huergo Class became a powerful symbol for unity in the region. LALA soon gained new members and quickly expanded.

**I.S.C.U.** Year of founding, 1960. Treaty Capacity, 25,000 tons/year.

The ISCU is almost exclusively a soviet venture, with only minor contributions from their puppet states.

The ISCU has the single largest launcher,  with the titanic Ganswindt Class lifting a colossal 10,000 tons to orbit in a single launch.

The ISCU has three launch sites, but in practice its only one. The Launch Site North is inaccessible in the winter and so remote it's not worth the bother most of the time. They occasionally test new classes there and that's it. Launch Site South was built in an attempt to improve relations in the troubled afghanistan region. This completely failed and the site is unusable due to ongoing violence. This leaves Launch Site Central as their only practical space port.

**O.L.G.** Year of founding, 1962. Treaty capacity, 25,000 tons/year.

The US's NASA was the first organization to launch a nuclear ship. The OLG was formed in 1962 when the programs of the US, Canada, Japan, South China and Korea were combined. Other nations, such as Cuba, joined over time.

Although they have the same nuclear launch capacity as the ISCU, in practice OLG has a larger space presence thanks to an additional 5,000 tons per year of chemical rocket capacity (with the aid of a skyhook built in the late 60s) and limited in space manufacturing.

**E.S.A.** Year of founding, 1967. Treaty capacity, 12,000 tons/year.

Formed by the UK and France, the ESA is the most commercially oriented of the nuclear space programs, with them renting entire ships to corporations. To suit the needs of their customers, they use smaller, 2,000 ton capacity ships. 

**S.A.S.P.** Year of founding, 1971. Treaty Capacity, 6,000 tons/year.

The newest nuclear space program and the only to be run by a single nation. SASP has not yet launched a ship, but with both their controversial launch site and ship under construction and due for completion in the next year, they were included."

Is Maxwell a posthuman amalgamation of various super-tech enhancements resulting in a ""brain-in-a-jar"" anatomy? Details are great to help us get attached to your character.

He is seeking to explore new frontiers like explorers of the distant past and gain recognition.

With the state of the world, that is completely impossible. 

As for what makes Akker a good candidate, it’s not. The AI is was given an impossible task and eventually resorted to self deception.

The sheer size of the human population at the time is central to the story, so I felt I needed to get that dealt with early.

The US's handling of China after ww2 was the biggest foreign policy blunder they ever made (and that is saying something), leading to the death of 60+ million and the cold war as we know it.

The US basically abandoned the Republic of China as they demobilized after ww2, while Stalin was dumping massive resources into Mao's army. Turning them from an almost defeated guerilla army in the north, to one armed to the teeth with the latest russian tanks and rifles.

This loss directly led to the Korean and Vietnam war and massively emboldened the USSR across the world.

If the ROC held onto China one of the USSR's main advantages in the early to mid cold war, superiority in conventional forces in Europe, would evaporate as they are forced to allocate resources to defend their massive border with china and the tens of millions of troops they could easily draft.

IMO, if they US continued to supply the ROC after the war the cold war would never have gotten so bad. With the anti communist forces having such an overwhelming advantage they would have been forced to pursue a more peaceful coexistence, rather than constant threats of war and hoping to become the new world leaders."

Those Belgian sweatshops are infamous...

Generally speaking, poor nations lack the industrialization and stability needed to trade efficiently. So unless there is no option but to trade with them (ie they have rare earth metals nobody else has) they get avoided.

Risks and costs are high. Chances are they don't have a good education system, so you will need to send people over to manage things, those people don't want to live there, so they demand a fortune. Add in other costs, like bad roads, unreliable trains, bad sewer systems and poor housing that you will need to deal with. And that's not even counting the big risks, like conflict and corruption. Nobody wants to pay out all their profits in bribes or have their factory suddenly nationalized or have to deal with a warlord taking your engineers hostage.

If you look at trade in africa for example, the higher a state ranks in democracy, (lack of) corruption and economic freedom the more it trades with developed nations."

Group-think and peer pressure is insanely powerful. No one is immune. If literally everyone says X, you will almost always end up believing X as well. There has to be at least some disent to make your brain even think to question something like that.

That is why authoritarian regimes are so hell bent on controlling speech. If you control the narrative you can make people accept almost anything, from poor living conditions to oppressive laws. If you let other people go out there and spread a conflicting message people will actually have to think about who and what to believe and that rarely turns out in the favor of communists.

Basically they are worried that lefitsist who are not full blown comunist will make radicalizing minority groups more difficult by exposing them to multiple viewpoints and forcing them to think about which one they believe in."
