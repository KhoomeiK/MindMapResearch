AskAstrologers,ffxzyi6,t3_etbuia,1580335782.0,"Interesting chart, sorry if I'm 5 days late to offer any insight. I see a couple of patterns which could indicate bpd tendencies, as well as a few ways of resolving it. Although personally I do not see it as an overly strong version in this chart.

The immediate tell to me is the 'Bucket' formation with retrograde Pluto rising as the handle. The handle of a bucket pattern always 'receives' energy from the rest of the planets, and as most of them do not aspect it, the energy is undifferentiated. The two actual aspect to it are from the inner planets, Venus (which trines it very nicely from Pisces) and an opposition from Mercury on the descendant. This opposition is the crux of the oppositional pattern imo, even though Mercury is pretty well aspected overall otherwise. It is a fuse to explosive behavior, which, being in the 7th, is always lit by others. Well, that's kinda the bpd M.O. though, isn't it. 

Another aspect which I would include, although others might find it controversial, would be the inconjunct your 6th House Moon makes to that rising Pluto. In this case, I think you dwell too much on the implied inner violence of Pluto. Are you actually diagnosed? 

Your Taurus Sun does not receive any stressful aspects other than a quite wide, almost harmless square from Saturn.  

Sun is inner-sextiled by both Mars in Pisces and Jupiter in Cancer; Mars trines Jupiter, overall a very energetic and upbeat configuration. You need to be physically active and involved in some regular physical activity such as sport or running for these energies to properly channel. You'll find the impulse to lash out should be lessened if you do this.

Imo, the bpd behavior (and I don't know if this is a professional diagnosis or your own private one) should be lessening with maturity (hello Saturn return)."
astrologyreadings,ffxc1ud,t3_evnl9t,1580322070.0,"You have 2 different squares that jump out, plus a trine which possibly enables the bad-decision making.

Your just-risen Moon, which when conjunct the Ascendant can make one prone to emotionality and impulsive decisions- although in Taurus, that is all blunted......your Moon squares your Mercury, indicating a fundamental lack of common sense and clear judgment. Your emotions and intellect conflict. Your Mercury being in the House of career will therefore influence your career life as well.

This is accented both by your Pisces Sun conjunct Mars, which adds impetuosity and even foolhardy behavior. Then thrown in a 7th House (relationships, others) Pluto square that Sun/Mars conjunction and you are prone to hook up with some nasty types.

The trine from your Capricorn Jupiter to your 12th House Moon indicates you're drawn to rough characters, and somehow feel you'll be shielded by your good nature from their bad character. Which doesn't quite work."

 The big Saturn/Pluto conjunction is in your 5th, which would involve child(ren). They make no major aspects, but their influence is still very grave, karmic, harsh, final.

  Neptune is in your 7th, which would seem to totally typify your dilemma, even if it only makes a square to your 4th House Uranus. 7th House is not only relationships and marriage, it's the House of where they go south, i.e. divorce. Neptune there would be (him) very prone to dissimulating, creating smoke screens, illusory impressions, etc.

 Your Mercury/Mars opposition that /u/AstralCore mentions is very significant. It is well supported by the cradle aspect made via Uranus and Venus (trines and sextiles), but uncharacteristically, your late degree air-sign Mercury squares your early degree Libra Moon (also in air) thus the constant flux and difficulty making choices.

That doesn't really compute, does it? 

Your chart has a massive opposition from your Cancer Moon/Venus to Capricorn Saturn/Uranus indicating extreme emotional neediness, yet oppositional defiance. And the depression. The square your 7th House Mars makes to your Taurus Sun accentuates the friction in any relationship you'll have. And you've got yet another conflicting aspect. So you constantly ask yourself ""Is this as good as it gets."" 

A synastry chart won't be anything but a distraction. Your issues are your issues for you to solve. Your issues are your issues.

If you're in a relationship that's survived, there's something to be said for both of you working through some of the issues you'd both have. That is a lot of what relationships are supposed to do- make us face the harsh truths about ourselves along with the happy times.

Partly because of that (unstable) T-square versus your Capricorn Sun's ruler Saturn trine your Mercury (this is a stable aspect), and to a lesser degree, your Sun; you feel torn back and forth.

My recommendation is always to seek inner quiet via meditation and some solitude- which should come naturally to your 12th House Sun.....but, again that probably brings you into some scary mental and emotional scenarios.

Your chart shows a built-in inner angst from Day 1 with that powerful Fixed Sign Sun/Moon square. Yet that same Moon exalts in Taurus, and sits at its NorthNode. So a bit of both, I'd think.

Its 7th House position is relevant because it magnifies the other 7th House focus of your Sun, Mercury and Pluto. So you are very much a relationship and 'otheristic' personality. In your wish world, you are looking for an ideal person to complete you; a Guru even.

You're a Full Taurus Moon baby, which is very informative, because this increases both the inner stress of self-awareness and self-mirroring....probably to the point where it debilitated your ability to just socialize without constraint. But, this forces you away from trivialities as well as trivial relationships. You are a truth seeker, and probably don't even know where to begin. Your Moon, which can be called the 'inner child', is under assault figuratively, as it is opposed not only by your Sun, but Mercury and Pluto as well. So you often feel emotionally stripped, frazzled just by this inner construct. 

Plus your Full Moon and Sun exactly square your lunar Nodes, which I wouldn't say is easy or hard...just interesting....I think it implies the key for all Full Moon types, and that is the necessity for balance. Your 7th House preponderance also hints at this, imo. Finding balance within turns your outer life into balanced productivity as well.

 The saving grace here is that the Moon exalts in Taurus, which provides a near endless supply of resilience. Kind of a paradox. Just take as many inner time-outs as you need to recharge, and you'll be good to go. 

Your 9th House accentuates the spiritual seeker role, and puts more urgency into it as well. To be serious in this respect- and you do consider yourself a serious person; one must accept the long periods of loneliness and pain that go with this Path."

> I feel like I’m not a happy person. I don’t really recall much reassurance in life, I’ve always felt (even as a child) that something is wrong with me and I’ll never be good enough, but trying to figure it out on my own has basically felt like I’m running around in circles getting absolutely nowhere. I don’t know what my soul’s true nature is.

I get this from your chart. Your 3rd House Mars is brutalizing your self-image and even mocks your own sensitivity. And it's not just a single aspect, it's the entire tenor of the chart, so don't go blaming Mars. 

 What I'm trying to tell you though, is that your feeling dysfunctional and not good enough is a good thing. Bear with me here, please. Not everyone has the spiritual sensitivity you have; I may have mentioned this. 

We are told by everyone ""out there in the world"", parents & teachers included, that we need to get fulfillment ""out there in the world"", do this, become that, feel this way. Well, there's some good reason for this, but ultimately a person in touch with their Soul is going to feel at some point the way you've felt your entire life. It's not good enough, and it's going to end all too soon.

This angsty dysfunctional feeling is you trying to force yourself to reconnect with You. It's not an easy thing, but it's the only game in Town. It's serious stuff, and it's trying to make you take your life seriously. It takes an entire lifetime and more to get centered, but every minute you devote to getting quiet in the Stillness pays back immense inner dividends. Meditate. Become your own best friend."

Okay, fair enough. Typically, but not always, stressful aspects involving the 4th and 10th Houses (which you have) indicate dysfunctional upbringing, i.e. the parents and home life.
