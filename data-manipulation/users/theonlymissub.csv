AskWomen,ffi5rml,t3_etn8am,1579965823.0,"I think it’s because I’m both loud and can be serious at times that it makes them a little scared of you. I didn’t mind it at first because I didn’t want to be bullied again but then I noticed it just kept happening. Of course I had changed over the years but it didn’t change. 

It got to the point where I think guys were too scared to approach me as well. I’m just glad that my Dom doesn’t see me as intimidating at all and I appreciate him for that."
