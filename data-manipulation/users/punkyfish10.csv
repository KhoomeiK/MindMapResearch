adorableoldpeople,fftfi4r,t1_ffs5slo,1580219059.0,I have a really good friend who often takes photos of his food and drink after an event. He doesn’t have social media. He sincerely just does it for him and it makes my heart burst with joy. I sent him this and that’s exactly what he said.
adorableoldpeople,ffs6gko,t3_euoryr,1580174313.0,"It’s funny. If this were somebody my age I’d likely be rolling my eyes. But a 70 year old dad? Adorable. I love how old people can just do things because usually, to them, it’s just about it sincerely making them happy."
datingoverthirty,ffs5nap,t1_ffqvrbs,1580173742.0,"When you get to that point, where you can see it getting serious, discuss it before it becomes too late. I enjoying mountaineering and a lot of backcountry activities whereas my partner has health concerns that stops him from being able to do such things. When we got together we had a long conversation about this, especially because my ex before him was one of my alpine partners and, statistically, more men than women tend toward these activities. 

I am fine with him not joining me on my trips, but he needed to be okay with this as well. I don’t mind if he sleeps in until a reasonable time on Saturdays while I get up at 4. The same, I need to be okay that he spends Friday evening unwinding with beer and friends while I go home and sleep."
datingoverthirty,ffs24er,t1_ffrd0dn,1580171264.0,"I had an abusive ex when I was younger. When dating since then I still didn’t call him an asshole. Having such responses about an ex, to me, not only demonstrates that you’re the issue, but also that you’re likely not over said ex."
caloriecount,ffs0ymj,t1_ffrmzkh,1580170480.0,"I second LoseIt. I go between the UK and USA and have found it to be reliable for both. That said, I also find the UI much more friendly than MFP (personal preference)."

dogswithjobs,ffnxvk0,t1_ffnhfnu,1580072142.0,Thank you. I am so sorry that tour depression has been rough this winter. I can definitely relate. I hope that it gets better for you and am glad you at least have a special fur friend to help. They really are quite spectacular.

dogswithjobs,ffljv0q,t1_ffki0v3,1580040475.0,My cat does that as well. I lost my father last year and random things will trigger me and I’ll start breaking down. If she hears me she’ll come thumping down the hall and climb up to me to comfort me. I swear she’s my saving grace.

bridezillas,ffhlcae,t1_ffh7zk3,1579940690.0,"Love this. Again, I’ve said this. Bridezilla has somehow come to mean anything somebody doesn’t like."
bridezillas,ffhl8r6,t1_ffgx60u,1579940545.0,"Yeah. Me too. Youngest. Female. Patriarchy. Do you know who is NOT responsible for these issues? My brother. She’s punishing the wrong person and that’s why she’s the AH. When you’re 5 and you lash out because you are not appreciated. Fine. But when you’re an adult, you should know that the misfortune is not yours alone. Your sibling is also affected because there is an imbalance that affects both children. That’s what make her the AH. She’s not grown up enough to realize her brother isn’t the enemy."

survivinginfidelity,ffe4v5k,t3_eswc72,1579836752.0,"I grew up with a single father and it was WAY better than him staying with my mother who was abusive and really, in no way, loved me. The nuclear family has changed as the norm and that is okay. Think about what your daughter is learning seeing a guy treat you poorly? We learn what we live: live in strength. You CAN do this. You're more than this relationship. Even if you end up alone, you'll still end up better. I agree with seeking out therapy."
AmItheAsshole,ffc77ko,t1_ffc2il2,1579793131.0,"I think you are not understanding this. You just told us she dropped out. By trying to make her change her hair colour you did bully her, whether you realise it or not. I think you need to do some deep introspection.   


I don't have red hair but I could see it being absolutely lovely with your wedding colours."
1500isplenty,ffa7em1,t1_ff9jkhn,1579729332.0,"Yeah. I can get a lot out of healthy southwestern style foods so I’ll make something like this (minus the bacon), add avocado, beans, etc. 

In most of these styles I add lime juice with cayenne for flavor."

catbellies,ff86n76,t1_ff7vwn4,1579667484.0,You’re an incredible person and you gave her love while she was here. I am so sorry that she did not make it. My little girls and my heart go out to you all tonight. Thank you for the incredible chance you gave her.

weddingshaming,ff4x69p,t1_fesb7nk,1579574585.0,"My best friend actually suggested that I bring my cat to her and her husbands wedding. That said, her wedding was outdoors and the whole weekend was at a summer camp style retreat. We’ve been best friends since we were teens who were obsessed with our pets and her dog was going to be there. My cat is ridiculously well behaved and goes to a lot of places with me. She travels with me in the continental USA. Of course I would NEVER expect to bring my cat to another wedding besides my own."
bridezillas,ff4ss9q,t3_erkqjx,1579571579.0,"This is a real bridezilla. I feel like this sub has become just bride bashing for every little thing that upsets somebody. This, however, should truly be shamed."

survivinginfidelity,fep3uoy,t1_fep1nuh,1579311534.0,I have to agree with you. If what OP said is all they got from the book then they didn’t understand the book.
SweatyPalms,fenihws,t3_eptu1o,1579285413.0,I love Via Ferratas.
survivinginfidelity,fen7sfm,t3_eprz1f,1579278843.0,"People cheat for various reasons and I think, humanely, there are degrees to how horrible WS is. But that sub glorifies cheating which is a whole different level of sadness. There’s a lack of maturity in them. A lot of them seem to have dead bedrooms but instead of opening up the marriage, etc they live off the thrill of cheating."
datingoverthirty,felywzl,t1_feldz90,1579234522.0,"All of this. People can ask for financial reasons ( not saying this is okay. Just highlighting that it can come up in different ways from just a predatory way) and the best option, if you live alone, is to casually mention that people might wonder if there are loud sawing noises at your place late at night. I mean, if you think you may be talking to/on a date with a killer, I assume this isn’t clue #1"
datingoverthirty,felyhsr,t3_eps5jy,1579234189.0,"Asking about living arrangements is actually fairly normal when trying to get to know somebody. Of course, that doesn’t mean you should have answer if you don’t feel comfortable. 

I don’t live alone so I’m very open to say that my male roommate and his dog are a few of my best friends and we hang in the same group. But if you do live alone you don’t want to come off as standoffish. Certain responses probably do tell the person you live alone. If you’re still getting to know somebody I think it’s perfectly alright to white lie this. If you get serious I would hope he would understand your concern. 

Other option is to admit that you live alone but are close with your neighbors. You can do this casually too, ‘but the smiths next door are like family! I hang with their 8 year old and they always make sure to check on me if they think I’ve been sick’

That said, no matter your situation, I truly think it helps you to know your neighbors. It saved my life when I lived alone ( not from a predator just good neighbors)."
datingoverthirty,felvxuw,t1_fekouxb,1579232283.0,It’s also one of the easiest things to find out. We’re talking about dating. He’s clearly not looking for anything long term if he’s lying. Just think about that and proceed how you wish.
blackcats,feli7yl,t1_felfaz2,1579222786.0,"We say thank you. The photo of her do not do her justice, not just in beauty but her fiercely loving personality.   


She doesn't scratch but she does have a certain baldness, if you have suggestions?   


We are glad she can bring back happy memories. That's all we hope for with her: to bring happiness on this world (don't worry, she gets paid a generous diet and is spoilt with adventures and cuddles)."

cuteguyswithcats,fe64spf,t3_enrjrn,1578881787.0,Omg. Her asking for pets is far too precious. I’m in tears as my little girl is purring in my arms.
weddingplanning,fe5st3a,t3_eni89n,1578874164.0,"If she cannot see the difference with alcohol and cocaine, you may want to consider just not inviting her. If people ask just keep it simple. 

I live in Colorado and a few friends had to send out notices to out of state guests. Even for marijuana, just because it’s legal in the state, it doesn’t mean it’s accepted 1) at the wedding and 2) at the venue. It’s pretty ridiculous that she’s making such a big deal about this. I don’t think her relationship with cocaine is healthy in the least if she can’t put it down for one night."
Zoomies,fe5qtij,t3_enlp7a,1578873198.0,I love watching happy cats just doing their happy thing in the garden. I will sit there and drink my morning tea and watch my girl greet the morning when she doesn't think I am looking.
survivinginfidelity,fe46pzw,t3_enpp9u,1578856278.0,"That show is horrible if you break it down. Every main character ridiculously toxic, Carrie Bradshaw being the most. 

We, as a society, romanticise the notion of true love which, in turn, forgives infidelity if it’s for ‘the one’ like Big. It’s horrible. The storyline of working on the relationship you’re in just doesn’t make for good stories, I guess."
AskReddit,fdzv6vq,t1_fdyxrdz,1578796567.0,My partner dismissed me supposedly for this reason. He said something to me about how he’d never be the guy for me but whoever that guy is would be lucky (we were discussing relationships in general). My heart sank when I heard it. Luckily we managed to get past it because he’s been the best partner for me so far. Nobody is out of your league and you never know what they’re looking for unless you ask.

No. This is straight up taking it out of her hands as if she were owed that bouquet. Seriously...props for having no shame, I guess."
Gary_The_Cat,fdoug0k,t3_em9z5d,1578613132.0,I keep my Mirakel in her pack for the most part too. I’m most concerned for her little butt in the snow because she’s special needs.  Those are the moments I’m most glad she has a warm house and blankets and fire to come home to.

datingoverthirty,fdki9uy,t3_elrykt,1578504390.0,It’s like being in a relationship with yourself and only you. That’s the equivalent of already having a job. Would you leave the relationship with only you for this new potential one? That’s the outlook I have and it tends to work pretty well.

worldnews,fdf5pt0,t1_fdf2ohr,1578353911.0,"While I hate Trump, I definitely appreciate this comment the most. When articles are posted, etc I wish people would discuss more of if it’s happened before, how it was resolved, etc. Being in my mid 30s I don’t know much about EXACTLY what happened then nor what Clinton did during the impeachment vote (has just moved to the USA), etc. I wish more articles shared the patterns or if it’s unprecedented.
