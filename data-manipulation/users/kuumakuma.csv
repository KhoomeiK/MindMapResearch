Although I have asian stick straight lashes that doesn’t really hold its curl, so I hope it works out for me!"
MechanicalKeyboards,fexiw64,t3_eqt3ml,1579431720.0,So adorable! Love this ;-;
Makeup,fexiq4m,t1_fexi37z,1579431641.0,"Omg yes their packaging is so cute (which is what originally drawn me to the brand) I was worried about buying it for just packaging I wanted to hear peoples thoughts on it here.

How’s the staying power of the mascara? I tear a lot throughout the day and any mascara or eyeliner typically smudges on me.

Thank you btw! I’m really debating on getting a lip balm and cloud paint."
Makeup,feeojw6,t1_fdohqab,1579037942.0,"Tried to, They only offered exchanging them for free sadly :( 
Some of the brushes are so weirdly coarse too, at least I know now not to get Morphe brushes"
Makeup,fdoh9uk,t1_fdkok4i,1578605120.0,"I didn’t really choose it. My husband got it because apparently it was one of the first things that popped up in the search engines for good make up brush sets. I never really thought about getting Morphe brushes, I typically get MAC and BH cosmetics brushes. BH is cheaper than Morphe but I never experienced something like this with their brushes. My BH brushes did wear out but after a year and a half really. 

 I’ve always wanted to try both IT and Sigma brushes though!"
Makeup,fdf2ug6,t1_fdefc3c,1578352040.0,Same! I only have a few MAC brushes (and I love them dearly) and mostly BH Cosmetics brushes and some ELF! BH is really worth looking into for brushes. Overtime of course they lose its quality but they lasted me pretty long! They also have cute affordable brush sets  :)
Makeup,fdecs9s,t1_fde4z50,1578336200.0,"Right? This was also my first time trying out their products and this was so disappointing :( 

Thank you, I hope I can get a refund. I want to spend the money else where 😅"
Makeup,fdecccq,t1_fde8mzl,1578335926.0,Trying to do either or. I LOVE MAC brushes and been wanting to try Sigma. Going to check out Cosette. I’ve always thought splurging in higher quality brushes is worth it!
Makeup,fde616c,t1_fddqh2p,1578331954.0,"I honestly prefer BH Cosmetics brush sets over these brushes. And yes I have a few Elf Brushes and they never did this as well :/
This was such a bad first experience with Morphe products. I could never really trust most sugar coated reviews about this from “beauty influencers”"
Makeup,fde5hn4,t1_fddc4xb,1578331616.0,"Yes my husband gave me the order number and receipt. :) 
He ordered them online because there’s no Morphe store near by and I’m trying to get an exchange. He’s okay with getting an exchange or refund in fact he’s just as upset about it because it’s expensive. 

I was never really interested in their brushes specifically or James Charles himself really, but my husband told me he got recommended the brush set and palette and they told him to order it at the Morphe website in Ulta (because they were sold out of the brush set in my local Ulta) 

But I really appreciated my husbands efforts and thought for getting me it!"
Makeup,fddaxyx,t1_fdd8jxw,1578303255.0,"I believe these are synthetic. It’s just upsetting for this to happen right when opening them,  when I didn’t use them yet. I thought after a wash they would return to its Shape. I’ve never had this happen with my BH cosmetic brushes which is much cheaper than this was. I’ve been researching how to get them back to shape but from the videos I’ve watched this seems to commonly happen overtime, not when you have just receive them or even after the first wash  :’-( 

But anyways, Thank you! I’ll try that. Hopefully it helps. One of them is pretty bad, it looks as though it got electrocuted tbh."
Makeup,fdd5a2z,t3_ekki16,1578295406.0,"I agree! It’s eh. 
Also my husband bought the brush set along with it and it sadly came in frizzy 😭 AND PHEW it heavily stunk of industrial paint. 
Where I’m at it’s a bit on the cooler side too and I don’t really use a heater in the room I have the brushes at. 
I tried contacting morphe regarding this but they haven’t gotten to me because of the holiday season I’m assuming? 

Right after opening them, I lightly sprayed the brushes with 70% alcohol and let it air dried. Used some a couple of times and I just gave the brush the first cleanse bath. And sadly those few brushes are frizzy. Being 100+ dollars idk how to feel about receiving some frizzy brushes. 


If anyone knows why it’s like this or how to fix this pls lmk!"
Makeup,fdd4ri9,t3_eknvlo,1578294756.0,"Aw babe, I’m sorry to hear that :(

I work at a Sephora and I genuinely try to give the best service with genuine kindness with every customer. Although, They SHOULD be making you feel welcomed even if they are having a bad day because the company really embraces inclusivity.

Although there ARE employees who look intimidating from a first impression with just the way they look with bold make up looks and such. But from personal experience, usually they’re pretty happy to help a customer and they turn out to be very kind! If you ask any questions from anyone at a Sephora I’m pretty sure they’ll be happy and willing to help you out!"
depression,fbxxsca,t1_fbxuoqe,1577203251.0,"Thank you! I appreciate your response and I have been trying to do so. I’ve been venting out any random emotions I get from it to him whenever I feel like this in a way I don’t say anything hurtful that’ll just worsen  the situation. 
The thing that just bothers me the most is how low my self esteem has become because of this.
Hopefully in time my mental health and everything will be better"
BreakUps,fbxiqhc,t3_eeskfl,1577189474.0,"This was nice to come across to! 

Good job love :) 
Hope all has been better for you and your probably deserve better anyways!"
depression,fbxiht9,t1_fbxi00v,1577189144.0,"Yes I have. He has told me how much it hurt to see me hurt so I hope it won’t happen again. I know he is a kind person which made it so unexpected. Being quite introverted I don’t  really have anyone to talk to about it, so I got desperate and posted it up here. 

Although I have been doing my best to try to be happy and continue this relationship but right now my guard is up high. It’s just that sometimes it feels like random spikes that hit my mental health."
depression,fbxh0uq,t3_eevpl6,1577187035.0,"I’ve been really depressed lately as well but this isn’t the solution. Please don’t. 

In time everything that hurts will heal, please oh god please don’t hurt yourself."
