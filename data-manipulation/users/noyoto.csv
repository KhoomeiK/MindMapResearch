He shifted the Democratic party way to the left when it comes to the presidential nominees, despite running as a Democratic socialist in a country where 'socialist' has long been a foul word. 

And now it's becoming increasingly likely that he can pull this off despite being opposed by most mainstream channels. If he can beat the other nominees, it's entirely possible that he will finally start getting some positive coverage.

If Bernie can get people out to vote who didn't used to be part of the political process, that will extend to the senate. That doesn't mean it's easy or that it's even likely, but it is possible and worth fighting for. But if you want to claim that certain social and political changes are entirely impossible, you can join a long list of people who have been wrong in the past. Including those people who found it unimaginable that Trump could win in 2016."
politics,ffrtcnv,t1_ffriq6r,1580165386.0,"That's where the revolutionary part comes in. Bernie certainly isn't naive about it. He's said many times that he can't turn the country around by himself. That the fight is not over once the people elect him. He will need a movement behind him every step of the way. That means huge protests whenever an important decision is being made, more people contacting their representatives, more progressives running to beat both Republicans and establishment Democrats, higher voter turnouts in every election. It's really key to have a politically literate and active population. 

Part of the problem is that both Republicans and Democrats didn't want to get money out of politics. If Bernie wins, that could finally change. Pass laws to prevent corruption on every level within the political process, or be replaced.
We saw how nearly all Republicans suddenly shifted to the extremely far right and we might see a similar phenomenon with Bernie and Democratic leaders.

The big *if* is whether people will actually follow through, or if all momentum will be lost as soon as Bernie is sworn in. Things can go both ways. If the people abandon Bernie, there's still some things he can do. He'll surely assemble a progressive administration and that can already be enough to be one of the best presidents in modern U.S. history, but it won't necessarily alter the long-term course of the nation.

I haven't figured out the Supreme Court thing out yet. That's one way that Trump has done some real lasting damage that could take decades to reverse."

*""I talked with several Scientologists in Minneapolis years ago and they could not accept anything I was saying, it was all about the mind. They wouldn’t discuss mental illness. I explained that cerebral palsy is effectively a TBI, traumatic brain injury. They could give a collective damn, my spirit could fix me.""*

*""During my years as a Scientologist (in the 1970's) I never saw anyone in a wheelchair in a Scientology Org. However, the concept of making the able more able is really about mental ability more than physical ability. Auditing is all about the mind. So an able person, in Scientology terms, is a sane person, one who is mentally competent. I would also say that no Scientologist would be prepared to say that it is impossible for Scientology to solve paralysis.""*

I do think protesting is extremely important. Firstly it is through protests and strikes that many of the most important rights were established. It also leads to social organizing that goes beyond the protests. It can energize and activate voters. And it ensures that people know they're not the only ones who feel strongly about something.

Just because protests don't give you what you want doesn't mean there is no effect. Do you really think America would be the same place if the protests of the last twenty years didn't happen?

Every bullshit argument they've made against the current impeachment will be a valid argument against their future attempts to impeach. When they consider the impeachment an invalid partisan attempt to overthrow the government, that's because they can envision themselves doing exactly that.

So I urge that people don't turn off their empathy for (ex) Trump supporters and give them every chance to change their mind. You don't have to agree with their vote and you can despise Trump all you want, but please don't despise everyone who voted for him.

They are indeed both populists and both are outsiders. Trump won because he managed to convince people that he is not part of the establishment. He would shake up the status quo. Bernie, as an independent senator, doesn't have the stink of the establishment on him either.

Trump has a mission and he's been highly successful at getting things done. Namely enriching himself and his buddies while using fear and hate to rally his base. Bernie can also be highly successful, only his mission is the opposite of Trump. He will attempt to empower the middle class and poor while stopping and somewhat reversing the redistribution of wealth towards the top. And he'll rally his base with ideals of justice and morality.

Bernie in many ways represents the anti-Trump and therefore it makes sense to compare them and to even see them as two sides of the same coin.

There is one big difference between the two and that is that many of Bernie's proposals already have a large amount of support among the populace. Bernie's ideals aren't as controversial among the people, but they are controversial among mainstream media pundits and mainstream politicians."
worldnews,ff3owz7,t1_ff3kvz4,1579545704.0,"Nonsense.

Soleimani isn't a terrorist anymore than U.S. officials can be called terrorists. He was a globally recognized military official and killing him was an act of war. Doesn't mean he's not a terrible person with blood on his hands, but it does mean you're not supposed to just assassinate him.

It's also ridiculous to think killing Soleimani would somehow change Iran's actions. That's like thinking that if you kill Pompeo, somehow the U.S. would abandon the strategies that Pompeo vouched for.

Next to zero consequences? Iraq demanded that U.S. troops leave the country. Iran subsequently has become even more influential in Iraq. The protests in Iran also settled down after the assassination and only came back because Iran downed a commercial aircraft filled with people. A horrific event that never would have happened if it wasn't for the strike on Soleimani.

And it's supposedly over now? Just because there's no all out war doesn't mean things have settled down. The U.S. has increased its sanctions on Iran, which guarantees more conflict. The whole situation also paves the way for a more anti-American, pro war leader to take over after the next Iranian elections.

Then we replaced it with a tiny device that can display very little information and instead of using both hands we're using just one or two fingers. It's become very inconvenient to go through large amounts of information, let alone switch between multiple tabs to compare sources. So now we've become used to processing only tiny amounts of information, ideally in meme format.

The overwhelming majority of them said Sanders won the debate. Then I looked at CNN's online coverage of the debate. There were three articles about it. From how I remember it, two of them very clearly painted Hillary as the winner and the other one was a bit more neutral, but definitely not in Bernie's favor. None of the articles felt the need to mention that Bernie scored better according to their own poll and panel audience. I also remember that days after the debate, there was research about who won the debate. The majority of interviewees said they thought Hillary won the debate, but the majority also admitted they didn't watch the debate. So long story short, people who paid attention and saw the whole thing thought Bernie won, but people who listened to the news thought Hillary won.

This is why it's so damn important to watch the debates in full. And if you don't, then stay away from all the coverage about it.

You're wrong about experimentation. Think about a homosexual guy who wonders what it's like to be with a woman and tries it out. That person does not have to be attracted to women deep down inside. That's silly. I'm sure you know that many homosexual men have slept with a woman at least once and that they don't necessarily think of it as a horrific experience.

Don't believe men can enjoy sex with other men without being gay? It happens in prison. Men who have never wanted to have sex with a man before can do so in jail and once they're out they can never have sex with men again. While there is something to be said for getting rid of labels altogether, if we go by labels in the way they're typically used, some of those prisoners who have had sex with same-sex prisoners are heterosexual.

Or let's say that I just want physical pleasure and decide to get it from a man even though I'm not sexually attracted to that man? People can pleasure themselves without being sexually attracted to themselves, so why can't they do the same with someone else?

If you have particular controversial views about sexuality, race or religion, then you know that many people could find it upsetting to find out about that after or while having sex with you. However, I guess that such people won't have sex without getting to know you first. Because it honestly is quite stupid to have sex with someone you know absolutely nothing about if you care about their views or personality.

I guess you can distinguish two common types of sex. There is sex that is purely physical, in which case you don't care about the other person's mind whatsoever. I suppose people who engage in this type of sex have an understanding with each other that it's purely physical. And then there is sex that is physical and mental, in which case you care about physical aspects and mental aspects. A third category of only caring about one's mind and not their body seems very rare when it comes to sex, especially because it's such a physical act.

So it makes sense to me that if you're going to have purely physical sex, you'd mention physical information that you expect can create an uncomfortable situation and if you have sex that's physical + mental, you'd mention both physical *and* personal information that could create an uncomfortable situation. And such personal information will probably be disclosed more organically throughout conversation beforehand.
