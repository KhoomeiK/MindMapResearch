I’m an artist too (but mine’s a hobby rather than getting money for it atm) and I know how hard that kind of stuff can get- it is _such_ a pain, especially when people get upset at you for certain things that you did (although, in my case i guess?, it’s because of my art style since I’m more towards a cartoonish look, so basically i don’t emphasize women’s breasts or a man’s Adam’s Apple- but it’s depressing either way :[ ). But drawing what you see is a thing all artists do, it’s kinda hard to see _past_ it when it’s in a picture right in front of you.

Keep doing what you’re doing though, it’s really fine- especially the focusing on certain parts of their person! That’s a good idea!! I would say maybe use a little of your imagination on it, if that makes sense? Let’s say it’s a MtF trans, in your case, so instead of the broad shoulders/chest, picture a female’s smaller shoulders and such, and for the face shape, maybe round it out a little rather than the ‘square’ look men usually have. Cuz that’s basically your way of saying that you see them as the female (or male for FtM’s) they are! And everything everyone else said are definitely good pointers too! Hope this helped a little bit and I hope everything goes well with this and future commissions!!! :3"

socialanxiety,fdsb1ji,t3_emst6p,1578698488.0,"I actually found out where mine came from cuz of my therapist. Basically I was telling her my childhood (specifically talking about my dad cuz apparently i never talked about him at all) and how my dad wasn’t really a dad (alcoholic, short-tempered with almost _anything_, emotionally abusive, etc.) and how my dad would always yell at me for talking/saying things and how he’d never listen to me. And the fact he was barely ever around cuz he was working or drinking. That’s just a summed up version of it tho. 

And my therapist was like “you know, from what you told me, it sounds like your social anxiety started when all that with your dad started happening” or something like that and it was like one of those ‘Ohh!’ moments cuz it was literally true. I used to be social and approaching others without a care (and having friends that weren’t only just my pets), but it dwindled away and was replaced with doubts and anxiety because of my dad and his treatment towards me and my siblings. Then the doubts grew to the “what if people don’t actually like me?” and “are they just pretending to be my friend?” and cuz of that i kinda lost my friends- though it didn’t seem like they cared all that much cuz they pretty much started ignoring me around the last two years of being friends. So yeah, it all started cuz of my dad, which isn’t surprising :/

They’re doing the whole “woe is me” act to make you feel like it’s your fault and it’s not. Not one bit! Honestly, if he plans to go through with his threat with throwing out your pants, hide some where only you know where it’d be and “lose” ~~throw away~~ your skirts (if you wanna be petty, which i’d totally be, they deserve it). But definitely hide some spare pants- i literally wear the same pants every time i go out because the rest are waaay too tight and/or looks too feminine to me, so if you can only hide one or two, it should be good enough! 

But this is actually emotional abuse. It’s not physical abuse, but it’s still child abuse and you should definitely get out of there! Like go to a school counselor- or maybe a trusted teacher or principal, heck maybe even a family member you can trust -and bring up what’s been happening, they could try and do something about it! You really _really_ need to get out of there man. I’m really worried for you!

Is there a way to maybe have another court hearing? And maybe have a judge that isn’t discriminatory.

I know my uncle, after about three years, is still fighting for main custody of his two boys (because their mom is toxic and a liar, for one). So, because of that, I know how pricy those can get. I wouldn’t want you to use ungodly amount of money for this stuff- unless you’re as determined as my uncle and don’t care much about the cost, then it’s up to you!
