If all the connections look good, I'm afraid I don't have any other suggestions."
ender3,ffebpwx,t3_esxayp,1579842361.0,"Mine has been running very well for several months with basically no mods at all. The only thing I printed *for* the printer was an improved parts cooling duct. That's it.

That being said, I'm going to install a hero me gen 3 with dual 5015 blowers soon. I'm also changing the hot end fan to a sunon maglev.

After that, I'll buy a new mainboard (probably skr mini e3), and later some sort of ABL with a glass bed. Then octoprint is probably the endgame for me. Maybe I'll get a capricorn tube.

I'd suggest just buying the printer at first and waiting it out. It's loud as shit though, so you might want a new board right away if you're going to be near it."

ender3,ffe6355,t3_et206f,1579837676.0,"I would suggest taking off the bottom cover of the mainboard compartment and making sure every wire has a tight connection. Especially the screw terminals from the PSU. It's possible they were never tightened down enough, and have vibrated themselves out of place.

Make sure the PSU is switched off/unplugged and give each wire (that leads to a screw terminal) a modest tug. If a wire comes out, that was probably the problem. Put it back in, then go through and tighten down every terminal in there.

Also make sure the click-in plugs are fully pushed down (though that shouldn't matter)

Check the connector coming off of your power supply for any melty / burny marks.

If none of these things work, it's probably a dead PSU. Or a BGA solder joint popped off the board. Or you had a power surge and blew something in the board."

It means that no matter who caused the accident, insurance companies don't pick a side. Even if you provide dash cam footage, or have a testimony from the fucking Pope, it doesn't matter. The victim of the crash is treated the same way as the person who caused the crash*, so insurance rates for both will go up.

Proof is only useful for police, so they know what tickets to write.

Yes, this does mean our insurance rates are ungodly expensive. My previous car cost $180 /month financed. Full coverage on that car also cost nearly $180 /month (and from what I've heard, that isn't even that bad).

*side note: the victim has the right to demand that the offending party pay their insurance deductible, up to $500. I know nothing about the details of how this works, however."
