AskMen,fevltrc,t3_eqpidy,1579398866.0,"Non-flirty will be somewhat difficult because guys can misread any sign of affection since we hardly get any outside of relationships. But I’d say compliments about having a nice smile, laugh, voice, hair/beard, or clothing are probably some less flirty ones. Body or face are probably pushing it for seeming flirtatious to some guys (depending on them and you) but would most certainly be appreciated and probably never forgotten."

AskReddit,fekt1uq,t1_fekewzr,1579207009.0,"Those aren’t proper homemade French fries. 

Properly done is take a potato (I prefer to peel it) and cut it lengthwise till it’s the right thickness. Put these in water as you’re cutting them to keep them from oxidizing. Drain them and dry them well. 

Get a pot of oil (make sure the pot is plenty deep for deep frying, or alternatively, just get a deep fryer) and bring it to 275 degrees F. Put some fries in (not so many that the oil temp drops) for about five minutes (depending on thickness). Remove them and have them draining on a wire rack while continuing to do this for all the fries. Now get the oil up to 350-375 (if going to 375 I recommend peanut oil, 350 is fine for vegetable and canola oil). Fry the fries again until they’re golden brown (or whatever color you want, about five minutes) and drain them on another wire rack. Now season with whatever you want, I personally either do salt or creole seasoning. 

They won’t be soggy when they’re done if using the oil at the proper temp (although obviously they won’t be as good the next day). They’re not undercooked because the first frying cooks them through and the second one just fry them enough to not let them burn."

AskMen,fdl8hqt,t3_elwlva,1578518840.0,One girl seemed a different but I didn’t think anything of it at the time. I’d gotten fairly in shape and she complimented me in a tank top and asked for my number (second time that had happened that semester). I assumed she was just shy and didn’t usually initiate anything like that. Come to find out she later got kicked out of on campus housing for stalking guys.
AskMen,fcvt5th,t3_ej6an5,1578009528.0,"So I might be different from most but I’m mostly shy about anything like that out of not knowing if the woman wants the same thing as me. I usually assume that any woman just wants a platonic friendship and don’t interpret any signals as attraction. If she’s very obvious (and i mean like takes her bra off under her shirt while getting in my bed obvious) about wanting me then I am not skittish and can get slightly dominant. If necessary just outright say you want to fuck. 

That being said that’s me now, three years ago I’d have been skittish and panicked slightly due to my own inexperience even if you were explicitly dtf. Getting around that requires a bit more than just saying you want to fuck. Just be patient, ease into things, and DO NOT criticize or mock or do anything to insult being bad at it. Also saying you’re alright with the persons inexperience and it doesn’t bother you helps as well. Depending on how well they take advice on how to improve it may be better to wait until after the first time, when they’re a bit more comfortable."

AskMen,fcki2r7,t3_ehm2km,1577725808.0,"So this happened a couple months ago. (Spoiler, we’re now dating)

So we started talking with the possibility of dating about three months ago. Decided not to since it’s just college and it would have to end eventually. Well we then became very close and I started confiding pretty much everything in her, which I hadn’t been doing with anyone for a while. Well we would also cuddle from time to time, and I didn’t realize how it was slowly changing me. Then one night it was like 3 am and we’d been laying together talking in the dark for about 3 hours. We were both opening up about things we don’t really tell anyone. Our lips were maybe four inches apart and suddenly I just had this urge to kiss her, it was not the normal physical desire, but much more. I just wanted to be with her in every way. I told her I wanted to, and she never said yes or no, just asked why I wanted to. We hadn’t really discussed it much in the last month, and I wasn’t that comfortable with saying how I loved her that way. But the more I thought about it while staring into her eyes the more I wanted to, and I kept having to just lay my forehead down on her arm to stop myself. We then talked and started dating two days later and I finally got to kiss her. 

I later asked and she said she probably would’ve stopped me if I had tried to kiss her that night, just to spare us both the confusion. 

If you go through my post history you’ll also see what she said after that (which was her first kiss) “I’m not as good of a kisser as my (her) brother”"

AskMen,fckghjw,t1_fckeisz,1577724799.0,"For me it’s also a matter of if my bro’s will ever meet them. When it’s someone I’m just casually with them they’ll never meet them or see them again so aren’t going to be visualizing us doing anything. With someone I care for and they meet I don’t want that to be what they’re thinking about when meeting or seeing her. It is also more intimate with someone I care about and I prefer it to be a side of me that only she knows about. So telling bro’s that I fucked someone doggy style doesn’t really matter, telling them how nice it was to just lay in each other’s arms afterwards and feel vulnerable is completely different."
