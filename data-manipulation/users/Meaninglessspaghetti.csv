I am on a meal plan that has a crazy amount of money on it (it was the cheapest one and still too much). I would say just don't buy too much junk food and only buy meals from the cafeteria, or a healthy snack like fruit. The other day I bought $13 worth of fruit in the morning and it lastest me until dinner. Now I've got eggs in front of me. Just don't fall for the sugary stuff all the time and you'll be fine."
