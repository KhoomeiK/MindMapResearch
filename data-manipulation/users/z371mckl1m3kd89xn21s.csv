There's something to be said about the efficiency of models made to sell a million units over those made to sell 1000. The companies selling a million put real effort into design. This is not to say all high end are bad and all lower end are good. But I am saying that a high end one is more *likely* to be bad than a low end one. The only thing you are paying for is the brand and better materials. But better materials are only better if they are used by a good design.

This is the common kneejerk response but surely you've learned that if freedom of speech is to mean anything it must protect unpopular speech, right? This kind of website is unpopular (in the sense of not being liked by many people but there is nothing that is illegal about the business model itself.

JusticeServed,fgifbcu,t1_fgieozx,1580819773.0,It's the opposite. The law makes up its own rules here. Posting public photos and removing them for a fee is not illegal or immoral.

JusticeServed,fgif3bb,t3_eyo31j,1580819553.0,"This is going to be an unpopular opinion but a website that posts public photos and earns money by removing that information is not doing anything criminal or immoral.

EDIT: Those downvoting because of ""extortion"" would apparently agree that a website can post ALL mugshots and NEVER take them down so long as no money is involved. This voids any arguments also based on ""the photos should not be seen in case the person is innocent"" arguement, don't protect this person from the photos. They are available anyway.

I agree the mugshot industry is ugly. But it is not illegal and shouldn't be. The problem here lies with the American justice system that makes mugshots available without a conviction. THAT is the problem here, not with the people here trying to make a website."
