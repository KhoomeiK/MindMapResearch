What you demonstrated is that workers rights and employment rate have no correlation, as the UK's are much stronger than the US but have similar rates? In fact the UK's is probably about the same as we have a much higher participation rate (higher percentage looking for work). If we continue using the US example, they also have shorter lifespan, lower happiness and less social mobility. Why would I want that for my fellow countrymen?

I'll be honest, I get by just fine - I have a decent job that pays well but I'm not the norm and for every one of me there are many more struggling. We should endeavour to lift them, not pull the rug from under them. Everyone in this country should be able to get by without working stupid hours or multiple jobs.

But the introduction of EU laws strengthened and expanded our existing laws, which makes it more nuanced than saying we already had provisions in place. Women's rights, discrimination, equal pay, part time and agency worker rights are areas like this. We had laws in place before but they weren't as robust.

An example I suppose would be equal pay - we had it in law but ours allowed for a woman with more experience and value could be paid the same as a junior employee in the same role... Meaning it was only equal pay in name but not in effect.

And for someone who wasn't around in the 60s please tell me what I should learn from it...



You don't need to monitor workers rights or consumer rights because the law has channels of escalation already. Lawyer up and sue. And better still, when people breach these laws and lawyers get involved, you're feeding back into the economy. Win win!

The government aren't injecting themselves in-between a contract between two parties - they laying down the rules of engagement. Otherwise the more powerful party has leverage (the employer). If you want an indication of how that plays out, just look at the UK negotiations with Australia and the US - we're on the back foot and they know it.

History and other nations give us a pretty good view of what happens when you have a tipped balance of power without protections. Companies will do the bare minimum for their workers to drive profit and workers are never so good they're irreplaceable.

Look at the balance of power in American 'at will' states - they're a developed nation with less regulation. Without any reason a company can fire you. Removing workers rights simply gives all the power to the employer.

If you want to make this a generational thing, I'll just point to the fact that during our time in the EU, the previous generations have had great prosperity and a much more financially stable existence.

The issue, as I stated previously, is that there's no transparency (because there can't be).

It isn't a matter of power between the members of the EU but the combined power of all member states being greater than the sum of its parts. By forming closer ties to our European neighbours we had greater leverage in trade deals. We had smoother trade with our closest trading partners. Freedom of movement allowed us to get skills in and for the economy to thrive. You can claim we have up our power but it's nonsense. Our elected government make up part of the council and have a veto on new laws and regulations. If we introduced a new law, it's because we allowed it and agreed with it. We, as constituents could vote on our MEPs to represent and our elected government decide on who is in the commission. It's not ""undemocratic"" and it's not giving up our power, it's our leaders taking our issues up the chain to find solutions that benefit us all (and sometimes pitching things that benefit us). We could still make laws, we could still control our country but we agreed with everyone else to what the bare minimum would be so our closest trade partners couldn't undercut us by abusing workers, the environment, animals...

This is just my opinion and experiences - I'm sure there are shitty companies out there but I can tell you the reasons behind some changes in my job.

Getting rid of the old hats - knowing how things are done is not the same as knowing how things should be done. Poor management and poor attitudes leads to people having the wrong skills and knowledge for a growing, changing company. Sometimes those people have to leave to move forwards and often it's painful but acts as a catalyst to change.

Documenting processes - disaster recovery and continuous improvement. Any person can get hit by a bus and not turn up tomorrow. The company is bigger than one person and if you hoard information, you slow down growth and progression and limit your own career opportunities because you become valuable exactly where you are but nowhere else. You also make it hard for others to look for improvements because the processes are in your head.

I'm not saying my experience is the norm, I'm a sample of one, but I have focused my efforts on improving things and helping others around me to succeed. That's given me a career. In every role I aim to make myself redundant - upskill those around me and enable them to do their jobs better. That means documenting processes and unfortunately it very quickly becomes clear when people aren't willing to change and grow.

Yes you need to know your stuff but soft skills are a huge part of life - the attitude you show in your comment seems to boil down to ""**** corporations and hoard knowledge"" - if that's how you operate, you won't progress as far. In a company, you're part of a larger team - one star, only looking out for themselves may sound great on paper but have a negative impact on the overall business.

Again - this is my experience in IT, may not apply to all. Also consider companies spend a fortune on recruitment and talent management - it doesn't make financial sense to churn staff. If you're not progressing as you want, sometimes you have to look at yourself."

Couldn't agree more on the politicians. The system seems to support political careers spanning entire generations.

I'm using Amazon as an example - I don't think it's a dumb argument. Yes Amazon's taxes pay for some infrastructure but they also use and abuse that infrastructure. Every company needs to pay appropriate taxes to ensure it is maintained. Companies benefit massively from an educated, healthy workforce and a strong transportation network, including public transport. Currently the workers foot the bill for education, healthcare and transportation and the corporation's get the benefit.

That high share price has been funded by the public. I'm not going to lie, I don't have answers to this. I think you should only pay tax on profits and if you're reinvesting in the business, eventually it'll pay but Amazon have had tax breaks constantly (that smaller businesses don't get) and have consistently focused on growth meaning the govt.

You could tax on the growth of his share portfolio but you'd equally have to issue rebates when it drops. It's give more regular tax income (or not if Amazon has a bad year) but I imagine the admin overhead could be a burden?

That means anyone fed by that could get a 1gbit connection but if everyone tries to hammer it at once (unlikely) you'll all drop to about 80mbit.

You can upgrade that single fibre to XGSPON which can do 10gbit in both directions. To do that, you just have to swap the equipment at your property and at their end (the bits that send and receive the light).

I think a good long-term step would be to get a pro in when you can. Just be careful with any damp company - they have a vested interest to sell you an injected damp proof course and tanking but they can damage your house in the long term. https://www.heritage-house.org/ covers a lot of it and has a load of information (though the bloke is a bit fanatical). If you do look for an expert, make sure you get someone who understands old houses. They'll probably give you a list of things to resolve and some of them you might be able to DIY.

HomeImprovement,fdeiap8,t3_ektrr5,1578339621.0,"Ok, so be careful about any advice people give you regarding tanking or fitting a vapour barrier - old houses in the UK were not built the same way as modern houses, they're literally the complete opposite. 

Where newer houses are built to keep water out using impervious materials, old houses are all about breathability. Unfortunately, a lot of people don't realise this and go and apply modern materials to old houses, causing issues like this. It's likely with the age of your house that you might not have a damp proof course, so anything designed to keep moisture out will likely just trap it in the wall.

There's some sound advice here though - first up, check that there's no leaks in the guttering, roof, missing mortar etc. outside. Assuming that's all ok, there's a few things to watch out for.

By the looks of that plaster (pinkish colour) it's modern gypsum plaster, which doesn't breath but also doesn't tolerate moisture all that well. If the wall was soaking, you'd usually see the plaster blowing off, paint flaking and it turning to powder. I can't really see that in the picture though the wall on the left does look like it's had a hard life so it could be that it's been patched and painted or the paint is holding it together. If you run a scraper over it, if the paint comes off and you have a tonne of dust behind there, the plaster is damp.

Assuming it isn't coming from outside, it could be condensation. The wall will be cold and uninsulated and the air damp and warm - it's common in old houses with sold walls. 

To get around it, there's two things to try. 

First up, ventilation: you'll create a whole load of water vapour just by breathing but you'll make it worse if you hang clothes to dry indoors. Also when you're cooking, make sure you have an extractor on that vents outside (if you don't have one that vents externally, crack a window). If your house has been modernised with double glazing, and tonnes of insulation in he loft, you need to make sure air circulates. This might mean opening trickle filters on the windows or opening windows regularly to let air circulate. If you've got old single glazed sash windows like I have, you'll find they're probably draughty enough to avoid that step. I'd even go as far as lighting the fire every now and then - it'll circulate dry air.

Second tip is about your heating - it's not nice for your bank balance or the environment but don't let the temperature drop too low. It's better to have your heating on a bit lower and constant than to have it flipping on and off, cycling between warm and cold causes the air to warm up and cool down and as it cools it can't hold as much moisture, leading to this. Nobody tells you this when you buy an old house but you do need to keep the heating on more. Try and adjust radiators so that hey stay on lower for longer rather than blasting heat for 20 mins then going off.

Side note: if it is an old house that's been insulated and double glazed, check the loft space - if too much insulation has been fitted and air can't get in from outside, you'll get condensation up there too and it'll rot your timbers!


If that alone doesn't solve your problems, you're probably going to need to look at other external factors. I'm assuming this is ground floor, if it isn't some of this won't apply.

External render is a nightmare on old houses. If someone's coated the place in cement based render, it will cause havoc as it'll just trap moisture in the walls. If it's a lime based render, you'll be ok. However if someone's put modern non breathable paint over the render, that'll have the same effect, trapping moisture.

Another thing to look out for is ground levels outside. They should be below the ground level inside the building, if they aren't, again, I'll drive moisture inside. The only solution here is to lower the ground outside or find a way to keep the moisture away from the walls. Sometimes a French drain can help.

I'll keep thinking but any more information you can give or more pictures are useful. Knowing what the other side of that wall looks like would be useful."

HomeImprovement,fcz1vpe,t1_fcyxw9c,1578091995.0,"It's a common layout in the UK, two up, two down. So there were two rooms downstairs (living room and dining room). These have been knocked through into one big room and a RSJ put in to support the floor above. Just to the left of what I've chipped out is a brick pillar where the RSJ meets the wall.

The chimney is likely directly above where the RSJ meets. Because our loft (attic) has been converted to a room, you can see the chimney breasts run parallel on the ground and first floor and then converge in our loft room. I'd expect if water was getting in, it would likely follow the path of the chimney breasts rather than fall straight down?

Like I say, the wall is actually dry, it's just very low level moisture pushing the paint off and slowly degrading the gypsum. Gypsum doesn't handle moisture whereas lime does.

In this case, it's had two treatments over the years and no resolution. Someone with experience of heritage houses pointed towards gypsum plaster and the concrete floor being the most common issues. I can only solve one of them. SPAB make note of concrete floors being an issue too.
