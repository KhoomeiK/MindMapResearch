Cruise,ffo3464,t1_ffniyk5,1580073598.0,I believe they are keeping it on with the plan of Cuba itineraries once the relations improve.
Cruise,ffmez0j,t3_eu7bpq,1580053631.0,"We just got off the majesty a week ago (Majesty's first 8 day trip).   

Negatives about the ship:

\- Not all rooms have refrigerators

\- TVs need upgrading

\- Too many smoking areas and the smoke from the Casino wafts far beyond the Casino

The positives are too numerous to list.  Majesty had better food than most cruises I've been on (and they all are pretty good).  The dinning staff was great.  The ship didn't feel crowded at all.

Yes, you can walk around on your own at any point.  It looks like you have a pretty packed schedule, though so I wouldn't over-do it.  Don't feel guilty about going back to the room, watching a cartoon, and taking a nap."
todayilearned,ffju0bm,t1_ffjtxly,1580006907.0,"Yeah- that's classically the way to do it.  And when that didn't work I tried 10 other things I found online.

EDIT: Pretty sure it was an office 365 bug that is now corrected."
todayilearned,ffjt8qr,t1_ffjmv81,1580006315.0,"Programmer as well- I recently struggled for hours trying to convince Excel that my date wasn't a date.

I consider myself advanced in Excel and I've done things in my career that people told me were impossible.  But there I was thwarted by a simple problem."

personalfinance,ffi4ueg,t1_ffi3hvm,1579965115.0,"Logically, yes.  But from my own bad habits and watching other's habits I think Op is better off keeping the debt and investing.  

A company with limited cash flow will spend more frugal regardless of their income.  I think people are the same.  Cut your cash flow, feel some pain, and you'll be better off than doing what is ""logical"".

In the real world one consolidates their debt and then adds more debt.  I would argue that after 10 years many people will have nearly the same debt they had in the past.  The money would have been better invested.  

I know this is terrible advice from a financial model, but I think it works better for humans."
personalfinance,ffhtdex,t3_etj350,1579952913.0,"Most people will tell you the logical thing which is to consolidate at a lower interest rate and pay off the debt.  However, having debt makes people feel like they can't afford things.  Feeling like you can't afford things makes it so you don't buy things.

I would keep the debt and increase your rate of savings anyway you can.

EDIT: and don't save, invest."
technology,ffhsvf5,t1_ffhrs6m,1579952174.0,Yeah- I have a universal as well.  They are like 8.00 on amazon.
iFit,fff5evq,t1_fff0xqd,1579876153.0,It looks like their service was down the past 12+ hours.  Wonder how wide spread it is.
iFit,ffdvwk2,t3_eqjgra,1579830238.0,Wondering the same thing.  Figured there would be a whole community here.
Cruise,ffdc8oa,t3_et02wa,1579817801.0,A keychain!  But I didn't really win it; I earned it.  Had to stack cups within a minute.  The keychain goes nicely with my collection of ships on a stick.
teslamotors,ff4dsza,t1_ff3vuod,1579561236.0,"Is it possible that there isn't driver feedback when the accelerator is stuck on an electric vehicle whereas there is with an ICU.   When an accelerator is stuck in an ICE vehicle the driver will hear the engine growl even if the driver also has their foot on the brake.  On an electric, it sounds like there isn't feedback, until the driver takes their foot off the brake.  This would still be driver error, but I wonder if that could play into it."
teslamotors,fezoutw,t1_fez0f3o,1579459806.0,"You are right, except the phrase: ""that possibly all instances "".  We know that floor mats can cause the issue and the ""ample evidence"" link also mentions it."
teslamotors,fezoauh,t1_fez7gkl,1579459618.0,"Had this happen in an Audi due to a floormat.  Put it in neutral, came to a stop.  Realistically, I wouldn't have even had to put it in neutral as the brakes are more powerful than the engine.

After that incident I realized the hinge on the pedal works the opposite as I had envisioned it before.  It then became clear how floormats could lead to the issue."

investing,fe6diy9,t1_fe5xlur,1578887744.0,"I’m traveling so I don’t have the numbers I ran but basically basically I compared the following...

1) investing 20$ a week over the course of 5 yrs, 10 yrs, 15 etc

2) getting a loan at a cost of $20 a week and investing all at once.

What I found is that #2 worked out better the vast majority of the time.  However to make it work virtually all the time you’d have to do a combination.  Option 3.

3) getting a loan for 5$ / week then 6 months later getting another then continuing the process until you are at 20$ per week.  This way you’d be leveraged but invested in over the course of a couple of years."
investing,fe5jtzk,t3_enr9xg,1578870374.0,I ran several simulations on this type of thing because I was thinking of setting up a fund to do this.   What I found is indeed you’d be better off 90% of the time.  The dot com bubble and 2008 being the exceptions.    If doing this I found it was always successful by both dollar cost averaging in while at the same time leveraging.
HomeImprovement,fdq3wq0,t1_fdpp8yr,1578653636.0,"I commented elsewhere, but I'll add it here.  Look closely and you can tell that 3 of those studs are most likely there to just support the drywall at the corners.  You can see that there are two rooms on the other side of the wall.

Does Op need to verify that this isn't a structural wall? Yes.  But, it's probably not.  

Most likely Op can sister a 2x4 along this and everything will be fine."
HomeImprovement,fdq3lyu,t3_emlrnz,1578653220.0,"This isn't a great job, but I think many people are over-reacting and making it seem like the sky is falling here when this might not be that big of a deal.

\#1 You don't know if this is a load bearing wall.  Figure that out first.

\#2 From the looks of it a couple of those studs are probably unnecessary and are used only as a place to secure the drywall at the end.  That's why in small spaces like bathrooms and closets you'll see many studs in a small space.  It looks like 2 of the studs are actually for this purpose for the rooms on the other side of the wall.  Should you cut them?  Probably not.  Will it cause the house to fall down? No.

\#3 I think calling your insurance agent and an attorney as people have said on here is way too premature."

engineering,fdk0ec7,t1_fdjy6my,1578492915.0,"I agree.  I could see licensing split between a few areas of expertise as it pertains to software development.

Data Collection: Data integrity focused

AskReddit,fdgncr8,t3_el4ev3,1578403049.0,I worked at a large manufacturing plant.  This is back before everyone had cell phones.  A lady called in because she wanted to talk to her husband.  We were trained to ask if it was an emergency.  She said “the garage is on fire and I’m not sure what I should do”.  After some follow up questions I told her to call 911 and get the fire department there.
personalfinance,fcxb8gp,t3_ej7uhf,1578058065.0,"If I was your boss this is what I'd want to hear:

""Good morning.  It's come to my attention that some others in the office may have received a bonus.  That is fantastic that we can afford to do that for employees.  I appreciate working for a company that rewards hard work.

As you know I didn't receive one.  I think I've done a good job here this past year, but I want you to know I'm not satisfied with good.  I'm going to do a great job in 2020.  A year from now when bonuses are discussed I want to be at the top of this list.  A month from now or anytime during the year if I'm not at the top of the list, you need to let me know why I'm not at the top of the list.  Can you do that for me?""

I'm not your boss though- so your mileage may vary.

EDIT: The great thing about Reddit is that it removes some of the survivor bias.  You really don't know if this advice has allowed me to keep working at minimum wage or if I'm the CEO of Microsoft (I'm not)."

teslamotors,fcu0txn,t1_fctyyas,1577968647.0,">The reason I say that is because it doesn't act like other stocks

It acts just like every other stock in it's position.   It's hard to judge the value because of growth and uncertainty.  On the other end of the spectrum would be a utility where there is less growth and uncertainty."
teslamotors,fcu01e3,t1_fctkjbz,1577967741.0,The defense could argue all they want that he's just an idiot living in a fantasy land.

teslamotors,fcqr6vb,t1_fcqplfq,1577890924.0,"I think the issue is with short sellers being able to say or do anything to deflate the price of the stock while the SEC says mum.  It's not the fact that they don't think Tesla is a good investment or that it's overpriced.  It's the fact that the genuineness of their arguments are easily debunked, because they lie with impunity.  

They then use words like ""cult"", ""disciples"", ""big believers"", or ""worship at the alter of musk"" as seen in this video to undermine genuine and legitimate criticism of their arguments."
