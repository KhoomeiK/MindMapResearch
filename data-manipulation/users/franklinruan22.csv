I do agree, but I believe it be to be selfish to want to feel happy and ignore others. Of course you must help yourself before helping others, but once you are happy, i believe that you must help others."
Stoicism,ff94f8h,t1_ff8kfed,1579704589.0,">The key of everything is humility - which he doesn't have - so that you can objectively assess yourself and the world and know when feedback should be heeded or ignored. But, by virtue of humility, you should never fully dismiss any feedback because you will forever assume you aren't fully humble, let alone perfect.

It's true, but you can always use the moment to practice the virtues. 

Saying the obstacle is the way doesn't mean that all problems have a way to be solved, it means that it does not matter what happens, you can always use the situation to mold your character, you can always improve your virtues.

Ex: you may not beat a chronic disease, but you can use it to practice your patience and gratitude towards all that you have, instead of thinking how awful your life is because of the disease."

* Unfollowed all subreddits related to it
* Stop seeing videos about the game 
* Deleted the game

It was hard at first, but so far, sometimes I barely remember the game even exists.
