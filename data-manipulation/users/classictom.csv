This also isn't how genetics work. Just because no one in your family expresses a certain trait, does not mean that they do not carry the genes for it. Genetics are complicated. You can ""carry"" genes for certain disorders but it never expresses itself. Possible your family members carry genes for the disorder but it never developed.
