Peterson comes onto the scene during a certain bill being passed in Canada. The bill was adding protection for discrimination of gender identity. Peterson claims that you can be arrested for for calling someone the wrong pronoun. This is false, but it doesn't matter to Peterson. He makes a big stink and reactionaries on the internet grab onto him. As a result he gets famous within the alt righ and various right wing circles. He starts making the rounds on various media outlets which starts his exposure to the rest of the populace.

So thats kind of an introduction for people who aren't familiar.

His books are largely incoherent and when he tries to use a harder science to back up his nonsense, he gets it wrong.

He likes to rant about Marxism and he has a lot of rants where he calls it evil and if you want any sort of social justice you are evil as well.

His daughter is apparently grifting people about an all meat diet and Peterson claimed had an impending sense of doom because he drank apple cider vinegar.

He also likes to do the familiar ""I hate the left and I'm an epic logic bro and nobody on the left wants to debate me"" but plenty of prominent scholars or experts have offered and he turns them down. He likes to charge outrageous fees as a way to duck debates when people offer to show up for free.

He finally agreed to debate Slavoj Zizek, a famous dumpster raccoon Marxist Scholar. Seriously look up some pics of him if you haven't, hes hilarious looking. So during the debate, its revealed that he only read Marx once, when he was younger and he only read the Communist Manifesto, and then he reread it the night before the debate. He was completely unprepared and Zizek really showed how little he knew, though Zizek was very cordial with him (Zizek has some reactionary views, hes an oddball).

OutOfTheLoop,ffh0j1y,t3_etczks,1579919852.0,"Answer: Basically Rogan endorsed Sanders and said he would vote for him in the primary and the Sanders team is using it as campaign fodder. The people in other political camps and the Democratic establishment are attacking the Sanders team because Rogan has a lot of reactionary views and problematic guests.

Rogan has platformed charlatans like Jordan Peterson and Andy Ngo.Ngo has gone on to assist Proud Boys and other psuedo militia groups in hunting down ""antifa"" or just regular DSA people. Ngo has also made it a mission to dox as many of those people as possible in addition to just being a massive grifter.

Rogan regularly platforms a vicious anti-palestinian voice in the form of Bari Weiss, someone who weaponizes her identity to attack anyone who shows the hint of sympathy toward the Palestinian people.

Rogan platforms people who espouse anti-trans views and Rogan himself has some reactionary views towards that community and the LGBT community at large.

He platforms Ben Shapiro, a profoundly stupid propagandist who also attempts to wield his identity against the majority of US Jews who identify as liberal or leftist, claiming that they are JINOs. At the most charitable he is amenable to the rising far-right/white supremacist groups. A less charitable interpretation is that he is a white supremacist himself, see his comments about ""Arabs living in sewage"". Also see the BBC interview where another reactionary far right asshole utterly destroys Shapiro and makes him rage quit.

So Rogan is a land of contrasts and has a HUGE audience. Its like the most listened/watched podcast out there. He has decent people on and he has awful people on. I don't really care for Rogan, but I appreciate that he has had Cornell West and Bernie Sanders on and exposes them to a wider audience.

So with all that being said, the people who are attacking Sanders are also supporters of other campaigns. Some of those campaigns are basically dead in the water or are losing ground to Sanders. They are grasping at anything to help their candidate.

The problem is that every single candidate aside from Biden has asked to go on Rogan and Rogan turned all of them down except like 3 of them.

The other problem is that those other candidates have the endorsements of some pretty horrible people, people who have done much worse.

Hillary Clinton supporters are ignoring her relationship with Kissinger, Weinstein, and even the stuff that Bill Clinton did.

Warren trotted out a mass endorsement including Ed Buck, a top Dem donor and someone who is was arrested after 2 young gay black men ended up dead in his house. Its almost confirmed that he lures them in and gets them addicted to drugs and ends up murdering them. Warren also just got a half endorsement from the New York Times, who platforms a bedbug named Bret Stephens among the horrible other opinion columnists. The NYT also helped with the media frenzy around Iraq and helped the NatSec community lie us into Iraq. Not to mention they downplayed Hitler's antisemitism and claimed that the politicians would be a check on Hitlers ambition and that it was no big deal.

Biden is, well, Biden and has contributed more harm to the american people than most people.

Klobuchar isn't really in the race but she earmarked around 500k to an anti gay charity that performed or encouraged conversion therapy.

As a Sanders supporter who doesn't like Rogan I think its a good idea. The reality is that this is just a political hit from people who are threatened by a surging Sanders."

It would take Fox or any of the other fascist ""news"" outlets to convince them otherwise, and thats still a 50/50 shot of them thinking Fox is a liberal media outlet.

worldnews,fd5kbxe,t1_fd51r4s,1578178462.0,">But what I had read was that he was going about it by reducing child mortality rates. Something about how, when people think their children will actually live and be healthy, they don't have as many children.

Thats the western patriarchal notion of things. He is forcing his vision of what society should look like on people who don't want or need that. What they need is a more equitable society. Western corporations are ransacking African nations and those nations are getting little to no reward for it. He is definitely trying to reduce the population growth, hell this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMo3nZHVrZ4) was sponsored by the Gates Foundation and that came out about a month ago. 

>I didn't see anything about eugenics yet, but I was reading pretty quickly between car repair stuff.

Dictating who can have children and who can't (IE the global south/Africa cannot have children) is a cornerstone of eugenics. Implicitly saying that those African nations can't make decisions for themselves. Its, uh, a very complicated part of the legacy of eugenics and early proponents of eugenics in the US were trying to limit the reproduction of the African American women in the early 1900s.

>The charter school thing I'm way too uninformed to have an opinion on. At a first quick read, it seems like he's trying to do something good, but that he may be going about it the wrong way. Could be more nefarious, I have no clue.

Any time a billionaire wants to break up unions its bad. When you also dig into it theres a big group of tech billionaires who are trying to completely alter education in the US for a number of reasons. Look at all the ""coding camps"" or other similar ventures. The tech industry is full of coders who make inflated salaries related to what they actually do, so the tech companies are determined to make sure there is a massive labor pool in the next generations so they can depress wages. 

Or the classroom and curriculum changes that are geared toward removing a large portion of the education aspect in favor of just job training. They don't want workers to think for themselves they just want workers to be trained to do whatever task the employer sets out and to never question their role in society.

And in the end, the data shows that charter schools do no better than public schools, and thats with every advantage given to them. They get to screen students and kick out low performing students, they get to ignore teachers unions, they still get public investment, and they also are allowed to turn a profit. They only exist as a way to destroy the teachers unions and for a small set of people to make some extra money off the taxpayers.

Based on his history, he isn't a brilliant person that Reddit loves to claim he is, he just got extremely lucky and capitalized on his family and proximity to Paul Allen and the other guy who got written out of the Microsoft story, and he is an evil bastard who changed society for the worst and is using his charitably foundation to rehabilitate his image. And it seems to be working."
