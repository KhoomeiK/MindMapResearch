Sometimes that happens. Sometimes they flank.

No, that is obviously not the only thing making it hard. Get off your embarrassingly elitist GAMER attitude.

&#x200B;

> Ohh but the only way to make an AI hard is to give them an unfair advantage. Well not quite.  

Life is not fair. This is a game about realism, war and surviving. Sometimes you will get shot and you have no idea why. It can be a aimbotting scav, or it could be a player sitting in a bush and you didn't notice him. I've played with people who cry ""HACKER!!!!1!"" or blame bugs when they die all the fucking time. This game has lots of random elements, as it should. If you want a competitive shooter, there are plenty out there. I got a bit off topic but my point is that this game isn't supposed to be fair. Just as in real life, you WILL die to things out of your own control. 

I'm playing this game ""slow and tactical"" and I don't have any problems with scavs. Out of 100 raids I maybe die to scavs a few times. Learn to play the game as it's supposed to be played instead of blaming it on broken AI.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Get gud."
EscapefromTarkov,fdouyqa,t1_fdos397,1578613465.0,"Not all games though. Some bosses require you to do things to beat them and once you're done, it's a oneshot more or less. For example Bed of Chaos from Dark Souls only has 1 hp. Asylum Deamon can be one shottet if you know how, same with a few others. 

&#x200B;

It's all about the design of the game. In a realistic shooter, most guns should do a one-shot headshot. Make the boss hide, move quickly around, etc. There are many options for creativity."
