Competitiveoverwatch,fftjb6l,t3_ev0c5y,1580222042.0,"I'm also of the opinion that the higher difficulty, more skillful heros should be tops in high-end play (say, Master+), but the easier, lower skill floor ceiling heros are a more viable option in lower SR. So while I actually do find Moira a lot of fun (tbh, I'm a GM Lucio main, and prefer playing Moira to Bap if I have to flex to something else), I get that she shouldn't be a dominant healer in most scenarios in that higher SR. Bap and Ana are the picks up there. Or, just Bap now, but I feel like he's still just centered around an overtooled part of his kit, which is never fun.

When Ana is the top main-heal support in high-end play, I'm perfectly fine with it. She's difficult to play, has to manage cooldowns, and is vulnerable, and really has to work with and rely on her team. With Bap there instead, it feels like he's just overtuned. Even on the PTR his healing doesn't require the precision of Ana's, his shots are easier to hit, hes got mobility, he's still got immortality, and he has a very fast charging ult (even after nerf) that he can use for himself.

Bap is more interesting to watch than Moira from a competitive OWL viewpoint. I just don't like that it's Bap or Bust, apparently."
Overwatch_Memes,ffs66nq,t3_eut5gc,1580174122.0,"I don't care about ships much at all in Overwatch (the only two I even have a passing thought on not liking are Gency and Pharamacy tbh, but there is almost no lore in Overwatch's glacial pace, so it's not worth thinking over), but I don't think Blizzard attempts to care if the VA talk about ships in any non-confirmed ways. Even Hanzo/Mccree, which is very unlikely to even be remotely hinted at in the sparse canon, gets ingame nods sometimes, aside from the developers jokingly commenting on it sometimes (as that is the most widely popular ship).   


So I don't think the devs allowing the VA to mention a ship outside of their recordings really matters at all, or gives credibility to one either."

If you try to play an off-meta hero in these diamond groups -not a throw pick, not even a *bad* pick- the team will blame *every single failure* on you. It's hysterical. In GM the players are a lot more lax. I'm assuming it's because people figure you know your role, and if you picked that hero you're probably good at them...and I guess we're also frustrated with the meta up there."

On Well, Lucio should be looking for boops. Lucio's Aura -for a flexible Lucio player- will be reaching the teammates unless they're fullstop cowering in their choke -which is a poor idea. Odd are, at least at higher SR gameplay, at least half your team will be a tiny bit pushed up and you're offering your team all the same benefits as if you were just parked back there with them. Lucio's ability to full-stop control a choke on certain maps is invaluable. It's not just about the possibility of maybe getting a boop; it's an entire teams inability to go through the main choke for fear of that enviromental, forcing them to scramble and take worse options.   


Obviously there are other situations sometimes. Maybe you've got an Ana who can't 1v1 a Tracer (not as common in higher SR, but possible), and you have to peel for her a bunch. Things like that.

I think it's a case of popular streamers finally saturating the general playerbase. Maybe you don't watch high end streamers like Seagull, but eventually those plays and strats will boil down to you."
OverwatchUniversity,fedz6lr,t3_eokd9h,1579022978.0,"I think Pharah is a moderate pick. She won't ever be an easily balanced hero because her kit is so terribly unique, and because -from a very generally speaking standpoint- a player requires a much firmer level of 'skill' to counter her than she requires to get value. (Let me add that I think Pharah is a hard hero to play! She has a lower skill floor, and moderately high skill ceiling, but to *counter* her you need to have a decent hit-scan player.) Therein will always lie the problem; at lower SR  players can get a lot more value out of Pharah -she isn't too difficult to pick up and play, she does good spam damage -which is very valuable at lower SR- and helps *keep Mercy alive*, and Mercy is also huge at lower SR. But the higher SR you go, the less often you see Mercy, and the better the players get from a technical standpoint (aim, callouts, positioning), which is Pharah's biggest counter. You get to the point where just a different strat and different use of resources will be a better fit for the team.  


It's like Torb or Bastion -for example-. They're *always* going to be strong picks at lower SR -players just don't have the coordination to deal with them, and aiming is of little consequence for them. But the higher up in SR you go, the more resources they require to work because players are just better at the game. The phenomenon of OTP aside, a *generally good player* will be able to eke more out of say Mccree's kit than Torb's at higher SR. He counters more things, and the turret -a key part of Torb's kit- isn't as valuable anymore. That's not quite that either of them are wildly unbalanced, either.   


Outside of gameplay, I suppose Pharah could use more lore. She does fairly well in terms of cosmetics -not one of the more popular ones, but gets some nice things here and there. She *has* had the comic, as you mentioned, so she's already doing better than heros like say Zen and Lucio, but it's unfortunate for Pharah fans that her character is so keenly tied in to Mercy and Ana.   


I can understand Ana -that's her mother, obviously-, and I wish they would look at that relationship from Pharah's side more often, because that's so interesting. Instead, a lot of what we know about Pharah is directly from Ana - so, to me, that's *Ana's backstory*, more than Pharah's. Her identity is based just on other heros. Mercy is especially annoying; I feel like, because Pharah and Mercy have such a symbiotic relationship gameplay-wise, their stories got a bit intertwined. That's okay, except Pharah is just a side-blip on Mercy's enormous amount of lore and backstory, but it's like almost the entirety of Pharah's...And every new character that comes out comes with more lore than a lot of the original cast. It feels bad. I understand that I guess we'll get more in OW2, but to wait \~4-5 years *just for some basic lore* is a little outrageous."
OverwatchUniversity,fedjgwy,t3_eoif8g,1579013078.0,"I guess it depends on your SR...I have multiple accounts and the higher SR you go up, the less often teams go left. In plat/diamond, it's like a 70% chance they'll go left, but in masters and GM, people very rarely go that way (in my experience, anyway). There is almost no reason to go left beyond a cheeky Sym flank (and, in GM, if you see a player going left even without seeing s Sym yet I assume it must be a Sym team), so it's just a matter of game awareness and positioning."
luciomains,feawcy2,t3_eo6q13,1578952857.0,"I've got a few support accounts...my main is GM, and I have one in plat and one in diamond (these are for queueing with different friends. My GM I mostly solo or duo with other GM friends). I'm also a Lucio main (I've got about 2500-3000 hours on him hahaa...). I find in higher SR- in GM- I get asked to swap far less. I think this is because people assume you are good at the role you've picked. Also, I feel that a lot of the playerbase in GM is super frustrated with the stagnent meta and will sort of allow odder picks sometimes...  


That being said, \~diamond are super slaves to the meta. Whatever they saw on Seagull or Jake's stream is what they need you to play. For the most part, that's Bap (for sure) and either Zen or Lucio...but at the lower SR it's way more forgiving technically...even with all that in mind, I am first and foremost trying to have fun. If I am being totally shoehorned into not having fun, I will not swap. I am playing a perfectly viable support if I am on Lucio, for example, as opposed to Moira -assuming we have a Main-Healer-. I am also obviously playing to win, but if my team us running Genji/Ash/RH/Ball or something, and asks *me* of all people to swap -which happens *all the time*, I won't swap then either. If you think I am the only person in the group who has to play the meta while you're ignoring it yourself, you've got to be kidding.   


My final, biggest gripe -which is not locked to the meta- is when the DPS or Tanks complain that there isn't enough healing with a very traditional and standard comp. That is almost ALWAYS on them, and it infuriates me that they demand even more healing."
OverwatchUniversity,fea8oeq,t3_eo51x3,1578945674.0,"Before 2-2-2 role-lock it was somewhat recommended to be able to play at least two roles, and at least two characters within that role, as a 'just in case', since queueing was random and it could be 6 support players, for example. Now you only really need to know your own role. If you like to play flex and queue for whatever, that's fine too, but if you only feel comfortable as a support you only ever need to play support.  


Having said that, I would say that if you're queueing for support, you should be at least a bit comfortable on three heros within that. Ideally, you want to be able to flex onto the 'support du-jour' (since all metas really revolve around a support pick), which right now is Baptiste. Statistically, a team without a Baptiste is far more likely to lose at the moment than one with. For example, I'm a GM support player with about 3500 hours in the game. 3000 of those hours are on Lucio, so I am obviously able to play him, but I can also very strongly flex onto Moira, Zen Brig and (begrudgingly) Bap. I'll flex Mercy if I have to (almost exclusively for bunker/Pharamercy), but I really won't play Ana if I can avoid it (I never got a feel for her CD's). So between all those, my other support and I are generally able to come to terms with something we're both comfortable with.   


If you're terrible at DPS -that's fine. You don't have to be good at it or play it. My DPS and Tank are both just Diamond level. The concept of positioning for DPS or Tank is important to know, even as a support, for callouts and map awareness, but knowledge and practical use are two very different things. It's not set in stone, but usually either MT or OH make callouts, because they're the two who are either coordinating the pushes (MT, up front), or have tabs on most of the team (friendly and enemy). Also, in Lucio's case, his extreme mobility means he really can see what everyone is up to at all times, and can quickly root out flankers, and is amp speed gives him control over pushes as well. That's why in professional plays, the Lucio player is generally the target-caller, and one of the reasons he is considered a 'main support' (but off-healer).   


And I wouldn't worry about placements and placing bronze or whatever. For a new, fresh account, the game will always be a bit stingy with SR and place you a little on the lower side...but even if you do place in bronze, it's not that bad. If you like playing, it'll be more enjoyable for you to play with people around your SR, even if that means you're bronze. Remember; they're in bronze with you. It's nothing to be ashamed of, even if you're there. Better to enjoy even-leveled competitive games than be in a higher SR you don't belong in and get a bunch of terrible games you weren't prepared for, and just lose a bunch back to back. Have fun! : )."
Overwatch_Memes,fe9l17b,t3_eo5dy4,1578938891.0,"I have a really good time in the 'While You Wait' section! I'm a support queue, but if I am solo-queueing it 'Takes a long time to find a fair and balanced game', so like...around 7-8 minutes? If I am on my alt which is for grouping with my friends, they always go DPS, so the queue really is like \~10 mins. The deathmatch specifically is a really fun way to warm up and stay warmed up between matches! (It really easy, with a 10 min queue, to lose the groove you may be in!).

AkatsukinoYona,fe522y7,t3_em53nv,1578865002.0,"I can understand the frustration; we the readers are sort of mean to be in Yona's position; she's grown tremendously as a character from the start and really evolved into this powerhouse...so it is unsettling to see her almost demure seeming again, especially right next to the man that killed her father.  


I think, especially in the most recent chapter, a lot of effort, even for AnY -which has lovely art in general- was placed into drawing Yona's eyes. They are *so expressive.* Almost all her glances are tense and askance. They're stoic. Even if, while she was young, she didn't care as much for it, Yona was raised nobility; the only child of the emperor. She understands better than all of her cadre courtly decorum and she is in a very tight situation right now. Yona knows how to fight now, she knows how to survive. This was her plan, but she needs to use a different tool in her arsenal to keep her family safe in the castle.  


I wouldn't say it's my favorite arc to come out of the series, but this is just another side of the coin of what Yona has evolved into, so it's interesting. (I also think the timing was meant to play up the shoujo aspect a bit; we just got a pretty mutual confession from H/Y, and now they're separated and Yona is placed with her 'first childhood love' again. It's all juxtaposition."

I can always tell an experienced tank player (or a smurf, or whatever) from a lower SR one solely based on aggression. And, in the lower SR -like, plat- it's almost an offence to be flamed by your teammates if you're aggro! I obviously don't mean foolhardily aggro; I mean *pushing in through chokes* and the like. They're *so passive*, even the DPS players. It's really frustrating. I think that's why Winston is never a super popular pick down there; you need to have a different, aggressive mentality to play some of the dive-ish heros, particularly Winston, and I don't think the instincts are there for lower SR.    


That being said, every once in a while there *is* a Winston (even in this unfavorable meta for him), and if they play him correctly he just decimates down there. The players literally don't know how to counter him beyond 'go Reaper'."

Or, if they do, they aren't playing him effectively.

A *really good Winston* can keep playing Winston into a team even if they're running his traditional counters (and yes, on paper, RH is considered a counter...I don't particularly think he's a very hard or effective counter, but anything that prevents his jumps and/or does a lot of damage and/or has a large health pool (of which RH has all three!) isn't great for Big Winnie...but a RH has to dedicate a lot more resources to countering a Winston than that Winston needs to use to evade him. Reaper is a strong enough counter, but it's not that difficult for a Winston to still cause bedlam in the enemy backlines before leaving, while avoiding the Reaper. Remember; if you Reaper has to sit in your backline to defend against the Winston, he's not doing his other role of (ideally) harassing enemy tanks and healers. So there are small wins to be found here and there.

Good Winstons are sort of rare and far between. I've noticed the higher in SR you go, the more prevalent they become -but still not that common (even taking meta into consideration), but even in high SR people have a very hard time dealing with him.  


But a happy medium; if you're having trouble with a Widow (specifically a Widow!) and your tanks can't or won't swap, (or maybe it doesn't make sense; maybe they're running Reaper/Mei), just swap to Lucio. He's probably the hardest Widow counter in the game lol."
Overwatch,fdkomfj,t1_fdkhdb2,1578507922.0,"On my end, I'm a support main so I pretty much automatically get a bunch, and I'm super heavy on the plays and shotcalling, so I really roll in endorsements haha. 

I feel like, 5 is so rare I'm usually just assuming they're at least nice people, and 1 is also pretty uncommon, so I assume they're toxic tilters...I don't think that was meant to be the purpose of the endorsement system, but there you go lol."
Overwatch,fdkg20y,t3_eltpwa,1578503108.0,"I get what you're saying -I like to 6 stack and my endorse will usually tank to 3 then- but it makes no different really in-game, or to me...  


I do, however, use endorsements on the enemy team to gauge the players. An endorsement level one DPS player has the stink of something on them!"
Overwatch,fdkepui,t1_fdk3bdt,1578502296.0,"I'm a support main, and the 'DPS Moira/Bap' (or any support, really) is a complaint even up in GM (Though I personally think players are a bit more polite, or at least less toxic about it, up there). Personally, I think this is part of a fundamental misunderstanding of the support role (even at that SR)...Moira, for example, gets reamed at if someone sees her use her dmg-beam during a fight, but almost every game I have someone who is genuinely unaware that Moira has a voice line for when she is out of resource. She's a *resource based healer.* She absolutely *has to do damage to heal*.   


Obviously people sometimes perhaps get too caught up in a target, or make a bad play -that's the nature of the game-, but I've *never*, in thousands of hours of playtime, seen a purely just 'DPS Player trying to get a better queue', or even just DPSing in general (before 2-2-2). Even from a logicistic standpoint, they know *they are unlikely to win* if they do that; that's not what the hero is for, you are putting your team at a disadvantage, you are more likely to lose. So at that point, it would legit be flat out throwing, and you can have a thrower in any role. You can have hammer-only Torb or pistol-only Mercy. It's throwing. It's just a vogue thing to assume that you as Genji sitting at 180hp while the Moira did one second of healing (despite likely needing to accumulate resource for a teamfight) are playing with some sort of DPS draft queuer haha.   


And on Baptiste's side; he's an overtooled monster. Bap can do damage at the exact same time as healing, and he can likely do *more* damage than whatever DPS player you have...so it's easy for a support player to get caught up in that. (Or a DPS player who genuinely is trying to play support to forget he is a support hero)."
Overwatch,fdkcq4m,t1_fdk33va,1578501106.0,"Aside from 2-2-2, I think the 'while you wait' is almost the best thing Overwatch has implemented. I'm a support, so my queues aren't generally that long (before 2-2-2, I would sometimes wait 10 mins for a 'fair and balanced match', so it's actually improved to more like 2-3 minutes), but I tend to queue with DPS buddies...the 'Deathmatch' mode lets me warm up solidly, allows me to stay warmed up between matches, practice new heros in a pretty good mock-up environment (if I pick a tank in QP for example, my MMR is so high I get decimated and can't practice even basic mechanics), and I think if you're playing in a group the Deathmatch mode is a lot of fun! My discord buddies are always having a really good time messing around with each other, even if the queue does sometimes hit 10 minutes. It keeps the morale up!  


And, on an additional note, I've been able to report hackers in the while you wait deathmatch. I have no idea *why* people would warm up their aimbot in this mode, but I've reported at least 5 or 6 *very obvious aimhackers* there, and its a lot better to flag an aim-botter more often than them ruining an extra bunch of comp games for someone."
Overwatch,fdkbwzz,t3_elt5ad,1578500619.0,"2-2-2 is the only reason this game is viable to me. I am sure it will not happen, but if for some reason they removed it I don't think I could bear to play the game anymore. I've got around 4000 hours on Overwatch as a support main. Before 2-2-2 I climbed to high-masters but *dreaded* playing because I hated the encounters in competitive, and I would play the bear minimum to avoid decay. It was super toxic and I felt that at least half the time you had people playing a role they *did not want*, and either were bad at it or were half-assing it because they didn't want it. On top of that, you had the toxic throwers who would all just swap to garbo DPS if things weren't going their way (ie, some complained about the way our Rein shattered, now we have 4 DPS.)  


In a very minuscule way, I can understand how it can impede cool and fun comps. But those comps were not wildly successful and I don't think it was worth the absolute nightmare of the arguments *every competitive game.* And, as a whole, the game (in theory...) should be much easier to balance and release new content for around a fixed 2-2-2 roster. Since forced 2-2-2, I went from almost only playing QP (so...probably like 3000 QP hours...at least...) to never once sitting in a QP game. I play around 4 hours of competitive a night now, and have one account in GM, and keep two others in masters. It's so much more fun and playable."
Competitiveoverwatch,fdk8ku8,t1_fdk31m9,1578498535.0,"I'm 100% not saying Lucio isn't viable or needs buffs. All I'm saying is that Lucio has been meta because of the utility he brings to the team -his speed boost-, but as for his individual kit and contributions (as speed boost is mostly a passive ability), it's built entirely around his ability to knockback. So people who complain about Lucio and his knockback are irritating, because it is all he is actually able to accomplish on his own merits. 

I don't find knockbacks to be that terrible an issue for Overwatch, especially since Rein got steadfast buffed. I wish there was more consistency between knockbacks (ie, a Lucio boop vs a Hammond swing)."
Competitiveoverwatch,fdk2l0c,t1_fdjftwi,1578494512.0,"The problem is that is *all Lucio has in his kit*. If they made him better, then he wouldn't have to rely on enviromentals and SW for secure kills."
AkatsukinoYona,fdk22j0,t1_fdjzerp,1578494140.0,"I think the angry people are divided between the 'Hak/Yona' fans (imo there is nothing to be angry about here; Hak/Yona was obviously endgame from the getgo, so it's just drama for drama's sake), and people who don't like the idea of Soo-Won being 'forgiven' so easily for plot purposes. Soo-Won is a lot like Griffith from Berserk (well, the PG13 version I guess...), and I think him being 'sick' and that most is forgiven and that alone is his redemption is a copout for our main trios character growth.   


A character can be well written and not be a 'good guy' to the main characters. They can be interesting on their own. A main character does not have to forgive someone to be a good character. Redemption arcs don't always mean forgiveness, or guaranteed survival.   


On my end, I don't mind if Soo-Won finds 'redemption' through death, and in some way that brings Hak and Yona together. I feel that maybe Yona does not have to 'forgive' him exactly for killing her father, but she can at least understand and come to peace with it. I think that's the only 'peaceful' way for the forgiveness, personally, without it feeling cheapened.   


On the other end, while I don't think this is the case (maybe it's darker than the current tone of the manga), I do wish that Soo-Won is interested in Zeno strictly because he is so villainous. I think that would be tremendously interesting for Soo-Won, who has done *so much* to get where he is, who has killed and made tough decisions, who has thrown away his two best friends because he feels *he deserves, and is chosen for this Kingdom*, to have this divine comedic karma that he's stricken with mortality and a fatal illness. And, were that the case, would do *anything* to stop it, just like he did to get the crown. And, to that end, since right in his power is a human who can never age, grow sick or die...I think it would be interesting.  


Having said that, I'm sure it's something a little more flowery than that. Maybe he is terminally ill (and I think that's likely); he's likely trying to set as many affairs in order before he goes, and right as many wrongs as possible. Boring, predictable, but safe story-wise."
OverwatchUniversity,fco34aq,t3_ei4leu,1577823171.0,"Zen is a hero that is well balanced on his own, but is always going to be super dependent on the meta around him. He definitely *is* a support hero; his healing is not negligible; he's an off-healer, and his utility (that is, what he provides to his team) lies in discord -which pretty greatly magnifies damage and can also 'tag' enemies to see where they're headed, and where general healthpools lie. That's valuable information!   


What you described about meta is just the way meta *works*. A hero may be a 'trash pick' because a different hero is so valuable in the dominant meta, but if that meta swings (typically due to balance changes), a different hero who was untouched may suddenly seem quite strong. This happens *every meta*. Back in the day, 'peak support' was actually Zen/Lucio, which almost sounds ludicrous as an option now. I, for one, don't think Zen needs any adjustments -and all Zen players I know in higher SR didn't think he needed adjusting either. I think good players can recognize when their hero is fine, but the *meta does not favor them*. Take Baptiste right now; he was buffed to try to break up shield meta. It didn't work; the devs had to force a shield nerf to bust that up, but Bap's buffs remained in place. That's why he is so overtuned now and is the strongest support pick, but that does not mean that Ana (for example) needs a buff. Ana is fine; *Baptiste needs the nerf*. Good players can recognize that. That isn't to say, of course, that in *every meta* you have two boats; people who *main* the soup du jour -for example, Mercy-Mains during Mercy-meta-, and people who understand that a certain hero is overtuned and will 'abuse' that hero to climb ladder with. (You saw a lot of these during Brig-meta, in my experience). Those *two* camps (Perhaps the mains more than the other) often try to defend their hero, and point the blame at anything else.   


I remember during *peak Mercy meta -*that is to say, when they *first reworked her*, even before they started nerfing her down- I would get in arguments on the daily that Mercy was not too strong, but the *rest of the supports were too weak*. Which of course is not true, and that is a very slippery slope to go down; that's where real powercreep (even more than what we currently have) is born. It's hard to recover from that.   


Anyway, to sum up; I don't think Zen needs any changes. I think that next balance round will almost certainly include Hanzo and Baptiste changes at the very least; Jeff has confirmed the Hanzo changes (I would assume some sort of damage reduction, whether that be through slower projectiles or one less storm arrow, or what), and Bap's numbers will prove he needs a nerf also (which makes sense; like I said, he was buffed to deal with shields, but it didn't work and they were changed anyway, and he was never toned back). I would anticipate Bap will get a damage reduction on his gun, and maybe likely a smaller ammo capacity (when you look at it, his capacity is insane), and even possibly a tweak to immortality, seeing as that is what people gripe about the most. These changes alone I think will make everything feel *a lot better* to everyone except Hanzo and Baptiste players, I guess. We'll see even more variety in the support lineup then. (Though, at the moment, in higher SR it's shaking down to Bap/Zen or Lucio dependent on the situation anyway)."
