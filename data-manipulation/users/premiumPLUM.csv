If you had finished your biology degree and become a scientist but you didn't take any courses in ethics, then society might not be better off because you might become an unethical scientist.  For example, many of the brokers working on Wall Street that directly contributed to the Housing Crisis and subsequent Great Recession were graduates of Ivy League university finance programs that didn't require ethics courses.  Many people who have studied the collapse attribute this to being one of the reasons unethical business practices were able to flourish, and now virtually all universities have adopted required business ethics courses.

You didn't even have a conversation about it first?"

TrueFilm,fcymx9d,t1_fcxnqll,1578083025.0,"> For instance: if you're doing a World War II movie and you tell a fact where Jimmy Stewart was there, I might be open to the idea of resurrecting him with CGI. I do not think it is very elegant, but it would be conceptually acceptable for something like this.

I don't even see what the difference between this and something like the scenes in which Forrest Gump interacts with historical figures.  Like when he's on the Dick Cavett Show with John Lennon.  Like everyone else in the thread, I wonder about the ethics of ""resurrecting"" an actor and specifically promoting the film as if it were them.  But using CGI to digitally alter the appearance of an actor to better resemble a historical figure doesn't seem much worst than utilizing an especially talented makeup artist."
