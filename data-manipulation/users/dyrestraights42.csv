offmychest,ff56eoj,t1_ff56amm,1579581544.0,True true.
offmychest,ff56dky,t1_ff564r4,1579581517.0,"Ahah thankyou for making me laugh, this is honestly great advice i really needed this. Yeah, it’s all just one foot after the other"
offmychest,ff566gp,t1_ff55oex,1579581353.0,Thats the plan. Off the grid.
offmychest,ff55h6c,t1_ff55bxe,1579580782.0,"Well they are in jail now. Luckily. 
But no that didnt work either."
offmychest,ff554y4,t1_ff55036,1579580511.0,"I never made them feel wanted in the first place. They are possibly bipolar definitely psychopathic. 
Just completely delusional"
offmychest,ff551h7,t1_ff54t3y,1579580434.0,"Yeaaaah thats funny, but would never work with this one."
offmychest,ff54wic,t1_ff54m5m,1579580324.0,"Sometimes i feel like the past and all the shit i went through and all that pain and fear make it impossible to keep going. I went through depression and anxiety, i still have some of it, i locked myself away from people and barely trusted anyone. Im trying to rebuild now and those little goals are my life line."
offmychest,ff54koc,t1_ff542bz,1579580055.0,"Also did that. Lady i file with was great, stalker backed off for a little while and got scared, but shit would still happen. This was more recent to the time of their arrest and things kinda died down the past few months thanks to her. But still terrified they will get out and start again."
offmychest,ff54ecn,t1_ff53v5o,1579579914.0,"Thats true and really helpful, thankyou. 

“Your still going to be annoyed or frustrated because you feel behind but keep in mind the old school idea of graduating and having a career at 25 is not really the norm anymore. Just focus on your goals and what you want out of life.”

That especially really helps, i never thought of it that way."
offmychest,ff53z01,t1_ff53q7v,1579579582.0,"Awful. 
Yea i have pepperspray and knifes and pretty much everything else. (It’s bumpkin country) but a gun doesn’t do much when it’s locked in a safe."
offmychest,ff53n4m,t1_ff539fn,1579579325.0,"Yes hence the fight with the cops. 
Not being allowed to come fifty yards near you doesnt mean jack shit when they slink around your place like a predator and dont get caught. No money for cameras. Farm house with lots of acreage and places to hide. My only consolation is i think the coyotes chased them one time"
offmychest,ff534w7,t3_erou7i,1579578936.0,"Im not a shrink but it sounds like some kind of self dysphoria or dissociation? Might want to talk to a shrink tho, i did and it helped a lot. ,best wishes bro."
offmychest,ff336wz,t3_erczsf,1579532498.0,"Wow. Just wow. She sounds terrible. You deserve way freaking better. Cut that toxic shit outta your life. 
Best of luck. She’ll probably do a guilt trip thing to “get you back” or make people less mad at her. 
Something my mom would do. 
Honestly good luck."
offmychest,fefigmc,t3_eom5x5,1579056999.0,"Honestly?? Report him. Send an anonymous tip. Something. 
If he did it to you, he will do it again."
offmychest,feej8dz,t3_eoq7ec,1579034858.0,Congrats!!!
offmychest,fe3g35k,t1_fe0mxgw,1578848966.0,"This makes me very happy to hear that i could help in anyway, and share my own personal thoughts and experiences on the matter, im extremely proud that you are going to continue reaching out to people. 
As for your past experiences with trying to tell people, im a bit familiar with that narrative, i think some people (not all thank goodness) have a very “face value” concept of happiness, they think “what you see is what you get” and they dont care to look much farther. I had a couple friends that i would try to talk to but they would move the subject back to themselves, because they think “oh they are supposed to be the happy one, they will be fine, lets get back to talking about me” 
This is obviously toxic, and extremely hurtful. Luckily i still kept trying, i have friends and people who i dont have to smile with, one in particular will call me out on it if she sees me faking it, and will proceed to ask “quiet reading day? Or lets hang out and talk” and we sit in companionable silence reading together or we vent about whats going on. No smiles, no fake conversations, just honesty. Im in a much better place and able to reveal my feelings more than ever thanks to leaving behind toxic relationships and finding people i dont just give my emotions to, but who recognize mine no matter what is on my face, and call me out for it. I will continue to try my best to be a great friend for them as well.
And more than anything i wish this for you as well, @anxietyqueen101
Friend, significant other, family, 
You will find someone you dont have to smile for, and they will love you regardless."
offmychest,fe0eyk3,t3_enk2n8,1578812226.0,"I think it was Robin Williams who said “the saddest people always try their hardest to make people feel happy because they know what it’s like to feel absolutely worthless” 
And my personal opinion is that you felt sad when that person said that is because you want someone to see through that mask. 
So this is what i would want someone to say to me in your situation (and i have been there and come back to that feeling many times and will continue to struggle with it for many decades to come, i’ve accepted that) 
I see you. I recognize your pain. I see you are hurting. I wish i could help more than just give you words. But i am proud of you for putting a brave face on and lighting up the world with a smile instead of pain and anger, even though you probably feel that way sometimes. Please let your facade drop and let others in too. You are so good and so kind. 
Sorry if this is weird coming from a stranger, i just wanted to tell you what i would like to hear when i was there and feel/felt that way, and you deserve to hear it too. I hope you find someone that you dont have to smile all the time with"
offmychest,fe0e8fr,t3_enk3za,1578811658.0,"Anyone who writes like you, and has aspirations like you, and genuinely cares like you, is NOT dumb. 
I think youre smarter than you give yourself credit for. You are NOT just house wife material, you are smart stuff material."
