They will block any unusual purchase and give you a call to confirm it. Many a time I had to do that for my flights or big purchase items. Once they blocked my card because of an overseas Uber transaction. You also have 2FA for online purchases. You can link your card (not account) to your phone or smart watch and it hides your card number.   
   
My local bank even has a “vault” to put a designated savings in for higher interest. You need a physical token to access it.   
   
I’ve had terrible experiences with credit cards. Don’t want to name this American company, but basically they refused to accept my payment and then charged me for late payment. Tried to close my account but they never did and then charged me for having low amount in the account. Did not notify me about this, and charged me for late fee for the low amount fee."

You have all rights to your bank account, so just change the login. Your mom will probably get crazy when she finds out, so have a backup plan, like maybe crashing at a friend’s place for awhile. Not sure where you live, it might be possible to rent a room with your savings. Take up some freelance work. Are you still studying? If so, you can check out the financial help or counsellor who can help with your situation. Good luck!

singapore,fed7el6,t1_fed5546,1579002361.0,Yes. I’d rather not say as we’re a small company. All the other Singaporean companies I’ve worked in were also small. Less than 10 employees.
singapore,fed4ryn,t1_fed3p90,1578998833.0,"Have worked in 5-6 Singaporean companies.
I’m in media, so there are peaks and low periods in the year. Peak times we work till 11pm and is not paid. We are told during the interview about this and it’s in the contract, so we can’t complain. Low periods, we are still expected to come in on time and leave a little later than on the dot, or else you walk the shame. During these periods we do nothing but chat or spring clean. 
   
I’m now in an Australian company. Bosses bring us out for drinks every now and then during lunch. Everything is much more relaxed, which turns out brings the creativity out of us more easily. Employees come and go accordingly to their schedules. There is more trust here. We do OT and it is also not paid, but I feel way more appreciated and willing to do so. OT is also not as common because this company knows how to manage clients and their expectations. Can’t say the same for Singaporean companies, saying “no” to clients is a crime for them.
