bikewrench,ffcureg,t1_ffcqy8e,1579807671.0,I've owned a 9658 quad-butted VALite Fuji touring frame for 12 years that's gotten plenty of chips and scrapes. I don't always get to touch them up immediately so sometimes rust forms. I clean the area with 91% rubbing alcohol and then clear nail polish. It holds up surprisingly well and even the first repairs from over a decade haven't changed at all in appearance. The inside of the frame is treated with boeshield t-9.
bipolar,ff94md1,t3_es8dso,1579704722.0,"I drank regularly from age 17 up until I turned 35. I went through an unrelated life-changing event and realized I have more control over my life than I ever thought. It now feels like non-prescription drugs and alcohol were always there to hide that truth.

I'm still weird and always will be, but I feel like myself finally."
BipolarReddit,fei9t13,t3_ep3a51,1579133492.0,"I've never felt interesting enough to worry people are watching me. I don't even give a shit if my cell phone is listening or watching all the time, because so what? The person supposedly ""watching"" has died of boredom long ago, it's all clear now."
bipolar,fei893t,t3_ep2dge,1579132483.0,"Does anyone remember a Simpsons episode where grampa in the nursing home exclaimed, ""The pink ones keep ya from screamin!"" 

I've long wondered if he was taking Seroquel, it sure tends to stop me from screaming. or doing much of anything really."
bikewrench,fedt9x9,t1_fedmvpn,1579019417.0,"Your right in that ISO is a standard, but it's not THE standard either."
bipolar,fe2l6e9,t1_fe2jm1d,1578839796.0,"A mixture of things. I have a lot of coping mechanisms, as I'm sure you do also. I draw pictures and paint. I write journals. I go for walks alone or with my dog. I talk with myself in my own mind as if I'm a completely separate person. 

In the end though, my relationship with her was doomed because she held financial power over me. She didn't want me to get a job and I suspect she chose to be with my boss as a way of getting back at me for not accepting my role as quiet little house husband. It was such an abusive situation but she convinced me that I was the abuser. And I truly believed her for years! I got to the point where I believed I had an evil alter-ego that was gas-lighting her into believing she had to stay with me. I believed I had to take care of her sick parents in order to repent for all my bad behaviors.

I know I can't convince you or anyone else to do anything you haven't already decided yourself. But please try to remember in your lowest moments that life gets better even after it bottoms out and everything is broken. The only way to fail is to give up on your own life. Everything else is a teacher."
bipolar,fe2je16,t1_fe2hvdj,1578839072.0,"It wasn't my idea or my choice, she left me and had started a relationship with my boss. This was my first job after a 7 year stretch of unemployment, mainly because I was helping with her family (very long story). 

I had no idea it was happening either, she just packed up while I was at work on a monday, called me at the very end of my shift to let me know and simply told me to leave town asap. It was all crazy and I truly thought I wasn't going to make it, but here I am and the quality of my life is far better now even though I suffer a new host of trust issues and also PTSD according to my therapist. Still, it was all worth it and I'm lucky I got out even if it wasn't my idea. She was no good for me. I had my doubts about her in the past but always shook it off as paranoia. 

Even though we live with bipolar disorder and possibly other issues, we can still learn to trust our instincts and intuition. We know ourselves better than anyone else ever will. That's even true for the best most healthy marriages."
Shitty_Car_Mods,fe2eeof,t3_engfs1,1578837447.0,It sickens me how many plants are killed by vegetarians each year and they won't even admit it. Plants are living bio-matter with as much right to live as any animal or person. Omnivores at least tend to agree that all parts of the food chain were once alive.
Shitty_Car_Mods,fe2dndm,t3_enf1q3,1578837225.0,Only more chrome and faux vents can save it now!
bipolar,fe2cnzq,t3_enndcl,1578836894.0,"I don't know about this game or specifically what the drawing might mean, but imo if you believe your partner is abusive you'd be doing yourself a big favor to break things off and definitely don't marry him!

I'm guessing that at your age, you two are probably each other's only serious romantic partners and have invested so much of your selves into the relationship that you can't truly imagine it ending. And it'll hurt. A lot. I'm 35 and have been through enough failed relationships including a marriage of 8 years. To end something that you once hoped could be life-long takes a lot out of you, but gives so much back in the form of independence, self-reliance and inner strength."
bipolar,fe2933u,t3_enltlb,1578835827.0,"I have the same problem and I suspect it's common for those with our condition. I got a 2 month extension with my current meds from my primary care doctor, but I think it's time for me to find an actual p doc and talk about options, and the same may be true for you."
bikewrench,fdh26ub,t3_elcbnb,1578413773.0,"I looked as close as I could and see no signs of casing damage. If it were my tire, I'd smear something protective and rubbery over it. I agree with the Shoe Goo recommendation. I've used on shoes, tires and car interiors with good success. They make a black formula that would blend right in."
bikewrench,fcn8bqq,t3_ei2ank,1577805879.0,"Knowing what the name of the bent piece is won't help you or the shipping company because that part that isn't sold or even intended to be replaceable. 

The bent piece of metal functions as a v-brake noodle stop and is firmly attached with a pressed steel rivet. The new v-brake will cost the company around $20."
bipolar,fbabgu5,t1_fbab3bx,1576673016.0,"No I understand, same here. I left feeling like maybe it's time take up less healthy habits, lol."
