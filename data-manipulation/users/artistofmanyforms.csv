depression,fg069el,t1_fg05wwh,1580401133.0,"my friend failed bc he didn't know 1 thing, and my brother passed in manual only knowing how to drive for 3 days. iv'e been driving for over 7 months, and iv'e driven everywhere, the only thing i don't know how to do is parallel park, and it's not required thank god. my mom/brother also almost failed apparently. i just wish my mind would fucking chill out."

Anxiety,fg049gv,t1_fg0421v,1580399880.0,"I can't do that sadly, i don't have a doctor and i can't really afford to be on meds rn. thanks for the suggestion though!"
NoStupidQuestions,ffzuuxm,t1_ffz12x4,1580393502.0,"no, i'm going to upstate Ny. we'll be four hours from the city. my time estimate might be off, last time we drove across america it was from the middle of Michigan to the middle of Florida. I wish i was moving to the city lol."
NoStupidQuestions,ffyrf0t,t1_ffxjmrv,1580353293.0,"well, it's the corona virus and trump rn because our media is all about fear mongering and fighting. they reported on cnn for two days straight about kobe bryant and don't get me wrong, it sucks, but??? it was 7 people, meanwhile kids in the middle east are getting blown up by us and we paint it as ""fighting for freedom"" it's so fucking stupid. and gangs kill and rape more than 7 people a day, but it isn't celebrity's so it doesn't matter. for a country where you can have the ""American dream"" America sure does make you feel small and worthless.  we only report what looks good, causes the most division, or brainwashes or freaks people out the most. i hate it. I love my country and hate it at the same time. i just want some healthy change, ANYTHING. better healthcare, gun laws, lower poverty rates, higher wages, SOMETHING. it's like everything's gotten worse, not better. (also no disrespect to kobe or the other victims, it's fucked up i feel terrible for their family's, it just feels unnecessary to rub it in and report on it constantly, give the family's some room to breath. )"
NoStupidQuestions,ffypzr0,t1_ffy3p1z,1580352320.0,\*laughs in American\* dude I have to drive 24 hours (maybe more) in a few months and i'm looking forward to it. Florida to New York. at least i don't have to drive to LA i guess? lol.
offmychest,ffyp4lm,t1_ffxun4q,1580351731.0,"sameeeeee. my mom says she stayed with him for us, but we wanted them to split ever since we were little and we saw the dysfunction. she probably could have fought for full custody and won.... i would have rather had a single mother than his toxic pathetic self around. it wasn't worth all of these mental problems."
offmychest,ffyovec,t3_evrls7,1580351560.0,"my mom is in the same place, 23 years of assault and emotional abuse and she wants to get out.  sadly me and my brother have been abused emotionally for 19 and 23 years. we have suffered greatly because of it, especially me, panic attacks, memory loss, bad habits and suicidal depression ect. I can't wait to get us away from him, he's ruined our lives for far too long. good luck, you have a whole group of people on here supporting you!"
pics,ffpgpzz,t1_ffowyb0,1580094628.0,"i just looked up a quick bio on him, and almost started sobbing, and probably would have if my mom weren't beside me. this poor man. these nazis deserve hell and pain for all of eternity. feeding people alive to dogs, chopping childrens skulls in half, whipping and hanging people upside down till they die, if i could go back in time and capture one of these fucking heathens i would rip every sense from his body, touch, smell, taste, sight, hearing, i'd skin him inch by inch, cut finger off by finger, cut his tongue off so he couldn't say any filth before he dies, i wish those people got the revenge they so rightfully deserved."
offmychest,ffh7xg2,t1_ffgycte,1579925656.0,..... so this is why my cat demands i refill his bowl when it's barely empty???? holy cow i  had no fricken clue..... reddit yet again is educating me lol. should i put his food on a dish then?
depression,ffh7iep,t3_etgu0i,1579925302.0,"every time i'm a crying mess, my cat forces herself on me, or stays by my side. they know when you're sad. i  cut my dogs nail the other day and made her bleed,  i was so upset i hurt her that she could tell and looked at me and wagged her tail like she already forgave me and it's ok, we really don't deserve dogs or cats. I love both and can't choose, i'm neither a cat nor dog person.  i am an animal person. if it weren't for them my whole family would have committed suicide by now. thank god for our furry babies. they also let you hug or pet them as much as you want which is also really relaxing."
AskReddit,ffh2vnn,t1_fffwztl,1579921633.0,"bro i love hugs so much so that i woke up a few months ago to see my big brother standing in the door way and reached for a hug, (he always hugs back and doesn't mind)  to me they're a form of comfort, bonding, or just greeting, but always love. they're great, and not just for us girls. hugs are the shit. i have a rule, too, i won't let go till the other person does. i'll hug you as long as you need it, and i'm tall and just the right amount of thick, i'm like a pillow that hugs back."
NoStupidQuestions,ff533nw,t1_ff4qxoz,1579578910.0,"also the way they sway under you like a shark in water, i didn't know that's what people called them lol but it makes sense. my jet black chonker was just doing that with me and it's always adorable when they do it."

depression,fevepkb,t1_feu80hd,1579396496.0,"19, and i'm the same way. I went through so much trauma around or because of my brother/mother that when i'm with them, i'm bursting at the seams with anxiety. I mostly have panic attacks around them, when i'm alone and not thinking about the past and i forget about my anxiety. i realize i'm in control, and i'm calling the shots, nobody can abuse me in this moment. but when i'm around them it all floods back. Something I noticed; so i get bad anxiety around my father because he's been the cause of 99% of my truama/or problems, but he was really sick and asked me to take him to the clinic, i drove him around town, and i felt...fine. it's like because he could barely do anything i felt fine, he couldn't talk about others and gossip, couldn't say horrible things, i was driving and he couldn't say anything bad about me driving him around like he normally does and it was because he realized he was vulnerable. it felt great having that power, not to give a shit because he was too feeble and weak to do anything to upset me.  I know this will sound terrible but i can't wait till he's in a hospital dying, maybe it'll hit him that he shouldn't have been such a garbage person and maybe his kids would have cared more, i don't even know if i'll cry when he dies. He's ruined my life, me getting to see him broken is the least the universe owes me. as for my brother/mother, iv'e forgiven the years of abuse they've done to me, and i still love them, but it is so hard to control your anxiety when your triggers are your own family. all three of them are the reasons why iv'e thought about killing myself every night since i was 11. i would never tell them that because i know how badly it would hurt them, but they should have known better than to rely on a child to keep them alive."
depression,fesmp2g,t1_feslg5f,1579366863.0,"no problem, they might help but just be careful and do your research, i used to take allot of supplements and i would get angry when i wouldn't feel better, the only real way you will know if you need them is if you get a blood test!"
depression,fesm6r2,t1_fengwit,1579366697.0,"probably, i try to not overthink it but it's hard dude. I hope i can someday not give a shit what people think of me.... it did help :)"
depression,fesly8w,t1_fenthno,1579366627.0,"i get that, my family has always made me feel like an invisible looser, so i want constant validation that i'm not, and when i fail at something it's like the world is ending. shitty fathers sure are fun, huh? my dad ruined my life by ruining my mom and brothers lives and i hate him for it. fuck your dad, i'm saying your'e great, and you better believe it."
depression,fesl664,t3_eqc90a,1579366370.0,"i'm in the same boat, friend. i think something could be fucking with my hormones, i'm in fight or flight 24/7 but insanely tired, and my stomach hurts throughout the day.  i feel you, if you find anything out do an update please! i hope you feel better soon!"
depression,feneg2k,t1_fehlyno,1579282930.0,thank you <3
depression,fena7f3,t3_epydpj,1579280327.0,"I get that, i only watch the news at night, i won't watch the debates because they're pointless, and i only keep up with politics for one person and that's andrew yang. if he were president i could finally start my dream business, go to the doctor, and get the therapy i need. without him we'll all keep suffering, so even if you don't wan't to be in politics anymore please still vote in the primaries and/or general election.  look into him, there is practically nothing bad about him and iv'e only seen him complement others, not tear them down. for once in my life i'm hopeful for this country and it's because of him.  I want people like us to finally get the help we need, instead of being swept under the rug, and sadly who is president has allot to do with the well being of the people in this country. I hope you feel better soon. :)"
KindVoice,fehjrt9,t1_fbg03to,1579117974.0,"thank you, and i'm sorry i took so long to reply. as usual i had allot of drama to deal with over the holidays and iv'e even been too tired to type out allot. I think my biggest problem right now is that i have 0 self confidence in everything i do, being told your'e stupid over and over really makes you feel like you are. even if people don't say it with their words. I think that more than anything is the reason why i haven't done anything with my life yet. Even just now, i cut my dogs nails on one foot because my other family members refuse to take her to get them cut, and i made one bleed, i felt instantly bad and then wanted to have a meltdown because i realized that if my brother found out he would yell at me about how i'm a dumb ass and i shouldn't have been doing it. i was driving with him and he was criticizing my driving, i did something illegal that everyone over there does so that i wouldn't lose my mom who i was following, and he said three times ""that was unintelligent"". i also tried driving stick shift yesterday for the first time and stalled the car out over and over and over and i felt so fucking stupid. i'm terrified to take my driving test because i feel like if i fail it i'll feel like the biggest idiot in the world. I get tired of walking on eggshells, i get tired of being constantly sad, i get tired of panic attacks and dissociation, i get tired of not being able to remember anything because of the stress and nobody believing me, I get tired of being yelled at, i get tired of being tired.  And nobody cares, they only care about themselves. I do realize that they should have never put me in the positions they did, i just realized i saw it sooner.  i have even tried telling them i think i have cptsd and they just say ""oh we have ptsd too"" it's so frustrating being the only logical human around. i'm sorry for venting again, i'm just so upset all the time. You may not be 100% better, and maybe we do just have to accept what happened to us, but at least you are doing a little better, i desperately want to get better myself. When i do have a car/license which i hope i can get done soon, i'll go to the library and check those books out!"
AskReddit,fe6899m,t1_fe4xa94,1578883956.0,"i like to collect things like  wheat pennies, euros, pounds, and star notes or old printed bills. i know they aren't worth much but it's fun looking for them!"
offmychest,fe67rlv,t3_ensp21,1578883671.0,"i think this 24/7 as a straight girl, they have no business being this beautiful,yet, there they are, being gorgeous no matter what they look like. even allot of old men can get away with it, it's a crime lmao. I can find beauty in most people, and it looks like i'm not the only one lol. i think this way about woman, too, people can just be.... so fricken cute, hot, and intriguing with little effort, it's amazing."
CowChop,fcwg785,t1_fcwekaw,1578024800.0,"it's good but mostly just joking around, not at all like cow chops constant changing humor.  My brother found cc through fun haus and preferred cc..... but fun haus is fun and everyone there is a sweet heart and is honestly funny. also lindsy is working there now, maybe she'll show up in the future!"
KindVoice,fbehnx8,t1_fb9xsy7,1576785909.0,"THANK YOU. i get so tired of everyone acting like getting a job/license is easy or going to fix my problems. it's the first step but everyone acts like that will take all of the pain away. there is so much i'm gonna have to do to get to the healthiest version of me and it could take years, especially since here in america mental health isn't taken seriously and everyone is poor af. I was able to handle everything ok when i was a kid because it was my normal, but now that i know better, i just can't deal with the stress anymore, and everyone on reddit has helped me realize i shouldn't have to tolerate it. My moms best friend even reached out to tell me that she's tried telling her to back off on me and that i was just a kid, but my mom all way's just brushed it off, and that she agrees that iv'e been through allot. EVERYONE around me has tried telling me that my family isn't healthy but like i said it took a while for me to fully come to that conclusion. and my brother has been sober for months, but i'm always terrified of him relapsing. i love him and don't want him to go back down that path. and as much as i love my mom, it drives me crazy to see her fuck up time and time again and self harm and be abusive her self. I see myself having to take care of them in a situation like you as well, my father could very well have cancer, or drop dead of a heart attack any time, he is by far the most unhealthy person i know, smokes two packs a day, obese, drinks himself to sleep, eats day old raw meat, ect. and she's slowly going blind because she won't go to the damn doctor because it cost money. my brother has even told me i need to be the one to take care of them, it's bullshit. i'm sorry you've been through this too, it's ridiculous how many people get abused and then thrown into the world like everything is supposed to be ok when nothing is ok. i'm glad you made it out and your'e ok. Iv'e often imagined a world where i'm happy and surrounded by those that love me, iv'e dreamed about it a few times and when i have dreams like that i never want to wake up, i can relate to what you said 100%. it may be a bit nerdy but ultimately it's what has gotten me through the last 7 years. if i didn't have fiction or imagination i think i would be dead by now."
