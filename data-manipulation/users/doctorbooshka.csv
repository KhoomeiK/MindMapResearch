Marvel,ff7hzut,t1_ff7duq6,1579649999.0,Is it possible to have a new Red Skull come about from a different universe post multiverse of madness? Honestly how dope would it be to bring in multiverse Red Skull and Doctor Doom.

starterpacks,fenn7lx,t3_eq12z8,1579288091.0,I gotta say the worst thing I ever saw in the men‚Äôs bathroom was at a movie theater. We had just got done watching Hot Fuzz and we do as most people do run to the bathroom to piss that 24 ounce soda we were holding in our bladders. Suddenly as we enter the bathroom my cousin stops with a gasp as he stairs down a stall. My uncle and I make the turn to see shit literally exploded on all the walls and the ceiling. This wasn‚Äôt no prank smear job this was some Ebola or something. I‚Äôm talking about an ass explosion. I‚Äôm pretty positive whoever made that shit might of died that night. It was like someone bent over and just nuclear bombed the stall with diarrhea. It fucking was on the ceiling. I was disgusted but oddly impressed. Felt bad when my uncle told an employee and the dude said not again. I would have quit if I had been assigned that.
NintendoSwitch,fenizhe,t1_fejrc90,1579285713.0,Honestly hated 1 but 2&3 had me hooked. 1 felt more like a rip-off of GTA where 2 & 3 really established their own identity.
NintendoSwitch,feniqeh,t1_fej9583,1579285559.0,I‚Äôm honestly surprised we haven‚Äôt gotten at least FO3. The port for Skyrim is pretty awesome and I‚Äôd love to be able to take FO3 on the go. It‚Äôs one of those great games where you can go explore for 10 mins or go explore for 10 hours.
NintendoSwitch,fenhwuj,t3_epbnvj,1579285053.0,I‚Äôve been saying this since the patent leaks of a VR headset came out for the Switch but I would pay for nice plastic version of the labo VR with a head strap. I know Nintendo doesn‚Äôt want people to be so stuck in games or whatever but there are a few games that could really take advantage of this. Imagine being able to play Skyrim with the motion controls. Don‚Äôt understand why they haven‚Äôt.
NintendoSwitch,fenf9hj,t3_eq1waj,1579283429.0,So will the Multiplayer be playable in Bioshock 2 if this happens? I remember actually having a lot of fun playing that. Anyone know if you could in the other collection?

homeless,fehaj3a,t1_fe654rb,1579112564.0,Actually depends on the time of the year. Right now you will for sure have to pay the $40 fee. Though they run deals during the year where it can be as low as a $1 or waived completely. You don‚Äôt need a checking account at least at Fitness Connection but you will need a debit card. You can get the reload cards that work. Though the biggest issue is you usually have to give an address which some people use prior addresses.

I do like the colors for the Switch Lite but I wish the regular one had some cool colors. It‚Äôs possible that the new console supposedly coming this year will be that.

LifeProTips,fdsbtej,t1_fdsbeu6,1578699005.0,I totally get that but we live in the Information Age. Complaint about a repost on Reddit is like complaint about seeing a 6 month old meme on FB that you first saw on Reddit. Who knew that humans often have the same ideas and want to share it.

LifeProTips,fds99q7,t1_fdrjnt7,1578697297.0,I mean the first thing I would do would be to search through Reddit on tips for being homeless. There have been points in my life where I‚Äôve come close so I‚Äôve learned a lot from this site to help in case it does happen. Also these tips work well for people who live in cars and tiny houses on wheels. I‚Äôm actually planning on building an ambulance home here soon where you convert it into a rv basically. So this tip actually helps me since I work right next to a gym and can go shower work out before I go back to the land I‚Äôm renting.

LifeProTips,fdrh25d,t1_fdqrcy9,1578684475.0,Yes because people don‚Äôt just stop becoming homeless. This could be valuable for some who didn‚Äôt know this.
LifeProTips,fdrgxye,t1_fdqo1y1,1578684408.0,They do this around the holidays. Don‚Äôt worry it will go back down. Usually they will lock you in at a price too so if you were paying $10 usually you won‚Äôt get up charged.
LifeProTips,fdrgssn,t1_fdqn9rc,1578684322.0,I will say this time of year is the worst time to buy a membership. Wait a few months until after the NYE resolutions are over. I know Anytime Fitness usually runs a $10 a month deal and if you get it at the right time sometimes the waiver your yearly fee.
AskMen,fdp4ge4,t3_em9w3x,1578619768.0,"I am actually sitting in the place I met her a little over 2 years ago. It was seriously like the movie Big Fish when Ewen McGregor sees the girl of his dreams and time stands still. She was wearing a long sundress in the middle of summer. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I host trivia so she was playing along at the brewery  I work at. So as she walked up each time to bring me her answer sheet, I couldn't help but bring a smile each time. Eventually we began to talk after my trivia games and she was brilliant. She was a former journalist and had the same feelings I had about politics, religion and mental health which bonded us. Soon I began to walk her to her car every night she was there. Turns out she was 6 years older than me but for some reason it didn't seem to matter to any of us. We were equals. One magical day walking her to the car during a rainy Thursday after Trivia she grabbed me and kissed me. It was the first time in my life where I didn't engage a kiss to someone. It was magical and I feel in love. Over the next year our relationship became more of being weird best friends who snuggled and kissed. It was magical regardless. She was my best friend. We were planning on being roommates in November and she was looking at apartments for us. We had planned a trip for my birthday up in Ashville and she had already taken off work. She died from a car accident two weeks after I took her camping for the first time in her life.

&#x200B;

I have been depressed ever since. I don't want to live in a world without her. She was my dream. Now she's 6 feet under and I couldn't even afford to go a state over to go to her funeral. Hoping to save some money to go read the book we used to read together. She was my dream girl and I am just lucky I got to spend some time with her before she passed. I'll never forget her.

RIP

Amanda

Marvel,fdo0fnw,t1_fdlqng0,1578596555.0,"X-Men, Spider-Man, and Blade for sure ushered in the comic book movie era."
esist,fdmz148,t1_fdmy7iq,1578571960.0,No it was Trumps unwritten rule not to report hazing and the kid snitched to his parents and then Trump was removed from that floor.
Marvel,fdldd4n,t1_fdl6olr,1578521612.0,I think the big thing was Marvel licensing Spider-Man shows all around the world back in the day.
Marvel,fdlczxr,t1_fdlbvhg,1578521390.0,Well the main reason is because he‚Äôs had tv shows since the 60‚Äôs. He basically is the face of Marvel until recently and I‚Äôd even argue that he‚Äôs taking his throne back with the new movies.
AccidentalWesAnderson,fdkxtpb,t1_fdkxiuv,1578513377.0,Reminds me of the medical pavilion and how it would look pre chaos. Like the lettering on the signs and symmetry. Now imagine this picture with blood smeared everywhere and the signs hanging lose.
Marvel,fdkwv37,t1_fdkd2nq,1578512815.0,I mean he is probably the most well known superhero around the world. There is almost a spider man show in every country back in 60s/70‚Äôs. Also helps that his movie helped usher in the comic book movies.
blackmirror,fdkw8wm,t3_elvgiz,1578512452.0,I always get people to start with 15 Million Merits. I think it‚Äôs the perfect mix to get someone started on the show but I also could be biased because it‚Äôs my favorite episode.
AccidentalWesAnderson,fdkvrhh,t3_elrdov,1578512166.0,Reminds me of Bioshock.
Pizza,fdkv9lk,t1_fdkv3h2,1578511873.0,Yeah its the closest thing I‚Äôve found. Not a lot of good options for a true NY slice. It‚Äôs pricey but damn is there supreme really good.
Pizza,fdkttv8,t1_fdkswx2,1578511026.0,It‚Äôs hard but there are a few. We got a place in Charlotte called Tony‚Äôs which to me is the best southern NY style around.

politics,fdjjdhd,t1_fdjja7k,1578473534.0,I mean if they had launched an attack on Israel i think as our ally we would most likely help them and most likely would go through with the coalition. Now we face a possible war without any allies. I‚Äôm not saying Iran has no blame in this but we for sure fucked up.
StarWars,fdjj4u3,t1_fdjiyz3,1578473205.0,Yeah have no idea. I just always loved seeing it in ANH when I was kid. For some reason I always thought it meant they were more like low level guys.
politics,fdjj2gt,t1_fdjiww4,1578473115.0,"If we mock them and belittle them we give them power. It‚Äôs about finding the human element. That we all want is truly the same. It‚Äôs hard but I‚Äôm not going to turn my back on people. In the end i try my best not to be in an echo chamber and I learn a lot from people. I find it refreshing at least when a hard core republican can stand my ideas and yet we both end up agreeing on a lot of things. Just different ways to go about it.

We all just want freedom. Let‚Äôs fight for that regardless of religion, race or party."
Thetruthishere,fdjipkm,t1_fdjim6s,1578472633.0,"That‚Äôs good man. I suffered a bout of it when I was a teenager. I was diagnosed bipolar and realized a lot of my internal dialogue was not me nor was it demons or angels, just good old messed up wiring in the brain. 

What I will say is don‚Äôt dwell on it, get out there and be you. Those voices in our heads don‚Äôt own us. Even if they are demons."
Pizza,fdji4l4,t1_fdji2n0,1578471851.0,Having never had one this looks delicious and what I imagine they look like. Really wish I could try one but living in the south we barely get good NY slices down here let alone a Chicago pie.

Let‚Äôs hope he gets a chance this year. He‚Äôs the most viable candidate."
politics,fdjhur4,t1_fdjhrrv,1578471496.0,Exactly. They would be anti war just like Trump claimed to be. Bring the troops back yadda yadda. However I doubt we would be in this situation let alone during an election year with Hillary.
