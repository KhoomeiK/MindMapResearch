news,ffl44pd,t1_ffkhb19,1580034472.0,"In all honesty, China's response isn't helping.  Quarantining 56 million people and shutting down transportation is something that ramps up panic.  The fact that, even if China was crystal clear about everything that was going, wouldn't help because China's history about covering everything up makes their actions look like something to panic over.

Personally, I'm just trying to survive regular flu season (kindergarten teacher, so I'm exposed a lot), and just watching this entire scenario unfold in wonder.  Mostly because I love sci-fi like this, but also just the concept of China's actions boggle my mind.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but their actions do make it look like it's full on WWZ starting."

I was just throwing up a chapter a day because I roughly knew where I wanted it to go and just found myself writing every day after work.  It was just heartbreaking to write, and I ended up baking every night after writing too (finally made successful macrons!).

It's easily my most popular fic.  The closest to it, for kudos and comments, is a James Bond fic that I wrote nearly half a decade ago.  And everything else usually has about a dozen kudos, maybe a comment, and maybe a hundred or so hits.

I tend to post in dying fandoms, so I think a chunk of the popularity for my Witcher fic just happens to be that I posted right as the fandom really started revving up and everyone was reading everything.  It's gotten good response, and I've never had a thousand kudos on a fic before, so clearly it's at least good, but timing and chapter post speed really helped a lot.  As far as hits goes it's honestly got barely any, and not increasing now that it's finished and dropping back in pages."

The foreign language ones make me laugh.  I am passably fluent in Japanese (I live in Japan, so it's a daily use language for me), and the oddities when people use Google Translate are great.  Google Translate sucks pretty bad for English to Japanese and vice versa, so a lot gets mistranslated.  'Play', in English meaning theatrical play, will get translated to 'play', as in 'play outside'.  And lots of other things like that.

If you don't know a language, don't use it.  You can have characters using it without actually writing in it.  But for the love of everything, don't ruin a fic by using a language you know nothing about.  Nothing breaks the tension more in a dramatic fic than really shitty translations that turn it into a comedy."

The fandom you're in may be a lesser read fandom, your fic could have been lost amongst the thousands of Christmas fluff fics that inundate most fandoms every year (I avoid anything with that kind of tagging because I'm sick of it, and I haven't read any in years), you're rather new so it could be that you are still learning from your writing (try getting a beta, a lot of newer writers don't realize how much bad grammar and formatting drives readers away), what you write about doesn't interest the fandom, the tags or summary are lacking and thus no one is interested, etc.

There are a lot of issues involved.  The fact that you automatically decried your fandom as 'only interested in smut, that's why they don't like my writing' is, honestly, not the greatest of signs on your part.

bestoflegaladvice,fdunytj,t1_fdtpufc,1578736037.0,"While her lashing out violently isn't acceptable behavior, I'm wondering if it's the only way she can show her frustration.  OP never commented on his Japanese ability or her English ability, so there could be an issue that, in their marriage, there has been no way for them to communicate in a healthy manner.  She could be living in a country where she just does not have a grasp on the language, and that is incredibly isolating.  Imagine going years living in a country where no one can understand you, you have no support, and even your own spouse can't support or understand you.  It's a great way to set up for a severe mental break down.  And it could be reasonable to see why she doesn't want to be in the marriage anymore, and doesn't want her child raised by a person that can't see beyond themselves.

On the other hand, Japan may have signed the Hague convention, but they don't enforce it at all.  Japanese laws about children and how they're enforced is a very complicated and difficult issue.  And, unfortunately, the lack of enforcement means that Japanese parents are able to keep their kidnapped children with no issue, and, in other cases, children have died because laws prevent action by authorities.  It's a very tragic system that needs a severe overhaul."
