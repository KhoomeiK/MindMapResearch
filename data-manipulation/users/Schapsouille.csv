Last time I felt like falling backwards 90 degrees *inside* the sofa. Vision going dark like going through a black tunnel backwards really fast and feeling your body merging with the furniture. Ughh. Won't try that again."

More seriously, this is a [sovereign's orb](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign%27s_Orb) and a crown so two of the crown's jewels. As for the meaning of it associated with the phrase and the red color, I couldn't say for sure."

Anarchism,ffc68z4,t1_ffbwglp,1579792502.0,"Firstly these are not any cops properly speaking, these are CRS (Republican Security Company), they are basically all the left overs from french cops who didn't pass the exam. Picture a brainless battle grunt who's favorite sport is to crack the skulls of protesters.

Secondly, protests have been raging non stop in France for more than a year now and the CRS don't ever miss a chance to mutilate everyone that comes in their range, be they protesters, press, bystanders, hell even their civilian dressed counterparts. There are many, many pieces of evidence documenting their barbary (just research violence crs).

Since the beginning of the protests they have killed 11 people and mutilated more than 5000 and none of them have been held accountable.

There is a widespread national hate against them so before you make statements like these, next time try to educated yourself."
