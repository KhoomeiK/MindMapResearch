When I was in high school we had to get signed off by the chemistry teacher to take AP Chemistry the next year. I went up to him and said ""Hey will you approve me for AP Chem, I'll do my best""

I will never for the rest of my life forget him saying ""your current best is not good enough, but you will do it"" and then signing the paper."
wholesomememes,ffgtv7n,t1_ffgn8e9,1579914924.0,"> After that, I'll stop trying.

When I was a chemistry TA through all of undergrad I realized that there are some students who do a fantastic job of putting on a ""I'm trying my best"" act, when in reality they are barely doing the minimum outside of class. As soon as they get an unsatisfactory grade they can really turn on what appear to be genuine emotions about doing poorly.

I had a student in organic chemistry lab who was like this. I felt awful for her, spent time before/after class working with her because she always got super down on herself when I gave back quizzes/lab reports. Eventually I mentioned this to the professor because I felt bad that she was struggling, so he looked up her work in the class (as opposed to the lab) at which point I realized she was never doing the online homework assignments and her lecture attendance was like 30%."

LivestreamFail,ff4e2n7,t1_ff3mg0b,1579561414.0,"Yes, I am aware of the APA guidelines for what is considered mania. The APA also considers mania to be a psychiatric emergency necessitating immediate treatment. In fact, mania is one of the most common reasons (behind acute suicidality) for ER doctors to exercise their right to place a 24 hour hold (immediate detention), and for psychiatrists to exercise *their* right to place an additional 72 hour hold (emergency detention).

When I say that mania is not self-terminating, I'm not saying that a manic person without modern medicine would be manic for the rest of their life. In reality, mania is very often terminated after hospitalization and treatment. It is exceedingly rare for a manic individual to continue functioning to the end of the episode without intervention from friends/family/coworkers/law enforcement. Family members of patients with a history of mania are counselled on early detection of manic episodes so that psychiatric evaluation and treatment can be obtained as quickly as possible.

A non-insignificant percentage of manic episodes that are not treated as emergencies (i.e. the patient is left to their own devices for 7+ days) end in harm to self or others. An even larger percentage end in financially destructive behaviors. Just because a manic individual is currently ""just"" talking your ear off doesn't mean that they can't quickly begin to act irrationally in a way that places themselves or others in danger.

I respect that you took a psychology class and know what mania is, but please be aware that in clinical practice mania is always treated as a psychiatric emergency, and any physician who discharges a patient in a manic episode (no matter how ""mild"" it may seem at the time) is at risk of medical malpractice."

If this is really your understanding of mania then no, your universities don't actually teach people sufficiently. 

Mania is not a self-terminating state. People with mania can and will escalate their behavior to the point of grave disability and become a danger to themselves or others. It is treated as a psychiatric emergency requiring hospitalization."

He has had hypomanic episodes, which is why he meets the criteria for bipolar 2. You can have hypomanic episodes and not really know it. You can't have a manic episode and not know it. Mania is a psychiatric emergency requiring hospitalization. Without medical intervention, mania is not even remotely compatible with functioning in society, and manic episodes don't tend to end on their own."

Not to gatekeep or ""ACKTUALLY"" here, but this is not mania. Mania is a psychiatric emergency requiring hospitalization, and if you're around someone who is manic one of your first thoughts is that they need to go to the hospital immediately.

It also caused bots to crash (and subsequently die to you) because the bot would start spamming clicks and lock itself up.
