It isn't sped up btw, he wags this fast for real."

pokemon,fe6lgqj,t3_envu96,1578894872.0,Totally agree. I want a beard option for my character to make it look even remotely like myself.
pokemontrades,fdr5uxw,t1_fdr5le9,1578679874.0,No problem. PM me a room number and we'll go ahead

Have any of these?"
pokemontrades,fdq82jv,t1_fdpxk7q,1578658758.0,"A ""foreign"" one for shiny hunting, means you need one from a different language. The person replying to you is from the UK, so probably has an English Slowpoke as well, which won't work for your shiny odds.

You need a pokemon from a different language game, not a different region one."
stunfisk,fdjobtg,t1_fdj66dz,1578480670.0,Yeah the sound seems very bad/hard to follow. Also the background noise is distracting imo.

VGC,fdgihsg,t3_ela33m,1578398199.0,"Sounds cool, but I was wondering how the schedule works. So you have 1 battle each week, do you have to communicate with each other when you have time to battle etc? Since it's international, time zones might make things more difficult."
