A means none, without, lacking. Those are your options, no matter how much you argue otherwise. Sexuality is about what sex you are attracted to, not what you are attracted to.

That isn't what dictator was. Dictators were given absolute power *for the task they were given to complete*. The title was originally given as pretty much absolute power, true, but by even the 3rd BCE it was given for specific purpose. For instance, a bunch were given absolute power for the purpose filling magistracies. Sulla was given the title to write laws and fix the constitution. Caesar just took back the age-old tradition (that had been out of favor for more than 200 years at that point) of being dictator ""for a general reasons"". And he was given the title by a Senate he stacked with his own men. 

Taking an office that is meant to be for 6 months in perpetuity is definitely abusing the office. I mean, he literally took the title Dictator Perpetuo, dictator in perpetuity. Sulla took the title, what, 3 times in a row? And used it to write proscription lists, something that was way beyond the pale to dictators previously. That is absolutely abuse of power."

They mutinied. They almost mutinied once before that, as well, when Alexander marched them up into Central Asia. They were also furious with him when he had Parmenion executed, and it took his generals talking to them to get them to accept it. And he continually had to replenish troops, by the time he went up into Sogdiana he was using an extremely ethnically mixed army. Some of that is casualties of course, but some of that is needing to replace people who refused to go any further and be away longer and turned around to go back to Greece or hold down their conquests. Hell, when the Lamian War was fought, Antipater had a whole bunch of veterans from Alexander's conquests. Anitogonus held down Asia and kept the supply lines open using a mix of local levees and Macedonians returning from the front.

Yes, that literally means, according to how history is studied academically (and has been for a few centuries at this point) she did not exist. 

>you have not got the maturity to see any other way than yours

You are literally arguing your way, against all historians on the subject, because you believe you are right. You are straight up saying that how historians define whether or not something existed in the historical record is wrong. Diaochan **does not** exist in the historical record. A women she is **based on** does, that does not mean Diaochan does. Just like the Amazons, just like Rama, just like Arthur, just like Robin Hood. It is the exact same thing, no matter how hard you try to argue otherwise. 

>but please for the love of fucking god do not talk shit about my academic education in history

It is clear you have none. Zero. You might have education in history, but not in an academic setting. Because you would very quickly have been corrected in claiming a person who is **based on** a real historical character existed, when she absolutely did not. Being based on a historical figure **is not existing to historians**. Once again, that is the exact same thing as Arthur. No historian would claim Arthur existed without a massive caveat."

You clearly do not, because it is not different at all. The story of King Arthur comes much later than the first historical record of Badon Hill.

That is not how history works. By your logic, Santa Clause exists, because he is based a tiny, tiny bit on a historical figure. By your logic, Odysseus existed, with zero evidence of him, because Troy existed. By your logic, Hengist and Horsa existed because their names are mentioned, but literally no other evidence of them exists. By your logic, Amazons existed. By your logic, Romulus existed because Rome exists. By your logic, Numa Pompilius existed, because the Romans had religion, and ascribed it to him.

You mean semantics? Pedantics isn't a word. You are being extremely pedantic, but pedantic isn't a noun.

Again, that is like 5% of Diaochan's story. That is not enough to say the character existed.

That isn't what dictator was. Dictators were given absolute power *for the task they were given to complete*. The title was originally given as pretty much absolute power, true, but by even the 3rd BCE it was given for specific purpose. For instance, a bunch were given absolute power for the purpose filling magistracies. Sulla was given the title to write laws and fix the constitution. Caesar just took back the age-old tradition (that had been out of favor for more than 200 years at that point) of being dictator ""for a general reasons"". And he was given the title by a Senate he stacked with his own men. 

Taking an office that is meant to be for 6 months in perpetuity is definitely abusing the office. I mean, he literally took the title Dictator Perpetuo, dictator in perpetuity. Sulla took the title, what, 3 times in a row? And used it to write proscription lists, something that was way beyond the pale to dictators previously. That is absolutely abuse of power."

They mutinied. They almost mutinied once before that, as well, when Alexander marched them up into Central Asia. They were also furious with him when he had Parmenion executed, and it took his generals talking to them to get them to accept it. And he continually had to replenish troops, by the time he went up into Sogdiana he was using an extremely ethnically mixed army. Some of that is casualties of course, but some of that is needing to replace people who refused to go any further and be away longer and turned around to go back to Greece or hold down their conquests. Hell, when the Lamian War was fought, Antipater had a whole bunch of veterans from Alexander's conquests. Anitogonus held down Asia and kept the supply lines open using a mix of local levees and Macedonians returning from the front.

War weariness is absolutely a thing. Even when you are conquering and winning like a boss, some people get absolutely sick of it. Caesar faced the same thing, and he had to shame his legion (XIII IIRC) into staying with him for the civil war."

Athen's Thirty Tyrants weren't all individually seen in a negative light, but the fact that they got to power through illegal means of strongmanning their way in definitely was.

Like in an episode I listened to last night, she was talking about the Historia Augusta, and it is clear she wants to just talk about it for multiple whole episodes because it is such a fun, ridiculous text."
TinyUnits,fdko66h,t1_fdknvdp,1578507651.0,"I have boys now, but all of my others have been girls, and only 1 of the 6 was chill. Boy rats are little shits too, but they mostly grow out of it in like a year from what I've read (one of mine hasn't at a little over a year, he is naughty!), but the 5 other girls I had were rambunctious, destructive little jerks their whole lives."
TinyUnits,fdknx5q,t3_elruxc,1578507500.0,"These are the only kids I ever want. Partly so I can say things like ""yeah, my kids keep chewing on my furniture and eating their jackets"" and such to people. I would name them Totes and Toats, so I can say ""Totes, my goats!"" and make them carry around little tote bags. Lotta effort for a pun, but totally worth it."

Just had to go watch the music video because it is so silly."

TinyUnits,fdkml47,t1_fdk5pde,1578506684.0,Yeah they really are great. Get some more!
TinyUnits,fdkmimn,t1_fdj5efd,1578506640.0,"Right! They are such good little critters! I mean, sure rats caused the Black Death, but that was the fleas fault, and a different species of rat, gotta forgive them. I am sorry to hear about your rat, they are sadly very prone to cancer, and you should most definitely get some more. Mine are currently being adorable blobs. Boy rats are so lazy!"
TinyUnits,fdiyyyv,t3_ellbwm,1578454281.0,I always upvote rats. Mine are currently monching and being a general blob.
