You have these options for handling errors:

- Each function returns a boolean indicating an error; values are passed via `var` or `out` parameters. Each function caller **must** check the return value first.
- Create an exception when an error is detected. The exception is immediately propagated up to the function callers until it encounters a matching `try-except` block. (Note that this isn't the optimal use of an exception: they are [relatively slow](http://ithare.com/infographics-operation-costs-in-cpu-clock-cycles/) (though it doesn't matter much in a program like this one) and meant to indicate a bug in the program.) This avoids having error handling code everywhere.
