fatlogic,feif7nn,t1_feh0y99,1579137122.0,"Thank you. Wishing you a pain free run. 

This taught me even even if I can't ever run again there are other things I'll find to do. The pushing for health part is the part I admire most about myself (on a run, bike, in the pool, weights, or even physical therapy)."
fatlogic,fef4sch,t3_eomg76,1579048173.0,"Rant: My big toe has stress fracture. Officially out for my first half marathon and I was finally feeling confident I could do it! The plan had been to meet up with friends from a couple different states and all run together. 

Rave: Now I guess I'll be the team mom and help everyone with easy drop off and cheer them on, because feet heal and next year exists and there will be more races. I had my cry moment but was able to brush off my shoulders because I'm so much stronger mentally than before I lost weight. Chasing health not vanity in ways I never knew I'd love."

loseit,febke8a,t3_eo8jdq,1578959700.0,"Men no longer look through me either. I see it as a feedback loop - both positive and negative. The confidence I get from finally achieving a long term goal is amazing and I'm sure spills to all aspects of my life. I'm in the phase of getting used to more attention so sometimes it weirds me out but other times I'm becoming more comfortable with it. When I was bigger and smiled it was often taken by other people that I was happy, where now I have noticed it being perceived as potential interest. I'm adjusting.

On dating I had to learn how to spot people that were not being genuine. My bigger weight had been a bit of a natural filter for that! I had to let go of some unhealthy resentment. Lots more first date opportunity, but same chance of connection in my experience."
loseit,fe4olw4,t3_ennq98,1578861413.0,"Hi! 
What about frozen meals? Yup, they are high in sodium but honestly so much healthier than I bet you are eating now. It's how I started and they were one of the tools that made it possible for me to lose 150+ lbs. I started cooking more after losing 100 and having more confidence and energy.
YMMV, but for me the goal is not perfection eating, but to be just 20% healthier the next couple months. Then 20% healthier the next couple months after that. It felt less enormous that way.

I started with walking (for mooonths, I'm big fan of low impact for us bigger folk)....and now am running a couple 10ks a week and weight training. The weight loss comes from the food I eat though!"
1200isplenty,fdrld9s,t3_emn4sx,1578686219.0,"My favorite premade stuff:

Canned soups with a piece of fruit, canned chili (small ones), packaged tuna with salad, premade salads when on sale, hillshire farms lunchables, frozen protein lentil veggie mixes (eaten straight out of the bag), hummus spread on stuff, lower cal frozen burritos, 'fit' frozen breakfast sandwiches, lean cuisines, lettuce and deli meat roll ups, boiled eggs in the fridge, yogurt and fruit.

I put a lot of fresh spinach in the above to make it healthier."
fatlogic,fdrgq0l,t1_fdrd9z8,1578684276.0,"I think this bimodal stuff is happening in a bunch of areas, not just health. 

I worry so much about the obesity epidemic. I was a part of it for far too long, and the biggest root change was mental. How I think about food and my relationship with it is really what worked and led to the better choices, and honestly gives me confidence I'll keep it off. I track calories but like to think about what vitamins different veggies have in them and how that supports my health. my brain: Hello tomato with lycopene and vitamin C to help my heart and immune system."

It did show me I have more HAES people in my circles then I ever knew, with some of the content they are spouting. I really didn't realize quite how widespread it was until some of science colleagues started chiming in. I'm legit concerned it's killing people and not as fringe as I thought it was."
loseit,fdoxkir,t1_fdnpld7,1578615175.0,"You absolutely can! 

I am of the thought that so many diets fail for people because they take soooo much effort, are fad and a little crazy and restrictive, to the point where it FEELS impossible. Then we lose our confidence that we can be successful. The beautiful truth is that we just need to consume less than we expend over time, in whatever way works for us. You've got this."

loseit,fdnnl61,t3_emb8on,1578589514.0,"I hope you are proud of your new athletic regimen. It sounds very healthy and you've noticed being less out of breath, which is great healthy feedback.

Also, I agree with you - you shouldn't have to put in crazy amounts of effort without results, so find out where to tweak that effort to see them. 

The reality is you need to be consuming less than you expend to lose weight. It's all about that food. If daily tracking seems too daunting, why not try tracking everything you eat for just two weeks to get a reality check of calories? It may surprise you (as it did for me and so many of us here).

You seem so committed to health that with some easy changes you've got this!"

fatlogic,fdhc07q,t1_fdgy2eo,1578419680.0,"I've lost a lot of good friends through this. It sucks, and I'm sorry you are hurting. 

I didn't realize I was a gal you could always invite to brunch and count on indulging with you. Or going out and staying out a bit too late because I didn't have a gym session early the next morning. I could be counted on to accidentally mutually enable! 

I'm no longer as spontaneous or fun as I used to be (I'm even cutting back caffeine now), but I am reaching my longer term goals and I'm overall more content with myself. I'm also okay with being a bit more judgemental with understandment - fat enabling isn't okay. It's okay if people in my life were judging my choices as bad and with concern when I was heavier - they were! Any guilt I have ever felt watching someone eat super healthy has always been on me, just like her guilt is on her."

I saw her recently and she's gone full blown into books, podcasts and not just diet culture but now all dieting itself is toxic?!? She's watched me lose so much weight, what does she think I'm supposed to make of these claims. I'm a literal example of how amazing and life changing it has been. Oof.

I do so much better with health goals with a group, so I'm happy to be part of yours for the next couple of months. I personally think so many of us unfortunately excel at being our own inner bully and I'm learning to be a better cheerleader for myself.
