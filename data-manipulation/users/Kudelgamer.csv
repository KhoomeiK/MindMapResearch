socialanxiety,fdk6z6y,t1_fdjvi6d,1578497500.0,"Same, I think its because when you have anxiety for a long time, it gets worse and you get anxiety for more things. Its because our brain tells us there is danger too fast and it gets worse"

socialanxiety,fcxwpy7,t1_fcxwgen,1578071590.0,Through the therapy I had to talk to my parents but I never tell them anything unless I really need something and I use everything as a excuse. I feel like someone trying to be sad when I talk about it
socialanxiety,fcvn6vl,t1_fcvn5hu,1578005717.0,That escalated quickly my bad just had to
socialanxiety,fcvn5hu,t1_fcvka75,1578005693.0,"Nice from you man, im just being kind to everyone dont have anything in my life except family so why not help people I guess. I dont allow myself to cry and be sad so I do this. I cant even write normal texts . Im just ruining my childhood im 16 btw. Meanwhile my brother has a burnout and gets all the attention because everyone knows what a burnout contains. My family really supports but im sure they no nothing about social anxiety and depression and I hate it. They can good job but it means nothing to me since I know they dont know how it feels. They worst thing is that everytime I do something I find a way to stop and be negative. Last week I was drumming 24/7 but today I went to the fysio (dont know what it is in english) basically just basic workout  with a guy that helps people. And I was kinda tired after and decided to not drum for a bit. Then i decided that I had to record a drum cover today but I was tired so it went shit and I put my kit for sale and got mad at everyone in the house. My dream is to become a big youtube drummer but after a few videos I just stop since I cant handle the pressure I put on myself and after I stop I get really depressed. I also have a therapist for a year but its only talking and I have a felling its fking bullshit. Anyways if u read all this you are a great person, dont know ehat im doing anymors but thanks, you are a great human"
socialanxiety,fcv29j5,t1_fcv1sig,1577993148.0,"Hmm, I dont think you need to know every detail it will only make it harder. I think if you know less you would still need to do everything need to do to lose social anxiety but youre just less depressed."
socialanxiety,fcv1uvn,t1_fcv0vk8,1577992902.0,Thanks for telling me. And good for you man hope you succeed and that you will be happy about it. Do j still have anxiety? Or are you here just to help peolle? :D
socialanxiety,fcuzhqp,t1_fcuz8kh,1577991605.0,"Nope, and I realise all those things but I have just way to much time in a day to overthink stuff. I cant be happy with anything because I will find multiple reasons why something isnt perfect."
socialanxiety,fcuz9l5,t3_ej0s1h,1577991478.0,"Im 16 and have the same, its so fucked up, and to be honest I dont like that many people have it. I dont allow myself to be sad because I think like; many people have it, so it isnt special or some people have it worse such as kids that are sick or getting bullied ver bad. Sorry for my shitty english"
socialanxiety,fcuymyu,t1_fcux9yq,1577991135.0,"Thanks a lot for your response man, I really cant think of a way that it will inspire me, but I guess it takes time, may I ask what kind of thing you where doing? Just curious, if its private its fine ofcourse."
socialanxiety,fcuvdpp,t3_eixgaz,1577989317.0,I just see it as another thing to hate myself
socialanxiety,fcuv253,t1_fctw9gx,1577989118.0,Right now I have a therapist and it sound very true im already 1 year in with no progress and we pretty much only talk and Rarely do something. Right now Im really doubting to stop it anyways I dont actually know what im doing and why im writing this. Have a nice day
socialanxiety,fcttiem,t1_fcsqosm,1577958710.0,"It feels easy after, when you need to go to the store for example you could get really anxious but when it goes right, you think afterwards why was I scared this was easy"

socialanxiety,fcni5an,t1_fcn3d8b,1577812190.0,"You have to fail if you want to win. You cant just give up, its so hard but if you just keep talking you will sometimes say something stupid but when you do say something good and you get a good response you have to celebrate it a bit and think about that you did a great job. If u only remember the bad things it wont really help. It sounds easy but it isnt i still have social anxiety myself but this helps"
socialanxiety,fcmpfg0,t1_fcmlfn9,1577785688.0,"Sorry if I say something stupid, but have you ever thought of a therapist? Im 16 and I have social anxiety and I have a great therapist that has helped multiple people with social anxiety + addiction and maybe you can try it depending on where you live. Anyways good luck and have a nice last day of the year"
