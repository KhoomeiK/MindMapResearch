You seem to be using drug use as a primary metric in your arguments, which I do not concede as valid - plenty of people use drugs without significant impact to their health (I am one of them).  I also find your use of ""drug crime"" as a metric to be flawed, at least without further clarification - many more drug related crimes go unreported in strictly illegal countries due to that illegality - being robbed during a deal, for example, has no legal recourse in these localities.

changemyview,fetrffw,t1_fetn6mk,1579378896.0,"I would argue that legalization is the much more nuanced path when compared to criminalization, then.  Legalization allows an entire legal framework of restrictions and regulation to be placed around these substances, rather than criminalization simply assigning penalties to activities associated with the substances and leaving market dynamics entirely confined to the black market.  Legalization encompasses approaches from strict, perscription only schemas to laissez-faire unregulated markets.

Your post mentions ""full legalization"", which without further clarification I'm taking to roughly mean ""allowing recreational purchase by adults"".  Even under this schema there is a lot of room for nuance - what is the minimum age of purchase?  How much can be purchased at once?  Etc.
