depression,fes1lzx,t3_eqcyvg,1579360511.0,It really makes me sad that posts that straight forward say that life will suck for the rest of your life are allowed and posts that say that life is hard right now but don’t give up are removed on a daily basis.

depression,feneboz,t3_eq0um9,1579282857.0,"Everything has its own time. Some people may have their break through today and others may have it in 10 years, but everyone has their own time and their own life and different struggles they’re going through. It must be hard to feel like you are on the sideline watching everyone’s success, but one day those you were watching and cheering on will do the same back to you when you have the energy and progress to succeed in something important to you."

depression,feejtu1,t1_feeikw6,1579035201.0,"Thank you, also the weirdest part about all this is that the body gets so God damn used to it that I feel terrible when I try to calm myself down and actually be myself. It’s like if someone would give you placebo, but your body expects to react in a certain way - so it does, the same happens around people, the body just switches instantly because it’s engraved in the mind. Believe me when I say that I will stay in bed for three days in a row, ready to die inside my mind and as soon as a friend rings on my door I become Beyoncé on stage. The problem is that if this is a normal thing to people with depression, it may become very dangerous  to not be able to spot who of your friends are going through a lot."
depression,feeihnw,t3_eojiuf,1579034426.0,"Wow this really speaks to me and I’m thankful you brought this subject up. I don’t know how to explain this in a good way, but I notice that as soon as I leave my door I have an absolutely weird coping mechanism that when I’m around others, I instantly smile, get all hyped up and talk way too much. My brain makes me believe I’m having an amazing time and when I come home I just think “what the hell did just happen”, it’s like I’d rather want to be a completely different person from me than to have people see me all being me. It’s like I’m blacked out, but I remember everything while I’m in the moment."

alcohol,fe8xpu1,t3_enxv0y,1578932126.0,"This actually happened last week. I was drunk out of my mind and was driven home by my friend. Got up to the second floor entrance where we have a door with a code. No one was home, I had no keys to the first floor (ended up finding them in my backpack the next day) and was absolutely too drunk to type in the code to the entrance. Got really pissed and destroyed everything in my way in the first floor and found the ladder downstairs. Climbed up the ladder, but it was not long enough for me to reach the second floor. Ended up throwing up to the second floor all my makeup in the middle of the winter and somehow sobered enough up to open the entrance door on the second floor. It’s not my craziest because I have ended up somehow peeing in the highway and totally blacking out for several hours, french kissed everyone at a party (was a bet with a friend), but I honestly don’t remember too much."
alcohol,fe8v3cm,t3_enzf89,1578931270.0,"I love wine, but I only drink red wine with cola and white wine with sprite. Try out mixing it with stuff. In general it’s much easier to drink alcohol around other people, try to drink with friends."
depression,fdz740l,t3_emnl5m,1578787321.0,"We’ll have to agree to disagree. Watched a family member deteriorate over several years to cancer and then watching them die in front of my eyes and wouldn’t wish that upon anyone. Wanting cancer instead of mental illness JUST because you are too self conscious to own that you have depression is actually fucked up. I will prolly receive a lot of hate for being so direct, but as a person who myself has had on and off major depressive episodes over the past year, that is not even comparable to having cancer. Crying all night, sleep all day or stay awake for days, big appetite or no appetite for weeks, pain in my whole body, a whole fuck ton of emotions and several months where I don’t feel shit and chronically suicidal is something I’d wish this person who passed away from cancer to go through instead of not being physically able to eat when they were very hungry and thirsty, throwing up all day, sleeping constantly, body aching as hell, 39 pills a day just to be able to somehow function 15% and directly dying without very painful and hard treatment is so fucking bullshit and I’m actually fucking pissed that this thread was recommended to me in my email because I’d prolly have a half decent night without reading this. At the same time I know how depression works and I don’t blame you for making such a little thought through comparison... My loved one hadn’t even energy to actually tell people what was going on with her so she couldn’t actually “just tell her work that she was going to be away to get chemo”. She sat and fucking worked on her fucking computer at the hospital while receiving her God damn chemo. You don’t directly die from depression. I haven’t received treatment for months and and I’m as alive as I don’t want to be, but you directly die from having cancer. I understand that maybe you are suicidal, but I feel like it’s almost glamorizing a deadly disease by saying that you’d rather want to have x instead of y that has ripped children away from their parents and ripped their parents away from their children."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fdy341t,t3_en3sku,1578775536.0,"Hey man, I’m so sorry for what you have to go through and just want to let you know that I really care for you and what you are going through. It seems to me that you have a lot on you shoulders at the moment, but please know that we care for you and there’s just one person calling you an idiot who has fucked up and that is yourself. Please understand that absolutely no one else thinks that about you and you seem like a genuinely loving and caring person despite the struggles you face. We all in this group have fucked up God knows how many times, and I have done it so many times that I have no hair left on my body to count in on, but that doesn’t mean that we are bad people, it only means that we have a lot to worry about and we have all found a harmful way to handle it. It must be really painful to trust someone so much and then get rejected in such a careless manner, but some people are major assholes and luckily you saw her true colors before it would be too late. It must be hard to believe me or take my words to heart, but you really only deserve love and warmth in your life and I’m personally sorry you haven’t been able to experience it. Don’t give it, your time will come and know that you can contact me if you want to talk."
Drugs,fdxz2co,t1_fdsu5ve,1578774344.0,Making him stop when he starts to change sound like a very late time to start setting boundaries. At that point he may have brain injuries that causes those changes or he may have developed a bigger addiction.
Drugs,fdxx214,t3_en10xp,1578773827.0,"Because of the major harms that weed may cause to the brain of a kid under development, and also other people in general, I would absolutely forbid my child of any drugs until they are 18 and can make their own decisions. But as other comments are saying, making him stop completely will prolly not happen so negotiation would maybe be better. I’m not gonna tell you what to do since I’m not in your shoes, but having an open and safe relationship with communication may be a good way to start. When I became 18 I started opening up to my mom and the way she reacted and treated me and my wishes with respect helped me build a strong bond to her and I could trust her with my life (not that I didn’t before that). At the same time he should still have boundaries, let him know that weed isn’t “the shit” and that you really don’t like that he is doing this and that he is hurting you by doing it. This is important so that he doesn’t feel that smoking weed is right “because my parent allowed me to”. Also he should consider getting other friends, maybe he could get into different hobbies and get to know other people. When he’s busy with other things he won’t have time to smoke and if you’re very concerned for him, you can call him and ask how he’s doing when he hangs out with his friends. This is a tactic my mom used on me when I was 14-18 and drank alcohol on parties, my mom always called between 23-01 in the night, which is when I would usually be at my drunkest and because of this I always had to watch out to not get too drunk. Let him know that if he doesn’t respect you back and doesn’t listen to you that you will set boundaries and that his behavior will have consequences. 
Just to get it out there before I receive massive hate, I am a huge weed lover and can go on binges for weeks so I’m personally not against weed in any way, but I would not be the same person or have the same respect for drugs if I started to smoke at the age of 15."
Drugs,fdkc3ut,t3_eltfzb,1578500735.0,"Did the same thing after my grandmother passed away from cancer. I was really depressed and it helped somewhat at my lower points after her passing away. She had some benzos left, not proud of it, but the medicine would have gotten thrown out and no one was ever interested about where it was."
Tinder,fc7px41,t1_fc09wiz,1577515567.0,"Exactly. I know of way too many situations where this has happened. It’s kind of disrespectful to assume that you have first priority of someone’s body because you invested a couple of hours on someone. If I was in the same situation as in the pic, I’d be devastated if someone didn’t see beyond the fact of what they can do with/to me. Especially when op mentioned that it was a waste of time listening to someone’s thoughts and ideas. Better to cut someone off than lead them on making them think that you actually do care."
Tinder,fc03dff,t3_efda69,1577276577.0,"I understand where you’re coming from, but tbh it’s really frustrating when I become just friends with someone over Tinder and they hate me after I tell them that Im not into them. I feel like people almost expect to get together just because you swipe right. Tinder have said themselves that it’s an app where people can meet not only a partner, but also friends."
