pcgaming,fdm5d6t,t3_el6qja,1578540190.0,I've been putting some serious time into the Witcher 3. I played the game and beat it when it originally came out but never played the expansions. So I've restarted the whole game. Also playing Transport Fever 2. I've never played a game like this one before and I'm really enjoying it. I was worried because I could never get into games like cities: skylines. Lastly I picked up GTFO and it's hard... Still haven't completed the first level but there is only 2 of us.

RighteousGemstones,fd17cox,t1_fcxog86,1578128276.0,I think the Mike Tyson tattoo case is different because the film studio put the tattoo on someone else's face. Mike Tyson should not need permission but that permission was given when the artist put the tattoo on his face.
RighteousGemstones,fd16zmf,t1_fcxnsi3,1578128143.0,What's crazy to me is that fact that it's on your body but you don't own rights to it? That seems absurd. When the tattoo artist puts it on your body that should be implied that you have all rights to that artwork.
