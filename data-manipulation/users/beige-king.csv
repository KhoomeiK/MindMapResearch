My step dad told me after she died that she had a special ringtone for me so when/if I called when she was sleeping she would be able to answer it.  I have a lot of anxiety attacks when I try to sleep, she was always there for me even if she couldn't physically be there.  She supported me and was enthusiastic about what I was interested in, and would also take a personal interest in it herself so we could talk about it.  She wrote me letters when we fought to tell me how much she loved me and how proud she was of me.  She talked openly about her mental disorders, it made me comfortable coming to her when I was experiencing things of my own, but when I wanted to be there for her and for her struggles she said she was a big girl and she'd be okay... Unfortunately she ended up taking her own life and I wish I could have been there for her more, like she was for me.  I really miss my best friend."

She was abused as a kid by her step dad, her mom is a schizophrenic, and used drugs.  My mom was dragged across the country until my grandma attempted suicide and then my great grandma came and picked her and her brother up and raised them until my grandma got back home.  She has 3 half siblings, 2 of which didnt even treat her like a sister.  She married my dad at 18, he was 32.  She had my sisters and I and my parents fought a LOT. My dad was mean and abusive during the fights but so was she and then she moved out and he kept us from her for a year because he was hurt that she left.  She met my step dad and everything was ok.  She suffered from constant migraines.  Diagnosed bipolar, depression, anxiety.  Got a gastric bypass surgery and then lost a bunch of weight and her depression increased.  Last 3 years of her life she was paranoid, and she turned to drinking. Cheated on my step dad attempted suicide so many times was arrested so many times for her drinking. She ran off so many times where we were afraid she was going to be found dead... Until one day she left and drove her car into an incoming semi and killed herself.  I can't say for certain what happened that caused everything to happen like it did, but I know that even though she was undiagnosed, she had schizophrenia like her mom and she was trying to run from it.

I crochet to keep the anxious and bad thoughts away.  I take medicine too.  I know from therapy I can't blame myself, but I just can't help it sometimes.  I was there the day she took off and I didn't stop her. I didn't try to stop her I watched her leave."

I took on the guilt of not seeing my mom often, of realizing she missed out on things and I would stay up all night crying and feeling terrible that my dad didn't know what to do with me.  Some nights I would call her and just beg her to forgive me for the things that I had no control over.  I wasn't properly diagnosed until 7th grade, but looking back at it now I see how unstable I was. Maybe I'd be better with my mental disorders now if I was diagnosed as a child but who knows.  I do remember an instance though that I screamed 'I'm going to commit suicide' to my dad because he asked me to do something minor and I thought it was unfair, I was about 10 years old.  Where I heard about suicide from? No idea. We didn't have a computer, so it must have been the news.
