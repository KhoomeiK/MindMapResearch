* Movies that no studio wants to make because they are highly unoriginal or have major script problems (like ***6 Underground***).

People might still be bringing good TV shows to Netflix (which is getting iffy with all the new streaming services needing content so Netflix is no longer the only game in town), but with 5 major studios and a dozen smaller outfits like Lionsgate and A24 any decent script/package is going to be offered to them FIRST with **no exceptions.**

People in the film business want to not just get PAID, but most of them still want to also get RICH. They want that big payday that comes with having a hit. Any potential franchise is going straight to the majors.

Just to be clear, what he did was to **manufacture evidence.** That should be an instant, permanent lifetime ban from ever being an officer. Make no mistake, somewhere down the line he is going to give false testimony or make up evidence when it's going to matter."
savedyouaclick,fcvil7v,t3_ej3bth,1578002856.0,"The No. 1 answer is pretty simple: the US doesn't have the same connection to *The Great War* as we do for WW II. 

* America did not enter until late in the conflict, 1917 after it had been going on for about 3 years already.
* America was only in it for about 18 months compared to the 4 years for everyone else. 
* The U.S. homefront was nowhere near as involved in the war effort during ""The War to End All Wars"" as it was 1942-45. As just two examples, not a single new civilian car or metal child's toy was produced during WW II as those industries had been converted to produce war supplies.
* The American military hierarchy did not control operations as it did in WW II. 
* Total number of U.S. troops involved was 4 million. In contrast, 16 million served in WW II.
* Of the 110,000 deaths, nearly half (45,000 est.) were from the Spanish Flu. 30,000 died before they even got to France. In WW II there were 405,000 deaths and 671,000 wounded.

All of these things contributed to WW II having a personal connection to almost every single American family. 

There's one more obvious reason, which is that there are just more stories to tell in WW II than WW I.  The conflict was truly global, with war fronts in Europe, Asia, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. And during & after it happened, American cinema was still at it's peak. After WW I, movies wouldn't even have ***sound*** for another 10 years. Radio was still the dominate storytelling form."

*Three* is all that's left. I wonder when everyone will finally address the elephant in the room when it comes to ""Mayor Pete."" Because if there's one candidate who would definitely lose to Trump it's him. He would energize the Republican base like no one in history."

But Castro has been an also-ran for almost his entire candidacy.  He had virtually no national recognition and one of the thinnest resumes of those running. What he should have been doing is gearing up to run for US senate against Cornyn. He has a much better shot at that, especially opposed to Beto."
netflix,fcs2k05,t1_fcox2v3,1577910508.0,"They are far from an ethical company. They are EXTREMELY secretive about viewing numbers, which means they can negotiate with OC creators in bad faith and keep them from getting their rightful full value. And from all reports, the culture inside the company is really stressful. 

CBS can put anything they want on CBS All Access, the FCC has no authority when it comes to any streaming service. So it will be interesting the next couple of years to see what comes out of all theses services as they take chances attempting to get subscribers."
