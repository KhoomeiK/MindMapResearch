Israel reclaimed land their communities were expelled from by Jordan’s illegal occupation in 1948-1967 and then some, but Israel gave back the Sinai and offered a peace deal for Jordan and Egypt for West Bank and Gaza, but they did not accept. These countries simply chose “no peace” for all the land because their extermination attempt failed, their pride was hurt, and then launched yet another war 6 years later and lost again.
And still. Israel gave up Gaza and is going to give 2/3rds of West Bank to the PLO if the death of their leader’s successor doesn’t result in a Hamas takeover of the region."

worldnews,ffotvdf,t1_ffo8c8s,1580081755.0,"No. It’s been religious originally. Both in the Middle East and in Europe. Jews were expected to follow Mohammed and they did not, so Mohammed claimed that the Bible has been corrupted by Jews and invalid religious text, and the Quaran is the pure holy book direct from God. 
Christians were obsessed with invalidating Judaism and would have religious debates that led to all sorts of violence including the Spanish Inquisition. And the Jews would have been spared. If only they converted. 

Only when this Aryan race mythology entered Europe did it become about ethnicity. The belief that white Aryans had God-like powers but lesser races have mixed with the German people making Germans only lowly-humans, and this can be undone by breeding pure Aryans with other Pure Aryans over a few generations. Anyone even a quarter semite is too impure racially.
