nextfuckinglevel,ff9671b,t1_ff8yso3,1579705787.0,"Sorry for the bad question. what i wanted to say is that the study of our universe seems to have just begun and no one knows what will be found out in the age of quantum computing and artificial learning. 

Of course it is possible that the uncertainty principle is so fundamental that no matter how much things develope that nothing will break through it, but to be honest my understand is way too shallow on these subjects to have any reasonable opinion. But i wanted to express it anyway because im still very much interested in these topics."
nextfuckinglevel,ff8yg2f,t1_ff7lu2h,1579700082.0,"In Rick and Morty there's this episode where Rick has a universe inside his car battery where the lifeform on one of the planets are used to generate energy for it.

But then one of those citizens who happens to be a genius scientist also creates a universe inside a small box that in turn generates energy for them (this goes on at least one more universe-level deeper), so rick has to go inside his car battery-universe because it stopped generating energy for him. 

This show is so good, don't understand why it got negatively meme'd by the internet."
