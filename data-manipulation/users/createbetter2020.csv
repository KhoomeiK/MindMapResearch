Fitness,ffpamci,t3_eugx4w,1580090299.0,Different kinds of workouts for different types of runners. If they don’t like it they can find a new track as far as I’m concerned. As long as you’re staying in your own lane so to speak they really don’t have a right to judge
NotionSo,ffm1lo4,t1_ffm1frl,1580047138.0,"No, I have one workspace. Inside I have two main pages that I call my dashboards. One says “Personal” and the other says “work”. Everything is stored under one of those two in a hierarchy format."
NotionSo,ffm0ypv,t3_eu6w3x,1580046764.0,I have 2 dashboard under the same account. Everything Business related is stored under the Business one and personal is with personal. What you’re asking is not possible to my knowledge
Brogress,ffh3fd0,t3_ethx3q,1579922049.0,Damn man look at that smile! Killing it bro keep it up
DecidingToBeBetter,ffgn8zb,t1_ffgn4z6,1579910188.0,"Totally. Some people think it can’t work but honestly you both get time to come up with exactly what you want to say. No name calling, no screaming. Generally just more respectful. Unless one party wants to be disrespectful lol"
Fitness,ffgn39u,t3_etiu36,1579910079.0,"Honestly man, worry about yourself. Do legs when you’re not together or tell him “today’s leg day join me if you want”. When you’re making gains he’ll jump on the gain train with ya"
DecidingToBeBetter,ffglyut,t1_ffgg1vt,1579909317.0,"Yup exactly what u/soyyoh said. We’ve talked it out but she tends to get very knee-jerk reactive and defensive. After trying to discuss in person a few times I find it’s easier to explain my feelings to her in writing, where she can absorb, reflect and understand more plainly."
DecidingToBeBetter,fffww3p,t1_fffwb87,1579893577.0,I appreciate the kind words!
DecidingToBeBetter,fffqgcz,t3_etdta6,1579889573.0,"Jeez. This is really nice. 

Currently writing a note to my wife about some issues we’re having. This hit hard. I hope you can find what you’re looking for my friend"
minimalism,ffdrpnl,t3_et06m8,1579827284.0,"You could get hinges and L-brackets or something and make a platform that folds up into the wall. Fold it up and put your monitor and keyboard away when you’re not using it. Paint it the same color as your wall and you’ll never notice it

Edit just finished reading and looks like this wouldn’t work for you since you don’t want to clean it up all the way. If you really wanted to diy it and if you own your home you could route cables through the wall wherever it is and plug all your peripherals into it and have them stored in another room somewhere."
Fitness,ff8tc1j,t3_esajch,1579695324.0,"All I know is when I was supplementing with caffeine and yohimbine every day I wanted to f*ck, like, all the time. Other than that I noticed no actual physical effects lol. Hope that helps"
omad,fentbne,t1_fent7tw,1579290504.0,I’m totally with you. Thanks for looking out
omad,fenspra,t1_fenrbc9,1579290147.0,"this is very clearly unhealthy. 7 day fasts for several months and looking for “fast weight loss” by consuming less than 400 calories a day is most definitely an eating disorder. Fasting has its benefits but there is not a single person well versed in this field that would recommend this as a sustainable, effective or even smart strategy. Sure they may lose weight fast, but they’re also teaching their brain and body that food is the enemy and that they don’t need it to survive. I can almost guarantee that after they reach their target weight they will not attempt to consume 1500 calories daily after what I would assume is months of this gigantic deficit. 

I applaud your patience in trying to help this person but I wouldn’t waste anymore effort."
NotionSo,fenrotr,t1_fenrh21,1579289773.0,"Agreed. Anyway not bashing notion or anything, it’s just clear it’s not ready to handle the full scope of a Business’ needs such as mine, especially at that price point. For now I’ll stick with personal and add guests as necessary, and for collaboration I’ll stick with google drive."
DecidingToBeBetter,fenr2ei,t3_eq438c,1579289613.0,"Baby steps, my friend. Focus on one thing at a time and break that thing into the smallest pieces you can imagine. You’ll get there"
NotionSo,fenqviy,t1_fenqsp9,1579289514.0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/NotionSo/comments/epu8zi/possible_security_issue_public_pages_available/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Edit: looks like the pages have to be marked public too, so that’s comforting at least"
NotionSo,fenm4n6,t1_fenlx7h,1579287628.0,"That is one of them, yes. Additionally there was a post earlier that indicated that if you share a page with someone, when they do a spotlight search on their account they have access to all of your pages which sounds like a big but definitely concerning. Notion has also indicated that all notion employees have full access to your workspaces. 

Don’t get me wrong I love the tool and will keep using it, but it’s with hesitation that I give it access to my Business information"
NotionSo,fenhjgv,t3_eq38ea,1579284823.0,"Yeah I’m totally thrown off by their pricing too. They aim their product at businesses but have so little regard for security in their application and the pricing makes it impossible for me to justify with the lack of functionality they still have to address. 

The way I see it is I can put what info I’m comfortable with having available to all Notion employees up under one personal account and give my team the password and pay $5/month, or I can pay $64/month to be able to give everyone their own accounts... since I can’t even put everything up there due to security the answer is pretty clear lol"
NotionSo,fengr84,t1_fengmz4,1579284340.0,Lol I love that it was intentional. That’s awesome
DecidingToBeBetter,fenf45c,t3_eq2l5y,1579283337.0,"Honestly start by reading just 10 pages a day. They shouldn’t be absorbed quickly anyway so you can reflect on what you read. after 10 pages decide if you want to continue, and commit to another 10 if so. It may just be that the books that you’re reading suck. What books are they? I might be able to make some recommendations. 

The subject is pretty dry but when you spend the time thinking about how you can apply the knowledge that’s where they get interesting."
NotionSo,fencm3b,t1_fen8kgc,1579281816.0,"Dang coffee then wake up that’s impressive!

Jokes aside this sub is awesome because of people like you helping out!"
GetMotivated,fekuhsk,t1_fekqqrd,1579207860.0,Lol wrong subreddit for this apparently
GetMotivated,feknhsa,t1_feknaxd,1579203723.0,Like a business license? One of those runs $100 in my state
