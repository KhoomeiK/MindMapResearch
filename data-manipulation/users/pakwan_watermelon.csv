MentalHealthPH,fdjun6w,t3_ebpx4k,1578488061.0,"Totoo ito. I decided I want to change my doctor kasi pakiramdam ko hindi naman ako nagi-improve dun sa gamot na nirereseta sakin for 2 years tsaka hindi na ako kumportable sa kanya. Nagrerelapse na ako that time kaya ako nagdecide na magpacheck up sa iba. Doon sa bago kong doctor, pinalitan niya kagad gamot ko kasi, may iba pa naman daw medication hindi lang iisa pwede din na combination.  Yun nga lang nung napalitan, lumala ako. Pero pinalitan din yung gamot, may in-adjust sa dosage, may dinagdag. Sa ngayon mas okay naman na state ko. Kino-continue ko pa din meds at checkups.
Medyo awkward sakin nung nagpalit ako ng doctor kasi, uulitin ko na naman na ikwento and sabihin kung ano ba nangyayari sakin. Pero after 2 sessions naman, naging kumportable na ako sa kanya. Bale combination ng medication tsaka therapy ang ginagawa sa akin ngayon."

AskReddit,fdfzy5a,t3_ekzpvd,1578375094.0,have i finally ceased to exist?
depression,fdfwzse,t3_el170m,1578372504.0,"yes haha. I think mine is stemming from looking for a connection with my friends because in our family we can't communicate well (living in a country where living with parents is common).  
It's sad to be always initiating the conversation, but I think it's good also because I've become self-aware of this behavior. When I realized that, I stopped initiating the conversation. Now, I have little friends left that checks up on me hahah"
offmychest,fd1h3cm,t1_fd1goii,1578131303.0,thanks for the info
offmychest,fd1e9zq,t3_ejqq3u,1578130352.0,I've been taking multiple psychiatric meds too and I'm scared of this possibility happening to me. What meds are you taking?
depression,fd13qrv,t3_ejnao7,1578127207.0,"Yes, if you are a people pleaser like me. I tend to be hyper aware of these things because I worry that people might perceive me as weak, dramatic or a ""toxic"" person and we're afraid that they might not be friends with us after that. Also, we're accustomed to be the one hearing other people's problems."
CasualPH,fcv387i,t1_fcv2rwa,1577993724.0,Thank you.

depression,fcux9nk,t3_eizsdo,1577990372.0,"Thank you for voicing out these things that, for the longest time, were on my thoughts. I know and have felt what you mean. From where you are now, I have questioned myself too before that there must be something wrong with me. ""I KNOW that I should be grateful for what I have because others have bigger and complicated problems than me, that I should feel my family's love and concern but why can't I feel it? That makes me a horrible person right? because I can't feel the good things I'm supposed to feel"".
I felt so frustrated at myself. I felt hopeless that things will get better. But things do get better, little by little. Sometimes I did not even realize it like fact that I am writing about my feelings and sharing them with strangers on the internet now which, before, would be unthinkable of me to do. 
It is okay to feel the way you feel now but that does not mean you are the negative things you think you are. It is okay to feel frustrated, anxious, disgusted, angry, alone and hopeless at yourself but that does not dictate it would be what you're going to feel throughout your life. It is okay to feel these but things will get better. It's okay to take it slow and take steps back at times but it will be okay."
depression,fbqsvqj,t1_fbjzxef,1577035297.0,">unresolved anger and frustration at myself and those who I feel have abused me and contributed to who I have become

I feel this too and the word I use is blame. In my mind, I blame them for not knowing that their deeds have a negative impact on me. I blame myself for not speaking up at that time. But if I blame them, it felt like I do not have the right to and get angry at them because they don't know what they've done."
