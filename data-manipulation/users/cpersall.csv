dogs,ffn49er,t3_eu9vzr,1580061914.0,"Its normal yes, but to me just shows that dog parks are an issue. Honestly, its just asking for a fight, even if she's not really the one to blame. I would not take my dog to a dog park if this was happening."
AustralianShepherd,ffju9ou,t1_ffj5ogw,1580007113.0,There are plenty of even solid tri or bi x solid tri or bi litters that have mismarks like this. I wouldnt at all doubt that its not a double merle.
dogs,ffjtijk,t1_ffjqtn5,1580006526.0,I dont really know what to tell you other than try to see if they can get you in earlier if there's a cancelation or something. You really needed to have this taken care of before you ran out of his meds. Buying something to use from amazon could be fine to use and just useless or it could be dangerous to use without talking to your vet
dogs,ffjqixl,t1_ffjq0ym,1580004370.0,Right. Which means he needs to be seen by your vet. I have a 13 yr old dog on meds and it absolutely makes sense to bring him in to the vet regularly to make sure the dose is still working for him or if it needs to be reevaluted or a different med considered.
dogs,ffjphil,t3_eu02gp,1580003685.0,Or they want to make sure your dog is getting the med and dose that is correct for his needs and dont want to be responsible for giving you the wrong dose/info because they havent seen your dog recently. I really hate that people jump to vets needing money so they make you bring your dog in when its not necessary.
dogs,ffjjnqq,t1_ffjcy81,1579999741.0,"> YOU be the alpha dog....cuz then they can relax and follow without having the stress of being “in charge.” 

I would also encourage people to look for training help that is based on research and up to date. The advice to be the alpha dog is not up to date. Training is good, but using methods that are based on stuff that has been disproven can do just as much harm as not training at all."
dogs,ffjcpw1,t3_etym9z,1579995529.0,"Research breeds before buying. If buying from a breeder, make sure they're a reputable breeder."
dogs,ffixoqm,t1_ffixm7e,1579985259.0,That doesnt mean they are the same mix.
dogs,ffixkdi,t1_ffiiflx,1579985172.0,But you think your dog is the same mix as the other dog and you simply have no way to tell that.
dogs,ffihb8n,t1_ffig1e0,1579973866.0,They could be a mix of multiple breeds and the truth is that you dont know even if you have some guesses.
dogs,ffifqlh,t3_ettghr,1579972795.0,Dogs don’t stop shedding.
dogs,ffif9f4,t3_ettecm,1579972467.0,They are not necessarily the same mix even if they look similar. Genetics are much more complicated than that.
AustralianShepherd,ffid868,t1_ffhswwe,1579971093.0,Hearing issues can still be present. It’s also very important to make sure this is a reputable breeder. A reputable breeder would have already talked to you about the concerns based on color.
AustralianShepherd,ffid3b1,t1_ffhswmv,1579971002.0,No
dogs,ffhg9ea,t1_ffhfxof,1579933952.0,"I have Aussies and am active in the Aussie community and know the Aussie breeders around here. They do OFAs, well at least the reputable ones do. I’ve come to learn that collies have extremely low incidences of hip dysplasia and so some reputable breeders do not OFA hips. They will still need multiple other health clearances."
AustralianShepherd,ffhekdv,t3_etm947,1579932013.0,Nope. Iron guts.
dogs,ffh8k3v,t3_etm198,1579926193.0,There is no set time. You do you.
dogs,ffh6l6b,t3_etlo1r,1579924536.0,Hmm I'm in western canada and friends with multiple breeders who all do OFA's. What breeds are you looking at? Health clearances are a huge must but they will vary by breed.
AustralianShepherd,ffh3dlw,t3_etkma8,1579922012.0,"Yes that puppy would be considered a mismark with excess white on its head. The breeder should be doing a BAER test. If the puppy only has excess white but is not the product of a merle x merle breeding, it may have light sensitivity in the eye thats lacking pigment around it. You need to talk to the breeder about these issues. Please read the stickied post as well as the info on the sidebar to make sure you are buying from a reputable breeder."
dogs,ffgsxx7,t1_ffgoua3,1579914250.0,"> Unless you think that only the dogs of the correct Colour are the healthiest and nicest dogs then it's impossible for it to not be the case.

I dont think that. 

> Im not sure what you mean here?

You know what pick puppy refers to? So the dog would otherwise be pick puppy but isnt/cant be because its a DQ color/mismark. How often does that actually happen? 

> I'm against the current outdated standards

So what are your qualifications to determine that the breed standards are outdated and need to be rewritten? 

> There's a reason many working dog line breeders don't care about conformation shows or breed standards)

That is very incorrect. WL breeders may not enter conformation shows but they still very much care about breed standards. And I say this as a person who has a breed with both WL and SL and experience with breeders who have WL but care enough about conformation that they are actually breed judges. 

Again, you havent given me any kind of proof. You've given me your opinion, which is fine, but its based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how breed and breeding actually works. You arent giving me any information that would help to educate me in a way I'd change my opinion."
dogs,ffgn6zw,t1_ffgaze2,1579910151.0,"You’ve said it’s damaging but haven’t provided proof. Really, how many times would a dog actually be the pick puppy but isn’t because of color? And how can you really say that breed standards don’t need to exist for breeds to exist. You have not given me any reason to change my mind. So yes, my response continues to be so what until you can come up with something solid to back your opinion."
dogs,fffhpmd,t1_ffeqlyi,1579884205.0,Oh but I very much care about the health of breeds and if you have followed any of my comments on this sub over the years you would see that. But I don’t think you understand breed standards if you think they aren’t necessary to have breeds. That’s not a good way to try to convince me.
dogs,ffeib86,t1_ffehpp2,1579849154.0,I think people are harshly overestimating what effect it actually has on the gene pool.
dogs,ffeh3zs,t1_ffegu7v,1579847771.0,Yeah but so? I don’t think people who are arguing that point even understand.
dogs,ffeg55a,t1_ffee2b2,1579846712.0,I’m not a conformation person either. But you don’t need to be to understand breed standards and why they exist.
dogs,ffeg3p0,t1_ffef5l7,1579846669.0,"Yes, but my response to that is “so what?” What’s wrong with that? Color is part of breed type."
dogs,ffeg28n,t1_ffefjwk,1579846626.0,"> but there are a load of different genes etc that would be linked with colour that you're not allowing into the gene pool by not breeding them.

I’m sorry, I don’t understand. I think that’s exactly what I’m saying about breeds who don’t just allow any color? 

There’s nothing wrong with breeding fair rated hips. 

But think what defines breeds? Golden retrievers? If you saw a sable dog, you wouldn’t be “yep that’s a golden retriever.” What about a solid black dobe? You’d think it’s a mix breed. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a breed standard limiting what color it’s breed allows. Unless you’re completely going back to landraces, and even then to some degree, you’re going to be limiting gene pools. And there’s nothing wrong with limiting gene pools."
dogs,ffecpja,t1_ffeb9k0,1579843275.0,But what is wrong with limiting the colors in a breed even if there are no health issues related?
dogs,ffe9jcu,t3_et2ldo,1579840443.0,"Where is he from? Breeder? Shelter? I’m curious about how much of this is genetic fear issues. If breeder, have you talked to the breeder? Expressing anal glands is fear, not just a protective dog. You need the professional help of someone who uses up to date positive methods and who can help you with appropriate management."
dogs,ffe9b53,t1_ffe5uay,1579840255.0,I wouldn’t ever recommend someone who is a “balanced trainer” over a trainer who uses positive reinforcement for a fearful Aussie.
dogs,ffe8n5y,t1_ffe1ogb,1579839707.0,"There is good reason to limit color. Not only does it define breed type color is associated with health issues. Some colors/patterns can “hide” these other colors making is easy to mistakenly breed them. Breed standards are far from stupid. They are how the breed is defined. No breed standard means no breeds. And conforming to that standard is again not just part of defining breed type, it’s also related to health and a healthy structure for the dog. I don’t understand how that is remotely stupid."
