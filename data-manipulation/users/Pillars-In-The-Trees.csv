Bad things are always going to happen, and the only thing to do is to support the principles you believe in. Of course I don't like the idea of surveillance restricting our freedom.

I have not yet met my burden of proof for a Russian conspiracy theory. It's a great conspiracy theory, but it's not irrational to doubt the claims.

>The very idea that varied international news publications that are fact checked by the entire world and owned by a wide variety of people and organizations (including independent non profit publications) all collude in real time to smear Russia, is honestly so impossibly absurd that even a small amount of research debunks it immediately. 

I'm not claiming that? And they're not fact checked very well at all, in fact sensationalized news is very frequently wrong, and almost always politically slanted. Remember the live election polls? To say that they're colluding to smear Russia would be the same as saying they colluded to support Russia in previous years.

I'm saying that blaming Russian influence for the outcome of the 2016 American election is a very easy conclusion to gravitate towards considering how widely unpopular the candidate who was elected is/was.

>This doesn't even scratch the surface of the reality that all western intelligence agencies, all western governments, numerous independent think tanks, private cybersecurity firms, and independent journalists and industry experts have all come to the same conclusion.

That statement is meaningless. No they definitely have not come to the same conclusion, in fact they haven't come to any conclusion because they're still investigating.

> You need absolute unattainable proof that Russia does what all signs say they do, but you need little to no proof to believe the entire journalism profession intentionally is colluding to lie about little old Russia. That's not a rational position.

I think that the entire field of journalism is sensationalizing everything it touches, and I have no reason to believe this is any different.

>If that's your bar, the propaganda worked.

I honestly don't even know what to say to this one.

But yeah, if your answer is ""the proof's hidden"" then of course I'm not going to believe it. An opinion isn't automatically correct and rational just because it has a lot of support.

I think there's a lot of fearmongering going on, and Russia was an enemy of America not so long ago. Remember McCarthyism?"

I don't think it would be hard. I still require primary evidence before I'm going to just accept the conclusion though.

>Have you ever seen those silly gifs of very dumb craft projects? The company making those has direct links to the Russian government.

Okay I do have a problem with this statement however. Not only would this be extremely ineffective compared to simply leaving comments or the like, I'm extremely doubtful that anything close to a majority of those low effort videos come from any single source at all.

Originally I was/am skeptical because the number of people I see promoting Russian interference vastly outweighs the evidence I've seen. (I still intend to go through everything I've been sent in this thread, so maybe that'll change.)

From what I've seen so far, Russia's official position is that this is nonsense created out of thin air. Obviously they can't be relied upon to tell the truth, however I admit that I'm absolutely willing to believe that American media surrounding the current political situation will spin a yarn to stir up a frenzy, especially when this started shortly after the very unpopular current president was elected.

So no, I have absolutely no doubt that Russia or any other large entity has the capacity to do this, it's just that a lot of the discussion I had seen so far set off my bullshit alarm.

The whole point of trolling is to trick you into engaging with something that makes you angry. If someone holds an opinion, even if they believe something you think is ridiculous, you should look at how they present that opinion and how they got there, rather than your own reflexive response.

Also, if you manage to get in an argument with a bot, either AI has advanced much farther than anticipated or you're probably arguing about a subject you're pretty ignorant about.
