cats,ffnnuaj,t1_ffmqr3n,1580068301.0,You're absolutely right.  :-)
cats,ffmlojz,t1_ffmdbxb,1580056369.0,You are much better person than I.  My cats go wherever they please.  Our cats have even been known to sit on the dining table as we eat dinner. We're terrible people.
cats,ffmiu4k,t3_eu7td5,1580055362.0,I wonder too! Please follow up to let us know what their reactions are.
cats,ffkwid5,t3_eu3r5j,1580030273.0,Congrats! I'm so glad you found your kitty safe and sound. Plenty of cats that are indoor/outdoor kitties don't fare so well.  Cats do just fine as indoor only pets or catproofing a yard is doable. Before having our cats we had a couple of beagles and dog door for them. We're down to just 1 old beagle now and the cats quickly figured out the dog door so we catproofed the yard with netting. It was an effort but not difficult. It's a real relief knowing they're safe.

cats,ffgtiut,t3_etjisz,1579914674.0,"Yup, got one too."
politics,fffvd7t,t1_fffjcvc,1579892614.0,"Wrong place for my 2 cents in the middle of this convo, but to your point; I  believe the GOP Senators know they're on a sinking ship with or without Trump & as such are rats clinging to one another to stay politically alive. We've watched each of them defend the indefensible. Sometimes with lies, sometimes with complete disregard of truth, law or reasonable expectation of decorum.  The Republican party has been shrinking for years and would naturally go the way of the dinosaur within another generation, but they *won't* relinquish their power.  IMHO they are deliberately shredding democracy in order to install single party rule."
cats,fffqmkj,t3_etbawq,1579889680.0,A clear example of being 'long in the tooth'.

cats,ff4ngo2,t3_ermn24,1579567883.0,"Buy a pack of hair ties. They're cheap.  Shoot one across room and see what happens. I've spent a small fortune on cat toys, but nothing seems to entertain mine more than a hair tie."
PoliticalHumor,ff4kbwk,t3_eresuq,1579565693.0,"Just curious, is \*anyone\* impressed by the the Trump children's behavior?  Does it make Donald Trump seem more impressive to see his kids doing these things?  Looking for honest opinions."
