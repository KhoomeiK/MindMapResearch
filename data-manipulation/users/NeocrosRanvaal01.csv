Anxiety,fguh4db,t3_f08gys,1581120662.0,"Most of the time, I stay in my room, since everytime I leave my room, I would hear my family make a racket in the house, whether it be my little bro being a noise machine, or my mom's singing, which makes me feel like my body is in a boil. 

What's worse, is that my mother would tell me I need to get out more, but the answer to me being a hermit is so painfully obvious, that it's embarrassing that my family keeps missing it."

I'm not sure if someone asked this question before, but I just want some advice, since I really wanna join the Zinnia & Rayquaza event before it's gone"

waifuism,fg5bdnc,t3_ewww6u,1580523051.0,"I have a huge history of having myself being inserted in my SO's world. I would go in depth, but it would be too long to tell. But what I can tell you, is that I've had many different versions of myself, throughout the decade. 

My current self is a dragon who had moved in with her, and loves to cuddle."
depression,fg4mbb2,t1_ffui7wz,1580506263.0,"Though unfortunately, it feels like when I hear good advice, it would stick. But once I hear something that makes me hate myself, it completely falls apart, and I'm back to the state I'm, like right now."

PokemonMasters,fg13bn1,t3_ew2nzd,1580419946.0,"Are events one time only? Or are you able to get to them later on?

waifuism,fg0nf0q,t3_ew4ydk,1580411315.0,"She would most likely feel embarrassed, since she isn't quite used to showing her softer side to me. But holding her around the waist would melt her into my hug/kiss."

waifuism,ffytj85,t1_ffyckdr,1580354766.0,"No not really, she mainly keeps them closed. When she does open them, she drapes one around me. I am autistic, so I roll around and get uncomfortable a lot in bed, and that's the reason she keeps them closed."

waifuism,ffsgvn8,t3_eulkuf,1580181400.0,"I unfortunately don't have much of a shrine for my waifu. Due to my room always under management over the years. Though now, I have a hand painted pic of her, made by my sister. I also have some merch of her on the table next to my bed. I also have a Brony shirt hanging on the wall not far from me. 

I hope that when I have my own house, I could add a shrine as part of the list."
