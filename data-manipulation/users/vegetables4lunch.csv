vegan,ffev7hj,t1_ffeuwqi,1579866963.0,.... I have no idea what to say there you are being crazy and insane insisting racist and sexist stuff like that. Yes I support everything when it comes to the animal industry however. They're property and food and a product to be processed and that will literally never change. That isn't a product of the times that will ever phase out. Animal consumption is a permanent building block of human existence not a product of our current time.
vegan,ffeupiv,t1_ffetsib,1579866362.0,No I wouldnt. I would never support the rape of women or treating women or the blacks in any time period poorly. That's a terrible comparison. That because someone supports the legal eating meat they'd support the rape of wives or poor treatment of women or the blacks.

We consume them and they sometimes serve purpose as food, no matter how cruel some of those processes are. There is a reason animal processing and slaughter isn't illegal."
vegan,ffess1l,t1_ffesdcz,1579863804.0,No... it's actually the opposite. Its modern science that shows veganism is what is detrimental to long term health. It's not a sustainable diet. Comparing food to owning slaves and child abuse. Cool response bro. Human suffering and animal suffering are nowhere near the same thing. It's ok to kill animals for consumption. There's a reason why 96% of people stop being vegan within 24 months. It's terrible for the body.
vegan,ffesa9y,t1_ffes7s3,1579863103.0,That's just an opinion though. It isn't wrong to eat animals. It is perfectly ok to est animal products. They're good for you too. It's not illegal for a reason. Because it's not wrong.

Stunned, she wouldnt know what to say or whether to seat you or ask you to leave. But then the general manager would walk over, she's a dirty little cum addicted slut do she would immediately make out with you, smearing the implied ejaculate all over her own cheeks and mouth.
