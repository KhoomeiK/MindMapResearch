I think this is more likely a case where we're remembering a few recent instances which happen to be in Russia.

Edit: We are all victims to numerous biases.  Sometimes when we see 2 or 3 things in a short period of time, we put extra weight on the idea that there must be plenty more.  When we create a theory in our mind, (like more fireball sightings because there are more dash cams in Russia), we can become victim to a confirmation bias where we look back in our memory and any recent videos from Russia confirm the theory.  Our memories are flawed and when we want to believe something to confirm our theory, we'll remember what we want and forget the rest.  

The idea that since Russia is sparsely populated so you'll see more sightings is unlikely because 1. If you look at Russia on google maps, you can see that even if there are more dash cams being used, there are not a lot of highways and 2. Meteorites are usually bright enough to see when near populated areas.  On top of that, even though countries like the states has more highways and cities, there are still lots of less populated areas where you can see plenty of stars.

The premise that Russia has more fireball sightings is flawed.  [Looking over videos from this website](https://www.amsmeteors.org/category/fireball-sightings/), there doesn't seem to be any high frequency of sightings from Russia."

There were some media outlets that warned about a global cooling in the 70's but those were just media outlets.  ""A survey of peer reviewed scientific papers from 1965 to 1979 show that few papers predicted global cooling (7 in total). Significantly more papers (42 in total) predicted global warming""

""Quite often, the justification for the few global cooling predictions in the 1970s is overlooked.  Probably the most famous such prediction was Rasool and Schneider (1971):

""An increase by only a factor of 4 in global aerosol background concentration may be sufficient to reduce the surface temperature by as much as 3.5°K.""

Yes, their global cooling projection was based on a quadrupling of atmospheric aerosol concentration.  This wasn't an entirely unrealistic scenario - after all, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions were accelerating quite rapidly up until the early 1970s (Figure 2).  These emissions caused various environmental problems, and as a result, a number of countries, including the USA, enacted SO2 limits through Clean Air Acts.  As a result, not only did atmospheric aerosol concentrations not quadruple, they declined starting in the late 1970s

Similarly, if we now limit CO2 emissions, we can also eventually get global warming under control."""

There have been a lot of scientific experiments done to prove that human pollution is the cause of the rapid heating of our planet.
