Then they’d just do more science to figure out how this new system worked and then that would become all the new basis we used, and we don’t need the old stuff.

Because science isn’t about following old rules, it’s about constantly making new ones to fit the current knowledge and data."
relationship_advice,ffmsa0r,t3_eu5gfv,1580058340.0,"The reason I don’t like r/relationship_advice sometimes is because they always recommend you break up with someone full stop. As if the person you’re dating isn’t an adult with the ability to change themselves, or who doesn’t have feelings and we don’t care about them.

As some people mentioned above she is kinda still in the abusive relationship, though less impactful because she’s not living with him anymore. I think you should keep dating her, breaking up with her will likely send her back into his arms and she’d be in an abusive relationship all over again. 

In the meantime, keep expressing your concerns about her seeing him trying as best you can to keep yourself calm. She could definitely be hurt by this guy again, and I agree with you, she shouldn’t be seeing him. I still think the best thing you can do is a hands-off approach. I know that’s hard, but sometimes the best thing you can do for someone is to let them get hurt and be there to help them heal.

I hope you work through it"

nextfuckinglevel,ffced8q,t1_ffbdivf,1579797648.0,"As a musician who didn’t have to work super hard to be decent, I think of it like this. Learning a skill is learning the individual parts of how to do something, and each of those parts take a different amount of time for each person.

Using piano as an example. For some people they get lucky and the basics are super easy for them, how to read music, how to play scales, what hand position is correct, etc.

For others it takes more time to learn the basics but once they do they can excel at the more advanced stuff, how to make phrases, the minute differences in a performance that makes it truly exceptional, how to make it sound gorgeous, etc.

Putting in more work just makes you more likely to figure out how to do these things.

Learning music isn’t a linear process. If everyone put in the same amount of work every day they would be at different points by the end of the year, but there’s no way to generalize that result across a lifetime, because people struggle with different parts differently."

Look I admitted above “more heavily implicated” was a misstatement, but the fact that two Presidents of the United States is implicated at all is god awful.

Like I don’t like Clinton or Trump, they should both be prosecuted, but there is a much more clear line between Trump (he is head of the department that let Epstein die) than anything Clinton has (someone mentioned above: Clinton-> his step-dad -> The Dixie Mob -> ??? -> the people who killed Epstein).

“It was the Clintons (conveniently ignoring the fact that Donald Trump both was more heavily implicated, and that he literally heads the section of government that deals with prisoners. Also ignoring the fact that the Clintons are retired and only have jail time to be worried of, but they’re rich and have good lawyers so it’s not that big of a deal for them. Whereas Trump is running for re-election and if he got implicated it would be harder to separate public opinion from this scandal, and that if he lost re-election, he’d likely go to jail because of the Mueller reports allegations and other crimes he’s committed not related to Epstein) who killed Epstein.”"
