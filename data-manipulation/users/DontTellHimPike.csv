This made me think back to the dawn of digital media, PC's coming with CD re-writers and the record industries subsequent panic regarding home recording, DRM and Napster. One of the positions they took was that consumers don't own the music they buy and therefore copying an album onto a re-writable CD, even as a backup copy should be viewed as piracy. 

Well if you take their argument to its logical conclusion then it's the record industries responsibility to ensure the millions of secondhand CD's in the world that people are failing to sell do not end up buried in the ground. After all, the general public don't actually own them."
