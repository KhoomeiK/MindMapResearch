MadOver30,ffcmo0z,t3_esunvq,1579802703.0,"I was on the road to adulting, but some asshole triggered me as usual by violating my legal rights as it seems all shitty landlords and property managers do and it just made me not want to deal with people's shit any more and go back on meds to stop the madness.  Dealing with schizophrenia, thinking my neighbors are always talking about me, that the property managers are spying on me, and everything is too much plus people actually being dicks all the time. I just get to a dark place where I'm not interested in the world anymore and start rooting for the end of the world to happen.  It seems the end of the world is actually coming too, Australia literally on fire... Peace never coming in the middle east and global warming accelerating the weather change to the point where it will cause major upheaval. I look at the people who started families like oblivious hobbits, just stupid lower order animals that now have brought more children into a burning world and I just pity them. I think it's really those people 'adulting' who have it all wrong. The world is a train in initial process of wrecking and they're bringing on more passengers and thinking all the usual stops are going to happen."
abusiverelationships,ffckzyp,t3_esuh2e,1579801694.0,I'm surprised people like that can get a gun in Sweden.  After my second hospitalization I can't shoot or own guns for 5 years in California.
depression,ffcjvm7,t3_essxe0,1579801015.0,"I'm on anti-psychotics that reduce my psychosis, but cause depression.  It sucks knowing that I would have that energy, power and happiness if I didn't have to take meds for schizophrenia. Of course, a lot of that energy and power would be used to scream at entities that weren't actually there, break things, argue with voices, but the depression feels worse to me.  It is completely for the benefit of others that I take the anti-psychotics so I won't cause problems."

depression,ff3o9uf,t3_erb5ww,1579545312.0,"I hate that the karma here is not real karma, but dumb people probably think it is and give themselves real pats on the back for fake karma coming from judges which aren't fit to judge.  Like if everyone on here hates something, but they are still wrong to hate it, they'll still get a shitload of karma because people are societally wrong about things. For instance, if it were 1840 and someone posted something anti-black and most the people with the internet were anti-black so they dole out shitloads of karma for something evil."

schizophrenia,fekawmk,t3_ephilm,1579196232.0,"I respectfully disagree. Some people are in the baby step phase and need to hit those low bars before they can even think about hitting the high bars again. I do think we can stagnate though if we aren't encouraged to keep trying and progressing so positive, helpful encouragement helps as long as it doesn't come off as admonishment. There are also older ones who have tried and climbed back up the ladder so many times only to have fallen back off again that it is understandable that giving up is their most major hurdle and even wanting to try is their biggest first baby step."

There was the gold aviators, the red fake ray bans, the green and white fake raybans... I'm on antipsychotics now for schizophrenia and the meds also kill anger... until my body gets used to the drug and the rage comes back. There's always constantly switching meds because of this though."

depression,fdma4g1,t3_em24nt,1578543641.0,"You said it. Totally agree with you. You really hit the nails on the head. What incentive is there to be a worker? Low pay high rent high mortgage world with those on the top of the pyramid scorning everyone else. The youth would be better off learning survival skills acquiring weapons and going off the grid. All i read is sadness online. The sadness comes through as madness as well. It's the end of this soon though. I have a feeling. It seems like it's the end of the world. The return of Quetzalcoatl in 2012 didn't bring a literal flood end of the world it brought a flood of people who more and more are waking up who are sick of the evil old ways and are prepared to refuse it. It brings floods of immigrants and those who resist multiculturalism will be washed away. Ive seen Jesus alive and the writing on the wall, the big picture, the old ways will be washed away and people will finally be truly free. That's my dream and apparent unfolding prophecy. Good for you, to scorn those things. Bless you!"

I finished my BA, but I wonder if I'd been better off not going to college. My piece of shit dad would say i had to ""do something"" although i was already practicing guitar every day and playing in a band. Fuck college.

Reminds me of a funny story though when I was a kid we were all out playing ball in the street and a random middle aged guy appeared screaming that he knew it was one of us who pulled his tree out of the ground.  He was screaming that he was gonna come to our yards, pull out a tree and shit in the hole.

AskReddit,fcj6ohc,t3_eh8gs2,1577678602.0,"Many schizophrenics can't really use it without getting even more paranoid unfortunately... My meds were managing my sz so good I was able to partake for a while, but the meds stopped working (as they do eventually I guess from the body adapting) and so I was stopped from being able to partake. It's too risky that and honestly any other recreational drug will cause me elevated psychosis. While the meds were managing my symptoms weed was a great antidepressant though and the antipsychotics can cause a lot of depression. It's just too delicate a balance to maintain though. Better safe than sorry. I would never suggest normal people not partake. What a great recreational drug and medicine."
