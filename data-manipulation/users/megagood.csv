And not a particularly clever one."
masseffect,ffogs8k,t1_ffnry3a,1580077476.0,I like the idea of trying to make decisions based on another fictional character. Will give that a shot.
masseffect,ffmji1z,t3_eu2hox,1580055544.0,"I go on a magical mystery journey twice a year, and always conclude with the music from the ad (heart of courage) and suicide mission, then an end once and for all (Ec version) and finally Resolution."
BehavioralEconomics,ffir3u7,t3_etsh1w,1579980611.0,Hindsight bias inbound!
AmItheAsshole,ffiqwyw,t1_ffi9wv9,1579980479.0,I agree with your points but shudder at the lol. These are real people in serious shit with kids in the mix.
masseffect,ffiqpsd,t1_ffipuwo,1579980339.0,I don’t really understand what you mean. Until I can move?
facepalm,ffip6kd,t1_ffigopw,1579979264.0,"Yes. The joke is that the character either never knew their father or saw their father brutally murdered.

Maybe not a total facepalm but certainly entertainingly ironic."
masseffect,ffin72s,t1_ffin10k,1579977904.0,I have tried to get into inquisition several times and failed. Always thinking about giving it another go. What’s the secret to getting hooked?
masseffect,ffimxez,t3_etsien,1579977722.0,Yeah.  I could listen to her read the phone book.
masseffect,ffialv3,t3_ets736,1579969302.0,Very Blair Witchy.
todayilearned,ffd8mtz,t1_ffbmfzx,1579815564.0,There is a podcast called The Uncertain Hour that goes in depth on the legal fight over defining peanut butter. You have companies fighting over things but also consumers having the right to know what something is.
AmItheAsshole,ffd5w9y,t3_essrci,1579814033.0,YTA.
masseffect,ffa2jft,t3_eshqyk,1579726598.0,Play 1 on easy whenever you get stuck because the controls are crap. But the world building is essential for the glory that is ME2.
masseffect,ffa2cx5,t1_ff70upk,1579726494.0,"Actually, I would say just as much is from the prologue. Lots of damage to lots of Normandies!"
masseffect,ffa1w10,t1_ff9z717,1579726220.0,No soul is a great description. It was just flat.
replyallpodcast,ffa0ire,t3_ese0m9,1579725421.0,I don’t remember that part of it but I do remember the part where they talk about the transfer of the social accounts to Troy Becker. I laughed as long as they did. Maybe longer.
AmItheAsshole,ff7uhcd,t1_ff7mbnb,1579658657.0,"The table was right next to ours. Most likely they didn’t stop what they were doing, most likely they had a lengthy pause in conversation and heard an attention grabbing word and that set rounds in motion. There is no way for me to prove it was normal volume but I don’t think volume was her issue."
AmItheAsshole,ff6x4vq,t1_ff6wci2,1579636700.0,"I was trying to be clear that we weren't getting anywhere near that level of detail. And we weren't outdoing each other - the tone was people discussing the weather, not getting amped up. So both our content and tone were different from what I think you are imagining. But I hear your point of view."
AmItheAsshole,ff6gs2c,t3_erskit,1579626865.0,NTA. He clearly just didn’t want the fence and is jumping around on reasoning.
AmItheAsshole,ff0hq21,t3_eqxekx,1579468959.0,NTA. If the kid had poured coffee on your laptop there would be no question.
masseffect,feyqufk,t1_feud94o,1579449404.0,The Geth we deserved.
masseffect,feyqsao,t1_fevct14,1579449366.0,Woweeeee.
