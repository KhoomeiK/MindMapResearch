AskReddit,ffimn6t,t1_ffhylpb,1579977522.0,"Mr Robot has a pretty awesome episode making copious use of this to comedic effect. I think it’s in the second season when Elliot gets his ass beat and Mr Robot distracts him by turning his life into a 70s sitcom. Mr Robot is driving in the manor you describe and is not even pretending to pay attention. At various points he runs over Tyrell and gets pulled over by a cop Gideon for his shitty driving. 

One of my favorite episodes."

UPDATE: I might need to do more testing because it seems to be worse on .18. Went from around 45 UPS consistently to hovering around 38-40. 

Might be too many variables going on. For one thing not all the mods I was using (nothing crazy but some of them almost certainly impact performance on some level) had been updated last night when I tried it so it’s hard to do a true apples to apples comparison.

IAmA,fetb5ay,t1_feq6tef,1579373539.0,"In this particular case I would wager it has more to do with risk management that fucking workers. Amazon is fully capable of fucking their own workers without a middle man. 

Providing any kind of transportation caries an enormous level of risk and the Amazon bean counters no doubt calculated that the cost of paying a contractor barely enough to cover their costs and deferring all the risk to them would save them billions in the long run. Particularly on insurance. If one of the contractors has a huge fuck up and can’t get insured, they go under and are easily replaced with the next chump in like who thinks that shit is easy. 

But, you know, assuming everything falls into the same category is good too."

From the perspective of the whole social system, it is a trend, but individuals make decisions based on their emotions and belief systems. And what is your point anyway? Would it not better to prevent the rejects from becoming the sort of person that feels the need to mail bombs to kill indiscriminately? 

What the unibomber did was nobody’s fault but his own, but I also think he could have turned out very differently under different circumstances, and that would have been better for everyone."
todayilearned,fen2qsa,t1_fen0vid,1579275673.0,"Woah there turbo, I didn’t defend or victimize him, or assign any blame for the things done to him. There’s nothing wrong with a bit of empathy, even if the fucked up things that happen to a person are, in large part, their own fault. Furthermore, just because something is a person’s own fault, doesn’t mean they deserve the fucked up things that happen to them. 

I believe that understanding why a person believes what they believe offers important insight into humanity at large, and you cannot really do that if you’re pointing fingers and slinging insults. Doesn’t mean there isn’t enough blame to go around."

One of the reasons I think ribbon maze works is there is the resource patches are at the dead ends of the maze. Sound simple but it creates this space vs resources vs transportation dichotomy that you are always faced with. Feels a little like 3D Tetris trying to plan things out so you don’t block yourself in or prevent expansion."

factorio,fegublz,t3_ep1uf1,1579102706.0,"Sounds like you would benefit from imposing some kind of structure over your factory. A bus is the most common and accessible way to do this, but there are other ways. There’s a bazillion guides out there on how to do a main bus just google ‘factorio main bus’ and get an idea for what that means. 

I find that the best way to go in this game when you do not know what you’re doing is just to try something and “make it work” no matter how ugly it turns out. Invariably you will learn something (probably a lot more than 1 thing) in the process and you can use that knowledge to improve your design next time.  

If you feel stuck it’s probably because you can’t figure out how to accomplish a task under the self-imposed rules you have set (it must look nice, it must be efficient, etc...). Rules can help order your thinking but they can also stop you from learning new things, so when you find yourself stuck just throw caution to the wind and do whatever it takes to make it work. Make it pretty/efficient/ratio-ed later."

factorio,fe1qqpr,t3_enmb9u,1578829754.0,"I'm assuming since you have it on the bus along with GC/RC's you're planing on making steel before the bus?

If that's the case you can lose most of the iron. Hard to say exactly how much you need without knowing your target SPM. 

There's not really any reason to pipe crude oil/light oil/heavy oil. Crude oil you are clearly already processing, only thing you need light for is rocket fuel so you may as well just assemble that in your refinery and then bus it out to the rocket site. Lubricant is all you need from heavy oil so bus that."

Yeah that's not even close to true. If he's making GC's and steel elsewhere then you need almost 4x as much copper as iron plates. If you do red circuits elsewhere as well then its about 2:1 copper:iron."

The characters on Noble team are all great too which makes the story hit a lot harder. 

And you got cool things like Halsey being introduced as her perky self, the birth of Cortana, the intro for Captain Keys and the Pillar of Autumn. Lots of fun nods to the earlier games without feeling cheesy or contrived."
factorio,fcn4965,t1_fcmhr64,1577802840.0,"The “problem” is actually the game’s solution to a different problem which you will give yourself if you “solve” it. If you use circuits to prevent the centrifuge from using its internal buffer (loading an extra 80 235), then there is a fair bit of downtime between cycles, which will decrease production. 

In any case, there is a much simpler solution to Koravex without using circuits. But it’s fun to play with so keep playing!

It is a bit annoying to wait the first time for the buffer to fill up, but ultimately it doesn’t matter. When I set up uranium processing i do it in 4 trips usually... set up the ore mining and basic processing with 20 centrifuges. Then wait till i have 40 235 (and the Koravex tech) and set up my first Koravex centrifuge, usually with a few speed modules in it. Then I just let it be for a half hour or so and come back and kickstart 3-4 more Koravex centrifuges. You can keep growing exponentially from there if you need lots of nukes or something, but generally it’s just running my power so I can let it sit."

Accumulators don’t have much use when you’re using nuclear. And they will end up making your electrical grid interface more confusing if you don’t know what you’re looking at. 

I didn’t count but visually you look pretty close to good ratio for a 4 reactor build which should yield around 480 MW maximum. Should last you a while.

The thing about power generation is that your power grid will only produce enough power to meet the current demand. So that’s the 50 MW you’re looking at. To calculate your maximum power, take the max output stat of your turbines and multiply that by the number you have in service. That might not be perfect because your build might be suboptimal for various reasons, but assuming the heat/steam is being distributed properly in your design then the theoretical maximum should be very close to the actual maximum. 

The math on solar/accumulators is quite a bit more complicated... and that’s a big reason to just leave accumulators alone until you are comfortable with the basics."
factorio,fc6g8qp,t1_fc5f6ya,1577479849.0,"Several things don’t make a lot of sense to me. 

Why not use assembler 3s?

If you want compact, try beacons... you can make a compressed red belt with 2 GC assemblers in an 8 beacon setup. 

You’re using a lot of speed 3s for basically no reason. You can achieve the same result with 3 module 1s, which costs very little. 

You could probably make a beaconed belt of chips using almost the same number of speed 3s as you are using in this setup, and produce the same amount using 40% less inputs to boot."
