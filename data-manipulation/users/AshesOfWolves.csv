depression,fd6atn1,t1_fd6aljl,1578188148.0,"“Okay” is about as good as it ever gets. Good luck and blessings to you, friend."
depression,fd67erx,t3_ek1zkw,1578186620.0,"I’m currently 25 about to be 26 this month and although I’m not much older than you, I’ll share this with you; dropping out of college was my worst mistake. I married someone and let them be my crutch for happiness. Now my marriage is falling apart and I’m alone entirely. If it wasn’t for my daughter I would’ve already killed myself and never even told anyone. I say all of this to say, don’t let your mental anguish right now cause you to set yourself up for mental anguish the rest of your life. I’m in no position to give advice obviously, but this is my perspective and I hope you can make it through. 

We all deserve happiness, but not all of us get what we deserve. Good luck, friend."
bodymods,fd66gj4,t1_fd64m4v,1578186199.0,Lmao I see how you would get that at first.
depression,fd5y25e,t3_ek3uky,1578182943.0,I have severe depression and anxiety and get told “don’t bring that depressed ass shit around me or I’m going to leave you” by my wife that I’m (idiotically) in love with. Trust me I know your pain.
depression,fd5xnf9,t3_ek1ll9,1578182798.0,"I’ve been married for 6 years and my spouse makes me feel this way. I feel like the only love I’ll ever feel again is from my children. Everyone else only cares about themselves. For example, I’m staying home tonight with my kids and my wife is going out for a “girls night”. Fuck it. Eventually after trying so much you cant do anything except go numb."
marriageadvice,fcxk06t,t3_ejgjld,1578064813.0,"I’m 25m and I’ve been married 6 years and dealt with these same issues plus some. The key is, if you love each other don’t give up and don’t let anyone come between you all. Granted, my wife and I are having some bad issues right now but I still haven’t and won’t give up. The only thing I won’t tolerate is lying or cheating. Basically everything else we work through. I know this isn’t too good of advice but I at least understand what you’re going through. Good luck my friend."
marriageadvice,fcxbrkm,t1_fcwyll6,1578058538.0,Thank you. That’s how I feel as well. Especially considering I have diagnosed depression and anxiety. I understand that I overthink and overreact sometimes but a spouse should help when they know you have mental health problems like I do.
marriageadvice,fcxbkek,t3_eja8oe,1578058359.0,"Honestly, going through the phone actually would cause me to be able to trust her. It’s just been a big change in our marriage this year. First it was “you’re suffocating me I need space” so I gave her space, let her do her own thing for a while and live. But when we started getting close again, I noticed little things. My name was changed from “hubby” with a heart, to my government name. Okay, weird but no biggie. Then I asked to see her Snapchat. (We’ve both agreed our entire relationship that Snapchat was for single people basically) her reply was no, that we’ve been married 6 years and didn’t need to invade each other’s privacy. Which I get but we’d always had an “open phone policy” essentially. So anytime one of us wanted, she could grab my phone and look at whatever she wanted and vice versa. 
Perhaps she doesn’t have anything she’s hiding but she makes herself look suspicious, especially since I have anxiety and figured she’d wanna help me through that."
marriageadvice,fcvqkk8,t3_ej64yn,1578007860.0,"Have either of you tried therapy? Maybe both of you are trying to put too much on each other and you need an outsider to talk to and ease your burdens. I myself just reached out for help. (with depression and anxiety, not self harm) but I used to have a self harm problem. I didn’t want anyone to know and I felt ashamed that I felt the need to do it to feel something. Although I don’t know your pain of losing your mother recently, I do know that the self harm will only lead to eventual rock bottom. If she were to find out on accident about it, she will be devastated and more damage will be done. I think you should seek possible therapy or medication and see if that helps. You don’t want your self harm to become a secret that will eventually be another burden for you to carry. 
Much love and support to you my friend. I wish you the best."

depression,fcpci0y,t1_fcp79d6,1577858243.0,"Well mission accomplished; I didn’t ruin the night. I still feel like shit about myself and lonely because her attention isn’t on me like it used to be. I still adore her and look at her with hunger in my eyes, meanwhile she seems almost uninterested. But as I said, I overthink everything. I just hate being this way because my mind tries to ruin every ounce of happiness I get."

relationship_advice,fck7zha,t3_ehiy0j,1577719101.0,"OP, please update us once you tell your parents what happened. This isn’t okay. This is borderline pedophilia and 100% inappropriate and disgusting. My daughter is only 3 but if she were 19 and this happened, I wouldn’t give a damn about a “secret” that she had, I’d give a damn about her safety, and her mental health. 
Do not let this man get away with this, cause eventually he might get aggressive and drastic. Please let us know how this goes."

marriageadvice,fcizlq6,t1_fciwzr7,1577673624.0,"Yeah, I’m actually calling my doctor tomorrow to attempt to get help. I haven’t taken antidepressants since high school but at this point I have to try them. I can’t keep going on like this. It’s a very painful existence and keeps me down regardless of where I am or what I’m doing. It’s like my brain catches me being happy for a split second and says “oh, here, hold all these negative thoughts you forgot about”"
marriageadvice,fcizd6t,t1_fciud88,1577673462.0,"She cares about herself. And our children, I’ll never take that from her, she’s a good mom. And I would’ve thought she was depressed too, but she doesn’t seem to be. She has many friends, and she always seems happy. Also, anytime I feel down or something is bothering me I usually just get quiet or listen to music to try to cope and when I do this she gets angry and tells me my depression is annoying and a “buzz kill” and if I’m not happy to leave. 
But I can’t leave.
I depend on her. 
I love her. And I hate myself for it."
depression,fcihcqo,t3_eh9up7,1577662560.0,"I know the feeling. It’s like being stuck in limbo. I want to die, but I don’t want the same misery to befall my family."
bodymods,fcca8ch,t1_fcc4u9v,1577596101.0,"I wasn’t aware you had walked in my shoes. Please tell me more about myself? 

You’ll never have any clue what it’s like to live a day With the bullshit I live with. 
And wanting a small serotonin rush from people telling me I didn’t fuck up my life just because of the tattoos and piercings I enjoy having, isn’t a call out to get called “hot” I live in a hick ass Back woods town on the Bible Belt. My entire life feels like a replay of high school. Most people here are cruel when it comes to appearance maybe you just aren’t accustomed to. 
Learn to empathize before jumping to conclusions like everyone else. Or at least attempt a conversation then pass judgement."

depression,fc7l9sh,t1_fc7ef6k,1577511094.0,"Thank you for this incredibly accurate description of how I feel. I will try that sub and try to vent there. I keep myself in a cycle of bottling up everything and tolerating all the misery with clenched teeth,  Then after a while I meltdown and release every feeling and try to vent all at once, only to be put down more and belittled until I give up and start the bottling all over again. It’s very unhealthy and it makes me loathe people who don’t seem to feel the way I do. The people who think love and passion isn’t important. The people who just go around breaking hearts, while never being vulnerable enough to be broken themselves. After a while I remember those people aren’t typically good people and I stop being envious, but I still find a small portion of me wishing I could just flick my “emotion” button and shut it all off. Sorry for the rant, just merely getting my thoughts into the world helps me a little."
depression,fc6xhy5,t1_fc6x1uc,1577492031.0,"I know that’s what i need to do but we have kids. And also, as unhealthy as it is I continue to try to make it work. I keep trying to get through to her. I’ve always had a hard time walking away from people, even those who aren’t good for me. So I guess I’m to blame for dealing with it."
depression,fc6wjza,t1_fc6wdo7,1577491335.0,Thank you. I have a wife but I’m not “allowed” to feel depressed around her cause it ruins her mood..
FreeCompliments,fc6v0w0,t1_fc5vj3j,1577490215.0,"Thank you so much. It’s extremely difficult to stay true to myself because I have such a bad habit of caring more about other people than my own well being. I’ve always put others first, that’s my tragic flaw."

I’m working on trying to get her to agree to meeting with a doctor because I feel that’s the real route to get things back on track for us. I’m also working to get myself counseling as well. I had a bad experience with a certain anti-depressant as a teen, so they cause me to be a little weary of taking them or which one my wife should be prescribed. Again, thank you for the words of advice. I’m down to my last options of making this work in a healthy manner."

In all reality, my brain tells me I should most likely walk away and try to move on. However my heart is stronger than my brain and although the mental and emotional damage Iâ€™m suffering through is very painful and hard to cope with, I feel like her having these mental health problems are all the more reason not to walk away from her. She truly is the love of my life and im aware Iâ€™m unhealthily dependent upon her for my happiness but Iâ€™ve tried and tried to stop caring and stop wanting her the way that I do, to no avail. In our first 5 years together she helped build me into the person I am today and she was the perfect wife. Iâ€™ll always hang onto the sliver of hope that she will return to how she was back then. Without that hope I have nothing."

askwomenadvice,fc3vei9,t1_fc3tybq,1577399615.0,"Honestly, your response has been the most â€œmind easingâ€ (for lack of a better expression) and I sincerely thank you for it. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed writing and reading so thatâ€™s probably a good resource to turn to for me. As for sports, it pretty much is a matter of lack of time for that as well. Lack of time for socializing is basically the reason I even started using reddit in the first place. (Hell im at work right now as Iâ€™m typing this) And I usually just spend the entirety of my Sundays spending time with and talking to my kids. Thatâ€™s one thing that, no matter what happens or how depressed I feel, keeps me grounded and level headed. 

Regarding increasing my price as a contractor I canâ€™t at the moment. Itâ€™s a contract for a set amount because itâ€™s always the same job, but Iâ€™m doing my best to get some side work. 

Finally, Iâ€™ve been slowly working up to not being as vulnerable as I have been with her. As well as not doing every little unreasonable thing she asks of me. I donâ€™t enjoy wearing my heart on my sleeve and Iâ€™m doing my best to change that and itâ€™s no easy task. I simply want my old wife back and to have that same adoration for each other that we had for years. Iâ€™m willing to try anything at this point"
askwomenadvice,fc3u9bh,t1_fc3sruu,1577398780.0,"Youâ€™re entirely correct and Iâ€™m painfully aware of that. But itâ€™s nearly impossible to get out of being this way. I know whatâ€™s wrong with me and that I am too dependent upon her. Itâ€™s not something I can just fix or put a stop to immediately. I want to find a way to become independent and not have to rely on others for my happiness, but I want to save my marriage at the same time because I do love her."
askwomenadvice,fc3sggg,t1_fc3oth1,1577397469.0,"Yes I agree entirely. I do need therapy myself. However, certain circumstances in my life prevent me from ever having time to schedule a doctors appointment for myself. Iâ€™m an independent contractor in the field of construction and I work 12-14hrs a day 6 days a week (no joke) and Iâ€™m not financially stable enough to take a day off at the moment. Iâ€™m doing my best to hold everything together with very little help. I know I should find a way to put my well being first and get it taken care of but even if I were to, I wouldnâ€™t be able to meet with a therapist on a regular basis. 

I am honestly starting to think maybe I have some sort of mental health issue myself because I directly correlate her happiness with my own. I never put myself first in anything and I honestly do anything she asks of me just to make her happy. I know itâ€™s an unhealthy thought process, but a part of me feels that I owe her for making me into the man I am today (because of everything weâ€™ve been through in our past. Again, I know itâ€™s an illogical, unhealthy thought pattern.) But I feel like I should hold on, even when it hurts like hell not feeling loved by her. I just wish sheâ€™d just let me go if she isnâ€™t in love with me anymore. 

I apologize if this turned into a rant, Iâ€™m just emotional and have nobody (literally) that I can vent to. I appreciate all offers of thoughts and advice. Iâ€™m just struggling with having to sacrifice my own happiness because she doesnâ€™t seem to think she should change. Obviously Iâ€™m not perfect, Iâ€™m not claiming to be, but the only thing I can see that I do wrong is constantly try to initiate conversations about receiving affection and love."
marriageadvice,fc3n2gg,t1_fc3la6g,1577393637.0,"Thank you. I feel like this is the best option for me. Because I love her more than anything and I would go to any lengths to save our marriage and get back to our happy, loving relationship. Itâ€™s one of the most difficult things Iâ€™ve ever had to do though because it makes me feel extremely alone throughout this. I just donâ€™t know how to cope myself while trying to be the strong core my family needs"
askwomenadvice,fc3mog2,t1_fc3km5x,1577393362.0,"Itâ€™s just so hard to accept. I mean I used to tell everyone â€œgetting married at 19 was the best thing I ever didâ€ simply because it was better than everything Iâ€™d ever imagined. I had the girl of my dreams, we were both madly in love, matched sexually, mentally and spiritually. Honestly, Iâ€™m too weak to ever leave her myself, sadly. Iâ€™ve invested everything in her over the years. I literally have no friends, and very little family so my support group isnâ€™t that strong, and on top of that I am aware that I have abandonment issues from things that happened in the past. 

I wish I didnâ€™t feel so in love with her. I wish I didnâ€™t feel like she was directly associated with my happiness. I want to be able to seem unbothered and indifferent as she does, but I simply canâ€™t. Every time Iâ€™ve ever attempted to leave, I just canâ€™t do it. She wonâ€™t leave me or tell me she thinks we need to be done either. She acts like everything is fine and says I â€œmake up these issues in my head.â€ And that Iâ€™m â€œacting like a teenage boyâ€ or a â€œcrybabyâ€ over sex and affection. Sheâ€™s the love of my life and unfortunately she cant empathize or even sympathize with what I try to convey to her. I know itâ€™s hard to give advice to someone who thinks theyâ€™re too weak to leave, but Iâ€™m really tired of not being able to vent or talk to her about how I feel on the subject. 

I feel as though Iâ€™m going to end up hanging onto her until she finally walks away herself, or I breakdown from it all. I just donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve learned worshipping someone the way I do her is not healthy, but itâ€™s already too late. Life without her is almost unimaginable."

FreeCompliments,fc38oor,t1_fc37n4p,1577384143.0,"Itâ€™s impressive to have that level of empathy considering youâ€™re only a high schooler. Iâ€™ve been known to overreact to harassment once you tolerate it for so long. Also, I was originally a psychology major in college (I didnâ€™t finish, unfortunately) and my goal in life was to become a therapist because I never want anyone to feel the ultra low points in life that Iâ€™ve felt. I would never wish the things Iâ€™ve felt upon anyone on this planet. Once again, thank you for all the support and help!"
FreeCompliments,fc37bpx,t1_fc374a2,1577383203.0,That definitely means a lot to me! Same to you as well! I would love someone to vent to and just have conversation with every once in a while. Feeling alone and bottling things up constantly isnâ€™t healthy but sometimes there isnâ€™t much of a choice.
FreeCompliments,fc36v85,t1_fc36n6w,1577382883.0,Iâ€™m actually new to reddit altogether. Iâ€™ve found it very helpful already. My self esteem has been at the lowest itâ€™s ever been and this sub has helped me a little within such a small amount of time. I feel alone very often and so having strangers share kind words and compliments makes a world of difference for me. (:
FreeCompliments,fc36fbx,t1_fc368o5,1577382583.0,Much love and much appreciated! The positivity has had a huge effect on my morning thus far! I hope you have a very wonderful day! â¤ï¸
depression,fc33utb,t1_fc2o8yf,1577380812.0,"I completely understand that feeling of being judged and afraid of people hurting my feelings when I show vulnerability. I have many tattoos, one on my face, many on my hands and I am constantly judged as a bad person or a drug addict when Iâ€™m neither. I just want friends and to feel normal around people but itâ€™s near impossible. Just remember, you are not diseased no matter what your appearance is. Theyâ€™re the disease for not being humane enough to empathize and respect you as a human being. As long as you can find a way to love yourself and love who you are, forget what anybody else thinks about you. Lifeâ€™s too short to waste on thoughts from miserable people who just put you down. Good luck to you and much love and positivity to you."
depression,fc3393c,t1_fc30kd3,1577380409.0,"I understand and empathize entirely. I (25M) have struggled my entire life with anxiety and depression and the feeling is nearly impossible to describe to someone whoâ€™s never felt it. If I didnâ€™t have my children, there is no telling where I would be, and even with them itâ€™s still hard to cling onto a want to be in this life. I walk this earth feeling completely alone. However, we are not alone. Your pain is shared. I hope you get through the situation youâ€™re currently in. Most of the time things do get better (as cliche as that is) even if only in glimpses of happiness. Good luck my friend."

relationship_advice,fbzapz0,t3_efaew9,1577240454.0,"Do you feel as though Iâ€™m being illogical? I mean I donâ€™t feel as though Iâ€™m asking anything out of the way. I think any husband would enjoy feeling loved and appreciated every once in a while. Especially because I have no support system or close friends. I put all my â€œeggs in one basketâ€ so to speak. My wife is the only person I have that even truly knows me, but lack of love and communication makes me feel even more alone than I already feel daily."
