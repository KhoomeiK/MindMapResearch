worldnews,ff8vleg,t1_ff8hcr7,1579697577.0,There is a dairy out here in the Midwest called Oberweis that charges about two bucks bottle deposit that you get back when you exchange or return it. That's about a 40 % surcharge on the milk. They also now sell it in stores with the same deposit. I see people lined up with crates of bottles to return every month. I truly believe you can incentivize this reuse behavior and decrease waste. Not to 100% but enough to make serious dents in single waste pollution.

NoStupidQuestions,fd9p2f3,t1_fd8fd84,1578236288.0,"A word of advice for acclimating your dogs to the Roomba, a vacuum, or animals on TV. Loudly and standing up l, scold the item in question. For the vacuum, I turn it on, the dogs freak out, and I stare and it and point and loudly tell it NO, and other things that I usually tell me dogs when I scold them, just directed at the object instead. Make sure the dogs are observing you do it. I have pretty good success with this method.
EDIT: Someone PMd me instead of just posting asking a question. The reason this works sometimes, is because the animal is threatened by the object, both personally and as an attack on the pack. You, the presumable alpha, scolding and taking charge of the object, reestablishes the order of dominance in the pack."

It hurts to rotate and tilt my head. I tied doing the stretch where you tilt your head to the front of the shoulder and can feel the stretch. But nothing gives relief. Massaginf the side of the neck inflames it and the following day it is point tender and causes headaches.
