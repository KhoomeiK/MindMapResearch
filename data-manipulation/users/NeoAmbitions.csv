vexillology,ffh7a22,t3_etlupb,1579925106.0,Removed the yellow stars on the Union Jack canton and I just put a star inside a circle on the bottom right just like the star in the center of the Union Jack in Niue's Flag.
vexillology,ffh5jbn,t3_etlj8c,1579923697.0,"The Second Amsterdam Flag redesign today from my previous post the [Ampersand Amsterdam](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillologycirclejerk/comments/etlexg/ampersand_amsterdam/) flag. But in this design the asterisks replaced the St. Andrew Crosses also known as the triple Xs in Amsterdam's Flag.

The asterisks probably don't represent as much as the St. Andrew Cross. It is just a different design. An asterisk is also an alternative for a star."
vexillology,ffh3fm5,t3_etlasr,1579922054.0,The flag of Cascadia with the douglas fir tree on the white triangle with blue on top and gree on the bottom just like the original Cascadia Flag. You can also say it is in the style of the Philippines although the triangle is a bit longer than the Czech Republic.

vexillologycirclejerk,ffd1d4c,t3_eskjqf,1579811488.0,Just one question. Why is there Saudi's Arabic text on an English flag? This is ironic because there are no English texts on this flag.

An alternate Massachusetts with something similar to the Florida Keys which connects to Canada's Nova Scotia. Islands were hard to make and took me some time. I also added a few extra islands for Maine.

The shaded black are states we are not focusing on. In this map, we are focusing on the state of Massachusetts and the province of Nova Scotia as well as the new islands for Maine."

MarioKartTour,ff88nif,t3_es74a4,1579669212.0,Same here but just only in ranked cups. If there is a daily challenge that requires you to hit someone with the Super Horn. You have a higher chance of getting that frenzy. Although it’s not the frenzy I want.
MarioKartTour,ff88bwe,t3_es72nw,1579668925.0,Used to be 6th dropped to 8th. Well lucky them. But the thing is that the participants who get 6th - 10th place gets 400 coins. 400!!. It should be 5 rubies. Or everyone  should get a ruby for participating.  Sorry for my complaint and I know this has been talked about a lot.
MarioKartTour,ff87ypt,t3_es5yrz,1579668604.0,"For me the first item box, a random CPU gets a mega mushroom and automatically gets first place. If you get hit by this... yeah you get the point."
MarioKartTour,ff87sny,t3_es374p,1579668459.0,Worst Rank Cup Yet. Cheep Cheep Lagoon breaks your combo before diving into the water and it’s just a underwhelming track. And Vanilla Lake is just short that has a Pay 2 Win character to get a higher rank.
memes,ff85urz,t3_es58w2,1579666833.0,Well ok. I saw this two times at r/wholesomememes.
vexillology,ff810qp,t3_es5xzf,1579663180.0,"Requested by u/[MiddleSignature1](https://www.reddit.com/user/MiddleSignature1/). This is version two if the fictional nation if the Philippines owned California. Or it is just a flag that represents Filipino Californians. Blue on Top and Red on the bottom representing the color and order of the Philippine Flag. The Sun is on the top left corner that is a symbol for the Philippines. 

Going to take a break redesigning California. See The [Phillipines Version 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/erolrk/flag_of_california_if_it_is_owned_by_the/) here.

vexillology,ff6a4oi,t1_ff65oja,1579622683.0,Thanks for your feedback. I agree that this flag should be a specific region in Palau.

vexillology,ff50721,t3_eromh3,1579576728.0,"If Japan expanded to the Americas and occupied California, this would be its flag. Not as many things have changed except replacing the star with the Japanese Sun.

Edit: Probably going to make a version 2 with this with Japanese Text.

Yes, California probably doesn't get Maple Leaves but its something that Canada would do. I am still looking forward to redesigning this U.S state flag in the future.
