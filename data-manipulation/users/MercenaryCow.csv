Tinder,fgntypy,t1_fgnsgdk,1580952850.0,"It pretty much is though. It just seems like they aren't because straight girls are pretty unsatisfied with sex with most men. So they don't really seek it out. 

Girls can go through literally dozens of guys without reaching orgasm. So it's pretty rare. If they were pretty much guaranteed orgasms just as guys are pretty much guaranteed one, you'd see girls looking for sex all the time. 

Also not orgasming doesn't seem like much of a problem in the lesbian community. Though, they will have sex on and off for 6 hours straight. Ask me how I know. Wait don't, I'll tell you. My lesbian best friend used to live with me. And she had girls over all the time... Girls are worse than us guys."

And they change as you change. I feel like a lot of people don't like others bettering themselves, because it's some petty subconscious thing where they like feeling better than you, and want it to stay that way. If you lose weight, and exercise, not only do you shrink the contrast between yourself and said person, but you might also become better than them. And they can't have either of those things."
