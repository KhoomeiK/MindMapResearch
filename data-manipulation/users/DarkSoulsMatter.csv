neoliberal,ffof15w,t1_ffocj00,1580076999.0,No need to rewrite what Marx already wrote. I’m good. Maybe you will read those words one day. I just figured I would join in on the Sunday shitposting but you’re downvoting everything I say like you really care.
neoliberal,ffobn6i,t1_ffoaaw3,1580075977.0,"Yeah, just omit the contexts of Russia’s history and culture versus American history and culture. That’s fine.

You’re ignoring hegemony and status quo entirely. The world is not just hard science. Your words reak of white reaganite suburbia"
neoliberal,ffo9dmt,t1_ffo8ddf,1580075358.0,"“Only Keynesian economics are valid”

This is why I didn’t go into detail.

Massive amounts of personal resources is not the sole factor in humanity’s technological progress. That is the result of humanity under capitalism. Recognition and reputation becomes seen only under the umbrella of capital, people that do work for the betterment of society will still be rewarded with personal resources.

You come off like religious folk. “Oh poor baby hasn’t even read the Bible... poor thing”"

gay_irl,ffilqo3,t1_ffi3m9h,1579976899.0,Letting a larger body dictate your norms is adherence. No need to consider sexual orientation when isolating gender. They can be discussed separately very easily. Not trying to be inflammatory.

You don’t know that removing corruption is impossible. Especially not with a mindset that says it’s just inevitable, you’re not going to progress.

Repeating something is how a consciousness grows. You cannot improve without trial and error. You are indoctrinated."

AskReddit,fffgy3q,t1_fffg3iu,1579883729.0,"Communism is stateless, moneyless, and classless. That has not been achieved since industrialization. Capitalism did not appear overnight, it took hold in several locations after many “failures” before it solidified. Socialism is the scientific aftermath of capitalism."
AskReddit,fff8gx8,t1_ffevnjg,1579878330.0,"Communism is quite the opposite of anarchy.

Communism doesn’t go against “human nature”, it empowers it.

The incentive to be productive is included in that nature, unrelated to capital or personal gain.

Communism isn’t the death of individualism.

Nice job at showing your indoctrination."

AskReddit,ffe4hvb,t1_ffe3rx8,1579836474.0,Communism has never been achieved. Communism is when a socialist state reaches the point where the government is no longer needed. Socialism is probably more controversial than anything in recent history. Cold War propaganda is a good place to start. There are lots of communists and socialists around the globe today.
