Don’t believe me? Just look at the Sims 4. TS4 has the most DLC of any other Sims entry in history. Most of them are bare bones stuff packs. Expansions have less content now than compared to TS3 or TS2. And let’s not forget about the My First Pet Stuff Pack. An stuff pack that required you already have the $40 Cats and Dogs expansion; an expansion for an expansion.

HistoryMemes,ffuummg,t1_ffum7u2,1580249651.0,"From my understand of our text, *The Houses of History* by Anna Green and Kathleen Troup, the Empiricists believe in eliminating as much bias and subjectivity from historical research. The school of thought started around the time of the Scientific Revolution when the scientific method was created. Historians decided to apply the method to historical research as a way to achieve objective truth. While this a great way of trying be objective, it can result in some rather bland research. Because *just* the facts without any sort of opinion or thought is boring. While this school is great at eliminating subjectivity, there’s only so much you can get rid before you start sounding like Ferris Bueller’s teacher.
