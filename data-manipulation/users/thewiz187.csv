Advice,ff725wa,t3_erwfd4,1579639619.0,"Social media can be poison for your self esteem.  Ex wife was a small time model and you wouldn’t believe how much of this stuff is HIGHLY edited and fake. 

Find something positive to focus on. Self improvement, a hobby, etc. 

I chose the gym life. You won’t feel as inferior to these “beautiful “ people when you look like a Greek god."

If you don’t feel like you have positive qualities, pick one you think you lack and try to improve upon it. Maybe take interest in someone who you think exhibits that quality well.  We can learn a lot from others!"

Advice,fd9os3j,t3_ekagek,1578236162.0,"From someone who just got out of an abusive relationship VERY similar to yours, leave her. 
You CANNOT endure this forever.  

I always will encourage people to work out their problems, but if it’s as bad as it sounds, she needs to seek help by herself and improve herself before she should even consider getting into a relationship with someone else. 

She seems highly manipulative and controlling.  This is an abusive relationship, friend."

Advice,fcb3b5g,t3_egz551,1577581769.0,"Very independent introvert here. 

These people aren’t friends. From what you wrote I believe you are at the same understanding. 

In my dealings with people like this I always was friendly and cordial, but definitely kept my distance. Didn’t meet up outside of school, didn’t sit by them at lunch, avoided unnecessary conversation. Eventually they will get the hint. 

And just for the record, if these people are not supportive of your mental health, you have no obligation to try and make amends with them. Ultimately you have to surround yourself with people who build you up and encourage you, not tear you down.  Don’t be afraid to cut people out of your life even in your post high school life."
