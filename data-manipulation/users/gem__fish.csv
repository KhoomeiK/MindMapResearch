relationship_advice,ffgrr2h,t1_ffgke2k,1579913384.0,Thanks for your input. I think we both just need to work on ourselves and the way we communicate. Relationships are hard. Life is hard.
My600lbLife,ffcln2d,t1_ffcliz6,1579802081.0,"Let's be real, this was actually the lymphedema's episode. Not JT's."
My600lbLife,ffccpdz,t1_ffbfhpv,1579796613.0,So were we! Should have been a 2 part show since he was so big.
My600lbLife,ffcbfil,t1_ffc1hnc,1579795817.0,His lymphedema was HUGE.
My600lbLife,ffcai7d,t1_ffbcirc,1579795231.0,I forgot about this. Yep. This worried me. That poor baby.
My600lbLife,ffcagjb,t3_esnikp,1579795203.0,"Yes. I think way too much into this. Like last night's episode where JT was like, ""I hope Bella is okay."" I immediately went to: What do you mean? Did you leave her alone for days? She's a dog! She needs to go potty!

Or Jeanne's episode in season 7 - which is the most depressing episode of all time in my opinion. Those people were living in POVERTY and they had several dogs. I worried about them and still do to this day."
My600lbLife,ffbsyq1,t3_eslmcj,1579781601.0,"I'm so glad you guys love ""You can turn the room light off."" I wasn't sure anyone else noticed that haha."
My600lbLife,fea6xtd,t1_fe9ph64,1578945063.0,How ya'll* doin'
My600lbLife,fea1lvr,t3_eo62d9,1578943399.0,I'm so jealous!!!!
offmychest,fds1p5n,t3_emo4o3,1578693014.0,What a kick ass friend you are. That's so nice of you.
relationship_advice,fdqw6w0,t3_emtpim,1578675672.0,"I dont know you or your situation, but I can't imagine it will be easy dating while being pregnant. If I were in your situation, I would just focus on myself and preparing for my baby to arrive. I wouldn't be dating."
personalfinance,fdqfkni,t1_fdqfhw2,1578665403.0,Thank you. That's good advice and makes a lot of sense.
relationship_advice,fdlj6mc,t1_fdliflj,1578525193.0,"I mean, just make sure you always have a condom and if they try to say no, you can then explain? That makes the most sense to me."
relationship_advice,fdlhyph,t3_elzwpv,1578524418.0,"As a girl who has contracted HPV, it's not very fun having to go in for routine testing/colposcopies, so any chance you can get to prevent it, please do so. But it is super common & a lot of women don't know who they contracted it from, so don't feel bad - especially if you're vaccinated. My advice is to just use condoms & tell your partners there is the possibility of you having it and you just want to be safe. I'm sure they will understand."
relationship_advice,fdlhaps,t1_fdlf0px,1578524005.0,Did you read the post? You can't really test for it.
BodyPositive,fdf3nt9,t3_el244l,1578352569.0,You have an amazing body!
offmychest,fdcgtpx,t3_ekmj7s,1578274548.0,You are amazing. This isn't easy and you did it! What an inspiration you are to your kids! You should be proud.
BodyPositive,fczeokv,t3_ejoc5g,1578099515.0,Find a hobby that makes you feel good about yourself - particularly something active. I find I feel better when I'm doing something to better myself.
curlyhair,fcsrkhg,t3_eip941,1577923313.0,You are rocking it!
lightsalot,fcntt1w,t3_d8yq57,1577818277.0,So many but I'll go with... Follow You Down
curlyhair,fcntgxv,t3_ei4dc7,1577818092.0,so pretty!!
poledancing,fcnajfq,t3_ehfw8m,1577807425.0,Good luck! I've taken a small intro course but that was a year and a half ago. I just bought a pass for that studio this morning and am hoping to go this weekend as well! :)
relationship_advice,fcn0h1i,t1_fcl14ls,1577799641.0,Savage.
relationship_advice,fcn0c8q,t3_ehn6ac,1577799518.0,"I had a 'friend' who would do nothing but talk shit and bully me. This happened for years. One day, I told my parents ""Don't be surprised if I get suspended tomorrow because I've had enough."" Sure enough, the girl was shit-talking and up to her antics with me again so I approached her and called her out. She said she was ""going to kick my ass,"" so I socked her in the face. That sure as shit stopped her from ever doing it again. I don't condone violence & definitely got suspended, but it was worth it and honestly, my parents were proud of me. They tried to ground me, but it became something we laughed about after a few days. This girl was at least 6 inches taller than me, so it was more the idea of me taking down a big bully that was funny rather than the fight.

I think you are teaching your son a valuable lesson, that standing up for yourself is okay. Hopefully your wife will learn to look at it that way."
vegetarian,fck4i76,t3_ehkutk,1577716347.0,"My boyfriend isn't a vegetarian and I am. We usually cook separate meals, or sometimes the same thing & I'll just eat the veggie version of it (he will keep meat separate). He will eat vegetarian with me though. We make burritos or sometimes I make curry with mixed vegetables and tofu. We just kind of make it work?

Are you willing to enjoy vegetarian food with her? Sometimes it's a nice break to eat the same thing together, as it's a bit less work."
homeowners,fck3rf5,t3_ehm312,1577715715.0,"It doesn't hurt to call and check.. My first gas bill in my house was over $300 (just for the furnace and water heater). I called and the lady who answered the phone knew something was off, as it seemed outrageous. Turns out, the meter was misread and the bill was only supposed to be $42.

Could be the same case for you?"
offmychest,fcg57eo,t3_eh7ctn,1577636581.0,"Being a teenager is so hard. You're in this weird transition period of being a child and also not being a child. It is normal to feel lost and confused.

When I was 17, I had the best friends. Some of them, I still have now (28), some of them I don't and that's okay. We are at different places, in different states and towns, but that's because we are doing what is best for ourselves.

Getting a job isn't necessarily a bad thing. Yes, it's responsibility but it gives you options to get out and meet new people. People who may have the same interests as you, like anime. I know grown ass adults in their 30s who have Pokemon YouTube channels. It's okay to like these things into adulthood.

As much as you think you are going to be alone, I promise you, you are not. I thought that too. Everyone has at one point or another. You will find someone - as well as other friends - who love and accept you for who you are. 

You are still so young and have so much ahead of you. Embrace being a teenager, you're not fully in the real world yet. Take it one step at a time. You'll be okay."
confession,fcfzrsd,t3_eh7a69,1577635193.0,"It's your body and their money. You both get to choose how you use it. If it doesn't bother you, then do it. Save or spend the money/donate it, whatever. Thanks for thinking of the planet."
offmychest,fcft5vd,t3_egz92n,1577633470.0,Congratulations! You are extremely brave. I'm so happy  things are better for you and you are happy.
SaltLakeCity,fc5j7ik,t3_eg4l18,1577459076.0,One of my favorite places - especially for breakfast - is Vertical Diner. Check out JRC Events & Metro Music Hall on facebook for shows.
relationship_advice,fc3hlnm,t3_efwulk,1577389975.0,"Regardless of the outcome, maybe it will be good just to talk? I don't doubt that this will be emotional, but maybe you both really need closure. This is really tough and I hope whatever decision you make brings you peace."
relationship_advice,fby8xuv,t3_ef38bq,1577210970.0,You gotta do what you gotta do. Go be happy. Your parents can't have that hold on you & certainly not if you're not happy. Can you get out of your lease/help him find a roommate? 31 isn't old. We live in this society where it's like everyone needs to be something by a certain age & that's just not true. Go find you a man who appreciates you.
