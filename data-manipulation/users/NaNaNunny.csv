niceguys,fcm2ve2,t3_ehx2rs,1577762805.0,This one is from an old account. I did end up sending his information to the FBI (along with [these other threats](https://imgur.com/a/q9vz3Vt) he made). I got confirmation that they paid him a visit and he mysteriously never bothered me again after that.
insanepeoplefacebook,fclvd4m,t3_ehvtdl,1577757379.0,"10 and 12 years old!?

Lady, I got some uncomfortable news for you..."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcl7g0d,t1_fckm99e,1577741446.0,Tennessee. Dufus sent me a link to his Tinder profile showing his location.
niceguys,fcl24ph,t3_ehqrl8,1577738156.0,"That's how I got my first stalker, smiling at some rando on the street. Some people really do take it as a invitation, don't they? :/"

insanepeoplefacebook,fcj6nwr,t1_fcj6782,1577678591.0,"Nope. The FBI did end up paying him a visit, probably more for [these](https://imgur.com/a/q9vz3Vt) threats than anything else."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcj4rvt,t1_fcj3y7a,1577677263.0,Because he kept making new accounts and the admins literally told me there was nothing they could do about it.
insanepeoplefacebook,fcj4p18,t1_fcj3ia3,1577677210.0,"Oh yes, and received confirmation that they followed up with my report.

creepyPMs,fci4wq1,t1_fci4gae,1577657819.0,"Apparently I've got the build up some karma before I can post in that sub. Ahh, the pitfalls of nuking my old accounts every year."

niceguys,fchozcr,t3_eh9sxw,1577652616.0,"This entry was made 15 years ago. Wonder where this guy is now, if he ever crawled out of his hole of self-inflicted misery or if he's still blaming Wench for not returning his feelings."
creepyPMs,fcg3h17,t3_eh7kye,1577636169.0,"I've gotten my share of creepy messages, but this one from an old account is still the Granddaddy of Creeps. I got confirmation that the FBI *did*, in fact, pay him a visit, based on this and [these](https://imgur.com/a/q9vz3Vt) that I forwarded to them. (Names blocked even though he's looong since been banned.)"
creepyPMs,fccqqs5,t1_fccqg2a,1577601521.0,"""Seen."" One of the harshest words in the English language."
creepyPMs,fcbny4w,t3_egwes2,1577589026.0,"The frustration is palpable. I can just imagine him checking and rechecking his messages, wondering if *this* is the time he's said something outrageous enough to warrant a reaction. And constantly being denied the attention he so desperately craves."
badwomensanatomy,fc9qjbg,t3_egs6at,1577556686.0,Is this the manga where the gender roles are flipped? I need to check this out. Taking the piss out of evo psych right here.

I called this guy's Asian-fetishizing comments racist and he went through my entire post history, going back almost a year, to post that comment.

Sorry, I realize I didn't put the context in, and I admire you for giving him the benefit of the doubt."

asexuality,fc764jc,t1_fc74qp2,1577498562.0,"I'm not ace because I've had bad sexual experiences. I've had bad sexual experiences because I'm ace and forced myself to be in sexual situations I wasn't comfortable with to make my partner happy.

Not no more though. Learning that asexuality is a thing and that I didn't ""have"" to be in a relationship and have sex has been *the* most freeing thing for me. Ever."
asexuality,fc6v57s,t3_egdswp,1577490304.0,">I'm seeing a therapist about other problems but she apparently doesn't approve of LGBT issues.

What the fuck? Therapists aren't supposed to approve or disapprove of anything in an official capacity. Can you report her to a medical board?"
SubredditDrama,fc6qafi,t3_egg72s,1577486768.0,I stopped watching anime because I hated having to actively hunt for something without constant tiddies and pantie shots. Non-porn porn is the worst. Just go watch porn.

insanepeoplefacebook,fc65oyj,t1_fc5cw5e,1577472859.0,"I live in a small town too. I once got stalked by a guy just for smiling at him on the street. I would wake up in the morning and find notes pinned to my door. One of the most dread-inducing things I've ever experienced. 

Luckily, because it *is* a small town, when I went to the cops, they were like, ""Oh, yeah, we know that guy."" They went straight to his house and ""had a talk""  that must have put the fear of God into him because I never saw him again. No paperwork needed, which is good because it is *hella* expensive to file a restraining order and I def could not have afforded it at the time."
insanepeoplefacebook,fc4bnai,t1_fc4724h,1577412002.0,"I'd post the whole article, but that would be two minutes of your life you'd never get back. Her solution ends up being: Just have more confidence and you won't get sexually harassed."

insanepeoplefacebook,fc0agbg,t1_fc09rma,1577284942.0,"The thing is, it's not on the victim to have to explain this stuff, *especially* through unsolicited comments on a page set up to support other victims. People *were* trying to explain, some of them with undue politeness IMO, but this lady just could not and *would not* wrap her head around how a person could be raped by someone physically smaller and weaker than them.

She has a history of doing this, and has actually done this to me, personally, on reddit. I'll see if I can dig up her post about how women who ""act"" traumatized by rape are being ""dramatic."""

1. Wow, that's really interesting. Good for you. You go, girl.

2. Woah, why are you being so hostile? I'm agreeing with you.

3. Did...did you really just tell me you hoped someone would cut my clit off?

4. Oh god, your post history! You don't...you don't actually *believe* that, do you?

5. Oh, you do. 

6. I think you might be a robot."
