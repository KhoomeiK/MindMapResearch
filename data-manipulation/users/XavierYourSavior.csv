unpopularopinion,fgnvt18,t3_ezg35e,1580953984.0,Autocorrect sometimes does that and people don't bother editing it because you can easily get the same message out of what they typed.
unpopularopinion,fgmx0u6,t1_fglj0u6,1580933644.0,He tried to force it on her when she refused. If you think that's ok then that's sad.
unpopularopinion,fgmwxwu,t1_fglqzl6,1580933602.0,It's the fact he tries to force it anyway. It's no consensual and shouldn't be forced.

Unexpected,fggwd5b,t1_fgg9s9y,1580771035.0,"What was funny was how he twisted over it? Sure, it's not a good thing, but that doesn't mean it isn't funny as it's subjective. ""Jokes are like food, not everyone gets it"". You can argue the joke isn't funny as it's a real problem, however, that doesn't mean it's not funny. No one is laughing because he's inappropriately hitting it, they're laughing because of the humor aspect of it no one said this was a good thing and you seem to be overreacting."
PublicFreakout,fgggmqy,t1_fg7k11f,1580761465.0,"Ok if you're in a car and the light is green do you still go without being observant of your surroundings? Yes, you have right of way. That doesn't mean you blindly go. You look around first. A lot of people in the graves had right of way, and they're dead because they didn't take the extra time to look before they mindlessly drove."
gtaonline,fgggfze,t1_fgab3ig,1580761354.0,"It's being a bad sport leaving just because you have to take an additional 5 mins to drive. It'll probably take more time just to find another heist set up. It's stupid. It does pay off for me. I have my facility, house, arcade, and bunker at that spot. Easy to go between them. I have no problem plus I'm away from oppressors that are always in the city."
battlefield_4,fggbvr8,t3_exvgsq,1580758587.0,How was he supposed to know you were repairing? He can't see you and most likely spawn in as soon as he saw the option as to see you he would have to hover over it for a couple of seconds. This is just toxic. Don't land at spawn if you're going to repair and you honestly didn't even need to repair.
HumansBeingBros,fgfdtq0,t1_fgehgr4,1580735714.0,"No personal information is leaked. People like to show others good deeds what's so bad about it? It's not hurting anyone. And he does care about being discreet because you and no one else here knows who he is. For all we know it could be made up. I don't see why people are so negative against post that promote kindness. Look at it and move on, you guys have literally anything to complain about and choose the stupidest thing. ""How dare he show the world a good thing!"" Smh"
facepalm,fgbf9c6,t3_exjowg,1580661463.0,"This subreddit really can't take a joke. It's slowly becoming r/whooosh, and that's where the top post are misunderstood jokes. Pathetic."
trashy,fg8hvf0,t1_fg84dys,1580619969.0,"You and the people who upvoted your comment is taking things too seriously. He obviously means anyone, not just adults would be a trashy. He was just being specific in that sentence."

PublicFreakout,fg74b1t,t1_fg6tmdi,1580583668.0,"Not her fault, but it is her fault for not looking both ways. I don't understand how you can walk in a street without looking."
videos,fg71db2,t3_ewxolt,1580581703.0,Can someone tell me what law or rule was violated? What would be the formal law that would be reasoned for her to be in jail?
unpopularopinion,fg714bt,t1_ffr3tsh,1580581542.0,"If the reasons are stupid, then yes you're a sheep. ""I like this car because it has the highest safety ratings in the world"" if that's false, then yes you're a sheep."

HumansBeingBros,fg70w97,t1_ffy0vg0,1580581395.0,"Because you guys are saying it's discrimination when it's just a fact. Do you want me to post some statistics of fatherless black Americans compared to white Americans? Based on the number of blacks there are in America, compared to the number of children that are left fatherless, percentages are high."
antivax,fg70k4i,t1_ffzuq3x,1580581172.0,"The fact that they push so many people to do so. It's the same as saying ""I'm a free traveler"" and therefore a police officer shouldn't be giving you a ticket. It's stupid. I'm not going to stop with facts just because they want to believe in something that doesn't make sense."
