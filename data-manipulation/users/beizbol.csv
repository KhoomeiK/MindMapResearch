careerguidance,ffgayeu,t3_etbmei,1579902252.0,"I see 2 options both are probably risky so try at your own risk. 

Option A: next time you have a task that is clearly not yours to do, send your boss an email letting him know you are done but also bcc his boss. Something like ""here is this weeks *bosses responsibility task*. The more blatantly the task isn't yours the better. Maybe nothing happens. Maybe you end up fired. But also maybe that plants the seed that your boss is ditching his responsibilities. Also the more face time with bosses boss you can get the better. Especially if you can drop hints that you are doing bosses job.

Option B would be a full power move. Compile as much evidence as possible of all of your bosses work that you do and go right over his head. Straight up ask his boss for a promotion to his position or a significant raise. Definitely have an offer somewhere else ready to negotiate with. And the fact that you wouldn't be the first to leave because of boss is good ammo too.

No matter what you end up doing having another offer ready seems universal."

ITCareerQuestions,ffcwy04,t3_esua1o,1579808990.0,"I think you mean ""extensive googling skills like that of a dev"". Obviously there are very talented devs out there. That said, if you are just looking to work in enterprise/government especially at entry level positions (jr dev) you need to know like introductory object oriented programming concepts and how to read/use documentation/stackoverflow. So I won't speak for the rest of IT but I'd say to get started the bar isn't as high as people seem to think or make it out to be."

Only you can know if this applies but it seems like you are sensitive to people being fake/disingenuous. Whether that's who you are naturally or as a result of something I can't say. But as I see it there's 3 ways to do something about it: 
1. Avoid the fakeness ie. less social media
2. Deal with the response ie. mindfulness techniques
3. Find the source ie. introspection/therapy"
unpopularopinion,ff6sl6u,t1_ff69ezj,1579634015.0,"Agreed. I think most of the confusion stems from one of the main ways equality is discussed and evaluated: representation. Not enough group A in role X. Too many group B in role Y. In other words, unequal outcomes. Rarely, if ever, is opportunity discussed or even considered. Which leads people to believe equality is about equallity of outcome. Thoughts?"

Then I watched a few vids of people soldering some stuff like game console/controller mods. Then I tried myself and I wasn't great at first but after a bit of practice I was able to solder. I'm no pro by any stretch. But my modded gamecube controller, and the headphone 3.5mm connector I replaced, both work so good enough.

Mentally: Time box it. Just start with 15 mins. Like literally set a timer on your phone. If you don't want to stop when the timer goes that's up to you but make yourself do a bit no matter what. Worst case you have read a few pages of a book for example and after a week you've read a chapter. There's always the chance you accidentally get in the zone and read half the book too but there's no pressure. If you can do 1% per day, you're done in 3-4 months. 500 page book --> 5 pages a day. 

Quick trick: Feeling dead? Like don't even feel like sitting dead? But it's time for your 15 mins...? Do some quick squats or something to get enough blood going to keep your brain running. Maybe get a groovy song going in your head or better yet play it. Then start quick before your heart slows back down and your energy drops."

seduction,fdkke0u,t3_eluadv,1578505438.0,"On the girls front try wearing clothes that are a bit thicker or wearing more layers. I always found that helped when I felt self conscious about my body. A tip to help with the anxiety of approaching those you find attractive is starting from a mindset of having an interesting/meaningful conversation/interaction and letting the chips fall where they may. You can't force someone to like you. There's a quote along the lines of ""he who suffers before it's necessary suffers more that necessary"". This is to say that worrying about your appearance (on the chance that they don't like it) every time is more painful in the long run than finding that out for a fact that they don't sometimes. I know. Easier said than done."
