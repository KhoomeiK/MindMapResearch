rollerderby,ff4rs4i,t1_ff3pqy1,1579570886.0,Agreed! I didn't get my laps until I switched to radar halos. The caymans were so slippery I was always riding a fine line between keeping my speed fast enough or totally losing grip on the turns.
todayilearned,ff07pvv,t1_fexnciy,1579466105.0,"Yep I mainly only grow purple potatoes in my garden, so I've been the purple mashed potato bringer to Christmas the last couple of years in a row. Some people are weirded out, but they really do make a lovely mashed potato."

todayilearned,fecd911,t1_fec61cj,1578971189.0,And the deer flies. Don't forget those little fuckers.
DIY,fec3kqu,t1_feb01bc,1578966144.0,"I thought baseboard trim only gets put up when you're getting ready to sell the house?
          
At least that's the way it seems to work around here..."
ThunderBay,fdzwscf,t1_fdzvamc,1578797686.0,Fair enough. I was trying to find a way to say I don't care for debating as much as you do. Poor choice of words. Still don't care.
ThunderBay,fdzqtoz,t1_fdzm5f1,1578793684.0,Semantics. Have a lovely evening.
homestead,fdz2xw9,t1_fdxxfil,1578786133.0,"Same. Only ever caught the compost on fire once, whoops. Turns out ashes need more than a couple of days to cool in milder fall weather, that's a lesson you don't repeat. (But it did condense the compost pile considerably, so there was a bright side)"
homestead,fdz28vu,t1_fdxawb3,1578785909.0,"Also in Canada (northern Ontario), I'd say my woodstove runs about 6 months of the year almost non stop. However, I pay a guy to clean it once a year.     
     
Why? Well, it's not a straight shot chimney (2 odd elbows on 2 different stories, the previous owners installed it), I don't particularly like going on the roof with no one else around, and I know the chimney sweep, he's a good guy, he lets me know if anything looks unusual and he cuts me a deal.     
In my case, it really doesn't need to be cleaned more than once a year."
