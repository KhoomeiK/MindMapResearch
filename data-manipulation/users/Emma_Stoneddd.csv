bipolar_irl,ffiuapk,t1_ffi6f6l,1579982898.0,"Most definitely, I was so fortunate to find someone in the treatment and recovery community that really understands. he didn't know for sure I was bipolar until a psych put me on SSRI's and instead of him being freaked out  he face palmed and was like everything makes sense now . High five for awesome supportive husbears !"

AmItheAsshole,ff4nebn,t3_erbo16,1579567836.0,"NTA but as someone who used things like that as a teen, and then escalated to heroin as an adult, the focus should NOT be on that he is using, but the why. Something is causing him to seek chemical comfort and traditional treatment is often times bullshit. I went to a treatment center at 16 for 6 months and not only did it just teach me to lie and hide things better, it closed down a year later. I would urge your parents to send him somewhere else and to carefully do their research and try to find every review they can, with the focus being on mental health. I think banning him for a long time could worsen the issue though. How about making a deal with him if he agrees to treatment/drug tests (but it sounds like hes using things that won't show up on a test) then hes welcome back?"
