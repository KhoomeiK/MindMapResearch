Drugs,fffutsx,t3_et9p0g,1579892277.0,"My mum knew as one day I came home at 4am pinging off my nut and so did my mum literally secounds after I get in the house. She was also on something, I never asked but I assume it was amphetamine. We caught each other out at the same time, we both knew we where both on drugs but never spoke about it. We just had a cup of tea and a nice chat at the kitchen table for a few hours. 

With weed its easier for parents to find out as its more of a casual drug but party drugs are harder to realise as youre more likely to come home as the drugs are wearing off."

Mirtazapine_Remeron,fekdejg,t3_epmakw,1579197707.0,"In the recent past I was using benzos and opiates for recreational purposes/ self medicating. Due to this I dont find the sedation to be that strong except in the morning where its almost impossible to get out of bed and I end up sleeping in till the evening. 

A cup of coffee in the morning helps wake me up. I try and enjoy the sedation as my head isnt racing and I feel mostly calm for once. Try not to take it during the day and only at night."
Mirtazapine_Remeron,fejswve,t1_fejnp9f,1579185054.0,Should I take the other 7.5mg in the morning or just before I fall asleep ?
zoloft,feipjf2,t3_ep9l72,1579144022.0,If shes only just started taking Zolft then yes it can be. When I started I was nausous to the point of throwing up and felt dizzy from time to time. Id advice speaking to a doctor if the symptoms get worse.

depression,fdqs0hm,t3_emnl5m,1578673632.0,"I understand your point but I wouldnt choice cancer, maybe another physical illness. After seeing my mum go through cancer, Id rather have mental illness, all the pain meds she was on and all the pain she went through made her wish for death. In the end she couldnt take anymore and was given a leathal dose of morphine. Even with cancer she struggled to get disability benifits despite not being able to do things for herself. She was a strong woman but cancer took that away from her. The endless doctors appiontments and A and E trips she took, Id sit with her 12hrs at a time whilst she got treatment. Cancers more than just chemo and a few treatments, its painful and most likely gives you depression. When I saw her die, I was relieved that it was all over and she could finaly have a good rest. Id choose mental illness over Cancer. Fuck cancer."

If youv only just started taking them, give it a few weeks as your sleep may improve.
My sleep got so bad I had to switch to Mirtazapine which has a seditive effect."
