gaming,fexc4yq,t1_fex8kok,1579428436.0,"Pretty much yeah. It's bigger and heavier than a regular Xbox controller but I've never had to really stretch for anything on it, it's like changing over from a PS controller to an Xbox one you just get used to it. The real issue is the TouchPad itself. The left one is fine and works exactly like dpad can press it like you would a normal button or set it to respond to touch. The right pad though is completely smooth so there is no indexing it, you don't know when you're centered which is really awkward for FPS games. You can set it to work like a mouse which is basically just a tracpad on a laptop, an analog stick where it will move the camera in the direction like it normally would as long as you keep contact with the pad, or a cross between both called ""mouse like joystick"" which is the default option and works fairly well but sensitivity needs to be dialed in for each game, and you cant do quick 180 movements with it unless you change ""trackball friction"" which basically let's you flick the camera in a direction and the friction is basically how quickly it stops after you take your finger off the pad. 

The L1/LB  R1/RB buttons are super stiff even after 3 years of it being my only controller so I usually rebind them to the paddles on the back of the controller

The entire controller is rebindable, and there's user made configurations you can import for every game I've played with it so far. Because of this you can use it with games that don't have controller support. I love it for playing sunless sea for example.

It's really gimmicky and I can definitely see why people didn't like it. But I'm actually overall pretty satisfied with it though, the sheer amount of setting customization has allowed me to adapt it to my liking and to overcome the worst of its shortcomings. The base idea was actually pretty solid and if they took community feedback into consideration they could probably get a decent 2nd generation out of it."
