nhl,ffpcnb0,t1_ffpaaoz,1580091717.0,"The NBC commentary was good for the first month it was introduced ... every year after that it got more and more boring, always turned the commentary off, this is a nice change"
nhl,ffp9rf6,t1_ffp7cul,1580089701.0,The day they bring them back is the day I never buy EA again .. Bill Clement on the other hand was the GOAT from NHL99.. honestly the commentary in 20 with Cybulkski is most reminiscent of the NHL99 and NHL rock the rink commentary
AskReddit,ffj8vtl,t1_ffj8i1d,1579993213.0,"No not at all. OP even replied to me saying thank you for asking in such a respectful way and offered an explanation to her past ... you can continue to believe that I was belittling OP since you like to twist words to fit your story like I already stated. Do me a favour and fuck off, you don’t know me. OP, or any of the background relating to this post or OPs life."
AskReddit,ffj80k0,t1_ffj20mo,1579992671.0,"Buddy what are you even saying? I only asked op why they didn’t fight back because I was unaware of how old they were during all this. I don’t expect a child to take down a full grown adult .. I’ve had to fight for family before, you don’t know peoples history like I don’t know OPs history 
 
Not once did I imply op was a “pussy”... you can twist words to make it fit your narrative or I can make you eat yours .. it’s your choice"

AskReddit,ffhy3ez,t1_ffhuhez,1579958877.0,I’d say that stating your marriage is “good for the most part” is also an underlying issue in all this
funny,ffg8953,t3_etfifa,1579900593.0,George Carlin was just a grumpy old man who shit on anything and everything ... his comedy act was him complaining about everything
