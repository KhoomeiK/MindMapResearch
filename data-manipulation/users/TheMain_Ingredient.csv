news,ff4ra0z,t1_ff48k3p,1579570539.0,">The distinction I made was between asking for the sake of something good vs. asking for the sake of proving God exists.

In the Biblical context, the devil, *who already knew who Jesus was and his power absolutely*, was trying to provoke him into demonstrating them needlessly. The case I provided is somebody who *doesn't know who Jesus really is and if He is God,* and I argued that it would necessarily be a good thing to have some sort of good evidence and so asking wouldn't qualify as ""putting God to the test,"" given the differences in context. You said that would undermine faith, which is why I'm asking about the nature of faith and whether having evidence actually does undermine it (I don't think it does). You don't have to answer me, but I'm not convinced yet that I'm wrong about my example being a valid case of ""asking for the sake of something good.""

>I also provided a pretty clear definition of faith: willingness to believe. The benefits or value or justifiability of faith is a tangent.

Faith is ""willingness to believe""? Really? If a person is an Muslim and is WILLING to believe Jesus is God but doesn't because they don't think it's as reasonable as what they currently believe, you would say they **have faith** in Jesus's divinity? Practically every human being is WILLING to believe in basically anything if given a good reason. If you think faith is belief WITHOUT a good reason, then how would you know what to put faith in?

Personally, I think faith is a combination of wanting/hoping for something, trusting something, and believing in something. So, I WANT God to exist. I TRUST God will do what He says He will. And I BELIEVE in God and His Word. That would be faith, and it would STILL be faith regardless of whether God has revealed Himself to me or not.

If certainty or near-certainty invalidated faith, does that mean Moses didn't have faith? Paul didn't have faith? The disciples that saw Jesus ascend and resurrect didn't have faith? If not, why shouldn't others be allowed to have that level of evidence?"
news,ff47hv3,t1_ff43j70,1579557225.0,"That's fine. I think that whether or not there is a flaw depends on how ""good faith"" is defined, because I think the example I give of people praying for signs qualifies as ""good faith."" I also have yet to hear a good description of what faith is, how one should come to have faith in some things but not others, and what makes faith an admirable and important trait."

news,ff3y6k2,t1_ff3uo2z,1579551428.0,"I agree, motives do matter!

Let's imagine you have a Muslim, a Jew, an Atheist, or person of whatever other non-Christian religion/philosophy you want. They want to know if Jesus is really the son of God/God Himself. So, they pray, sincerely, to Jesus that, if He truly is God, to reveal Himself to them so that they will believe. The obvious ""good"" of this scenario being, they now believe in the truth and can help convince others of it.

...Does that count? Or is that ""putting god to the test?""

Another issue:

People pray in full belief with the intent to bring about good all the time. ""Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven."" Have no two Christians ever prayed to end world hunger? Or child cancer? Or stop all natural disasters?

If I am a non-Christian, but I value truth and the search for truth, how am I supposed to get from my non-Christian state to a Christian state with intellectual honesty if I can't pray to God for a sign and would only ever MAYBE get a sign after I've already decided to full-on believe? It's a total catch-22 that promotes a completely warped way of going about searching for truth (believe first, then look for reasons to re-enforce your belief). That system is literally *begging* to confuse and dissuade people."

news,ff3opls,t1_ff3l15o,1579545579.0,"I mean, I have only ever heard this story given in a religious context, mostly given for the moral messages I’ve mentioned above. If you hear it going around within your group as a secular story, then power to you. I would automatically assume you’re a Christian if you use it, but that’s because of my experiences. 

Again, I mentioned that you CAN use it as a secular analogy, but it feels like an obviously religious story with more meaning being repurposed. I say this because of how trivial the secular message would be. 
In your example of the “society gives me things, I refuse them, I am dying and I blame society” this person is a self-contradictory moron that nobody can relate to. 

In the “I am an employee who hates my job, has chances to leave, but stays and blames my job for me hating it,” this makes it seem as though it’s not the jobs fault he hates it when perhaps it is (poor working conditions, bad company culture). There are valid reasons for working jobs you hate, and people that hate their jobs will basically always take opportunities for a better job they think they would like more anyway, so again it’s pointless. 

In the “I’m sick, refuse doctors, blame doctors for not treating me” example, this is again a self-contradictory moron nobody would relate to.

 My point is, you’re making it seem like the boat story isnt a moral lesson for the person who hears it, but instead a way for people to straw-man other people who complain about things by making it their fault they don’t do something else. So, I think it’s a bad non-religious analogy."

It doesn’t work well for religious people because the ending undermines the moral lesson, but without it, the story wouldn’t appear to carry the moral message on the surface.

At the very least, the analogy has a lot more meaning for a religious person, and takes a lot more guess work and effort de-abstracting it to work for a non-religious person (which to me, makes it a poor analogy).

That being said, I don’t think it actually works for religious people either. What did the guy who sinks ACTUALLY do wrong? His faith DID save him, he went to heaven. In fact, what he did was better than taking the boats, because if he had then there was a chance he may eventually lose his faith while living.

A man is stranded on a desert island. However, he realizes he has all the resources he needs to survive. So, he starts farming, building a shelter, finds a friendly village of other survivors, and eventually discovers that he actually enjoys it even if it’s a bit tough.

 A boat pulls up one day, and the captain yells “I’m hear to save you! Come with me, we’re going to a magical island with the fountain of youth and infinite food and pleasure! It’ll be great!” But the man refuses, he’s not sure he buys it and he’s doing fine on his own island. 

 Another boat shows up, this time with a different captain. “Thank heavens you didn’t go with that other captain, he’s actually heading to a horrible island where there is no food and everything is on fire. However, come with me! We’re going to the actual island with the fountain of youth and whatever else you want on it!” But the man refuses again, now feeling especially validated seeing that these boats don’t really seem to know where they’re going, as they disagree on the right path.

Since then, many other boats show up at the island. It gets a bit tempting to hop on a boat and sail away, hoping for that island with infinite youth and pleasure. But, at the end of the day, with his friends and the fruits of his hard work he feels satisfied that he lived a good life and doesn’t need to live forever.

 Something to note is that she was never supposed to leave. She had to trick her way out. So really, what you wanted was what was supposed to happen, but she was just too bad ass, strong willed, and clever in addition to having a good friend for her to not get her way.

Many Christians believe Jesus IS God. I suppose you could be a Unitarian. But, it doesn't matter whether it is Jesus or God, somebody commanding you love somebody else just as bad.

If God is the one responsible for the good in my life, then I give God all the credit He is due and I thank Him. However, somebody giving you nice things aren't grounds for loving them. If somebody gives you a million dollars and then commands you to love them, you don't owe them love. And without the ability to talk with God to learn about what was meant by this commandment and the other things listed in the post above, I don't know how I would love Him. You are not God.

God commands that you love God as much as possible (with the threat of hell to back it up). I don't think love works like that. Love isn't something you can demand.
