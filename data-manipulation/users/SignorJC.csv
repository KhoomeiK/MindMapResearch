JUST. DO. IT.

AA can book one ways. Lock in that a321 flight right now before it goes away. Then keep looking for the return.

85k is a decent price yes."

There are a lot of hotels in the area. IMO, the Marriott options are severely overpriced (except at the very top end Ritz/etc). The Hyatt options are more fairly priced on points, but they are definitely a ""splurge"" for a special occasion. If you're traveling alone...eh not worth it."

ELATeachers,ffs502w,t1_ffrd13l,1580173283.0,"Just to piggyback on the top comment - this is exactly what I meant in my earlier post. This is a system that does not penalize late work at all, and eliminates (or greatly reduces) the ""free riders"" who want to abuse the system. It forces students to reflect on their practices in order to prevent late work in the future, and escalates in a meaningful way to greater levels of intervention. It communicates clearly with parents and students about their progress in a course.  
  
  
  
Penalizing late work is stupid. Grades should not reflect behavior/compliance. Grades should reflect progression towards mastery of a skill or learning standard. Did the student complete the content? Did the student learn something? In what way does the time in which they completed the work impact the efficacy of what they learned?  
  
  
If the assignment is ""no longer relevant"" because they didn't complete it ""on schedule,"" then something is wrong with your assignment.     
  
  
  
""It doesn't prepare them for the real world with real deadlines."" Wrong and irrelevant. In the ""real world"" people CHOOSE to take on assignments and work. Very few students in your class choose to be there. In the ""real world"" deadlines change all the time or people pad their deadlines so there is always extra time. **The idea that you can perfectly determine the perfect timeline for students to complete work, in a system where you do not control all the pieces (other courses, jobs, family problems, medical issues, specific learning needs), is preposterous.** In my experience, teachers are almost always the opposite - cramming things in to get in at the  end of the marking period with no regard for other courses. In medicine there is triage. In communications fields (advertising, etc), there are ""billable hours"" so that agencies can complete jobs in the order of size, importance, etc. In construction? L O L. Is there any construction project that finishes ""on time?"" Sorry, the ""real world"" is nothing like high school at all and taking 5% off of assignments DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.   
  
  
  
  
That's the absolute worst part of it - what does taking points off (or not accepting) do? It doesn't teach students anything. They don't do the work, so they don't learn. You're gonna sit behind your computer and genuinely type out ""Well this kid came to me and asked to make up the work, but I said NO because it's late and DEADLINES hahaha THE REAL WORLD."" That's ethical? that's in the best interest of the student?    
  
  
  
Create a system for your classroom that promotes student independence and time management. Use a grading system that reflects mastery, not behavior. In my classroom, I will always accept late work, and usually multiple revisions of an assignment (so that it reaches ""proficient"" for that assignment). I will only grade the work if the student contacts me directly and send me an email with a direct link to the work that they completed. I highly suggest that /u/dtbrown101 develop a similar system. Set a clear set of expectations and a clear procedure that minimizes the extra work for you, the teacher. You can set specific days that are your ""make up grading"" days to avoid the chaos of searching for missing work. Thanks for coming to our TED talk."
