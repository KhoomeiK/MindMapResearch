My daily to-do's take a few minutes, I quickly arrange tape/glue in pictures, write down notes while reading ... the only thing that actually takes up time is the art (post-it note, man/woman, January monthly page, woman in the serpentine dress), which I only do every few pages when I'm feeling inspired, usually at night to wind down, with Netflix on in the background."

bulletjournal,ffczc42,t1_ffc8oue,1579810363.0,Not much to be honest! I just do it as I go along and add a few pages a week.

bulletjournal,ffcycc9,t1_ffc4jcc,1579809802.0,"That is awesome!!! This is my third or fourth bullet journal, and they only started getting like this when--same as you--I realized I was getting too structured and too insistent that everything be 'perfect' and functional all the time. Honestly I just try to screenshot and save when I see art that I love, and constantly find myself inspired by films and books—my bullet journal is much more inspired by that than any genuine 'creativity'. But I like that—I can look back and see a reflection on whatever was fascinating me in a certain week and it all sorta ties together :)"

bulletjournal,ffbnfq9,t3_esqxmk,1579774154.0,"Just in case people are curious!

Art on pp. 1, 4-6, 14 and 18 — all cut out of a very old and battered copy of Civilisation by Kenneth Clark (art history book). I got it for £3 at a charity shop and all the art in it will last me through this whole journal for sure.

Washi tape — a lot of it is from the William Morris MT Artist series, also the MT Ex series in encyclopedia. Not sure what brand(s) the map and Leonardo da Vinci notebooks one is from. The 100mm Van Gogh and Raphael School of Athens tapes are my favorite; the brand on the inside says 'Card Lover' and I think they were like $3 on AliExpress or something?? Constantly out of stock but really worth keeping a look out for. Would also recommend (if the price is reasonable) buying sample sizes of washi tapes on Etsy; it's a great way to try new ones without committing to a full roll, and also lets you order more at once without the shipping charge skyrocketing.

Post-it notes, moon stickers — AliExpress. Also really really cheap. Monthly insert is from Muji.

Pens — Muji .38 black gel pen and Pilot V Razor Point Extra Fine for most of the text; sometimes 0.5 uni pin fine line pens in light/dark grey or sepia to vary it up. For drawing, I use .003, .005, .1, .2 and .3 Sakura Pigma Micron pens. Honestly out of all of these I would recommend the Muji.

Markers — that spectrum noir metallic set in precious metals is bomb.

Calligraphy — no expert but I've found the Callicreative italic manuscript pen really good, also Edding calligraphy pens are really great. 2.5 is probably the best for bujo, 5.0 is too big probs. I'm not actually good at calligraphy and probably don't have the patience to learn; whenever I want a fancy heading I plug the text into the Calligraphy font generator on fontmeme (dot) com (using the WatGoth or Magnolia fonts usually) and just copy what I see. Even if it's not exact, the approximation usually looks good enough!

White gel pen — I really love the uniball signo pigment ink in white. Color gel pens are gelly roll moonlight pens. I like them but they're a little bit too neon for my aesthetic so I don't use them as often as I thought I would when I first got them.

Highlighter — I'm so in love with the Mildliner pastel highlighters, especially the grey one. Where have u BEEN all my life.

That's it I think!"
Watercolor,ff5r2di,t3_ertgvw,1579606868.0,"How I did it: did the background first, putting masking fluid on his left side (my right) to protect the outline of his figure. Let that layer dry and stipped a white paint pen on top to give it a galaxy effect. Painted the figure, used fineliner pens in a few places for detail, and used the white paint pen again for his beard. Tada"
bulletjournal,ff5qrmb,t1_ff5pqg8,1579606484.0,I LOVE this explanation. Thank you so much for taking the time to type it out--it's so fascinating to see into how artists' minds work like this :)
bulletjournal,ff5qq06,t3_erk416,1579606426.0,Omg I love this idea.

bulletjournal,fenqlug,t1_fel8y83,1579289364.0,Aww thanks so much!
bulletjournal,femj5ri,t1_felmwlb,1579258264.0,Some other commenters have already pointed out but I got it at Uniqlo! And yes it is the William Morris mt tape :) I'm in love
bulletjournal,femj4ic,t1_felt8ew,1579258213.0,It's usually unrelated! Sometimes it's just a picture of a painting by an artist I really like with my daily to-do lists surrounding it. (I really got into Delacroix and Rembrandt recently so hunted down some old catalog books of their work specifically.) Sometimes if I'm taking notes on a book or a novel I'll try to use a picture whose mood/subject sorta compliments it.

bulletjournal,fellmic,t1_felkgj2,1579225116.0,"It’s not something I usually do either—hence only doing it with very ratty, well loved books that really otherwise probably will not shift or go anywhere lol"
bulletjournal,felev6z,t1_feldx0f,1579220529.0,"I live in the UK so I visit my local Oxfam shop which sells used books, and can usually get good ones for £2 or £3.50, £4 tops! Fancy books that are just illustrations (like coffee table books) are more expensive, but those glossy pages are generally a bit too thick to put into a bujo, and the artworks themselves are huge. What you really want is the high school or college art history textbook or the little guidebook that has a ton of smaller pictures. And these are often way cheaper, comparatively.

You just want to find any used bookstore with an art section basically (Half Price Books in the US for example). I quickly flick through a bunch of the books that grab my attention and think: how many of these pictures could I see myself using? Does it justify the price? Are they all black and white, or are there some color too? Are they the right size (i.e. small enough where I could have room to write on the rest of the page)? Are they too glossy? (I don't really like the look when it's too shiny, prefer it to be normal paper instead.) Or if you don't have a used bookstore in your area, you could try Amazon for used books or AbeBooks. I've only bought a couple so far and I'm sure what I cut out of them will last me through the year.

Sorry this was such a long comment!!"
