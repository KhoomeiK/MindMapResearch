dogs,ffx2fhh,t1_ffwa6ym,1580316304.0,"I down voted because ""powering through"" is for humans, not for animals. I allowed our last dog to ""power through"", only because family did not want her to go yet. I will NEVER do that again!"
dogs,ffx26wv,t1_ffwucv5,1580316157.0,"semiactivist, please do not ever have another animal. Ever! We had a neighbor who did this very thing, and I suffered dearly for that poor dog. They left it in it's outdoor house do die, all alone. No comfort, for days. That was horrible, and I never forgave them for that. Relieving pain and suffering is one of the privileges of pet ownership. I say this because this pet has given us their love, unconditionally, and when they are beyond help, we must step in and do them the kindest thing we can, by saying goodbye and allow them to peacefully go, with the help of modern medicine."

politics,ffjyc6o,t1_ffinhkn,1580010325.0,"Thank you for taking the time to help me understand this a bit better now. I figured they were worried about their seats in upcoming elections, but for the love of everything wonderful, WTAF? Being a relatively sane person, I cannot even fathom being that narcissistic that I would sell out my country for a few more years in the senate. It hurts my brain thinking how they get up in every day and think they are a good person. And yes, how deep does the corruption go? We are such a young country, and to see it being devoured by such blatant in-your-face corruption already is quite sobering, and really, really, scary."
politics,ffjd7zd,t3_ety7kd,1579995821.0,"OK, since you were not born here, nor lived here as long as I have, I will give you a pass on being ignorant about this country, just this once. I love America, and everything it stands for. That is until some rotten human with the blackest of hearts takes control. Now I have soured. I abhor his ""policies"" on separating children from their parents, just because the color of their skin is brown. If you agree with that, then I would prefer you not live here. You do not deserve it. I do not agree with his selling out our country to the Russians. If you do, please exit the United States. You do not deserve to live here. I do not agree with his ""policy"" of firing absolutely anyone who disagrees with him. If you do, you may catch the next flight out of this country. She does not need you. He is a crusty scab on an oozing sore, and he needs to be cut off with the sharpest scalpel and thrown away. He is a narcissistic psychopath, who serves no one but himself, and will hurt anyone who gets in his way. He did not win the election fairly, as he truly lost by millions of votes. I love my country, this United States of America. I was born and raised here. I have a voice. You, however, have not, nor do you seem to have a firm grasp of our politics, nor our way of life. I think it would behoove you to do a lot more research before you put your self righteous nonsense out there for all to see."

politics,ffinhkn,t3_etr7d4,1579978109.0,"So, Ive got kind of a dumb question. Why not throw tRump under the bus and allow Pence to take over? They would still have a Repug at the helm, and Pence is as reprehensible, or worse, than tRump. Then wouldn't the house have to start all over again to try to remove Pence, who we all know is in as deep as tRump? I guess I am just not quite understanding the total blind loyalty to the ugly fat orange one. Is it really all about money? I think I am missing some pieces this really bizarre puzzle.

Dogtraining,ff39ewx,t1_fezr8e9,1579536789.0,"I think as much as it pains you, you are going to have to. He needs to learn the difference. Drinking from puddles is ingrained in him, and it will take a lot of work and patience to retrain his brain. I think, if you can, feeding him canned mixed with dry would be a good choice, as he will get some from that. If that is not feasible, mixing either water or broth in his dry would be an option as well. Also, make him some broth ice cubes, and let him have those? I'm not a fan of giving dogs ice cubes because of the possibility of broken teeth, but in this case he may need them. Also, see if he will eat fresh baby carrots. cut into pieces and let him have a few during the day. also, some apple is good too. Anything with moisture will provide something. If he goes nuts for a fruit or veggie, try putting a piece in his water bowl and see if he will try to get it. Probably not, but anything is worth a try. I know you are in an apartment, is there any way at all he can get his water from a bowl outside? Like near your sliding door? I don't know how cold it is where you are, but maybe bundle up and read while he is near the bowl. I have no idea if any of this will work, all I know is that is that it takes a friggin long time for some doggies to learn new habits. keep at it, and it's ok to cry now and then too. I know I have."
Dogtraining,feywiuv,t3_eqt7b8,1579451386.0,"Our rescue pup is like this as well. So weird. I started leaving bowls in the garage and out by the sliding glass door, as well as in the kitchen where she eats. All different kinds of bowls. She consistently drank out of the stainless bowl that was outside, so I brought that inside and put the ceramic bowl out. The ceramic bowl outside became her favorite, so type of bowl did not matter. I tried all of the previous mentioned ideas, made no difference. She would drink outside. The kicker? We are now traveling, and she is stuck with ONE bowl, a glass one I had in the kitchen, and she is drinking just fine out of it, INSIDE, the goober. The only thing we can figure is that the time spent at different shelters before we got her, she was outside. Either that or she was born on the street. Either way, I am hopeful this time spent inside the RV will break the habit. We will see.
As for your predicament, I would stop chasing him around. That can't be healthy for either of you. 

I don't know if you have worked on ""Leave it!"", but if not, start now. He has to learn the difference between good water and bad. Our girl is just now getting the Leave It command down pretty good, so I am hopeful when we get home it will become useful if she tries to drink any other water but her bowl in the kitchen.

Place his bowl in different areas in the house, leaving it in place for several days. 

If you see him take a drink,wait until he is done, then praise the heck out of him, and give him a treat. Even if it is a tiny little nose sniff. 

That is all I have for now. Good luck, and I hope you two can work this out."

Dogtraining,fe3nrlu,t3_emtc3f,1578851141.0,"So I used the K9 Bridle 3 times yesterday, and just WOW!! All she needed was gentle tugs to remind her to walk nice. Her excitement level was WAY down, and her reactivity when walking near other dogs was minimal. It loosened if she walked nicely, and if she started to pull I just did two little pulls with my pinky and ring finger, and she came right back. Holy cow! She did not exhibit any discomfort, and only fussed at it a few times, as much as she does her harness. I spent a few 5 minute sessions throughout the previous day getting her used to it, using lots of treats and positive reinforcement. I think this is going to be a great tool to teach her to walk nicely, slow down, and pay attention to me. Hopefully I won't have to use it forever, but for right now, I'm sold."
Dogtraining,fe3id1q,t3_enpghw,1578849520.0,"I have a similar issue, and this is what I am working on right now. 

Blue-9 Balance Harness, coupled with Pet safe 2-point control leash. That has been my first step. Then just received the K9 Bridle, used it 3 times after spending 5 sessions with treats and positive reinforcement for fitting, and loving it. 

However, prior to all of this, I found sound videos on youtube and played them quietly for the first few hours, then turned up the volume until she hit her threshold, then backed off slightly. Played trucks, sirens, planes, etc., for about 2 hour sessions every day until she got more comfortable with them. Then I played dogs barking. That was tougher, and still a bit of an issue, but getting better. 

As previous poster suggested, if you can, play in the yard before the walk. And, I NEVER walk my girl without a harness. She is really quick at backing out of her collar.

Watch youtube videos on using the 2-point leash and harness. I like driving her like a horse, turning circles and changing directions. Keeps her focused on me. She has been the most difficult dog I have ever had, but she is so worth it. I just want her to be the best version of herself, and I believe these are the tools to accomplish that. Good luck to you and your fur-baby."

Dogtraining,fdquglb,t3_emtc3f,1578675091.0,"I just got the K9Bridle. I have not used it yet, that will be today, but it really looks like it will work like the bitless bridle I used on my horse. It is not supposed to pull from the side, but stays straight on top. I am really curious how it will work, so I will let you know after I have used it a few times."
reactivedogs,fddyka6,t3_ekfjj5,1578327098.0,"I have stopped being nice over the years. My response would be, and I am not exaggerating: ""Come get your f-ing dog before something bad happens to it, and I mean now""!!! Too many times I have had to protect my dogs from jerks and I will not tolerate it any more. And it is not your dog's fault. I now have a reactive dog, and it is a whole other world. Their brains cannot adjust fast enough to the situation, and I find, at least with my pup, will make knee-jerk responses. Make sure your husband is aware of leash laws, this neighbors carelessness, and that both you and your dog's safety are at risk every time this neighbors dog is loose. Also, both my husband and I carry bear spray with us at all times now."

It has only popped up since we have been on the road traveling. I know she needs more exercise, but this is extremely hard to do in some rv parks. I am hopeful when we get to the place we will be staying for a while it will be better, but to be honest, when in this situation, with scads of dogs barking and jumping to get at her to play, I need more of an immediate help type of response.
