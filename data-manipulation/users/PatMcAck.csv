massage,ffqxwvg,t1_ffqxcrw,1580146123.0,The difference is planning on becoming registered. For us while we are in school we can't be payed to massage otherwise they can cancel our registration (if they find out after we get registered) or refuse to register us (if they find out before and they do ask you). If you are from an unregulated province I highly doubt it's for all intents and purposes the same as the BC one. Most unregulated provinces classes are a couple months and in BC it's a 4 year program.
massage,ffqxde0,t3_eul2ie,1580145780.0,"Palpate all your muscles from beginning to end while you are learning. If you know the muscles action and know how to test the muscle you can always find it on yourself if you can contract it. For muscle innervation it's actually pretty easy, know where the major nerves go and the nerve closest to that muscle is generally the one that innervates it."
massage,ffqwlmh,t3_eukg8r,1580145292.0,So in Ontario this would disqualify you from being able to get your registration and BC is generally a bit more strict than us. Someone from BC is going to have to chime in to know for sure but it's probably going to be a hard no.
massage,ffh6hen,t1_ffh2f9a,1579924450.0,"Well, if you want to look at standards of practice it's generally ""within clients tolerance"" as long as it isn't causing injury. Therefore within our scope of practice but like I said I personally wouldn't be doing it."
massage,ffg1q9i,t3_et8lnv,1579896566.0,Well even if someone had dealt with it your situation is unique. Is their complaint valid? If it is then firing them now looks really bad because it looks like you are retaliating. If not then just fire them and be done with them so you can focus on dealing with your board.
massage,ffb2r44,t3_es9mzb,1579750317.0,"Well there is research out there that actually says that painful treatments for injury are actually more beneficial than non-painful treatments. For this reason the ""nervous system relaxation not being able to relax"" doesn't really hold up. I think massage therapists get a little too wrapped up in the ""global relaxation"" effects of their practice. If a muscle is limiting your range due to tissue stretch, weakness or something else it's okay to treat just that dysfunction.

All that being said I don't think it is necessary to be that aggressive and he probably could have gotten similar results with much less discomfort. I try to keep my treatments under a 6 or 7/10 unless we are really stuck with some sort of chronic issue and if a client is kicking their legs or yelling I know it is too much. On a guy like that I would probably be more aggressive than on someone else but I wouldn't have gone that far."
massage,ff3umbg,t1_ff3shlv,1579549204.0,"Well the problem we see repeatedly in society is that people lack good judgement and make stupid decisions. Not that I'm a fan of the CMTO  but they take a ""one is too many"" approach to sexual abuse and we get regulated to minimize the chances of it occurring. While I think it would be better if we could use our own good judgment I also realize that there are a lot of therapists out there who lack good judgement and therefore the decision is taken out of our hands."
massage,ff3s4ik,t3_eqpra6,1579547663.0,"Without more info it's impossible to say however it is concerning. Diplopia, dizziness (vertigo, light-headedness, giddiness), drop attacks, dysarthria, dysphagia, ataxia of gait, nausea, numbness and nystagmus. are the 5N's and  3D's that are major red flags for us when we treat the neck and head. Having one is no big deal a little nausea could be caused by a lot of things. But if you get three or more on that list you should definitely see a doctor as it could be something serious."
massage,ff3rka6,t1_ff3m698,1579547320.0,"So, there is a massage therapist who lost his license for this in my home town. It somehow came up during a QA check (someone from the CMTO actually comes and sits in on you for a day) and that is a mandatory reporting offence. After he lost his license he took the same stance as you and just continued to practice massage. Well now he is being prosecuted for massaging without a license.

The point is if the clinic owners or her colleagues were to find out they would be forced to report her or they could lose their ability to practice as well. 

In Ontario we can't even treat our spouse/partner. Is it unlikely that you'll ever get reported for it? Sure, unless you break up and someone wants some easy revenge."
massage,ff2wsbg,t3_er4hp0,1579527066.0,I don't know the rules where you live but where I live you can't have a relationship with your therapist for a year otherwise it constitutes sexual abuse and she could lose her license.
todayilearned,fedbw7x,t1_fecoamu,1579007024.0,Yeah we have to screef as well. I generally throw shovel deep and hand screefed on the way out unless it's tougher stuff that needs the boot.
todayilearned,fedbsll,t1_fecozcv,1579006930.0,20 seconds is a pretty slow tree actually. We were planting trays so you need to pull all the trees apart before you can plant them. They were 7 feet apart so it's two steps shovel in the ground Jan your hands in the ground to protect the tree pod and punch it closed. It can be done in about three seconds minimum but that's not a realistic average.
todayilearned,fedb74n,t1_fecz8fs,1579006371.0,I think we had around 45 or 50 working days so the average was much higher than 1k. We were making 12.5 cent per tree so you need to plant fast to make more money. My best day was just shy of $600
todayilearned,fedb1z2,t1_feczqm1,1579006232.0,"A shovel, also 900 trees is like the absolute bare minimum you can plant in a day. I averaged around 3000 and I was far from the fastest planter."
todayilearned,fech0s3,t1_fecgmdj,1578973717.0,"There are automation techniques but they are much lower density than a planter. Sometimes we even get sent in to fill in holes from aerial drops. The problem is because it's so rocky you really need to poke around with a shovel and find the good spots. Since there is actually limited land it's better to pay more and have higher density.

We generally plant 1 year old trees and you essential wedge a hole open with a small shovel bend over put the tree in and punch it closed.

 Could it be automated by an aerial drone for sure but it's going to take a hell of a lot of work and it is going to need to be super precise. Ground drones will get too hung up on fallen trees and random stuff on the ground and it is tough for an aerial drone to know of it's actually planting in soil. Considering a seedling costs about a dollar and your future profits depend on how many trees are in your forest you can't afford to have that many trees be unviable."
todayilearned,fec96ph,t1_fec7h3i,1578968873.0,"I planted over 120,000 over the season (including 4700 in one day) and didn't need any physio. It's way harder on your wrists than it is on your back. I was in school for massage therapy so I was first aid attendant and the most common injuries are wrist/elbow then knee and then back (company wide statistics over a number of years). Injuries happen and people get sore but they usually don't need physio although we do have a clinic we can Skype with if we get injured. We've also implemented mandatory wrist taping for first and second year planters and have found it has greatly reduced wrist injury. Most companies don't have the same resources we do (Brinkman) but just like anything with good technique it is easy to avoid injury."
todayilearned,fec1wv0,t1_febm7v7,1578965436.0,I worked in a camp that planted over 5 million trees last summer. I see all these stats about how many trees countries are planting and I can't help thinking how it really isn't all that much if 60 people can do 5 million in a couple months.
massage,feby9jr,t3_eo80vm,1578964209.0,"Try Outcome Based Massage by Carla-Krystin Andrade, it's a first year textbook at many massage schools in Canada."
massage,feamb3y,t1_fe9y2ow,1578950253.0,"Fractionated coconut oil, holly oil, it really depends on the processing facility TBH. I use a gel made with jojoba, safflower and some other crap. Coconut, jojoba and safflower can all cause allergic reactions but they have the allergens removed during processing.

All that being said if it is just for yourself and you know you aren't allergic use whatever you like the consistency of. If a patient wants me to use their own oil on them I will but I will always wear gloves."
massage,fe9jyfc,t3_enq3rv,1578938468.0,"Generally should go for something hypoallergenic, arganb allergy is pretty common in people with tree nut allergies. This could cause allergic contact dermatitis or potentially anaphylaxis. For most clients it shouldn't be an issue but you are going to have to be more thorough in cleaning for a decent amount of clients."
idlechampions,fe06rw6,t1_fdmehvh,1578804515.0,"If you don't have Zorbu and don't have the evil characters to go with Krond, Jim will probably be your best DPS"
massage,fdspwif,t3_emtnbu,1578706412.0,"So she may have difficulty getting disability because it could be carpal tunnel or could be thoracic outlet. The problem is that these are both common in massage therapists and pregnant women (so you can see how being both would be extra problematic) so workers comp can just claim it's due to pregnancy and out of their hands. This is why many massage therapists have insurance on their own, so no matter what the cause is they have pay if something happens to their hands. That being said she could try but if they deny her I wouldn't start a legal battle because it's unlikely she would win."
massage,fdm8aat,t1_fdlizpy,1578542270.0,"Doesn't change the fact that research says it works in a lot of cases. Manual Therapy, remedial exercise and education are the three pillars of conservative orthopedic treatment and are within the scope of practice of massage therapists. The key in evidence informed practice is to constantly evolve and if you are just rubbing someone's back you aren't being all that effective.

Do you question whether physiotherapy works? Because the scope of practice has tons of overlap so if one works the other must. The biggest differences are in the therapists skill levels."
hardware,fcnotpe,t1_fcmnxmh,1577815593.0,Also depends on the person. 15c is shorts and a t-shirt weather for me.
Amd,fc3vl61,t1_fc3jlzs,1577399751.0,And it had some problems at launch
