PublicFreakout,ffij9cg,t1_ffi034e,1579975189.0,"People are downvoting because that’s an absurd comparison. The plague killed what, a third of the earths population? Coronavirus is hardly lethal unless you are already in bad health. The Wikipedia itself says “lethal in rare cases.” That is not the same as the bubonic plague; death was the rule, not the exception.

A more likely comparison would be swine flu. Mass media coverage trying to scare regular people, but in truth, completely insignificant."
SweatyPalms,ffh5yw9,t1_ffh3s4l,1579924040.0,"Some videos are from on top of the roof with their friends, some are far away from the ground. A couple are gnarly. 

I can usually handle gore and shit just fine. It’s brutal but impersonal, but the one I was referring to wasn’t. Initially she’s laughing as he does a handstand, then suddenly you hear the most terrible and honest blood curdling scream of the girl filming the moment he slips and she realizes her friend/boyfriend is going to die and she is losing him forever. You don’t see him hit the ground, just miss his grip and disappear over the roof’s edge as she suddenly and violently cries in the most horrid scream you can imagine. There’s just no joy in watching something like that. I got chills and the tone got sour and uncomfortable for the remainder of the night. Hug your loved ones. 

I’m convinced it’s a mental illness and delusion of immortality these people have. I said it was stupidity before, but no form of stupidity could convince even the dumbest of idiots to willingly disavow their fears in order to do something like this. The desire to do this has to be some form of sickness. For every video like this post, there’s one that goes wrong. It’s not a matter of if this guy will fall to his death, it’s when. His poor family."

facepalm,fel6fhf,t1_fel5faj,1579215059.0,">No one use 0-100 scale bro. Because it never gets that hot. Temperature at the hottest of days can only maybe reach 50°C.

That’s literally my point. That’s why Fahrenheit is better adapted for outdoor air temps. -10 to 95 is more intuitive than -23 to 37."
facepalm,fel516j,t1_fektrro,1579214206.0,"It gets far below 0°C here. In Illinois where I live it gets down to like -23 and peaks at 35-37. 

In Fahrenheit that’s about -10 to 95. Far more conveniently represented on the 0-100 scale. Maybe where you live the 0-40 is easier to use"
facepalm,fel41v4,t1_fekif4u,1579213603.0,"> I do like that you acknowledge that 0-100 is a decent scale though. Like every metric measurement.

You are confusing base 10 with degrees. Metric is nice because it uses factors of 10 (not 100) so you can easily convert between meters, decimeters, km, Mm, etc. Celsius is measured in degrees, you would never say kilo°C haha. I suppose you could if you wanted to represent 1000 degrees Celsius, but you could just as easily do that with Fahrenheit. 

My point is that for a laymen’s usage of temperature outside, not doing calculations but just getting an idea of the feeling outside, a scale of 0-100 is objectively far more intuitive than the Celsius scale. 

Like I said, we already use relative humidity as a percentage despite not being metric. No regular person uses kg_H20/m^3 _air to talk about humidity. You just use the RH percentage because it’s easier to conceptualize. Why don’t you take issue with that one? Why do we use light years to talk about space instead of meters? Because it’s easier to represent that way."
facepalm,fektit9,t1_fekmu3a,1579207288.0,Maybe not where you live. The US sees those temps every year
facepalm,fekc54i,t3_epha4j,1579196964.0,"Metric is good for most things including science but I still maintain that Fahrenheit is pretty good for everyday air temperature. The scale is essentially 0° (about the coldest it gets) to 100° (about the hottest it gets). It’s actually quite intuitive if you think of it as a percentage.

What’s the temperature? 90°F? Then it’s pretty damn hot. 20° is quite on the cold side. 115° is Arizona desert. Water freezes at 32° which is admittedly awkward but it leaves plenty of room below freezing. The same scale in Celsius is like -17°C and 37°C, far less intuitive unless you’ve grown up learning it. The boiling point of water is a useless point of reference when discussing everyday air temperature.

People forget that units are intentionally designed to be easy to work with for certain applications. 760mmHg was redefined to be 1 atm to make the math easier. 1.66E-27 kg was redefined to be 1 amu. Neither are objectively better, it depends where and how you’re using them.

We also use relative humidity to describe outdoor conditions and that is not metric in any way. In fact, it’s based on a complicated formula, but because it’s intuitive we can understand it and immediately know what it’s like outside."

Damnthatsinteresting,fehzmdc,t1_fegov1h,1579127100.0,"Average wait time is not a per capita measurement. It is an average measure of the time it takes for a person to see the doctor, never is it divided by the number of people (hence the term, per capita). And as the United States has an order of magnitude more large city centers, it’s expected for the wait time to be somewhat higher, or at the very least for population to play a part in that variable, which you naively deny the possibility of. 

This is besides the point however because we know that with a socialized healthcare system the wait times would inevitably be higher than they currently are as it stands. There is no way that a social system would reduce wait times. Look at Medicare in the United States and compare it to the private sector. No contest, it’s a major increase on average us wait time as it is. If Germany or France or the Netherlands or Canada were to switch to private healthcare, wait times would go down. Period. Canadians learned this one the hard way. 

And yes, the United States leads the world in medical research, cancer treatments, life saving surgeries, and medical technology. 

I’m having a laugh at your undeserved smugness. That’s the Europe I know. Enjoy your 50% income tax, and better get in line early for the cancer treatment. Or better yet, come here if you need it."
Damnthatsinteresting,feewaq3,t1_feehguw,1579042596.0,"Please for the love of god, take a minute to read my biased website so you may agree with me. United States destroyed. 

In reality, you’re absorbing biased factoids with about zero critical thinking. 

Think for a moment about the populations of those nations in comparison to the United States. They’re nowhere even close. Don’t you think the fact that the US has 6x the population as some of those euro countries might make a teeny tiny difference? Above 150 million population the US dominates healthcare. Nobody else is even close. And we have 330 million. The only real contender is japan who has shorter wait times, but they’re still under half our population.

Sometimes there’s more to the story than the 1 cherry-picked variable from a website nobody has ever heard of. I guess no attempted refutation of my other points btw."
Damnthatsinteresting,fee5b72,t1_fedn0el,1579026698.0,"America has the highest cancer survival rate, has some of the shortest wait times, and is responsible for a staggering majority of medical research. Likely the drugs you use came from American research paid by American consumers. 

American healthcare is the best in the world if you can afford it. Which my insurance pays the vast majority of the cost, getting bankrupt by a procedure is propaganda they tell you so you’re happy with your abysmal tax rates, high wait times, and cut rate medical technology."

I grew up with them so they have a place in my heart. Ultimately imo, they’re odd, sub standard films with some redeeming qualities. Not at all what the Star Wars fanbase expected and probably not what they deserved. The choreography is great, the music is cool, the plots are decent, and the world building is nice. They ain’t winning any oscars for acting or dialogue though."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdlbnq4,t1_fdjq74d,1578520584.0,"That sounds like a bad objective measure of intelligence. Two people can both think critically but absorb opposing information that was provided to them. 

Isaac newton invented calculus and modern physics, yet he also believed in alchemy and the ability to turn various elements into gold. I doubt any person would accuse him of “lacking the ability to think critically” because he happened to believe some hocus pocus. His math teachers taught him algebra, and his constituents taught him alchemy. Both were probably equally rational in his mind."

When the United States was created, it was of the ideology to remove the people’s dependency on the government. The government displays its inability to function properly on a daily basis. It’s corrupt, it’s ineffective, and it lacks the efficiency and quality of the private sector. People look at problems and see the solution being “more laws, higher taxes, the government will fix it” despite simultaneously displaying their displeasure for the government’s job as it is. It’s lunacy. 

I find it interesting that people are dying from lack of healthcare but I apparently only need a hangnail looked at haha. The USA provides millions of life saving surgeries a year. Paid for by the individuals who need them. Charitable organizations exist for those who can’t pay. If you’d like them to get healthcare, I suggest you donate to them yourself.
