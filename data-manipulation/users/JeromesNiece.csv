The point of your original comment was that the government (and the Fed) is not to be trusted, right? That they lie to maintain the status quo? Can we agree that was your original point?

My reply to you made the points that (1) it's not just the government (or the Fed) that opposes MMT, and (2) Bernie supporters hold paradoxical views on the government. Do you agree that those are what my points were?

Then why was your reply to that comment about whether the Fed is part of the government? *You're* the reason we went down that path. Remember, here's what your reply was to my above two points:

You then interpreted my quoting you of saying ""the government"" as an implicit argument that the Fed isn't in the government. You attack this rather than my main two arguments.
