I'm specifically thinking of those glow in the dark bracelets, that become beautifully radioactive when you knack the thing and release the chemicals. Maybe we can create a little pocket for this bag in which we put a tear. Bonus: I can now become a professional crybaby!"

Minecraftbuilds,fdq71t1,t3_emi73w,1578657625.0,"The shape is great, but the entire thing is a little underdetailed! Add something to the walls, even adding in some stairs to look like small cracks could make a big difference! For the roof too, you can make it a little messy by changing block size or adding in some different grey blocks! You could build a chimney, you could add trapdoors or buttons on exposed log blocks, you could use fence gates as decoration in your fences, just switch the middle one or the two on the outside, both look great! The glass feels a bit out of place, maybe leaving it open, having a trapdoor or again a fence gate would look nicer! Maybe you could add some more stockpiles: a pile of hay, but also adding a trapdoor on a barrel and putting an item in looks quite nice! Maybe you could build a fancy stable under the house area!

I really like the arches you put in, the little extension at the ends of and under the roof are great! The location of the stairs is perfect! Just some extra things you can add :)"

Of course you also shouldn't give them everything; everyone has their boundaries and to have a good relationship they need to be discussed.

Wood can be nice, but you could also play with wool, terracotta or whatever else you like, as long as it's not grey :p

The walls also need some detailing and decorations, and I would make a bigger door! You could make it 3 wide by having two doors and a pillar in between, or you can use spruce trapdoors to make the illusion! You can also use the trapdoors to make even bigger fake doors, then you could have one permanently open so you have easy access and that grand feeling :)"
