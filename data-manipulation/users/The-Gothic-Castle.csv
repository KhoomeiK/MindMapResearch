LonghornNation,feo1wly,t1_fenyp0v,1579294067.0,"I guess the bigger context here is I wasn't acting on my own. I was asked to both reach out to this coworker and set this meeting up by a superior. This project pre-dates my time at the company, and we are nearing the final weeks-months of work on it, but this part in particular is moving really slowly and it's almost all coming down to what this coworker is working on. He also doesn't really take much initiative to reach out to us for feedback, so every meeting has been one I set up, and it's mostly out of necessity because we need things to move quicker.

Anyway, this whole thing is a closed book as far as I am concerned. I apologized to him for the miscommunication but also pointed out that every part of my message to him should have indicated that this was a meeting that should only happen if he, personally, would find it helpful (even to the point of using almost those exact words). There wasn't much nuance to the message. His response, when he was back online, was apologetic and acknowledging of the fact that I did, in fact, make that clear and he misunderstood."
LonghornNation,fenzpqb,t1_fentr96,1579293080.0,"There's more context that I wasn't providing because it wasn't particularly relevant, but basically I was asked by one of the people to whom I report to reach out to this coworker and set up the meeting for everyone (assuming he said he wanted it) when we heard that the regularly scheduled 10 o'clock meeting was cancelled. 

I was specifically told to (1) let him know that we would have availability and (2) ask if he thought it would be helpful to meet. So when he agreed to the meeting, I wanted to communicate those two points to the team."
LonghornNation,fenthpq,t1_fenhyji,1579290595.0,"I get that, but at the same time, why even say yes to the meeting in the first place if one of the crucial qualifiers for having it (that it would be helpful to him) isn't met? It's like

""Hey I'm free to get Chinese food for lunch on Monday, but we should only go if you like Chinese food and are free for lunch on Monday""

""Lunch on Monday works for me.""

Group text: ""Hey guys, Bob says he's cool for Chinese on Monday, so let's meet at the restaurant.""

""Yo wtf man. I never said I liked Chinese food. Stop putting words in my mouth.""

Like, it's not a stretch to take an affirmative response to mean that you agree to what was said. A response that said ""I'm free to meet then, but don't feel like I particularly need it to make more progress"" would make more sense. I probably should have clarified but I don't particularly feel at fault in the situation."
LonghornNation,fenf4r7,t3_epwd3s,1579283347.0,"I just got accused of putting words into a co-worker's mouth... Here is the exchange (over Skype messages so I have the transcript):

Me: Hey [coworker], we just had a cancelled Monday meeting from 10-10:30 related to [big project], which means we would all be able to talk in person about dashboard things. This would only be if you found it useful to have us all together to discuss (and if you are free at that time). Let me know if you want to set something up, otherwise, no worries!

Him: monday at 10 would work for me

Me: Ok, I'll set something up

[I sent an email saying, among other things, [coworker] said it might be helpful to set up a meeting to discuss dashboards in person.]

[Him over messenger to me half an hour later]: why are you putting words into my mouth? I never said it would be helpful to meet in person. not cool.

I'm legitimately at a loss. I'm not sure how **""This would only be if you found it useful to have us all together to discuss""** and ""Let me know if **you want to set something up, otherwise, no worries!**"" can be taken in any other way... You'd also think if he was going to accuse me of putting words in his mouth, he'd go back and read what he agreed to. Truth be told, in the moment, I thought about asking him when he sent his original response to clarify that he would find it helpful to meet, but I didn't because I thought it might come across as condescending to imply he hadn't read and understood my message. I guess I know to do that in the future with him, now.

E: I just sent a response to him saying sorry for the miscommunication, but that I had also made it quite clear in my original messages that this was a meeting that should only happen if he thought it would be helpful, and he sent an apologetic response, so we good. I will still make sure to double check things like this in the future with him though."

But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce myself. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quite happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching the National Championship Game between LSU and Clemson and left it playing to get myself a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the game. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this game still has two minutes to go in the 4th Quarter."

Had to call my grad school's financial services department because I got a letter in the mail saying I had ~$3300 in outstanding ""tuition"" fees on my account. I was willing to pay it, but because I was a Ph.D. student, *they* were actually paying *me*, so I wanted to understand what exactly it was for before I blindly write a check for this large sum of money. 

The woman who I spoke to on the phone was one of the most rude people I've ever talked to in my life. For one, she put me on hold with no warning whatsoever when I was mid sentence trying to explain why I was calling after giving her my information. Then when I actually got the opportunity to ask her my question, she gave me such a short response, ""It's for outstanding tuition fees."" Ok lady, no shit. ""Sorry, I'm just trying to get a better sense of what specifically the fees are for, because my tuition was covered by the university. May I please just have a little more detail on what contributed to that total?""

I didn't get a very good response to that either, but she also was completely incapable of pronouncing the word subsidiary and tried reading it (I assume) like 5 times out loud before eventually not getting it in the end. When I had eventually gotten what information I felt like I could actually ever be able to get out of her, I said ""okay, thanks for your help,"" and she just hung up. No ""goodbye,"" no ""thanks for calling,"" no ""sorry for the misunderstanding. Please let us know if you have any more questions,"" just a dead line.

I don't know how rude, incompetent people like that get jobs where they are responsible for actually talking to people."
