fatlogic,fh7dqcw,t1_fh48qu1,1581326500.0,"Interestingly enough, talking about body weight is such a huge deal among the running community that it’s more positive than most of the stuff I’ve seen here. When I run with larger people (eg park run) they get an outlet to talk about weight loss knowing that the people around them are at another stage in exactly the same journey. You can’t resent people or say they don’t understand when a lot of them just started running a year before you did. You also have people who gain weight after injuries who joke about it. It’s a culture of people that are very open about their size. 

The most interesting thing is that you get bodybuilders who run to strengthen tendons, aid flexibility and so on. Those people can be MASSIVE and they do have problems... but no more or less than other people, just different kinds.

mendrawingwomen,fh5alae,t1_fh519mu,1581286823.0,"Not manipulating. First, she was raised and educated to wield political power. She was legally married to her younger brother and spent a long time in political war with him and his advisors. She was constantly in the public eye and every action she made was treated as some kind of intentional move and manipulation of *someone*. 

Along comes Caeser and Egypt is in this civil war between two siblings. The brother refuses to reason with him and is obviously controlled by power hungry councillors who are using Cleopatra as a way to point Rome away from their own... peccadilloes, I guess. Caeser is a very experienced politician and he has the important task of ensuring Romans stay fed. Rome has been having its own civil problems, and losing grain will make things very dicey. 

So he finally finds a way to meet Cleopatra - or she finds a way to him! Whichever you believe, they met. Now forming an alliance with her triggers the brother and councillors into action. It forces them to show their hands. And at the end of the day, Cleopatra is the heir to the Ptolemy line. It’s the perfect alliance.

Many of the tabloids support each other’s narratives as they are controlled by similar or identical parties with the same divisive agenda. People who scorn one tabloid may not realise that another is just saying the same thing with window dressing. 

Also, the higher ranks of papers have  integrity and are well done,  but are still partisan. The competition between the Indépendant, the Guardian and the Times is real.

Get an app on your phone which tells you a simple workout. Check it. You ONLY have to listen to your phone while you’re there. You don’t need to worry about what other people are doing. The good apps will also tell you how to do each exercise so you know you’re not doing anything wrong. 

There are very few things you can do at gyms that will make people judge you. Seriously. I used to work out in my summer dress and shorts and nobody looked twice. Before that I’d go in my Miffy pyjamas. Everyone is just thinking about themself. 

If an instructor comes up to you, then tell them you’re nervous and they’ll be cool about it. Listen to their advice but be clear about what you don’t want to do. If you don’t want to do spreadeagles and squats and things in silly postures then don’t do them! 

Last thing: get used to just being in the room. Go in, walk for 10 minutes on the treadmill or go for a cycle, and then leave. Get used to being in the space and ease yourself in. Diving in at the deep end is scary! Making yourself at home is easy. 

Take your own water and towel, make sure you wipe down the machines (because not doing it WILL get you glared at) and take some big, obvious headphones so nobody will try to talk to you.
