There are a lot of other countries and peoples who need help, but the best I can do for that is make sure that Americans have what they need, so that we can afford more attention on building up others.  It's not ideal to reach past such huge issues that are a lot closer to home, like healthcare, affordable higher education, etc.  That's why I'm voting for Bernie. He's got that same bird's-eye view of everything and wants the best for everyone, but he's still pushing primarily for the US to pick up its own slack.
