MiddleSchool,fdrsj67,t3_emlv5j,1578689011.0,"Just say ”hey! So I was wondering if you wanted to go out with me! Like on a date!” if you sound confident and go about a kind way, she’d probably accept and go! Of course, it really depends on the person. Try to ask her when she's alone so she just pressured to say yes or no. If she's always with friends then just ask her if you can talk to her for a moment about something. If you know each other somewhat then it makes it a lot easier! If it's some random girl who you thought was cute it might be a 0.1% harder situation. Of course though, it all depends on the girl she is, and the type of person you are."

srilanka,fckdg37,t3_ehk3ld,1577722851.0,"There are so many fake monks out there, he is one of them. They don’t act like real monks, they just be funny and relatable and they get people to donate to them and then they have the ability to influence the people. Of course, drinking too much beer is not good because of the five rules thing, but lord Buddha never said ANYTHING about LGBTQ being bad. Neither did Jesus, since they were friends I believe? So we know he isn’t a real monk, but we cannot say that or we get bad merits, so we just have to know that and carry on.

Please don’t attack me, I have a very Buddhist family that’s where I got all that from. Buddhism is breaking into little pieces anyway, now it really is who and what you believe and put your trust in."
