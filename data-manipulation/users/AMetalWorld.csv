Xenoblade_Chronicles,ff0bq8p,t1_fezviyp,1579467342.0,"This is why the argument for spoilers is a poor one in my eyes. What makes a spoiler spoil something is context. If you can look directly at something and not know what you’re looking at, it isn’t a spoiler. Also, I’m surprised they didn’t go with the obvious spoiler in smash, the big one, that being Shulk’s final. This one is fairly small by comparison"

fireemblem,fetedyc,t1_feta9be,1579374553.0,"Most of the units who kill her are archers. I’ve been trying to do that or keep her out of their range, but she dies at least once in every combat encounter. Hard classic. I’ve never played FE before. I just heard all the fans complaining about how easy this game is, and I’ve played tons of turn based JRPGs. I’ve tried to plan class paths, passives, when to stick with lesser classes for the sake of stats versus when to promote, when to battle vs other options, etc etc. I’m 30 hours in and I’ve spent probably just as much time if not more just researching conflicting opinions and watching people talk about how easy it is, and I feel I’m no closer to understanding any of the strategy in this game than when I started. Less so, if anything. Trying to min/max like I do in every RPG probably doesn’t help. I posted here looking for advice and guidance when I started but everybody just told me how stupid I was and how easy this game is. Revisiting the game after the smash announcement and really struggling to enjoy it again. I barely got 5 chapters in when I started. I really want to like this series, since I’ve heard from many people about how much they love it, but my experience so far has been pretty disheartening. I feel almost no sense of progression whatsoever since I apparently somehow still have no grasp on how this game works. I constantly have to reset/divine pulse every single battle, story or otherwise. It’s true that I chose this since I wanted a challenge, but what makes a challenge fun is the reward that progression brings. I’m still waiting to feel like I have any idea what I’m doing. I know I’m still on the easy shit too... I worry I’m approaching the point where I’ve gimped myself so hard through my lack of knowledge and errors in time/exp management that I won’t be able to progress at all anymore, and will have to abandon this file altogether. I.E My mage at level 4 2 chapters before the timeskip

Appreciate the advice btw"
fireemblem,feta0js,t1_fet87si,1579373166.0,"Okay, but why does she pull the aggro from every unit on the field? I can’t set anything up for her or even get her to attack anybody when she’s constantly getting one shot by 5 enemies at a time. They even ignore all the people on the front lines to target her in the back. I don’t understand how to approach this any differently"
