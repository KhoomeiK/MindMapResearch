SlayerS,ffsk5m6,t1_ffrdf26,1580183701.0,"Hmm I agree somewhat ~ I think martina is more annoying to Lina, BUT she's also the one who actually says something to Lina about how she must love Gourry (and I'm a huge Gourrina shipper). And Lina doesn't deny it in the moment, so that gives Martina a nice big gold star in my book, lol."
SlayerS,ffrd09r,t3_euohk3,1580155526.0,"I've thought Naga and Martina were similar. They both do the ojou-sama laugh (tho Naga's is clearly superior), both are princesses, wear skimpy outfits, and seem to exist simply to drive Lina crazy. Verdict is still out over who is worse, and therefore better, at it."
SlayerS,ffchhjf,t1_ffbo6ma,1579799563.0,Odd question but is winamp still in use/available to download? I used it all the time several years ago on my comp with windows vista xD but that computer has since died and I'll be replacing it. I always had a Slayers skin on mine too!
SlayerS,ff1rcib,t3_eqri39,1579484480.0,"I'd be happy if the ova & movie set came out in the US on bluray. Even in Japan the set still costs the equivalent of $200+

From what I've seen other people post, seasons 1-3 on Japanese BD weren't remastered so it's almost like what's the point. (Unless you simply don't own a DVD player anymore) Maybe the Japanese BD have some extras?"
corgi,feomsol,t3_epi4d5,1579302346.0,I luv the little paw lift/point!
corgi,feo9mkn,t3_epux9t,1579297022.0,"Tell Cosmo I luv him <3
. I have 2 rescue Corgis and they're just the best!!"
SlayerS,fea6pvd,t3_eo1pd2,1578944986.0,"I want one so bad!! 
Of course I only found out about them months too late.

The mouse pad was featured in one of the Rui doujins as well. Lina says it was her lifelong dream to be on a breast mouse pad xD
. Gourry then corrects her saying ""you mean 'breast-less' right??"" And gets (not surprisingly) blasted away."

SlayerS,fdqsv0g,t1_fdplkns,1578674151.0,"That never crossed my mind that Nama in Revolution could be one of the Naga clones, but it actually makes sense. The fact that she seems even more airheaded/forgetful than the actual Naga makes sense too. Clones/copies are never as good as the original; I think that's a pretty common piece of info."
SlayerS,fdc1c4i,t3_ek95cr,1578265186.0,"She's so freaking cute <3 
I wonder if this illustration will be in Dragon magazine as a poster like last year's new year pic?"
SlayerS,fcp4l8s,t1_fcmk62c,1577850283.0," it's still lame that CPM censored that book :/
And reading it flopped still throws me off~ (and I own the actual book too!)"
SlayerS,fclognu,t3_ehsgia,1577752605.0,"I bought half of mine on eBay and half from a used books store... The listing you linked, I'm not sure if they're selling an entire book/paperback, or single comic (which would only be one chapter  and 30ish pages). 

After a quick US eBay search I don't see anyone selling a lot/set of the Super Explosive books unfortunately. Is shipping to the UK that high for 5 books?"
SlayerS,fbznsbu,t1_fbxlc6z,1577253199.0,"Busy enough that I don't feel like doing much else after work and the other stuff, lol
