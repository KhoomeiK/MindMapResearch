Truthfully any scratches aren't too bad as long as I stop him from jumping off, and any scuffs naturally get buffed out with use. So all in all it adds some wear but nothing horrible. As you said, it's meant to be enjoyed rather than protected."
corgi,ffg24tm,t1_fffl84v,1579896816.0,He's usually kind enough to share. When I sit in it he'll usually cradle himself between my legs or he'll climb up my torso and cradle himself between my shoulders and the backrest. It was adorable when he was an 8 lb pup but the bigger he gets the more absurd it feels.
corgi,ffg1wuz,t1_fffzvjn,1579896680.0,Wouldn't work as a computer chair because of leaned back it is. I would call its seating position an ergonomic slouch.  Insanely comfortable but not really suitable for any computer work other than a laptop.

corgi,fffw8j6,t1_fffup4j,1579893166.0,"Can confirm, it's my favorite place to be. When I'm at home I usually have my legs up on the ottoman and Snugs wedges in-between my legs, but I recently found out he hogs the chair when I'm not home."
Skydio,fff3trb,t1_ffcazbw,1579874967.0,"Good stuff! Man the Skydio is incredible. I have one on order and am looking forward to trying it out in the Spring. I'm definitely bringing it to a track day with my Morgan, it should be interesting to see how it keeps up."
Gunpla,ffca9ci,t1_ffc3r0u,1579795079.0,"I keep hoping they make an MG 2.0 with what they learned from the RG. It's kind of wild that the MG is the worst Unicorn, but it's also by far the oldest so I suppose it adds up."
Skydio,ffc5a5v,t3_esluin,1579791852.0,"Looking good! 

Assuming that's your bike, have you tried having the Skydio follow you while riding? I keep wondering how it would do following me at a track day. I know that I can go faster than the Skydio, but if I was on a slower machine and the Skydio had less ground to cover because it was on the inside of the track, I wonder if it'd be able to make something snazzy."

corgi,fdo9jd1,t1_fdnsdbe,1578601231.0,Thanks!  It's short for Snugglebutt. We went with Snugs because it's hard to discipline someone while also calling him Snugglebutt.

hometheater,fde9o5z,t1_fde9gqj,1578334242.0,"I'm trying to do the opposite, which is power on the Denon and have it power on the projector. I went ahead and ordered the receiver to try it out either way though."
hometheater,fde282h,t1_fde1q39,1578329530.0,"Expensive yes, heirloom no. That's kind of the tricky part of it, haha.

I looked at some AV cabinet fans to hook up to the back to constantly have airflow in that compartment, but I'm worried with how hot the projector runs... Something tells me the smart thing to do is calm myself and just wait for another UST generation before doing anything too silly, but I just love tweaking with stuff haha."
hometheater,fde0hvj,t1_fddzww9,1578328399.0,"To me the projector image is already higher than I want it to be, so that's a no-go on that unfortunately. But to accomplish a similar thing, I have been playing with the idea of sinking the projector into the media console and adding a glass top, so that a larger center channel could sit on top of it as long as it didn't reach far enough to hit the projector.

I'm reluctant to do that for sake of not altering the furniture, but I feel like I'm so close yet so far from a nice setup here.  I really appreciate your thoughts on this!"
hometheater,fddxkta,t1_fddut9q,1578326423.0,"I was kind of joking about Klipsch specifically because of that flair, haha.  I guess it's mostly that I have some and am comfortable with them, and they have the nicest looking thin center channel I've found.  I did look at KEF T301c for the center but I guess I wanted something with just a little bit more character than a big black mesh brick. I know aesthetics really should be at the bottom of the list for speaker selection, but hey, I'm imperfect.

[In case it's helpful, here's a photo of my setup.](https://i.imgur.com/0E80TWa.jpg) I've thought about it but can't quite figure out how I could wedge a larger center behind the projector. The black bit is a floor rising screen so I only have a couple inches between the rear of the projector and front of the screen."
hometheater,fddozdx,t1_fddoqxb,1578320007.0,"I have one, it can't control my projector. My current way to use Harmony to power on and off my projector is use IFTTT to control a little button-pushing robot to hit the power button. It works 95% of the time but is janky and I'd love to have a more streamlined way to do it."
hometheater,fddnzho,t1_fddlqqm,1578319133.0,"Thanks! The receiver is becoming a real sticking point for me since it seems Denon isn't the best option. One critically important feature for me is the receiver being able to reliably power on and off the display device via CEC, and it seems like CEC is a bit of a mess with Denon receivers (to be fair, CEC is largely garbage EVERYWHERE)."
hometheater,fddlihl,t3_eklydg,1578316831.0,"For what it's worth, I have the Wemax A300 (flagship/highest end Xiaomi ecosystem projector) and couldn't be happier. On impulse I bought an Optoma P1 to replace it but after getting them side-by-side I wound up returning the P1 since I found the A300 to be better in a lot of respects.  My only disappointment with the A300 is no IR remote support, so incorporating it into a universal remote setup had some jankiness to it, but I'm hoping to fix that by using CEC on a receiver to turn it on and off.

ALR screens work fantastically. My setup uses a Vividstorm floor rising screen and 99% of the time we are watching it with all of the lights on in our place.  [Here's a video I made a while back to show the difference of wall vs ALR screen.](https://streamable.com/c4f9w)"

projectors,fcxcg60,t1_fcxauxc,1578059123.0,"It just doesn't work reliably. 99% of use of the projector is with a Roku and I could only get CEC to turn it on maybe 10% of the time.

Oddly enough I recently got a Switch and 100% of the time I put it in the dock, the projector turns on, leading me to think it's a Roku issue rather than projector issue. I'm hoping to move towards a receiver in the near future and that hopefully would eliminate all issues.

The button pushing robot is hilarious but has been shockingly effective. I'd say one out of every 50+ times it doesn't work quite right but I have a button on my Harmony assigned to it that is a sort of ""fix it"" button.
