I’m currently looking for a winter tent that can fit 5 people (my wife, myself, and our two big dogs both roughly 60-80lbs in weight). An extra point would be for it to be light/pack able enough to go backpacking. I’ve taken several trips recently (smoky mountains in Dec, Cheaha State Park This month) and found that our tent (6 person Coleman) sucks in anything under 40 degrees and is just way to bulky for anything other then car camping. I’m relatively new to camping and any tent suggestions or reputable brands to look at would be appreciated."
