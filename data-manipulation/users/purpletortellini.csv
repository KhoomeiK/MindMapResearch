Parenting,ff8vmzw,t1_ff8a0dy,1579697618.0,What a beautiful story. Thank you for sharing this!!
marvelstudios,ff77exh,t1_ff73cak,1579642597.0,"In this subreddit, it is!"
bulletjournal,ff5uo4i,t1_ff5re7o,1579610863.0,"Not a lotion, but I buy packs of Stridex (salicylic acid pads) in the red box, it works miracles for me and you can get 100 pads for $5. I wipe a light layer over my face after cleansing, let it sit, rinse off, and then moisturize. The only gripe I have is the fragrance (it's low on the ingredients list tho) which can irritate your skin if you're sensitive to it. YMMV

EDIT: grammar."
Drugs,ff3bee5,t3_erbze0,1579537869.0,"Can we keep r/trees out of all this bullshit? I hate orange man as much as the next stoner, which is exactly why I don't want to be reminded of him every 5 seconds I'm scrolling on Reddit."
offmychest,fejsxtg,t3_epf4v0,1579185073.0,It's awful that you have to feel as though you can't talk about it. Overcoming an addiction is one of the most difficult feats anyone could face! I just don't understand how one looks down on that. I'm proud of you and look up to you.
offmychest,fed767q,t1_fecpewn,1579002083.0,"My mother used to defend her abuse towards my siblings and I by saying, ""other people have it worse."" I pretty much lived by that growing up. I think I used it to cope.

But, that invalidates everything I experienced and is currently still affecting me. I don't believe in comparing tragedies anymore."
DoesAnybodyElse,fdozjfw,t1_fdorngm,1578616459.0,This has been the biggest disappointment for me. The corporate push has been rough
offmychest,fcopj3d,t3_ei8td2,1577838151.0,"Is this really something you needed to get off your chest?

Also, as a former alcoholic, I never got ""triggered"" when someone told me they didn't drink. What?"
sex,fbpcz1s,t1_fbo56nx,1577019850.0,"My SO was a virgin when I started dating him because of this. Quitting porn did not make it happen overnight. Fortunately, I was persistent in helping him over the course of the next few weeks. Now our sex life is fantastic.

Don't give up. It could very well be the porn."
