Kava,ffe7tu3,t3_et4jmg,1579839044.0,"I did a bit of digging on the subject when I started using kava regularly and while I'm certainly no expert my search led me to those claims appearing unsubstantiated by any studies and supposedly based off of some isolated incidents in europe in the 80s/90s that were likely due to adulterated products or low quality kava with other hepatoxic plants parts (leaves and stems of the kava plant have harmful alkaloids but the root doesn't) besides the root blended in. Again I can't say anything with certainty but it seems very likely to be a myth. Anecdotally I've been using it daily, with breaks every month or two, for about a year and haven't noticed any side effects."
CBD,ffe6rqe,t3_et0ksb,1579838204.0,To think that someone likely gets paid a good amount of taxpayer money to write this shit.. Sad stuff.
CBD,ffe69wm,t3_et24et,1579837821.0,Damn guess its time to try Lazarus next time I run out
hempflowers,ffctdmc,t1_ffbv4ht,1579806866.0,Goddamn DMT really is in everything there's even trace amounts in hemp-forums now
PsychedelicTherapy,ffbc0h2,t3_esnyy7,1579759094.0,"I've been there and have had those arguments with friends before, it can be rough. I ended up either being cut off by those friends or drifting apart over time and to be honest I don't miss them. It sucked at the time but I eventually found new friends who could understand and relate with me on the subject and many other interests. Overall they are just better friends for me than the people who told me I was turning into a druggie/burnout, and it sounds like you may be in a similar situation, maybe not though.

I would never recommend you decide your friends based on which drugs they do but if people judge you for choices that don't affect them and don't negatively affect you in any obvious way then that only serves to drag you down. You don't deserve that. I think you have the right mindset to use psychedelics responsibly, unfortunately some people don't understand the concept of responsible drug use due to propaganda/stigma. Definitely put your responsibilities first and as long as your ""shit is together"" then you should be able to make your own decisions. They shouldn't judge your character even if they don't understand. I would not talk about it much if you don't want to strain the relationships as they can't be forced to understand but may change in their own time. If they won't back off the topic after you do then you might be better off without them. Either way since you're in school I'd assume you're young and it is very likely that you will find new friends who relate to you on this or your friends may adapt a more mature viewpoint down the road so this won't be a permanent problem."
nosurf,ffbaxzi,t1_ffb0ip6,1579757961.0,Fair enough. I'm familiar with some of it and the way it was phrased in the OP seems like a poor explanation of that and more attacking the character of addicts but I'll give the benefit of the doubt since he says he does actually help most of his clients. Personally that's not the approach I prefer to addiction/treatment for my own issues but everyone is different and I'm sure it is helpful to many.
nosurf,ffaymla,t3_eskh2p,1579747517.0,For someone who works with drug addicts you sound super judgemental. The internet is addicting for sure but is calling addicts insane and stupid really helpful?
hempflowers,ff9tekg,t1_ff9fy2r,1579720861.0,Yea the best description of cbg ive seen is its like if coffee was a cannabinoid lol definitely good for daytime use more so than cbd for me.
hempflowers,ff8i6p1,t1_ff7tdox,1579679609.0,Ooo that is a good way to describe it I've been trying to figure out how to explain the slightly stimulating feeling I get from cbg
hempflowers,ff8huu5,t3_es71xn,1579679177.0,"Tbh for a $35 oz that looks alright to me, maybe the picture doesn't do it justice though? It's not budporn quality but I only see a little bit of what I'd buy as ""smalls"", most of it looks like small-ish-medium nugs. Either way the price is right at least."
CBD,ff88fbn,t3_es6qnt,1579669011.0,"250mg in 60 ml is a very small amount. That's about 4.2mg/ml so you got maybe 8mg of cbd, maybe less since most vape juices aren't labeled accurately. 8mg over 8 hours is basically nothing and vape juice is made with cbd isolate which doesn't work as well as a full-spectrum product anyway. If you want to vape I'd look into getting distillate cartridges or getting hemp flower and a dry herb vape which is the cheapest option after the initial investment in a decent vaporizer. CBD ecig juice is just not a good way to consume it unfortunately I had to learn that the hard way too."
hempflowers,ff86oxl,t1_ff854r6,1579667525.0,Thanks! Makes sense

Edit: Just tried it out. Definitely has nice effects. I haven't tried a cartridge since I started using flower like a year ago and only had tried a couple brands but among those this is easily the best. Gonna be nice to have when I'm out n about and using flower isn't practical."

Petioles,ff7fpt8,t3_erzyd7,1579648496.0,"I've tripped in dreams a few times, even blasted off on DMT once in a dream. Its great I get to sleep and feel like I just got free drugs lol."
selfimprovement,ff4dzox,t1_ff2vs4w,1579561359.0,Yea I was gonna say just get a bunch of coke and xanax and youll be carefree in no time. No judgement I'm a musician and have done my fair share of drugs but I wouldn't recommend it as a way of life to aspire to.
Kava,ff4d6br,t3_er5rrc,1579560820.0,Yea some strains taste better than others and I think mello mello is one of the better ones but I agree they all taste better than kratom. In a culture where getting fucked up on shots of liquor or drinking super hoppy bitter IPAs is the norm I think kava is one of the more tolerable intoxicants ive used. Not sure where all the disgust comes from either.
leaves,ff4b6se,t1_ff46go4,1579559539.0,"Definitely, what was also very strange after I stopped was hanging out with my stoner friends again and getting to see how it affects people from a sober perspective.. A few of them have issues drinking too and use weed to avoid drinking (at least that's what they say) and while they are definitely worse to be around when they drink they would talk about how good it felt to be sober when they were far from it and seemed to just be rationalizing a different addiction."
leaves,ff463b0,t3_erjj7l,1579556354.0,"In my experience the danger with weed is partially because its relatively benign compared to the majority of drugs. It is physically less addictive than most drugs and causes fewer immediate side effects which makes it easier to rationalize abusing it. You can use it daily and still function for the most part, that is until you can't. The damage it does to you sneaks up on you as it happens slowly and since you're high you can ignore it for years. I'd say comparing it to alcohol or heroin is like comparing apples to oranges. From a traditional perspective alcohol and opiates are far more addictive than weed, there's not much of a debate and the older generation is going off of propaganda not facts. They all have potential to cause major damage though, just in different ways."
socialskills,ff2epds,t1_ff23jdc,1579503045.0,"I think if you can integrate the abuse experience and move past it then its possible to grow stronger/be less afraid in social situations knowing you've survived far worse than anything that'll likely happen at your work party or whatever event. Before any integration/processing of the trauma or being in active abuse is certainly detrimental though and in severe enough cases may never allow the victim to move past it, so it depends really."
howtonotgiveafuck,ff0tmxr,t1_fewuxym,1579472173.0,"It is not the nature of power but the nature of being in certain positions of power. I'm not trying to defend osho I think you misunderstand me. I'm saying its damn near impossible to be viewed as an enlightened guru by thousands/millions and not let that go to your head and be corrupted by it, its human nature. Look up the book ""the guru papers"" if this is actually something you are interested in its too much for me to explain on reddit."
howtonotgiveafuck,fewgy31,t1_fet7yyo,1579410407.0,"Its the nature of being in a position of power to become corrupted. Its not entirely his fault (not excusing or being an apologist to be clear) as if you or I were in a position of being idolized to that extent its very likely we would get ourselves into trouble too, regardless of how good our teachings or intentions were."
selfimprovement,feqrbmp,t3_eqcwqy,1579345120.0,"So first off would be to take care of yourself physically, (diet, exercise, meditation, hygiene, cleaning your living space) even though it's a pain in the ass and you probably don't want to or think it matters because you don't love yourself. You kind of have to jump-start your brain into feeling positive emotion since your brain isn't wired for them if you rarely feel them.

The second would be to pick up an old hobby or maybe something new that seems at least mildly interesting to you. Give yourself something productive to do in your spare time that can build your confidence as you get better and teach you a skill that strengthens your mind. For me it's music and rock climbing at the moment. It helps intentionally spending your time on something positive to do instead of getting stuck in your own thought loops or doing things that you regret later.

The last for now is to let yourself shift focus to process based instead of results based. Enjoy the process of learning, fucking up, improving, and doing new things instead of fixating on if you'll be good enough or succeed. Give yourself the gift of patience, it's okay if you don't become Picasso after 1 painting. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks, and conversely people will likely enjoy you being your authentic self more than actions coming from a place of insecurity.

Do your best in everything you do and whatever the results will be is what the results will be. Essentially learning that the journey is the destination, as cliche or corny as that may sound. Learning that its okay to be the flawed mess of a human being that you are (everyone else is too btw) and still be worthy of love. It takes time and effort, you have to practice. An example would be interrupting negative trains of thought or self criticisms and literally think or speak, ""No, I love myself"". It's  just like any other skill, but it's totally possible to learn and If I can do it so can you!"

hempflowers,feqijzl,t3_eqcu4r,1579342264.0,"I love making salads. Personally only notice subtle differences between strains but I notice pretty clearly that combining strains always give me a more full enjoyable experience, like a shotgun peppering my brain with feelings of calm and being uplifted."
pornfree,fepgjmf,t1_feovaob,1579319937.0,Personally I think the label is appropriate but we need to de-stigmatize the term because you can still be a great person and have a mental illness. Many also suffer in silence because of the fear of being given what society perceives as a negative label. Addiction is classified as a mental illness so it's not wrong it just doesn't have to be a term of insult.
pornfree,fepg44o,t1_feod49i,1579319635.0,"Or we could stop stigmatizing the words mentally ill. Stigmatizing the label is what makes it a disrespectful label and is why many ""mentally ill"" people suffer in silence for fear of the label.

Kava,feok1uo,t3_eq7nkh,1579301265.0,"Just mix it with water, I prefer cold. Could add lemon/lime juice for flavor if you want and start with 1 tblsp on an empty stomach or at least close to it. If its your first time look up the reverse tolerance of kava as it might take more to feel it initially. Bula!"
selfimprovement,feo8jt7,t3_eq31d2,1579296591.0,"I've noticed benefits from doing it and am on the fence about just masturbating being bad (I think its up to each individual to determine how it effects them, generally I feel better not doing it) but certainly feel that porn addiction can be a real problem. The initial idea of nofap, afaik, was to quit porn and masturbation for at least 90 days to break away from porn and then go back to masturbation in moderation if you want. 

The whole concept gets a bad rap from all the loons who take it too far rambling about being gods among men and spewing psuedo-science about semen retention n whatnot. The sub itself has a lot of cringey stuff but there are some diamonds in the rough IMO and can be helpful if you can ignore the other shit."
CBD,feo0gam,t1_fenasrf,1579293494.0,"Yep most cost effective is for sure just getting quality hemp flower to smoke/vape or make your own tincture/edibles. Lazarus (or cdbdistillery which is barely more expensive but uses co2 to extract which is supposedly better than ethanol, both good companies) is your best bet if you don't want any legwork on your end."
hempflowers,fenqt3z,t3_eq2nqs,1579289478.0,I have noticed stronger clouds on the first 3-5 good hits of my solo 2 as well but I still feel like I'm getting something in the last half. I wonder what the explanation would be or if its just because hemp breeding is 20+ years behind THC strains so it can't compare to top shelf yet.
CBDhempBuds,fem2cl3,t3_epuswq,1579237465.0,Mold prefers growing in the buds where there's more moisture so its pretty unlikely to only be on a stem.
Petioles,felw6jc,t1_fekz0tw,1579232455.0,Try actually hemp flower or hemp flower based edibles. Isolates and tinctures/capsules are pretty hit or miss depending on the person/brand.
NoFap,felvtlg,t1_felb51s,1579232196.0,Sure relationships aren't fairy tales. They take hard work and there's gonna be speed bumps but its definitely possible to have a fulfilling relationship that adds value to your life despite what the internet and hookup culture would have you believe.
NoFap,feluq4b,t1_fek30w5,1579231411.0,"Its a catch 22, but the solution is to do them anyway because the energy and motivation often come from taking action. Kinda gotta jump start your brain into feeling positive emotions."

getdisciplined,fei0hnj,t3_ep5amg,1579127622.0,"Good post. It really is dangerous how they mix in really valuable knowledge with some delusional things that make it hard to see the danger. Like the reality is an illusion aspect. One could argue with our scientific knowledge of the world that reality is an illusion. Its all filtered through our brain/perception and what we see is not what the world looks like when you break it down to atomic/subatomic levels, and that's true. 

Then its taken a step further and used as a reason why the laws of physics no longer apply to us, cherry picking science they want to use to back up their claims as they simultaneously bash the limitations of science when something doesn't fit their worldview. Its a sneaky slight of hand that I've certainly fallen for before, and far from their only one. Good to know other people have seen through it too."

NoFap,fe1bytu,t1_fdyjo9x,1578824793.0,"I need to get that light back. I've had 2 actual long-ish streaks of 30ish days and 60ish days that were noticeably benefiting me and since I broke my longest streak this summer after a fallout with some friends I've let myself slide. I go 1-10 days which doesn't bring out the benefits for me and at some point I give in to my nihilistic tendencies. I know it's not an accurate/useful perception but it takes a lot less effort to live in moment to moment. Time to start caring about myself again. Even at it's best this lifestyle of apathy and underachieving is boring monotony, self-loathing self-destruction at it's worst. With that as a starting point I really don't have much to lose.

Ever since I've learned about nofap I can't even really enjoy pmo anyway, or maybe I'm now more aware and never actually did. It never leaves me feeling good about the decision and in the back of my mind I'm berating myself and feeling pretty gross about what I'm seeing. It's a no-win battle with my own psyche. All around an objectively dumb habit really. I know all this already but maybe articulating it will start to solidify new pathways in my brain and remind me how pointless caving in to urges is. Okay end of my rambling thanks for reading if you made it this far, time for us to live our true potential!"

hempflowers,fcsoqrm,t3_eimtcn,1577921292.0,Just got some of this a few days ago too so far I'm digging it. I tried vaping it by itself first and honestly didn't get much from it but then tried mixing it with cbd bud and it definitely synergizes well!

Definitely taking an extended break (hopefully won't feel the need to take again) at least long enough to find my baseline and try some other methods of improving my mental health. Withdrawals weren't horrific for me so far but not fun either so definitely an eye opener that this stuff is more addictive than most claim.
