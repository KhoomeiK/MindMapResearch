BlackPeopleTwitter,feqxtun,t1_feqvyjy,1579347328.0,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching

>The origins of the word ""lynch"" are obscure, but it likely originated during the American revolution. The verb comes from the phrase ""Lynch Law"", a term for a punishment without trial. Two Americans during this era are generally credited for coining the phrase: Charles Lynch (1736–1796) and William Lynch (1742–1820), who both lived in Virginia in the 1780s. Charles Lynch is more likely to have coined the phrase, as he was known to have used the term in 1782, while William Lynch is not known to have used the term until much later. There is no evidence that death was imposed as a punishment by either of the two men.[5] In 1782, Charles Lynch wrote that his assistant had administered ""Lynchs law"" to Tories ""for Dealing with the negroes &c.""[6]

The term was coined in America. The word is tied into American history and was immediately used to terrorize black people. Don't fuck wit me.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States
>Lynchings in the United States rose in number after the American Civil War in the late 19th century, following the emancipation of slaves; they declined in the 1930s. Most lynchings were of African-American men in the Southern United States, but women and non-blacks were also lynched, not always in the South. White lynchings of blacks also occurred in the Midwestern United States and the border states, especially during the 20th-century Great Migration of blacks out of the Southern United States. The purpose was to enforce white supremacy and intimidate blacks through racial terrorism.

While community members acting without a trial is found throughout history and the world, a ""lynch mob"" is a method for racial terrorists.

>After Hayes Turner was murdered, his distraught wife Mary, who was eight months pregnant, publicly denounced her husband's lynching. She denied that her husband had been involved in Smith's killing, and threatened to have members of the mob arrested. The mob turned against her, determined to ""teach her a lesson"".[7] Although she fled, Mary Turner was captured at noon on May 19.[1][7] The mob of several hundred took her to the bank in Brooks County near Folsom Bridge, over the Little River, which forms the border with Lowndes County.[7][2]

>According to investigator Walter F. White of the NAACP, Mary Turner was tied and hung upside down by the ankles, her clothes soaked with gasoline, and burned from her body. Her belly was slit open with a knife like those used ""in splitting hogs.""[7] Her ""unborn babe"" fell to the ground and gave ""two feeble cries.""[7] Its head was crushed by a member of the mob with his heel, and the crowd shot hundreds of bullets into Turner's body.[7][2][11] Mary Turner was cut down and buried with her child near the tree, with a whiskey bottle marking the grave.[1]

This is nothing like suicide. A lynch mob is genocide with a dogwhistle name. Getting called out for your racist/sexist comments and killing yourself is nothing like having your unborn babe ripped from your womb, it's head crushed- all because you dared to call out white men for murdering your husband.

Edit to add: I am so fucking enraged over your comment. All the pain and terror of a lynch mob and you people compare it to getting called out for racist/sexist shit you said?
