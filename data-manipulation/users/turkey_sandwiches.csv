EngineeringPorn,ffplix6,t1_ffph6xu,1580098023.0,That's the exact opposite of your last sentence.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffphg4y,t1_ffp2y0z,1580095128.0,The early reports I saw this morning all said 5.
EngineeringPorn,ffph45n,t1_ffoylac,1580094904.0,Sounds like Airbus might find some of that external expertise in the yachting industry.
EDC,ffnyfsn,t1_ffnqhp1,1580072242.0,"Well, I guess I should stop complaining that my commute recently went from 15 to 20 minutes."
EDC,ffhytsf,t1_ffhwg4b,1579959649.0,"That knife is a Benchmade Triage, and that's the stock clip."
flashlight,fffd01n,t1_fff4kg8,1579881248.0,"Normally that's true of Nitecore but this one is a straight up design copy. People have asked whether there was collaboration between the two companies, and I withheld judgement waiting for an answer, but with nothing being said on that front I have to assume it's ripped off."
flashlight,fff2x8q,t1_fff29il,1579874262.0,I've seen that but the ripped off nature of the light leaves a bad taste in my mouth for Nitecore.
flashlight,fff1l87,t1_fff0v5x,1579873186.0,"I'm loving that magnetic bottom, it's a great feature. I do use a light fairly often to get around the house at night so a low output is always welcome. That's why I'll probably end up with another RovyVon, but if there's another version of the Glow with a low mode I'll probably snatch it up too."
flashlight,ffex7pg,t1_ffex4a0,1579869155.0,One way to find out :) Thanks!
flashlight,ffex6l3,t1_ffe3ngu,1579869125.0,Good suggestion on the Lumintop Glow. If it had multiple modes I would order it right away. Still considering it though.
flashlight,ffex2qu,t1_ffe0m8f,1579869016.0,Will it run indefinitely until the battery pack runs out?
flashlight,ffdy3ar,t1_ffduucn,1579831797.0,"The only thing keeping me from going that route (again, lost my first one) is they can't run off of a battery pack like the Elf."
gaming,ffdvdne,t3_esy5js,1579829869.0,I've played enough GTA to know that you've completely fucked this up. You're not done until something gets launched into the stratosphere.
Damnthatsinteresting,ffduv8z,t3_eswk5e,1579829504.0,Impressive resolution and color from a picture that old.

worldnews,ff53wvu,t1_ff4wy4l,1579579535.0,"Come on man, that's a ridiculous argument. I hope Trump gets his sorry ass handed to him, but lying under oath and obstruction are illegal. If Trump deserves it, so did Clinton. Doesn't matter what he lied about."
Conservative,ff4rj13,t3_eriw3f,1579570710.0,Weren't guns banned from the rally?

news,feicdsw,t1_fegtn8c,1579135217.0,"DOM tubing is strong, but piping still isn't a barrel. 

The whole point of this discussion is that barrels are harder to make than the receiver, and that is clearly the case."
news,feic8sf,t1_feh7lms,1579135122.0,I know how barrels are made and button rifling is the cheapest and easiest method. Still never known anyone who could do it at home. Do you?
worldnews,feibtm2,t1_fehlzz8,1579134842.0,"No, that's not a fact. Iran's retaliatory attack came after we assassinated an Iranian. It's that simple."
worldnews,fegg4tw,t1_fefv9vp,1579091634.0,More projecting. Trump assassinated an Iranian general which started this whole thing. No reason to try and change reality unless you know you're wrong.
news,fegfzr4,t1_fefgpo0,1579091494.0,A pipe is not going to stand up to the pressures inside a rifle barrel. There's a reason they're made strong.

carporn,fee5l23,t1_fee4i7h,1579026863.0,"If it was a fleet vehicle or something it was almost certainly the 2.7, the 3.5's are unfortunately a nice jump in cost. I may eventually trade my Mustang for a 3.5 F150, if I could get it in a manual transmission I would've never bought the Mustang. My two young kids would've appreciated that."
carporn,fee2mwe,t1_fedp0y9,1579025118.0,"We're you driving a 2.7 or a 3.5? The 2.7's are way more common, and definitely lower on power."
carporn,fedit22,t1_fedhxno,1579012613.0,"Yah, but I'd rather have better power, torque, mileage, and much cheaper and easier upgrade opportunities than the sound."

EDC,fec1mk7,t1_feapm9n,1578965333.0,Not an issue at any college I've ever been to. Most colleges and universities are not the extreme-liberal training grounds many would have you believe. I saw more extreme conservatives than liberals in my time there.

ThatLookedExpensive,fdzvykc,t1_fdzven8,1578797097.0,Or they're like me and expect the company to take responsibility for its fuckups.
EDC,fdyagjv,t1_fdx9slg,1578777703.0,Yeah but I doubt that would cause someone to develop conspiracy theories about them like this.

EDC,fdwmlqr,t1_fdwlypv,1578760262.0,I wish somebody would force me to pay a group who would get me higher pay and more time off while protecting me from bullshit moves by upper management.

CCW,fdhhyxj,t1_fdhgqle,1578423035.0,I'm telling you why people have an issue with the naming. It's used to misread the data.
CCW,fdhezcd,t1_fdh53ax,1578421239.0,That's exactly how the statistics are used. That's the problem.
CCW,fdgysfi,t1_fdgwo7b,1578411613.0,"The problem is that loosely labelling things that way leads to misuse of the statistics. Any crime involving a gun becomes a gun crime, whether that gun was used or not, whether the criminal used a gun or the police did etc. 

So we end up with seemingly huge numbers of gun crimes that don't reflect reality."
Leatherman,fdgn7f6,t1_fdgi8p0,1578402918.0,The L will fit only 1 bit kit.

IdiotsInCars,fd9y8sn,t1_fd9x20f,1578239486.0,"The 350 makes less torque down low, but more power up top. Neither are very significant differences, but that's how it is."
IdiotsInCars,fd9xw6t,t1_fd9wxpk,1578239352.0,Mostly because the chassis hadn't changed in about 40 years and it was designed for a live axle. The new chassis can handle both a live axle or independent suspension.

CCW,fcvlgjb,t1_fcuz10f,1578004638.0,Because other people are voters. We're concerned about middle of the road people here. People who already think guns are Satan aren't going to see the other side anyway.
EDC,fcrcnrr,t1_fcr6ri2,1577900041.0,This is the correct answer. It's disappointing to see it downvoted.
