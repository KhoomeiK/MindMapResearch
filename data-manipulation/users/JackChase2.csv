h3h3productions,ffidw3i,t3_etpi98,1579971538.0,"That's really a good idea. They're super busy, but they're always trying to promote their stuff and they live in LA too. Not to mention also being in the same genre of YouTube for the most part."

nottheonion,ffelav4,t1_ffefwwi,1579852864.0,"Yeah, I'm far from some socialists hating anarco-capitalist, but anyone who payed attention to high school history class will know, the government not giving banks bailouts isn't a good thing. 

Who could've guess instability among the organizations that hold all your money could be negative?"
MinecraftMemes,ffekwxy,t1_ffckrqg,1579852366.0,"I recently went though a major gear upgrading phase so it's gotten to the point I keep a spare silk pickaxe on me in addition to my looting one. Living the life, I tell you."
MinecraftMemes,ffekue5,t1_ffd5jwe,1579852277.0,"If you own a survival world you should do whatever the hell you want. It's you're world, you have the right to do what you feel is best."
skyrim,ffekq91,t1_ffeduuz,1579852127.0,"I don't know about you're situation, but I can tell you I had the same bug with a fresh start."
skyrim,ffedteu,t1_ffb9meu,1579844333.0,"I really wish I did. I found nothing, but I can confirm the ""patch"" mods that exist for that don't do the job. 

I know this is the worst answer I could give, but in the process of trying to fix things I accidentally deleted the mod and just settled for not reinstalling it. 

Just out of curiosity, have you tried deleting it and reinstalling it? I could try that to see if it works, but I want to know if it's been done before just in case I screw things up for no reason."
h3h3productions,ff88oyy,t1_ff6c460,1579669248.0,"I seriously can't wrap my head around comments like these. If you're so uninterested, why are you on the subreddit? And do you frequent the subreddit of every topic you aren't a fan of just to declare it so? Cuz that sounds like a ton of work."
h3h3productions,ff88kc7,t1_ff7wzd2,1579669135.0,That's such a creative insult.
h3h3productions,ff88ies,t1_ff7nepy,1579669087.0,"They do a lot, but only though the podcast and to some extent, Twitter."

MinecraftMemes,ff573in,t1_ff3ilj0,1579582130.0,Okay so... why was he against it?
skyrim,ff51bhn,t3_e38pqv,1579577555.0,I'm experiencing this exact thing. I'm looking for fixes right now
Overwatch,ff3drg6,t3_eredvc,1579539057.0,"Sometimes I feel that way.  For example in my experience, 9.5/10 times, engaging in group fights instead of trickling in always results in a way higher chance of success, yet most of my matches always have lvl 100+ players that seen to instinctively wanna solo dive the enemy team despite the fact that nearly never seems to work."
MinecraftMemes,ff3d0je,t3_ereqep,1579538685.0,Is there any good reason not to add them? I know the Minecraft devs are super against it but I can't understand why.
todayilearned,ff3cmxq,t3_ercjcc,1579538493.0,"If any of y'all find this strange, imagine how I felt when I misread startup as syrup."
savedyouaclick,feo2oab,t1_fen5qln,1579294265.0,This is really interesting. I wish we had a popular English equivalent or at least one I knew. It would be so much easier for branding purposes.
Overwatch,fe9z64l,t1_fe7dsfb,1578942731.0,"Honestly I thought that was fine. The best way to change that in my opinion would be to give her the amount of wait time she has now. That way, she could only get a huge rez if nobody is paying attention to her. 

But I agree the instant five person rez was pretty cheap feeling."
Overwatch,fe9yelg,t1_fe9e6vx,1578942581.0,"But wouldn't that be a good thing? I mean if a res is too hard to get, how would making it more rewarding be a drawback?"
Overwatch,fe6xtqf,t3_enzm10,1578907490.0,I miss the old sym and Mercy ults. The new ones feel less unique. They had really special concepts and downgraded them in exchange for more stat buffs and shields. They just feel not as impressive and I honestly am still not over that fact.
todayilearned,fdwv4xh,t1_fdwu73m,1578762620.0,"That's what I was thinking. The ""actually"" was dropped like it was supposed to be a shocking revelation that a game based on a movie exists."
Minecraftbuilds,fdpzld8,t3_emlfsx,1578647508.0,That use of endrods is wild. Never even crossed my mind  they could be used like that.
Minecraftbuilds,fdpzh33,t1_fdpz89o,1578647346.0,Nice. Just learned about it last week I'm so surprised to catch it in action so soon.
Minecraftbuilds,fdpyw8h,t3_emi73w,1578646557.0,Are you using the 5x5 method?
falloutlore,fddg6u4,t1_fddf64t,1578310845.0,"According to the wiki, Fallout 76 implies it may have some origin in an ad campaign by Nuka-Cola. They started a cap exchange program to promote Quantum before the bombs fell and given the vendors for this program were robots, it remained valid even after the war. 

I'm sure that's just a retcon to smooth a plot hole, but the same can be said for 90% of Fallout lore."

Minecraftbuilds,fcq8yej,t3_ei839d,1577881246.0,I actually started going on this sub for inspiration for my own farming tower. This is the second one I've seen in the month and a half I've been here.
todayilearned,fcq8mqg,t1_fcoi6ep,1577881044.0,"Normally I wouldn't care about that fact. But given that fact mixed with mass incarceration supported by millions in lobbying dollars, it does make you do a bit of a double take as to their motivates."
Minecraftbuilds,fcq89ih,t3_eidlu6,1577880835.0,I like the use of ore to mock roughed up concrete.

nottheonion,fchnwrk,t3_eh7y9v,1577652217.0,"To be fair, that's a really detailed shirt."
caloriecount,fc8dkxf,t3_egonjf,1577532515.0,"It sounds to me like calorie counting isn't the issue, it's clinging to your old goals. If you really are that hooked on counting calories, stick find a new calorie goal for maintaining weight and stick to that. And definitely try to get over the fear of overstepping that goal on occasion if it's causing problems with other parts of your life. 

If you really want to stop calorie counting all together you might just delete the app? That just sounds risky to me if you rely to heavily on it. You don't want to slip into an unhealthy habit because you made to big of a jump."
todayilearned,fc6k5kh,t3_egb6ru,1577482504.0,Well this is gonna be a fun stereotype to work with.
Minecraftbuilds,fc2gawh,t3_ef0l67,1577358599.0,"What is it used for? I don't think I'd like the design as a house, but with some tweaking I think it would be a great industrial factory or green house design."
