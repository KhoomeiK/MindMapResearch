Lightsaber heroes are stupid easy to use, despite what everyone on here says it takes minimal effort to stay alive the whole match.  People say heroes are what makes this game unique, but I disagree. Every single other Star Wars game ever you play as the super strong Heroes, this is the only one that lets you play the Troopers.  Star Wars Trooper combat is the actualy unique part of this game and it's ruined by Heroes with ludacris health pools and overpowered Mobility."
