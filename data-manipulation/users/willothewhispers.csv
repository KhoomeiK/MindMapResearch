Ctrl space is only active when you enable cheats. If you're going to do this then why not just ctrl click to the villiage?

Or even skip the middleman and cheat level your troops.

It works if you set artificial boundaries for yourself. If you only cheat time quicker and nothing else then all power to you. But it feels like crossing the line to me.

>The US life expectancy is actually dropping

Thats more to do with the US's shambolic system of healthcare. It allows mortally ill people to go untreated over the question of who will pay. Many other countries with private healthcare systems do not have this issue.

>This makes real political change impossible. 

Define real political change. Ive got lgbt rights, womens rights, human rights, treatment of the mentally ill, disabled & the system of fostering/adoption all improving markedly since 1970s.

These are unrelated to technological growth. They are cultural ideas which dragged policy kicking and screaming along with them.

Political change has been historically very slow indeed. It was partially limited by the speed at which information could be disseminated. It picked up pace dramatically when the industrial revolution enabled the large scale printing of flyers to spread through a population. It triggered the overthrow of nearly all the european monarchies. It took decades because, as you say, it directly competed with corporate & monarchic power. But time inexorably moved policy in line with culture

Now the speed at which information can be disseminated is as fast as light, we haven't yet begun to see the political change this will engender as the evolution of cultural ideas accelerates.

I am defining quality of life by the raise in life expectancy, the decline in infant mortality and the access to food by those who were without among other measures. I regard not experiencing the death of your children as a serious quality of life improvement quite seperate from its connected dollar value. 

Our population is so large we are making life very difficult for people as yet unborn. Cant argue that point. The people arent worse, there are just too many.

Mistakes will help us grow with or without surveillance. Who said punishments were getting harsher? Length of prison sentences has gone down since the 70s, at least where i live.

worldnews,fd424u9,t1_fd3qbve,1578163657.0,"That's pessimistic in the extreme. In terms of quality of life, things have improved drastically for the majority of humanity over the last 50 years. Yes the zeitgeist is moving to one of perpetual performing which invites a sort of political dance, concerning what people really think, into everyday discourse. However that's always been there. This is just the latest expression of it.

Value in life was only ever a story we told ourselves. In my view highlighting this story for the made up performance that it is, only encourages us to tell better stories.

As for the surveillance, its true personal freedom and anonymity is becoming lost. A secret is a rare thing these days. And it is because of this we can now look at our leaders with a transparency we never could before. We dont yet have the tools to take them to task. Give it time. I think it is good, when your secrets are laid out on the table, to realise that 90% of the time nobody gives a shit. Theyre too worried about their own secrets. It does suck for the 10% though. Then again tabloids and mob justice existed before the internet. 

All we have done with the internet is magnify human nature. We are burning very brightly right now. Its very likely we burn out soon. But its a better story to tell, one in which we go on, so I choose the long odds.
