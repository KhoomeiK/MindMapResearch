badwomensanatomy,fcvlyz3,t1_fcuipv3,1578004956.0,Ariana Grande does blackface. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s done intentionally like the Kardashians though.
badwomensanatomy,fcvleyh,t1_fcuilkm,1578004610.0,Excuse me?? The problem isnâ€™t that sheâ€™s cosplaying a black fictional character. The fact that she changed her skin color to match the character IS blackface. Sheâ€™s trying to appear as a black cosplayer when sheâ€™s not. She can cosplay any character without changing her skin color.
badwomensanatomy,fcvkr7n,t1_fctx4tv,1578004197.0,What the fuck?? No wonder they think this is Ok. These countries are racist as hell on how they view black people (not really surprised) but still not an excuse. Are there not a black population there? Are people speaking up against this? Itâ€™s sad how weâ€™re going into 2020 and still have ignorant people like this.

badwomensanatomy,fctfw2a,t1_fctfgi8,1577941955.0,"This IS blackface. Educate yourself what blackface, she purposely made her skin darker to appear as a black woman.Not only that, the braids and full lips. Itâ€™s cute and sexy when they do it, but when itâ€™s on a black women itâ€™s deemed ugly."

insanepeoplefacebook,fchs0av,t1_fchl2ep,1577653522.0,"â€œThis country would be safer than Switzerland without minoritiesâ€ WTF, are you serious? White people commit just as much if not MORE crimes. Letâ€™s not mention how a lot white men are also rapist and pedophiles. Yet if minorities werenâ€™t here, it would somehow be â€œsaferâ€?? The fucking AUDACITY to even say something as absurd as that is mind blowing. As matter of fact, a lot of oppression minorities faced probably wouldnâ€™t exist if it wasnâ€™t for white settlers coming over to this country enslaving people, stealing land, rapes, etc. Maybe.. maybe it would be safer if white racist fucks like you left this country. 

The statistics you gave doesnâ€™t add up to the FBI crime database, try again clown. 

I never said I was done, I got time today."

insanepeoplefacebook,fchii00,t1_fcf7bph,1577650755.0,That has nothing to with how white males make a large majority of mass shootings. Your upset because white males are put in a bad light so you try to bring up the â€œ13% yet 50%â€  bullshit statistic every racist try to pull.
BPDmemes,fcga4h7,t3_egvyni,1577638005.0,Why is this so me?!
unpopularopinion,fcg3b7j,t1_fcellci,1577636119.0,"Not really, most of these stereotypes could be said about any culture.  Asian parents pressuring their kids into rigorous lectures, exams, classes, etc. doesnâ€™t equate to Asians being smart and nerdy.  In fact, I have an African friend whoâ€™s parents are like this as well. I mean you  said it yourself.. not all Indians love spice and there other cultures that do too."
unpopularopinion,fcchn58,t1_fcc2alf,1577598495.0,You forgot white men are rapist and pedophiles!
unpopularopinion,fccf1zj,t1_fccbcii,1577597655.0,"Okay, and? There also some truths to someone who doesnâ€™t fit those stereotypes and people from outside of that group who do fit that stereotype. So again, stereotypes arenâ€™t accurate at all. Just admit you  want to justify your reasoning for putting people in a box by their race/ethnicity smh."
unpopularopinion,fccaaja,t1_fcc8hta,1577596121.0,"No, a lot us DONâ€™T act like this! Thatâ€™s the problem, you think from your own personal experience or what you see online is how that group of people act. But if you took a look at all groups of people. You would find these same stereotypes in every background."
unpopularopinion,fcc7evi,t3_egt5m5,1577595234.0,"Oh look another piece of shit trying to justify their racism.Stereotypes are NOT true (rather theyâ€™re positive or not.) If you understand where a lot of these stereotypes come from and why, you will realize a lot of these things arenâ€™t true. For example, black people are seen as loud, ghetto, sassy, dumb, and ugly. That stereotype, came from when white actors would put on black face and act in that persona. Later spreading this narrative across the country thatâ€™s how we are. People like you keep believing this is what kept these stereotypes alive. Itâ€™s fucking absurd to think a certain group of people all behave and think the same way. 
Other stereotypes â€œAsians are really smartâ€ I happen to go a school where thereâ€™s a lot of diversity, and have friends who are Asian and I do way better in my classes  than most of them. 
â€œBlondes are dumbâ€ Say that to the tons of intelligent blondes??
â€œBlack people love fried chickenâ€ Iâ€™m not too crazy about it. I canâ€™t tell you how many time people have came up to tell me, â€œ Iâ€™m pretty for a black girlâ€ or â€œ You talk like a white personâ€ â€œ Wow your actually really smartâ€ Itâ€™s fucking annoying hearing this type of shit all time because people like you are actually out here believing this bullshit!"
Lolitary,fca4b89,t1_fc8d9i3,1577562866.0,"Thereâ€™s nothing â€œAsianâ€ about Megumin, she doesnâ€™t even look asian, so not sure why you brought that up. Thatâ€™s still doesnâ€™t justify that sheâ€™s clearly not over the age of 18."

unpopularopinion,fc1p2z2,t1_fc1i57x,1577325241.0,Little Mermaid isnâ€™t a European folklore.
unpopularopinion,fc12stx,t1_fc11wjb,1577306630.0,"How do you know they didnâ€™t have a open casting? According to Disney, they did."
unpopularopinion,fc121sf,t1_fc10ea9,1577306021.0,"Itâ€™s not the same thing. Black Panther was a movie about an Africa nation â€˜wakandaâ€™ it involves race and culture so it makes sense for the actress to be black. Whereas Ariel is a FISH, it has no relevance to race AT ALL so anyone can play that role. The race of Ariel doesnâ€™t matter because it adds nothing to the fucking story. Itâ€™s really not a difficult concept to get..."
unpopularopinion,fc11a8t,t1_fc0yjod,1577305394.0,"I donâ€™t think Disney sway anything or cause public outrage. The actor whoâ€™s playing Ariel shared with her fans she was doing a live action Ariel movie with Disney. Someone didnâ€™t like the idea and went on a twitter claiming how they didnâ€™t like the idea of a black ariel and it went viral from there. I donâ€™t think Disney was even promoting it yet. 

I donâ€™t see the problem with Disney remaking old films and I donâ€™t see it as â€œforcingâ€ diversity, but I do agree it would be a lot better if they just created new movies with more diversity."
unpopularopinion,fc0vp76,t1_fc0vciq,1577300897.0,What companies â€œbragâ€ about their minority/ female percentages?
unpopularopinion,fc0uy1f,t1_fc0t3u9,1577300297.0,"My thing is, if itâ€™s not base on a real person, or race related it shouldnâ€™t matter who plays the  apart in the storyline because the race aspect has no relevance to the storyline. Spider man race had nothing to do with the storyline so I wouldnâ€™t have problem if they chose a actress whoâ€™s talented but just so happened not for the usual appearance of him. Besides, so many fans of spider man who arenâ€™t x race are going to be excited to see there favorite character who looks like them. And I personally think saying  â€œoh you donâ€™t fit this original characters race?  nope you canâ€™t play this roleâ€ goes against the whole purpose of diversity. The actress talent and skills should be top priority."
unpopularopinion,fc0t7pi,t1_fc0s8mk,1577299099.0,"Right? Damn if you, damn if you donâ€™t. I think they donâ€™t want to see people of color represented in the media for whatever reason."
unpopularopinion,fc0s4p2,t1_fc0r4nz,1577298340.0,"But her race had nothing to do with the storyline, so it shouldnâ€™t  matter what race she was played by. Again, sheâ€™s a fucking fish for god sake, so her race is irrelevant. I donâ€™t think Disney pondered on her race because sheâ€™s a FISH, they chose her because sheâ€™s talented and fit the role best. They arenâ€™t forcing shit, thatâ€™s what you would like to think since sheâ€™s a black woman."
unpopularopinion,fc0r04l,t1_fc0be7e,1577297520.0,Why are you making the assumption that a less qualified person of color is more likely to get hired over a more experienced white guy when itâ€™s really the other way around 90% of the time?? Itâ€™s definitely not discrimination.
unpopularopinion,fc0ov36,t1_fc0h426,1577296123.0,"Had this been played by a white woman it wouldnâ€™t be forcing shit, but since they chose a black women to play Ariel it must be â€œforcingâ€ diversity. Had it ever cross your mind maybe they chose her because sheâ€™s talented and best fit for this character? No, you would rather think this black women is only there to â€œforceâ€ diversity. SMH. Ariel is a fish anyway, so her race shouldnâ€™t even be discussed."
unpopularopinion,fc0ngpk,t1_fc00dcb,1577295227.0,What the fuck do you mean? Diversity and hatred  has always been here. This isnâ€™t a diversity problem.
unpopularopinion,fc0mllc,t1_fbzzoyd,1577294627.0,"Itâ€™s confusing when people claim diversity is being â€œforcedâ€ whatâ€™s being forced exactly?? It isnâ€™t force when thereâ€™s a white straight person. SMH just admit seeing people of different ethnicities, and sexualities makes you uncomfortable because thatâ€™s not what your used to, and donâ€™t want to see."
creepyPMs,fbzquke,t3_eeayxo,1577256928.0,"This reminds me of that true crime story â€˜cannibal cafeâ€™ where this guy voluntary let someone cut his dick off on camera, cooked it and fed it to him."
