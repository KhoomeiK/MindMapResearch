australia,ffq4ca0,t1_ffol7t0,1580119747.0,"I had kinda the opposite argument a couple of weeks ago with an American, this girl was trying to tell me that we are part of the UK so technically we are Europeans. She was dead serious."

gaming,ffjw0mp,t3_ety8ap,1580008482.0,"No hate but I never understood the love for this game. Theres like 5 swords in the whole game and a giant empty world... I think I need direction in games though, these proper open world do anything you want games I end up wandering around and get nothing done and so it's kinda my fault that I ruin the experience for myself. But I still think its light on content for such a beloved game."

assholedesign,ffbtxal,t1_ffbduf8,1579782609.0,"Almost, but bot quite. I always do the way OP is talking about, its quicker and easier and generally most apps only have 1 category so it works fine."
NoMansSkyTheGame,ffbjmwg,t1_ffbgahr,1579768425.0,You bought an entire copy of the game to just let it sit and not be played? You're a fucken clown.
NoStupidQuestions,ff8nwss,t3_es4khz,1579688063.0,"I'm like this in life in general, I'm thinking maybe I have memory issues. When I look back at my life I dont feel like my past has shaped me. Because I dont remember most of my past. And I'm only just realising that isnt normal apparently.."
interestingasfuck,ff8nutf,t3_es42r2,1579687980.0,"Great for karma but the fires started in like August and Australia is abiut the size of the US, Canada or all of Europe. This could be anywhere and from anything up to 6 months ago in one small area. It doesnt mean much."
simpleliving,ff2wap6,t3_er2ez3,1579526582.0,"I deactivated facebook, but kept messenger, about 6 years ago and have never once regretted it. But I always tell people who are contemplating it to just strip down their profile and friends list etc and still use it for events and groups and memes and keeping in touch with friends. It's hard for a lot of people to give up such a huge part of their social life.

I haven't posted on instagram in something like 3 years and never had a Twitter.

In regard to changes; I just fill the void with other things tbh. I'm on the reddit app for hours every day for example... facebook wasnt making me depressed because I was comparing myself to others, it was more that I just didnt care about their lives and it was just something mindless to scroll through.

So it hasnt been a net positive in my life, but that's entirely on me and my addictive personality I guess."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff2stx4,t1_ff2ghv9,1579522669.0,Honestly it's pretty messed up how ingrained it is that you have to have alcohol to have a good time. It's one of those 'givens' in most society and if you dont want to participate YOURE the weird one..
starterpacks,ff2rawe,t3_er8i1d,1579520593.0,I dont get like 90% of posts here. I used to be so freaking confused before I realised they're usually referencing something v specific haha..

clevercomebacks,fewxtmu,t3_eqr4x5,1579421149.0,Unrelated but I had a bit of an argument with two Americans the other night who maintained that Australia was in Europe because its part of the UK and that I don't even know where I was born. And they weren't kidding...
simpleliving,fevzaa6,t1_fesewec,1579403358.0,"Hey thanks I appreciate this comment, cooking is the other thing I've been thinking of getting into more. Especially because im from the West but live in Thailand so it would be amazing to learn all these new things and try out new techniques and spices and things I'm not used to.

Same too, ideally I'd love a little permaculture garden and be as close to zero waste as I can!"
simpleliving,fevyt2g,t1_feqx4mm,1579403244.0,"Pure luck with bitcoin. Knew nothing about it, a mate was raving about it in 2009ish so I bought some and forgot about it for 10yrs...

But I've always been a simple man and never cared about money and wanted a simple life. So instead of buying a private jet and some houses and ferraris, I decided it was the perfect opportunity to enable me the simple life I want that will last me 60yrs without having to work.

I dont usually talk about it so it's nice to be able to, to strangers!"
simpleliving,fevy2vo,t1_fevihsp,1579402993.0,"Hey thanks I appreciate that. The usual reaction is more along the lines of 'f*** you I'm so jealous!'. Which I totally understand, but still isnt nice to hear all the time haha."
ChoosingBeggars,fesjx8d,t3_eqc0ad,1579365990.0,"I will never understand why 99.9% of posts here the OP is so polite and accommodating. Why do you waste your time with these people, I would've been out after about their second message."
simpleliving,feqvcjn,t3_eqeciw,1579346464.0,"A nice normal day is sit in the sun on the deck with a coffee and a book and the dog in my lap. Sometimes for 10min sometimes for 3hrs. Then go back inside and put some music on and sit to do some writing. Research possible holiday destinations and go spend too much time on youtube watching peoples vlogs from those places. Go out for a walk for lunch stretch my legs. Usually take a book with me and take my time, sit and relax with a drink even after ive finished eating. 

In the afternoon I usually watch a movie (today was Coco) and pretty much every night I eat and have a beer with friends.

Once a fortnight or month I usually go away just for a night or two, usually to places within a couple hours drive. Explore villages and waterfalls and hikes I havent been to before etc. 

I'm thinking of starting painting or something, I like being creative and I do a lot of nothing to be honest. As in I have a lot of dead time where I sit around on my laptop and i watch too much Netflix just to fill time etc. 

I retired at 30 and as much as I preached about staying busy and keeping active and defending myself from the classic ""oh you'll get bored I couldn't possibly do nothing"", I'm already finding myself drinking too much and sitting around too much.."

But in some countries it's a condition of buying the ticket that they can then use your face and name everywhere to try sell more tickets next time."
