classicwow,fgl6135,t3_ez2b64,1580883209.0,I came to this conclusions when AV was released. I played 5 games and lost all them. No thank you.
classicwow,fgl49vj,t1_fgl3tks,1580881541.0,"Imagine playing a faction so dominate, max level world pvp is indistinguishable from ganking lowbies in STV."
classicwow,fgl15ts,t1_fgjnm8k,1580878842.0,"I don’t play this game for the Pvp. It took about 2 days of the honor system to see the silliness of it. So no, I am not butthurt. I simply don’t have enough fucks to give. However, if I did care, and if the shoe was on the other foot. I would have rolled horde immediately, because I don’t have any interest in uneven game play. I am genuinely offended by people like you. You don’t care about making the game better. All you care about is getting what you want at the expense of everyone else. If rank 14 gear required you to steal candy from a baby, you would. And it is pretty much is that. So you essentially steal candy from babies. It’s a poor choice of words because a low hanging fruit grabber like yourself is 100% guarantied to agree with me about alliance being “babies”.

Cheers my misguided friend. And to quote Lee Ann Womack: “Never settle for the path of least resistance [...] I hope you dance”. Someday, you will actually dance."
AskReddit,fgjg0cp,t1_fgias2a,1580843259.0,"Same here. I get it. Apple has that pretentious vibe that people hate, but they make quality products. I have had the same Iphone 6 for the last 7 years or so."
AskReddit,fgjeb95,t3_eynu3k,1580842246.0,"Concerts

Yeah, let’s cram ourselves into a confined area with smelly, sweaty people. Let’s upcharge the alcohol to absurdity, oh and btw, the music is never better than the actual studio original. Oh and don’t forget the tickets are marked up 300-400% because fuck you we know you will pay.

I am just amazed people attend concerts. If Freddie Mercury was resurrected from the dead, you would have to pay me to attend that concert, and I love fucking queen."
classicwow,fgikp2n,t1_fgikiky,1580824432.0,I am good. I got all I could ever want and more.
classicwow,fgikg1a,t1_fgik6gc,1580824237.0,"I don’t think it matters. At this point, it probably gives you strength when people point it out."
classicwow,fgijykb,t1_fgie1i2,1580823850.0,"I know what you look like without even having to see you, lol."
classicwow,fgiio96,t1_fgihxxf,1580822803.0,"Because it is your fault. You knew you were coming to the dominate side. You knew Blizzard was not going to do anything about it. You picked easy mode along with the vast majority of your easy mode buddies. This entire situation is a negative feedback loop that Horde created. It was always the communities responsibility to try and balance factions. Players like you should have faction changed months ago. You saw the writing on the wall, but you don’t care. You’d probably sell your mother into slavery if it meant you could get rank 14 a month earlier."
suspiciouslyspecific,fghl5nw,t1_fghgl15,1580787309.0,"Yeah, that’s me. There’s like a 10 second where my wife works it like I am cumming and then I need her to stop immediately. It’s really sensitive for me."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fghkjbu,t1_fgh9enk,1580786898.0,And you’d regret immensely.

classicwow,fgc27yg,t3_exkpv9,1580668305.0,I am so happy Horde pvp edgelords are miserable. You guys knew you had the numbers and the better quality of players going into the game. Now you can enjoy what you created. Your tears are delicious.
classicwow,fgbz707,t3_exmy4t,1580667492.0,Good. They knew exactly what they were doing and chose to do it anyway. Now they can pay to do nothing.

hearthstone,fgbcelq,t3_exk4mj,1580660596.0,I hope not. It was pretty awful the first time. It was nothing but ultra fast aggro decks
hearthstone,fgb9mh4,t1_fg8flcp,1580659858.0,"You will 100% have a completed collection, assuming collection means all the cards of an expansion. 1 pre-order and 15-17k of dust or gold will get you all/almost all the cards in an expansion release. I have been doing this for the last 2 years. The problem for most people is 1. You may miss quest and 2. You are probably still working on the previous expansions cards.

Incoming downvotes, but I am correct."
