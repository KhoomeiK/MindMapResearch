CasualConversation,ffx3bry,t1_ffx27m7,1580316858.0,"Ok. Get a PO box. Use that on resumes. Make sure you ALWAYS have a cell phone. Answer every call that comes in. Apply for every job you can. 

Go find your nearest vocational rehabilitation office. They are the ones who saved my ass. They have NUMEROUS resources! Job coaches, money for job interview clothes, money for clothes for jobs, money for transportation. 

Get on food stamps. If you have a disability (physical or mental) start the process of applying for disability, it can take an extremely long time. And I can't emphasize this enough. Get a lawyer from the beginning. It's a full time job applying for it and being disabled.

Feel free to message me. I've been there. It sucks. I'm more than happy to help answer specific  questions for you!"

relationships,ffwhimt,t3_evh4v3,1580301203.0,"Agreed with everyone else. Ask the manager about the gift (I know everyone else said the same thing.) 

Contacting higher ups than manager is also a good idea, maybe on their Facebook page?"
CasualConversation,ffwh65g,t3_evgeho,1580300863.0,"I was homeless in the states for 18 months. I was in homeless shelters though. I LOVED when I could sleep on a couch and get a shower that was longer than five minutes, it meant I could shave my legs! 

My place is small and simple, but I will always be thankful. I've learned to appreciate the little things. 

I got on disability and now have money to pay for my basic needs. Rent comes first and then everything else. Money will always be tight, but I budget down to the dollar and always make it work somehow. 

I HATED being homeless. At the time I was suicidal every day. I spent two weeks in the psych unit. Looking back, I'm not... Thankful for it. I am thankful for how much I learned and for all the people that I've been able to pass on the little known secrets that can help people that want help."
CasualConversation,ffwgqa0,t1_ffvn9l1,1580300414.0,Don't give up!!! Can I ask what country you're in? I was homeless in the US for 18 months and can offer numerous resources that might be able to help you.
exmormon,ffwgipr,t1_ffw8ngt,1580300200.0,Right. Because the church and BYU would NEVER cover up bad things... Oh wait......

Don't forget the funeral potatoes and ham."
Flamepoints,ffjzdrz,t1_ffjy5kc,1580011155.0,Haha nope! I can see why you'd think that though!
relationships,ffjxxan,t3_etxdq1,1580009998.0,"I'd highly suggest contacting vocational rehabilitation. They can help in ways you can't even imagine. They are a government program and are used to help differently abled people. I was so thankful to them when they helped me. They aren't perfect, but they really do the best they can with what they have."

exmormon,ffi7cnj,t3_etqo5g,1579967004.0,Which temple is this? Maybe you can meet up with a Reddit exmo? (Maybe it's too scary but nothing bad will happen on temple grounds right!?!?)
exmormon,ffi7491,t3_etcjxc,1579966835.0,"I think most of them are pretty from a distance. I don't like what they stand for, being inside them, or how *I* feel on temple grounds though. 

The light pollution is crazy. I live less than two blocks from the salt lake temple and have black out curtains on my windows because they face the temple."
exmormon,ffewdf5,t3_et32o3,1579868278.0,"I had a surgeon and his team pray OVER me, holding hands before surgery in preop. I was very sick but I remember thinking ""what the actual fuck!?!?"" I wasn't dying or anything, the surgery wasn't being done to save my life.... But jeebus."
exmormon,ffevycp,t1_ffelt6y,1579867822.0,"""no specific thing is everybody's guide to truth.""

This is exactly how I feel. Everyone has their own path. Some get the lightening strike. Some go gently. Some get a bit of both. 

I think throwing everyone into a thunderstorm holding a lightening rod is a terrific way to keep some people from the truth about the LDS church."

cats,ff0rhrt,t1_ff0qchm,1579471627.0,Eh I'm a chick. No worries here
cats,ff08bsq,t1_ff044vh,1579466224.0,Why shower alone when you can shower with a cat? What fun would that be? I worry mine is up to no good if mine doesn't at least make a guest appearance in my shower
iamatotalpieceofshit,fen2n9s,t3_epqwu4,1579275609.0,"I am on an insulin pump, am on disability, social security and am on medicare. I use Novolog and go through two vials a month. I pay 29% of the cost from my pharmacy. Their cost? Almost $1300. I grabbed samples of Novolog from my doctor. I have no idea how I will pay for my insulin. My deductible for prescriptions? Nearly $7000. Over half of what I get on disability. 

Guess I won't be eating, taking other meds for my other chronic conditions, having a place to sleep... Well. You get the idea. 

Rationing insulin scares the shit out of me. But what the fuck else can I do?"
iamatotalpieceofshit,fen2287,t1_femhl95,1579275234.0,You don't. Many ration insulin and consequently die.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fen1vu4,t1_felnpgi,1579275121.0,Yeah that insulin doesn't work for a lot of people unfortunately :( I WISH I could use it though.

I guess I was simply so thankful you have that unconditional love of those animals who were so glad to see you. That's the best way I can think to put it"
MasterReturns,fegdkv3,t3_eox6fn,1579088920.0,"I'll be honest, this made me cry. Their love for you is very obvious, as is the fact that they missed you. I'm so glad you have them to bring comfort to you. 

Please accept my virtual hugs."
curledfeetsies,fe2kpmf,t1_fe2jerw,1578839599.0,"They are like womens fake nails, they just grow off and can be easily removed. 

I go to the vet to have it done because I enjoy having all my fingers and eye balls and they trim her claws down, put the non toxic adhesive glue in the cap and stick it on her claw. She gets treats and is fine. She kind of nibbles on them for a day then just forgets. These ones have lasted about 8 weeks so far. 

The first ones she pulled off pretty quickly which sucked because she was a JERK about clawing me (she came to me from an abusive home) but is now totally used to them and doesn't try to gnaw them off like she used to!

You can find the brand name ones (soft paws) at your local pet store or on Amazon. But I bought an off brand that has a variety of colors for MUCH more inexpensive. The adhesive isn't as good as the brand name but still works!"
