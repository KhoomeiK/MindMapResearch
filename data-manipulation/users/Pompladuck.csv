GriefSupport,ff273e5,t1_ff257ie,1579495688.0,"I'm sorry for your loss as well. Losing a parent is more difficult than I could have ever imagined. And that's exactly it I think. We had things to do afterwards so the grief was pushed back for a bit while we made arrangements.

Thank you for your kind words."

GriefSupport,fewafac,t3_eqqnvn,1579407536.0,"I'm sorry for your loss. A beautiful song that really touches me is Two Mirrors by Tim Baker. It hits close to home and feels really powerful.

Keep in mind that's it's also okay not to cry. Everyone experiences grief differently. Feel what you feel and how you feel is okay."
canada,ferjel8,t1_feq5ib1,1579354651.0,"Isn't it a little arrogant that you think the US is mentioned in literally anything a Canadian says? 

Canada absolutely has its own problems that it's people want addressed. Though I'm personally content (not ecstatic) that the Liberal party won in the last election, their promise of electoral reform hasn't been met. Canadians want a fair voting system where we can be proportionally represented. We also currently have an Ontario Premier who wants to gut the education system and substitute teachers for online e-learning classes, without any regard for how that would negatively impact students. 

The US are our neighbors and it's normal to discuss neighboring or other countries when taking about our own. That's how a discussion evolves - through comparing and contrasting. Stop taking every poke against the US as an insult. Maybe you'll lose this toxic attitude and can effectively participate in conversations. Be better."
