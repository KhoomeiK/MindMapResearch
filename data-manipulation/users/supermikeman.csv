GameDeals,ffcswbu,t1_ffcl61c,1579806588.0,But at least the witcher cutscenes were skipable. Plus you could do dialogue choices so that helped. Plus the cutscenes never lasted too long.

GameDeals,ffc6q4l,t1_ffc6cnv,1579792816.0,Because I bought a game. Not a movie. Same issue I had with Tales from the Borderlands. I forgot that one was a game so when the QTEs came up I died a few times.
GameDeals,ffc4xv7,t1_ffc3jc9,1579791623.0,"It kind of bugs me how ""Story Heavy"" seems to mean mostly cutscenes. Aren't there ""Story Heavy"" games that incorporate the story into the gameplay better? Personally I felt the Witcher 3 and even some fallout games did that well. 
I don't think Yakuza is ""Story Heavy"" but really just cutscene heavy. They rely so much on cutscenes that it becomes less of a game and more of a movie."
GameDeals,ffc356v,t3_essbrp,1579790371.0,How much of this game is just cutscenes? I remember trying to play it but got really turned off at the amount of both animated and visual novel type cutscenes in the first couple hours.

Tried doing the one where you kill off the guards but couldn't get all of them. Rockstar really doesn't want you to make any money in that game unless they sold it to you directly."

Lovecraft,fdo59nn,t1_fdo317r,1578599131.0,"There were a few connections here or there with different tales. But I don't think Lovecraft took them too seriously, or at least they weren't always cannon perse."
Lovecraft,fdnz4tn,t1_fdnyfsi,1578595795.0,"Thanks. I'll read those soon. I think maybe Lovecraft's horros feel a little dated to me because we've understood more and more of the cosmos. The idea of species living for eons or existing millions of years before and after man, plus the billions of years the universe has existed, kind of makes his stories feel a little less scary. 

I really like the idea of the human mind being severely limited when it comes to understanding the universe. If it's not just our minds but also our tools that are limited that opens the way to horrifying new discoveries."
Lovecraft,fdnyob3,t1_fdnuhnv,1578595529.0,"I think maybe a good idea is to think of the entities as either forces of nature or animals. They don't think rationally or with the same logic as a human. But they might have patterns of behavior that we can recognize but not do anything about. Like Nyarlothotep ""serving Azathoth"" meaning that by creating chaos in the universe he can keep the link to the Azathoth shut. The pipers around the center of the universe might be the galaxy clusters that orbit the center of the universe. If entropy occurs then our universe is noticed by Azathoth and re-absorbed into it. At least for me as a writer gives me a motivation for Nyarlothotep I can used to dictate what it does in whatever story I'm writing. The protagonist doesn't have to know any of that but just react or try to live through whatever chaotic mess Nyarlothotep is making today."
Lovecraft,fdnqle0,t1_fdnpa5w,1578590947.0,"I don't know if I like the whole unknowable angle. I can see how unexplained would work but I like the idea of it being something like a black hole or a volcano. You can know as much about it as you want, but the more you know the worse it'll be. I kind of like the idea of the protagonists sense of their own power and significance being drained over the course of their study. To the point where they're in utter despair. 
Like you're hiking on a mountain, and it begins to erupt. It's slow so you have time to come to the realization of what's happening. But your knowledge won't save you. I guess I want Lovecraftian brand cosmic horror to rely on the sense of scale and absolute powerlessness of its protagonists more than them facing unknowable entities."
Lovecraft,fdnofct,t1_fdnm2os,1578589927.0,True. I think something that's gone wrong with Lovecraft is how so much art takes what Lovecraft said a bit too literally. Like how tentacles on Cthulhu's maw have suction cups. I feel it grounds something that's supposed to be super alien to our idea of animals too much. I will say though that the illustrations from Loic Muzy did a great job of making them look like something I could see in real life.
Lovecraft,fdnnqig,t1_fdnm9gl,1578589590.0,"I get that, but I think the problem I have with Lovecraft's work was how vague he was at explaining what the character was seeing. It mostly was stuff like ""It was so horrible I can't even describe it."" Gotta be honest Howie, that doesn't really make me scared or disturbed. However if you describe a monster as having no defnite shape, but as it bubbled and twisted I could see bastardizations of eyes and limbs as  it groped it's way along, consuming and integrating any and all flesh in it's way. Yeah...that'd do the trick. Naturally I can't understand what it is, but hell if I'm not going to be freaked out. 

Also I think I wasn't too clear. As the person running the game I want to have a bit of background on the entities I use. While the players/characters don't or can't know the true nature of what the entity is, me know helps me figure out why the unnatural events are taking place. I guess if I understand the motivations or nature of the thing at least a little, then I can have a better picture of how it'll act."

Aquariums,fdkyk89,t1_fdkxmd7,1578513811.0,I have an aquaclear 20 running on the tank. Are you referring to a canister filter maybe?
Aquariums,fdkxbtq,t1_fdkwbwf,1578513086.0,It would work if my filter would suck up enough of it. I had a prefilter sponge on the intake so I think a lot of gunk and plant material built up.
Aquariums,fdkw8xv,t1_fdktdbw,1578512453.0,Sorry but I don't think  you specified. You're talking about worms right?
scientology,fdjzcru,t1_fdj1hfr,1578492105.0,You mean lucid dreaming? I've experienced that occasionally. Really weird experience but fun nonetheless. Any and all sensation I've had in there is usually related to sensations I've experience in my waking life. Like grass under my feet or textures on doorknobs or floors.
Aquariums,fdjz84n,t1_fdiu5nx,1578492005.0,Are you talking about getting rid of detritus as in debris or detritus worms?
Aquascape,fdhy2ll,t1_fdhs9qo,1578432246.0,It comes back here and there. If I keep on top of it or it grows in a place where it's not as noticeable I'm okay.
Aquascape,fdhr4qx,t1_fdhnudq,1578428539.0,Yeah. I've had green hair mix in with some moss and you can't remove it without removing the moss too. I mean I'm glad my aquarium can grow stuff but maybe it's a little too good.
scientology,fdhn9bj,t3_el6atk,1578426244.0,I've had the feeling of being distant from my body when I was high on weed once. Not sure if that's quite the same experience but it might be the same effect on the brain.
Aquascape,fdhn58b,t3_elf43j,1578426176.0,Maybe weeping or phoenix mosses? Or some Anubias along the back so the leaves peak over the top.
PlantedTank,fdhll9z,t3_el8c69,1578425239.0,The rocks look hard enough to count as hardscape so step one complete.

Aquariums,fdhe4h7,t1_fdhax8a,1578420734.0,Also the guppies I got at an auction and the endlers from a local fish store. Like I said in previous comments I didn't know the age of either set of fish so it's possible they were just older.
Aquariums,fdhbanq,t1_fdhax8a,1578419301.0,"The 7.6 was from the regular PH test from the API freshwater Master kit. That's the highest reading for that test and I took to mean the PH is at least 7.6. I then did the high ph test which goes from 7.8 to I think 8.8 or 9.0. Unless PH can suddenly jump within 5 minutes with no addition of water or change in the aquarium I didn't have a jump but just had different result with different tests. Here's a quote from the ph test kit instructions: *""The minimum pH reading for this kit is 6.0 and the maximum is 7.6. Under extreme water conditions, readings below the minimum will read 6.0 and above the maximum will read 7.6. pH adjustments outside the range of this kit will not show any changes until the pH of the aquarium water is within the range of this kit. When keeping livebearers, goldfish, African Cichlids or marine fish and invertebrates use the API HIGH RANGE pH TEST KIT.""*"
scientology,fdhaswn,t3_eleefc,1578419042.0,I mean....Nation of Islam so....yeah. 'Nuff said.
Aquariums,fdhaouh,t1_fdh9l7h,1578418981.0,I don't think there was any change. Or at least nothing harsh or sudden.
Aquariums,fdh9goe,t1_fdh0lbh,1578418263.0,True. The only one I know the age of is the juvenile that was born a month or so back. So it could be age. I guess that's why people try to get a breeding colony going so they have plenty of replacements. I'll do some research into ember tetras. I did have those before and liked them.
Aquariums,fdh9a2x,t1_fdgz2kw,1578418153.0,I did check both regular and high ph tests. The regular test had the result of 7.6 which is the max so I used the high ph as well.
Aquariums,fdh96rt,t1_fdgwxm6,1578418098.0,Not yet. I have a kit but haven't used it in a while. Those things are annoying to check with the drop counting and whatnot.
scientology,fdec7n3,t1_fd61duh,1578335843.0,Seriously though. If you've ever been to downtown Clearwater you know that's true. The only real foot traffic you have down there are Scientologists (staff and general public) or the homeless. It may pick up when there's a Concert in Coachman Park but otherwise that's it.
scientology,fd61duh,t3_ek42f4,1578184185.0,If they mean walked in then right out then maybe. Or homeless people looking for a bathroom to use.
Aquariums,fcc8jjy,t3_egvs5i,1577595588.0,That's really cool. Hope you get some nice driftwood soon.
scientology,fbho9dq,t1_fbhih1y,1576878408.0,That's fair. I won't fault anyone with finding something positive in Scientology. I guess my only suggestion is keep your eye out for sketchy behavior or policies and always remember you can leave if you want to. I've known some perfectly pleasant and good people who were Scientologists.
