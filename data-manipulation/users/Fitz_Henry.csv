AskReddit,fgk6gs8,t1_fgjz356,1580858502.0,"Well, my sister's cat *definitely* has her favorite movies. She stares at the TV for an extended period of time whenever they're on and almost only for these. Movies like Monsters University (I'd say this is the fav), Monsters Inc, Bolt, etc. 

To get/hold her attention, they've gotta be colorful overall and have brightly colored creatures/animals that are the focus of the film, the animals/creatures must be animated (She doesn't care to watch real animals), and interesting sounds/noises that are also loud--like the scare roars in Monsters University."

AmItheAsshole,fgj0oi9,t1_fgh81dt,1580834748.0,"Yes! That sound is nails on a chalkboard for me. I would have moved seats if possible if he didn't accept the tissues. OP told him this stranger the truth in their reason for the offer and wasn't rude/mean. It would've been a lot easier to refuse the tissues if OP'd said something like, ""being sick is terrible"" as sooo many people here have suggested. So NTA from me as well."

KDRAMA,fgb68ik,t3_exhruz,1580658864.0,"I feel the same way! I got my sisters into KDramas just so I could share them with somebody (they're hooked now) but we don't really discuss, only make recommendations to each other. Honestly, it'd be great to have a friend to talk about Kdramas with. I suppose an online KDrama friend would be better than none, so count me in! I also only really got into them August of last year so still pretty new but I have watched a lot in that time. (2yrs younger than you, OP, btw)"

fatcats,ffr8t8i,t3_eus667,1580152951.0,"Was the belly shaved for a recent procedure? Or has she been licking it off? Only asking because my sister's slightly overweight cat had been licking all the fur off of her belly in that same area/size and it took us a while to figure out it was the food (could have upset her stomach, no clue since her poo was fine). So anyway, we switched her food and her fur grew back."
