In the city you don't just go around shooting animals, and these geese are known knobheads, so there *could* be some glee in getting some revenge."

My ""conspiracy theory"": Markets don't respond positively to conservative party financial actions because of any soundness in said actions.  Markets respond positively to conservative party financial actions because the people in control of corporations refuse to engage in fiscally positive actions unless they get what they want politically, which, essentially, is more money.

In other words, it's not the economy, it's the people.

science,fgmatly,t1_fgm8bhb,1580921098.0,"Clearly no one involved in this study has ever worked for a corporation with blue collar workers.  If they did, they must not have fraternized with any of them them.

Not to mention they've done a shit job of having not only their results peer-reviewed, but their entire planned study from the get-go.  Whoever gave this a green light's just as clueless.

Stuff like this just kills me because it's a perfect example of how out of touch some academics are with reality, which just gives anti-science people one more piece of ammunition to discredit good science."

todayilearned,feetduo,t1_feawmz4,1579040802.0,"Try pushing a flow of fluid through an already wet, densely packed sponge.

Not likely.

More likely will be that you will have an IV that goes through a machine that oxygenates your blood for you.  You then don a mask and fill your lungs and mask with this fluid (simply to keep them from collapsing under the weight when you dive), but your lungs moving this fluid back and forth will only be muscle memory and not actually be needed to keep your blood oxygenated.

The questions will be (a) whether or not you will be able to get over your instinct to cough up/out this fluid, or (b) whether or not you'll feel like you're suffocating at all (despite having fluid in your lungs) as long as your blood is staying oxygenated."
