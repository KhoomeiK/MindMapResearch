explainlikeimfive,fey90eu,t3_eqw4b6,1579442309.0,"A lot of it depends on preference and convenience. For example, I love hot coffee and ice coffee, but making ice coffee at home is extra work, whereas ice coffee can be quickly blended by a barista, FOR A PRICE. Or hot chocolate is great, but so are the cold chocolate drinks with a straw. We love hot soup here, but people also enjoy the cold soup they serve in Europe. Hot pizza is great, and cold pizza the next day. I’ve had coke cold at first, then sit in my car for a couple hours when I’m driving all day, and I still enjoy it. Also, warmth can bring just that, warmth and comfort. Cold can bring just that, cool and collected. It’s all preference and convenience.
