rpghorrorstories,ffboboi,t1_ffb7xy9,1579775495.0,"One example I've been using for the past twenty years is Dick Cheney, former vice-president of the US. This was a guy who had an active disdain for the law in all of its forms, who was motivated entirely by greed and personal ambition, but who was smart and knew how to game the system. He almost never did anything that would directly get him in trouble, and when he did, like drunkenly shoot a friend in the face, he got that friend to *apologize to him* on national television in order to shift the blame. 

A guy like that, as morally repugnant, as obviously malign and repulsive as he was, got to where he was *because he was a good team player* and used existing systems to his advantage and benefit.

rpg,ff9162r,t1_ff8mogc,1579702242.0,"One of my favourite single RP moments ever was very similar. My friend Billy was playing a dim-witted sorcerer named Dhom, with a staggering wisdom of 5. His character was constantly making astonishingly poor judgment calls, which up to this point had been pretty harmless. 

Then one night we find ourselves in this haunted village, assailed by these vengeful undead spirits which were simply beyond our ability to fight or survive. In the middle of town, there was a large circle of stones with magical runes carved into them; all but one. The last one was incomplete, with a hammer, a chisel, and a desiccated corpse next to it. Plainly this was some sort of ritual which the caster had died in the midst of trying to complete. Pretty easy to deduce that it was intended to counteract whatever was going on in town, right? 

Billy has Dhom check it out, and gets a natural 1 on his arcana check to figure out what the spell is, or - more importantly - what the final rune was supposed to be. He's told that he has no idea by the DM. Billy looks around the room, and with genuine remorse in his voice says ""I'm sorry guys, but you know I have to do this, right?"" 

We all solemnly nod as he chisels out a magic rune chosen apparently entirely at random, causing a massive fireball to erupt, killing one of our party members and badly wounding everyone else, while at least also dispelling all of the spirits.

If so, maybe spelling out the issues that you're having with his approach here is worthwhile in a way that it wouldn't be with an adult. An adult who behaves this way has no excuse; they're a shitty DM and a shitty person.

There's this deeply-ingrained tribalism where people will stake out a position where THEIR favourite Fallout game is not only the *best* Fallout game, but that people who hold contrary positions are bad people.

Fallout New Vegas has the best storytelling in the franchise. Fallout 4 has the best gameplay. Fallout 76 has fantastic creative opportunities and the social aspect is a fucking blast. Fallout 3 has an air of desperate gloom and desolation which is better-realized than anything else in the series. They're all the best game in the series at the things they do best. 

Which specific thing you like best is entirely a matter of personal taste and is so subjective that any answer is totally valid.

It's using perceived abhorrence of homosexuality in order to needle and offend, resting on the presumption that homosexuality is *something to be offended by the suggestion of*.

The concept of the character was, though it was never really *explicitly* spelled out this way, that he was this kind of threateningly flamboyant and excessively glamorous gay weirdo. Apparently the guy who played the character received so much genuine homophobic hate, with such vitriol, that it opened his eyes to, like, just how bad actual gays have it in America. There was a PSA spot which ran during a WWF episode where the actor playing the character spoke about this, and about the importance of standing up against this sort of bigotry. 

Now don't get me wrong: I'm sure that part of this is self-serving; he wanted to be able to say to the wrestling fans ""Hey, it's just a character, I'm not actually gay!"" and the fact that he continued to play this character who sort of embodied these negative gay stereotypes doesn't help either. But it is interesting that this is the only case I can think of, as a wrestling fan at the time, where they were like ""Haha, guys, it's just an act and none of it is real!"" on-air. Normally they don't break character that way."

I normally take the 133 from home to Edmonds skytrain station, but the moment I stepped out of my apartment building I realized it would be faster to walk to the train station than to wait for a bus. Half-way to the station I saw this specific scene with six busses all immobilized at a single intersection and patted myself on the back for my insight and not having waited for one of them."

rpghorrorstories,fdqogvd,t3_emr1sx,1578671431.0,"I once heard a story about a DM who had an extremely cunning approach to players like this which I've never had to employ, but which would be absolutely *magical* in terms of dealing with someone like Chris. 

He would get his hands on materials for a published adventure module, which he would keep on-hand at the gaming table. He would make a show of consulting it regularly. And he would run a 100% homebrewed adventure with no connection whatsoever to the contents of these books. If any of his players felt like spending the money to acquire these books, they would find it money poorly-spent when the time came to try their hand at what Chris was doing."

At that point, I know what I would have done: I'd have reskinned and renamed *every single enemy they faced* from now on. 

They would never, ever see a shambling mound. They'd fight something that has all of the same stats and challenge rating and loot and attacks as a shambling mound, but I'd have described it as a writhing, frankensteinian flesh-thing. All of its attacks would have been described in terms not found in the published books. Not once would Chris have ever been able to identify any of these foes as monsters he could look up anywhere. 

I've had a DM do this before, to great effect. He had our party attacked by a group of acrobatic assassins with garrotes. He would later tell me he just used the stats for [Chokers](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Choker_\(5e_Creature\)), and I never suspected a thing until he told me.

EDIT: Getting a lot of downvotes here, and not a lot of sense of *what* people are downvoting, as I mention in a similarly-downvoted question down-thread a bit. Now, I've done a bit of googling on the topic, hoping to find some information on the topic of his daughter in the hopes of being able to link it as corroborating evidence, and have found basically nothing; his wikipedia page mentions that he has ""four children,"" but doesn't name them, and there's only two that seem to be famous or well-known. What I've been given to understand is that my niece's mother is one of them, but I confess that this has planted the seed of doubt in my mind: It doesn't seem impossible that what I was told, twenty-some years ago, about my brother's wife's father, wasn't true. I've e-mailed my niece, who's now an adult, to ask her for some clarification on the topic, including ""Hey, when I was told this back in the 1990s, was I being fed a bullshit line that I've uncritically believed to be true ever since?"" I'll be interested to hear back from her on the topic.

EDIT 2: Still waiting on a reply from my niece, but I've had a lengthy conversation with my brother about this and asking for some details. The short version: From what he tells me, his first wife - my niece's mother - was the result of a fling that Henrickson had when he was quite young, before his acting career started and before he was in the public's eye. He was never married to her mother and has evidently never spoken of this relationship publicly. There was a brief time, early in her adulthood, that she was able to reconnect with her father and spent a few weeks living with him, during which time he was apparently eager to make amends and make up for his neglect as a father. It was when she got pregnant and let him know that he was about to be a grandfather that he went silent on her, disappearing from her life once more and this time permanently. He's never spoken to nor met his granddaughter. 

I don't know how I would go about proving any of this. Obviously the information I'm getting is all second-hand at best. I don't blame anyone who doesn't believe me and obviously I'm not in a position to provide anything which a skeptic would find persuasive, unless my niece gets back to me and is like ""Yeah, here's some photos of them together from that time that she stayed with them, and their family resemblance is inescapably obvious"" or something. So I think I'm going to let this one go at this point. I'll say that I understand everyone who has greeted this with skepticism, and all that I ask is that you grant me the benefit of the doubt that I've been dealing in good faith, given the information I've had available to me."

This said, I recognize that I'm basically on one edge of the bell-curve where ""preference for constant combat"" is concerned in these games, and OP and his group is on the other far edge of it. I'd have opted out of a group like this fairly soon myself just because it's obvious that we're looking for diametrically opposed things out of our leisure time, and we're both just going to inhibit the other's enjoyment."
