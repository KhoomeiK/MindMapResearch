legaladvice,fffighw,t1_fffb2e4,1579884664.0,"ahhh I understand now. I do not know the law in your state, and if you are unsure contact the proper people to find out for sure. If it is indeed true then your only recourse will be to contest the ticket in court and go in and plead your case as to how bad you need your car and why, and how extremely sorry you are for breaking the law, I do not think, if he has radar proof of your speed, that their is any way you can argue that you didn't deserve the ticket, but as I said you can go in plead your case and pretty much beg and hope you get a lenient judge. Anyhow good luck with whatever happens I am sorry to hear of the illness in your family it is I am sure a stressful time, best of luck."

nottheonion,fff9lgd,t1_fff8mbb,1579879081.0,"Same, I worked 'b hall' of the emergency room in our hospital. B hall was the section for sub acute, psychiatric cases, and where police brought the drunk and homeless. i worked b because i looked intimidating (even though i'm a teddy bear) so people generally wouldn't act up. Being in Northern ontario canada we definitely saw an uptick in people who would be brought in by police, they would sleep in the hall overnight get a sandwich, if they were really grubby have a hot shower and some food and would get removed in the morning, only to see them return that night. So it is definitely easy to see someone committing a crime just to get in jail for whatever amt of time to get out of the cold."

Methadone,ffexahz,t3_et9mvl,1579869234.0,"As well as what the above poster said, it sounds like your methadone dose is to low. My methadone dr said your starting dose should be a dose where you are not having any withdrawal symptoms and you are not craving any opiates. I started at 90 mg that was the level i stopped the cravings and over time stopped thinking about/obsessing over opiates. then when i was ready i started going down 5 mg at a time.  I am currently at 75 mg i drop whenever i feel comfortable usually monthly to every second month. you haven't failed you slipped up and are paying that penalty. You can do it mate have faith in yourself, explain to your doctor you are still craving and get on a better start dose"

Methadone,ff6kuir,t3_ery0rb,1579629354.0,"started at 90mg. Currently on 75 mg. whenever i drop, it is by 5 mg. and I give it a month between each drop, so far I have not felt any adverse effects. Just take your time, listen to your body, and mind."
Methadone,ff6khc1,t3_eruyjv,1579629130.0,"I did what they asked me to do so they had the proper information. One time it meant going in on the verge of suicide i was in such bad withdrawals. Don't go in with a blatant honest attitude and you will always get skewed results and improper treatment plans. I am currently on 75 mg once a day of methadone, once I stop taking it I don't really start feeling uncomfortable until 2.5 days later, each persons metabolism is different. It is gonna be the paramount of suck, but imo follow the directions and do what you have to to get the proper treatment. 

At the time I was in withdrawal he'll, now I barely remember it, suffering is a fleeting feeling.

Good luck on your journey friend whatever you choose"

Methadone,ff37zsb,t3_erbefl,1579535854.0,"Way to go all of you, all of us on methadone have a connection, we have all been through some shit and/or are continuing to go through some shit.

It can feel lonely, even if you are surrounded by people. Because people who aren't on Methadone just have no clue, they here meth, and boom judgement time, they don't take the time to educate themselves. They hear Meth and automatically their brain goes ""Breaking Bad"", not knowing Methadone is an entirely different thing.

I'm currently on 75 mg a day and have take homes for the week, sometimes i take 2 or 3 in one day. I don't notice withdrawal symptoms until w and a half days after my last dose. But for the last two weeks have been sticking to one a day as there is really no benefit to double or triple dosing for me.

But a big virtual hug to all of you in this thread, none of us can never be truly alone if we make ourselves available to one another if you need to talk. Take care all and I hope you al have a great day"
