Dear lord, this is (part of) how we got into the housing bubble.  Many people could do this with little risk, but we had lots more people with no backstop to their home ownership mortgaging everything to the limit to buy houses."

I've seen blatant racism in Egypt toward black descendants of the former Nubian empire, which controlled Egypt around the time of pharaohs. Casual racism from boat captains in BVI.  It's pretty prevalent in Australia, and all of Asia.

I'm going to keep assuming that New Zealand is now entirely racism free, and I'll hold to that belief until I go there some day."

I didn't do that.  You made that up.  You lied.

I compared bat shit crazy Americans for Trump to bat shit crazy Russians for Putin, not the American ""style"" of government vs. the Russian ""style"" (like it's a fashion choice; how inarticulate of you).

Your side literally wears t-shirts to Trump rallies that say, ""Better Russian than Democrat"".  Like I said. Bat. Shit. Crazy."
