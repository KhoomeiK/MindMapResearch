PokemonGoMystic,fffavy5,t1_ffeckfb,1579879911.0,I came here to warn you too. So boring when you evolve it but do amazing in orange!
pics,ff6tqgr,t1_ff6hbns,1579634694.0,I am glad you focused on the sweetness and revelry of Midommar instead of the dark side. I was scrutinizing the lovely painting w/ a sort of hesitancy for some of the darker underside.
funny,ff6tflr,t1_ff6f69v,1579634517.0,Yeah. They should have said something like 'it all came down to the cat keeping focus and it all came together thanks to him (her?)!!!' Cat for the win!!
politics,ff6slrp,t1_ff6opb5,1579634024.0,"Then that means that the Russian bots did not get to you. To way too many it did. I have asked people that say they deplore Trump why they didn't vote for her and they say stupid things like 'I just don't trust her.' or 'She is cold.' I call shenanigans on both and many other idiotic rote responses. Don't like her policies, fine. Don't trust her or think she should be more 'womanly, warm or motherly' is BS. She is what we NEEDED."
aww,feyq7ix,t1_fexn289,1579449205.0,My lover dovers asshole orange cat does these things as well and particularly excels at the door thing. Especially in from of the TV while we are playing games and cleaning himself in front of whatever control we need. But he is so cute we just struggle to figure it out while aww-ing over his adorable asshole self.
news,feu2mlh,t1_feso56l,1579382532.0,Or a Supreme Court Justice
politics,feogenq,t1_fenkmcd,1579299787.0,"I don't get how any woman supports them. I don't get how anyone other than misogynistic, racist, rapist (or supporters) support them. And don't 'But Abortions' me..."
aww,fenjwvv,t1_fendpa3,1579286284.0,you should post a different and equally cute pic of your flufferhead and just title it 'this is my dog' or 'this is my dog. bask in his glory'
IAmA,feni6rm,t1_fempmnz,1579285224.0,Also even if you are the type of a person that always thinks of other people first and want no one else to suffer what you went through in the aftermath of rape your mind and body no longer feel like your own. You feel weak and powerless. You may not be afraid that they will get you or repeat it but you feel like you failed in some way. So even if you wish with all of your being that you could punish that motherfucker and stop them from doing it again it is also just a huge feat to get out of bed in the morning and look at yourself. The idea of going to the police and dealing w/ them asking questions like 'did you lead them on? What were you wearing? Why were they allowed in your room/apt in the first place? Did you say no? Did you fight?' Those things are so much more terrifying than when you have a cold clear mind. You might now wish you had done it then and KNOW you would now but that just isn't necessarily true. It is terrifying and destroys who you are.
aww,fek3ej8,t1_fejev64,1579191769.0,You have not ever seen Teddy?
news,fedx3ou,t1_fedprew,1579021733.0,I think it would be absolutely hilarious if Fox News anchors took this to heart and also stepped down from their years of lying thanking Trump for kicking off truthiness.
Enhancement,feck1nb,t1_fdqax2f,1578975807.0,I wish a human would help. I have gotten tired of seeing them so much so that I have stopped logging in. It is killing my desire to actually post.
aww,fece1cn,t1_febhu1a,1578971686.0,"We are also dechonking our cats. We adopted Morty last year who was a street rescue and he discovered that it was super fun to scarf down Gir's food which made them both bulk up. Here is a photo that I think rivals the quality of Cuddles dechonkifying. It is Gir being cuddle/congratulated for losing .5 lb.    [https://imgur.com/gallery/Fose8p4](https://imgur.com/gallery/Fose8p4)  (kidding, it is a pretty bad photo but it cracked me up as he left his leg like that for a couple of minutes he was so disgruntled.) This one is better  [https://imgur.com/gallery/9qGYoYO](https://imgur.com/gallery/9qGYoYO)"
Otters,fdo8ku9,t3_emeq0u,1578600759.0,For years now I have started meetings w/ this as my wallpaper when people seem to be in conflict. It shuts their brains off for a minute and lets them reboot.
Pareidolia,fdo88zz,t1_fdnzkcj,1578600603.0,Yes. This can/box is way more attractive than Trump. Not trashy enough.
secretsanta,fdl7c5w,t3_elvd20,1578518277.0,"My favorite was when I was about to put a bow on a gift when Gary (the cat, not the snail) came TEARING in from the other room and snatched the bow out of my hands, bounced off the couch and the ottoman and threw the bow away like it was a bomb and he had saved my life. My daughter and I cried w/ laughter."
movies,fdh48tt,t3_elbpt8,1578415042.0,Charlize Theron 2020!
aww,fcvjvqn,t1_fctizhc,1578003653.0,The poor female is just trying to get away and seems stuck in the grass. My friend sent me a video of his 2 tortoises and Betty is just doing her best to walk away and pretend Elmo is not doing what he is doing (or making those noises). Meanwhile Olga the goose is looking on and honking in disapproval. It was pretty funny.
secretsanta,fbwgklj,t1_fbvqdvd,1577149361.0,exposing it and printing is even lovelier! I had a dark room in college and miss it.
