facepalm,fdgv8d5,t1_fdgsymj,1578409162.0,I remember there being a really common story about Peta kidnapping and killing random pets. Is that even remotely true? I don’t recall ever finding evidence anything like that happened.
facepalm,fdgscpn,t1_fdgs06x,1578407080.0,"There are thousands of stray dogs and cats that will never have a home to live in. Those dogs and cats will breed to produce thousands of more animals that will also have a hard time finding a home. Those animals will also feed off of and diminish local wildlife. 

As terrible as euthanasia is... it’s sometimes the best option in the long run."

Regardless if heâ€™s a bad person or not, itâ€™s still a tragic event that did nothing but contribute to Americaâ€™s daily gun violence. Even if X was a terrible person, now a kidâ€™s going to grow up without a father and a mother lost her son. I rather he had just gone to jail and served his time. 

Anyone that says he deserved to die is just looking to be put on some moral high ground."
