There has been no official investigation into the Clinton emails, it's only a controversy, to me. I say this because it was her good buddy Comey ""investigating"" her..I mean the lady even destroyed her cell phones with a hammer...imagine what she was doing behind the scenes. You or It was definitely illegal and she is LUCKY Trump hasn't gone after her...As a matter of fact, that's one of my gripes about him is he is too fair to people who attack him constantly.
Assuming that Trump supporters don't look passed what he says, is another moral high-ground that democrats think they have over us. It's not true...I'm actually a half-Mexican ex Bernie supporter, so I've played both sides of the fence. 
The holidays were wonderful. I just got to entertain some friends, which was good. How about you?"

I hate seeing my country like this. I hate the fact that I can't come out as a Trump supporter, without being judged Hard...that's what I dislike about the left...Their moral highground, where we are pieces of shit and they are holier than thou and say what is right in society."
