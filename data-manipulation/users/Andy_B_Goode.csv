Also, Canada seems to have had no trouble at all switching to Celsius for weather. Many Canadians (myself included) are still in the habit of using feet, inches, pounds, etc in day-to-day life, but for weather we seem to be completely Celsius, unless you talk to someone who grew up before the switch. Hell, we still typically have Fahrenheit on our ovens, so I have a pretty good idea of what cooking something at 350F means, but an outdoor temperature of 35F? Haven't a clue unless I do a rough conversion in my head.

I actually think switching to Celsius would be a good first step for the US, because it involves minimal infrastructure changes, and because doing the conversion mentally is such a PITA.

>In most English-speaking regions, particularly the United States and the Commonwealth, the 12-hour clock is the predominant form of stating the time, with the 24-hour clock used in contexts where unambiguity and accurate timekeeping are important, such as for public transport schedules. Nonetheless, usage is inconsistent: in the UK, train timetables will typically use 24-hour time, but road signs indicating time restrictions (e.g. on bus lanes) typically use 12-hour time, e.g. ""Monday–Friday 6.30–8.30pm"". The BBC website uses the 24-hour clock for its TV and radio programme listings, while BBC promotions for upcoming programmes give their times according to the 12-hour clock. Punctuation and spacing styles differ, even within English-speaking countries (6:30 p.m., 6:30 pm, 6.30pm, etc.).

I'm conflicted about cracking down on you because you're basically the only other person who posts content on this subreddit, but this isn't the kind of content that /r/rollsomememes is supposed to be about. In addition to not really being a meme, it seems unnecessarily mean-spirited towards Serra, not to mention more than a little misogynistic.

I'm removing this post, but I'll leave your previous ones up. You're free to continue posting for now, but please make a point of submitting more meme-like content, such as images, short animated gifs or short videos. I'll update the rules in the sidebar to reflect this change as well."
