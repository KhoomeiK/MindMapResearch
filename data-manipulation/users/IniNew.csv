They allow third party sellers, and even offer next day shipping for free, with no membership fees. 

When's the last time you were on walmart.com?"

And stop charging an hourly rate! Value price yourself :)"
technology,ffurwns,t1_ffuq0zr,1580248195.0,Sounds like your camera achieved nothing but giving you something to laugh at afterwards.
Foodforthought,ffum3iq,t1_ffuiu82,1580244846.0,"> My issue is that whose opinion do we listen to? Different people have different opinions, so what if he has someone on that you think is a racist but I do not?

Totally agree with you! 

It's a personal line. The OP of the article clearly doesn't like Rogan and the people he has on the show. Its their opinion. I'm still not sure how I feel about the matter."
Entrepreneur,ffufouv,t1_ffsh12g,1580240978.0,"Pretty interesting considering how the US economy, specifically, is speeding towards a service economy."
Foodforthought,ffuf055,t1_ffu938n,1580240569.0,"The vast majority of his guests might not be far right. He seems to be willing to talk to damn near anyone.

The ratio of his guests political views doesn't matter. It's giving a microphone to people who, in some opinions, doesn't deserve to have one. It's morally wrong, to them, to give those people an outlet to further their position. 

As far as responsibility goes, when you've got that kind of audience, you do have some sort of responsibility. You're not whispering into individual's ears, but giving someone a chance to hear intentionally radicalizing viewpoints that may turn joe-schmoe into a alt-right-not-really-but-definitely-is-a-nazi, does he not bare some of the blame?"
Foodforthought,ffu2xoy,t1_fftrelg,1580233351.0,"All comes down to the paradox of tolerance.

Joe Rogan gives an outlet to people under the umbrella of free speech, that quite frankly, shouldn't be given that outlet. He knows that controversy drives views, listens, and clicks and absolutely does it for that. 

For many, giving far-right, mostly fascists white supremacists an outlet to give their opinions is grounds for hate. I can't decide where my line falls, as far as who should be allowed the huge audience or not, it's a personal decision, really. But I can understand both sides of the arguments."
gayyoungold,ffe2zpj,t1_fexceyk,1579835358.0,"Well, if I think about it from the other perspective. As some one that's almost exclusively dated older men (closest age gap was 8 years), I have a hard time considering dating guys near my age, or even younger, to be very fruitful. 

I can see why he'd think the opposite."
Foodforthought,ff9b5ws,t1_ff8fnu8,1579708966.0,"Texan here, so we're heavily car dependent. I take the train to work most days. 

The bus being free will not stop people here from taking their car. The buses are hard to navigate for first timers, and do not offer the comfort or safety that hoping in your own car does. Short trips are even less incentive to get on one, as part of the appeal of buses is you don't have to focus on driving."
personalfinance,ff98eye,t1_ff8l2xb,1579707235.0,"Working on purchasing my second condo.

It includes maintenance of all shared property (plumbing outside of the walls, exterior, roof, grounds and parking areas, pools, etc etc), exterior insurance, access to pool, gym, and other amenities, and usually includes water/waste/sewer.

Some more expensive HOAs also include things like 24/7 concierge, valet, and other services like that."

userexperience,fei2ovr,t1_fehys3y,1579128962.0,"It's used because it's the largest single stop marketing place. Full stop.

It has everything. And all of it can be at your door in 1-2 days.

Where else can you go to order a book, toilet paper, a drone, and a new pair of shoes in a single transaction?"
userexperience,fehl5a2,t3_ep71gi,1579118765.0,"It's hot garbage. One of the absolute worst places to shop online. 

Some of it is Amazon's fault, directly. Some of it is the 3rd party sellers. But either way you cut it, if you're not wanting the first 3-5 search results... good luck."
technology,feeabv8,t1_fee3bme,1579029656.0,"I think the point is that a backdoor was built into these walks, which was then leaked and exploited. Just like what happens with software."

hockey,feaiyom,t1_fea7cut,1578949441.0,Because there's a huge discussion going on about how badly Kassian kicked his ass lol. I would be embarrassed if there was a video of me getting tossed around like a rag doll.
hockey,fe9sceo,t1_fe9ckwl,1578941024.0,"I doubt it's as black and white as you're trying to show. 

I agree that Tkachuk had that coming. And Kassian straight embarrassed him. 

I also agree that the hits were borderline, and depending on who's reffing, and what part of the season it's in, could be called either way."
gayyoungold,fds96gr,t1_fdqj6c1,1578697236.0,"> But if that's the case he really has no right to deny OP meeting his physical needs elsewhere

You had me until this part. 

He absolutely does. If he is not comfortable with opening up the relationship, he has the option to say no. The OP can accept that, or he can move on."
malelivingspace,fdo5mzx,t1_fdo1gka,1578599319.0,"They have one of these stores in my local mall. We always joke that ""within reach"" means you can walk in and touch it. Can't buy it, though."
Foodforthought,fdkclf3,t3_elpd0l,1578501028.0,I wonder what the headlines were like when reading and writing became mainstream skills.
Foodforthought,fdh7mm0,t1_fdgx1vt,1578417131.0,"I was in a motorcycle wreck (hit and run, driver never stopped) when I was 22. 

The ambulance arrived and asked if I wanted to be taken to the hospital after I regained consciousness. I said yes, because I figured ""I have health insurance.""

Between the ambulance ride, the MRI (that only revealed I was congested, thanks doc!), and the cleaning of my wounds, I ended up paying on those medical bills for 5 years."

worldnews,fcv9s44,t1_fcv1f59,1577997613.0,Trump is not a dictator. He's not thoughtful enough to be one. He's a rash. The problem is the Republicans who don't give a shit what he's doing because they're getting their agendas through.
personalfinance,fcv55rd,t1_fcuvdri,1577994863.0,It's... not? Mine does. And then some.
personalfinance,fcunx28,t1_fcuh1uo,1577985007.0,I did chuckle that part of the problem he has with the company is the founders having side hustles. So he wants less responsibility to focus on his side hustles.
personalfinance,fcunugn,t1_fcun571,1577984968.0,It's saying that work isn't the top priority. And that's how it should be.

hockey,fcubhgn,t1_fcrsohb,1577977093.0,"In the arena, it was so weird. They wouldn't show a replay of it on the jumbotron. And since the shot had just happened, a lot of people didn't even see what happen. Just saw Ellis down and then Perry getting ejected."

Giving you feedback on the work, and the presentation shouldn't be awkward at all. Just be ready for some feedback. It's usually very constructive."
