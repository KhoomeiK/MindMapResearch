Game three James had 2 to Ken's 1, but timing was important here because Ken had more to wager than James did (9,200 for Ken, 6400 for James), and Ken won.

That's the entire point I'm making. That's not true. He wins without the DD. It is the exact opposite -- James needs to rely on the DDs if he wants to win. This is supported by basic math. If a basketball team lost by 10 would you point to a random 4 point play by their opponent in the first half and say that that was the entire reason they lost?

James's trivia knowledge is immense. He got over 95% of the questions right, which is slightly less than his career percentage of 96%. I assume he would be ringing in on most questions especially to keep control of the board and therefore the DDs, but Ken was dominant on the buzzer yesterday.

Ken 48 correct responses to James' 39

James did have a higher % of correct responses (39/41 to Ken's 48/53) and overall I think he has the greatest knowledge capital, but this entire tournament will hinge on who buzzes in consistently and has a better chance at the DDs,and if Ken keeps up his buzzer dominance he should expect to see most of them. If James or Brad (who I would expect to return to form next match) get lucky and snag them though, it's anyone's game"

ChoosingBeggars,fcxn1ml,t1_fcxml6s,1578066844.0,"Eh, I don't see it that way. I agree with the UN that women and children suffer immensely in domestic armed conflicts, and on top of that face increased family responsibilities when they lose their spouse/family. [70% of the victims of armed conflict are civilians](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/07/war-disproportionately-affects-women-female-peacekeepers-fiona-hodgson), many of which are women and children, who are often brutalized. 

Keep in mind that she didn't really minimize male suffering in armed conflict, and also understand the context of the quote was at some sort of domestic violence conference and was targeted towards a female demographic and you'll see that it's not as bad as it sounds."
