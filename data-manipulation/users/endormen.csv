You are still using very small chunks of time as a reference point to claim that it is not natural. If you use data that only covers the current cycle of course it will say things are odd right now, as we exit a cycle. 3 of the last 6 million years where considerably warmer then it is now and are the predicted temperature spike. if you look at things on a larger scale the normal Is rapid changes and spikes. the change is what is normal. what is insane is to try and argue that temperatures should be the same for long periods of time.

Incorrect. the water surface is never still due to filtration, the water is also filled with both bacterial predators, microorganism predators, Arthropod predators, and fish predators. It also attracts birds and bats that are both predators of the mosquito. Meaning that any mosquito that attempts to breed in my pond is likely to be eaten by a bird, bat, fish, spider, or nymph assuming it can can find anywhere to land.  the young that do manage to get into the water are destroyed by the healthy culture of bacteria that not only can consume them but also produce spores that kill them. Should any survive that they are attacked by a multitude of micro organisms that see them as food. Should they survive that they are attacked by fish.

My pond actually kills more mosquitoes then it produces, unlike grassy lawns, or the gutters on a house. 

I am glad you asked about that common misconception about garden ponds. It is amazing how many people where poorly educated about the breeding habits of mosquitoes."
TrueOffMyChest,fcb2ah3,t1_fcas8lc,1577581347.0,"Post traumatic stress is a product of traumatic stress. Anyone that has experienced traumatic stress will have post traumatic stress. It's part of how our brains respond to it and try and prevent/prepare for new traumatic events.

The disorder part is when people stop functioning from it. when it takes over and breaks the person.

I feel like a lot of people dealing with post traumatic stress tell people what they are going thru in that healing possess and get labeled with PTSD, and are told they are sick and that experiencing the symptoms that come from traumatic events means they are still sick.

We all have nightmares. We all feel overwhelmed. we all feel insignificant. We all feel despair. We all experience paranoia. It is human to feel every emotion. Its human to feel no emotion. 

Sometimes. Sure stuff is more intense now, You experienced shit that was beyond your wildest fears, your brain raised the bar on what can go wrong. Now things are more intense, that is human.
By all means talk share and look in the mirror, but don't beat yourself up thinking it is something bad or wrong or sick. roll with it.

If its not sometimes? if its killing you? if you just need to tell someone and cant? if you don't know? No mater how much you live that void sucks it all away and your to fucking exhausted to bother with anything and skipped to the end well skiming? make a call. we still need you."

It can turn on and send that video any time you start talking about your political opinions to see what triggers you to talk about an issue you care about, and what causes you to stop talking about it and it is sent to a political think tank that wants to know how to distract you from something you care about so you don't vote this year."

BikiniBottomTwitter,fcaiub7,t1_fcaglpd,1577569996.0,"I understand what you are saying, but for sub-mastery knowledge you don't need to fully understand something to teach it. Your goal is to teach a person how to learn, you teach good study habits and critical thinking, you teach logic and reason. When a student knows how to learn they don't need a subject mater expert to teach them they need a mentor and a supervisor to keep them on track. General knowledge is not the goal of lower education, its a byproduct. the goal is someone that can teach themselves what they need from information they can obtain. We don't need parrots that can squawk facts books and indexs do that job far more exactly.

Teaching people to learn is something most people can do. as long as our schools have teachers that are drunks passing out in the back of the class well an outdated documentary plays, teachers that are more interested in abusing there students then teaching, or teachers that burned out and are just marking time to their pension and schools that don't care enough to fix it, like many if not most of us experienced its hard to argue that a devoted parent trying to (re)learn a subject along side there kid can be worse."

If you want bugs be proactive, turn your space into a rest stop. you can do it with a window box or a field. if you don't have land or a window and are a bit of a rebel /r/GuerrillaGardening/ may be interesting. If none of that appeals i assure you there is a wetland, park, forest, or preserve that needs volunteers to collect seeds, to kill invasive species, to plant trees, to educate or any other task.

The main perk of home schooling a kid is the teacher to student ratio Sure they may not manage as well as a professional teacher, but they also don't need to multi-task 40 kids. The person teaching from home has way more time to spend on the student so even if they don't do it as efficiently they can be just as effective with more effort spent per student. test numbers seem to show that home school kids are actually taught more effectively, but there are some uncontrolled variables in that data."

If you want to try grow many of them so you can transplant multiple plants at one time, and have a breeding stock if the first few rounds fail to take getting plants use to dirt to grow in only water is challenging and ends up in a lot of dead plants.
