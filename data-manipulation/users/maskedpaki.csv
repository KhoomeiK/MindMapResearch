functionally all neurotransmitters can be modelled as just activators and repressors of adjacent neurons. Thats literally all they do. Sometimes a positive neurotransmitter activates a negative pathway so it performs the reciprocal of its usual function. (In the nervous system GABA circuits are negative and glutamate is positive though this is just a convention for neuroscientists)

 There is no magic dust in any neurotransmitter. Thats why no one mapping the connectome cares much at all. We can also simulate the human brains intelligence without worrying too much about the actual materials."

the market is an evolutionary game and like any evolutionary game it will end with one massive winner and an earth full of losers. The last evolutionary game allowed humans to win and subjugated all the millions of other species on the planet to the whims of humans.

exmuslim,fe4xo66,t1_fe3o1oj,1578863807.0,"you beat me to it. I used to do this sort of thing for these ""numerical miracles"" as well. 

now i dont anymore and for this reason.

If a muslim says the quran is beyond human capacity I say I agree (just for the sake of argument. The quran is beyond human capacity.

&#x200B;

but something being beyond human capacity doesnt mean its from God. It can be from any supernatural entity that isnt God if the supernatural does in fact exist. A devil, an angel a deva..

we have no information about the supernatural. To assert that if the supernatural exists and the quran comes from the supernatural therefore its from God is baseless even IF the quran was full of miracles beyond human capability to produce.

&#x200B;

This is the fallacy of miracles pointed out by theramin trees. If a prophet performs a miracle no matter how splendid. It does not follow that his claims are true. Merely that the world has more to it than you previously thought. The source of a miracle cannot be demonstrated to be God so long as the possibility of non-god supernatural entities exist. This demolishes any intellectual grounding islam had because no matter how many ""signs"" you provide. You cannot link a sign to an alleged source of the sign."
