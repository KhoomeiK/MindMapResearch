I left out the part where I then pointed out basically what you said and he responded that Biden shouldn't be able to get away with it just because Trump stands to gain from him going down. His exact example was ""if I murder someone, I don't get to get away with it if a cop benefits from the investigation."" The mental gymnastics are staggering."
worldnews,ffcn3tw,t1_ffchpof,1579802969.0,"I had someone IRL actually use the argument that since he was trying to investigate corruption it shouldn't matter that he stood to personally gain from doing it. 

I don't even know how to respond to things like that. If that's what someone really thinks, there isn't anything I can say to change their mind."

Funny, coming from the person actively lighting the friendship on fire over not wanting to pay a few hundred dollars."

okboomer,fdnf3xh,t1_fdl93m9,1578584462.0,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Boomer The Obtuse? I thought not. It’s not a story the Millennials would tell you. Darth Boomer was, so out of touch and so stubborn she could use the memes to influence the kids to get off of their phones… She had such a knowledge of the memes that she could even keep the ones she cared about from getting participation trophies. Being older is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. Unfortunately, she spent so much time memeing that she was on her phone day and night. Ironic. She could save others from the phones, but not herself."
PokemonCirclejerk,fdn7sqx,t3_em8gsz,1578579614.0,"I'm honestly kind of confused by all of the attention Temtem got with the angry Pokemon community.

I thought that the main reason they hate Sword and Shield was because of dexit and that these were Pokemon they grew up with and have attachment to, and yet they promote a knockoff alternate game that will have NONE of those favorite Pokemon in it.

Edit: As for my opinion on it, I'll try it and play it if it's good, it being a knockoff doesn't really bother me, especially since it's on PC which has no Pokemon games outside of emulation."

Granted, the damn thing comes with an actual quesadilla on the side, but all together it was like 1400 calories. It's less calories to get a burger and fries at that point!"

news,fdlbwz8,t1_fdl6sfz,1578520735.0,They just came out with a new one about a week ago about gofundme.
MortalKombat,fdlaebc,t1_fdl0wx6,1578519835.0,Also Killer Instinct with Xbox and PC since whenever the PC version came out. Street Fighter V was still first though.
fatlogic,fdkhbjn,t1_fdkbhww,1578503878.0,"Meanwhile, the skinny friend doesn't eat pizza often and indulged while hanging out with friends, while the fat person eats pizza much more often. The skinny person might spend some extra time at the gym or have a small salad as a meal later to counteract the pizza, while the fat person just goes out and gets more fast food. On average, the fat person eats way much more and more often. 

I know these things because I used to BE that fat person who was convinced it was so unfair that my skinny friend appeared to eat more than me and stay small."

pcgaming,fdhf7j2,t1_fdh6cc4,1578421376.0,It reminds me of this one Resident Evil 2 review where the reviewer complained about only being able to shoot the zombies when they wanted to be a medic and cure them instead.
fatlogic,fdgxha0,t1_fdgmryb,1578410734.0,"It's staggering how many people seem to think of a diet as something you temporarily do just to get down to a target weight, and then go right back to how you used to eat before starting it. Like you said, it's actually insane, doing the exact same thing but expecting different results."
fatlogic,fdgx2vl,t3_elb410,1578410457.0,"Wait, so you followed the diet and lost a bunch of weight, but then gained it all back when you went back to exactly how you were eating that made you fat in the first place and the logical conclusion is that diets just don't work? 

With that logic, nothing works. ""I weight trained for years and got stronger, but then stopped completely and eventually got weak again. Lifting weights doesn't work!"" ""I studied advanced math for years in college, but after not using any of it for a decade I can't remember anything! College just doesn't work!"" ""I've been taking medicine to manage my chronic pain, but after I stopped taking it, I still hurt! Medicine doesn't work!"""

They were just so overdone with way too many ingredients and flavors, and had a horrible ratio of meat to veggies because of their size. If I wanted a half a bag of lettuce wrapped up with only a smidge of chicken, I would have just gone to Subway."
Gamingcirclejerk,fdgr7uo,t1_fdgceqt,1578406224.0,"Not only that, while the books ARE based in part on Slavic folk tales, they also include elements from all sorts of of other folk tales and classic fairy tales in general in order to poke fun at their tropes. The world itself is an entirely fictional one which includes many different cultures, regions, and skin colors, and probably the strongest theme throughout the books is ""racism bad, bigotry bad,"" etc."

politics,fbepoju,t1_fbemwfi,1576791042.0,"Honestly, it terms of it being cadets (or young service members in general), I'm like 99% they're just playing the circle game. I'm not saying it's totally impossible that they're racist or intentionally making the hand sign in a racist way, but context is key and I still regularly see it as an immature game among soldiers to this day. I refuse to believe everyone I seen do it is actually a secret neo-nazi or kkk member."
