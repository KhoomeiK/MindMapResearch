Its normal in the same way that a blue lobster is normal. Like it or not, the first thing people are going to do when they see such a lobster is ask questions. The difference is that we can see that a lobster is blue, acknowledge it as fact, and know it in our hearts. Clear as day, that lobster is blue. Sadly, we as a society can't do the same for trans people. To a lot of people, saying you're a girl when you were born with a penis is as ridiculous as claiming to be an attack helicopter, hence the meme. If we want people to accept trans people to be accepted, we need to explain it in some way, or at the very least be somewhat receptive to questions asked. Saying ""I don't need to explain myself"", while true, doesn't help that person understand, therefore they won't necessarily accept trans identities. Now I am not expecting trans people to act as a hotline to people who want to know more, but shutting down any line of questioning isn't productive.

todayilearned,fd058o5,t1_fczpas8,1578113813.0,"> That's true, but you'll never increase your win percentage

What? yes you can. Your win percentage is just a culmination of your average W/L. If you waste time a lot of time on games where you only have a 1% chance of winning, you're not spending that time winning other matches with favorable odds. These wins can offset the losses, increasing your win percentage given time.

Take league for instance. For this example, you can either surrender a game at 15 minutes, or almost certainly lose it at 30 minutes. However, there is a 5% chance you come back if you don't surrender. Lets say you drag out 100 games that seem unwinnable, with only 5 of these efforts resulting in a come back and eventual victory. Lets also assume you get 10 imaginary skill points(ISP) for a victory, and lose 10 ISP for a loss.

You play 100 of these games, and lose 95 of them. This results in a loss of 950 ISP instead of 1000 ISP. That's 50 ISP saved, right? Not so fast, you spent 1500 minutes, or 25 hours, to gain only 50 ISP.

Assuming the average league match takes 20 minutes(for maths), and your winrate is 55%, was it worth the time investment?

In 25 hours you can play 75 matches. With a 55% winrate, you win 41 of these 75 matches, and lose 34. This is a net gain of 70 ISP, which is higher than the 50 ISP gain you earned by dragging out every game. This delta increases with every ""unwinnable"" game you drag out. Because your ISP gain/loss is always 10, it directly correlates with your Win/loss percentage.

Time isn't the only resource you're spending either. Playing out horrible games because there's a tiny chance you can still win is going to have a horrible effect on your morale. Unless you have the mental fortitude of a god, these shit games will make you tilt unless you take breaks between matches.

Essentially, women have more value than men on a biological level because they are the ones who bear children. 10 men and 100 women can create the next generation, whereas 10 women and 100 men cannot. So if a war breaks out, its better to send most of your men to fight and die, rather than even a minority of your women. This is reflected in biology with men traditionally having superior strength physicality. If this is theory is true, it likely dates back millions of years to when we were a simpler species and survival was a constant struggle.

That being said, this is just a theory, so it very easily could be wrong.

ContraPoints,fcv1zf0,t1_fcuyj3n,1577992979.0,"While it is true religious people often try to proselytize, for the sake of argument, I am discounting that for this equivalence. My analogy is meant to compare a person's relationship with their god, and a person's relationship with their gender. Neither concept exists in nature, and socially both are almost equally prevalent. The church simply has more people backing it. Religious people very much do have a personal relationship with their faith, and I can accept and respect that, while thinking it is incorrect. Why is it different for trans ideas.

I want to again make clear that I *do* believe in transgender identities."
ContraPoints,fcv0wfo,t1_fcuzawx,1577992374.0,"> Do you think gender expression is ultimately fabricated?

Yes, and that's exactly why I don't understand non-binary people, specifically those that socially present as their sex. If you're disavowing gender stereotypes, that's great. I think the world could only be better if literally everybody did this. I wish I would have the courage to commit to this ideal, so I truly do admire people who are comfortable living outside the gender binary.

Why then adopt the mantle of NB? This is where they completely lose me. Wouldn't it be better to reduce ourselves to sex, then reduce our sex to an insignificant part of our lives? All of our expression would be completely true to the person, and have nothing to do with our gender, because we would abandon gender as a concept. Why would any of this make you trans? This is where the trans medical idea makes sense to me. Dysphoria is real, whether it be muscle dysphoria, weight dysphoria, gender dysphoria, or whatever else. Why are we lumping people with a medical condition with people who don't believe in traditional concepts of gender?

Like I said, I respect whatever pronouns people ask me to use, but I fundamentally disagree with the line of thinking."

ContraPoints,fcuwhkt,t3_eizod0,1577989941.0,"She makes the same argument about womanhood that religious people do about god. 

""Why do you believe in god?""

""Because I do, I have faith, and I don't need to explain that""

Which is fine, Their belief is valid, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna start believing in a god.

""Why are you a woman?""

""Because I am, I know I am, and I don't need to explain that""

Which again, is fine, but its not going to make me see you as a woman. To be clear, I *do* believe Natalie is a woman, and I *do* respect people's pronouns, but I sometimes don't truly accept what non-binary people are telling me. Whenever a consistently female/male presenting person tells me they're non-binary, I kind of just smile and nod. 
 
Is this transphobic? Maybe I am wrong, I don't know. However, their argument almost
validates the trans-medical view point. I can see why trans people
who believe in that theory would be annoyed at these ""transtrenders"" for diluting the message. They're clearly two different groups that we insist on banding under the same umbrella. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me. NB are valid, but, to me, I don't see them as trans, atleast not in the same way.

Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think society is anywhere near ready to be okay with accept ""because I said so"" as a valid argument for trans acceptance. Don't get me wrong, I am all for trans acceptance, but this feels nonproductive.

Edit: I don't understand why people downvote without engaging in the conversation. How am I meant to know what is wrong with what I said?

Edit 2: Ty everyone for the discussion, but I gotta go do some real life stuff now."
