datascience,fde3uv9,t1_fde2x0b,1578330585.0,"You're right about the field names; unintuitive and the schema is clumsy and tough to work through. I've spent hours on the custom fields due to the sheer amount of them, there's a lot of custom fields that are actually important variables in the analytics.

datascience,fczixm8,t1_fcziado,1578102253.0,That's sounds good given that you're still finishing your degree! Cleaning data can be very very tedious at times. At least your company is becoming more data focused!

datascience,fcz01g1,t1_fcyvw2o,1578090882.0,"I have a repo with a couple  SQL queries I wrote that pull the necessary data from their database, all they'd have to do is update the database and execute each queryand they'd have several nicely structured tables. Although cleaning and analysis inis a different story.

I met their old COO recently and he was pushing and pushing for months before he left to get someone to look at their data so maybe they felt their hand was forced into getting a data scientist and were hoping I could just figure it all out for them"
datascience,fcyz9zl,t1_fcyx6xy,1578090391.0,I like your idea of a screen recording/ video presentation. It would help show them the complexity and help them understand the whole process of what I actually do
datascience,fcyz3i0,t1_fcyxudk,1578090276.0,"Great comment, lot of hard truths in there. I agree, it's not something I should attempt given what little time and experience I have."
datascience,fcyycgk,t1_fcyvezz,1578089791.0,"That sounds brilliant! I'd love to be part of a data team and be able to discuss different ways of approaching a problem, different tools etc.

 I find it really fulfilling to get raw data directly from the source and then work through the whole process to the final result, even if it feels impossibly hard at times, it's an engaging position. The expectation is more than what I can produce alone unfortunately. It is a small company to be fair which, like you said, I'm expected to be a jack of all trades"
datascience,fcyut3m,t1_fcyu306,1578087547.0,"If only I was a software engineer too.

 I was questioned about this ""tool"" in September/October and explained that it would be very difficult to do on my own and with the work already on my plate, it just wasn't feasible.  I heard nothing after that and assumed it was understood until I was asked about it again this week.

Thanks for the encouragement, the experience im getting is great and hopefully I can help them"

datascience,fcysev5,t1_fcyrt1n,1578086075.0,Exactly. It'd be naive of me to think otherwise
datascience,fcysbfi,t1_fcyrwvr,1578086018.0,For real? I've actually just completed my dissertation this week. Thanks for your advice! Great stuff
datascience,fcys4mp,t1_fcyren7,1578085903.0,Brilliant comparison! The last thing I want is to be at odds with them or come across as dismissive but the point you made is spot on. They need some human expertise to accomplish their task and answer their questions
datascience,fcyrkwn,t1_fcypyrt,1578085593.0,Great advice. I've been commenting all my code as I created it (purely because I have a tendency to write functions and a week later forget why I did it and lose clean dataframes in the mess of unclean dataframes)  so if the next person is handy enough with R and SQL they should be ok
datascience,fcyqxab,t1_fcypeyf,1578085233.0,Lol that's what it feels like but hey I started off as an intern and I'm still grateful for the opportunity. Although advantage is being taken at this stage because of their higher than high expectations of me as an intern
datascience,fcyql1d,t1_fcypdff,1578085051.0,"Very true. It could be their best  path forward, financially. I was delighted to get the position and another student would jump at the chance to take it."

datascience,fcymqc5,t1_fcyjsl6,1578082906.0,They don't have anyone else looking at their data apart from me. I don't think they see the true value in data science if I'm being honest

datascience,fcyjkxi,t1_fcycvut,1578081149.0,"Thanks for your advice. I think you're right; I need to explain that this something I can't do. It's like talking to a wall sometimes, if they don't like the results they just don't want to hear it and expect the whole process to be a simple process"
