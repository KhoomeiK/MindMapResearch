MakeupRehab,ffie9y5,t3_etp6io,1579971795.0,"Im in the middle of changing my diet and fitness level. Ive had to buy new clothes so I have things that fit. But i buy one or two pairs of pants and one to two shirts and thats it. Its not worth buying more when a i work from home and wear the same things all the time and honestly a huge wardrobe is a waste of space and just encourages me to wait longer to do laundry. 

Once I'm maintaining my weight I'm planning on thrifting a capsule wardrobe. I want pieces that all mix and match that fit well. I can add splashes of color with makeup and seasonal things like coats and hats etc.   

I'm hoping to take a sewing class to learn how to alter clothes so I can just worry about fabrics i like from the thrift store ans than learn to adjust them to work for my body."

It's working at work so far I just need to do more to be productive at home.

careerguidance,ff51wan,t3_erhsup,1579577987.0,"I would say there are a few things you can do. 

1. Set up a budget and stick to it. 
2. Set up easy goals to reach to pay off debts and save. Make it as a chart to keep up for motivation.
3. Set up a routine for both going to sleep and waking up. 
4. Keep your clothes and items organized so you just have to go in the closet and grab pre done clothing sets for work and not have to hunt things down. 
5. If you can meal prep do it. Make simple things that are easy to make and easy to eat on the run/ in the car or fast when you get home. Make sure to eat lots of protein and veggies to make you feel full longer and help keep things moving. 
6. Drink lots of water and drinks with electrolytes in them. It will make a big difference."

Thank I see what I pick one thing at a time to work on. I lose my glasses all the time and have gone through many pairs. Now when I go to bed, I've gotten into the habit of taking my glasses off and putting them on my husbands night stand. I'll be less likely to knock them over in my sleep or put them on and take them off randomly. 

If i feel the need to take them off during the day, I sit them on top of my head instead of whatever I'm walking next to. 

I work on a laptop and make sure to keep it on the charger till its fully charged, pay attention to it's battery and restart every day. It helps a lot. 

I hate cleaning, I always feel like between my son and dogs its going to be destroyed in 2 seconds. I try to just wash dishes until I run out of warm water. I also do the 5-10 item rule. when I leave a rule I try to pick up 5-10 items i can toss or put away. I do that with each room as I enter or leave it. It helps to do micro cleaning sessions without feeling like I'm spending all day cleaning. 

I'm horrible about returning things. If you make plans to go to that store with a friend, and ask them to drive you and to remind you to return the item your more likely to get it done. 

I've been there where you are. My anxiety meds in the morning make a big difference as does good sleep and a healthy diet.

I allowed myself to watch it and than I broke down what I need to do into smaller bitesize pieces so it's easier and I'm not getting overwhelmed. 

It's helping a lot. I'm also trying to eat low carbs. Cutting out refine flours, sugars, rices and potatoes. I feel much better eating more protein and veggies and making myself move more. When I do something wrong at work, or have a day where my numbers are not good I sit and think about why and make notes so I don't do it again or I see what I did wrong and understand how I need to redirect my goals and focus at work.

I think the best thing to do honestly, is both pick out meals you love and in put them into a nutrition calculator and than look up substitutes for things in those dishes. 

Another easy thing to do honestly is whatever meat you are going to eat, smash it flat and bake/ roast with simple seasonings. If you prep and pre cook a variety of meats this way you can make a variety of sauces to put on top.

I thought I hated veggies to it turns out I just hate lima beans and mixed veggies (the corn, green bean, pea mix). I'm also not a fan of corn or peas.

Honestly, I like things that are easy. If I use frozen brussell sprouts, I just either bake them or sautee them in a pan with oil and bacon with some salt and pepper. I love paprika and cayenne pepper on everything and smoke paprika is sooo good. 

If they are fresh, I boil water and boil them for a minute before cooking the same as the frozen because it cuts down on the bitterness. 

I have to go back to doing this, but I used to take my veggies and cook them down and drain and than put in a blender and mix into my meatballs. 

I'm all for finding a recipe you enjoy and making it until you dont need a recipe anymore and than subbing things in and out. I enjoy things that are easier since I cook dinner while I'm working."
