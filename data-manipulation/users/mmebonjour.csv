CatAdvice,ffc0o2k,t3_espqwc,1579788523.0,"Poor grumpy kitty lol. We tried a suit with my cat when she had to have surgery and wouldn’t stop licking off her medicine from the open wound. She did the same thing as your cat. And like others said, unless your cat is picking at her stitches, you don’t need a suit or cone on them. The times I’ve had my cats spayed, they didn’t mess with them."
French,ffaqhpd,t3_esjzl2,1579742111.0,I teach French in America and have had parents say that to my face. It definitely made me feel like my job is pointless.

French,ff0ft5p,t1_feyoe25,1579468494.0,La Mante is such a good show!
DunderMifflin,fepyziu,t3_eq41ix,1579335004.0,"Season 1 was super good though. I honestly thought the show was stupid before I sat down and watched it because I didn’t know the characters and didn’t get the humor, but I was hooked after the first episode."
PandR,fepyi4c,t1_fenb3m0,1579334666.0,Me too! I started watching it because I found out she’s in it.
PandR,fepygwo,t1_fenlk0u,1579334640.0,"Me too! She was kind of just there in the first season, but after that she’s a super cool character. Definitely one of my favorites."

atheism,fenls7d,t1_fencrx1,1579287414.0,"Definitely true. Putting Jesus and prayer back in school is such a big issue for them, so now they will be even more inclined to vote for him. Which will probably secure his re-election for next year."
atheism,fen8dnf,t3_eq0r23,1579279210.0,Why is this necessary? No one’s ever said students can’t pray in school. School staff just can’t lead prayer or force anyone to pray. Students can pray all they want.
French,fek5rdj,t3_epkmgb,1579193185.0,Bonne idée ! Merci pour l’avoir partagée !
CatAdvice,fecblnx,t3_eoethn,1578970216.0,"My fiancé and I have two cats and got a 7 week old puppy last year. The cats were scared to death at first but our puppy has never tried to hurt them because he has grown up with them. That’s the reason we got a puppy. Heck, one of my cats will play with him and cuddle with him. The other one is still terrified of him, but she doesn’t like anybody. 

They will get used to a puppy eventually and probably at least tolerate it. If not, you could always try to keep them separate. Our cats and dog are usually separated when they’re in the house because they prefer to stay in their room."

ADTR,fe3bzks,t3_engc57,1578847940.0,Could you tell us the name of the group they posted it in? And seems like the show was kept SUPER secret. I can’t find anything about it either.
atheism,fe1vm0e,t3_enes7d,1578831397.0,Maybe Jesus will become a Marvel superhero like Thor.

cats,fdrxc0e,t1_fdrvsoo,1578691155.0,"I think I have several worse ones than those lol. One of the first cats my family ever had was named Mama Kitty. I was like 7 when we got her. We didn’t know what to call her, so her name was Kitty. Then she got pregnant, so we called her Mama Kitty. I got to name all 5 of her kittens, so I named them Mischief (tortie who was mischievous), Pumpkin Pie (calico who i guess reminded of fall-time, and we still have her at the old age of 16, only wBlackie (black cat if that’s not obvious), Fluffy (fluffy orange and white cat), and the best name of all: Fliffy (almost twin of Fluffy, just short haired). I was very creative as a kid lol."

cats,fdrt21w,t1_fdr62yg,1578689322.0,"Similar story happened to my cousin and I. She got a cat, thought it was a girl and named it Tinkerbell (Tink for short). Cat wandered off and started staying at my house (we live right down the street from each other). Tink started meowing much like a male cat, and I finally got a chance to see Tink’s junk, and turns out she was a male. So we had a male cat named Tinkerbell. My dad wanted to change his name to Tank, but I didn’t like that."
torties,fdqbfg8,t3_emho5m,1578662026.0,I hope she feels better soon!
