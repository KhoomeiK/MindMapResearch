sports,ffsgdc1,t1_ffsdt00,1580181051.0,"Which to me probably means you grew up with a silver spoon in your mouth. most people on this planet grow up under extremely difficult circumstances and have to turn to figures like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and so on to inspire us, teachers about work ethic, goals, and life. this is why they are so important to us. This is why we hold them to a higher standard than an average human being."
sports,ffsg6cv,t1_ffsfoiq,1580180912.0,"Bro you clearly lack empathy and don't fully understand the ramification of the death of such an influential, inspiring, and important human. The REASON why people like kobe had such a wide impact is exactly for things like THIS...it transcends just basketball, they inspires us to be better people, they bond us. 

You don't get it because you're probably too young, but understand you are very wrong and should just leave quietly and try to understand what the loss of someone, that maybe we never knew personally, we still felt like he was a figure in our lives, feels like."
