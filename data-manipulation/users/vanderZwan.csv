evolution,ffhqg20,t1_fffpdks,1579948433.0,"> The way the genome works tends to favor specialization.

A subtly different, complementary take on this is that evolution seems to inherently favor *modularity:*

> *A central biological question is how natural organisms are so evolvable (capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks—their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits—but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.*

https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.2863

The fun part here is that this seems to be an inherent feature of *networks*, so it does not even depend on how the genome works!

We can see that a lot of complex evolution involves the repurposing existing ""modules"" - so much so that I suspect it's a necessity. And modularity leads to easier specialization. So in this light, the arise of certain features seem more inevitable than others, because they are intertwined with modularity.

Taking your examples, the arise of systems biology and a central nervous systems seems to be a logical consequence of modularity to me, but based *purely* on modularity limbs might not be (I'm sure they will be among the features to universally arise for other reasons, but you understand where I'm coming from)."
