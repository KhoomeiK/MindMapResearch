Whether or not you develop speech by or before a certain age is not all autism is, although delayed or regressed verbal communication is usually a sign.

I was diagnosed as I showed difficulty in communication and recognition of emotions, as well as stimming behaviour and hyperfocus. Even though I could speak and read well for my age my ability to actually talk to others was a whole other story, as well as my ability to react appropriately to others emotions.

My mind is perfect. I have an IQ of over 140, an EQ higher than average and an eidetic memory. I’m top of all of my classes. I have to be. Lest my “issues” define me first.

Everyone tells me that if I’m good enough, I can live forever. Even if I’m “like me”. Broken. Disabled. Of course, they don’t use those words. 

My mind is perfect, my body is not. To keep me alive beyond age 30 would likely cost a million dollars more than the average person. And even then, just being average won’t make the cut. I’m surprised I’ve been allowed to live as long as I have. If one’s care costs are more than that person is worth, well, the world stops caring for them, or often even about them. The colder side of me understands that it’s cheaper that way. That some people simply aren’t worth the oxygen and resources that they consume. And I consume more than most. 

I don’t want to die. I have to be worth it. 

Looking through university brochures and course lists remind me of this predicament. I must choose something that is essential, yet doable in a missassembled body. I know my limitations, I learned a long time ago from the stutters of adults whenever I came up with an impossible dream. 

Perhaps I could go into music? Historically people like me are quite the draw for crowds. Yet, eternity as practically a circus attraction doesn’t seem as interesting.

Perhaps engineering? 
That way I’ll leave my mark even if I don’t live long. I have to think of things no one else does. But, that’s the issue. Why design something that only a few would benefit from? Especially when the few usually don’t deserve to even go there. 


Medical? 
Bioinventors are an important of current society, as those that live forever can tell. I’ve worked with a few before, and I like them. In that field I could fix my issues myself, and create things to help people like me. 

But, the things that need to exist won’t happen. Why bother to cure people who aren’t even important enough to live to middle age? Why bother to cure genetic dead ends? If I’m important enough to live, why cannot I live well?

Perhaps everyone is just lying to me. That I’m not going to live long at all. That no matter how good I am someone only half as good as me, but without assistance, is what the world wants. 

I have 19 years to prove them wrong. That’s all the time in the world but no time at all"

The thing is, that you likely wouldn’t have as much control over what therapy and methods  you could do as an ABA tech starring out. There are people in more senior roles that create the programs for the techs, which you will have to follow. 

Also, I think living with your client kinda breaches a lot of rules surrounding patient interactions, and it is not an arrangement that would be comfortable with most therapy companies.
