That aside, I liked DXIW, but they definitely ruined a few aspects of the game.

Although the overall game experience was still good, I liked the Omar, Cairo was an unforgettable game setting, and the black market biomods were pretty neat. Overall still a good game but will forever live in the shadow of the series’ former glory. Unfortunately my xbox crapped out so I can’t play it until I find another one. Poooo :("
Deusex,ffdyejb,t1_ffdxj9r,1579832020.0,"A few things;

First, Everyone has the right to their opinion, not being able to make it through the game is all good. I understand it’s dated.

Second, the stealth is just fine, you’re just a noob at it. XD

Although I’ll admit, the combat is a bit clunky; but at the time,  the game really did push the processing power of your hardware to the limit. Especially the PS2 port. (framerate drops are pretty common with lots of enemies on screen)


Third, Nobody was saying it was the best one in the series. Personally I view Human Revolution as a nearly flawless masterpiece (The atrocious boss battles are my reason for the adjective “nearly” flawless)

Nobody blames you for having a hard time choking down the blessing that is DX1. It’s old. I’m old. The game was revolutionary for me, and many others. It changed the way I played videogames. It taught me to question everything and play games as a pacifist because you never know who is on your side. First time playing DX i nearly cried after killing so many enemies that turned out to be my homies. (No spoilers) 

Much love dead DX homies, my bad.

Game is excellent. But probably not the best in the  series.

Sure, he has a couple duds but honestly his more obscure work has so many diamonds in the rough that he just never ceases to amaze me. 

I reccommend downloading (or buying if you can) entire albums and putting them on shuffle while you clean / do shit around the house

That has always helped me “get into” an artist. Sometime, a song will come on and you’ll stop what you’re doing and just appreciate it. 

But like I said man obviously appreciating DAC isnt a requirement.

slingshots,few2hz5,t3_eqqqd8,1579404568.0,"Honestly man, i find if I concentrate too hard when making a shot, I sometimes overthink it. Shooting a slingshot all comes down to muscle memory eventually. Once you get used tot he feel of a slingshot everying sorta just comes naturally and you will find yourself not really “aiming” at all but just finding the nost confortable “form” and just going with it. As with anything it just takes lots and lots of practice, if you want to do lots of shooting and get good I reccommend making a catchbox so you can retrieve your ammo, glass marbles are great for practice as well as steel ball bearings (3/8”), steel is great because if you plan to do any hunting, you’re already used to the weight and feel of the steel shot from the many hours of practice you put in. Thats basically my advice, don’t overthink the shot and just get in the zone and do what feels comfortable. Your stance and technique appear to be just fine from what I can see in the video, have fun and keep shooting!"

Deusex,fejwfo8,t3_eix5pe,1579187412.0,"Pros and cons of playing all the games in order:

PROS:

-you learn a lot more of the lore and context
-You understand a lot more ingame references
-its an easy transition from old games to new
-you’ll get to experience all augmentations
-you’ll come to appreciate the games advancements over the years
-you’ll have a good idea of how Deus Ex should be played
-You won’t miss out on ANYTHING

CONS:

-There are literally zero cons to playing the games in order. I reccommend it."
Deusex,fejv7yq,t3_eooglw,1579186619.0,"Although, technically, Human Revolution is the first one in the series Chronologically, I would still reccommend playing them in order (DX1, Invisible War, Human Revolution, Mankind Divided)

Reason being is that, although the two newest ones are prequels, you would still be missing out on a lot of the lore and universe context as well as in game references...

Deus Ex 1 is a dated game, no doubt. But if you can just stick with it and force yourself to play through the first bit, there is a lot of fun to be had with it.

It’s the type of game where you’ll find yourself re-loading your game to retry certen levels/areas because you will not be satisfied with how you handled the situation until you get it just perfect. JC Denton is a captivating character and he can be a total badass or modest character depending on how you choose to play.

Deus Ex: Invisible War is pretty controversial because fans didn’t like how some of the RPG elements were stripped away and choices didnt seem as important. But Overall I really liked the game and my only complaint is that Alex D, the main character felt flat and forgettable.

If you can find a copy of DX; The Conspiracy for PS2 I reccommend grabbing it. Maps were a little smaller than the PC version but there were many improvements as well. The PS2 version may be one of the best PC—> PS2 ports ever made. 

Another reason I’m reccommending you play the first two, is because Square Enix totally changed the gameplay. When you play the new ones and then go back you will find yourself having to forget everything you know about the gameplay, and may form some sort of bias towards the classics. Whereas going from the old to new is a relatively smooth transition and the new games are easier to pick up on.

The Deus Ex experience is not something you want to miss out on. Fair warning.

Have fun!"
