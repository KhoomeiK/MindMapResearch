AskReddit,ffcwu0o,t3_esse9d,1579808926.0,"My brother, cousin, and I went to an outdoor shop with my family after eating at a place called “The Roadkill Cafe.” We all had really bad gas from the food and were ripping heinous farts in the aisle with the camping gear. An unsuspecting woman walked into the aisle and started to dry heave at the smells of the farts. The look on her face was like she just found out she’d been poisoned. We got out of there fast, but I’ll never forget her."

battlefield_one,ff3mmkp,t1_ff2wrp9,1579544293.0,"I was playing Operations in Monte Grappa the other day on the attack. We were losing so I switched to my “Field General” Scout (Bi-Pod Sniper with the Trench Periscope). I just followed behind on the mountain side, marked and spotted everyone with the trench periscope and let everyone do the damage as the defenders had no chance running down the mountainside with everyone seeing a red square around them. Then I just easily picked off their Defense snipers and their AA gunners. The AA Gunners sadly moved a lot more then their snipers.

But yeah, playing Sniper in the back doesn’t do your team any good once the objectives start getting captured and there’s no close spawn points."
