I don't have a job atm but I worked at both walmart and a cafe, and at a centre as a general assistant/receptionist helper. I do art now and take care of my dog (chihuahua maltese), and I only had coffee and a single poptart today. I'm still messy and weird and awkward. One day, I will be something...."

Instagramreality,ffa0w6l,t1_ff9vzgd,1579725639.0,"When I was 6, I wanted to be black because I saw beyonce with an afro and I thought she was the most beautiful person I've ever seen and I wanted to look like her. Also I am a pale native and was tired of being made fun of or belittled because I wasn't ""native enough"".

Then things switched in high school and I discovered those ulzzang and kawaii japanese girls and pale living doll girls and wanted to be as pale as I could possibly be, suddenly my ""too white for a native"" skin was ""too ruddy and yellow to be pretty"""
Instagramreality,ffa0qo3,t1_ff9s327,1579725550.0,"Yes omfg. She looks like that bad bitch you always wanted to talk to but were too intimidated by because she's so beautiful. On the right she looks like a cold, mean villainous gold-digging wife, who's husband died of mysterious circumstances. Colorism and internalised racism are the worst."

So if you go slightly just outside of that ledge, like one stroke of lip liner over, it won't be too noticeable. And matte hides it better.

Instagramreality,feo4y9h,t1_feo2mns,1579295161.0,"A little trick if you have hairline thinning or an uneven hairline is to add some eyeshadow similar to your hair colour to the roots/scalp where you want it to look more filled in. It could be that or she could have just gotten her hair dyed recently, like you said."
Instagramreality,feo47ot,t1_feo3wta,1579294933.0,"Well she has admitted to having body dysmorphia, and they all blur their skin for internet. Its not a stretch to assume the reason they can't even have paparazzi pics taken without being edited might be because they are always picking at their flaws. You can be the most beautiful woman alive and you'd still think you have a big nose or a flat ass."
