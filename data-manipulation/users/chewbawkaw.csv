However, I had some concerns regarding your study (as a fellow researcher). Many of the questions you asked were in a yes or no format. For example: is sexting someone outside of the relationship considered cheating: yes or no. The answer for many couples is BOTH yes and no. Like, my partner can sext people we have both agreed upon. He can go to town sexting them. But if he hid someone from me, or was sexting someone we had agreed not to talk to, then yes it would be cheating. The open ended questions were better suited for this issue. 

CNM is so broad. It covers everything from swinging to polyamory to open relationships. Cheating is just going outside of the agreed upon boundaries of a relationship (which varies from relationship to relationship, even in monogamous ones) It would be more conducive to have each participant describe their relationship and boundaries, and THEN ask about cheating and sexting. That way you have more context. It just felt like you were asking binary questions in the hopes of understanding a non-binary topic."

Once upon a decade ago, I cheated on a long term bf. Would I cheat on a partner now? Absolutely not. I am different, my circumstances are different, my partner is different.

Also, I found that finding a different kind of exercise than a standard gym (if you live in a big enough city) is more sustainable.

Im a 5’11” female and have been taller than the majority of men who listed themselves as 6’ on dating apps. I can’t tell you how many dates I’ve been on where the men end up saying a variation of “you can’t be 5’ 11” because I’m 6’ and you’re taller. Take off your shoes and stand back to back with me” ON OUR FIRST DATE! It happens all the time. I don’t even mind dating guys shorter than me, but I hate when guys make non-stop comments about how tall I am or discourage me from wearing heels.

My aunt always wanted a family and had a long term bf until she was about 30. One day he was offered an incredible job in another city and he took it, but my aunt had never lived away from family and did not move with him. My aunt tried to date again but never found anyone else and to this day is still single.

Anyways, in her early 30s she wanted to find a sperm donor to have a baby. Our family convinced her not to because, as far as they were concerned, she was young enough to still meet a man, get married, and have a baby. They also argued that men wouldn’t want to date her if she had a kid. But she never met a man she clicked with and her window to have biological children closed.

In her early 40s she decided that she realllllly wanted a baby, but adoption is ridiculously expensive. She couldn’t afford a baby so she decided to foster to adopt. The 10 yr old boy that arrived had a heartbreaking upbringing and serious PTSD. The behavioral issues are so severe that he is violent and she has to call the police to restrain him in a semi-regular basis. But she loves him. She has always wanted to be a mother and this is her child. She adopted him officially a couple years ago.

The sad thing is that most of our family and her friends have left her because they don’t believe she should have adopted such a violent child. They literally told her that they wouldn’t be friends with her again until she gives the kid up. And because of his issues, dating for her is almost impossible.  I’m proud of her though. She is giving this kid, who would otherwise be in a horrendous situation, love and structure. If she’s happy, then I’m happy for her."

Common sex myths that we are taught and how they can negatively impact our lives. And then also, basic female anatomy.

climbharder,fe8rhyr,t1_fe8o34t,1578929721.0,"Idk, it was at a comp and everyone laid into him pretty badly after that. I didn’t actually know him but needed a belayer since my original partner bailed after I had arrived. If I had a soft catch I would have fallen straight down and then a bit into the wall since it was on an overhang. He didn’t give much slack and instead of moving his body up a bit (he had 60+ lbs on me), he sat down as I fell. I was pumped and fell as soon as my body transitioned fully to the roof. Nothing sketch. But anyways, when he pulled down as I fell I ended up getting pulled into the wall instead of dropping down. He was so much bigger than me that when I fell he had little to no upward momentum at all.

It’s important to know when to use a hard catch vs a soft. I’ve watched people deck on a ledge and break their legs and pelvis because of too soft of a catch. On the flip side, I’ve seen ankle breaks and wrist injuries from slamming into the rock from too hard of a catch. I’m sure the 30cm is fine at a climbing gym but most people eventually find their way outside. It’s good to practice these habits now, instead of brushing it off because of your current climbing grades. Plus injuries can happen on a 5.7 (sometimes more because they tend to be blockier) too. I think my injury was on an indoor 10b."
climbergirls,fe8l799,t1_fe7wzn1,1578927428.0,"I have a couple tips and tricks since I started climbing in my late 20s and travel for work a lot:

1) you could listen to a playlist of your favorite songs while you boulder (but then you may miss out on possible friendships because you’re tuning everything out)

2) If the gym is packed I will often find another solo person who is working on the same project as me and will chat with them about the problem. I’ve met a lot of good friends this way.

3) If I am on an autobelay, I will find another autobelayer and ask if they want to partner up for the day. 

4) if I’m struggling with beta, I might ask a better climber to show me how to do a problem. I’ve met some cool people this way and people love showing off their sweet skills. 

5) I sign up for a yoga classes at the climbing gym when I’m traveling and then I boulder as a warm up. Sometimes, knowing that there is a set end time for climbing is nice while alone. 

6) I’m pretty chatty and typically will talk to the staff and anyone else who looks like they are solo too. The beautiful thing about climbers is that you can make best friends with someone and never learn their last name. Climbers will talk about climbing until they are blue in the face. How long have you been climbing? Do you climb outside? Where is the coolest place you have climbed? What do you think are the best aggressive climbing shoe for narrow feet? Have you tried out the new [insert gear here]? Have you seen how small the gear loops are on the [insert harness here]? It can go on, and on, and on. 

7) It’s also good to remember that no one cares how good or bad you are. Even if you’re flashing V11s in the gym, people might look for a half second and then get back to whatever problem they are working on. Have fun. Remember that you enjoy this sport and are doing it for you, not to impress strangers. 


New gyms are cool because you will typically experience completely different styles of climbing. Some gyms I will try out and get shut down immediately on “easy” stuff. Other gyms can make me feel like the best climber in the entire state and I’ve even been invited to join climbing teams. My friends and I joke that I should pick up a side gig as a climbing gym reviewer since I go to 3-4 different gyms a month.

The best part about it though, is that climbers are the friendliest group of humans I’ve ever met. Yeah, you have the occasional asshole here and there, but generally they are pretty inclusive.  Thanks to climbing I now have friends in each city I go to."

I had to sit him down and talk about how it isn’t respectful. Me playing on my computer is doing important data analysis for cancer research and that I would never minimize his career.

Your hands are sensitive. They aren’t covered by anything so once they are on a good hold they will stay put when you look away. 

Your toes are covered by rubber so you don’t have as much sensory input. Often when you look away they shift and move. Watching your feet as you place them on a foothold helps build technique and doesn’t wear out your shoes as fast (from fumbling around and kicking the wall). Also, moving your feet up as much as possible when you have good hand holds.

I started to accept that it was normal to gain 5-10 lbs every year or so until you die. Some mild depression didn’t help either.  And then I was dumped. Right before we were going to get married. My body under stress doesn’t process food well so that helped the weight loss initially. But I took this opportunity to snap myself out of the delusional fog I was in. I started exercising and went right back to my former 145lb self. 

I found forms of exercise that were sustainable. Not everyone is made to be a gym rat. Not everyone finds lifting weights enjoyable. If your sister doesn’t like it she probably won’t keep up with it. I chose community based exercise. Yoga classes, hiking groups, rock climbing, ballet and dance. Instead of going to the bar to drink and watch the football game, I watched it while walking on the treadmill. I find ways to stay engaged while moving. The nice thing about group exercise is that you meet people who are also super active. Most of my friends I met at the climbing gym. Instead of going to the bars on Friday night we share some whiskey at the top of a mountain. I have a beer after kayaking with my rafting groups. In my current relationship (who I also met through climbing) we now both prioritize fitness. Our date nights don’t involve fancy dinners or restaurants or Netflix binges. We may eat a simple, healthy meal and then we go do something active. We have traveled all over for hiking, climbing, kayaking, skiing, ice climbing. I have more energy now then I did at 20!

But it’s a total change in mindset. And a huuuuge lifestyle change. You have to push through a lot of uncomfortable feelings at first because when you are overweight exercising can be awful. Everything hurts, you can’t breathe, the people around you all feel especially bad ass. Your body is screaming at you to stop and it’s hard to remember that the pain will get better. Getting over that hump is the hardest part. I initially made smaller changes eating because I couldn’t do both at the same time. I think some people try to do too much all at once then get discouraged and hangry. It takes a lot of will power and stubbornness to change 10 years of bad habits. If you are depressed, stressed, have no free time, lots of kids with no childcare, have medical issues, an unsupportive partner, have no money for healthy meals or memberships to fitness centers, lack of transportation, live somewhere that doesn’t value health, etc. it can be even harder to change.

I tried to make it fun and keep it simple. I made a series of small changes that eventually changed the trajectory of my life. The initial process sucked monkey balls."

AskWomen,fcvbg0j,t1_fcux3lv,1577998591.0,"I’m a biracial woman. It’s kind of neat, I can look totally white in the winter and look completely black in the summer. I’m like a color changing spoon! :) I’ve learned to love and embrace who I am. 

But people will probably keep commenting about her skin if she’s light. You can’t control what others will say or think. I can’t tell you how many times white people have put their arm next to mine in the winter and commented that I can’t possibly be black because they are darker than me. I’ve had people make fun of my textured hair and features. Hell, I got a nasty comment on my hair yesterday! I was once called the spawn of Satan for being mixed, and that wasn’t even the worst of the name calling. But I feel that it’s getting better as more kids are born from interracial relationships. 

But Honestly, one of the biggest things my parents didn’t even think to prepare me for (and keep in mind this just my personal experience) is that when white people think you’re white, they sometimes turn off their racism filter. And almost everyone seems to have a racism filter. But when I look black, the negative comments can be baaaaad but they are mostly just from openly, racist people. But not everyone is openly racist, most people seem to at least try to hold it together.  90% of the time I called home crying in college was because of horrendous things people had said when they thought there were no black people around. My friends, coworkers, teachers, you name it. My parents struggled to lift me up through those moments. 

You sound like you are doing a wonderful job empowering your daughter. You sound open and compassionate. Surrounding her with a mix of cultures and a community that loves her for who she is will allow her to feel beautiful inside and out :)"
AskWomen,fcv7msc,t1_fcuxuol,1577996331.0,"I totally agree that some mixed kids will prop themselves up at the expense of others. And I’m totally with you in that no one should be putting down anyone of any color. But I think it’s born out of a desire for culture and appreciation and self love. 

 African Americans are still fighting for their place. Trying to create to create a unique culture that is recognized in society. Slavery took away our African Culture. My Irish side can trace our family back to one village in N. Ireland. How cool is that? But my last name is still our plantation name. My family history starts in Texas in 1865. My grandpa grew up around freed slaves. His great uncles fought for the Union. He himself wasn’t allowed in restaurants and bars and pools. My father was the first black child in his middle school and he walked through angry picket lines every morning. I’ve watched men literally spit on him for the color of his skin. I grew up listening to their stories. I’m part of the first generation in my family that hasn’t been completely shit on. We’ve worked tirelessly (literally blood, sweat, and tears) for like 5 generations so that I can find a home in my blackness. So that we can proud of our black culture. 

Buuuuuut I’m not just black. My parents met at a city dance in the 80s and fell deeply, deeeeeply, head over heels,  grossly in love. Yes, there were other black women he could have chosen. And yes, there were other white men that she could have chosen. But hot damn, sometimes you don’t get to choose who you find yourself attracted to. They didn’t see skin color, they just saw each other. And when my mom got pregnant, complete strangers, both black and white, would come up to her and tell her to abort me. Because what quality of life could a mixed child possibly have in this country?

At least in my experience (and maybe not every biracial kid feels this) I’ve been pulled in two directions. And I’ve grown up being told I’m either black OR white. Not both. There wasn’t even a mixed box, or check all that apply option, on medical forms until fairly recently. I even had a couple in a mall tell me I was the spawn of Satan for being biracial. It can be hard to feel like you truly belong anywhere. The black community doesn’t always accept mixed kids. They have fought so hard for their own culture that sometimes I feel like I’m not accepted unless I hush up my white side. And the black culture can be elitist as well! People will prop themselves up because their skin is the darkest at the expense of lighter skinned African Americans (and vice versa). And I just confuse the hell out of my white friends and family.

But as attitudes change towards interracial relationships, there is now a growing subculture of kids who don’t fit in any box. I went to a black lives matter rally and people didn’t know whether to march with me or yell at me, lol. And like with any group struggling to find their voice and demonstrate pride in themselves, it can sometimes come across as a holier than thou attitude. But it’s just a cry for acceptance. Idk. everyone, regardless of skin color,  just wants to be loved and celebrated for who they are."
AskWomen,fcuwhss,t1_fcukjyq,1577989944.0,"I’m a biracial lady as well and I sometimes feel that it puts a whole other level of complication on self-love. 

My parents are wonderful but had a hard time relating to some of my struggles as a mixed kid. I think they felt helpless. I remember my mom struggling with my hair every morning too. The more she would brush it, the bigger and more unruly it became. She is one of those white ladies who takes a shower and doesn’t even have to brush it. It dries perfect and straight, it’s super soft and a gorgeous shade of dark red. My black friends/family would make fun of me for being white. My white friends/family would make fun of me for being black. I didn’t really feel like I belonged anywhere and that’s hard as a teenager and young adult. People would put me in whatever binary box made them feel most comfortable, but then I wasn’t comfortable. How am I supposed to embrace and love my whole self if I’m constantly embarrassed and told to deny half of who I am!? You shouldn’t have to pick sides when it comes to who you are. I was a confused kid for sure and I felt like an ugly duckling. 

I ended up following (on social media) and hanging out with other mixed women starting in college and that has helped my self-esteem so much! My group is such a rainbow of color and culture! Since phenotypes don’t always match genotypes, its nice to surround ourselves with people who not only accept, but appreciate, whatever mix of features we ended up with. In my case, it has allowed me to be proud of being both Irish and West African. We live in two separate worlds and it’s wonderful to be around others who understand what that’s like. We often joke that WE are the dream and everyone else is just jealous. 

My mixed friends also helped me figure out what to do with my hair because it is like 3 different textures and has a mind of its own :)"

SaltLakeCity,fc30upp,t3_efx7ml,1577378890.0,"Hey! I just learned to ski too (in my 30s!!!) and might be able to help! Definitely check out adult learning packages at the resorts, these include rentals, a lesson, and typically a lift ticket. Often you can get a “learn in 3” deal where if you aren’t comfortable on the green runs by your third lesson you can keep coming back for free until you graduate.


Other things that are helpful as an adult beginner: 

Rentals only include skis, poles, and boots so you will need to purchase gloves, goggles, and a helmet or borrow these items from a friend. Make sure you have ski pants and a jacket. When I was learning I saw many other adult beginners in jeans. You will be miserable. Salt Lake City has a number of used gear shops (like The Gear Room) where you can by second hand ski clothing and gear.

Some resorts have a free mountain tour and will break skiers up by ability level and a volunteer will show you around the resort. They can’t “teach” you how to ski but they will wait for you to catch up, you learn fun facts, and it’s a good way to push yourself. It’s also a nice way to meet other people at your level. 

Make a happy playlist on your phone to listen to while you practice solo after the lesson (only use one headphone so you can hear the people around you). There will be times where you are feeling discouraged, a happy playlist helps you stay relaxed and upbeat. 

Once you have mastered the magic carpet, don’t be afraid to ask the staff which green runs are the easiest/beginner friendly. 

It’s ok if you can’t keep up with your friends and learning as an adult can be lonely. My friends would ski the first run of the day with me and then their last few runs of the day with me. Then we would all grab a beer together. Other than that I was alone and relied on my happy playlist and sheer stubbornness to get through my day. Making friends with other adult beginners on the lifts is recommended. 

Don’t give up! The more runs you do/ the longer you stay on the mountain = the better you will get! 

Have fun!!! Skiing is so much fun once you can turn both left AND right!!!!"
