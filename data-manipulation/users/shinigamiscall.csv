gaming,fejl6em,t3_eph35z,1579178620.0,But what about the super ultimate deluxe edition for just $199.99 that includes the first season of dlc? ^^^in-game ^^^purchases ^^^not ^^^included

Showerthoughts,fejiosm,t3_epa6g4,1579175960.0,Pretty sure a lot of that actually came from people (kids) being raised with things like gaming addiction and social media. More kids chose to stay inside and exclude themselves from the goings-on of the world. Hard to develop proper social skills if you don't publicly socialize outside of with your immediate family on occasion.

gaming,fegjnbv,t1_fegjbgi,1579094796.0,I only experienced it at the end of the game. Literally 20min from the end. First character too. Felt great...
aww,fegjcir,t3_ep0d7i,1579094545.0,"Tsundere dad at it again. 

Dad: No, we aren't getting a cat and that's final!

Family: **brings cat home anyway**

Dad: **Proceeds to play with the cat and realizes he has been caught.** ""It's not like I wanted a cat or anything..."" ^^^baka"
gaming,fegj0iv,t3_eoz6n0,1579094258.0,"Reminds me of borderlands 3... The bug where if you get ahead of the NPC then you brick your character because you can't advance due to the NPC not progressing dialogue for you to do the next step. So, to avoid this you have to stay well behind the NPCs."
AskReddit,fegi1j6,t3_eoz249,1579093413.0,"Reincarnation. We won't be the us that we are now as all that is attached to our body (cells, neurons, experiences etc) However, the energy has to go somewhere. We exist now and if energy can't be created nor destroyed then eventually we end up within another vessel, just as different entities from before. Doomed to endlessly repeat the cycle of life and death until the universe ends and begins anew back to square one."
borderlands3,fdwr0y9,t3_em4dzy,1578761484.0,"Let's be honest here. They only nerfed shit to incentivize people to buy the dlc. That's why they put OP gear in it. It's disgusting but it works. Unfortunately, people also don't tend to like nerfs in a non-competitive game. So a lot of players either up and left or simply don't go online. The battlepass is there to milk any other suckers still willing to pay them more money."
manga,fdq01i4,t1_fdpyvmg,1578648146.0,Not sure if it's tagged into it but there are definitely a number of grotesque parts and details in the novel. Not sure how much will be shown though. We do get a lengthy break after this tutorial area with a lengthy training arc.
manga,fdpwzqo,t1_fdp3s6o,1578644031.0,"From what I recall it was derogatory naming in his manga that was considered racist. At least, that's what I seem to recall. Some people also took issue with the fact that it glorified their war crimes since he was reincarnated into a good life because he was a monster on the battlefield. His defense was that he was half Chinese but that didn't seem to change anything. Don't recall anything else other than that other than this promoting his editor/publisher to drop him."
manga,fdpwe6y,t1_fdnsyd2,1578643287.0,I see you don't visit the horror genre of manga too much. It's not that uncommon for kids in the horror genre to die or meet some twisted fate.
manga,fdptcpw,t1_fdoohh4,1578639691.0,Not really an isekai. Just a reincarnation/time travel which is extremely common in wuxia. It's already confirmed he went back in time and was reincarnated there rather than to another world. That's why the cave was there and how he knew where it was.
manga,fdn6kur,t1_fdn4ql5,1578578686.0,"From what I recall of it, yes. I started reading it when the raws for the manga first came out and my memory isn't perfect but I distinctly recall her not naturally falling for him and it instead being because of a type of contract. Which is why I was surprised because this sub tends to hate slave isekai and that's effectively what this is. He treats her well but her thoughts and feelings weren't her own."
manga,fdn3eb7,t1_fdlm3ls,1578576112.0,"As I recall she only fell for him after some type of contract that changed the way she thought/felt. She was going to use it to turn him into a slave or some such but it backfired. So their ""relationship"" isn't mutual by choice. Then the story, majority of characters, war, power scaling and world building are all afterthoughts to the slice of life the mc wants to live with his waifu. :/"
manga,fdn2wyp,t1_fdlir0q,1578575693.0,It's not too far from it. It's another slice of life wannabe isekai with terrible plot progression and power scaling. Unlike most isekai the world building in this is an afterthought and most of the characters are bland/forgettable.
manga,fdkor1e,t1_fdkmerg,1578507998.0,"I mean, that's part of how brainwashing works. It's just that the difference is in if one changes as a result. He undergoes significant changes in his thought process thanks to her guidance which is why it's not just manipulation but brainwashing."

manga,fdjrim3,t1_fdjr8ee,1578484788.0,Not sure if it was in the wn or not but it was after his first meeting with the people that would be helping him. After that he and the princess went to the room and that's when she convinced him to continue using it.
manga,fdjplwp,t1_fdjcp9t,1578482411.0,"This isn't really a spoiler since it was just cut content.

There's a lot missing here but he is only doing this because he was brainwashed (not with a spell) by the princess. When he first used it he hated it and felt it was wrong. He didn't even want to use it. The princess convinced him it was for the greater good through clever wordplay. 

On the flip side there's Hibiki. Not going to say anything about it but let's just say she doesn't find what she does wrong... ever."
manga,fdjpe60,t1_fdjonjr,1578482125.0,"Something like that. A bit more to it. Especially, when you start seeing her thought process about Makoto later on. Think of her as the controlling type and that which she feels she can't control well..."

comics,fdjodyj,t3_elfcvj,1578480753.0,"Fortunately, most people tend to think more about their own embarrassing moments rather than the one you did. Probably something to do with the hippocampus forcing you to remember things that had a bigger emotional impact on you and for most it's their own experiences rather than others."
manga,fdgod1w,t1_fdf3tk7,1578403914.0,"It's probably due more with the fact that they were expanding the world rapidly early on. Now that has come to a virtual standstill and it feels less ""alive"" than before. This is why a lot of manga, novels etc will hop to different perspectives. However, it's been a while now since we have hoped to the perspective of someone doing something on a large scale. It's small fights, background stories and scenes more akin to slice of life. He also jumped through levels rapidly and we could see his growth. Now... Well, the pacing has slowed down considerably.

I dropped Red Storm because of the whole chakra, ki, chi etc. becoming something everyone and their mother had. At first only a few had it then suddenly everyone had it and it was a constant back and forth from there with the mc being strong, weak or dead even with his opponent given the scenario because plot."
manga,fdgm1mn,t3_el66w1,1578401861.0,"Having started the novel a few days ago and now being 106 chapters in I can definitely say this is a series worth reading. It has it's cliches, badass moments, wtf moments and some pretty good characters. (A number of waifu worthy characters too) It will definitely take a long while to get to them but if you don't mind the pacing as it is now then you should be fine."
manga,fcwxdsb,t1_fcvbpic,1578041688.0,"Pretty sure we don't see much of anything in either thanks to censorship laws. Haha

The difference is just that one uses sex/sexual innuendos for comedic effect while the other does it to be erotic. Ecchi only becomes erotic when paired with smut/senien but those aren't too common and it's instead normally paired with shounen/harem."
AskReddit,fbwcutx,t1_fbvci7g,1577146574.0,"Uh, I specifically remember e3 that year. The whole Xbox one always online, no game sharing with friends, cable box console. Definitely not their best year."
