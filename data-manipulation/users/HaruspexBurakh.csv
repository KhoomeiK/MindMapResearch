Favorite game I’ve been given? Recently, that goes to Among The Sleep by u/ABirdOfParadise the other day here.

Game I want is Prey for 7.49: https://store.steampowered.com/sub/107520/

Or, if allowed multiple games that add up to 20, I would instead love Bioshock Infinite Season Pass and Bioshock 2 remastered, equaling 14.98: https://store.steampowered.com/app/409720/BioShock_2_Remastered/ https://store.steampowered.com/app/214933/BioShock_Infinite__Season_Pass/
