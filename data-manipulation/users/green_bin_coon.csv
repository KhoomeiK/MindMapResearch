On heavy used passenger corridors you wont find any one, because its easy to get caught, you have to keep moving or you get kicked out. On freight corridors its a lot of encampments, double so in more secluded areas.

They fact your walking around homeless camps means you will be dealing with a lot of unstable people, living on the street messes you up a lot (as my university is located near the Mecca for toronto homelessness i see a bunch).
