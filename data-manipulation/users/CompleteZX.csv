This game is no longer worth my money. I can't believe they're releasing players for $75 while the game is in this state.

nfl,fdg12mz,t1_fdfsy31,1578376161.0,"While the passing game has become more important, league scoring averages have stayed roughly the same since the 1950s. Recently the numbers have gone up slightly, but it's not a huge difference. ""modern NFL heavily favors offense"" is a myth. The modern NFL favors passing, not offense.

Teams are putting up more yards per game through throwing the ball a lot more, but since passing is inconsistent, that hasn't translated to the average game being much higher scoring.

My point is that modern NFL quarterbacks are actually shouldering (pun intended) a higher percentage of the team's offensive load, which makes them even more important than in the past, which is part of why I think Brady's success is so impressive. He's a pure passer and lacks top level athleticism in pretty much every other way. He can't bail himself out with his legs often because he's even slower than most of his linemen.

It's so incredible to me because they've lasted so long it isn't just good luck or a fluke. They have just been run so well as an organization, and mostly by one man.

Michel doesn't seem to be a game changing back either.
