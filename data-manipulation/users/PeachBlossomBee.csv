I play pumped up really fun music (usually not even in English) and I sing along or headbang and generally have fun, so my shower isn’t as tedious and I have a consistent sense of time (ex. “That song is about 3 or 4 mins and the last one was 5, so I’ve spent about 8 or 9 mins at most.”) 

I know sometimes you can’t be bothered or are too tired, so **Double Life Hack**: wash your neck and wrists (scent circulates there, which is why you spray perfume on those spots), your armpits, your butt, and your crotch (generally dirtiest spots/has most bacteria). Don’t make this a habit though!


Additionally, if you get some Stridex Red Pads ($5) swipe one or two in your armpits post-shower. The salicylic acid in them will kill off the bad-scent producing bacteria. ***And don’t forget deodorant!***"

AskReddit,fd3p0qc,t1_fd2tmqs,1578160462.0,"I live there. Grain of salt, as I don’t go places, but here’s my experience:

Most of Manhattan is good to live in if you can shit money, Harlem being the exception. It’s also where most of the cool stuff is, so there’s that. I’ve actually never done most of the touristy shit, because I hate tourists: they can’t *fucking* walk, they don’t *move out the *fucking* way*, and they just mess up the vibe. Whatever you do, please don’t stop the movement.

Some fave places: Union Sq has a bunch of shops and a farmer’s market, going straight down 14th has all the food. 

Other parts like SoHo have frequent pop up shops, clothing stores I could never afford, etc. 

Afaik, Staten Island is super white and Republican, so I’ve never set foot in it. The Bronx has few attractions (Bronx Zoo, Botanical Gardens), but it’s the most affordable (aside from Riverdale. Also don’t go to the south part, there’s gangs). It’s a “people you wanna see” experience rather than “places you wanna go”. Spent least time in Brooklyn and Queens, so can’t speak on them. Went to a space center once, had fun. 

There’s nerd conventions like comicon or cosplay stuff every once in a while. Cool comic book shops n there’s often speaker events at the 92nd st Y. 

The subway is fine, but there’s definitely not enough funding. Like, I’m grateful it’s there but trains are coming later and later. Wildest shit happens every day. Once saw someone convince a guy not to jump in front of the train because of how it would inconvenience others, and then the guy became friends with a conspiracy theory hotep and sat on the train like nothing happened. 

Related note: New Yorkers do not give a shit about you or anything you do, they will avoid eye contact like a mf. So you’re never the weirdest person there! ...But you do have to learn to ignore all the crazy people. 

If a train car is empty, be suspicious. Don’t sit or stand on them wet looking spots if possible. You *will* be stuck underground at some point, but it’s fine. All the subway stops sound different if you listen well enough. Don’t pull the red thing, I don’t even know why it’s there; it would only make stuff worse. Standard public transportation rule, bring headphones in case of screaming baby or person you reeeeaaaalllly wanna ignore. 

Street performers are cool. You see them all the time. Support, esp. if you take video. The train car performers vary in quality, but few watch anyway. There’s always a next time. Same goes for the homeless (minus video taking). 

I think that’s about it, unless i forgot smth.

Edit: There’s some *sick* fucking dumplings at 42 Mulberry Street. 5 for 1.25. Best shit EVER. Other parts of menu meh tho

Edit 2: In terms of wealth n affordability, I actually found some stats recently. They’re from 2013, but still pretty indicative. It goes Manhattan wealthiest, median household income solidly over 100k (except Harlem) followed by Staten Island, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx poorest. I think there’s a solid Asian population in Queens, while the Bronx is solidly black and hispanic. Manhattan and Staten Island mostly white. I don’t know if that’s helpful, but hey.

Edit 3: Halloween Parade! Famous. Never been."

If you’re arguing about issues that directly affect you and those you care about (for example: mass incarceration, economic policies, gender pay gap, general civil rights might come to mind) you’re gonna get pissed really quickly. 

Civil debate shouldn’t be expected if *you’re* the person who has to deal with whatever the outcome of those policies actually are. Then it’s not just an impersonal thought exercise, it has real and serious consequences.

Self care. Find a hobby that allows you to connect with yourself. Journaling, taking walks, reading or writing stories, or literal self care like pampering yourself/skin care are all good options. Checking in with how you feel without judgement, getting used to being able to look at your reflection without deriding it, or creating something entirely new is really important for mental health. Art, woodworking, sewing/embroidery, making things or props out of various materials, collages etc are all good avenues.

Go outside. Connect with people. Just sit in a park or a library or a cafe. Feeling the presence of Things and Other People besides yourself are really important and tend to be overlooked. Don’t push yourself to interact unless you feel ready.

Talk to yourself like you would a loved one or small child. I always end up in spiraling loops of insulting myself and really harsh words—things I would never say to a stranger, much less someone I cared about. If I’m struggling, I write encouraging notes with lots of smileys and silly doodles, or I say things out loud, like “It’s okay that you’re struggling PeachBlossomBee, but we can do this. Let’s try again” or “You did really well on this part! I’m very proud of you.” It feels a little silky at first, but saying positive things in an external voice helps me say them in an internal voice.

Find others with your interests. Reddit is a good place for this actually; if you’re into films or something there’s plenty of places right here. I believe r/findasubreddit helps with searching.

And above all else, practice self-forgiveness. We can’t grow and evolve without making mistakes, or accepting that we aren’t always in control of what happens to us. Shit happens, and sometimes it’s our fault, and sometimes it’s not. Please remember that as long as you’re making an effort to be better, you’re already halfway there.
