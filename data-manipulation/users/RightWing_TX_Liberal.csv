Arkansas,ff2iefw,t1_ff1c27r,1579507489.0,"Honestly I feel like I could sit down and have a civil conversation with you and we would both leave a little wiser. I have no ill will and want things as fair as possible for every human being. I'm 100% positive there is a middle ground however I feel the way I do from my experiences, just as you do. 

I've rented several properties between 2008 and 2016. I'd find a place, get orders, move out, deploy, come home, find another place, deploy and so on. 16 addresses in 10 years, then in 2016 I bought a house and lived there until 1 month ago. 

For 2 years now, I've been a civilian and have lost rights afforded to military families in breaking leases, having background checks waived, security deposits waived and so on. 

This last month has been a massive eye opener.  Tenets rights have ruined the market for rentals.  It's so much of a risk and takes up so much time it's not worth a landlord renting a home out. It's easier and unfortunately a better idea to hire a company to do it. The companies now get to bleed both parties dry and are professionals at writing contracts that make tenants responsible for anything and everything that happens. So any law that was written to protect a tenant is now null and void by most lengthy contracts. I passed on 2 properties after paying the 190 back ground fee each time after I read the contract. That's $380 I threw away just to see a contract. One contract read, ""Responsible for any repairs under 1000 dollars"". In what world would anyone agree to that? People who dont have a choice and just need a place to live.. That is just 1 example from 20+ pages. Sad part is, I make good money and don't have kids so I do have options. However still, I'm renting Well below my means because I still have a mortgage to pay in Arkansas.  If Texas had similar rights as Arkansas landlords do, it wouldn't be so hard for families to move around and put themselves in better situations. 

I understand this is just my experience and other's experiences may vary. This is just my long drawn out 2 cents.


TLDR: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Giving tenants rights will only harden the company's that rent, making longer contracts and ultimately pushing responsiblity onto the tenants all while raising rent."
Arkansas,ff0asyj,t1_fezp3gp,1579466977.0,"Not true. 

The Rental Unit Is Unsafe or Violates Arkansas Health or Safety Codes

If your landlord does not provide habitable housing under local and state housing codes, a court would probably conclude that you have been “constructively evicted;” this means that the landlord, by supplying unlivable housing, has for all practical purposes “evicted” you, so you have no further responsibility for the rent. The problem must be truly serious, such as the lack of heat or other essential service."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fd7hrsh,t1_fd75y9m,1578204724.0,"I disagree with a lot of what you're saying because most of it is speculative and also sounds like repetitive talking points that are meant to scare people. Rationing beds and equipment? Reminds me of the death panel b.s. fox was trying to push. 

Tricare is government healthcare, it's already a thing.  it has its pros and cons. But not having enough hospital beds and letting people die because they can't be seen just isn't one.

We can literally drive into a country that has a working model of universal healthcare. Making it sound impossible or too expensive is starting to sound silly. It's not far fetched. You can also look backwards in time before big pharma and see most health services were free and supplied and funded by the church. 

You used the word scarcity to describe supply and demand. That stays the same no matter what. 320 million people need healthcare today, 320 million will need it tomorrow no matter where it comes from. Again you can hide costs from consumers, but you can't from the government. Again, Tricare. 

The government not having competition? How do you think government works? The government lists jobs or needed supplies. Then companies compete for the contract. That is competition. But just to pretend that it's not, having a supplemental insurance solves that non issue. 

Lastly the private insurance companies work in tandem, like OPEC. They all agree on how much to charge. So either way the government has to step in, one way or another. There is nothing we as consumers, can do to gain power enough to make a change."

When I was apart of Honor Gaurd, we'd do our absolute best to get a perfect fold or close to it. But sometimes you work with what you have, not all flags are created equal. Worst case scenario, after I would present the flag and salute, if I knew the flag could be better. I would reach out to the funeral director and request the flag back to be refolded. They are meant to be honored and displayed just as you're doing here. 

Unless you can see red at the top, your flag isn't bad. (Red rockets get rejected and re-folded during the ceremony.) But in that beautiful display, the flag should match your craftsmanship and more importantly your Grandpa's service."

Upper class gets taxed more than middle class by a lot, 24% 260,000 in the US vs 45% Germany. You have to clear 612,000 just to be taxed at 37% in the US.

And maybe, if you cut the budget to 0 it still wouldn't be enough to cover it. But you're excluding equity, if you liquidated our 2nd to none military you'd have enough to fund free healthcare for years. Not saying we should have a fire sale! Just pointing out Rome wasn't built in a day.
