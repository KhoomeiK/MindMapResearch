Anyway- Thanks for being a good sport. I always hesitate to correct someone- pisses some people off unnecessarily- but I myself love learning new stuff."
facepalm,fg6y96z,t3_ex9lo2,1580579660.0,"Stowage is actually a word- where something is “stowed” until later; it’s not just “stored” to be kept. Mostly a term used in the navy, though. 

The difference: 

“Storage is the act of placing material or ammunition and other supplies onboard. Stowage relates to the act of securing those items stored in such a manner that they do not shift or move during transit, using methods and equipment as approved by higher authority.” 

But your post still made me laugh. 
Especially the lisp comment."

facepalm,fg5op8s,t3_ex0bkq,1580533532.0,Charming.
HealthInsurance,fg3f2kh,t1_fg2vecc,1580479880.0,That’s good then- that they called it a qualifying event. I’m sorry this happened to you. Hope you find something decent soon.
HealthInsurance,fg2ui0t,t3_ewkuc4,1580456444.0,"There’s almost nothing you can do except private insurance options, since both your work insurance and the Obamacare healthcare online program have closed their enrollments now. Call around and speak to private insurance companies in your area tomorrow and get their health insurance options and rates. Call several places. It’s going to be expensive- I’m sorry- but you’ll probably have to do it if you wish to be insured. Get several several quotes and listen to their advice. 

Read the fine print for insurance at your HR, too, for ‘other qualifying exemptions’.  That is your only loophole, and it’s not likely."
BetterEveryLoop,fg2bymh,t3_ewhzew,1580442143.0,And Enthrallingly odd.
malelivingspace,fg2birb,t3_ewi58q,1580441924.0,It’s wonderful!

-just seems like an unusually cruel fate."
LifeProTips,fg1oat6,t1_fg1o5lh,1580430741.0,"Excellent!! 
(Oh -Wait. Fml- I still need the companion???)"
LifeProTips,fg1o1jv,t1_fg1nv90,1580430599.0,"Oh my word! I think you’ve hit on it. Nice job. 
I am, sadly then, still total bear bait.
(But perhaps the severe depression emanating off of me is similar to the hunting sprays I’ve hear of?? )"
