ChoosingBeggars,ffb2tvi,t1_ffa4uue,1579750371.0,It’s a shame this is all fake. Look at how many other posts they’ve made.
politics,ffacjrz,t1_ffacbm8,1579732337.0,It’s also disgusting how some Americans mock the French military considering the fact that our independence was in no small part made possible because of French assistance.
AmItheAsshole,ff98y2p,t1_ff92p73,1579707576.0,"Poison her with breadcrumbs? Try reading the entire post. There are no actual peanuts involved, just the threat of peanuts (which are actually bread crumbs since OP doesn’t want to actually hurt the kid) to keep her thieving hands off of the pretzels."
The_Mueller,ff8umoy,t1_ff8oire,1579696655.0,"Yeah sadly he’s just so far on the left that many of the older Dems are not interested in having him win. I know people who believe he will essentially raid retirement accounts in order to forgive student  debt for people who chose to get a useless degree from an expensive college while using some of the loan money to take extravagant spring break vacations or to “study” abroad. They believe that taxpayers shouldn’t be footing that bill, and won’t vote for him."
AmItheAsshole,ff33dzk,t1_ff2zeaz,1579532646.0,Pretty sure attempting blackmail isn’t the answer here. They’re not going to respond positively to that and it could put OP in a terrible position legally speaking.
