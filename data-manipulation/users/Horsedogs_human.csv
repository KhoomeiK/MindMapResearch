reactivedogs,ffgrzkd,t3_et960s,1579913555.0,"Do you feed in a bowl?  
If so try scatter feeding if your feeding dry food, or using a stuffed kong to feed wet food.  Also exclude all the other animals from where your dog is eating.   
And vet check to make sure there is nothing else going on in his mouth."
Dogtraining,ffg4r06,t3_etd6fc,1579898432.0,"Can you put up a baby gate?  At the moment every time you come in, you are reinforcing the behaviour you don't want.    


You can do the tape exercise above, but you're best to make sure that he can't get the reinforcement of from being there at the gate - it's an incredibly reinforcing.  If this has been going on for a number of years, it can take a very long time to change this behaviour.   Management of the environment (by preventing access to the gate) is a really good step along with training an alternative behaviour."

reactivedogs,ffb7vja,t1_ffapdj6,1579754360.0,"Actually it does work. 

My dog got like that after being attacked and us being told to use a choke chain on him. 

I had to stand far enough away from the other dog that he didn't go nuts then reward him being able to calmly look at the other dog or do a command. Then we moved closer. And repeated. 

It takes time, space and a lot more effort from both you and the trainer than slapping on a shock collar."
reactivedogs,ff9tjb8,t1_ff9nuh7,1579720943.0,It sounds like you had some bad training advice. If you wish to keep working with your dog you should try to find a rewards based trainer and ideally a behaviourist.
reactivedogs,ff9tbbr,t3_esb3ws,1579720804.0,Please see a veterinary behaviourist. It is possible that your dog would benefit from medication to decrease his anxiety levels.
reactivedogs,fezt6fd,t1_feyplvs,1579461330.0,"Also keep your muzzle on your body at all times.  Is this means you need to get a training vet or skirt, do so.  Or a treat bag with a belt that you can put a loop on to attach your muzzle too.  Just don't put yourself in a position to be away from your gear."

Also you need to decide if the club is the right one for you and your dog, their more advanced classes could be just as chaotic."

reactivedogs,fehcp7t,t1_feh7qlr,1579113847.0,"If you are in the UK look at neewa or dogfit. 
For the rest of the world, howling dog alaska, mountain dog, manmat and zerodc do good belts that are not always as expensive."
reactivedogs,feh6r86,t1_fegqggi,1579110316.0,"Rather than 2 flimsy belts, look into canicross belts - they're designed for dogs to pull hard against.  they're also really nice and wide so they protect your back if your dog lunges."

dogs,fecvdsv,t3_eoglcy,1578986130.0,"If he is refusing food then he's feeling really crap.    
Any time a dog refuses food  for days and is losing weight it's really bad especially if he's drinking a lot with kidney failure.    It sounds like he don't have any good days, he just has a few good moments in a miserable day.   


It's really close to or past time in my opinion (but I'm just an internet stranger)."
reactivedogs,febxdxm,t3_enwm7v,1578963855.0,Just noticed that lewis nicholls dog training has put out a pateron video (you can see info via the fb page) on dog reactivity to humans. It might be worth a look
dogs,fe9wd0s,t3_eo5tdp,1578942030.0,"Oh dear dog... I have 2 RR's and although they are very good at respecting your ""bubble"" they still occasionally bump us. I would be worried about having them around 90 year olds, and having them on an unfenced property yould be asking for dead dogs."
reactivedogs,fe6i6hh,t3_enwm7v,1578891670.0,"You rushed your dog. 

You should be the one giving your dog the treats not the stranger.
How long jas your dog had to settle back in with you? You have asked aot of your dog with a lot of change recently. 

Have a look at lewis nicholls dog training (on fb) and pages such as care cor reactive dogs. 

In the meantime look at getting an x pen to add to his crate while you are out. He isn't in a situation where a random walker is suitable at present."

AskReddit,fdrul9u,t1_fdriv0b,1578689999.0,"There has been a multi year drought in parts of Aussie, the temperatures have been the hottest they have been on record for many years in a row, and this year they are breaking all records.  Aussie gets lightning without significant rain, and that starts fires with lightning strikes.  Also the current fires are making their own weather - including lightning storms.  Also once you get bush burning, you get embers made - the temperature is so hot that these embers are now able to travel a good number of miles and start more fires.    


Due to the hot, dry weather, the usual practice of controlled burning to reduce fuel load has not been able to happen."
