I would suggest keeping your push and AO paces as they are, but start trying to bump up your base.  As your base increases, and you are comfortable with it, you can start adjusting the other two accordingly.

It took me three years to get to the running shape I am in now (which is ... decent, I guess?  Not terrible, but I'm no cheetah).  It will take time.  Just take little steps toward improvement and celebrate each of those steps."

orangetheory,fejle55,t3_epdxft,1579178832.0,"When I first started, I was always a ""treadmill first"" person.  As a big guy, the treadmill was easily the *hardest* part of the workout.  I figured ""If I survive these 23 minutes, I'm good"".  

Then I became a ""rower first"" person.  Learning to run after lifting, I read, was a ""better way to gain muscle and lose weight"".  Fifty articles will give you fifty different answers, though, so don't lean too much into that.

Now, I switch it up.  Sometimes you want to be fresh for that run (Endurance days).  Sometimes, you want to be fresh for the floor (Strength days).

The important thing is, you went, and you want to go again.  I hated, hated, HATED my first class.  But I signed up.  Now I can't imagine not going to OTF.

Celebrate every little win you get.  Did you up your tread by .1 this day?  Celebrate that shit.  Lift a heaver weight? Celebrate that shit.  Did your first full push-up?  Celebrate that shit!

Every goal is a win, no matter how big or small.

Good luck!"

orangetheory,fe813qi,t3_eo397e,1578921202.0,"That might be a function of your studio being new, so they want to make sure the trainers are getting classes split into half treads/half rower so each coach can get accustomed to coaching both sides of the room.

If there's only 10 people in the class (or something like that), then I kinda understand having everyone start in one spot, and letting the majority decide.  One Friday we were having a 1G and, almost **always**, our 1Gs start on the treadmill.  I casually said ""Hey, can we start on the rower today?"", and the coach said ""Sure!  Since nobody else asked, and you did, we'll do that"".

Our head coach will correct me on something, and I laugh and say ""oh, yeah, I see now - this is MUCH harder, no wonder I wasn't feeling it"".  That makes the coach understand that you actually welcome correction and he/she will not be hesitant to do so.
