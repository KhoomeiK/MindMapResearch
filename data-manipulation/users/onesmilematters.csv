Ironically, but most people are not aware of it, cooking vegan can enrich one's diet so much. It's like a whole new food world opens up that only few people are willing to explore."
AmItheAsshole,ffemufy,t1_ffdv7fl,1579854972.0,"I think a lot of people view a vegan diet as some exotic choice that just complicates things. So if we don't have anything to eat, it's our own fault. Some genuinely have no clue how to prepare vegan food and it's apparantly too much of a hassle to just look things up on the internet. I can't imaging acting that way myself for any kind of dietary restrictions my friends or family have, and it warms my heart to read comments like yours."
AmItheAsshole,ffdtqn0,t1_ffdr0uv,1579828706.0,And the real tragedy is that she probably spent more energy required to chew the dry leaves.
thewalkingdead,ffdp0k3,t1_ffdfcw5,1579825570.0,"Yes. I feel like they added Magna's group to the show because they were part of the comics but had no idea how to properly tie them into the tv series. I think some characters, like Connie, have great potential, but they need more exposure so we can really bond with them the way we did with our main characters.

Overall I think they simply have too many characters spread across too many communities/settings to allow for each of them to have enough meaningful screentime while still keeping the focus on a few main characters. And by trying to randomly feature more of the B and C characters, the thing OP describes happens: Lack of structure, lack of coherent narrative. 

TWD was at its best when we got to know the minor characters in relation to the main protagonists. When they gave them interesting, realistic and emotionally engaging backstories while having them be part of the main story and interact with the main group. Look at Tara's introduction alongside Glenn. Hell, Axel and Oscar were only part of the show for a few episodes and I bonded with them instantly. Bob was on for about a season and I still remember him fondly.

Except for Connie and Yumiko (as little more than a background character in the heads-on-spikes scene), I can't remember anyone of Magna's group having meaningful scenes with the established characters. They stick to themselves most of the time or are part of bigger group scenes with little substance. Meanwhile, they are somehow managing affairs over at Hilltop and it's like they haven't really earned that place story-wise."
AmItheAsshole,ffdjbhw,t1_ffd8huf,1579822081.0,"Which wouldn't even have been such an issue, *if* OP had not told her that she would make sure there was food for her. Her cousin seems like a reasonable person who would have brought her own food *if* *only* she had known that she'd only get served a few leaves of salad (and a couple of berries).

As a vegan myself I usually don't count on anyone accommodating me food-wise, so a simple vegan salad is better than nothing, and  I do give OP points for trying, but it is really not something that fills your stomach, especially not when everyone else is having a three-course meal. Next time just let your cousin know in advance that you're not up to cooking an extra dish for her."

She also behaved more like a dog, escorting me to and back from school, etc. Sadly, she vanished at a young age and I never got to say goodbye in real life. But she visited me in my dreams and I can still feel her watching over me.

I had to euthanize my last cat when she was old and sick. She died at the vet cuddled onto my lap. I took her body home because I wanted her to rest in our garden. Before we burried her, I sat with her body for a few minutes, saying goodbye.

Exactly. People are acting as if only her wants and needs matter. If you have a phobia, do what you have to do, but try to show some understanding for the other people involved as well and don't be pissed at them for doing something as normal and innocent as interacting with another human being. She could have asked him nicely to wash his hands and even told him she doesn't feel comfortable touching him until he showers, all fine, but she should have done this in a respectful manner. Besides, germs are everywhere - public transport, door handles, etc. If her phobia is so extreme, does she also expect her boyfriend to take a shower after touching things when they're out and about?"

If she had simply asked her boyfriend to wash his hands before he touched her, that would have been perfectly fine. Even if she had told him she can't get herself to touch him before he showers, it would have been fine. But not *like that*. Not by being pissed off at two other human's interaction. Her attitude showed little respect for either of the two men.

I am rewatching the series at the moment and I noticed how, during season 1 - 2, I was fully immersed in every scene. Both the visuals and the audio had a very different vibe to it. I haven't studied film, so I'm not exactly sure why, but the background sounds alone had me feeling like I was observing the scene from closeby and I could literally feel the heat or cold the characters felt (not so much in later seasons), The camera seemed to have a hauntingly powerful focus on the characters but also beautifully captured the scenery in any random scene. The  cuts/overall editing seemed more movie-like as well. Season 3 still had good writing (although I wasn't a fan of the Woodbury scenes in general, the parts featuring our group were still fantastic) but the cinematography was already lacking somewhat and went further downhill in subsequent seasons. The sets now often look and feel like sets (I don't know why, is it the location itself? or is it the lighting? the audio? the camera focus?)  and I have a hard time really getting into a scene the way I used to early on."

AskReddit,fdy6yua,t3_enb981,1578776741.0,"It's a tough question and probably requires individual answers, but in general I would say:

**By realizing and appreciating what you can do with what you got.**

In physical terms, I only learned to love my body when I got sick and I realized how perfect my body used to be. It could do all these amazing things like walking and jumping or carrying things. Most people's bodies automatically fill their lungs with precious air without them even realizing. Once your body stops working in ""normal"" ways, you realize that you took so many things for granted and that being able to *do* things (to walk or to breathe well...) is way more important than how you look. I know it's hard to appreciate when you have never experienced a struggling body and the daily hardships that come with it, but you just have to trust me when I tell you as long as your body can carry you through life, one way or another, it's a fucking miracle, no matter what your nose, your legs or your ass looks like. 

Mentally, it's similar for me. I struggle a lot with it because I'm not really capable to do much physically, and I feel like such a burden most of the time, but I try to do good with what I got. Can I make someone smile? Yes? That's awesome. Can I help someone, create something, lift people's spirits? I guess that's worth something. I know I feel a great deal of love and admiration for other people who do the same, so why am I not deserving of that love as well?

Obviously, self love, to some degree, goes back to the groundwork that was (or was not) laid in someone's early life. If a person has never gotten (much) positive feedback it is incredibly hard to build genuine self esteem upon and I wish it was as simple as pressing a button."
