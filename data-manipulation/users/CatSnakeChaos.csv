cats,fdi8pfu,t1_fdi8azq,1578437745.0,"Good on you for still being able to offer a sensible response after all these terrible comments.

Coming from the Netherlands where common opinion about keeping cats is very much like your own I hope your cutie gets better fast!"
cats,fdi8dor,t1_fdi76vn,1578437569.0,"Allthough I personally find it sad for the cats not to be able to go outside, if that's how you want to take care of them that's fine. 

I'm not going to argue any further because it seems very unlikely you'd change your opinion anyway, cheers."
cats,fdi6p6p,t1_fdi6bm4,1578436705.0,"I like how it's up to you to decide what's good reasoning and what isn't.

From my own experience this just doesn't apply to real life anyway, we could play for so long with our cats but they'd always end up wanting to go outside, especially when the wheather is nice."
cats,fdi62g9,t1_fdi3gyo,1578436371.0,"Dude they understand why their cat is injured, you're the one that doesn't seem to understand their reasoning for letting their cat roam outside. 

Where I live almost everybody feels the same way as the OP does about this."
cats,fdhyxjs,t1_fdhw757,1578432698.0,"I find it odd that people on reddit deliver judgement as if they know everything about the situation the OP is in. 

Here in the Netherlands at least 95% of people who have cats and live in small cities/vilages let out their cats, which makes this whole situation feel so weird."
watercooling,fde90m6,t1_fdcamu5,1578333825.0,"Same here man, they're so clean."
watercooling,fdc4jkx,t1_fdc47zn,1578266970.0,Yeah I doubt there are any perfect cases. I'm currently using a Define S2.
watercooling,fdbmjp3,t1_fdb56l4,1578258820.0,Not the OP but it's very easy (2 screws) to slide the PSU backwards to give you some working space.
watercooling,fdbbr0w,t1_fdagwx4,1578255835.0,"Now there's no way back haha, have fun!"
watercooling,fd90bjt,t3_ekbmml,1578226247.0,"Haha same here man, I've been drooling at pics of watercooled computers for so long.

Looks like a tight fit but it sure looks amazing, good job!"
watercooling,fd5v2z7,t3_ejtuhq,1578181864.0,"Beautiful build man, super clean and I love those frosted tubes."
watercooling,fd5j7m8,t3_ejyoyo,1578178186.0,"Looks wonderful man, love that you included the RAM in your loop."
watercooling,fd4d3l3,t1_fd3ke50,1578166480.0,"Oh yeah true. I hope that'll go a little easier with time, it's definitely way too tight."
watercooling,fd3byye,t1_fd3amzf,1578156796.0,"Oh what a cool gift from your friend!

Same here, my previous case was the original Meshify S haha. I would've gone for the meshified version of this one but afaik the front panel of that one is connected to the case which seems like a bit of a design flaw to me."
watercooling,fd30lvw,t1_fd2bubs,1578153620.0,"Thanks a lot! 

I think I only rarely spot them here, I liked building in it a lot and especially aesthetically it's just such a beautiful case imo."
watercooling,fd1je0t,t1_fd1i5at,1578132049.0,"I've always been a fan of the Dominators haha, I just could not resist. I think they're priced pretty decently for b-die with beautiful LEDs though."
watercooling,fd1iax6,t3_ejkssp,1578131614.0,"Awesome first build man, love the bend from the monoblock to the GPU!

Are there fans under the bottom rad?"
