I’m in exactly the same situation. When I keep quiet (no music or loud TV) and they pass by to go upstairs, it’s usually OK, probably thinking I’m not home. When I make noise they ‘walk’ a lot louder. Seems paranoid but it’s really obvious and I only found out after a long time.

It’s clearly caused by a complaint I made to the landlord (which happens to be the father of the guy above me) about them having a party in a weekday til 4am. That was last year; no more parties ever since.

Aside from the extremely racist shit they told me they had also some ‘funny’ stories.

So first of all this guy had a ‘boy’, literally called like that. So, a slave.

The ‘boy’ would help around the house but quite often steal like, practically everything. Drinking orange juice and replace it with dirty tapwater, stealing one sock so you’ll throw away the other one (and take that one too), hide cleaning products in his own house and wait until they forgot about it and then steal it.

The boy also prepared food and it was a ‘big mistake’ to give him leftovers of it, because he would order more and more and after a while would invite half of the village to ‘secret barbeques’. 

The old guy used to order big chunks of meat from argentina for his dog (hopefully a joke). He found out the boy would cut of tiny slices every few days and sell those later.

There are some other things i forgot, but man, it was really confusing hearing racist stuff being told so casually. A younger guy who was also present and who worked in africa as an engineer (couple of years ago) agreed with every single thing. He also said even tho they constantly steal your stuff (he had some bottles of wine stolen and later that day found them in a random store) he would go back if he had the chance."
