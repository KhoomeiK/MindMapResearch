Climate change would need to accelerate to the point of the seas rising several inches to a foot PER YEAR for us to be impacted so ""directly"" as this projection map suggests. I'm not buyin' it. Someone did the math wrong."
gonewild,fff0t87,t1_ff5t58h,1579872535.0,Hell no. It'd be awesome.
BadDragon,ffezaq4,t3_et7vi5,1579871178.0,Damn you are gorgeous. You look like a girl I used to date before I got into bad-dragon toys. Sure would've loved to introduce her to wereables. :P

AMDHelp,ff6inkn,t3_err72k,1579628016.0,"Assuming your CPU cooler is stock, temps around 26c is perfectly normal at idle/under minor load for utilities such as a browser watching youtube videos.

Assuming your cpu cooler isn't stock, temps below 30c at idle/minor load are also totally normal.

Your GPU also would have nothing to do with your CPU temps going up or down--especially at that LOW of a temp."
