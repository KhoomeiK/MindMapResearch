AskReddit,ffdef1m,t1_ffd45vx,1579819136.0,"Fair enough. I have an AT as well and I just use manual mode and shift paddles when I feel like I want to control the gears myself. It's not as fun for me as much as a manual can be, but it makes for a decent daily driver which can also be fun to drive."
classicwow,ffd2e5w,t1_ffd1y8x,1579812066.0,"Premades existed to adapt as well. The problem is neither of the factions, it's the faction imbalance itself."

Outside of this context, you still prefer automatic?"
classicwow,ffcu1u6,t1_ffcprdg,1579807258.0,"Nobody had it coming. Don't act like the Alliance are holy players and wouldn't have ganked if they were outnumbering Horde. In fact on my server, the alliance was actually the one preventing horde to play out in the world.

Blizzard didn't control faction balance and now both factions are suffering."
classicwow,ffctzin,t1_ffcszve,1579807221.0,"I disagree with the guy but I doubt alliance premade raises horde queue times. If anything, it makes queue time even shorter because more alliance will Queue av if they can win + matches usually end quickly."

classicwow,ffcj9xo,t1_ffchdyh,1579800653.0,You're missing the point. A loot council's job is to make sure the items are going at the right place. If the LC is doing the opposite then the roster might start losing members which is an issue.

classicwow,fdjn4y2,t1_fdjjfpt,1578478975.0,"Well, they don't have to. They have the wonderful option of waiting for a pug tank or finding a friend/cheaper tank.

But if they want a raid tank that's his payment. I think it's fair as long as it's agreed upfront."
classicwow,fdjko8d,t1_fdh04ff,1578475394.0,"I used rawr extensively during wotlk, it was a standalone app which could either import from armory or allow you to create your character manually. I think they switched to add-ons but I haven't tried it.

Rumors say there's a 1.12 version lying around but I have yet to find a trace of it."
classicwow,fdjkcnr,t1_fdjj1tv,1578474925.0,"Yeah it is sad playing classic expecting contentful endgame and exciting gameplay. I think you were either mislead by some players or misunderstood what classic is about. Either way you're not the only one because I've seen a lot of rush-to-engame mentality and lots of players with a FOMO since release and I doubt these players will stay in the long run.

If you don't see the point of classic now, I doubt that'll change next patch."
classicwow,fdjih25,t1_fdjcdre,1578472310.0,"Countless of posts where saying it was pointless to rush endgame, to enjoy the game while leveling because it's half the game, that endgame was slow and so on.

It's barely possible if you've been just once on Reddit since the classic announcement that you haven't seen such post.

My recommendation for you is make an alt if you haven't already. The game isn't going anywhere yet."
classicwow,fdgvzyu,t3_el97c2,1578409706.0,"Preventing premade is a false good idea. The issue aren't premades, it's faction imbalance. Preventing premades will just cause alliance to abandon AV to premade WSG instead, causing even greater queue times for horde AV while they grind pugs at WSG gy"
classicwow,fdgutkp,t1_fdgk4fg,1578408874.0,"No, they have to fix faction imbalance. Preventing alliance from doing premades will just make alliance queue for WSG premades instead for better honor/hour, which will cause horde to have 1hour+ queues for AV and even a harder time winning in WSG which is already near impossible"
classicwow,fdgs7q0,t1_fdgj2a6,1578406975.0,"I'm horde and I had to stop playing during  p2 because I couldnt step foot outside to level at 50+ without getting corpsecamped by alliance players in every zones even when I played at night the most hardcore players where still ganking me in groups.

I legitimately recall a week where I only met one single lvl 60 that didn't kill me on sight because he was farming herbs.

And now I'm being told to suck it because I deserved it?"
classicwow,fdgrerq,t1_fdgc7t5,1578406370.0,Didn't know ganking was exclusive to horde but hey let's blame the players for choosing their favorite faction while Blizzard did sweet FA to help faction balancing.
classicwow,fdgprgf,t3_ekya4j,1578405080.0,"It's shit either way. Being only allowed one single AV per hour and loosing it to a premade is not fun nor is being ""forced"" to never stop fighting to keep up."
classicwow,fdgcv9s,t1_fdg823p,1578390635.0,"Nah rawr took your rotation, talent points, set bonuses, procs, raid buffs and basically everything into account to calculate theorical dps and sort items by actual dps contribution.

While I use Sixtyupgrades and think it's a fine app it's basically just weighting raw items stats to each other and ignores any specifics. It's really good to browse and filter potential items and where to find them."

classicwow,fdewjzg,t1_fdev2ve,1578348091.0,"Nochange was meant to object to modern QoL implementations to avoid a ""retail but capped at 60 and with less content"" that many feared could happen if Blizzard did Blizzard things."
classicwow,fddu81s,t1_fddrpl0,1578324098.0,"Huh. I've been playing on a HD Radeon 7640G from 2013(?) for a couple of weeks and I also get between 15 and 25 fps in AV with every graphics settings at the lowest but I guess playing in a lower resolution and having no other processes running in the background helps tremendously. (Not even chrome or Battlenet, it chockes the poor computer)

I'm usually cruising at 40fps in dungeons with the exceptional half-second freeze happening now and then."

classicwow,fddlgzu,t1_fdd81tw,1578316789.0,Yeah AV is pretty bad on GPU-less dino-laptops. you can try downscaling your resolution a bit to see if it helps and disabling add-ons who parse huge amount of data like recount and such.
classicwow,fddlas1,t3_eks89e,1578316612.0,"I'm not a fan of the newest models and animations but I'm pretty sure not putting them as options in classic WoW is to keep this as an exclusivity of retail. ""Want this better looking game? Want these cool mounts? Buy retail!"""

classicwow,fddargg,t3_ekmi76,1578302979.0,We did exactly this. I leveled as arms and my GF was Holy priest with improved smite and the talent which gives Mana Regen after a killing blow. We healed/tanked 5man easily like this up to 60 and quests where a breeze. Just don't forget to let the priest have some kills while questing and you won't even have to stop for Mana.
