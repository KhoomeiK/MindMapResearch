college,fejarg9,t3_epebom,1579164564.0,"My gap year wasn't fully by choice but I'd like to share my experience anyways.

I was more or less forced to defer a semester of college due to severe health issues and by the time I actually was able to go to what was my ""dream school"" I went to the first 3 days of classes and realized I didn't want to be an arts major and ended up back home.

I ended up at my local community college I was chomping at the bit to begin school and I was throughly enjoying my new major (psychology) until I realized that wasn't what I wanted to do either. I graduated with my associate's and transferred to my new school as an archeology major and I love it.

The important thing that I took from it was that it probably would've taken me so much longer to end up where I am now if none of that happened. I'm also super lucky to have my mom's support through this whole mess. Funny thing is I orginally wanted to study history so I ended up full circle.

I also worked babysitting for a lovely family until they moved back to their home state across the country.

Do what you feel is best for you! If you have any other questions I can try to answer!"
college,feja6fj,t1_fej7vto,1579163728.0,"I want to add that also look into activities from your major/department that are outside of classes! My advisor when I first looked into transfering to my now school told me the most successful people in the department (anthropology I'm an archeology major) are the ones who don't just go to class.

He's been super supportive and is happy to see how well I've meshed with my friends and told me how happy he is that ""I found my people"". 

Classes are also so much more enjoyable when you find people in your major you make connections with! Some of my closest friends I've met in my archaeology classes!"

The fatigue improves and I don't notice anymore. When I first started it actually helped me sleep which was a massive improvement from before when I'd be exhausted 24/7. I personally have had a great experience with it (but of course just my experience)."
