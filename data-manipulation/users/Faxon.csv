Been up all night and now its 9am and I'm lying in bed waiting for my room to cool off a bit so I can calm down more and sleep. They died from the exact kind of car accident I was worried they would as well, they were new to driving still and had got a rwd car with a poor collision safety rating for their first car. Somehow lost the road just a little bit and hit some sand on the shoulder of an undivided 2 lane highway, lost their lane the opposite direction and went head on into someone else who had a passenger. Both made it last I heard. I met them through my work because they were a regular at the pizza place/club I worked at. They were raped shortly after and reached out to me after I commented on their posts about it, and we ended up hooking up the same night. They said it was therapeutic for them even though it was hard for them for months but they got through it and over time they started doing better. They discovered they were trans and got on T and it helped their health immensely, and I gave them a place to live with me for 4 months while they were homeless during the start of it. They were finally mentally stable(ish) and happy when it happened, and they were only 25. Lost an ex as well who I hadn't seen in years the year before that to a fent OD (bad heroin) and they helped me out of it after once I stopped totally alienating myself, and now I'm not doing much better than i was then. It does get easier but at the same time it really doesn't either, when its people you love.

trees,fen0kse,t1_femzg6p,1579274272.0,"You won't really, most weed has a little bit of THC degraded regardless, it's just about the dose response curve here.

Take a trip over to /r/cannabisextracts and look at the resources there if you'd like to learn more about how decarboxylation can happen, some of the older tools are extremely in depth on the science behind it, in addition to teaching you how to do it properly yourself if you ever want to make your own edibles or topicals."

When I have kids I'm getting a lock box to keep in my fridge with all my wax so they can't get into it without knowing the combo, in case the ""it's medicine and not meant for young kids"" line fails. At least they'll have accurate info and the expectation that they'll get to choose to try it themselves when they're old enough instead of fearmongering and lies. I had good enough info because I decided to educate myself and waited longer than most of my friends and i definitely feel like I garnered some developmental benefits that most of them didn't because the only one from that group who waited is the only one I still talk to (and also an ex now lol), not to mention my longest friend period.

If you drive a hard bargain but show up ready to walk off the lot that same day you can definitely make them squirm a bit, you just have to be ready to go home empty handed.

Sure they could shoot it from the tower but it was fucking hilarious to do if you already had B and C and you were trying to quick deploy extra troops in right on the tower and wanted to have some fun. Crammed 2 blockade sunderers and a rep sunderer all on there once without destroying them or having them fall off and we had us a proper hold off with engineers repping the sundies and all the guns firing away lmao.
