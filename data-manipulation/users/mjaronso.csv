PhotoshopRequest,ff88i2h,t1_ff7e2fe,1579669078.0,This is a perfectly lobbed alley-oop.
ObscureMedia,ff88830,t1_ff6zab9,1579668832.0,"I’m unclear about the exact timeline of these techniques, but on static shots like this one filmmakers would use a basic matte in frame and expose one plane of action, and then reverse the matte to expose the other parts of the frame. The result is both images appear at the same time in the frame. Perhaps in this instance, because you can see the matte isn’t quite perfect when some of the ladies’ hats cross the screen, they may have shot the “movie within the movie” first, and then later shot the foreground scene. This could also be an example of a “traveling matte” typically used for moving shots. First, the actors are filmed in front of a black background, in this example the black background would be the movie screen in frame. Then, by repeatedly transferring the image to a high contrast film stock you‘d create a silhouette of the foreground, and then use that as a matte when shooting the background footage. Likely the former technique in this case, due to the overlapping images and imperfect matte, but I could be wrong!"
