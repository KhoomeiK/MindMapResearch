It's pretty far north in CA, north of Sacramento. The area around there is not exactly ""stereotypical CA"". It's actually fairly conservative in the North (Butte, Tehama, Shasta, etc.). Lots of farming near Chico. It's not a huge city, nor is the Redding, the biggest city in northern CA."

news,fdfkzwn,t1_fdedau5,1578364144.0,"Wasn't McDonald's sued for using beef tallow to cook fries? Iirc it was a religious dietary issue, they asked and were told there was no beef.

A lawsuit might seem like an over reaction in some cases but there are a lot of people that take their diets very seriously. Imagine it was an allergy, that could be an emergency.  Also, if the food vendor gave bad info about their products it seems like at the very least they're in the wrong to some degree.

Anyway, I don't eat some things by choice. Recently I ordered a burrito from Chipotle online and when I picked it up and bit into it, it was full of pork. It bothered me but ultimately I just went back in and had them remake it and that was the end of the matter. Still, I thought at the time, if I was allergic this could have been a problem.  Just wanted to give my perspective on it given it sort of happened to me.

history,fctmuun,t3_eiuljs,1577949398.0,"Not an expert but serving food for money existed as far back as the Romans at least.

See ""Commercial food prep"" on the following page:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_dining_in_the_Roman_Empire

I think the French are credited for the first ""restaurants"". Read below for more.

""The first restaurant proprietor is believed to have been one A. Boulanger, a soup vendor, who opened his business in Paris in 1765. The sign above his door advertised restoratives, or restaurants, referring to the soups and broths available within. The institution took its name from that sign, and “restaurant” now denotes a public eating place in English, French, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Romanian, and many other languages, with some variations. For example, in Spanish and Portuguese the word becomes restaurante; in Italian it is ristorante; in Swedish, restaurang; in Russian, restoran; and in Polish, restauracia.

Although inns and hostelries often served paying guests meals from the host’s table, or table d’hôte, and beverages were sold in cafés, Boulanger’s restaurant was probably the first public place where any diner might order a meal from a menu offering a choice of dishes""
