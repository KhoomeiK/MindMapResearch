DIYBeauty,fee34at,t3_eogjub,1579025404.0,Don't use the sea buckthorn straight. Only use it diluted because it stains your skin....bad!

It's one of my favorite in the world too.

SkincareAddiction,fdp6y5c,t1_fdnqsa8,1578621437.0,"This is not KP. Keratosis pilaris does not look anything like this. KP is red or skin color bumps on the skin that can be anywhere but I will bet my business on it. (I make bye bye KP, a lotion specifically for KP). What this looks like, to me, is dry skin that is sensitive in a few areas causing shave bumps. Try vitamin E. Use a light exfoliating scrub or wash cloth before shaving. Try a warm wrap before and after you shave. I'm sure other people will have really great ideas too. I hope you update this post and let us know how it all worked out for you!!"

I'm sorry about the police not taking this seriously because it truly is and don't think for one second that this isn't domestic violence. Go to the shelter talk to the manager and they will hopefully know exactly what to do. Take video also of your home and show it to them.

DIYBeauty,fddhhsb,t1_fddgn0r,1578312488.0,"Yes. The above answer is perfect. To add, try a very minimal exfoliating lotion first to get rid of the dry skin and start fresh. Or use a coarse wash cloth if your skin in is to sensitive. Walgreens has sample size lotions and cleaners by the make up. Usually in a small basket. Try them! You might find your favorite In sample size before buying 8 to see what works best for you. Good luck."
