todayilearned,feozr93,t1_feolo6l,1579308936.0,"I totally think he made some important points, but you can't be anti technology when the modern world is innovating at a furious pace. It's a super complicated social question - What technologies do we allow and who is responsible for the ethics of emerging technologies? Ted had it wrong by killing people and the crimes probably overshadowed his message. There are theories that Ted cracked after being part of psychological CIA experiments (MKULTRA) during his time at Harvard. Check out the 2003 doc 'The Net'."

letstradepedals,fdoqcwo,t1_fdol2rr,1578610490.0,fair point. so the Volante would be way too much in your case. Im a bit of a tape echo addict lol. I also dug the Wampler Faux Tape but the Deco would be fine for slapback. G'luck!
letstradepedals,fdod0km,t3_em2ck6,1578602916.0,"LOL to ""1 week + 1 day.""

TBH the El Cap is one of the best tape delays out there. I heard the Belle Epoch has noise issues. The Deco isnt really a dedicated delay, only does slapback at more extreme settings. Having a El Cap/Deco combo would be ideal. Also consider the Volante over other tape delays. It's the only delay that knocked the El Cap off my board."
