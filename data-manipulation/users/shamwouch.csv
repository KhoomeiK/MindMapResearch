California business has been draining to Texas for over a decade because of low taxes and cost of doing business. Pretty weak to bring up Kansas and just blissfully ignore what's going on with the two biggest states in the country. 

When we talk about sales/business/income taxes, we're assuming that higher taxes wouldn't work to drive away the business that's in the province now. But we know that low taxes do attract business (which means more revenue). How much? Who knows. Nobody wants to discuss this. They just want to bitch at Alberta and pretend that sales tax is a one-size-fit-all and that the market isn't a dynamic system."

Introducing a PST will only make everything more expensive for average Albertan's and guarantee the government will feel more comfortable wasting money in the future. The UCP has already been making ridiculous spending decisions, there's no reason to give them a bigger shovel for the hole they're digging."
