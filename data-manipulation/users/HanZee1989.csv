funny,ff7y8rj,t3_erzsk7,1579661207.0,I almost dropped my phone in the sink I’m laughing so fucking hard.
muacirclejerk,feh96ci,t1_fegn7cy,1579111742.0,I love Raw Beauty Kristi. She just seems so damn genuine. I used to get that vibe from Tati in the beginning now I can barely stand her. I honestly think that my falling off with Tati came from watching Kristi. Also Tati is on the positive vibes and let me tell you how to be amazing like me in my 45 minute intro to each video. I own your pallet already get to the effing makeup.
itookapicture,fede467,t1_feddyok,1579008973.0,ZeeZee walks around and chirps all day. She’s not scared of anything and she wants to be near you but not touched. Like literally right next to you or on top of you. But don’t touch her. She doesn’t get mad if you do she just chirps and leaves. They are seriously their own kind! Something magical about calicos.
itookapicture,fedd7ne,t1_fedc8xx,1579008205.0,I’ve seen calicos that look so different and than I see ones where they could literally be the same cat. I love them. She was love at first sight when I met her as a kitten.
