God bless you too - have a great day and weekend!"
Christianity,ffg6b3k,t3_etcarx,1579899385.0,"This has always annoyed me about Christianity and American politics. 

I’m a proud American liberal, and I’m a proud Christian. In fact, going to Catholic schools K-12 was what really shaped my political views, as Catholic social justice defined what I want our politicians and country to aim for. I want fairness. I want the eradication of poverty. I want morality. 

Somehow though, people think that the abortion debate is the end all be all of one’s Christian and political views. It’s annoying, particularly because I see evangelicals (who basically stand for everything I oppose) gain power and warp this weird version of American Christianity I do not recognize. 

I’m fully prepared for people to tell me I’m wrong, and I hope I didn’t offend anyone. Just stating my truth about being an American liberal secure in my Christian faith."

popheads,ffckcaf,t1_ffch0vq,1579801295.0,"Oh yeah, I wasn’t discrediting anyone in my post. Just saying what happened. 

I don’t recall reading that Kanye sent the flowers as an apology, though. I believe he just sent them. I remember reading that a chill went down Taylor’s spine during a part of his speech (don’t remember what part, but it’s in her 2019 Rolling Stones interview), but they seemed to move beyond that until the infamous phone call after he called her multiple times leading up to the 2015 MTV Awards. 

The whole situation is bonkers. Truly a pop culture feud nobody will ever forget."
SchittsCreek,ffccclv,t3_erg0zz,1579796392.0,"I watched all of this a few days ago! It’s funny because after seeing this and a few other interviews, she’s actually super different than Alexis in almost every way. I was expecting SOME Alexis mannerisms, but she doesn’t have any of them. 

She’s seriously awesome and one of the nicest people out there."
fatlogic,ffc8g0t,t3_esu14w,1579793925.0,"I have worked on and off in sleep clinics both clinically and administratively for 6 years. With that in mind, I always wonder how people truly believe that BMI is outdated. 

I’d wager 99% of patients I’ve seen who are diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea have a BMI over 25. Generally from there, the lower your BMI, the lower your CPAP pressure. 

Sleep apnea is a serious thing that is so outrageously under-looked in today’s society that it makes me mad to see that people dismiss this serious health problem as just snoring. The better you sleep, the higher chances you have for improved heart health (by reduced risk for high blood pressure and irregular heart beats), mental health (by reduced anxiety and depression), etc.  

Long story short, BMI is extraordinarily helpful in sleep medicine unless you are a child, have large tonsils, etc. I just wish these people could see the types of people I’ve seen who have later died due to the effects of obesity/not wanting to improve their sleep health."
popheads,ffc1m6y,t1_ffbw7r0,1579789243.0,"Basically the entire 1989 era, peaking with her presenting Kanye with the MTV Vanguard Award in 2015. 

I remember Kanye coming up in a few of her interviews where’d she say that she’s forgiven him, he really respects her now, they’re friends, etc."
popheads,ffc09n4,t1_ffbyh2k,1579788212.0,"Oh it’s definitely good! One of my favorites of 2017. 

I guess I meant that it’s sad that her singles haven’t quite recovered commercially to what they were before. Critically, I think she just gets better and better."
popheads,ffblxxg,t3_eskqom,1579771855.0,"Man, I agree about Die Young. I was a HARDCORE Kesha stan in the early 2010s, and it’s wild and sad to see how her career never really recovered from that following Sandy Hook (minus Timber) and the Dr. Luke trial. She has such a great voice that it’s disappointing to see she couldn’t reach #1 again with that awesome bop."
popheads,ff9sqw7,t3_esadm1,1579720437.0,"I was SUPER into Billboard rankings back then, and if it helps, Gangnam Style peaking at #2 was actually the cause for Billboard to tweak their formula (as another user mentioned, YouTube views weren’t counted as highly as they are now). 

It definitely was a huge hit - it just happened to get stuck behind Maroon 5’s One More Night for several weeks due to the formula used at the time."
popheads,ff9qm37,t1_ff9mr4b,1579718823.0,"I personally like it (even the “spelling is fun!”), but after hearing all of Lover, it doesn’t really fit well on the album imo, especially being placed after the perfect gem that is Afterglow."
popheads,ff9kzyo,t3_esdnes,1579715217.0,"No idea why, but I always live for Taylor actually drinking and/or referencing it in her songs. I’m THRILLED that wine is making a guest appearance yet again in this documentary."

It will treat the superficial scars very well (to the point where you won’t see them), and with the deeper ones, they’ll be reduced in color/size, so much so that it might improve your confidence. 

I’ve had laser treatments for some scars I have, and I highly recommend finding a local dermatologist to take it from here. It will absolutely help."

SubredditDrama,fedexb3,t1_fed13ru,1579009646.0,"Yeah, the suspended license bit stuck out to me, and I was a bit disappointed to see that it wasn’t explained anywhere. 

Giving the OP significant trust here, but let’s say this behavior is super unusual and he would “never” drink and drive. Why is his license suspended, though? That’s a big red flag that his driving history probably wasn’t the best even before this incident occurred. 

Probably best that he stays off the roads for awhile and that he hopefully gets the help he needs regarding his binge drinking."
fatlogic,fdq9lnx,t3_emndh8,1578660321.0,"I’ve worked in clinical and administrative settings in healthcare for about 7 years. If these people daily saw what poor health can do to you, your body, and your loved ones who have to also see it, I’m confident they wouldn’t say such things.

It’s really depressing. It’s why I now daily visit this sub - to lead a healthier life by reducing my BMI from 27 to about 21-22 while ensuring I don’t fall into a “who cares, I’ll be fine no matter what I do!” trap."
fatlogic,fdgq9kd,t3_elb410,1578405478.0,"Wow, I feel bad for her heart if she lost and gained 100 lbs in that short of a time frame.

Christianity,fdgolyz,t3_el9u5r,1578404123.0,"I’m sorry to be that guy, but it’s been like this way for decades. It’s not just a recent thing.

I regularly listen to music from the 60s to 2020, and depending on the artist and the decade’s mainstream influences, you can easily find veiled or blunt references to drugs, sex, violence, etc. Sometimes, I find it wild to listen to 60s music since if they’re not dead, I automatically think of what they’re like now in their 70s and 80s. 

Every decade has its thing, even though the music itself evolves. It’s not the end of the world - it’s just new generations embracing artists who “understand” them or allow people an escape to fantasize. 

I agree to an extent that I’d rather not hear artists promoting hard drug use or murder, but that’s just me. It’s not artists’ job to parent children, and in many cases, they admit they are not role models. It’s up to audiences to decide their responses, and so far in the past several decades, we’re still doing alright, knowing right from wrong, etc."
Christianity,fdg754j,t3_el12o8,1578382775.0,"Awesome, way to go!!

It seems like you’re definitely doing the right thing. Also, the fact that you’re acknowledging this and actively making a difference is already important and puts you miles ahead of some people I know.

You can definitely do it - best of luck!"

Epilepsy,fdg37dr,t3_ejwy65,1578378320.0,"So many great suggestions in this thread.

My only other suggestion is to share the reality of SUDEP (Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy). SUDEP is more likely to occur to men, is often the result of poor medication maintenance, etc.

I’m not sure how old he is, but as a man, I religiously take my meds due to this and have been seizure-free since 2014 as a result.

I know it’s extreme, but I hope this helps for your husband’s physical health/safety and your mental health. 

Best of luck to you! I hope he listens to you ASAP"

It sucks that people will overlook everything Adele has done in her amazing career to solely describing her by her weight. She’s always been stunning and has had a dynamite voice, so she deserves much more.

Also, kudos for the $2000 tip. If I were a millionaire, I’d love to do stuff like that."
Christianity,fbhafie,t3_ed9rvt,1576869029.0,"Seeing as [literally 99% of Republican white evangelicals](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/99-of-white-evangelical-protestants-oppose-impeaching-and-removing-trump/) opposed impeaching and removing Trump in October, I hope that some time passed & this op-ed convert at least some of them. 

I will never understand how evangelicals can lead such record-breaking support for Trump, out of ALL people. The man who publicized his own affairs back in the 80s. The man who celebrated greed and flaunted it throughout the world. The guy who didn't even know the Lord's Prayer at former President George H.W. Bush's funeral. 

It is truly mind-boggling."
