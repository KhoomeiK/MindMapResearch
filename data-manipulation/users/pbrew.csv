AskEngineers,ff6di28,t3_eru0e7,1579624827.0," If I am not mistaken, you are talking about a particular branch of Geometry called Mensuration.  I actually think that this order is in fact better suited to prepare a student for Calculus later in the course study.   Any problem of area or volume can be taught as a sum total of smaller units such a volume of a cylinder being the sum total of discs each of which is a unit thick.  Similarly for area. and so on."
askscience,ff3ndc3,t1_ff338hg,1579544755.0,"With an active involvement in Solar and other renewable energy adoption, I have always believed  that the answer is - all of the above, especially at this moment in time.  The worst one i.e. coal is already dying. Rooftop solar is a very good option and needs to be considered before we move on to ground based systems which use up good land.    If we go into deserts then we are impacting that ecosystem and also incurring huge transmission costs.  The rooftop systems are very efficient as they mostly deliver at the point of use. Plus we have not fully exploited the vast availability of roof tops incl. warehouses, Train/Bus stations, Office buildings etc.  On the open land based Solar based systems, I had proposed a dual use Solar farms to many Utilities in some third world countries.  Such as growing crops under solar panels, in some case creating greenhouses etc.  What I found was there is little interest in these kind of solutions for 'hard core' power engineers in Utilities.  However there has been some positive improvements in these areas since then."
OldSchoolCool,ff1i8m6,t1_fezw9j9,1579479632.0,"It is never a question of Right or Wrong in these matters.  Long term Strategy with material considerations such as Oil, play a big part. Sometimes we are forced by treaty law and in the rarest cases by humanitarian considerations.  Lately,  insidious ego-driven desires lit by the slimmest of doubt or misinformation have taken us to War such as Iraq part II.

If that was not the case then why did the US sitout the Chinese Invasion of Tibet, the mutual massacre in millions in Rwanda, Congo. In this case the alliance happened because the World was threatened by one of the largest Oil producer taking over another very significant Oil producer.   Once the Oil drains out, most of  the Middle East will return to the desert."

personalfinance,fef094o,t3_eomfof,1579045145.0,PTO is Paid time off. You have earned it. Though people may use the term PTo loosely. The best way to check is if your payroll stub shows the hours of PTO earned every pay period.  If it does then it has to be paid to you when you leave the job.  However more and more tech companies are moving to the DTO i.e. discretionary time off model which is something you negotiate with your manager. This pays you nothing when you leave.
DIY,fedzact,t1_fedqvs2,1579023039.0,"Lets not forget the many side benefits of having Solar panels on your roof.  Before that, in many cases it brings the tariff to the lowest tiers from the higher excessive ones. This may vary state to state.  So considering $0.10KWH in my state would be being very conservatives.   For me, my Solar PV offset my $0.18 to $0.24 KWHs to a significant degree. Also once you have it on the roof it provides added insulation. For example - your house loses/gets 55% of heat from the roof.  So the PV panels will visibly impact the heating/cooling of the room(s) underneath. Second, you also need to consider that you are also insulated from tariff increases from your state utility. In my state this has averaged 5-6% over the last 30 years."

explainlikeimfive,febxs5n,t3_eo514a,1578964014.0,"A locomotive does not have a transmission in the same sense as a car.  Locomotives in general are Diesel-Electric.  This means that the wheels are not mechanically connected to the Engine. The wheels are connected to traction motors which provide the motive force.  The motors are themselves powered by the electric power generated by the massive generators which are run by the diesel engine.  The reason for this as follows. 

A locomotive is typically generating about 4000-5000 HP.  An IC Engine (diesel)  producing this kind of power is huge including the main drive shaft.  Now the wheels which are roughly the size of a truck wheel rotate at a fairly high RPM in order to move linearly at 60-90 MPH.  The massive drive shaft which cannot rotate at very high speeds due to the immense mechanical forces involved. So it will need a massive transmission system to match the high speeds needed at the wheels which is not viable.  This is the reason why Locomotives are Diesel-Electric.  The other huge advantage of this is that it enables easy coupling of multiple locomotives to run bigger and bigger trains with one point of control.  All the traction motors on the multiple locomotives run off the same electrical BUS to which all the Locomotive engine/generators are contributing electrical energy to."

Look at the destruction of temples, nose cut off of Idols to complete destruction etc.   Forced conversions and poll tax etc.  The large number of muslims that are present in South Asia today were not brought by the Mughals from Central Asia and neither are they their descendents. In fact are mostly the descendents of those South Asians who were often forcibly converted at that time.  This is a thorny issue but the root cause of all the current unrest in the area."

Post WWII working alongside Allied democracies would have been better. Socialism only brought misery by slowing economic development.  The Russian Indian friendship is nowhere near what it is extolled to be in India. Read what happened to the deal to buy the carrier Gromyko.
