Naturopathy, crystals, tiger ballsack amulets, chi point prodding, zodaic consultations, muscle testing, leeching (yes, still...), the goop Gwyneth Paltrow pushes...people buy into all of it. Because they want to. It isn't a conspiracy. 

When it comes to such a complex and vital issue as health, people are driven by hope and fear and are going to chug the snake oil and ask for more if they believe there is a chance that it might work. And of course they want it to work, becaus they want to feel better--they are biased to want to believe in the claims. People spend billions and billions every year on quackery. No conspiracy...it's just what we do. People are people. 

But some of us in the modern age are trying--trying--to hold to a standard of objective, verifiable evidence. And chiropractics just doesn't have the objective evidence to back it up. If it did, it would be standard medical practice performed and/or coordinated in hospital, like physical therapy is.

WTF,ff4uelu,t1_fcgg36p,1579572684.0,"\> Chiropractors think that by adjusting the misalignments they can thereby restore the nerve signals and cure health problems. This idea was first propounded in 1895 by [D. D. Palmer](http://www.palmer.edu/Palmer/Pages/Page.aspx?id=218&libID=238) (1845-1913), a grocer and [magnetic healer](http://skepdic.com/mesmer.html) from Davenport, Iowa. Palmer was a [vitalist](http://skepdic.com/vitalism.html) who considered intelligent [energy](http://skepdic.com/energy.html) to be conveying information among various body parts. There is no scientific evidence to support these ideas.  

And...

\>  Despite the fact that chiropractors claim there are thousands of studies that prove the effectiveness of spinal manipulation, most support for chiropractic comes from [testimonials](http://skepdic.com/testimon.html) of people who claim to have been helped by manipulation. Whether they were helped because nerves were ""unblocked"" has not been established. And there is no way to measure whether any so-called intelligent energy is even present, much less affected by manipulation. Most of these testimonials have come from people who believe their back pain was alleviated by spinal manipulation. Whether the manipulation is any more effective than a back rub, hot creams, exercise, or time, is questionable. The clinical evidence indicates that a treatment of something like ibuprofen and exercise is just as effective as chiropractic for relieving back pain (Ernst and Singh 2008).

>There is evidence to support the work of Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock.

No. At least not for rigorous definitions of ""evidence"". The Graham Hancock video was interesting. He's an engaging speaker and seems like a nice guy. But it could serve as an object lesson for how to delude yourself.

We start off with a song about angels and then an anecdote about his near death experience (your first tip-offs about standards of evidence on the table). After a brief pause to swipe at a strawman of Dawkins, we then watch Hancock present a lot of interesting cultural tidbits as he constructs a fairy castle of coincidence after coincidence.

But they aren't *really* coincidences, are they? These are products of humanity, and humans have the same basic mental structures, with the same drives, fears, motives, hopes, the same types of environments, the same night sky to look up into.

Dig through thousands of years of history to find humanity's varying cultural products with similar motifs, and gee golly, you're absolutely going to find what you're looking for.  And Hancock is great at doing so, and explaining it with interest.  And with a lot of ""well, it seems to me that"" sorts of connections between them.

This has a very good chance of being related to the wealth of Mormon evidence for Jesus and Israelites in the Americas.
