AskReddit,fg7zqlf,t3_exagml,1580605683.0,Not playing high school baseball. I only played baberuth. After my 16 yo season I quit because during allstars I got half the teams MVPs batted over .800 and had 0 errors. I didnt think I could get better so I quit playing. I look back now and wish I had played high school ball 9-12 grades instead of just baberuth. I know I wasn't good enough to play in the MLB but I may have had a chance at AA/AAA or maybe semipro ball. I absolutely loved to play but just made a poor choice to not.
