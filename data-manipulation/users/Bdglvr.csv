I just didn’t consider that to be exercise because it was something I enjoyed doing, and people always described exercise as torture."
fatlogic,ff7517n,t3_es061w,1579641259.0,"I was very thin all the way through high school. I played sports so was probably working out 3+ hours 5 days a week and eating relatively healthy foods to keep my energy up in order to do that. 

I stayed thin in college because I had to walk around a huge campus all day, could only afford to eat homemade food and worked as a nanny chasing kids around. 

My BMI crossed into overweight territory after I got a desk job and started eating/drinking whatever I wanted. 

Amazingly, now that I am watching what I eat and making sure to move more, I’m thin again! But it has nothing to do with my habits, my body just decided to be thin again."

AmItheAsshole,fenjqsr,t3_epyl1d,1579286180.0,YTA for saying anything about her possible future weight as if your only concern is about what she will look like as she ages. You wouldn’t have been an AH if you were actually only concerned about her health because if that’s truly how she eats on a daily basis that could catch up to her in other ways besides her weight.

I would just avoid the topic of costs with her altogether. If she brings it up, shut her down by saying you and your fiancé have discussed and agreed to the budget for that item. If she continues to badger I would probably get slightly snarky and ask when you should expect a check from her for the cost of that item, but that’s just me lol."

Our house isn’t even particularly difficult to see and stands out from the rest surrounding it, and no one else has ever encountered issues finding it with a GPS. 

Ordering pizza from this place always includes the delivery driver calling me 40 times and then me standing on the street corner waiting for him and waving my arms around, so yeah I started to not tip him as much because to me delivery means delivering the food to me where I’m at which is inside my house."

The tourist town was 25 MPH. So all of the tourists LOVED to speed in the rural areas and then slam on their brakes and drive 20 under the 55 MPH limit as soon as they see “welcome to tourist town.” 

Had a guy pass me in a no passing zone after tailgating me for a while and then he sped up to probably 60 MPH. Cop saw the whole thing and pulled him over, and it was the most satisfying thing to wave at him as I drove past."

My SO, on the other hand, I guess didn’t learn the same lesson I did. It’s taken a lot of work to get his teeth in better shape. Thankfully he has great dental insurance so it’s not costing him much if anything. A waterpik and an electric toothbrush are one time investments that can help tremendously especially if your teeth are cavity prone (mine are not). My dad also swears that using listerine twice a day is the reason he’s never had a cavity at almost 60 years old."

The ceremony started at I wanna say 11-12 and was only 30-45 minutes, but the reception didn’t start until 3 (or maybe even later) and was really far away from the church (which wasn’t even a church with significance to the families). We ended up stopping at McDonald’s with a group of people after getting close to the reception hall and hanging out there for over an hour since we missed lunch. Then when the reception started they didn’t serve dinner right away so we were so thankful we ate lol. 

Another thing I can think of is a wedding I attended where they had an open bar, but only during cocktail hour. So one single hour of open bar, and everyone was trying to get as much alcohol that they would need to last the night. There was also no food at the cocktail hour, so people were wasted by the time dinner started an hour later lol."

It would be completely different if your 30 year old sister was dating a 41 year old because they would probably both be out of school and well into their careers and at basically the same place in life.

It’s actually refreshing to hear from these people because they realize what needs to be done to lose weight and admit that they are the cause of their own obesity. If you ask me why I gained so much weight I would tell you that I stopped exercising and ate too much pizza rather than trying to blame it on health issues.

If OPs girlfriend can not afford to pay for her cat’s medical bills if something were to happen it is smart for her to have insurance.

Feliway diffusers are also not a pyramid scheme and can be very helpful to cats, btw.

fatlogic,fdksaq5,t1_fdkmz0z,1578510112.0,No one takes the liquid calories into consideration as if they don’t count. I rarely expend my daily calorie limit on non-diet or alcoholic drinks because I’d rather consume those calories in food.
MealPrepSunday,fdkonfy,t1_fdkf18r,1578507938.0,I have a company credit card and they allow us up to $50 for dinners “no questions asked.” Lunch is always provided by the company. You better believe everyone spends $49.99 at every dinner 😂
Insurance,fdko42j,t3_elto70,1578507615.0,"Based on your prior post, it sounds like it may have been a word vs. word situation. In that situation, it makes sense that the other carrier found you to be at fault and doesn’t necessarily mean your own carrier agrees. 

Just give the adjuster a chance to get back to you. You need to have patience because your claim is not the only one he’s working, and pestering him by sending him multiple emails isn’t going to help the situation."
fatlogic,fdh7tam,t1_fdey2dz,1578417243.0,"I agree that it’s a reminder and not shaming. It’s also very helpful to have someone encourage you to keep going rather than try to get you on board with cheating on your diet. I always ask my SO to encourage me to keep going on my diet, exercise and even other areas of my life because it’s so much easier to have him doing that than for him to be apathetic if I want to cheat."
AmItheAsshole,fdh72hj,t1_fdetox3,1578416784.0,"Why are you so invested in your wife’s hair care routine? If you asked my SO how often I wash my hair, what products I use to style it and how long it takes he would have no clue because he doesn’t supervise me while doing it."
Insurance,fdfdzcm,t3_el0zu7,1578359464.0,"I don’t think any one carrier is more or less likely to pay a first party claim. I’ve come across some that give people a hard time for 3rd party claims, but in general companies like to keep their customers satisfied by paying claims as soon as possible if no red flags are raised. 

Typically when I see insureds upset about claims not being paid it’s because they didn’t know what type of coverages they were purchasing. Insurance companies can only pay for something where coverage exists. I would recommend contacting an agent to discuss your needs and find the best company."
MealPrepSunday,fdfd2oc,t1_fdf5jr4,1578358847.0,"I thank past me all the time, but I also like to make life more difficult for future me. At least once a day I push an assignment at work ahead and say, “that’s a problem for future me.” 😂"
fatlogic,fdfctf1,t3_ekyc09,1578358672.0,"Ugh, my parents recently lost their extremely overweight dog and you could tell he was in pain and suffering. He was supposed to weigh something like 17 pounds but was 36 at his highest. My parents were able to get him down to 27. He lived to be 14, but had all types of issues like pancreatitis. He was always sick and constantly whining. I have dogs that are known for their fatness, and we are always monitoring what they eat and their activity levels to make sure they maintain a proper weight."
AmItheAsshole,fdeq4wx,t3_ekxcfb,1578344281.0,"YTA. Curly hair requires a lot of maintenance. I know multiple people who thought they had frizzy/messy/sort of straight hair for their entire lives before they put some product in and realized it’s actually curly but needs product in order for the curls to form properly and look nice. 

On the other hand, I have super straight hair and I still spend an hour drying and going over it with a straightener to make it look decent. 

I’m also willing to bet that she doesn’t wash her hair on a daily basis, so she’s spending an hour every few days or even once a week vs. daily."
Insurance,fd6lk47,t1_fd2ja54,1578192778.0,"The best part was that we had probably 8 adjusters in my department. Three of the claims came to me and the rest were scattered among the others since they just auto assigned. I always worked my new claims immediately, so I was the first to call and got the pleasure of explaining he will have to pay 3 deductibles since he had filed 3 claims. Then I realized he actually filed 12 lol. 

He ended up withdrawing them all, but he thought he had found some insurance loophole like he was super smart."
Insurance,fd2b082,t3_ejwd2d,1578144535.0,You’re being super paranoid. They want to know what you saw. Most likely trying to determine if he was distracted or driving erratically.
Insurance,fd2atz2,t1_fd0odjw,1578144449.0,I had an insured file 12 claims at one time for scratches all over his vehicle from it being parked on the street. He even kept track of the different dates the damages were caused. He said he was waiting until there was enough damage to make it worth paying his deductible.
Insurance,fd2ai42,t3_ejss1v,1578144280.0,"Yes, you reported the claim and say my insured is at fault, but no I won’t pay the claim without speaking with them first. I’m certain you’d be angry if your insurance carrier settled a claim without speaking to you first. 

Yes, we insure the car and person involved in the accident, but that doesn’t mean we will pay your claim if they were driving for Uber because of the policy exclusions. 

Also, no amount of whining, complaining or making things up will get me to change my liability decision when you are clearly at fault. Not happy I accepted liability because you caused a chain reaction accident? I don’t need a 3 min voicemail about how the other person was (stopped) too close to the vehicle in front of it. Did you enter an intersection into the path of a car traveling the right of way because you didn’t see it? Don’t try to say the other vehicle was speeding, texting or my favorite - distracted by beautiful Christmas lights. How do you know if you didn’t see the other vehicle?

Also, adjusters don’t set rates or cancel your policy. And when you call me to complain about it and I direct you to the agent or underwriter, don’t continue to go off on me about it."
AmItheAsshole,fcvofle,t3_ej1n0f,1578006501.0,"NTA, no one in my office takes leftovers until everyone has had a chance to eat. I’m fact, we usually leave them until the next day and whatever is left in the fridge is free game.

I’ll take food home for family, but not until I’m absolutely certain everyone has gotten their fill."
AmItheAsshole,fcsle3n,t3_eiawtt,1577918986.0,"NTA, my dogs don’t even mind fireworks and we did go out last night, but I regretted it because I missed them and I would’ve had a nicer night hanging out at home with them. I already plan to stay in next NYE lol."
pettyrevenge,fcr8hki,t1_fcp90zk,1577898318.0,"Even if there is a witness that can confirm a vehicle was brake checking liability would fall on the rear vehicle for not maintaining a safe following distance in every state I’ve handled claims in. 

I tried to place liability on the front vehicle once only because there were witnesses and the front vehicle driver was cited for stopping on a dime from highway speeds to randomly let some passengers out on the side of the road. I still didn’t win that argument because the other vehicle wasn’t maintaining a safe distance."
CasualConversation,fcqznk2,t1_fcqknby,1577894602.0,I used to live in an area where long term residents started experiencing cancer at alarming rates and there were tons of issues with the water. It looked fine coming out of the tap but would change to a really gross yellow color and leave sediment in the glass. I just got used to buying bottles because I didn’t even trust a Brita filter lol. Now that I’ve moved drinking bottled is a habit I’m trying to break because it’s hard to convince myself the water here is perfectly fine.
Insurance,fcqyfxr,t1_fcos5w4,1577894095.0,Oof...I once had a claim reassigned that was being handled by a subro rep. She didn’t think to reassign it the 4 times she received a letter of rep or the 3 times she received demands over 6 months. She finally reassigned it on like day 7 of a 10 day time limit.
AmItheAsshole,fcndj3p,t3_ehzueu,1577809423.0,"NTA - I run across a lot of...interesting...names in my line of work. Think someone named Baby Girl and a person whose first name is literally just “Mr.” The name you chose is nowhere near as offensive to me as those, and he has some great nickname options if he prefers to use one in the future."
AmItheAsshole,fcl3yoj,t3_ehob2q,1577739291.0,NTA I don’t understand who would even want to be in someone’s bridal party that they don’t like. Being a bridesmaid usually entails spending time with the bride (not the groom).
intermittentfasting,fckvaed,t3_ehlcmw,1577733956.0,You both have done an awesome job! When my dog was a puppy I used to walk him for 2-3 hours everyday after work and on weekends. I started to gain weight after I cut down on our walks in favor of taking him to the dog park because I just sat there and watched him play. My dog is seriously ripped and I gained 20 pounds 😂
airfryer,fckulia,t3_ehom1u,1577733526.0,"We make these all the time in our air fryer. I actually made a dozen last night. My SO is hard to please in the wing department, and he said they’re the best he’s ever had."
