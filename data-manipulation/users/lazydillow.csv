EatCheapAndHealthy,ff30xp1,t3_eqyu6y,1579530735.0,"Maybe this has been said already, but buying local, seasonal veggies really ups the excitement (and taste!) factor. Maybe there is a farmers market near you or a farm or food hub that has a CSA (weekly produce share). 

This will probably be a little more expensive than shopping at the grocery store but a lot of people find that it helps them cut down on food waste. When you are getting something super fresh harvested by a farmer you know, you are just more likely to feel compelled to use it. It can inspire you to try new things and actually make veggies the star of the show.

Local veggies will undoubtedly be fresher and therefore tastier -- sugars start coverting to starches after harvesting, so there's a big taste difference between something harvested yesterday vs 2 weeks ago.

You won't fall into a broccoli-every-day rut because broccoli will only be available a short time. If you are open to it, you will be able to taste all sorts of new veggies and heirloom varieties. 

Even if you live somewhere it gets cold in winter, you might be surprised to find that farmers are growing year round using green houses and such."
Kombucha,ff2yql4,t3_ercqbd,1579528882.0,"Kombucha is actually pretty easy to make and I do like to drink it fora pick-me-up at work. You need a SCOBY (the ""mother"") which you can make yourself or purchase online ... or get from an aquaintance... The mother constantly makes ""babies"" so people are usually eager to give them away. 
To make kombucha you make a strong black tea with sugar, add the culture and then let it go through 2 fermentations... Might take a couple weeks til it is done. 

It takes a little dedication but so much cheaper than purchasing."
