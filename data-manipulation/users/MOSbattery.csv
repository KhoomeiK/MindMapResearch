I don’t feel any pressure from anyone possibly thinking negatively about me. Also protecting your energy from others is important or else you just don’t feel as strong if you give it out while in conversation or touching someone. Feel as if your energy is in a bubble and is only for you to have. Also remember, we are all humans (I hope) no one is more important or on a higher level than anyone else we are all on the same playing field no matter what title the matrix says you have.
