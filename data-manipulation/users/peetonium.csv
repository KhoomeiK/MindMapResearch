aww,fd3tedy,t1_fd3t8ul,1578161468.0,Yep.  Basically a true story.  Sweet
aww,fd3qisb,t1_fd3nvn6,1578160830.0,"Seems like its pretty much true but slightly off.  Snopes says its miscaptioned but then goes on to confirm the two were indeed friends.  The photo is from Turkey, and the pelican and dog hung out a lot and were friends.  All in all i like it!"
Stronglifts5x5,fd1q4o1,t3_ejiiue,1578135065.0,Im also curious why you kept looking to the left.  Not a big deal but dont make it a habit.
Stronglifts5x5,fd1pixs,t3_ejqok4,1578134789.0,Looks like on the way down your knees are breaking too soon.  Causes the bar to angle out then come back.  Bad camera angle to judge but seems apparent.   Check out some youtube videos for tips on addressing this.  Good luck
business,fcup04z,t1_fcunjlj,1577985620.0,I believe something like 70% of US cropland by acreage is used to produce food for livestock.  Seems hugely inefficient....
wholesomememes,fcpciuu,t1_fcpc1hk,1577858268.0,"Lots, maybe most, animals are farmed.  My neighbors dont keep them as pets and neither do i.  I personally dont like to call them farm animals because i personally dont believe they are only properly classified as such.  Kind of semantics but i think its inportant to keep in mind they are animals in a way that is absolutely no different than horses, dogs, cats etc"
wholesomememes,fcpc7rx,t1_fcpc0mx,1577857936.0,"Not a shitty generalization.  About 85% of beef cattle spend most of their lives in giant feedlots.  Im the US thats mostly in Texas, Nebraska, Kansas and a few other states.  MASSIVE commercial operations.  The other 15% is your ""whole wide variety"".  Theres definitely a movement for more responsible raising and slaughtering of farm animals, but its small beans compared to the vast majority of commercial operationsm."
wholesomememes,fcpbthk,t1_fcpbixy,1577857521.0,"They are bred to be productive (meat or milk).  They are not bred to be farm animals, whatever that means.  Same for chickens, tomatoes, corn and dogs long ago and some still today.  Plenty of my neighbors have all of those on their land and they definitely dont have farms.  My point to the previous post was that theyre just animals.  Farm or not. And theyre definitely not dull, mindless meat machines.  Though its easy to see them that way under typical conditions (ie feedlot)."
wholesomememes,fcpagpk,t1_fcp8y16,1577856141.0,"Theyre not dull, theyre imcredibly inquisitive.  Yea theyre haeavy, dont bring them into the parlor.  Like just about every animal they shit and piss.  Theyre not farm animals, theyre animals.  Farm animals are typically raised and kept in barely acceptable conditions, most in insanely unacceptable conditions.  Observed in more natural conditions theyre interesting and friendly critters who actually do make great pets."
