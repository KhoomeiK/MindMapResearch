aww,fgkqy60,t1_fgkiazt,1580871645.0,"Backing this up with some personal experience. 3 years ago my mum was looking for a cat that was similar to her old cat that I grew up with who had passed the year prior. she was a calico/tortie with an orange stripe on her nose. We found a kitten at a rescue shelter that looked just like her and they held her for us. When we went to go meet her, I was looking at the other kittens, her siblings, and we found this tiny little tabby cat with big 'ol ears and a playful spirit. She would *not* leave my side. She clung to us. She loved us. The people at the rescue were only making us pay $50 for the cat we went there for (whom we named Callie, naturally). When she saw how enamored I was with this Tabby (whom we named Jade), she said we could adopt both for free. Carrier provided, cat food provided, treats provided, all the shots and future vet appointments free. We took both of course.  

We noticed when we first met the cats that Callie was super shy and to herself. It was like she didn't know how to be a cat even though she was born in the shelter with a bunch of cats. Jade was wild though. She was so playful and loving. The minute we got home she would play like crazy! Callie just didn't know what to do, so she just tried copying Jade. She learned SO much from her!! They were inseperable, and whenever Callie was on her own or couldn't find Jade she would cry and cry. Jade always came running to her calls, even if she was sleeping in a corner of the house. She would immediately get up and go to her and cuddle her until she was all better and ready to play. 

We had Jade for 2 years, and then she got sick in late December early January. She tried hiding it from us, and she did her best because we caught it too late. She had a tumor in her back leg and stomach area. The vets nearly missed it even though it was large. We had to put her to sleep because of how much it had grown. I stayed with her and she kept nuzzling me as if to say it was okay. She rested her head in my hands, gave me the most loving eyes, a kiss, and then she was gone. Callie was confused for the next few days because she didn't know where her sister had gone. I think she seemed to understand though, by the empty carrier and our sad faces. But she returned to her playful spirits in order to keep us happy. 

Point of the story is that Callie would not be who she is today if we had not gotten Jade alongside her. Callie would be quiet, calm, and shy. Instead, Callie is the most playful talkative queen of the house cat we've ever had. She *loves* people and is amazing with kids and I'm so happy that Jade taught her how to be who she is. She was an amazing girl, both of them are. Adopt two cats. They really do need each other. I promise you that."

Called my boyfriend to get him to come kill it, and he laughed and said he couldn't and was sorry. Called my mum, but she was out of town with my stepdad. Then I remembered that my brother lives down the street, so I called him and he very thankfully came over just to kill this stupid bug for me and then went home.

AskReddit,fg8ks9y,t3_exj2an,1580622655.0,"I don't think I ever did. I tell myself that I'm fine now, that I'm better, but I know it will haunt me for the rest of my life. I lost my dad when I was 11, about to turn 12. This was in 2012. He took his own life. I was extremely close to him, almost inseperable. Because of that, I spent my entire teenage years hating myself and him and not hating him at the same time, wondering how he could do this to me and how he could just leave me behind. Eventually I stopped hurting. The days that hurt most were his birthday and the day he did it. It will be 8 years in June and it still hurts. 

I think the most self destructive thing you can do is to live for them in some way. I did that, and I still do it, and I wish I could stop because I know it's not helping. I always tell myself that if I do this thing then dad will be proud of me! And then when I do the thing, I hate myself because he wasn't there to see me accomplish it. He wasn't there when I graduated, he wants there when I got accepted into University, he wasn't there to meet my boyfriend, and he won't be there when I get married or have kids or get a job I truly love. People always say ""they'll be there in spirit!"" And I always want to say ""Spirit isn't good enough."" Live for yourself, make yourself proud. Become who you want to become for *you*. You don't owe your life to anybody. 

My advice would be to seek therapy. I never did. We couldn't afford it. Because of that I fucked up my entire life and I'm just now having to deal with what the pain had caused. Clean up the mess. I can't sweep it under the rug when it's in the air, but I can at least try to get it out and make it fresher. Therapy will help you just clean up the mess before it can evolve into a dumpster fire that just won't go out. And if therapy isn't working, then write it all into a journal. Describe in detail how you feel. The memories you shared. Stories. Let your tears fill the pages. Then just set it on fire. Who cares if it's embarrassing information or if it seems too sensitive? Nobody but the wind will know what the ashes meant to you. You'll forget what it all said in a few days. 

Most importantly, *let yourself grieve*. Give yourself time to cry, to feel pain. Don't let anybody tell you that you cannot grieve. You're human. You're allowed to feel whatever emotions that you feel. You don't have to justify yourself to anybody. Cry your damn eyes out. Scream. Punch the hell out of a pillow. Buy a stack of blank paper and tear it all to shreds and make a mess of it on the floor. Hell, get some cheap plates and take it to a junk yard and smash the hell out of that glass. Do whatever you can to feel something that doesn't involve harming yourself or others. *Feel*. *Grieve*. *Breathe*. Then, when everything settles, and you've felt like you've dried your eyes out, go to sleep. Take every day after that slowly. It's okay if you spend a week crying in your room, so long as you take care of yourself. Know that they loved you, and they cared about you so much, and that they probably hate themselves for making you feel this way. But also know that you'll get through it with time if you let yourself. Don't rush yourself, but don't destroy yourself either. Reach out. I guarantee you that you are not alone. 

The world is going to keep turning. Life moves on. It's going to do these things whether you move with it or not and it isn't going to wait for anybody. So you might as well move with it. But turn at your own pace."
AskReddit,fg8ir1r,t1_fg8hn9w,1580620761.0,"I was like, 13 at the time. Every weekend I'd go to my friend's house and we would sleep in her basement with the big TV and Wii and just play Mario kart or donkey Kong all night. Whenever we played Mario Kart, it would be extremely intense. It's important to note that we would play the games by sitting on swivel chairs from her dad's office. We would also have our blankets wrapped around ourselves because this is Canada and Winters make houses cold as fuck. 

So, here we are having an intense match of Mario kart on a cold Friday night with our blankets wrapped around ourselves. We're on the final match, and it's Rainbow Road. We are drunk off juice boxes and chips and we are living life, it's a close game. I won by an inch. First place in every race, and I won the cup. I'm excited. She's upset. I throw my arms up in celebration, both hands have a corner of the blanket balled up in them. Little did I know that the bottom of the blanket was tightly caught in the wheel of this swivel chair from 1989. Because I pulled the blanket above my head, I lifted my chair up and fell backwards, slamming the back of my head onto the basement floor that is cement with a thin layer of carpet over it. 

I have no memory of falling. I just remember being in the chair and then being on the floor laughing my ass off. My friend didn't know whether to freak out or laugh with me so she did a bit of both. Apparently the contact from my head hitting the floor was loud enough for her parents to hear from *upstairs*. I yelled that I was okay, and I got up and just laughed it off. My head was perfectly fine, I felt great. Until about three hours later when I got the worst headache of my life and I felt like I was spinning. I figured it was nothing, I get headaches all the time, so we went to bed. Woke up in the middle of the night still super dizzy with a headache and a nose bleed. I felt sick. Did a quick search and found out I had every symptom of a minor concussion, so naturally I told my mother over text. She asked me if I needed to go to the hospital and I said I was fine and went straight back to bed. I was a bit out of it for the next few days but then I was fine. 

No one ever believes the story. My friends made fun of me for it for years. It was my first ever concussion and probably my only one and it's my favorite story to tell because it happened in the most stupid way possible. Everyone gets a concussion from sports or something but here I am getting a concussion from coming in first at fucking Mario Kart."

AskWomen,ffsra7l,t3_euxp0j,1580189658.0,"I have two older brothers. I haven't spoken to the one closest to my age (5 years older), but I speak to the one who still lives in my city, he's the oldest brother. When I was 11 my dad passed away and I took it extremely hard, as I was super close to him. It caused issues for me as I got older cause I never had therapy for it, we couldn't afford it. Both of my brothers always looked out for me, and whenever my mum and I argued they always had my back. 

My oldest brother told my mum after he got his first job that if I ever needed anything – literally anything at all – he'll pay for it. He told her that he wants to spoil me because he wants to be the best big brother and I deserve it. I tried to not ask him for things, because I didn't want to seem like I was just using him. But if I ever mentioned wanting something he'd ask me how much and then offer to buy it outright for me or to go halfers with me. I'm in University now, and in my first year I had a really hard time paying for my winter term. I wasn't able to save enough from my job and I couldn't get a loan from the bank. I had late fees, and what was supposed to only be $1900 turned into $3000 owed. At some point the university just stopped charging me I guess. But it was just before fall term registration and I was extremely worried I wouldn't be able to go back to school, and it was making me depressed. My brother ended up asking me how much it was, and when I told him he immediately e-transfered me the exact amount. Told me not to worry about paying him back until it's completely possible for me to, and when I am then to only pay him $1000 of it, and it's okay if that doesn't happen until I'm graduated. Turns out he doesn't buy much with his paycheques from work, and will only upgrade his computer from time to time, but other than that he just saves it all which is how he was able to drop three grand on me and still be totally okay. He'd been saving for years. Even after that he still buys me games if I really want them but can't afford them at the moment. 

I'm extremely grateful for them, and I miss my second oldest brother so much. I grew up with them, and they completely shaped my personality and helped me become who I am today. I have no idea where I'd be without them and I love them to death."

Let me tell you a thing about moose. They're. Fucking. Massive. I have a lot of online friends down in the states and in the UK who always ask me if moose are really that big, and I always tell them this: if you think someone is over exaggerating the size of a moose, BELIEVE THEM. THEY ARE NOR OVER EXAGGERATING. These motherfuckers are giant. They're so fucking strong too. I think the record size is about...1800 pounds? And it was about 7.3ft tall at the *shoulder.* They are the second tallest mammal in North America. 

Let me tell you another thing about moose. You never want to see one at night. Not only do most of the roads here not have lights, but you probably still wouldn't catch a fucking moose in time even if there were lights. If you do see one and it's just chilling on the road, let it. Wait for it. Who cares if you hold up traffic. I have a feeling all moose in the world give zero shits about anything and anyone, because I have major doubts that they would even move if you honked at them. And on the off chance that you DO honk at them and they get *pissed*, you might as well have just dug your own fucking grave because those fuckers will kill you and then show up to your funeral and probably kill your family and the attendees. 

Now, I'm not saying they're aggressive. They don't care at all about anyone, like I said. Well, they don't care until you give them a reason too anyways. Like how another reply here mentioned how a bull fucked up their truck a few days after they killed the mate by accident, so I'm pretty sure they hold a killer grudge.

We did truth tables and proofs but it was mostly just definition and breaking down arguments, or knowing fallacies and Mills logic. We had one assignment and it was an easy A. You were allowed to discuss the assignment with peers so we all helped each other with things we didn't know. I believe we had three tests, the assignment, and then the final, and your lowest test mark gets dropped. Everything was worth 20% and the final exam was worth 40%

He does PHIL 1200 online and its entirely essays but it's a lot of reading."
