Anxiety,ff6hxsj,t3_ermpo1,1579627579.0,"Congratulations on conquering your fear! I was terrified of giving presentations when I was young. A few things helped me to the point where I have healthy anxiety only beforehand. First, people don't generally notice when your voice cracks or other little signs of being nervous. Second, the more you present, the more comfortable you will become. Third, the more you know about your subject, the more comfortable you will be. Preparation and experience are your friends.

I actually like presenting and training people now. You may eventually even become really good at presenting and enjoy it. Good luck!"

addiction,fekuzeo,t1_fekqt5q,1579208146.0,"Apparently, part of it was that a ""treatment plan"" had to be submitted. There was no ""treatment plan"" to submit since it was for post-surgical pain. It was a new rule that no one was aware of. There was much confusion between the pharmacy and doctor office. 

I'd advise anyone planning a surgery to try and get the prescription filled ahead of time, if possible. Post surgery is not the time to be running around trying to fill a prescription that's difficult to fill."

As is often the case, the masses who need this medication for wisdom tooth extractions, surgeries and other types of acute pain have had their lives made much more difficult by a few who are abusing the system. It is now very difficult to get pain medication for surgery; to the point where it is a good idea to keep a few pills on hand at all times in case the need arises. I've had it take up to two days after a major surgery to get pain medication from the pharmacy due to new rules and red tape that neither the doctor or the pharmacy knew about."
