offmychest,fchq00x,t1_fcho1gj,1577652896.0,"The doctors have diagnosed me with BPD. It makes sense really thinking back on my crazy past 5 years. I wish I could just quit this, but it's all on me to do well and succeed for my family. My great nans dying wish was for me to succeed in London and do well in my degree, my mother right now and my family is very poor back home, my mother isn't even eating some days and it's all on me to do well and get wealthy and then get a better life for my family. It's all so stressful, I'm literally losing my hair already from all of this. I don't have a choice morally. I need to stay here and succeed, especially for finance. No other city bar London is worth speaking in the UK for finance. I need to tough it out here, it's my only option other than suicide.

I need my family to be happy, and then me to be happy and maybe be with someone and live a nice life, financially secure and maybe have a house. That to me is satisfaction."
offmychest,fchkxju,t1_fchjoiu,1577651433.0,"The thing that would make me happy is being satisfied Nd having a normal life. I've been like this not just this year but since I was about 14. I've tried and tried, I've seen about 3 different counsellors now and have co-operated with people by taking myself into hospital. It never seems to get better. I've been suicidal for years now deep down but it's only this year I've started cracking and attempting.

I don't blame anyone else per say. I blame myself and punish myself as such when I fail. As I did today.

Thank you for the first message that makes sense though here."
offmychest,fch4g7f,t1_fch45cj,1577647213.0,"Fuck this, I thought Id get some conversation here I couldnt get anywhere else but all of you are talking in fucking cryptic messages. I seriously dont know what the fuck any of you are on about."

casualiama,fbgwrg8,t1_fbg7y5o,1576860359.0,"Tried to overdose in an attempt to kill myself, the original plan had been to get super glue from a store, come back and superglue a plastic bag to my head and then superglue my hands together to prevent my instincts making me take the bag off.

However I had been up for about a day and a half at that point and hadn't eaten, I had no energy. So instead in a desperate attempt as I wanted it to end right that moment, i took all fhe medication i had in my room. Which amounted to about 12 sertraline pills and 4 paracetamol.

It didn't work obviously, wasn't even enough to give me serious damage, but it was enough to give me a hell of a bad time."
