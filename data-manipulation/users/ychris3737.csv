This though is actually something everyone needs to hear, even if you have no problem with dating and regularly go on dates. Recently I was so whipped about this girl I met that I dropped a couple hundred bucks on the first date and had a great time, we had a great time and she even asked me to stay the night. Despite all that, we never went on a second date and don’t even talk anymore. So, last piece of advice is definitely useful.

It’s really easy to take it personally and give ultimatums because you feel like you are always initiating contact and their action (or rather lack of action) and reciprocation is isn’t matching up with their words, but take a step back and take the sign for what it is. It doesn’t have to be anyone’s fault, maybe she’s just going through shit that you don’t know about, maybe she changed her mind, maybe she doesn’t know what she wants, maybe she felt like your feelings were too intense, maybe she felt like you’re a lot more ready than she is, whatever the case, no need to justify, no need to blame, no need to define right or wrong.

Although I do feel like modern dating is so much about not getting hurt, not getting attached, protecting yourself and taking it slow, all great things, but done to an extreme, at least it seems that way from everyone I meet, that nobody really feels anymore. 

But I do believe most people are capable of feeling and expressing love and did so at one point in their lives but then something bad happens in a relationship or relationships over time that makes them adopt those new “rules” to dating that are overly cautious to the point they’re basically psyching themselves out of good things instead of governing themselves with those rules to cultivate healthy relationships. It’s quiet sad actually. It’s almost as if we spend all our lives trying to “be better” but really we’re just trying to get back to who we used to be when we were innocent enough to love and trust freely without fear of rejection or disappointment. In a way, we’re not becoming something new, but trying to find our ways back to who we were, someone who was capable of loving and feeling love without all the doubts and distrust."

You didn’t offer any immediate solution and quiet frankly nobody can, BUT your confirmation that I’m not in this alone and that we are in living in an age where how we define and go about finding love and relationships is morphing so much, is enough of an reassurance to at least make me feel OK for today.

A lot of times all we need to know is that we are exactly where to need to be, and that as long as we steer our ship with good intentions, discipline and virtue, eventually good things will find us. 

Although I’m curious what you think the value in taking a break is. I took a year away from dating just because I had a lot to work on and my career was going through a transitional period, but now I am 100 times better than the person I was even 2 years ago, and yet everyone I meet now is nowhere near the high bars set by my exes. It’s like I’m getting better, but meeting worse people... which is kind of infuriating.

What do you think the value is in taking a break from dating? I’m kind of an opportunistic guy and let it happen whenever because I don’t believe there’s ever a good/bad time especially when it comes to meeting people."
dating_advice,feab7xt,t3_eo5spx,1578946539.0,"Kind of related to what we were talking about on this post too. I think ultimately it’s about 1) finding and fixing your insecurities so that you’re happy alone without anyone 2) but not adopt a “I don’t want people around because being myself means I won’t get hurt” mentality and 3) knowing how to invest the right amount at the right time so you don’t give your everything at the sight of any love 4) but not adopt a “I’m afraid to invest because I’ll be hurt again so I’ll just not love even though I am capable” mentality.

It’s really about balance and it’s not easy but I think modern dating is really evolving a lot and changing how people think about love and companionship. At least know you’re not in this alone. Everyone struggles with love, some just reflect on it more than others. It’s a blessing and a curse.

dating_advice,fe9fj68,t1_fe910nh,1578937100.0,"That’s profound. Not just seek validations from others but from yourself, I guess I never thought about it that way.

I feel like it’s not that I don’t derive value and joy and validation from doing things that I want for myself. I do that quiet a bit actually. I’m completely happy on my own, have my hobbies and friends and really enjoy taking the time to do the things I love even if it’s by myself. The problem is whenever someone comes into my life, it just throws it off completely where I would let them occupy how I schedule my days/week, I would do things for them and less for myself, I would seek validation that I am valuable and appreciated more from them and less from myself.

I almost can’t help it. And like you said it usually leads to feeling unhealthy and rejected in the end. But part of me also questions if I even should change. It’s almost a good thing that very few people will actually appreciate about me, they can see that I am capable of being on my own but make a point and a conscious choice to prioritize them. Most just don’t happen to appreciate it and take it as signs of insecurities instead of affection and appreciation. That makes me think that by “changing” so that I no longer prioritize people, I’m going to protect myself for sure but also in the process get rid of a great quality that I think I have. And that’s kind of what happen to people as they get older, they become bitter and closed off, less kind and more protective because they adopt this protective mentality that doesn’t allow themselves to love like they know they are capable of.

I really do feel that. Someone once told me even after marriage and family, that nothing will ever be the same as the first real, true love where you two sacrificed so much and tried so hard despite signs that you probably shouldn't be together because we were just so innocent. What happens as we age is that we are less willing to compromise and less likely to forgive because we've been hurt and we've seen what people can do, so protecting ourselves becomes the priority rather than being vulnerable and feeling what you want to feel. You will fall in love again, just gotta meet the right person and have an open heart to receive and give just like you did. Aging makes a lot of us more bitter and cautious, necessary sometimes but not good for building relationships. Be ok with falling in love and giving and trusting and getting hurt again like you have never dated before, painful at times yes, but I think worth it too, and honestly perhaps the only way to find true love."

But at the same time I guess there is never a point where you're truly ""ready"" because just like all forms of self improvement, it's an ongoing thing and there's always room for improvement.

For me it's not so much feeling awkward in public but that I set my expectations so high for how much fun I should have and how well thing should go and put people on such pedestals that I just hope they enjoy spending time with me as much as I do with them that I always end up either really disappointed or feeling inadequate.

""Love yourself"" is easier said than done but it sounds like you're already  taking some steps to work on it. You're in therapy and try to put yourself in situations where you're forced to go out. I'm honestly thinking about getting a puppy too. A lot of times, caring for someone else who's vulnerable makes us feel useful and I think a lot of insecure people have a belief that we are not worthy of people's time or not good enough to be useful which can definitely be dispelled if you do the right things."

dating_advice,fdg55o6,t3_ektlxz,1578380426.0,"Great advice.
2 things.

1. You can be a great communicate and still ruminate and overthink and play the guessing game. We all do that to a degree. We are social creatures after all and are all insecure and emotional to a degree. I find people who don’t feel those things at all very apathetic, although they might never get too high or too low, it also means they experience things more like an even kill all the time. So embrace it, you feel things and you have emotions, don’t let it go haywire but embrace it.

2. Ask, don’t guess is great advice if you have an established relationship where there is a level of trust to allow for open communication. I would advice you think through what you might want to ask if it’s the beginning stages of a relationship because it can really trigger the other person and make them on edge if they are the type to overthink too and start making assumptions about your character. Ironically, thinking about whether you should ask something is playing the guessing game in itself, so the answer is really there is no right way of going about it. Be completely bold and ask whatever and be ok with the consequences no matter how bad, or overthink and ruminate because you don’t wanna ruin it and end up in a stressful, anxious state all the time lol.

dating_advice,fdczya9,t1_fdcprta,1578289449.0,"Yup. Be cautious and know how to love yourself and not fall for people blindly. BUT, that’s not to say don’t love or don’t trust people. People tend to adopt very extreme thinking when hurt. Statements like “screw all women” or “I won’t trust any man again”. I think the difficult thing to do is often also the right thing to do. In this case, it’s about still having faith in love and people and your way of showing love without letting people change you even if you know it doesn’t please everyone, ALL WHILE loving yourself and not giving so much that you lose yourself early on. :)"
careerguidance,fdczqh3,t1_fdcowot,1578289239.0,"Honestly, I actually think you need to be more qualified to work a corporate job. The typical tech corps really care about degrees, track record, past experience, where startups actually care a lot more about your character and work ethic, at least in my experience.

It’s definitely about meeting the right people and putting yourself out there. Luck is for people who are prepared right? I’ve bent over backwards before trying to get big corps to hire me and they wouldn’t. Looking back now, even if I did I get hired and jumped to corporate life, I wouldn’t have been happy. Startups tend to have less funding, less perks to offer, so they’ll be reasonable when it comes to who they hire and what they expect. Not everyone who joins a startups needs to bring money or crazy experience to the table, sometimes it’s just about the right match, just like dating.

It’s not about dating the hottest chick of the richest dude, it’s about finding someone whose values align with yours and most importantly who’s at a point in their life where you would fit in perfectly. Like for my startup, if they were 100+ people deep, and have the money to hire someone very senior, it would be hard for me to get in. On the flip side if they have no funding at all and can only pay entry level money, I probably won’t be interested. So much of it is really just luck and being in the right place at the right time."

careerguidance,fdbzp23,t3_ekjysu,1578264400.0,"Ive always been in small company/org settings (under 25 ppl), and last year joined a start up with less than 10. Honestly the most important thing is believing in the people and product. I think if you go into a startup to be comfortable or “milk the salary and benefits”, it’s definitely not the place to be. 

I haven’t felt like I’m burning out yet because 1) we keep the work environment very casual and friendly, it’s almost like working with your friends 2) the problem space we’re in and the product we’re working on is truly something I’m truly passionate about 3) I know I won’t do well in a corporate setting because I hate feeling stagnant or unimportant.

Of course with power and importance comes a lot of responsibilities as well.

Communication is important and it should be very easy in a startup because people are more personal and casual, so always communicate to your boss/co workers. Having work life balance is important, just because it’s a startup doesn’t mean you have to be on call 24/7, you’re not a emergency room surgeon. Be super productive when you’re working but forget about work when you’re not and take time to do your own thing. 

That’s all I can think about right now, hope it helped, best of luck."

relationship_advice,fdbsp3w,t3_ekchvl,1578261414.0,"I can only imagine how you feel my guy. Sorry that you had to experience this. One thing for sure is you shouldn’t try to be analytical right now, that’s a rabbit hole you’re not ready for so focus on just processing the emotions right now by stating facts to yourself.

She left not because you did something wrong, but because she wanted to. Too often we put the blame on ourselves when we lose something because we’re all insecure. Fact is that people do things because they do things and it has nothing to do with you, even if you’re spent a considerable amount of time with them.

Commitment can be scary for some people, and having a baby together is a huge step. I’d say it has the same effect as asking someone to marry you when they’re not ready to move on to that chapter at all, and even worse because another human being is involved. Some girls can’t even get themselves to commit to an exclusive relationship and end up breaking up out of fear, having a child is probably hundreds of times scarier than that.

People also dont always express what they feel or think. Or I guess most people. I don’t know how open your communication was but even if it was very healthy, she could’ve not told you everything. What people say they feel isn’t always what they actually feel, what people say they want to do isn’t always what they do. People are extremely good at hiding emotions.

I hope for now you can just come to terms with those facts first and know that it has nothing to do with you so remove yourself from the guilt and just take the time to grieve about the loss if you wish to. Feel better man, I don’t wish anyone to go through this."
dating_advice,fdbr2r1,t1_fda7mag,1578260581.0,"You took the words right out of my mouth man. Been self reflecting a lot lately because of this. At first I thought it’s because I tend to only see the good in people and put them on a pedestal before I even get to know them too well which leads me to having high expectations. But then I realized it’s just our personal attachment styles and it has a lot to do with our past experiences and upbringing. For me, I think I crave that feeling of safety with someone so much due to insecurities that as soon as I see the good in them, I let it all out and get too attached too quickly which can be too intense for some people. 

But it’s not necessarily a bad thing is what I also have realized. Just because they didn’t like it doesn’t mean there is something wrong with you. We can just be different as people, I experience and express emotions very intensely and scare some people away but that doesn’t mean I should change that about myself just to make them happy, that’s the ultimate mistake. It is a gift in a lot of sense, you just gotta find people who appreciate it. Hope that makes sense."
dating_advice,fdbpxfh,t1_fdbampr,1578260103.0,"This is definitely true. I would add that it’s ok if someone becomes your priority even if too quickly as long as they feel the same way and not only have expressed that but has shown it in their actions. Now if it’s clear at any point, even the smallest hint, that the person isn’t reciprocating back to you with the same urgency that you have for them, definitely have a balance and consciously keep yourself busy without them. I think we can sometimes be too cautious and restrain ourselves too much from love out of fear that we don’t actually allow ourselves to feel."

dating_advice,fd4r3rt,t1_fd4kvh2,1578170254.0,Yup that’s exactly what I do. And more often than not once we get talking I have a pretty good chance of not just going on a date but actually planning something fun and different and most of the time they seem really surprised and impressed. But there’s something about it that makes me feel like they almost can’t believe that someone put in such efforts into a date and don’t believe they deserve it or something and just kind of drift away and distance themselves despite saying how much fun they had and how much they look forward to getting to know me more. It’s just a lot of actions not matching words.
