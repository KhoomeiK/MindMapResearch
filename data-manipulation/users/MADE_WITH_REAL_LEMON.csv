AskReddit,ff4rf5w,t3_erhu3x,1579570636.0,"Yes, for example when I dream of my deceased love (young suicide in 2008).

At times in my life I've wanted nothing except these dreams, with waking up to reality being numbing and empty. 

In 2019 I started sending myself quick synopsis emails when I woke up.

There's a recurring one where I have a second apartment near where we lived in order to somehow still be near her in a way. And another where I enter our apartment and her things are mostly still hung in the same way in the rooms and closet.

Sometimes we talk for hours. Sometimes we talk about the dreams themselves. Sometimes she doesn't know that she's dead. Sometimes our families are there too. Sometimes they're just wild dreams. Sometimes she isn't present but it revolves around the grief. 

Here are some of the notes. I've redacted/changed from names to descriptors for anonymity. She is E.

Her parents visit. Talk with her mother in kitchen in morning while ppl getting ready about Russian writer purged. My mom self conscious doesn't like it. Says something. We drive out to work. Haven't showered. Orange bread her brother car jump police golf course drone kidnapper kiss officer falls down hill chase own kid afraid to lose her parents in living room talking about papa bday. I read something about E. Time to go play golf break down and cry holding her mother . My brother pull apart. Keep crying. Sister in (redacted location)

Come home to (redacted location). Group of people gathered. Man describing different parts of her. Bring her down on gurney under sheet. Turn backwards to get down the stairs. Manoeuver past them at bottom. He asks if it's really her. I stare him down but dont answer. Have to carry her around J and M""s boat which is blocking the path. Get her inside via the open front

Talking. I ask if she knows when I dream about her. She says no, how often? Every couple weeks. Paying attention to my dreams makes it harder for her to stay realive. People asking how we're doing as a couple, has to lie. How do we break up. I tell her about my apartment two blocks west of our old place. She asks why - to be near there. We drive northeast to a shittier part of town. Go to her apartment. Old colorful linoleum and tiles. View onto the street. Poor people walking around. Her landlord makes dinner for her. Her dog jumps on me. Tries to hump me. He has a boner it touches my arm.

Talked to C (her father). About dreams and talking with E for hours and realizing she's dead. Do you think you'll move in together? I hope so. He talked about how we are living in pretend world. Chatting with her about buying a house in Santa Clara. I'm nervous. Having doubts about committing to living in a life of make believe and giving up on loving a living person. Think about what it would be like to move to Santa Clara and introduce her to new people. Would they know? Her uncle arrives with carry on. Find a place with a long treelined driveway up a hill.

Studying in coffee shop type room. Song comes on. Go up to dj (friend, T?) and ask what it is. (redacted band name). ""wow, this takes me back 15 years"". Return to table, listen. Burst into heavy sobbing. Leave and go home cry in bathroom. Discolor beige toilet paper with wet spots. Someone comes in bathroom

Sometimes I think what if the afterlife is when the living still think of you, still dream of you? Your life after death continues in the livings’ thoughts and dreams. And when all who knew you or read about you have themselves died, then your afterlife is over. For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever. But what’s in it for you? Is there joy or any feeling in such remembrances? Do you get to know that you are still thought of? Does this mean anything to you? Are you able to interact with them in their dreams? Or are you merely kept available? What if you don’t want to remain in this state? Can you want at all? What about when the dreams and thoughts figure you in an incorrect way? Do you become this? And if the living have sexual dreams and thoughts about you, what of consent? 

But if this is the existence of the soul after life, what does that mean during life? If your existence after death is in the thoughts and dreams of the living who remember you, then is part of your life itself contained in the thoughts and dreams of others while you live? We don't care about the majority of times people think about us, such as a stranger passing on the street. But we appreciate when our beloved thinks of us. So their remembrances last a generation or two and we are then only remembered by the anonymous, if at all. But some take joy in fame."
