pureasoiaf,ffmu1su,t3_eu7zut,1580058899.0,"I'd go with a quote from Cersei herself, and a very different side to her-

""When we were little, Jaime and I were so much alike that even our lord father could not tell us apart. Sometimes as a lark we would dress in each other's clothes and spend a whole day each as the other. Yet even so, when Jaime was given his first sword, there was none for me. 'What do I get?' I remember asking. We were so much alike, I could never understand why they treated us so differently. Jaime learned to fight with sword and lance and mace, while I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, while I was to be sold to some stranger like a horse, to be ridden whenever my new owner liked, beaten whenever he liked, and cast aside in time for a younger filly. Jaime's lot was to be glory and power, while mine was birth and moonblood."" 

Maybe the most blatently feminist passage George writes, you could apply this kind of logic to so many people in the series and history. And not just in terms of gender, but in the whole system which gives people an automatic place in the world, not looking at their individual qualities. It is one of the greatest features of the mdoern age that this has changed (to an extent)."

Almost everyone understands that this sensitivity is important with race.

But these feminists use deliberately offensive language to refer to trans people, often while being very sensitive to any offensive language about women. Saying ""sex is natural"" in this argument either reflects ignorance or deliberate offensive.

Saw them at Reading Festival, they were headling, they didn't come out so we left, got back to our tents, then heard them start. It turned out they wouldn't get paid if they were an hour late, so they were 58 minutes late. So they only had half an hour on their hour and a half slot. They let them do an hour, even though they get a huge council fine for going late. When the sound was cut, Axl protested on stage and started playing acoustic (obviously pointless for 99% of us).

He's a genuinely terrible human being. He thinks acting the cunt is being a rock star."
