therapy,fe4tbss,t3_enqsvt,1578862609.0,"I can empathize, most of my sadness is in my chest. It's great that you are aware of the physical sensations and in tune with your body. There is a lot of info out there about somatic symptoms and ways to work through it.  

""The body keeps score"" gives a lot of insight into how the body stores trauma and how we know our emotions based on our physical sensations and different modalities researched to help.

 I would recommend seeing if your therapist will do Skype or if maybe there is a therapist around who specializes in somatic modalities. I personally have gained tremendous insight from internal family systems theory and EMDR, helping me work through my body's manifestations of emotions. 

Hang in there!"
selfimprovement,fe4qf77,t1_fe4pqo3,1578861869.0,Freedom from your inner critic is also a good one that focuses in on our inner critics from an internal family systems perspective. Has exercises in it as well
selfimprovement,fe4pqo3,t3_eno12m,1578861663.0,"""The body keeps the score"" amazing book about trauma and the body. Long but so insightful. Really helped me to understand why I do the things I do and what is going on in my mind and body. 

A heady but interesting book is ""internal family systems,"" it offers an interesting perspective on working with different parts of ourselves, like the part that gets stuck thinking about the past or the part that worries about the future or the part that fears what others think.  Instead of demonizing those parts it teaches how to seek understanding and work with those parts better. Made me way more accepting and understanding of myself and others."

askwomenadvice,fdd043c,t3_ekgml5,1578289605.0,"Honestly I thought for years I couldn't orgasm. I accidentally figured out I could by exercising. In order to orgasm I have to have my lower abs engaged, like I am doing a crunch. If my lower abs and kegel muscles aren't engaged nothing will work no matter what. When I masturbate I basically do a plank while rubbing my clit."

You too can start giving zero fucks!"
