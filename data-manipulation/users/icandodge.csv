JustUnsubbed,ff41x9a,t1_ff41lmn,1579553761.0,"...you're in this thread right now. The one that I'm talking about. Where did I lie 😂

So... being opposed to men viewing women as objects of sexual gratification is enough, in itself, to certify someone as an sjw feminist? I think any sane and normal person would be opposed to such a thing, but ok. And last time I checked I never caps-lock screamed that at anyone or cried about it like a ""typical sjw"".

Alrighty I'm done here. Have a good day."
JustUnsubbed,ff40joj,t1_ff3zjkf,1579552904.0,"I brought up those arguments because literally every single person I've come across who says shit like ""yikes at the slut shaming"" believes in that stuff. That women should be shielded from criticism, that women shouldn't be slut shamed whatsoever, that it's their body and their choice as to how they dress and what they do, and nobody can say shit about it.

I don't know how the actual FUCK I came off as an SJW to you because everything I'm saying is the exact opposite of what SJW feminists believe in these days. Instagram for example is an absolute cesspool of overly-liberal whiteknights who will crucify you for ""slut shaming"". I've had my fair share of encounters with those kinds of people and you strongly came off as one of them.

""You're acting like those ultra conservative religious people who freak out about premarital sex"" LMAO, I have to laugh. What a stupid comparison. Not even close. I have to remind you that you commented ""yikes at the slut shaming"" under a thread started by someone (who actually IS one of those r/twoxchromosomes users) calling me a ""stupid dumb slut shaming bitch"". Of course I'm going to come at you like you're one of them. Ffs.

And by the way - yea, anyone can wear what they want, but what I said is *be prepared to endure the criticism that comes with dressing certain ways*. You can't police how everyone sees you. That's policing human nature at that point. If I see someone, male or female, dressing in a very provocative and attention-whoring way, I will see them as slutty and/or immodest. The end."
joker,ff37x5o,t3_er9x3d,1579535807.0,Why is this being reposted so many times? I posted this photo when it first came out and all of a sudden everyone started reposting it. Worst part is my original post got buried while the reposts are getting all the attention. Fucks sake
JustUnsubbed,ff2ynpq,t1_ff2i2tp,1579528811.0,"""Yikes at the slut shaming"" ok feminist. Sluts exist, deal with it. Not everyone is modest. ""My body my choice!1!1"" sure, your body your choice what you do with it, but be prepared for the criticism that comes with wearing skimpy and provocative clothing all the time or sleeping around. Just because you're the owner of your body doesn't mean you're a good one. Not sure why women should be protected from any and all criticism. A lot of females (typically feminists) complain about being ""slut shamed"" yet they... act like total sluts and expect to be... what, praised for it? Sorry, I'm not into that shit. And when did I say that men aren't allowed to be attracted to women? Lmao. I said I hate how some men hyper sexualize women in their art like that and make them out to be these objects of sexual gratification."
JustUnsubbed,ff1hcac,t1_ff1eoe6,1579479233.0,"I mean, idk about the whole public shaming thing, but the rest I definitely agree with. This whole ""sex sells"" shit is just taken to an extreme in this society. Why do people obsess over sex and sexual things so much? It's so annoying. You see it everywhere.

I really like fight the new drug. You should look into them: https://fightthenewdrug.org/"
JustUnsubbed,ff13kq5,t1_ff12tda,1579474848.0,"Ok. I understand that. But what I'm saying is not nitpicky and it's been known for a while now that r/art always just upvotes anything to do with girls. I spoke up about it for the first time today and got banned for doing so. Fuck me, right? I'm such a gatekeeper. /s. It's enough to make me ultimately unsubscribe. That and their stupid rules like ""no fanart""."
JustUnsubbed,ff1048k,t1_ff0zyi2,1579473956.0,"You need to have been active in r/art for a while to know what I'm talking about. You can't base what I'm saying off the front page of r/art on one specific day. Top posts vary from day to day, and usually the top posts are exactly what I describe, the ones with thousands of upvotes. Also, this is a subreddit for posting about why you unsubscribed from a certain subreddit. People unsub for negative reasons, not positive ones... not sure why you come here looking for positivity?"
JustUnsubbed,ff0gw4i,t1_ff0fmru,1579468771.0,I agree with you 100%.
JustUnsubbed,ff0fw5z,t1_ff0fmrt,1579468524.0,"They aren't real women, you know that, right? They are portrayed as slutty-looking, provocative, vulgar, whatever the fuck you want to call it. I literally referenced r/mendrawingwomen in my original thread on r/art. I blame the men for how they portray women as these exaggerated-figure slutty looking objects. I'm not trying to be politically correct here, so get the fuck off my post, you stupid white knight."
JustUnsubbed,fezwo74,t1_fezwf3f,1579462636.0,"I'm a 17 year old girl, you dumb fuck. Are you serious? Lmao"
JustUnsubbed,fezwcbp,t1_fezuv6f,1579462507.0,THANK YOU! r/art is just a watered down dumpster fire at this point... I'm going to stick to smaller art subs like r/painting instead from now on. They're more focused on the actual ART aspect of things and it's actually a supportive community that offers tips and advice.
JustUnsubbed,fezuaq7,t1_feztrke,1579461744.0,"""You got 3 downvotes"" I got fucking banned and told that I'm ""everything wrong with the art community"" and that I'm just an angry gatekeeper. Yea, I'm fucking mad. All I did was express something that SO many other people in that thread expressed. And I get banned for it lmao. Good riddance my ass."
Art,fezrmij,t1_fezqt40,1579460764.0,"I'm not implying any of that. It can have weight, dumbass. There's some tasteful erotic art out there, but this just doesn't fit the bill of tasteful. This particular art style, drawing women like this, in suits that look painted on, totally exaggerated and obviously focusing on their tits and whatever else, IS cheap.  You can paint/draw women and men erotically and still make it tasteful. Would I say that those drawings of naked french girls in the titanic, for example, are the same as this? No, because one is actually in good taste. Would I say that renaissance paintings of naked women or men are distasteful? Again, no, because it's not the same."
Art,fezme8a,t1_fezly31,1579458973.0,"You said ""hopefully this fits your definition of real art"" in such a way that makes it sound rather snide."
Art,fezln4j,t1_feziggd,1579458684.0,"If someone's definition of real art includes overdone, generic ""sexy anime girl"" type of artworks, then they probably don't know what true art is. There's art, and then there's legitimate *art* that is made with meaning and passion, not just horniness and a desire to exploit women's bodies like this. As an analogy, it's the same kind of idea as the difference between, let's say, Justin Bieber type of fame and Paul McCartney type of fame. One is a celebrity, sure, he'll probably vanish into irrelevancey at some point - but one is a LEGEND. When I say ""real art"" I mean art that actually holds weight to it and isn't centered around something as cheap as sex."
Art,fezfdyz,t1_fezf09a,1579456780.0,"I want to see art with actual substance and meaning, not just these vapid, trite ""artworks"" of sluts all the time. It's in poor taste, it's basically just softcore porn eye-candy for thristy men to look at. Not to mention, real women look nothing like this (r/mendrawingwomen). Have some class. It's art, but it's shitty and perverse art. There you go."
Art,fezducz,t3_eqvag4,1579456319.0,Can we see something other than slutty girls upvoted on this fucking sub? It only ever gets upvotes because of thirsty men. Just make another subreddit called r/incelart or some shit where you can see this dumb stuff. I want to see real art not this bullshit.

joker,fel9jfs,t1_fel8se8,1579217023.0,"You said he's faking it, but then you also said he's actually losing it. Idk. Also you commented that under a post of Joaquin's Joker... just saying! ""Arthur was the monster"" ""society is horrible and they considered me to be a monster because I have asperger's"". Yea, and this world considered Arthur a monster for having mental illness and finally snapping after being the shit on the bottom of society's shoes for his whole life. Those two sentences in the same paragraph kind of contradict themselves to me. Society was horrible to poor Arthur who was just trying to get by in life and every fucking person treated him like absolute garbage, yet when he snapped, suddenly he's the big bad wolf? I disagree. I've been in a place so dark before that I completely empathize with the fact that he killed the people who hurt him. People can't just treat someone like shit until they can't take it anymore and then blame them for lashing out."
joker,fel4bo7,t1_fel24tm,1579213770.0,It needs to be said! Lmao
joker,fek7wgv,t1_fejuxlf,1579194459.0,"Don't compare fucking onision to joker. You clearly haven't watched enough videos about onision, because if you did, you'd know that he's faking all those ""breakdowns"" he's having and essentially making fun of mentally ill people by putting on this facade of ""going insane"". He is *trying* to play the insanity card. The joker would fucking hate onision and beat the shit out of him. Also, I don't think Arthur turned into a monster. I really don't. Society is the monster, not him. Call me crazy but those fucks deserved what was coming to them. Joker killed the people who did him harm. Onision is the one doing harm. He is not a victim. He is murray. Not joker. Also, last time I checked, joker wasn't into manipulating and grooming underaged girls..."

JustUnsubbed,fei73yw,t3_ep27r3,1579131756.0,r/depression is toxicity. I made a post there yesterday calling the entire subreddit out for it's bullshit. Got quite a bit of traffic and a lot of people were agreeing with me. I share your frustration.
rant,fehjmxr,t3_ep3blp,1579117894.0,"r/art pisses me the fuck off. I tried posting my painting of Joker there and it was removed because it counts as ""fan art"". So... a painting of Joaquin Phoenix is ok, for example - but Joaquin Phoenix as Joker? Removed, and told to post it on r/fanart instead, a MUCH smaller community. I contacted the mods telling them how these rules are pretty ridiculous and too uptight, they just responded by telling me that nobody cares about my opinion and that they're not going to change their rules for me. That's not why I contacted you, dumb fucks, I just wanted to let you know how shitty the sub is, and the rules that come with it restrict artists. All that is ever upvoted on r/art nowadays are paintings or drawings of ""attractive"" girls. I also messed up the title on a post earlier on r/art and took it down, reposted it with a corrected titled. Removed for ""making multiple posts"". You can only post every 2 days on there. Fuck reddit and fuck subreddit rules"

Plus, I'm 17 and currently have no means of moving out - but why the fuck should I move my entire place of living because of a loud dog and an inconsiderate owner that can't train it or bring it inside to not leave it barking it's ass off all morning? I reckon the logical solution would be for dog owners to be more respectful of other people and take better care of their mutts, not people moving houses due to some loud animals and bad owners."

All I want often times when I post is like ONE damn person to leave a comment offering some sort of relatability or a feeling of not being so alone, or maybe some advice. That's it.

There should be some component of support and trying to deter these feelings and thoughts, not just everyone agreeing with eachother that they all want to die. If there is no positivity (real positivity, not sappy twitter self care shit) it is toxic."
depression,fedzix9,t1_fedybkb,1579023181.0,"I'm 17. Depression and mental illness does not discriminate. Any one person can be targeted. I'm sure you know that already - but you say that as if being 15 invalidates them/means they don't know jack shit (which is true in most cases, however there some truly mature and intelligent youngins out there). I understand that older folks on this sub may not relate at all to the younger people posting on here - I actually empathize, as I've always felt out of place amongst my age group - however, this is a place for all ages and all situations. I saw a comment somewhere that a similar subreddit to r/depression but for older people might be beneficial and I agree."
depression,fedyw0z,t1_fedxt74,1579022804.0,"Thank you! I wish you all the best in your artistic endeavors. Art heals, trust me!"
depression,fedyrau,t1_fedy9pl,1579022725.0,"You're telling a 17 year old to kill themselves rn lmao. I smoke plenty of herb, thanks. But throw away all the life I have left to try and make something of myself? Hell fuckin nah. Take a hike if you're going to come here with this black and white attitude."
depression,fedy4bv,t1_fedx34g,1579022344.0,"Alright if you wanna be like that. I won't say ""nah it's not a solution at all"". I'll say, however, that killing yourself is a solution, but a terrible one, in the same way that, if there's a spider in your house, you can burn the entire house down and the problem will technically be solved, but did you *have* to burn the house down? I'd say no, you could've just killed that one spider somehow. Unless every goddamn inch of your walls are infested with spiders or cockroaches and there's truly no way to get rid of them, you don't have to burn your house down. But even then, burning the house doesn't have to be the answer, moving out could be. I like to speak in metaphors."
depression,fedxoas,t1_fedwg2l,1579022075.0,I will. I might look for some art-based meditation or therapy around here. Art is my passion and it can be incredibly therapeutic and relaxing. Even if you're not good at art or if you think you don't like it... painting simple things or doing pottery or music can be huge outlets.
depression,fedwzhi,t1_fedwhkn,1579021661.0,Thanks :) the movie hit home hard for me. It makes me feel better about myself. And for sure I think I might do that. I'll look for some sort of art-oriented outlet. Thank you for your support. This is what we need to see more of.
depression,fedwupq,t1_fedwn0a,1579021580.0,Yea no that's not a good thing to say.
depression,fedwaq3,t1_fedv5sh,1579021242.0,"Thanks. Yea, it's unfortunate that a lot of posts just end up getting buried. I'll look into some professional outlets."
rant,fedvw1e,t1_fedunk7,1579020999.0,LMAOOOO nice 😂
depression,fedvsbx,t1_fedvl93,1579020938.0,Thanks man. You seem chill. I like chill people. I'll follow you too. I also really like music and making it. Send me a chat if you're up to talk!
depression,fedvhxw,t1_feduvwo,1579020767.0,"Oh, I see. I paint (you can see some of my artwork on my profile lol), sing, play guitar, learning piano, I write, and I like photography. I'm trying to make it as an artist. I'll try that option if they take people who aren't in the school. Maybe I can try to find some sort of group meditation that incorporates art somehow?"
depression,feduvs8,t1_feduete,1579020401.0,"I'm not expecting an online community of mentally ill people to help me per se. I'm expecting a little bit of warmth, maybe less toxicity in this subreddit. Less of the same type of posts being the only things that are upvoted or brought attention to. Less people getting completely ignored."
depression,fedunlc,t1_fedsurq,1579020260.0,"I actually dropped out of school in 10th grade due to my mental issues (I have borderline personality disorder amongst depression and other things). I'm doing a GED now. Ever since I left school I've been very isolated and my social opportunities have significantly dropped. Being in school was hell, being out of school is another kind of hell. I'm not planning on attending university or college. I have to get off my ass and actually get back into the world more and find opportunities and resources to help me. I could find places online that offer group therapy and such. I'll try."
depression,feds379,t1_fedrpj9,1579018691.0,I'll check it out. Thanks man.
depression,feds1dp,t1_fedr314,1579018660.0,I haven't. I'm really apprehensive about it considering my massive social anxiety when it comes to group activities with people I don't know. I might consider it after I turn 18 in March but for the time being I don't think I can do it. The idea is overwhelming.
depression,fedqrhm,t1_fedpw5e,1579017862.0,"After having been through 8 therapists, some of which treated me like shit, some of which were totally useless, with no progress and to no avail, I don't *want* that kind of help anymore. Meds also fucked me up. I just want a supportive, productive community of people like me who actually give a shit about eachother and who don't just ignore every post on here that's genuinely asking for help or looking for conversation or something. ""Real"" support doesn't have to be paid for all the time nor does it have to come from a professional. Support is support no matter what form it comes in or who it comes from. I just wish this sub wasn't so fucking toxic. It's just a bunch of people wallowing in sorrow at this point with no intention of actually offering help to one another. Everyone just wants to be sad on here and that's it. How does that make anything better for people who are depressed, when communities meant for depression are nothing but cesspools of negativity and people getting drowned out and ignored when they make a meaningful post? I'm sorry if this comes off harsh but I'm fed up with being totally ignored everywhere I go and feeling like I don't exist even in a community that's meant for people like me"
rant,fedpe69,t1_fedoqtp,1579017007.0,"I'll check it out, haha. I'm gonna get ear plugs for sure, they're a good investment, I just haven't gotten around to getting them yet. Thanks!"
rant,fedo8yj,t1_fednqj7,1579016280.0,"I hate to sound mean or anything, I apologize if my comment came off as such. I've never had a dog (I am a cat person) so I'm not sure how to train one to bark less when they're let out or if you even can, I'm just throwing the idea out there, lol. And I mean 2-3 barks is fine, but when it's literally, like, rapid fire non-stop barking it can be quite bothersome. But at the same time they're just little furry buggers who don't know that they're being loud/disruptive, you can't blame them. But sometimes I just wanna tell the dog, ""bro, what are you barking at, nothing is even happening, chill out man"" lmao. Thanks for understanding my perspective as well"
rant,fedn5xl,t1_fedep1h,1579015586.0,"I mean, I get it - but at the same time, if you know how loud it is and that it bothers other people, why don't you take it upon yourself to train the dog to not be so incessantly loud when it's let out? If that's possible? Especially in the early mornings/late nights. I have a neighbor a bit farther down the road with an *extremely* loud dog that they let out every single morning at around 7:30am. The constant barking wakes me up and bothers me literally every day and I can't remember the last time I woke up peacefully."
joker,fect6ms,t3_eod7rx,1578983651.0,Nice job. Love the song choice - been listening to it a lot since I watched the movie.
