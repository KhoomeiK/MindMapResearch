This is a weird and illogical way to look at humanity and the world we inhabit. Everything is ""natural"" by virtue of it happening. Skyscrapers and iPhones are no less natural than bee hives and ants nests. We are animals living in a material (in the sense of ""physical"") world. We happen to be remarkable animals given our intelligence and capacity to build  uniquely complex things and societal systems, but everything we are and do is part of the natural world.

sex,ffb82vf,t1_ffb4bft,1579754560.0,"Try a thought experiment. Let's say it's 100% certain that the guy is sterile and has no STIs. Is it still wrong?

Of course it is. Even though there is no threat of those harms (unwanted pregnancy and STI contraction), the guy tricking the women into unknowingly engaging in bareback sex is being egregiously unethical because he is depriving her of informed choice, and this is likely to cause very real harm of a psychological nature.

In OP's case or a similar circumstance, you may not agree with the belief and value framework that underlies the emergence of that psychological harm (i.e. believing that the post-op trans person is a biological male, and he does not want to have sex with such people), but you need to respect their right to choice, to disagree to engage in sexual encounters in order to avoid that psychological harm (including harm that comes from being made fun of, if that's the basis of it)."

sex,ffayidd,t1_ffaw211,1579747439.0,"Yeah, bullshit. 

A straight guy being misled into having a sexual encounter with someone they may regard as a biological man (as many believe, whether you agree with that perspective or not) is not cool at all. 

People have a right to assert sexual boundaries. If they are tricked into not knowing what they've consented to, that isn't consent."
