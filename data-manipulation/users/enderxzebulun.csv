At a conservative 6.5% growth over 20 years they would have $211k available. You could also use the plan to pay for k-12 costs or even private schooling, if you're inclined. If you have multiple children your plan should allow you to split and rollover some of the money to plans for each child; you could also just change the beneficiary if they don't need the money concurrently.

If it is an assigned collection then contact the doctor's office via USPS ""certified mail with return receipt requested"" stating the debt was payed as agreed with photocopy proof. Request that they respond within 10 business days confirming that they and their assigned agent will stop all collection efforts and that any inaccurate credit information they may have supplied to reporting agencies will be deleted at their next reporting date.

If the debt was purchased by the collection agency you basically need to send something similar to the debt collector except adjusting the language appropriately as they have no assigned agent. You should also include a statement directing them to contact you regarding this debt only via mail to your current address.  Save all correspondence and keep a handwritten log of dates and what you sent and received along with the certified mail delivery receipts, even after you've fixed this.

personalfinance,fe8fycc,t3_eo42w2,1578925748.0,"Two points I have to offer:

- Regardless of what you decide to do based on other good advice here, never cash out and close your TSP. You can use it later in life to roll in other tax advantaged retirement savings if you need to do something like perform backdoor Roth IRA contributions. If you don't understand what this means that's ok but someday you'll appreciate having access to TSP. I regret closing mine when I was younger and unaware.  The TSP's G Fund is also a unique fixed income fund with characteristics you cannot really find anywhere else.

- Take the opportunity to build your credit now and do so responsibly. You should be able to get approved for an unsecured card unless you have recent defaults on your report. If you don't get approved online you can call the issuer's reconsideration line and there is a decent chance they will approve you because they know military is a relatively secure paycheck and your command is likely to crawl up your ass if they need to come after you.  Also note that (at least for AmEx) many cards will waive any annual fee via SCRA.

personalfinance,fdcv171,t3_ekkkkc,1578285110.0,"You asked primarily financial questions but here are some other hard learned tips:

- Go to your lectures and labs/discussion sections. You may be a good student with strong academic skills already in place but for me, when I was younger, it was all too easy to fall off the wagon especially in the first few semesters. ""They're 100 level gen eds, easy."" Maybe, go anyway and build a strong habit.

- Engage your professors and TAs if you need additional help. Even if you are doing fine, stop by a few times in the semester during office hours and ask some interesting questions about a topic to make your face known. Once you reach your major classes you may have the same professor several times over the course of your studies and them knowing you as an earnest student can help if you are ever border line on a grade or make them more amenable to working with you if other contingencies arise. *ABOVE ALL* they can serve as references and provide letters of recommendation, even years down the road when you are out of school, if you've left a memorable impression.

- Working a job whether on-campus or off is good to earn extra cash and reduce student loans you must take, but it also builds your work experience. If you can find something related to your major even better. For example let's say you're a Comp Sci major; you might work in one of the dorm cafeteria your freshman year, but many universities' Department of IT will hire for their resnet / student tech center help desk. By your last semester you could be performing some level of (probably limited) systems or network administration functions. IT operations experience is valuable even if you pursue software development. And if the dev side doesn't work out you now have a work experience in operations.  You should try applying this to whatever your degree/field will be, I simply chose IT/CS as it's what I'm familiar with.

- Have a social life, date and don't be held down too soon, take it all in because it's a unique time you will never quite experience the same feeling of youthful discovery again.

- College is not high school and you are an adult now. Your peers, professors and the faculty will treat you like one (and you should expect them to) and you should act like one and also realize you will encounter people with different thoughts and viewpoints. College has traditionally been a bastion of speech and a place where you are exposed to new ideas. You can disagree with others and shouldn't be afraid to do so vocally (indeed you should challenge others as they should challenge you so you both may grow), but do so in a polite manner that is respectful of this concept.

- Start your goddamn papers/projects early and do a little each day. Edit your goddamn work. Go back a few days later and re-read your work with fresh eyes and wonder what the fuck you were trying to say at 3 am. BACKUP YOUR GODDAMN WORK/COMPUTER.

- Contribute to group projects. Every group project will include peer evaluations, usually with feedback that you get to see and peer scoring only the professor/TA sees. That one slacker always thinks they're so clever having some excuse not showing up to a group meeting or uploading their group work. Like we forgot the last three times they had something come up at the darndest time.

- Take advantage of support structures if you find yourself struggling mentally or academically. The university should have plenty of resources and if you don't know how to find them just walk into the student center/registrar/any professor and ask, and don't feel awkward or ashamed. Remember again you're an adult and although you should expect to be treated with dignity and professionalism, it's much less likely anyone is going to be watching over you to make sure you're feeling OK like they may have at home or in high school.

- Stay away from Southern Comfort.
