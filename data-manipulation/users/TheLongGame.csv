California doesn’t have an estate/inheritance tax and we are in the bottom third of property tax. The changes to SALT deduction in the Trump tax cuts fucked us. There are no real special provisions for capital gains tax but that mostly affects the top 10%. Income and sales are for sure near the top of highest rates."

SquaredCircle,ffccqqv,t1_ffbop4p,1579796637.0,"Will a direct quote from Adam Pacitti change your mind?

Pacitti: We had no idea at all. He was so so important to WhatCulture Wrestling, incredibly incredibly popular, and his creativity was unreeling. He was such a talented guy and so when he did leave, we didn’t know at all. We had no idea because he was the face of the channel back then. So, I remember doing that video in Sam’s bedroom with me, Ross, Jack, and Sam, and being like “Hey, we don’t know”. We got so much tied up in this already, we were starting to look for offices and we had investors pullout because of Adam Blampied leaving

I get that Warband MP has a rep for being hard but is one of the most beautiful multiplayer games I have ever played. FInding RubbingMyAxe and killing him in a group fight doesn't happen often but feels great when you do. Once players get past a certain skill gap an entire new game opens up. There were be moments when you feel like a jedi blocking multiple swings and getting that bardiche kill with a single swing because you saw an opening."
mountandblade,ff78z7e,t3_erjowx,1579643482.0,Do you play single player or multiplayer? If you play singleplayer don't you will get ass kicked and burn out. If you play multiplayer don't the game a massive step down from the perfection that is Warband MP.
mountandblade,ff78dph,t1_ff76wdu,1579643137.0,"Hello fellow MP player!!!

We are truly the last of a dying breed.

I think there is going to be more emphasis on movement. The hit boxes are so tight and weapons don't have the shadow reach that Warband did. You have to move your dude in closer which makes reactions a bit harder. If you watch the video OP posted he rarely blocks attacks and is mostly stepping out range of swings.

\*slight tangent\*

I can appreciate seizure feinting but it really is viable in Duel servers. A troupe on this sub that bugs me is the fear of the naked 2h. Half the time they OK players that just learned how to chain blocks and really are not skilled.

mountandblade,ff7335j,t1_ff6suaz,1579640146.0,"A lot, Warband has an amazing skill depth that is not really present in Bannerlord. A lot will depend on if you play single player or multiplayer. If you only play single player it probably won’t matter. You will be wowed by the tight hitboxes and changes to shields. Multiplayer on the other hand is a step backwards in my opinion. In Warband MP there is a difference in left and right swings that matters. In SP you should only be swinging left if you are facing a NPC with 1h & shield just because it is a more likely to get around the shield. In MP it is matter of speed vs reach. Good players know this and there is a psychology to playing. In Bannerlord there is a unnamed system that we have been calling stances that change the players weight on the backfoot that affects how you swing. In groupfights this is unreadable. In 1v1 I don’t have enough experience to really say other then I don’t like the feel of it at the moment.  I could go on but I think I got the point across. I’m lucky and was in alpha and remember when the entire combat system was pure dogshit and had little to no redeeming factors. It has really improved over the months. 

TL:DR Warband is like Super Smash Melee and Bannerlord is like Super Smash Brawl."
