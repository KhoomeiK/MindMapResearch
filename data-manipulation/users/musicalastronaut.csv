If they have a kitchen, you can’t legally bring them in (like Sweetwater), but since the law changed only recently most existing breweries don’t have a kitchen added yet. Urban Tree changed to allow dogs inside maybe a year ago. The only one I can think of that I’ve been to that doesn’t allow dogs inside without the excuse of a kitchen is Three Taverns."
