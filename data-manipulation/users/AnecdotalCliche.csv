aww,fczdo87,t1_fcvjmbq,1578098862.0,"Well the hanafi rulings I read said its a case by case basis. Some apparently say pet dogs are fine but I didn't read into it since I'm not interested in dogs or ever exposed to them . 
For example this person asked about Guinea pigs :

Also something general info :

aww,fcv8ygw,t1_fcu9c00,1577997119.0,"I'm pretty curious about it,so I'll do some research.  
I've never had pets and live in a city so it's never been an issue. I only mentioned pigs because eof obvious reasons."
aww,fctxu64,t1_fct3jvz,1577964967.0,"Thanks for letting me know, I was actually curious but Google was only bringing up results about dogs."
aww,fcstkj1,t1_fcsrd09,1577924751.0,"Yep, most Muslims find it impure, but  malikis are a pretty big sect so I thought I'd mention it."
aww,fcstbu2,t1_fcsrhpk,1577924579.0,"I'm Muslim as well, I didn't mean to imply Muslims don't, I meant to imply that all Muslims should. Thanks for being a good person!   

However Islam is a philosophy so it should be teaching people to do/be better etc. I don't think it has *""nothing"" * to do with being a good person(and I'm not saying you can't be good without it before somebody decides to take offence). 

Yeah religion has always been used to justify injustice. Islam is just getting the shortend with most of the world being ignorant leading to fear etc."
aww,fcsndxy,t1_fcsan73,1577920329.0,"To be honest, most Muslims should be treating animals with kindness, if they understand the Quran or followed Muhammad's teaching.  

 For example dogs were allowed to roam in his mosque in Medhina during his time despite being ritually impure but a lot of Muslims fear them due to the latter. 

Edit - here's a wiki link with lots of information : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals_in_Islam"
aww,fcsn47w,t1_fcskd3z,1577920136.0,"I mean only dog saliva is specifically impure afaik, some madhab(I only know that malikis consider this) even only consider feral dog saliva ritually impure.  
I haven't heard of any other animals saliva being impure (other than pigs)."

dontputyourdickinthat,fcq9naw,t1_fcq4o3c,1577881654.0,"It was a limited release by Bandai in Japan.  
There's cheap fakes on ebay or any other Chinese website."
pics,fcou23m,t1_fcoq93c,1577841563.0,"It's not a derogatory term, but can be used as such. It just means lighter coloured and is used to describe white people. Black people have the opposite where they're described as darker. Everybody (including goreh /gori since it isn't used all the time) who doesn't fit into this gets called by their countries."
