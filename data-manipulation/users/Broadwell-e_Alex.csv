wholesomememes,fedvycd,t1_fedvf18,1579021037.0,"Doomer was once full of hope, He got forgotten about by everyone in his surroundings  and got rejected by girl after girl. Who would want to date a recluse? That put him where he is now. That made him a doomer. It is somewhat his fault as well, for letting himself fall into the pit of despair. He didn’t pick himself back up. He didn’t want to. He’s not content with where he is, but doesn’t care enough to change. Even though everyone around him tells him to change for the better. He subtly likes the lack of attention and loneliness."

You’re interacting with me, you don’t seem suicidal, you seem nice, I’m sure you could do whatever you want, hit the gym, find someone you like, ask them out. If that’s not what you’re looking for, then find what makes you happy. Do it regardless of what anyone else says."

Usually in his 20s, the doomer is typically unemployed or doing a dead-end job, tormented by unrequited love, and alienated from most of the population; and this sense of personal aimlessness and despair seeps into his views on the world in general. So he lives in constant despair for humanity's future, with the prospect of ecological catastrophes and economic downturns tormenting his mind. To dull his sense of Weltschmerz he smokes, or drinks, takes drugs. But nothing can quite take away the dread that the doomer constantly feels towards the future. Hence his name.

He is the inheritor of a long tradition of being jaded with the world, and adopting this as a consistent worldview: he looks and nods at those that deny life: Hegesias of Cyrene, the Buddhists, Schopenhauer. But as a product of the modern world, he couldn't pretend that there is any ultimate spiritual redemption at the end. So he can only deny, deny, deny.
After she left him forever, he sat down, despondent and empty. But he mustered up the energy to put on his 90s playlist; and when the guitars from My Bloody Valentine's Loveless screeched their first note, he knew he was now a doomer.”"
