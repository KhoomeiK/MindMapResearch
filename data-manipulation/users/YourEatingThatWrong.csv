sewing,ffp4xz0,t3_eu6r6p,1580086307.0,"Last year. No we didn’t have a home Ec class which is sad. I would have learned I loved this a whole lot sooner lol. My aunt taught me how to use her sewing machine and my grandmother taught me to read a pattern. The rest is just triple and error.

To the benefited question. Sewing has given me confidence. I do a lot of art but sewing is one that I really feel like I’m creating something impressive. The genuine reactions I get from people build me up so much. I also get unbelievably excited about new projects and I actually want to finish them. It’s also opened my eyes to how the fast fashion industry is killing fashion."

plantclinic,ffdgegv,t1_ffddxuz,1579820319.0,"So I read somewhere when plants don’t get the right amount of water/sun they can become susceptible to pest. Succulents usually have great defenses towards pest but when their environment isn’t suitable they get weak. My theory is it got a pest infection and now is stressed out so the black and yellow. I’m sorry I’m not much help :/ 

I do know they won’t bloom if they are in to much sun."

plantclinic,ffddbvm,t1_ffdbgys,1579818486.0,Okay so the plant probably got really stressed with the pest and then the pesticide. I had one that got melee bugs and the spider mites. Is the amount of light it’s getting the same as the last place?

AskMen,ffcqkkr,t3_esruuu,1579805163.0,I’m a woman but my husband and I almost never wear our real rings. We have silicone rings we wear because we both work with our hands for work. If he or I don’t wear it it’s not a problem but I know both of us genuinely love wearing something. It’s a reminder of each other and I know for me it’s a little bit of pride that I snagged a really good one.

Throw the whole man out?

I literally forgot to do laundry last week and my husband offered to let me borrow his boxers or his skivvies so I didn’t have to go commando. You do you. If sleeping in boxers is comfortable for you then that’s what you should do. Clothes shouldn’t be your BFs defining line in finding you attractive."
AnimalsBeingBros,ff6jsz1,t1_ff669e6,1579628715.0,"So lions are somewhat chill. When prides are fed they generally leave people alone. These are three males so they are most likely brothers that will eventually form their own prides. 

Lions are lazy lol."
AnimalsBeingBros,ff60g0i,t1_ff5jlwj,1579615928.0,That’s why whenever I hear someone hunted a Lion it only doubles my judgement. You basically drove out and found a lion laying in the grass and shot. It’s not like a deer.

FullTiming,ff413og,t1_ff3xbl9,1579553252.0,What did you build the bench out of? I was thinking of that being an option. I was going to see if maybe I could build a custom carrier for the cat. So that the dog and her are separated.

FullTiming,ff3ls6l,t1_ff3lmhw,1579543766.0,Okay that’s fair :/ lol well I guess we will just take everything slow and try different things. The vet should be able to give advice right?
FullTiming,ff3kd0m,t1_ff3k3gd,1579542898.0,Thank you we could do one of those metal kennels. That’s actually a really good idea.
FullTiming,ff3jtzv,t1_ff3fevi,1579542576.0,Awesome thank you. I’m thinking we might just have to do several trike runs on short drives to see how the cat and dog function best together. I’m nervous about the idea of her being loose in the truck cab. I’d feel horrible if we got into a reck and she got hurt.
FullTiming,ff3jota,t1_ff3gnq8,1579542490.0,How long do y’all go without a break? Our cat is 15 and when my husband and I talked about it we thought maybe doing 4 hour driving increments would be best. That way she could have 3 hours inside the 5th wheel to relax a little bit. We also have a 90lb dog and I haven’t had them ride together in the car with the cat lose before.

FullTiming,ff39agg,t1_ff391e1,1579536711.0,Lol that’s hilarious! That might actually be an option. Thank you.
FullTiming,ff37d68,t1_ey6xupi,1579535437.0,This. It seriously depends on what RV meets your needs. We started out looking at Class A/C and then ended up picking out a pull behind. It just met all of our needs and it meant we didn’t have to pull one of our non tow compatible cars behind it.
RVLiving,ff364e9,t1_ff35y1i,1579534587.0,"Because it’s 30,000 and it’s actually something we can easily afford. It’s a 2020 and we personally liked that GD’s model. We haven’t been able to find a used one in our area. It’s also a all season RV which we just haven’t been able to find anything like it. It meets all of our needs in one unit. Desk area, full size shower, 50amp, duke A/C and in good condition. We’ve done a lot of looking and a lot of shopping around. 

But what are we losing here because buying used and new both have their pros and cons."

RVLiving,fencynb,t1_fen8sw9,1579282029.0,"Okay slight hiccup with that option. The RV itself isn’t running and is sitting at the machine shop we had its transmission looked at. Would an RV inspector still be able to inspect it even though we don’t have access to hook ups? 

If it’s any help the water leak happened while I was living in it and I shut off the water when I found it."

ZeroWaste,fel5mf0,t1_fel4zya,1579214566.0,So I live in a pretty modern city and we had to boil our water because it over flowed... it happens in the US. With climate change it’s going to happen more often. The point is we need to move to greener solutions and composting toilets although are in their infancy are a promising option. Even if we don’t use it on crops it’s not like we can’t use that compost to go on fertilizing green spaces.
