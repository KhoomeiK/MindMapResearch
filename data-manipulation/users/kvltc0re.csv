From SKM early era I love Pancho Villa, the acoustic and string section led version of Salvador Sanchez. Never Ending Math Equation from tiny cities and the early version of Admiral Fell Promises. Tonight the Sky from April is beautiful and heartbreaking.

Australian Winter from AFP is stunning. Uk Blues I is my favourite from Among the Leaves, it has such strong imagery and such melancholy melody, I feel like I’m with him on that crappy European Tour when I hear it.

From his collaborations I love What Happened to My brother from Jimmy Lavelle, I’m estranged from my brother like him and it really hits me hard in a lot of ways. From Desertshore “Hey you bastards...” is amazing musically and lyrically, Livingstone Bramble also great, and Brothers is heartbreaking. From Jesu Exodus is stunning, and from 30 Seconds I love Needles Disney, it’s an interesting story and haunting. From Koz, Boye and White Astronomy is super pretty and completely heartwarming.

I’ll skip Benji cause it’s been covered, but from Universal Themes Birds of Flims is completely stunning, and similarly to UK Blues he captures it so well that I feel like I’m right there with him in the Alps on this bizarre journey that movie shoot took him on.

From As Common as Light I find I can’t get away from Chilli Lemon Peanuts, it has so much excitement and adrenaline to it, and then closes out with that haunting electric piano line and spoken word section, it felt really new and instantly got my attention.

From This Is My Dinner Soap For Joyful hands was absolutely amazing, he literally gave me goosebumps from talking about soap, like he says, who else could give you that?

From New Orleans I found Day In America and I’m not Laughing at you to be perfection, Donny’s saxophone elevated the band to a whole new level.

And finally from the new Koz with Petra Haden album I am completely in love with 1983 MTV Era...

Completely miserable and losing my mind. People talk about it’s effect on people with heart and lung issues, but mental health is also going to be a huge issue in the community, I already have severe mental health issues, and it’s pushing me to the limit this week."
canberra,fd6lbqq,t1_fd68fx0,1578192694.0,"I had a similar situation a few months ago, getting absolutely microscopic notice for cancellation of a casual shift, I checked all legislation I could finding thinking it had to surely be unlawful, but it is actually allowed, the legislation gives employers a lot of wiggle room, so casual shifts can essentially be canceled at any time, it’s really shitty."
canberra,fd5jcti,t3_ek1pab,1578178233.0,Any ideas how long it’ll last this time? The ACT government site just says “Next few days” but that’s a very general statement.

Scott Morrison is like the generic brand version two shelves below, different packaging, slightly cheaper, but what lies within is the exact same piece of shit."
canberra,fcu7p1z,t3_eis9fk,1577974517.0,"I’ve been really struggling today, I had to go out to collect some things in the morning and it was unbreathable and painful.

I’ve been cooped at home for days, I’m so sick of not being able to breath properly, we have no money for things like air purifiers, we don’t even have A/C.

Not only is this bad for lung and heart conditions, my mental health is being absolutely tanked right now, I just want this to be over, I want daylight back, I want oxygen back.

My brain hasn’t been working well today either, I can’t hold conversations, keep having to get my wife to repeat everything 3 times because I can’t process it. I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this, and I know the worst may be yet to come."
canberra,fctn2z4,t1_fctmz1u,1577949681.0,Good one.
