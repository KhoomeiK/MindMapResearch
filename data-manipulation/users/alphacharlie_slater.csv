Before we could have something tangible, limited in quantity, and sought after for its many beneficial properties. And it uses up shit loads of power mining for it.

All my assets can’t be gold, because most people would accept it. Most people who “own” gold have it stored somewhere with everyone else’s gold. Other precious metals have value too. It’s that a dollar bill is now not tied to anything, and is worthless. I guess thinking about it, the gold standard really didn’t make paper money any more valuable."

She says no and is very persistent in stonewalling my ambitions. She keeps pestering and telling me all the reasons we shouldn’t go. I actually bring up some good points, and I really want to go so I push harder. I hit some button after arguing, and finally she gives up and says “fine, we can go”. At this point I don’t want to concede anymore to my wife, and deep down I want to make her happy, so we end up not going to ikea.

Now, what is the point in which most of the anti vaccine population throws their arms up and says “fine, I’ll go ahead and vaccinate”? Has the problem festered so far down the rabbit hole there is no way to salvage our relationships? Will we reach a point when the vaccine population just doesn’t care anymore and the problem is left to incubate further? I honestly don’t know. But in any case it is a giant problem."

If anything, we should have been more empathetic to these people who are willingly ignorant for the sake of their child’s mental well being, weighing it far more heavily than their kid’s long term physical well being. However, as a parent I just can’t make this calculation being educated and aware of the potential ramifications of the choice to forgo vaccinating.

I am totally at a loss for these people, who are putting not only their kids but the other kids too young to receive vaccines.

I like to think these people just choose to be ignorant; because if they are knowingly doing this, it would be much much worse for me to comprehend. It also doesn’t bode well to our future and the rise of super bugs and viruses much worse than anything we know of today, which will likely become resistant to vaccinations and modern antibodies.

This is absolutely a terrifying realty we are living. The next global pandemic will probably happen during my lifetime. And what’s worse, it will probably be caused by a complete published fabrication linking autism and vaccines which was later disproved. If anything, it should be a lesson to the scientific community that the majority of people can’t comprehend the full picture of these problems when the health of their family could be compromised.

There is one person impatient or not paying attention and runs into the crowd pushing a few people out of the way until they get near the front and trip.

Remember all the times you got into stop and go traffic waiting to see an accident or someone pulled over just to discover nothing.

I will concede that the faster you go, the more severe the accident will be. The equation for energy is a function of velocity squared. However, if there are fewer opportunities for an accident, it really doesn’t matter.

Parenting,fdawc9b,t3_ekej3i,1578251107.0,"I think as long as you are consistent your kid will learn that the series of events before bed means sleep. We would always do a book, lights off, list what we are thankful for, and some snuggles before tucking into bed, and always in bed by a specific time. It was difficult for the first year but he finally goes to sleep when his head touches the pillow or will kind of just doze and stare at things around the room. I really think the consistency of mr Rogers it what made him so good for kids, and the same is true for traditions you keep up.

Best of luck!"

And the kid reference was to those who think it would be a good idea to bring one of these inside their home.

I understand there are people who maybe specialize in maintaining animal populations and sometimes will keep them inside to rehabilitate, but I honestly doubt this is the case here.

It’s almost on par with people keeping snow leopards as pets or training them to do magic tricks.

Just let animals do what they do in the wild. Help me understand if there are other legitimate reasons for a normal civilization to take it upon themselves to bring in wild animals and keep them as pets."
