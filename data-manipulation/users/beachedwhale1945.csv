WarshipPorn,ffjthzj,t1_ffhj2di,1580006514.0,"In his book on the Jutland wrecks Innes McCartney publishes all seven known photos of *Invincible*, four showing the blast and three her remains. Four of these were by Midshipman J. Croome on *Indomitable* and are part of a sequence, and one of the bow and stern is famous, but the other two are this photo and one very similar, but with slight differences. McCartney cites this article, but provides no details on the reasons why it could be a fake. 

He has three hypotheses:

1. Based on D. K. Brown's analysis, these could be two frames of a motion picture that has subsequently been lost or remains buried in the archives. 

2. This famous photo could be a photogravure, ""a process used to create high-quality plates"", and *The Fighting at Jutland* (1921) does have some composite images noted in the captions and mislabels images. In this guise the similar image could be a failed photogravure and this one the second attempt. 

3. The second image, which is overall poorer quality, could be a poorly developed version of the legitimate image, or both of these are from the same negative. 

He concludes his discussion on these two with this line:

>The truth may never be known now, but there is just enough doubt cast over these images to make me cautious in accepting what they show as incontrovertible. 

With the caveat that I don't have that article on reasons why it could be a fake, I would propose another alternative: there was an original image that has been modified. The destroyers in the back could be legitimate (the Harper map in McCartney's book shows some tracks about in the right spot at the right time, but their labels are outside the area shown), or they could be composited in later. The missing shell splashes are not conclusive: no ship exploded the instant the shells hit, and there are a few accounts suggesting some time passed:

>[W]e observed 2 dull glows amidships. The appearance aws that the armour was withstanding the impact of the shells. But a few moments later a great mushroom of smoke rose to the clouds. 

>There was an appreciable interval after the enemy shell had hit her before the resulting explosion was noticeable. 

The two pieces of evidence that most suggest a fast explosion are an account by surviving gunnery officer Hubert Dannreuther, who describes the explosion ""Almost immediately follow[ed]"" the hit and the *Derfflinger's* note that (quoting Campbell's *Jutland: An Analysis of the Fighting) ""as the fall of shot indicator sounded for the 3rd [salvo], the red flame of a hit was unmistakably seen, and in a few seconds the *Invincible* blew up"", though the Germans credited the ship to *Lutzow* that was also firing at the time. Thus the missing shell splashes are not conclusive either way. 

However, these do not prove the images are legitimate, only that there is plenty of grey. Enough that I concur with McCartney: I cannot treat them as gospel, though they do show a realistic series of events that does not quite align with eyewitness accounts. 

There is very strong physical evidence that, once the explosion started (however long after the hit), the ship sank quickly. P and Q turrets were ejected from the ships, their barbettes acting like gun barrels, and now lie 120m west of the ship, suggesting she sank in ""no less than 12 seconds"". Dannreuther suggests she sank in 10-15 seconds."

Extremely difficult. The Tallboy required a modified Lancaster four engined heavy bomber, a far cry from the single engine carrier bombers used throughout the war. The B5N Kates attacking the battleships had 800 kg bombs, near the limits of their payload capacity, and had no hope of carrying a bomb over 5,000 kg. The planes that could were incapable of taking off from carriers, never mind landing: even the B-25s of the Doolittle Raid only had a 900 kg payload. 

Come to think, I don’t know if half a dozen carrier-based aircraft ever deployed could carry a single bomb that large. Some of the postwar nuclear-capable bombers could if they were shaped properly, but from memory only the A-2, A-3, and A-5 could carry weapons so large. And of course C-130s with Daisy Cutters, but only a single C-130 ever actually operated from a single carrier as part of a series of tests."

Normal practice torpedoes (really normal torpedoes with a different head) were not set to impact the a target ship. This would damage both ship and torpedo, and so they were set to run under the target ship. This actually delayed discovery of a flaw: they’d run deeper than set, and had the torpedoes been set to hit the target the problem would have been exposed well before WWII. At the end of the run the practice torpedo would blow the water from the exercise head, making the torpedo float to the surface for recovery, refurbishment, and reuse. Most torpedo exercises used these heads, by late in WWII “All torpedoes must be given a proving run before being sent into service” in addition to training, and these were common in other navies, I have US test reports of Japanese torpedoes after WWII that show some torpedoes were tested four times. 

However, US torpedoes early in WWII were notoriously unreliable and had many flaws, most famously with the magnetic detonators. Another flaw was with the contact detonators, and to demonstrate the new detonators functioned properly the US developed a modified “war exercise head” that would release a set of plywood disks to mark the spot where the detonator fired. These torpedoes still had the blowing mechanism rather than warhead and could be recovered as normal, but they were more likely to be lost if the head was damaged."

WarshipPorn,ffdzxv4,t1_ffdawux,1579833133.0,"I had thought by “short term” you might have meant “current day”. 

I have two problems with this argument and it’s cousins others make:

1. At the time when *Prinz Eugen* could potentially have become a museum (we’ll ignore everyone pushing for using her as a target), Nazism was on the run, literally. True Nazis were laying low, the lukewarm ones were abandoning the cause, so the possibility of the ship becoming a shrine was practically nonexistent. Had the ship become a museum at that time she would have started as a war trophy, a very much anti-Nazi affair. 

2. Assuming the ship had survived to the present day, she could have plenty of safeguards to prevent her from becoming a shrine (by showing Nazi horrors and poor German engineering that would put them in their place). But even if she somehow became a shrine I would oppose destroying a piece of history because some idiots have failed to learn it. 

> I see these surface ships as a greater source of Nazi fetishism online than I do their u-boat arms, this is only my experience.

I usually see that focused on *Bismarck*, but *Prinz Eugen* would be an excellent counter. The director of the Deutsches Panzermuseum Munster takes great pride in showing the true flaws of the vaunted German tanks and, as he puts it, “breaking” those who glorify the “superior” German military of WWII. Between her faulty propulsion plant, inefficient armor layout, pathetic AA defense, and horrid radar it’s safe to say *Prinz Eugen* could easily do the same. 

> I used 'short term' to try and separate this suspicion from the idea that such a site would also unintentionally promote future neo-nazis (long term), which I don't believe would be the case.

Then we agree here, and while I will leave my second point (as this is relevant to arguments outside this narrow discussion of specific warships), for the record I recognize you are not making the argument to destroy the ship had she become a museum. Others, however, do make those arguments.

*U-505* is not a Neo-Nazi shrine. *U-534* is not a shrine.

Based on these, we must acknowledge the chances of a ship as important as *Prinz Eugen*, where concerns about making her a shrine would be even more pronounced and thus safeguards even more stringent, are remote.  

The problem is you are alleging that *maybe* the ship could be a shrine, thus the ship should never have been saved as a museum. That stinks of the same logic behind the Japanese internment (some may be a threat, so let's lock them all up) and to a certain extent of some Nazi anti-Jewish policies (some of which acknowledged the occasional ""good Jew"").

[Her Gunnery Aspects Report](http://www.hmshood.org.uk/reference/official/adm234/234509encIVa.gif) notes she did not straddle *Bismarck* until her sixth salvo. While not explicitly stated the report makes it clear she was firing half salvos, half her shells a few seconds apart often at slightly different ranges, which is why some salvos are paired on her track chart and in her description and the track chart shows she fired three salvos a minute (the strongest evidence is shells fired and known breakdowns, which only align if each salvo was half her guns, but I'll set that aside as it's off topic). 

*Bismarck* initially fired a full broadside before shifting to half-salvos, unlike the British with each salvo counted as 8 guns. Her second full salvo, a 400 bracket, scored a straddle with the base and an over with the long. From this point she began rapid fire. 

Thus *Bismarck* began to straddle from the third time she fired her guns, *Prince of Wales* on her sixth. Or put another way, *Bismarck* straddled from the second setup and *Prince of Wales* the third. How much of this is fire control and how much the British were silhouetted by the rising sun (not quite but close) is not clear, as those conditions would favor the Germans.

It was impossible for the German shell to properly penetrate the deck armor. Quoting [Jurens](http://www.navweaps.com/index_inro/INRO_Hood.php#Vulnerability_of_the_Armor_System):

>Depending upon the exact location of the hit, a shot perforating the 127mm belt would still have to penetrate approximately 160-180mm of deck armor in order to reach the magazines. If the hit went through the 178mm belt instead, only about 130mm of deck penetration would have been required, but in compensation the shell would have been traveling much more slowly. In either case the trajectory of the projectile, its velocity, and its high obliquity would have rendered useful penetration to the area of the magazines highly unlikely.^(56) Even assuming the projectile were not rejected or deflected by *Hood*'s deck armor, the fuze delay of the German projectiles would have probably detonated the shell before it could reach a magazine. Assuming that the required deck penetrations reduced the projectile's average velocity to half of the plate exit velocity, a nominal fuze delay of 0.035 seconds corresponds to a travel of only eight meters at best, not enough to reliably reach a magazine.^(57) The German penetration diagrams are reproduced below. ...

>The angle of fall of the incoming shells was only from 10.6° to 13.9°, which is a very high obliquity for deck penetration indeed. Graphs of German armor penetration for the 380mm shell (see previous page) stop at an obliquity of 20° and must be extrapolated to obtain any figure at all for an obliquity greater than this. Further, the best estimates obtained by such extrapolation seem to yield a total penetration capability of only about 65mm. The total thickness of deck armor protecting the magazines in this area, admittedly distributed amongst several layers, amount to approximately 120mm. On average, penetration via this route, especially by a damaged projectile, is therefore considered unlikely.

This hypothesis can be eliminated.

Eight new frigates/light frigates/large corvettes in four years would be a good job of bringing new ships into service in the modern era. only the Chinese and US beat this number for similar ships in a similar period, though others building larger ships (France and Italy come to mind, I'd have to check India more closely, Japan falls short) had similar tonnage commissioned per year.

I ignored future ships except for the intentionally vague line ""More of all of these or their successor designs are planned"", which given the uncertainty between talk and action is as far as I am willing to go.

They are still a large surface combatant, and even if tasked to the same basic as frigates are far more capable and will be deployed to different areas. For example, the American *Spruance* class destroyer and *Perry* class frigates were both anti-submarine focused, but the former was far more capable than the latter and intended for higher threat environments. The same difference holds between the *Ticonderoga* and Type 45 classes, both anti-air specialists but with vastly different capabilities. 

>Although they aren't frigates yet, after the MLU of the five Udaloys, they are now downgraded to FFG.

The *Udaloy*s have always officially been Large ASW Ships, a unique Russian classification to distinguish their anti-submarine and more general purpose destroyers. In the west this would be the difference between a destroyer (DD) and guided missile destroyer (DDG). Japan is a good example of a nation that has maintained this distinction even though their modern destroyers have surface to air missile capability, like the *Udaloy*s. 

As a consequence, I am not sure if by saying ""they are now downgraded to FFG"" you are discussing the term for Large ASW Ship, an anti-submarine destroyer, or if they are being classified as frigates. The information I have suggests after the modification they well be reclassified as destroyers, not frigates, furthering the confusion. 

This is a textbook example of I make a point about official classifications causing confusion. Two ships can have the same official classification yet be very different, and two very similar ships can have different classifications. This is one such case of a problem evident in many navies, not just the Russians, that causes unnecessary confusion for the uninitiated, heightens problems already inherent when two people speak different languages, and poor comparisons that either over or undervalue the capabilities of different nations. While I cannot speak to the first point as I don't know your knowledge level, the second and third are very clear: classifying the *Udaloy* class with the VLS upgrade as frigates rather than destroyers undervalues their capabilities compared to ships of a similar size, capability, and age, and in turn undervalues the capabilities of the Russian Navy."

This is little better than their five and two totals in 2010. 

In 2016 they added two *Grigorovich* light frigates. In 2017 they added another *Grigorovich* and a *Steregushchiy*. In 2018 they added the first *Gorshkov*, another *Steregushchiy*, and the first *Bykov* offshore patrol vessel. In 2019, they added another *Bykov*.

As of today (according to Russian Ships Info and cross referenced with other sources), five *Gorshkov* class frigates, four *Steregushchiy* and two *Gremyashchiy* class large corvettes, and four *Bykov* OPVs are under construction or on trials. Sources disagree on whether the three remaining *Grigorovich* class frigates, whose construction has been halted due to using Ukrainian engines, will be completed for Russia with domestic engines or India with the originals, some suggest two for India and one for Russia.

While all active, given Russia that does not mean they were operational, though the last four were rather new ships (all under a decade old except *Neustrashimy* herself, completed in 1990 or 1993 depending on source) so were likely operational.

As an aside, I’d never really looked into Soviet era frigates, mainly larger ships and submarines, and am rather surprised how few there were. The Krivaks (21 1135 Krivak Is, 11 1135M Krivak IIs, and three 11352/11353 Krivak IVs modified from Is, 32 total outside border guard) were their only significant domestic design that qualifies (save a Koni demonstrator/trainer for the export pattern, some 50s ships, and a couple other oddballs). Most of their ships were corvette sized, a focus I’d expected but didn’t realize just how extreme it would be. I knew western navies had more of a frigate focus, but didn’t expect the disparity was this significant.

history,ff8qgks,t3_es4rdr,1579691802.0,"I’ll mention one common claim that is debated in hopes I can get an answer. 

During WWII the Germans and Japanese sent several submarines between the two nations for technology exchange. Most never made it, including one of the last, *U-234*, a Type XB minelayer converted into a transport submarine. It’s final cargo included about 560kg of uranium oxide, but as Germany surrendered it sailed for the US under a black flag per Allied orders, though the two Japanese officers aboard committed suicide.

Up to this point all sources agree. Where they disagree is how enriched the uranium was and what the purpose was. Some say it was for the Japanese nuclear program, going so far as to claim all they needed for a bomb was this uranium. Others state it was not enriched at all and was intended as a catalyst for synthetic fuel the Japanese desperately needed, but while I’ve found some circumstantial evidence it can be used I’ve never found anything with details on how that process would work. Many sources also claim the submarine carried complete but disassembled Me 262 aircraft, but in reality they carried documentation.

E: clarification

It is an oversimplification that ignores key nuance, as are all such ""two groups"" comparisons, but these are the two most vocal camps. 

>If or one like the idea of those ships but they are just way to expensive. I get that the few zumwalts are so expensive because they are pretty experimental. But the lcs freedom class and the f125 should be a lot cheaper for what they offer.

I would personally count this as a legitimate problem, or rather given the complexities behind the costs of modern technology, probably legitimate. *Zumwalt* is a good example: when the order was slashed from seven to two and later upped to three, the cost per ship rose as the development costs now spread over fewer ships. 

For the LCS there is one important aspect to consider when it comes to cost: the different shipyards. *Burkes* (the general comparison) are built at two well established shipyards, Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi and Bath Iron Works in Maine, with long histories of warship contracts and building *Burkes*, as the [Shipbuilding History](http://shipbuildinghistory.com/shipyards/large/ingalls.htm) pages [show](http://shipbuildinghistory.com/shipyards/large/bath.htm). Not so for the LCS: [Austal USA](http://shipbuildinghistory.com/shipyards/large/austal.htm) is a very new shipyard in Alabama with ten ships and boats of all sizes, eight under 1,000 tons, before the LCS came along, and while [Marinette Marine](http://shipbuildinghistory.com/shipyards/large/marinette.htm) has a long history of small craft, their most significant government contracts have been tugs, YPs, and buoy tenders. Both saw major expansion for these contracts, and much of the costs for the LCS program has gone to the expansions the program required. Had the exact same ships been built at Bath or Ingalls, they would have been cheaper, especially the early ships. 

I am less knowledgeable about the F125 issues other than the fact that this was the first major surface ship contract for the yards for a long time, thus they likely had to rebuild their infrastructure and talent pool to some degree (experienced workers would have gone to other employers and would need major incentives to come back).

So it was dropped, the programme cost was reduced a bit (we're talking about the largest financial crisis since 1929 here), it could be sold to the public far easier and everyone was content.

In addition, the armament was not necessary for its primary role as essentially a large OPV with limited combat capability. The most significant armament on the ship is a 5” gun, added for shore bombardment. This can be overseas against minor threats, like in support of special forces against militia groups, or it could be part of a more significant naval operation, where it would undoubtedly be in conjunction with other European navies. The increased protection standards compared to OPVs are in part to maintain that capability for future ships were its necessary, but also because in the overseas deployments with a small crew the ship may take damage: with a small crew it’s important to isolate the damage as rapidly as possible so the ship can safely return to the shipyard rather far away. 

With all this context, the design of the ship makes sense **for the German needs**. It doesn’t make sense for other nations to build similar ships, but they have their own set of needs and design ships for those needs. The F125 program was not optimal, there were serious problems with the ships as completed, but for that is a separate discussion from if the ship itself makes sense.

>By the late 1980s the Soviet economy had stagnated. This left the recently promoted Soviet leader, Gorbachev, with a serious dilemma. Unless he could somehow resuscitate the economy, he was liable to run out of money. As we have seen, this situation can get leaders into serious trouble. In order to get the economy moving so that there would continue to be enough money, Gorbachev needed to loosen control over the people, freeing their suppressed entrepreneurial potential.

>Economic liberalization wasn’t a simple matter for the Soviets. It entailed giving Soviet citizens many more personal and political freedoms. On the upside this allowed the people to communicate, coordinate, and interact, which can be good for economic growth. On the downside, allowing people to communicate, coordinate, and interact facilitates mass political protest. Gorbachev was no fool and presumably he knew liberalization could get him into trouble. Unfortunately for him, he was between a rock and a hard place. Without a stronger economy his Soviet Union could not hope to compete with the United States and maintain its superpower status. And more importantly he could not pay party members the rewards they were used to. To get a stronger economy he had to put his political control at risk, both from the masses who wanted a speedier path to prosperity and from within his coalition by those who feared losing their privileges. Gorbachev rolled the dice and ultimately lost.

>First Gorbachev faced a coup from within his own coalition. In 1991, harder line antireform party members, fearful of losing their special privileges (a loss openly advocated by Boris Yeltsin), deposed Gorbachev and took control of the government. But then Boris Yeltsin, standing atop a tank in Red Square, ensured that the Soviet military would not fire on protesters who wanted reform. The mass movement, with Boris Yeltsin at its head, overthrew the coup that wanted to return the Soviet Union’s more repressive policies of the past. The mass movement returned Gorbachev ever so briefly to power, leaving him with a much diminished rump Soviet Union, and paving the way for the dissolution of the Soviet empire just a few months later.

In this context, Gorbachev’s policies are not for the public good, but his own. They briefly aligned, which unquestionably happens in many cases, but it was not made purely for the public good. That is evident in other analyses of the end of the Soviet Union. 

I am not familiar enough with the other events to comment in any detail, the histories of Spain and Taiwan are not areas I have studied, but it appears at a cursory glance there were similar situations with rocky coalitions looking to increase their support and secure their rocky position.

I certainly suspect it’s over 600 feet wide. 

That said, the rest of the “blocking the channel” idea is flawed for all the reasons you’ve stated and more. [Setting aside the fact she was bombed southeast of Ford Island in an area that couldn’t possibly block the channel](http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/BB36/PearlHarborDamageReport/PlateI.jpg), which I find the single most conclusive piece of evidence in this debate, even if she sank in the narrowest part of the channel ships could easily pass by. If she was heading down the channel then she’d only block a narrow portion, and with a safety area 100 feet on either beam (~300 feet in total) ships could still pass, though likely at lower speeds than normal for safety. The channel would occasionally be blocked for a few hours at a time as salvage teams worked on the ship and barges and cranes moved around her, though they’d likely schedule the warship passages like roadwork on the interstate to cause minimal disruption. Even assuming she completely blocked the dredged portion of the channel, perfectly perpendicular in the narrowest chokepoint, we’d move heaven and earth to clear a new channel around one end, probably ready in under two weeks at worst. As most Battle and Scouting Fleet cruisers and all carriers were outside the harbor and most submarines forward deployed to the Asiatic Fleet, the most significant ships trapped would be destroyers, which could likely clear the channel after a day or two due to their size, and battleships, which didn’t do much anyway and took time to clear the harbor even if minimally damaged. I see no reason why this would be a serious problem for months, though it would be inconvenient. 

I imagine a few Japanese pilots in the spur of the moment thought they’d block the channel, so the line makes some sense as pilots are not known for downplaying their success, but it casts a completely wrong impression of the situation the way it’s edited.

WarshipPorn,ff48t9a,t1_ff3wj8f,1579558043.0,"While not directly related, this passage from Friedman on Cold War US missile escorts explains this need:

>A missile ship required far more than the missile launcher proper. Time delays inherent in missile operation required aircraft detection far beyond missile range. For example, in April 1956 it was estimated that Terrier, which then had a range of about 10 miles, required target detection at 150 to 250 nm. and tracking by the equivalent of an air intercept radar at 100 nm., against a Mach 2 target that could cover about 20 nm. per minute, of 100 nm. in five minutes. 

This basic concept still applies today. The margin will have shrunk as warship technology improved, but will have grown as missiles and aircraft become faster and more difficult to detect and track. How these counteract depends on the system, but you need superior range for good missile ships, and any ship with a better range will have an advantage in getting rounds off first, increasing the probability of a kill."

WarshipPorn,ff3hd1z,t1_ff34bhv,1579541057.0,"First, [UK capital ship production](https://i.imgur.com/yWROWf7.png). Each block covers the time from keel laying to launch and represents one building slip devoted to the ships. This is central to the discussion at several points. The ships are color coded, though as I also use this for other warship types (in hidden rows of the shipyards) they are more similar. However, the difference between 13.5” and 12” ships is clear for battlecruisers, though less so for battleships. 

>HMS Indefatigable and her sister ships were the successor class to the Invincible class, a slightly modified and lengthed design, and not a dedicated colonial battlecruiser

For *Indefatigable*, this is partially valid (see below), but the rest of your statement is essentially the same claim I made, just phrased differently. We agree thus far, though we’ll come back to successor design in a moment. 

>British practice was to build a battlecruiser or a pair of battlecruisers per class of battleship; The Invincibles for Dreadnought and the Bellerophon class, the Indefatigables for the Colossus and St. Vincent classes, the Lion class for the Orion class, and HMS Tiger for the King George V class. 

Even a casual glance at the production chart above shows this is false. *New Zealand* and *Australia* were laid down after all four *Orions*, and considering the significant gap between the *Invincibles* and *Indefatigable* tying any of the three to the *St. Vincent* class is weak. 

Note also it appears *Indefatigable* and *Lion* appear to have used the same building slip. The significant capability jump between these two suggests she was designed to round out a four-ship squadron of *Invincible*-style ships, implicitly second tier ships due to the advanced *Lion* design at this stage. 

>As for the armour, or lack there of on most British battlecruisers, save HMS Hood and the refitted Renowns and to a lesser degree HMS Tiger, was because they were supposed to fill a different role than they ended up fulfilling. This only became apparent after war was declared in 1914, which was the reason the Renowns and Tiger's armour was improved.

The *Renown* class was not even designed in 1914, and the major armor upgrade (apart from an expedient wartime horizontal upgrade after Jutland) was after WWI. *Tiger* never saw a belt upgrade or any other type of significant armor upgrade. More on armor later. 

>The Courageous class carried next to no armour, because they were designed to be as light as possible, for service in the shallower Baltic Coast, again Fisher's Baltic plan.

Think about this for a second. How much sense does it make to order three very expensive (both financially and in resources) “not-capital ships” in wartime that will undoubtedly serve for two decades for a proposed plan that has not been approved with no other use after said plan or if said plan is not approved? If the Baltic Project hasn’t been approved, why on earth would Parliament approve three ships just for that project? I know of no production plan by any nation on this scale that is so short sighted, even when specialized for one type of combat ships are flexible enough to adapt, so to claim this was the sole reason for the class makes zero sense. 

Also, for similar loading, the draft difference was not that much from *Renown*. Campbell notes the former ship’s deep load draft was 29’9” forward, 29’7” aft, and while his *Courageous* drafts are for normal displacement (19,320 tons, 23’3” forward and 23’5” aft), using the sinkage of 89 tons/inch we can adapt them to deep load: 26’5” forward, 26’7” aft for a deep load of 22,690 tons. That doesn’t give you much in terms of shallow water capabilities. 

As for armor, the *Courageous* class was rather well armored in certain areas. They had nearly identical barbette and turret armor as *Renown* and the flat deck armor was similar, moving a quarter inch from the main to forecastle deck (now a uniform 1.75” rather than the varying 1.5-1.75” on *Renown*). 

The only poorly armored part of the ship was the side armor, which ties quite nicely into *Renown*. The 13.5” battlecruisers had used a 9” belt over machinery, (usually) 5” by forward and aft guns, and with a 6” upper belt. *Renown* dispensed with the upper belt and used a uniform 6” belt from forward to aft barbettes, with the same 4” bulkheads. The barbettes were thinned slightly above the armor belt, but identical below. *Courageous* had a thinner belt (2” on 1” plating) and a bit thinner bulkheads (3” by barbettes), but identical barbettes. 

This coincides with the known British armor penetration tests that showed for impacts over 30° on face-hardened armor, shells were prone to shatter. Quoting a 1910 memo via Navweaps:

>From the trials with AP shell with cap so far carried out by the Ordnance Board against KC armour, it is clear that when striking at angles greater than 20deg to the normal there is very little chance of any AP shell in the service carrying its burster through such armour at any fighting range, as the shell would break up in passing through the armour. Generally speaking[,] capped AP shell, even when filled with salt, may be expected to beak up when striking KC armour of half caliber thickness at 30deg to the normal.

>It is submitted that this tendency of AP shell to break up at angles over 20deg to the normal may be an important factor in determining the distribution of armour in future ships as when AP shell, filled Lyditte, break up on striking such armour [and an] explosion and not [a] detonation takes place with very much smaller all-round effect

This helps explain the reduction in armor for *Renown*. A 6” belt would break up 12” German shells, presumably with this same flaw, with only a slight target angle well within operational norms (armor efficiency studies generally go to 60° from normal, the normal turret train limits, though can go higher). This also partially explains the *Courageous* decision: her belt was made from homogeneous armor, which has even better oblique performance as it’s likely to reject a shell intact rather than let the fragments penetrate. I’ll let Nathan Okun explain, in the context of a French armor decision a decade later:

>French naval designers decided during the 1930's that steeply-falling armor-piercing aircraft bombs would be more of a threat than more shallow impacts by medium-to-long-range naval gun projectiles and they therefore had face-hardened armor used for all plates over 4"" (10.2cm) on turret and conning tower roofs where layered protection (spaced decks) was not possible. To my knowledge, no other nation did this. Ironically, while this idea turned out to be absolutely true in almost every case in World War II, the one case where a French main turret roof - a 5.91"" (15cm) roof plate on the battle-cruiser DUNKERQUE - was hit was not by an aircraft bomb, but by a 15"" (38.1cm) 1938-pound hard-capped armor-piercing projectile at about 70-75° obliquity fired by the HMS HOOD at close range. The projectile broke in half and the nose ricocheted off, but the projectile lower body did not ricochet and the plate ended up with a large, projectile-shaped hole in it (it actually seems to be an outline of the British projectile on its side pushed into the plate!), throwing a large amount of plate material into the turret at high velocity, followed by the lower portion of the projectile, which then exploded (probably a less-than-full-strength explosion, but what difference did it make?) inside the turret, knocking out the right half of the split 4-gun mount (each turret was divided by heavy internal armored bulkheads into two adjacent 2-gun turrets on one mount, a unique French design). If the armor had been homogeneous, the projectile would have ricocheted off in one piece and probably no armor would have been ejected from the plate hit.

With this context, and recognizing the speed advantage allowing the *Courageous* class to run from superior opponents, the belt armor is consistent with these shell tests. The barbettes, however, would present more of a flat target even when heavily angled, thus they were identical to the *Renown* barbettes unless behind armor. I’ll also add the original design for the Admiral class used an 8” belt, a bit over half the caliber of the new German 38cm ships, and upgrading to 12” was one of the most significant post-Jutland modifications. 

Normally I’d spend more time on this, but I must go and have to cut it short and be less detailed than I’d like. That should provide you time to reply to these points."

The *Indefatigable* class was much more suited to overseas operations, the last two named *Australia* and *New Zealand* for this reason, while the *Lion* class was much more geared for fleet work. 

When viewed in that light, and with the context of the flawed ammunition tests that led to the thinner belt on *Renown* and *Courageous* and the constraints of wartime production, it appears clear that these ships were the next generation of ""light battlecruiser"" as Campbell calls it, though second class battlecruiser also works IMO.

WarshipPorn,ff304vc,t3_er71yv,1579530078.0,"I have recently been going through some DOD authorization and appropriation documents for more insights on the Cold War Navy. While often dull, there are some interesting points, including discussions on battleships. 

In Part 8 of the 1986 request, there are several statements similar to the one below, some in prepared statements and some in the Q&A part of the hearings. I find this one the best example, between ice Adm. James A. Lyons, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans, Policy, and Operations, and Senator Cohen:

Senator COHEN. Earlier this week Admiral Baggett testified that we are using battleships today to provide some relief from having to use carrier battle groups. Can you give me an example?

>Admiral LYONS. One of the specific things we are looking at——

>Senator COHEN. Give me an example of what has been done in the past year.

>Admiral LYONS. We certainly have used the battleship down in the Caribbean and Central America region in lieu of a carrier deployment there. We formed a surface ship action group with the battleship as the centerpiece. But let me give you some other examples that we are looking at.

>For example, once we get to greater regional stability, let's say, in Southwest Asia, I would foresee—and we are looking at various options—where we would take a battleship surface action group and move it into the Indian Ocean in lieu of possibly a carrier. Of course, coupled with this option would be the movement in land-based tactical air, such as the U.S. Air Force, and if not the U.S. Air Force, then operating with the Marine tactical air. We are looking at combinations like that, and to me, depending on the threat of the existing situation, this is a very viable alternative.

>Another example that we are looking at is when the USS *Midway* goes into its selected restricted availability [SRA] maintenance and repair period, perhaps in conjunction with the *Midway* Air Wing, we can use a battleship surface action group as the centerpiece in lieu of the *Midway*. 

>We are moving toward more flexibility and innovative employment of our resources as long as it is consistent with our national objectives for that particular region.

Several Admirals said the same thing, most in prepared statements. Other areas make it quite clear that this was in large part due to the Tomahawk capability: ""At the end of calendar year 1984 there were 14 Tomahawk platforms certified with an additional 14 scheduled to be certified in calendar year 1985.""

Four years later, in the FY 1990 hearings, there is this exchange between the CNO Admiral Trost and Representative Dicks:

>Mr. Dicks. Some have suggested that battleships and surface action groups could act in place of some carrier deployments if there were a reduction from 15 groups to 13. Would it be more appropriate to suggest the battleships better allow the Navy to meet commitments that would fit within the gap between the 15 battle groups we have and the 20 that JCS says are required?

>Admiral Trost. The four battleship battle groups that we have in being are best seen as a complement to the carrier battle-group capability. There are occasions when the air threat is minimal, when a battleship battle group with an Aegis cruiser could operate in low intensity environment and carry out the President's mission or power projection requirements in that area. If it is a higher air threat environment, it cannot.

>The best example of employment is perhaps the experience in the Persian Gulf. The carrier battle group provided the necessary mobile air cover while the battleship provided the essential impregnable capability to sail in harm's way. That included large cruise missiles launched from shore launchers and still provided the presence and, if you will, the stabilizing influence in that area.

>Mr. Dicks. The key is you have to have air superiority in order to defend the surface ships.

>Admiral Trost. You generally do in most areas. In areas where the air threat is lighter, the surface ships have sufficient anti-air warfare capability to accommodate them.

While much of the detail in these statements is quite similar, battleships can replace carriers in low threat areas provided there's land-based air cover but a carrier is necessary for the higher threat areas, the context is very different. In the FY 1986 hearings, the Navy promoted deploying battleships in lieu of carriers for lower threat missions, at a time when we had 15 carriers, while in the FY 1990 hearings they argued against it."

Compared to the 65+ turnout of 66.1%, this means that for every 3 voting-age citizens in an age group, only one younger voter will show up for every two older voters. Sanders is fighting an uphill battle, as he’s popular with a group that doesn’t show up and turns off those who do.

WarshipPorn,fetry6l,t1_felznjq,1579379264.0,">At the least, the Leays and Belknaps, with their 9.7 and 9.9:1 length:beam ratios are Cruisers.

The length to beam ratio is only one metric to judge hull characteristics. For example, *Introduction to Naval Architecture* list ""Typical Form Coefficients"" for several types of ship, and two have very similar length to beam ratios: 9.82 and 9.67. I think we can both agree that Destroyers and Great Lakes Bulk Freighters use radically different hulls.

Using the waterline rather than overall length is a better representation of the L/B ratio, and *Naval Architecture* uses length between perpendiculars (which in most cases is near identical to LWL, to the point you’ll usually find one or the other and rarely both). In this case, the *Leahy* class comes out as 9.36, nearly identical to the 9.38 of the *Gearings* and close to the 9.30 of *Fletcher*. *Belknap* comes out as 9.56, a bit high but not unusually so. For reference, *Long Beach* was 9.27. All values calculated from Friedman, and all but the last come from his *US Destroyers*.

These should show that hull form is more complex than merely the L/B ratio. One must also examine the hull coefficients, as both block and midships coefficients for cruisers are generally higher than for destroyers. Unfortunately, Friedman does not include these for the post-WWII ships except *Mitscher* and *Norfolk*, so we cannot make a fair comparison of the values using available information. However, he is quite clear that the *Farragut*, *Leahy*, and *Belknap* class all used the *Mitscher* hull as a starting point (particular evident in the first case), with changes as the designs went along (such as the need for greater endurance on *Leahy*, creating a larger ship with a redesigned stern to reduce transom immersion at 20 knots).

Thus we can say quite safely that no postwar US “cruiser” used a cruiser hull and thus traditional cruisers are dead. 

However, the term itself need not die. Cruisers evolved in the postwar world, and while they took much more influence from destroyers and can be considered large destroyers, they did slowly adopt cruiser features as the last traditional cruisers were retired. Thus, while I may acknowledge you can argue the modern ships are not cruisers (if you argue traditional cruisers were the last such ships), I personally find the term “cruiser” quite applicable for the ships in question and useful as a distinction between types of surface combatant, even though most are based on former destroyer characteristics at this point. 

You cite one of these evolving roles in your comparisons:

>Belknap was 5th Fleet Flagship for years, foreign station Flagships are traditionally Cruiser roles.

Fleet flagships are a traditional cruiser role, and [as this history shows](https://www.usslittlerock.org/sixth_fleet.html) after WWII cruisers were 6th Fleet Flagships until 1980. At that point things changed, with the flag transferring to the destroyer tender *Puget Sound* and the modified amphib *Coronado*. After her reconstruction due to the collision and fire, *Belknap* was primarily an experimental ship, but she was rebuilt into a fleet flagship in 1985-1986, and has been the only surface combatant to have the role since 1980. Thus, while she took on a traditional cruiser role, the role evolved to the point cruisers did not need to fill it. 

Backing up a bit:

>Dale was commissioned when I was in and she is very consipicuously unlike the Ticos, she was in a Cruiser Division or functioned as a DesRon squadron leader. 

The latter is not an argument for calling her a cruiser, as former US destroyer squadron leaders included *Porter* and *Somers* class destroyers. 

Unfortunately, there is very little available on post-WWII US Fleet Organization and I have to piece different sources together, so I cannot comment on any trends for any US ship after WWII due to how fragmentary my few sources are (it’s hard to find when or even if certain ships were part of naval reserve units, never mind squadrons for active ships). If you have anything on which ships were in certain units at a given time, especially those you served on, that would be extremely helpful. 

>They all functioned as Cruisers, had Cruiser hull forms, and were designated Cruisers formally and that's how the Navy treated and used them.

To summarize, cruiser functions changed and are not definitive (all these ships were carrier escorts, but so were some destroyers like *Farragut* and *Kidd*), did not have cruiser hull forms, and while officially classified cruisers after the 1975 reorganization, official classifications are often not definitive (such as the pre-1975 classification of these ships as frigates)."

At the time, the US deployed six carriers to the region: *Midway*, *Ranger*, and *Roosevelt* in the Persian Gulf, *Kennedy* and *Saratoga* in the Red Sea, and *America* initially in the Red Sea but later in the Gulf. Combined with the land based air forces, the relatively weak aircraft capability of the *Clemenceau* class even compared to *Midway*, and the benefits of having carrier operations under a single organization with similar aircraft, and the decision to use *Clemenceau* as an LPH and vehicle ferry is perfectly reasonable."

For example, concentrating anti-submarine assets in an area where you know submarines will be in a week, staging diversions to ensure the enemy concentrates their forces where you will not attack, or, in this case, preventing the German surface fleet from using French bases so the Allies could deploy their Atlantic forces more appropriately. 

Without intelligence and asymmetric warfare, you need far more men and material to win. With them, a smaller and/or less capable force, properly deployed, can defeat a larger and/or more powerful one."

WarshipPorn,fenkgvz,t1_fenj1cn,1579286616.0,"I imagine it’s partially due to the fact we no longer have a gun between 57mm and 127mm in the Navy inventory, as the OTO-Melara 76mm is only on a couple dozen rather old Coast Guard cutters. As we’ve decided the 5”/62 is not necessary on this ship (though other nations use similar weapons on ships this size), it’s simpler to go small and streamline ammunition, spare parts, production, and training. 

However, I do have one caveat. The US Navy will almost certainly transition to a new type of main gun during the next 20 years, potentially a smaller and less powerful railgun. Assuming they make a suitable gun that can be retrofitted to existing ships, say a 6MW gun in 2030, that might be a future area for growth on these ships. That would then suggest using a cheap gun in the interim with plans to exchange it in the future. 

So far as I know there is nothing hinting at this, and it’s very speculative and could be wrong. It is only a theory that happens to fit the facts."

WarshipPorn,femxgdo,t1_femq125,1579272135.0,">My suspicion for Bainbridge and Truxtun is that it was planned for neither

There are enough sources from the early 1980s that we can be confident NTU was planned for the ships at some point, but they were dropped later. [This is one such source](https://i.imgur.com/ig5I8gs.png), one of the most clear, but you'll find that 31 ship number floating around in other sources from the period (though some say 31 Terrier ships rather than 31 overall, clearly including the *Farraguts* that were dropped early on). While *Bainbridge* and *Truxtun* are not explicitly listed, they have to be included with their conventional counterparts for there to be 21 Terrier ships.

At some point, the two ships were dropped from the program, though as yet I don't know when. As *Bainbridge* would be reaching end of service, she may have been dropped completely (though *Long Beach* was slated for the upgrade and only had a 30 year expected service life as built, but based on this upgrade would have gone longer than the 36 she actually did). Earlier in the Hearings there is a line stating all non-nuclear NTU overhauls after FY 1988 would be completed, which may be our clue, but it cites Admiral Pyatt in a prior hearing that I don't have (yet). *Truxtun* is more interesting, but that rolls into:

>As near as I can tell the decision to not refuel and instead get rid of the CGNs was made some time in 1993, so the absence of Arkansas is puzzling, but it may have been a factor that the intended date was outside of the planning window for that particular document.

A viable theory, though I must wonder if they were planning on a more significant upgrade. As she was the last of the four to need refueling, the Navy could trial a more extensive refit for this ship, possibly a version of the AEGIS *Virginia* that had been tossed around for CGN-42 or an NTU with Mk 41 (later in the hearings they discuss $120 million for ""VLS upgrades"", including $67 million for ""ROH"", as part of the budget, but no ships are listed). If that is the case, *Truxtun* may also have been slated for such an upgrade, as the *Belknap* cousins would have seen longer service after receiving NTU. 

I'll see what else I can find."

>There were only two of them: California and South Carolina, and they outlasted all of the other nuke cruisers by several years. The others were either never slated to get it or were decommissioned prior to or during their overhauls when they were supposed to have gotten it. 

I was doing some research on this topic yesterday as I found some disagreement on which ships actually had NTU (but what I found confirms what you said here: only the two *Californias* were actually upgraded, some *Virginias* decommissioned during the upgrade/refueling). However, as part of the DOD appropriations hearings for FY 1990, I found [this table of planned dates](https://i.imgur.com/Xb4FMMM.png). While I have not checked planned vs. actual dates for any ship, this does give a good idea of the plan as of these hearings. 

The only three nuclear cruisers not listed here are *Bainbridge* CGN-25, *Truxtun* CGN-35, and *Arkansas* CGN-41. I am very confident the latter would eventually get the upgrade package, but at present I have found no solid evidence the first two were still on the program at this time, though some earlier sources do indicate they were planned for the upgrade in the early 1980s. I will continue to look for information on when they were dropped, it may be in the appropriations that I have barely scratched the surface of."
WarshipPorn,feluxw0,t1_felf9h7,1579231566.0,"My favorite Gulf War *Iowa* story. 

>Saddam Hussein's military incursion into Kuwait in 1991 provided the ideal proving ground for Pioneer UAV units to prove their worth. About 40 U. S. Navy, Marine, and Army Pioneers flew more than 300 missions during Operation Desert Storm. The Navy flew Pioneers from the battleships ""Iowa"" and ""Wisconsin"" and three Marine Corps Remotely Piloted Vehicle (RPV) companies used their Pioneers to identify targets for marine artillery units and to correct their shot. The Army also deployed one UAV platoon to aid army artillery in the same manner as the Marine UAV units.

>Navy Pioneers conducted 71 missions and flew a total of 232 hours during the conflict. These aircraft allowed their operators to detect, and helped vector forces to intercept, two Iraqi high-speed patrol boats menacing the fleet. They also became the eyes of naval gunners who successfully bombarded Faylaka Island. It was during this bombardment that the international media spotlight fell on the Pioneer. Crewmen aboard the battleship ""Wisconsin"" launched a Pioneer, Air Vehicle number 159, to conduct battle damage assessment after shells from the ""Missouri's"" massive 41-cm (16-inch) guns. As operators flew the Pioneer low over Faylaka Island, a number of Iraqis realized the battleship was probably preparing to fire another volley. They waved white surrender flags as the UAV passed overhead. U. S. Marines landed and collected the waiting prisoners. This event marked the first time that humans had surrendered to a robot in combat. When Navy officials offered to transfer a Pioneer to the Smithsonian Institution, curators at the National Air and Space Museum specifically asked for the UAV that Iraquis troops surrendered to during the Gulf War."
