selfimprovement,fefi5cf,t3_eokf9y,1579056812.0,"Sometimes we wait and wait. For example, I go out more when i have a car, ill find myself a gf when i graduate, i need to make more money first, etc. Perfectionism can make you work harder and sometimes motives you to get the best, but perfectionism also stops you from executing when you think youre not prepare. In reality, we have to embrace messiness. Maybe we believe our life is not in aligment or that it is a chaos. Well, we gotta embrace that chaos and take action no matter what. If you feel out of shape, it doesnt mean you cant take action and do other things while you work out. Age should not stop you. If you still want something is because you can get it. You have to believe you deserve, not just want, but deserve what you want. Never is too late to take action. Dont wait"
GetMotivated,fcvia30,t3_eiya31,1578002667.0,"Be more afraid of excuses coz excuses are generally ways ur mind trick you to keep you safe but if you think about it theres nothing to fear in most situations. Once you find yourself in certain situations, youll see you dont crack under pressure. Youll feel confidence once you take action. Our body reacts the same whether we are afraid or excited. If you experience a little anxiety stop, breathe, and tell yourself you are excited to do something awesome instead of being afraid. Take action no matter what happens youd still be okay. You are confident. Confidence will lead to competence which will lead to more confidence. No more excuses"
