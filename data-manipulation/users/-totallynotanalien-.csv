iamatotalpieceofshit,ff4xxwb,t3_erhe4v,1579575119.0,Honestly I have really bad plane anxiety (mostly because of how many have crashed) and one thing that freaks me out is when people deliberately pull down the blind after being told to leave it up for take off and landing. I had an anxiety attack on a plane because the guy in front of me kept pulling it down and he laughed at me because I was crying. The air hostess came and told him off like 5 times before he finally listened.

I live on the other end of the world from my s/o but I could imagine marrying him and spending a large chunk of my life away from family because honestly I think I could have a great life with him. But my biggest fear has always been having kids with him in the (distant) future and my mum not being involved at all would devastate me. But honestly it‚Äôs tough but you‚Äôve got great things to look forward to like living a life in a different country that most people would never experience and ultimately you could go through stages in your adult life where you spend large periods of time away from family but then again there‚Äôs texts and skype and plane trips get shorter and cheaper over time. Yeah I don‚Äôt know what my point was but I honestly wish you good luck in your future with your s/o, it‚Äôs not a mean choice you‚Äôre making but deserved happiness you‚Äôre allowing yourself to have by moving closer to your s/o."

My boyfriend lives half across the world from me and I had to decide whether it was worth it because I knew we may go up to a year not seeing each other.
