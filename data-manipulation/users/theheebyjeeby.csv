todayilearned,fec9kxn,t1_fe6sprs,1578969090.0,Hopefully some minds have been expanded a tiny bit :-)
todayilearned,fec78pf,t1_fe6pamf,1578967854.0,So true. And your example only seems crazy if you're not the one who is living inside the craziness - then it seems like the most perfectly clear logic.
todayilearned,fec6fhm,t1_fe6m8j9,1578967424.0,"Thank you :-) I think I'm doing better. At that time I didn't even realise I had depression. It was everything else in my life that was terrible, it surely couldn't just be that my is brain broken! Now I can admit it is depression. Naming a thing helps.

Side note - realising this has made me get annoyed at those memes you see around the internet saying ""it's okay to ask for help"" around depression. Maybe it's true for some people, but there way no way for me to ask for help cause it didn't feel like a problem with me but with everything else. I think the memes should be more like ""it's okay to ask a friend if they're okay"" :-)"
todayilearned,fe6drvi,t1_fe68wzf,1578887942.0,"So, I had the experience of *almost* being this person a few months ago. I can't really explain properly what was happening to me, but I had this amazing moment of clarity in that I realised that I could fix everything, for everyone. The feeling of it was the complete opposite of what you describe - I can make things better for everyone I know if I jump in front of this train. It was a profound sense of relief that I'd finally found how to fix things. I'd almost go as far to say happiness. It was so simple and I could do it, and it would 'fix' everything. But I took too long to get over to the tracks and the train went past. I was so angry at myself I cried the rest of the day. 

The reason for choosing that was just that I was near the tracks, and the thought occurred to me. The thought was so overwhelming there was really no choice, and obviously there was nothing remotely close to an objective analysis of what I was doing. I had suddenly figured out a way of removing the terrible pain, so I just ran to it as fast as I could.

Perhaps you could think about it like having a super painful toothache that goes one for months. ALL you can think of is getting rid of the toothache. It makes you act highly selfish and irrational because you just want to get to the dentist and get the damn tooth pulled. Well, imagine that you have a super painful life-ache and all you can think of is getting rid of the life-ache. EVERYTHING pales in comparison.

I'm not completely disagreeing with you here - because just reading this thread is making me realise even more the horror what what I was about to do. Not the horror for myself, but to the poor driver (and, to be fair, everyone in my life). But depression is just really that bad that reality can be turned upside down in your own head. 

It definitely doesn't excuse things like this. There is no excuse. But I think it helps explains it?"
