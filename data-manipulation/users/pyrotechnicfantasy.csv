fnki,ffjxha5,t1_ffjgbrc,1580009643.0,"A ninjago RWBY crossover, as I live and breathe?

A team of four fighters, led by a red-themed brash protagonist, flanked by a white ice mage, the protag’s sister, the sister’s love interest (who uses a flexible weapon and is a dual wielder), and led by a surprisingly ancient old man. 

During a long standing feud between the ancient old man and their darker, evil, black-oil themed counterpart, the heroes end up finding a young green-themed boy who has to grow up quickly and become the chosen one. 

The evil protagonist seeks to bring together four magic golden artefacts. 

Society is racist towards the human/animal hybrids, causing the oppressed species to mostly seclude themselves and live separately from the humans.

It opened up a new area of the Tower, it introduced Light Level advantages in PvP, new weapons, a whole new branch of lore, Saladin was mysterious and golden, brand new weapons - THAT’s why it felt different back in D1. It was as different to regular gameplay as Gambit or Comp is today"

Yes, sometimes enemies are too powerful to kill in one go (Like Captains and Polemarchs) so you have to be creative, e.g. lure them into lighting the signal fire, which then explodes. Or assassinate then for big damage, blind them, hide, them assassinate again.

Yes, they are despicable. Yes, they are evil for using that salute. But we do not live in a society where it is okay for anyone to hand out vigilante justice based on a photo. 

What happens if they beat up someone who looks like one of the photographed people? What if one of them is a twin? Perhaps one of the people in this photo was incredibly against doing the salute, and did so because of peer pressure - do they deserve to be attacked? What if someone goes and kills one of them and then we have a murder to deal with?

What happens when the next photo gets released, but it's photoshopped, and innocent people get attacked in the street for someone they never did? 

I'm not defending these people, they're evil. But we have a legal system to punish them correctly. It's not the general public's place to do so and that is a very slippery slope to slide down."
