Avenue5,ff7dlik,t1_ff6gx34,1579647102.0,"Well the short version is I work around a lot of silicon valley tech people, so the Josh Gad character is too fucking real in a lot of ways.  Its just a personal thing, not a real judgement on the show."
Avenue5,ff3ews8,t1_ff39tzh,1579539667.0,"Yeah... a lot of this was too conceptually terrifying for me to really see the humor in some of the other situations.  As an example: I know its supposed to be kind of slapstick funny when the gravity shifts sideways (?) and everyone falls into the wall,  but when its paired with a person actually getting stabbed to death I'm going to be taking the situation seriously and not really finding humor in it. The acupuncture part was just viscerally gross to me and not very funny.And I really agree that the idea of everyone trapped in this ship that is completely incompetently managed by a company that is trying to minimize its losses... too real and too terrifying.I did enjoy some of the other jokes and dialogue and I plan to keep watching. I think I'm just getting whiplash from the tone and once I understand what this show is going for I can enjoy it more."

(Again- im not trying to say this in a mean way. None of us are this special and if we were we’d be making careers out of it.) 

Similarly, if you visited a different state/city/country, people could identify you from where you’re from by your fashion. 


I get what you’re saying, and I agree that well made timeless stuff is always going to age well and you’re less likely to be dressed exactly like someone else.... but fashion is still a tool of culture and it’s about fitting in and identifying yourself as much as standing apart. It’s not something you can easily opt out of."

Core and yoga poses can definitely help tho."
gifsthatkeepongiving,fesbefd,t3_eqf4vz,1579363483.0,"Yeah unless you’re in  unique couture fashion someone else is going to be dressed like you. Fashion has been this way for hundreds of years.

RingFitAdventure,fendsta,t3_eq1ag9,1579282534.0,"When it comes to the game’s perception of how well you’re doing an exercise, your fire hair is a good indicator. If you think you’re doing it wrong but your in-game hair is burning white hot, the game thinks you’re doing it well. So with an guards, if your hair is burning white but you’re taking damage, that’s just how it is. Ab guards don’t completely block damage except at the beginning of the game."

bon_appetit,fde6vsw,t3_ekvfen,1578332489.0,"If you add salt during cooking it will diffuse throughout the food, making everything more flavorful. Since the salt is getting distributed throughout the food, its essentially getting diluted. Done properly, the flavor of the food is what comes out instead of the saltiness. (As others have said, they're also using kosher salt which volume-to-volume is less salty than table salt)

If you add salt at the end of cooking it only coats the food in salt, and that saltiness is what hits your tongue. The salt isn't distributed, its concentrated on the surface of food.

This means that if you add salt at the beginning of cooking you can also add more of it than if you can add it to the end. Knowing when to salt food at what stage of cooking makes a HUGE difference in cooking. Salting food during cooking, done properly, brings out the flavor in food without giving it a strong salty taste.

&#x200B;

If you're watching a BA recipe but you're only going to salt the food at the end of the process, you can use about a fourth (or less) of the salt that they are using. You also don't have to speculate about these recipes, you can actually prepare them and see for yourself."

Basically some cardio to get heart rate up and then all the stuff I hate doing in the adventure mode so I can get it out of the way and not worry about it later. Current set is mountain climbers, squats, planking, and other core workouts I can’t remember.

Yes the story is about non-native people vs indigenous people so Milo wouldn’t have to be white. They could all be aliens and Atlantis could be earth and it would be Independence Day. 

But the allegory of the story is still white/European settlers exploring/discovering/invading/colonizing America/Africa/India/Australia etc

I started playing a half-hour a day, five times a week, but moved it up an hour. (I also alternate playing ring fit with cardio in a bike sometimes) 
In two months my weight hasn’t changed much but my clothes are fitting better. I heard it takes six months of consistent workout for other people to notice you look different, and a year for a real physical change. It’s all about consistently plugging in time daily (with breaks!) you will definitely start to slowly and surely feel progress"

The musical is running for 38(?) years, it has strong brand recognition, Tom Hooper has some successes under his belt as a director, ‘realistic’ CGI is clearly seen as a safe choice, and it’s a franchise all ages can appreciate. 
If you’re just crunching numbers it seems like a very low-risk opportunity. I think Cats happened precisely because execs thought t wouldn’t be a risk. It was very carefully planned out, they just totally fucked it up"
