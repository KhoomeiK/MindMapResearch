HyperX,fexjt1y,t1_fexj6vc,1579432135.0,"While this is a big issue it made me a bit less worries seeing someone having the same exact issues. I just made another search and some people said to go to your sound options and disable your microphone completely. Even if it's not plugged in to your headset. But unfortunately  your only chances of fixing this issue is if you get an RMA and they ship one without any issues. Or buy another headset.... Kinda sucks when you buy something and get excited then it turns out to be the complete opposite. Good luck man! 

Here's the link if you want to get an RMA: https://www.hyperxgaming.com/us/support/rma-enduser"
HyperX,feximws,t1_fexibjh,1579431602.0,Nothing really I tried everything. My problem is whenever my volume is higher than 72 the static starts and when I turn on 7.1 surround sound it gets louder. I'm running on firmware 0030. I didn't find any fix or work around... I am beginning to think that we just bought the wrong headset.. because too many people on forums have this same exact issue.
HyperX,fexge1u,t3_equr1a,1579430554.0,Holy shit. I bought this headset a couple of days earlier too and I have the same issues. Go to they're support website and try to RMA it. There is no fix for it.

dankmemes,fd0gxpw,t3_ejoe3t,1578118630.0,Japan was kinda into anime but not in their modern technology that they have now. So it was already famous. Iran is famous for their flying carpets which will mean well be getting hentai on the carpets.
