Washington,ffdty1a,t1_ffdrzw0,1579828849.0,"I'm with you. If someone is going to try to kill, rob or rape me, or anything else, I'd much rather there were no guns involved so I could at least go down swinging instead of going down with a dumb ""is that a gun? "" look on my face."
Washington,ffdtl1x,t1_ffdgwgg,1579828596.0,"Which is basically what this report says. Do these two get released from jail/prison, step outside and immediately rob, punch, stab, litter or jaywalk? 
Hell, I guess if you're gonna be something, be the best you can. Right or wrong."
movies,ffb50tk,t3_eslw12,1579751966.0,"1st time seeing this sub so I apologize if I'm wrong with this but for me it's ""Paint Your Wagon"". I'm 41 and other than older people, my parents and such, I don't know of many people 45-50yrs and under have seen it. The movie is hilarious, peak Lee Marvin, young Clint Eastwood. It's kinda a musical, which I'm not a fan of, I love this movie."
Washington,ff78tnb,t1_ff68cao,1579643395.0,"I don't  think that a lot of the people just did not understand how fast everything would move once it started. The speed that the ash, lava/mudslides, trees shooting was ridiculous. I think people just figured shit would go straight up then slowly down not expecting the entire side of the mountain blowing out sideways. 
Or people are just extremely stupid. Could be a little of column A and a little of column B."
Seattle,ff5do7g,t1_ff4jx7r,1579588526.0,"Man, if stay away from having ""ducks"" anywhere in my title. A lotta people, especiallyoutta towners, only think of one thing when they hear ""Seattle + ducks"".
And it wasn't pretty."

Washington,fecciso,t1_fe6dxpe,1578970737.0,"I spent a year of college in misery,  St. Louis area, with people from Georgia, Oklahoma, Colorado, Wisconsin, basically from all over the country. Listening to them try to read and pronounce places like: Chelan, Wenatchee and Snohomish was amazing. And you can just fucking forget about Snoqualmie with them. Every state has Indian/tribal towns and places but for some reason they could not handle Washington names."
MurderedByWords,fe9xmas,t1_fe7opb7,1578942323.0,"Remember a simpler time when they were both just a punchline that you expected to hear about on shows like The Simpson's, Southpark and Family Guy?

She did get hit by a car, BUT, she could walk just fine until she saw a stranger, non family, then all of a sudden, she could barely walk. Picked up her front left leg(the one that broke) and hobble like she it just happened. Got her pets and moved on. I miss Nomie."

SeattleWA,fdmaer3,t1_fdm9wqc,1578543861.0,"Oh, you ""woke"" now? What the hell are you talking about. Never said I was smarter than anyone. 
Also don't try to put some fucking homophobic shit on me you stupid fuck. Just because I don't agree with you, I am 1: some know it all asshole and
2: some homophobic asshole. 
You give me that ""Alright, you're smarter than me"" shit then turn around and assume I'm homophobic? 
You figure it the fuck out.

Edit: Also, I can't be that fucking smart. I went to public schools, taught by your family."
SeattleWA,fdm9ljv,t1_fdm8eyl,1578543244.0,"Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Are you trying to tell me that a ratio of 1:1 is better than 35:1 when it comes to schools and education? Welp, shit, I'm done then. We should just let any ol person teach whoever, whatever, whenever they want. 
Also, nobody is making you ""subject"" your kid to anything. Just like the idiot anti-vaxxers. You CAN homeschool your kid, if it means that much you'll figure it out. You CAN deny vaccines to your kids if it means that much to you. 
That doesn't mean that your homeschooled child or your non vaccinated child can go and do whatever the hell they want."
SeattleWA,fdm79jt,t1_fdm5gal,1578541531.0,"Where to find a Washington-certified person to help? Hmmm? Where could they be? Maybe at the school. Get the kids vaccinated and send then to school. Not that tough to figure out. If you believe that you know better than research and doctors or research and teachers, then figure it the fuck out and don't whine about it being too tough. If you really believe in that, just like most things, not all, find a way. 
This isn't directed at you, as far as the anti-vaxxer stuff, but you either pick the lesser of 2 evils(in your mind) or come up with a better way. 
It should be difficult to homeschool."
SeattleWA,fdm00p9,t1_fdlyiop,1578536571.0,Seems reasonable. If you don't have some sort of checks and balances you end up with anti-vaxxers.
nfl,fdlxmkn,t3_elsnvo,1578534938.0,"Man, Porter wanted nothing to do with Lynch a second time. He coulda got back in there and made, or attempted to make, a play.

I woke up right as we were going over the bridge (heading towards I-90) when I opened my eyes the 1st thing I saw was just the river then nothing. Just a huge space before trees or anything else. As a kid just waking up it scared the hell outta me. It looked like some flat-earthers wet dream. It was a weird feeling."
Seahawks,fcmi18p,t1_fcm4k23,1577776076.0,Even bigger than hill being outta position is that Bradley doesn't trust him and tries to make up for hill and gets himself outta position. Bradley trusts Diggs and plays so much better when Diggs is on the field.

Seahawks,fcmh86v,t1_fcm18bd,1577775164.0,"In my opinion, it is more the fact that after last year and the NFL making a rule just to avoid this type of controversy, they didn't even stop the game to review it. I think it would have been easier for most  people to take, no matter the final ruling, if they at least used the rule in a situation that it was created for."
