I immediately knew it wasn’t real and rather than feel worried I was annoyed thinking “damnit I’m seeing things.. this is just going to distract me from working.” Crazy how are priorities can get so warped. 

And after that they stopped working me like that but the damage was done. I stopped coming into work on time, took off two months and recollected myself. Would have never been able to interview in that state of mind"

cscareerquestions,ffbz5pt,t3_est9wj,1579787336.0,This is a good realization to have and one I think a lot ought to learn. I was of the same mentality and then I reached my breaking point where I loss so much sleep I was having visual and auditory hallucinations. At that point I was essentially working for half of my salary. I’m still mad when I think about how that company treated me and disappointed how I let myself be treated. Just have to see it as a learning lesson and move on.

HalfLife,ff96l36,t1_ff93ztl,1579706048.0,Ah I see.
HalfLife,ff90nno,t1_ff8vml8,1579701844.0,Wait this isn’t fan made? Wow. That really is impressive if so
