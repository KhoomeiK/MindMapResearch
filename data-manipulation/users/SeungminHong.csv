If I want to go for convenience, I would use bluetooth headphones, but if I go for the sound quality, I would just use a USBC to 3.5mm DAC, because the sound processing is better than the DAC that comes with the phone."
YangForPresidentHQ,ff4ycd0,t3_ern6mo,1579575399.0,"Same here (ottawa). In my high school, 95% of those interested in US politics favors Yang over the other candidates, because his message is more relevant to the current and future world than the rest of the candidates. Maybe it's because our high school is STEM oriented, but our teachers have been emphasizing automation for years now, and Yang happened to show up at the right time"

Our first priority should be getting Yang to the white house, but the second priority is to spread Yang's vision of the future in any way, even if it's from another candidate. If other people bring up Yang's talking points, they are in a way validating Yang's message, and other people will come to take him more seriously"

YangForPresidentHQ,fcw63dy,t1_fcw1s0h,1578018006.0,"5G is not all about the high frequency bands. Yes, everyone is talking about the fast speeds 5G offers, but the fastest ones will be mmWave, but most 5G services will be done with frequencies very similar if not the same as the 4G we have today. As I did a little bit of work in a company who made cellular radios, there's a lot more to 5G than just the frequencies. 5G is fundamenally different starting from the roots, and the entire hardware architecture is improved. The rumor that 5G can somehow control our minds is completely BS, and if that were true, people would have made technology that can do just that, years ago, and it would be talked about a lot more. 5G isn't something the government does, as private companies produce everything, and the government just licenses a certain frequency range for the company to use. The reason Huawei is banned in the US, is not because they can control our minds, but because Huawei can monitor all the data that goes through their digital systems, and the race to 5G is more about not allowing China to all this data if countries use Chinese systems, not about who gets to crowd control."
