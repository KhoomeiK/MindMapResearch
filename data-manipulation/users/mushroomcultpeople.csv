Eyebleach,fc01qnv,t1_fbzkw7q,1577274045.0,"If by “suffer” you are referring to the worst practices of factory farming. I’m sure we’d be in agreement that it’s unnecessary suffering for marginal profit gains.

Raising a pig, or any other livestock, at a farm. Is not suffering by default. Any farmer worth their salt would want the animal killed quickly and with minimal suffering when the time has come.

I see no problems with that. Most livestock animals exist as they do because we explicitly bred them to be raised then eaten. Look to nature and you will find brutality way beyond."
