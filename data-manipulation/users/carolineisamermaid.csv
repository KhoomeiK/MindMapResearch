aww,ffa0wz7,t3_eser7p,1579725652.0,"One of my cats loves attention so much that as soon as anyone touches him he starts purring super loudly. Because of this the vet has never been able to listen to his heart properly.

Note: he gets TONS of attention at home,
he demands it. You couldn't ignore him if you tried."

MedicalGore,ff7vnrc,t1_ff7nszq,1579659447.0,I'm really sorry for your loss.
MedicalGore,ff7mj4m,t1_ff7gsvn,1579653113.0,"I've done that, this was my big ""hooray I have good insurance now"" moment and it backfired lol"
MedicalGore,ff7bvz4,t1_ff7bd81,1579645897.0,"I didn't think to ask a ton of questions...I was just ready to get rid of them and am terrified of needles so I was busy panicking over that instead of asking important questions that might of prevented this lol.
But you're the second person to mention phenol so y'all are probably right."
MedicalGore,ff7a1hs,t1_ff791t7,1579644276.0,"Yeah!  I kept getting nasty ingrown toenails on both sides of this toe. I went to see a podiatrist and he offered a ""permanent solution"" (ominous, I know!) where he would remove the ingrown part of the nail and then add a tiny bit of an acid (another user said it was silver nitrate and that sounds correct)  into the nail matrix to prevent the ingrown from coming back. 
He must of gotten pretty heavy handed on the one side though because I got this nasty burn that took months to recover from. The other side I had no issues with. 
To be fair though, the ingrown has not come back!"

cats,feb3j4l,t3_eo7ydp,1578955099.0,"Coworkers never get it, they expect you to get all excited about their human children but brush off your furry children.

It's like ""I get it Linda, you don't care that my cat can play fetch. I don't care that your baby started holding its head up, but we pretend for eachother!"""
insaneparents,fcnpmot,t1_fcnfgs6,1577816054.0,I doubt a woman who decorates her sick child with diced potatoes vaccinated them....
