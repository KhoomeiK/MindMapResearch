Are the other parents of children consenting to her getting a video?

How expensive do you think it would be for all bus videos to be redacted? Because you know all the parents want access to the videos? Also, it appears each child would need a different video since only other children are redacted?

You know redacted means blurring images of other children?"

Who is it you want to pay the $600?

Do you think redacting the video is required to protect the privacy of children? Or should privacy laws be loosened?

unpopularopinion,fee11hh,t1_fedwdth,1579024158.0,It undermines the contribution people make to society that aren’t measured in profits and wages. Forcing stay at home parents into the job market takes away from raising their children. You basically designed a system that rewards parents who abandon their children at home while they work.
