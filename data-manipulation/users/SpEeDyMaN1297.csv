AskReddit,ffhoj6b,t3_etcyd6,1579945481.0,I think that 'feminists' should stop telling men to cry and show their feelings but when they do they make fun of men for 'being tough' but acting weak. Start taking mens mental health seriously and not to just say 'man up'. Women are more likely to get mental health issues but men suffer more.

Also richie (bill hader) getting caught in the dead lights was so good. His performance was so good."
pennywisetheclown,ffcjh73,t1_f6uirt2,1579800774.0,"I think the mirror maze scene was great as well. But it was nice seeing skarsgårds emotional acting and the element of surprise in the Mickey scene
P.s the mrs kirsh scene was a bit rubbish with the effects and fear involved. It'll definitely look outdated 15 to 20 years in the future."
pennywisetheclown,ffcj1qh,t3_dv3rwk,1579800515.0,I always had the 'I know your secret' scene in my head so I'd randomly turn into pennywise and basically cover everyone around me in spit.
pennywisetheclown,ffciukx,t3_e7lebf,1579800396.0,"I must say that the first one was better all round but the second one had some spectacular scenes like the final one, the mirror maze one, and the vicky one (I loved skarsgårds emotional acting in it)."
