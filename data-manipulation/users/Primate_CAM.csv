deafheaven,fdhhpna,t1_fdhf0iq,1578422880.0,"Hell yeah brother, either way im certain I'll have a blast, I've only been to a few concerts my entire life, and I caught deafheaven when they were touring with This will destroy you, and that was my first time ever hearing about them, so you could imagine how that went. my only regret is that I had to leave right before they ended the show with pecan tree, hopefully that will still be part of the setlist! I'm going to see them in Houston but I was very tempted to go Dallas in january, it's just that they are fantastic live"
indieheads,fdhc7jm,t1_fdgrigr,1578419779.0,I like it like this cuz it separates the ones who have self control from the weak /s but at the same time not /s
deafheaven,fdg2ris,t3_el6rjw,1578377865.0,"This is the only problem (that happens with every band) that the setlist will most likely not increase in lengths an there will be more songs to choose from so all of my favorites from the 2nd and 3rd album will slowly get pushed out for newer ones, which is cool but it means you better go to every show you can for a better chance to get to see the songs you want"

Do you mean that if I select the option were it would be 3 dollars for one month, instead of 30 for a year, then it would give me the option to pay w/o PayPal?"
spotify,fd99tkt,t1_fd8t5pf,1578230481.0,I don't understand why they don't let you pay thru not PayPal... That's the only reason why I'm not a sub to last.fm (LET ME GIVE YOU MY MONEY)

3DS,fcjahb7,t3_ehat2j,1577681358.0,"last game i bought for the 3ds, and maybe the last one forever, was pokemon ultrasun, and im very glad that i did because it completely changed the way i felt about the gen 7 games, i still dont know why but when i first played through moon i completely hated it i wanted to die every second that went on, the music was just unbearable. All of that might have been because i was just not in the mood for it, but i think what made me fall in love with the ultra sun games is that i changed the way i was playing through a pokemon game, i dont know exactly why but I started just focusing on raising my pokemon actually paying attention trying to undertand a pokemon since the beggining, from looking at its stats very early on, enjoying the begginng of the journey, which might seem tedious , which i think it all started since x and y released, i only ever focused on rushing through to get on with it, while i missed so many details. And im still not finished with the game yet I still have to beath the elite 4 :)"
