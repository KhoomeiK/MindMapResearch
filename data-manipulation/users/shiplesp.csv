The trick to sticking to a food budget is (1) menu planning - plan out your meals for the entire week; (2) shopping from the list you create from your plan; and (3) not wasting food - either eating leftovers or reinventing leftover food into something different.

The first two help you decide what to buy, which can certainly fit within your budget, and the third will prevent you from dumping your food money into the bin.

First, clean all accident spots with a good enzymatic pet odor eliminator.  Be especially diligent with the carpet because likely the odor has soaked in.

1.  FREQUENT leashed trips outside ... more frequent than you believe she needs.  Always err on the side of too frequent vs. not often enough.  Make sure she empties herself (some dogs need to go more than once to empty), and while you're at it, try putting the behaviors on cue.  Reward appropriate elimination.

2.  Attentive supervision inside.  Your eyes must be on her with attention when she is loose inside.  If you are likely to get distracted, leash her to you so she can't wander off to toilet.

3.  Containment (crate or pen or small, secure dog-proofed room) whenever you can't supervise with attention.  I know ""I'll only be gone a minute to check the mail,"" but that's when you either bring the dog with you or put her in her crate/space.

Dogtraining,ff9kv4o,t3_escj4m,1579715137.0,"The first step in any behavior modification task is to manage the dog's environment so he can't self-reward by practicing the behavior (practice makes perfect).  You can and should certainly train when you are there to redirect, but unless you prevent that self-rewarding from being possible, it is pretty much shoveling sand at the seashore.  

So ... do set up gates and keep counters clear.  The dog is only allowed in the kitchen when someone is actively supervising and then, if he shows any interest (well before he jumps up to investigate), use your ""leave it"" cue and reward.  You'll have to get everyone on board with this and you will all have to stay consistent if you want to change this behavior.

Dogtraining,ff9jvpk,t3_esdll7,1579714558.0,"Sounds like redirected aggression.  Your dog can't get to the object of his concern, so he's releasing that pent up arousal on your other dog.  You're not going to like my suggestion, which is to walk your dogs separately and work on this dog's reactivity.  What I would do is train a rock solid, joyful, competition-quality heel with attention in the house and your yard, and gradually introduce it into the outside world.  You want it to become a game that your dog LOVES to perform because you reward like a drunken sailor on shore leave.  Then, when *you* (before your dog notices) see a dog in the distance, cue the behavior and use it to get past the other dog (or head away).  The biggest problem that people often have with on-leash reactivity is that they wait until their dog is actually reacting to head it off.  You need training and a strategy to use *before* she reacts.

I won't allow it to be any fun for her (easy to disengage and not interact since I'd be half asleep), but I would respect her request to go outside - short and sweet.

I do this because the ONE time you don't respond is the time she has the urgent need (explosive diarrhea?) and she is forced to eliminate inside.  It's not worth it.  I want my dog to be able to communicate what he needs ... I will just be judicious about reinforcing any extraneous or manipulative behavior.

Dogtraining,ff9ia2r,t3_ese8pf,1579713602.0,"The clicker is meant to mark the behavior you like and want repeated, whatever it is.  Generally, when we clicker train, we don't ""add the cue"" for the behavior until well after the behavior is perfect.  For instance, in training a puppy to sit, we can either lure a sit or wait for a sit to happen.  We click the instant the butt touches the ground, and reward (tossing a treat will ""reset"" the puppy for the next repetition).  You can, likewise, ""catch"" your puppy doing something you like, and click (or mark using a marker word, if you don't have a clicker handy) and reward.  And, for the record, an hour of training is WAAYY TOO LONG to train a young puppy.  Five minute sessions, throughout the day is likely to lead to less frustration.

Dogtraining,ff7yvcu,t3_es0bh3,1579661647.0,"Nope.  Rabbit = lunch to the mix you have.  Not going to ever happen.  A rabbit can have a heart attack and die from fright, so really just keep them completely apart - the rabbit in a room that the dog cannot enter."
Dogtraining,ff7ypxd,t3_es0ekb,1579661543.0,"Stay out longer.  There really is no other way that I know of to break that logjam than to simply outstubborn your puppy.  It's not fun, but you won't have to do it forever."
Dogtraining,ff7y7cy,t3_es485m,1579661181.0,"1.  I would begin to ""shape"" toward more calm and unexcited behavior by rewarding gradually more and more calm/less aroused presentation.  It's an art, not a science, so it will depend on your observational skills and timing.

2.  Yeah, I think that's a fail.  The point is for relaxation in the face of distractions, so maybe you're working too fast for her?

3.  Behavior chains are broken by time, so if you put time between the barking and the reward, you won't be rewarding the barking, but instead rewarding the quiet/calm.  

4.  Toss a treat when you say ""all done"" and tell him to ""get it""?"
Dogtraining,ff7xokn,t3_es4b1w,1579660820.0,"You can't leave a new puppy home alone for 10 hours ... you need to have someone come in once or twice a day to toilet the puppy and play with him.  Once he has matured a bit, he can handle the time alone, but right now he can't.  He's terrified."
Dogtraining,ff7xiff,t3_es4y3y,1579660704.0,"At this point you need a system of ""crate and rotate"" so that the dogs are never out at the same time.  Then bring in a good trainer.  This kind of aggression (where there is the risk of death to one dog) is not a self-help problem.  Bring in a professional.  In the meantime, be diligent about keeping them apart."

dogs,ff7wicf,t3_es2ax4,1579660027.0,"Ask your vet for a referral to a rehab specialist to learn about the core body exercises you can do with him to strengthen the muscles that support his skeleton.  It can keep him mobile and pain free longer.  You'll also want to keep him at a good, even slightly under weight to keep stress off the joints.  And, in time, use appropriate pain medication, on the recommendation for your vet.  Depending on the severity, dogs can live pretty well and healthy lives even with mild to moderate HD."

dogs,ff71o3s,t3_es06dj,1579639352.0,"First stop is your vet.  He/she can recommend both supplements and let you know whether it's time to consider pain medication.  When my last boy got old, it made a world of difference.

Next, keep her at a good weight - even a little underweight.  Confirm with your vet at that appointment whether she is good or needs to lose a few pounds.

You can also ask about a referral to a rehab specialist to learn what exercises you can do to improve her core muscle strength.  Those muscle support her spine and joints and will keep her mobile and painfree longer."

Dogtraining,ff6yl8f,t3_erzkx3,1579637553.0,"Is she having fun or is she anxious?  How you might approach it depends on the motivation behind the destruction.  For anxiety-related behavior, I recommend visiting Malena DeMartini's site to learn how you can help.  If it is boredom and destruction is just fun for her, you need to find her better things to do.  I will say, that my dog enjoys ripping apart cardboard boxes.  I make him puzzle boxes (sealed boxes inside of more boxes, with treats salted between boxes) and let him destroy those.  YMMV, but it hasn't led to him being otherwise destructive."
