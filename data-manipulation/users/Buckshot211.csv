AskReddit,ffd0y9w,t3_esqt9g,1579811258.0,"I am envisioning this coming Saturday. I'm having to put my best friend down. Hes only 1 1/2 year old pup and is deaf. I love him more than anything. I'm going to be crushed. Luckily there's a service that will come to our home, so we don't have to take him anywhere. Its so hard to even think about whats going to happen"

FindingFennsGold,fes04aj,t3_eqgdpu,1579360111.0,I wish it was in Estes. I’m 45 minutes from there but I don’t have anything steering me that direction.
aww,fek8a24,t1_fehmsh6,1579194684.0,It’s great! I have a spot to hide in the apocalypse now!
videos,fehi8fj,t3_ep4wku,1579117071.0,This guy fucks
aww,fehgs2n,t1_fehgd2m,1579116219.0,Everything they talked about publicly were the main issues. The contract was terminated for convenience which means DIA has to pay the contractors for all the expenses leading up to the termination. DIA is a tough place to build and there were a lot of design and process changes that bogged everything down
aww,fehg6ho,t1_feh2f4g,1579115869.0,I was heavily involved in the original contract (part of the contractor group that got terminated). My guess is 2030 you’ll see it complete haha

ww3,fdkosjq,t3_ekvkrc,1578508024.0,Do you think the plane that went down was shot down by the military?
ww3,fdiox9m,t3_ekvkrc,1578447759.0,So new escalation. Are you hearing anything there? (Clearly don’t answer if any of this could get you killed or something). I haven’t heard anything from the US if we plan to follow up with a strike back. I have to assume whatever base sent the rockets will likely be hit sooner than tomorrow.
changemyview,fddxnne,t3_ekvhqn,1578326477.0,It seems most of the way we’re fighting wars these days is via drone/air strikes. I don’t foresee a flood of infantry hitting the ground that would require a draft. Our military is quite large as it is. Just my assumption
ww3,fddvuyp,t3_ekvkrc,1578325246.0,"Do you live in Iran currently, or just from Iran?"
microgrowery,fcv5pkf,t3_ej32m0,1577995186.0,You might have height problems in the future too
tifu,f7l9qgi,t3_dwmuat,1573835793.0,"I have an 11 month old deaf dog. I’ve always been against shock collars, but am now a huge advocate for it. We use it more as pressure release and for recall. Vibrating to tell him he’s doing good, and a continuous 1 as “pressure” similar to a leash. It doesn’t have to be a painful thing. Don’t let it come between you two. Research it and you can use it without hurting your dog"
