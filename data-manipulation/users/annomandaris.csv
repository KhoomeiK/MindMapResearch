Its also why they kind of jab and test each other out at the beginning,  you get a ""feel"" for his reach.  Then later you have to account for his reach, and how far hes leaning forward, etc.   Its all these variables that take years to get to this level of skill.

If you notice McGregors right hand hes holding it out like a feeler,  he knows when his arm is bent a certain way, and its out a certain angle, how far his knuckles are, so it lets him not have to look down at the body to tell when a punch is comming,  He knows when the guys chest hits his knuckles that it 1/4 of a second he will be in punching range, this lets him time his counter, a split second early and he leans into the punch, a split second later and he misses the opportunity."
sports,fffbyop,t1_fff9u16,1579880601.0,"Its all about energy transfer,  if both objects were perfectly hard with no deformation, then the transfer should be almost instantaneous, think billiard balls.

But when dealing with deformation, the first energy transferred deforms the objects, pushing them away so no further energy can be transferred. This means you have to ""push"" them for a fraction of a second.

As an educated guess for a punch it probably takes around 1/20th of a second to fully accelerate the head,  so your hand needs to travel for about 1/20th of a second longer after it makes contact, and that equates to around 1"" extra you need to aim for. 

For a hockey hit, there if more momentum/force, but there is also more mass to accelerate, and there is more deformation, because the entire body is moving, so you need more time to transfer the energy, and so you aim 1' behind the target."

If you had sex with a woman, and the father didn't consent, it was considered rape since a girl couldn't give consent (she was the property of her father).  Since you've now ""ruined"" the girl, and no ""good man"" would want to have her, you had to pay her father, and then marry her, otherwise she would eventually have no one to support her, and would either die homeless or have to become a prostitute.

Sazed already calls himself Harmony.  He wont lose himself per WoB because he already fit the two shards really well.
