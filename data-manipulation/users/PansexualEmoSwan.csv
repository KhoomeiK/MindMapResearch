todayilearned,fglod9c,t1_fglnkxd,1580906282.0,"Why not? You instantly jump to Max level or close to it (depending on how powerful your enchanted piece with ""fortify smithing"" was) and then just take that weapon or piece of armor to a grindstone or workbench and that should be all you need. You get to max level on smithing, and you gain all the levels and perk points that would be associated with leveling up a skill that much. All the skills will be available for you to unlock just as if you had taken the time to create a bunch of normal blacksmithing items.

Blacksmithing and alchemy both give xp based on the value of the finished product, and a sword that does a stupid amount of damage will have a stupid high value. Just make sure that you don't go *too* high when making the initial potions because you can exceed the parameters of the algorithm and ""break"" your game, forcing you to revert to a previous game save.

Survival,fg5qcb5,t3_ex09s9,1580535079.0,"I'm going to guess that you aren't in an area with a lot of paper birch because you would probably already know that birch bark is the best firestarter. What you need is [fatwood](https://youtu.be/FmQA-ChX4PQ)

If it's pouring down rain, get a few evergreen boughs to give you a dryer place to work, if possible. Fatwood is ideal because all the pine resin is concentrated in a small area and it's loaded with highly combustible VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). You also want a lot of surface area on your kindling and tinder. In fact, until you have a good bed of coals, nothing bigger than your wrist.

Always bear in mind the 3 things a fire needs are fuel, heat and oxygen. This is basic stuff but those factors become much more crucial and there becomes much less tolerance when everything is wet. So you will need to build it up enough so that there is a bit of a cubby where heat can build up, but there is also the ability to allow good airflow as the flame gets bigger.

Like the video shows, you want feather thin shavings and a lot of them, and preferably loaded with pine resin like the fatwood shavings in that video. These shavings that are very combustible and burn quickly will generate enough heat to start burning slightly bigger tinder like small twigs.

Have all this stuff gathered before you try to light the fire and remember that the worse the conditions, the more gradually you will need to build the fire up. This means you can't only have three sizes of wood, you will need a very gradual build up and a lot of the small stuff.

Take the time to gather everything you need, set up an adequate shelter if necessary to keep it as dry as possible, and build your fire right and you can be successful in even the worst conditions."

TwoXChromosomes,ffqwapo,t1_ffqnnds,1580145096.0,"As a man, I endorse this comment the most. My wife and I have actually some pretty great banter but I habitually take things too far. It is not your job to just accept behavior that you don't appreciate. It's your job to be clear on where the line is, so that he can either respect that or not. Then it becomes your job to decide what to do if he does not respect your wishes. 

Never settle for less than you feel you deserve, and always treat yourself the same way that you'd treat somebody that you love and respect.

You may not actually be compatible with this person in the long term, or perhaps he has some growing to do first that you aren't equipped to help him with. That's ok and sometimes it's a part of life.

*******

Now I will put down my lifecoaching hat and address your actual question, even though it is the most toxic option: The best way is to create fake social media accounts that are unable to be traced back to you, and join Facebook groups or websites that feature banter and toxic behavior such as ""flaming.""

The basic lesson to learn from these groups is that trolls are all looking for an emotional reaction, and if you give it to them, then they win and you lose. If you remove their ability to affect you emotionally then you take them out of the game. 

Mommy groups are the worst place for this, btw, because they seem to follow a trend of being reactionary and very emotional. Not a good example to follow if you're looking to thicken your skin and improve your ability to enjoy banter. MBTI groups on Facebook may be a good place to start, then when you get a feel for the way things work, you can ask to be added to secret groups where things get wild.

Again: I'm not suggesting this is a good thing for you to do, I'm just suggesting that it is probably the most effective way to thicken your skin. I've watched a lot of people change over the years in this manner, but not all changes have been for the better. 

So perhaps ask yourself if this is something that you're doing for yourself, or something that you're doing for somebody who may not respect your feelings enough to change his behavior. Good luck, friend!"
