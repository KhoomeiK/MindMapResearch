Holy shit - this sentence right here neatly packages contemporary problems.

Compared to previous eras in human history, we could have a literal Utopia using all that we have were it not for exploitation of others it took to get here and the exploitation it takes of others to maintain it.

I'm persistently reminded of Governor Nix's monologue in ""Tomorrowland"" -   


 ""Let's imagine... if you glimpsed the future, you were frightened by what you saw, what would you do with that information? You would go to the politicians, captains of industry? And how would you convince them? Data? Facts? Good luck! The only facts they won't challenge are the ones that keep the wheels greased and the dollars rolling in.  

...

 Meanwhile your earth was crumbling all around you. You've got simultaneous epidemics of obesity and starvation. Explain that one!""

&#x200B;

I read somewhere that in the US alone, we create enough food to provide every man, woman, and child something like 4300 calories per day ... the typical human only needs - what?- 2,000 per day?

We don't provide those calories to everyone because ... well, capitalism ... profits and shareholder-happiness are more important than human life.

The healthcare system in the US is a literal your-money-or-your-life machine -- and the money-holders in the goddamned UK are envious of it!

Food security, affordable access to healthcare and mental healthcare, affordable access to housing, education, equitable access to infrastructure/transportation, and prioritizing environmental protection - the institution of Capitalism has no moral obligation to provide any of these because in every one of these, there's immense wealth to be extracted.

I forgot where I was going with this and my thoughts have devolved into a confusing rant.

So, sorry about this ... I'm 51 years old and became 

\- disillusioned about what I thought was reality during the Clinton Administration 

\- pissed off and ashamed during the Bush II era 

\- hopeful and then betrayed during the Obama Administration

\- brokenhearted when Bernie Sanders lost the Democratic nomination, and now

\- horrified and enraged during this monumental clusterfuck of an administration.

I realize my privilege has kept me blind to the litany of shit my country and economy has done in my name to keep me fed yet ""sedated"" by distractions ... but, not any more.

Again, I forgot where I was going with this, but writing this out has been cathartic - it's also helped me focus on the bigger picture:  I still have a lot to learn.

Thanks to this sub for existing - I'm learning a lot from your posts."
