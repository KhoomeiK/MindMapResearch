cats,ffe09ll,t3_et3kws,1579833367.0,"What you're missing: Those foods are overpriced for what they are. (Kitty McDs)

The sites and books I've read always made my math for wet food add up to *roughly* 1 oz per pound of cat every day. So a 9 pound cat would get 9 oz or more a day. It really depends on the food, it's quality, your cat's activity level, how overweight or lean they are, etc. 

Buying straight up 5oz cans of a good quality wet cat food ends up being cheaper than the ""snack"" foods you mentioned."
CatAdvice,fepexdr,t3_eqb536,1579318801.0,"Its still kneading, its just kneading on volume 10. Mine tend to do that when they're still wound up or not ready for me to go to bed and its a bit of an anxious gesture. If I play them out before sleep they're more relaxed at bedtime."
cats,fep47mq,t1_feotjvc,1579311764.0,"Only if you intend to leave it behind. If you take it with you and have committed to that 20 year timeline, I see no hypocrisy."
cyberpunkgame,femftkn,t1_fellwwz,1579253273.0,I highly doubt that. They'd have to refund all the pre-orders/sales for ps4 and xbox one. Basically every console copy they have sold. Not happening.
cats,felf1v6,t1_fejwtfn,1579220652.0,"That's fair and in a way I agree. I don't think we should just lock them in and leave it at that. I'm one of the people who believes in changing the home to accomidate the animals you have. So desogning your home layout in such a way that they have plenty of places to climb, jump and be a bit wild. Toys, playtime, etc. Without all that, I do think cats can become a bit unfulfilled. So, I do get what you mean. 

You have a good day to. :)"
cats,fejr436,t3_epjmdh,1579183749.0,"I normally tell them I'm going to hunt for their food. (In a round about way, we are.) Not sure if they get it, but it makes *me* feel less guilty."
cats,fejpsh5,t1_fejnubd,1579182722.0,":D Yeah, I guess we just get used to it. I grew up being told not to get close to the canals because of the gators and my Mother worked in wildlife rehab. So, I got used to all the animals and actually seeing them around where most overlook them. But it still catches me off guard at times. 

I Ex: I work night shift and went out for lunch break. On my way back I saw a ""dog"" as I was stopping at a stop sign. Thinking it was lost, I went to get out of the car. Then stopped dead with my hand on the handle as I glanced as him again. The look on its face made that instinctual voice in my head go, ""Not. A. Dog."" I locked the door for some idiot reason and continued on my way to work, where my coworkers told me local dogs had been breeding with cyotes. Yeeeah. That was a fun surprise. XD

So, yeah. Lots here to harm the furkids. Stuff like the vid is a real thing here and unfortunately common. :(

Sorry if I was brash. Its a tender spot for me with how many people seem to be ambivalent to their animal's saftey."
cats,fejlu66,t1_fejkkox,1579179260.0,"I tend to go big picture like that. Its a bad habit.

You seriously have zero animals that could hurt your cat in your area? I'm trying to wrap my head around that concept but it just doesn't want to compute. Like I want ask where your at for that to be possible but I also don't want you to feel pressured to overshare. I just can't imagine not having birds of prey or something. Tjen again, I guess humans could be dangerous enough. Plenty of people who hurt other animals out there."
cats,fejk2zd,t1_fejjw3s,1579177502.0,"Not really surprised, no. I just find it hard to believe that any of our 6 habitable continants have totally eradicated all animals that could harm cats. If that is actually true, I find that sad beyond compare. That continant/country would be ecologically dead and that's even more horrible to me."
cats,fejjohr,t1_fejjfuk,1579177072.0,"You don't have any racoons, possums, birds of prey, or any other medium sized wild animal that can hurt your cat in your area? Even when I lived in Ft. Lauderdale Fl, a metropolitan city, there were still many animals that could kill or injure cats.  I'll be very surprised if you live somewhere that there are zero wild animals. Just because you don't notice them, doesn't mean they aren't there."
cats,fejjd5i,t1_fejizsv,1579176727.0,"I don't think it's scaremongering. It's reality. There are predators that will try to eat your cat. That's just a fact of the outdoors. Most people just don't think about how scary that must be for their cat. 

And no. Nothing is guaranteed. Any of us could die tomorrow from something stupid and boring. But there are increased chances and odds that you can put in your favor or against your favor. 

And you had a lucky cat. I've had lucky cats who were indoor/outdoor as well. Doesn't change the fact that the odds were against them. They were the fortunate ones. 

And you can think comparing children to cats is nonsense. Most people have that opinion. I disagree but then again, I don't think our species is anything special. So, that's probably the difference."
cats,fejiuee,t1_fejiprx,1579176139.0,"Of course it does. This, and the other dangers outdoors, is *why* their life expectancy is less. You disregarded the dangers by saying that it was like trying to keep kids inside. All the same topic."
cats,fejilh0,t1_fejic9u,1579175848.0,Nice downvote. Your answer is 10 years or less for outdoor cats. 20 years for indoor cats.
cats,fejic9u,t1_feji4rw,1579175540.0,"Yep. I see no difference between the two. Its one of the reasons I don't like most humans. They think they're better than other animals. But that's besides the point. 

A cat has the mental capacity of a 2-4 year old human depending on the breed and intelligence of that cat. So, yeah, you're sending a 3 year old outside and expecting it to be fine because it has sharp fingernails and teeth. 

Pop quiz, what is the life expectancy of a cat?"
cats,feji16p,t1_feji07x,1579175160.0,How so?
cats,fejhxiz,t1_fejhpsr,1579175035.0,Do you let your 3 year old go outside without supervision? Same thing.
cats,fejhfh2,t3_epgwr6,1579174389.0,"Yes, I've had my cats do this, and the related act of  ""burying"" their food, often. You may also see them scatch at the floor after eating or cover their leftovers with objects. It's all the same instinctive act. In the wild cats bring food back to their den/nest to eat and bury their food to cover the scent. Your water dish is the closest thing she has to represent a ""den"" in her territory (your home). Hence her dropping it in or near the water bowl.

She's re-enacting her insinct to hunt for the prey, kill it and take it to her den."
CatAdvice,fejgivm,t3_eph4ay,1579173172.0,"1) You found a treat she likes. Offer it to her everytime you visit with her and sit quietly with her while she eats it. Also sit with her while she eats regular meals, even if you have to sit on the other side of the room before she's comfortable enough to eat.

2) Play with her. 

Get a wand/fishing toy with feathers or a fuzzy mouse and tempt her to play. (Remember to make it act like the animal you are mimicing. Be prey.) Get her to play as much as you can. She may seem hesitant and indecisive, darting out to play for a few seconds and then running back to ""safety"". That's normal. Just keep at it and, again, be quiet. Not silent but quiet. If you talk use a ""library voice"" thats calm, low volume and relaxing. 

3) Also, keep your movements mild. No quick sudden movements. Just deliberate, calm and relaxed movement. She will pick up on you being calm and relaxed, and reflect it back at you. 

4) Don't reprimand her for ANYTHING right now. Even if she scratches or bites, take it with a blank relaxed face ""feel better now?"" attitude. (You can correct her behavior later. I'm just talking about now, while you win her over.) 

5) Don't reach for her. Just sit in the room and let her come to you. Don't reach out to pet her. Let her touch you first. If she seems interested, slowly offer her hand to smell and, without rushing it, see if you can scratch her chin and cheeks. After that she might start rubbing on you to signal she wants to be scratched and petted. 

6) Always leave her on a good note. If you mess up, you'll want to run. Don't. Move away, sit and wait. When she relaxes, put down a treat. Let her eat it and *then* leave. 

You haven't messed up your kitten. She's not a human and they are much more forgiving than we are. All it means is that you'll need to invest some extra time in her and show her you just want to love her. :)

Ps; I'd say keep her in the bedrrom if she's still there. It gives her the opportunity to observe you in your quietest and calmest moments. It is also the most vulnerable act you can do with any animal (sleeping around them) and that won't be lost on her. To her that's a huge amount of trust you are showing her and it will encourage her to show you trust in return. You might even wake up at some point to find her cuddled by your side."
cats,feg79c0,t3_eozlax,1579080327.0,"Is this a trick question? 

Everything about them. They each have a unique personality. They are very caring and empathetic, contrary to popular belief. They are highly trainable. They are fun to play with. They make the best sounds; trills, meows, chirps and (of course) purrs. They're curious and like to be involved. They are social without being too demanding. They walk that fine line of being independent yet still making you feel wanted and needed. 

What's *not* to like?"
cats,feg6vlx,t3_eozq6g,1579079790.0,"She may have been dumped. Declawed cats are known to have issues using the litterbox and bitting *because* they are declawed. First the human creates the problem by cutting up thier paws. Then they throw the cat out because it has issues from what the human did. Worse is when they go out and get another kitten to do it all over again. It drives me crazy! 

Glad she found a home that will understand her!"
cats,fefiaxu,t3_eovxlm,1579056906.0,"A slow intro would be the best way. It takes a week or two but they're normally good after that. 

This video should help:
https://youtu.be/tsYT7yIOdqQ

Just make sure they both eat when you feed them. If they seem hesitant, move the plates further from the door until they're comfortable eating. Swapping out cat scratchers between the new one's room and the rest of the house helps too."
cats,fed3nk8,t3_eoh8qn,1578997189.0,"What makes *us* so different from each other. Environment, how we've reacted to experiences, genetics, the state if our health...

It's no different for cats. Your older brothers have lived for quite a while in a good, safe and happy home. Plus, if they're biological brothers, they've never been totally alone. Add to that, if you got them as kittens, they may not have ever really been in a really rough spot or were too young to remember it. Kids who have it good seldom appreciate *how* *good* they have it.  

Your new kitty was recently a stray; living on the streets, struggling to find food, struggling to find a place to sleep, struggling to not get killed by predators, struggling to stay alive AND she was doing it all alone. You came along and saved her from that, gave her food, a safe place to sleep in comfort and love. Of course she's going to be greatful. In fact, she might even be afraid of loosing it all again since her being a stray (rather than feral) says she's lived with humans before. If she was abandoned, the clinginess is almost expected. You saved her, she knows it... and she's hoping she doesn't loose it again."
cats,fe4tedw,t3_ensm5t,1578862631.0,"She looks like a standard domestic tabby. IOW a general mix which is what you'll generally have unless you buy from a cetified breeder or find a specialty breed abandoned at the shelter because the owner didn't know what they were getting into. 

If that feels too bland, think about this...

Standard domestics are like Kinder eggs. Because you don't know all the breeds that are in their genetics, you'll always have fun discovering their unique personalities!"
CatAdvice,fe4ojpw,t1_fe3oawq,1578861394.0,"Then next step would be a vet visit if you haven't already. Not sure why it would only be at night but it could be a medical issue. If it hurts when she deficates, she'll start associating the box with pain and avoid going in it. Going *right* outside it tends to show they know they should go there but something (pain, hard to get into, they feel unsafe, ect) is preventing them from actually doing so. 

You might also try a litterbox with lower sides and no hood if you don't have one like that already."
cats,fe3ono2,t3_enq44p,1578851399.0,"I'd say pretty normal. Given her age and the fact she just got rehomed, I think she's just scared and getting used to the place. You could try buying cave beds (the plush beds with roofs they can hide in) to place around the house. Those might encourage her to explore more. Treats and love will go a long way."
CatAdvice,fe3njny,t3_enqe6i,1578851032.0,"I can think of two possible reasons off the top of my head that aren't medical. 

1. She is getting ambushed by the other cats at night, when you aren't awake to keep the peace. I think its a less likely option, but possible. Adding extra litter boxes to the house might help this. (You should have 1 per cat plus an extra)

2. There's something that comes around at night (strays, possum, raccoon, etc) that freaks her out and she's doing it to territorially mark/protect the house. Is there a window close to the spot she has accidents? If so, maybe put a sight blocker outside the window, or set up spray can deterrents to see if they help."
cats,fe3hgiq,t3_enph05,1578849310.0,"Well, it is a kitten. If it were a human, it would be somewhere between a 4 to 6 years old child. It just left it's Mom, siblings and the only home it has ever known. Its probably lonely and a bit scared. 

3 solutions: 

1. Go back and adopt another kitten, preferably a sibling. They will keep each other company, give them a companion when you're gone and give them a cuddle buddy when they sleep.

2. Don't get up at night. Human children do the same thing. ""I need the bathroom."" ""I need some water."" Etc. Any parent will tell you at some point you just start ignoring their attempts to stay awake and go to sleep. By getting up, you just reinforce the behavior and make it harder for kitty to break the habits. 

3. Make sure they have plenty of toys that they can play with by themselves. Motion or sound sctivated toys are great for this."
CatAdvice,fdy6ha0,t3_en63kz,1578776558.0,Use a fishing toy and play with him until you wear him out.
cats,fdsviil,t3_en0xre,1578708482.0,"I've made common toys like fishing wands, milk caps with stuff added to them, catnip satchels/pouches, etc. I'm in the process of redoing my apartment to be even more cat friendly and plan to try out some ideas I've found. One is a puzzle feeder that looks simple to make but challenging for the babies. 

Basically you take a board and glue dowel rods onto it in patterns so it makes it a challenge to pull the treats out. Another one is paper towel or toilet paper rolls cut to different sizes and glued to a board so they have to fish the treats out. 

The cool thing about the cheaper diy toy is if it comes out good and they really like it you can always make it again out of durable materials. Or, if they totally ignore it you have no problem just throwing it out. 

Like someone else pointed out, sometimes simple is better."
cats,fdssvwn,t3_en0u3t,1578707513.0,Yeeeah... call me crazy but I'd be looking for a second opinion/possibly a new vet.
cats,fdssa62,t3_en0vmn,1578707291.0,Aww. Poor thing. Did she happen to leave any dirty laundry behind or maybe a heavily used blanket? Just having something with her scent might help him cope till she gets home.
