Midsommar,fcgia7m,t1_fcg7t3u,1577640285.0,I think a lot of people took away that it was about the deterioration of the couple’s relationship. I’ve heard it said that it’s an allegory for the cruelty of nature. You’ll find it’s hard to stop trying to figure it out. I saw it in August and am still trying to figure it out.

I was talking about it with my dad and he said something along the lines of Ari being deeper than most horror movies. And I see what you mean about feeling like you’re there when you watch it. I’ve actually had several nightmares that I’m there!"

Midsommar,fccseod,t3_eh2sfu,1577602079.0,"Keep in mind, the group was constantly doing drugs. If you’ve ever been high before, you know how blurred lines become. Even an anthropology student can do something remarkably dumb if they’re constantly on drugs. Also keep in mind, Christian and Josh did some pretty dumb shit too. Being an anthropology student doesn’t exactly mean you’re the brightest bulb on the tanning bed."
