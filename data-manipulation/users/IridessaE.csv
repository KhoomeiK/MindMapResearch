ScottPetersonCase,ffpar8z,t1_ffp4qu7,1580090395.0,What do you say about the recorded phone call between an inmate and his brother talking about how the brothers friend (who committed said burglary) said laci saw him robbing that house? And what do you say about the MULTIPLE neighbors who saw laci that morning?
ScottPetersonCase,ffp9r16,t1_ffp5l56,1580089693.0,"But I’m not just talking about one or two women. I’m talking about 5 and maybe more women who were all 7-9 months pregnant and went missing 
+/- 5 years before or after laci went missing. And what about the woman who was also eight months pregnant just a few blocks down from laci who was being stalked by three men and only escaped because she was able to lock herself in the small shop that she owned. I’m not saying there was a serial killer. I’m not even saying that all of these women were connected. I’m just saying that there is no irrefutable evidence that he did it."
ScottPetersonCase,ffnjvoe,t1_ffnjgf5,1580066927.0,"Sure, but he made plenty of money and they were in no way financially strained. Also, after she disappeared/was found he never called or visited the office to Claim that life insurance policy."
ScottPetersonCase,ffnjfjb,t1_ffnit8e,1580066737.0,"Besides the fact that I would call that part of satanic panic, there was no proof of that. No records of phone calls or back and forth. No deleted searches from his computer. And what are the chances of him meeting some people in a bar and them telling Scott they were cultists? Killers? Or him approaching a stranger and what, saying he wanted his wife killed and did they know anyone who could help?"
ScottPetersonCase,ffnhvpm,t1_ffnh8qf,1580066172.0,How do you account for the other missing women? (I just edited this post to include that)
UnresolvedMysteries,ffnhpvi,t1_ffnhivj,1580066126.0,"I thought the same thing! If you like podcasts,  check Crime Junkie! It’s the second and third episode."
ScottPetersonCase,ffnfezk,t1_ffnf6aq,1580065292.0,"My response to this question will take an entire book to cover, but the evidence is there. What makes you think he’s guilty?"
UnresolvedMysteries,ffna4ci,t1_ffn9xoo,1580063553.0,Yes! I’m actually writing a book on this!
UnresolvedMysteries,ffmxdew,t3_eu2jcw,1580059866.0,"I supposed it isn’t unresolved in the public’s eye, but I don’t think Scott Peterson killed his wife and unborn son, Laci and Connor Peterson."

AskReddit,ff7qma2,t1_ff7qjkk,1579655977.0,I mean I don’t have a unit but it’s a good joke
