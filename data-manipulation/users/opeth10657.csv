Yeah, that massive 3.7 ypc from Howard last season was such a huge difference from that 3.7 ypc from Monty this year.  The best part is that Trubisky was one of the reasons the Bears running game wasn't complete shit last year.

Probably because the 49ers had an actual running game to pull in coverage.  Along with one of the best TEs in the game and some burner WRs.  Bears had practice squad TEs and their only speedy WR missed most of the season.
