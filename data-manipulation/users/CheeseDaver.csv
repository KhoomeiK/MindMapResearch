tmbg,ffsbjw4,t3_euajl0,1580177804.0,The bonus content is the best part.
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ffqn4jt,t1_ffqfw2b,1580138974.0,Both fascism and communism were two competing forms of right wing governance because both have highly consolidated power. Left wing government has less consolidated power.

BlackClover,ffi2tcx,t3_etgox4,1579963430.0,You would miss the Black Bulls getting coked up on Charmy’s mana replenishing food so that Henry can pilot the mecha house to the elf base. It’s the best part. The chemistry between everyone goes into hyperdrive.
BlackClover,ffe5dlj,t3_et0dem,1579837135.0,I started watching it a month ago and just got caught up at the perfect time with this weeks episode. I love how grounded the storytelling is while having the right amount of shonen conventions.
nottheonion,ffdnqro,t1_ffdaskm,1579824787.0,"So what if someone raises their voice. Raising your voice doesn't hurt anyone. It doesn't mean they are going to get violent. If someone is raising their voice, it is because they are hurt. The sound of a crying black person is more likely to be perceived as a threat than a crying white person. Calling the cops on someone raising their voice or crying is victim blaming plain and simple."
nottheonion,ffcz6mc,t1_ffcvqza,1579810278.0,Still not an excuse to call the cops. Call them after the investigation. He could have been assaulted or killed.

If it was mostly bad checks, is there a way to confirm if they forged those check themselves or if they themselves were scammed by people who they thought paid them legitimate checks and were therefore set up? Shouldn’t the issuers of the checks be held liable instead of the recipients?"

I don’t know why some people say there is no way. The higher gen mons are found in higher level islands, so they are found in in evolutions respective of their levels."

LateStageCapitalism,ffao802,t1_ffaf6fc,1579740585.0,"Absolutely not. I already acknowledged that, but said we can change them as well. Did you not read the what I wrote? “Ideally, if we make system changes on the conduct of big businesses, we are going to make changes on the conduct of small businesses as well.”"
LateStageCapitalism,ffaefzi,t1_ffabfi8,1579733718.0,"Yes, I know that."
LateStageCapitalism,ffab49s,t1_ff9yr3f,1579731436.0,"That’s awfully pessimistic and not looking for any solution. Ideally, if we make system changes on the conduct of big businesses, we are going to make changes on the conduct of small businesses as well."
antiwork,ff7td1o,t3_es4vxt,1579657883.0,The only message I get from all that is to seize the means of production. They must have thought they were being cute. Great time to hold them to that philosophy.
LateStageCapitalism,ff7na36,t3_es3zkm,1579653628.0,It’s the existence of this bullshit that keeps me crippled with anxiety.
