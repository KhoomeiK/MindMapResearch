dogs,fg8epip,t3_ex95th,1580617303.0,"After not having a dog for around 6 years...I pretty much sought out my foster fail pup. At the time I worked at a dog daycare that also boarded dogs for the owner's daughter's rescue. My boy was so shut down and really came out of his shell after a couple weeks with me. When the rescue started finally getting apps for him, I had to shut that down quick because I already knew he was mine."
Dogtraining,ffvoin8,t1_fftqlqd,1580269005.0,"I got a teaching degree at 24 and while it was great...I still just wasn't fulfilled. Ended up making a sudden move to another state at 26 where I just had to find a job as quickly as possible and worked in a kennel for a while. I loved working with animals so I pursued another job working with the humane society. Now I work as a one person department there coordinating transports up North and working with rescues. It's a lot of work, but for the first time ever I truly enjoy my job. I get the chance to work with dog behavior every day and send dogs in need on to better places to help with overcrowding in the shelter. Sorry for the rambling but I'm 30 now and it's the best feeling to know that I'm in a position that makes a difference for animals. Overall I feel like it's made me a happier person."
ThriftStoreHauls,ffpidrj,t1_ffpdg0t,1580095772.0,What an awesome find! I would have snapped this up instantly.
DontFundMe,ffpg8u3,t1_ffpas6l,1580094290.0,"I had a former coworker that was kind of like this. She still has so many dogs and never enough money to go around. On top of that, none are altered so at least 2-3 times a year there's an 'oops' litter..."
My600lbLife,ffjxcva,t1_ffe05sv,1580009547.0,I worry about any dog in this kind of situation...like there's no way they're getting regular walks and other things dogs need to be content :(
My600lbLife,ffjt9mi,t1_ffioyw2,1580006334.0,"Have you ever tried cauliflower crust pizza? It can be a bit of a hassle to make, but it tasted just about the same as regular pizza to me. Highly recommend!"
lookatmydog,ffjq6xd,t3_ety8g6,1580004156.0,After working for a bit in a doggie daycare setting...I have come to the conclusion most Aussies are either a Sydney or a Tucker. Cute dog!
AnimalShelterStories,ff83n2w,t1_ff80el1,1579665112.0,I'm glad you were there for him! We just had a GSD returned for being 'too docile' and not playing with the other dog in their home on the first day. Sometimes people don't even try :(
AnimalShelterStories,ff7xrw4,t1_ff7n9vk,1579660885.0,I was discussing this earlier today with a coworker. So many people don't understand what constitutes aggression. Much of what they're defining as aggression is either typical dog/puppy behaviors or a reaction to something the new owner is doing that they don't understand their new pet's perception of.
badroommates,ff7w4py,t1_ff7o6t6,1579659770.0,Agh my last roommate always bought so much freezer/fridge stuff that I had no room to store anything for myself. I feel your pain.
Embroidery,ff4u7zg,t3_erioch,1579572560.0,Love this! The black hoop frames it so nicely.
ThriftStoreHauls,ff1twkq,t3_er22hy,1579486091.0,I love my faux fur coat. I only wish mine was this long! Looks super warm.
Dogtraining,feov4c7,t1_feocqui,1579306085.0,"Right! I'm hoping my dog will potentially make a good candidate to eventually be able to visit hospitals and nursing homes to comfort people. He's over two now and were starting his training in April. He was a calm puppy, but I still wanted him to be more mature before we give this a shot."
humblebrag,feloh2p,t1_feleuxs,1579227071.0,I think she looks like a pleasant early 30's...I just turned 30 this year and I would assume she's my age or a couple of years older but idk lol
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feliix1,t1_fel7fdi,1579222996.0,I've seen a dog with a similar facial structure to this one before but he was a hound mix. It seems like some sort of mild facial deformity but I can't for the life of me remember what it's called.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,felf5n8,t1_fel0tw6,1579220722.0,"Very true! I work with rescues daily as part of my job, and there's a lot of strange ones but luckily just as many amazing ones."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fefopdw,t3_eoo7aq,1579061020.0,"I hope you send the rescue and humane society updates! This is my job title at my work, and I love getting pictures of their awesome new lives. It's really uplifting for those of us 'in the trenches' of animal rescue."
dogs,feci09n,t1_fec4d3y,1578974388.0,"This is so true. My dog is very laid back, but he only tolerates very calm children. The ones that run up screaming 'doggy, doggy' with their arms waving wildly scare the crap out of him and he (and dogs like him) would be set up for failure in a setting with kids that aren't very dog savvy."
dogs,fecho79,t1_febmbtb,1578974158.0,"Oh lord, so sorry you had to know someone with such a lack of compassion for animals.

I can't imagine being angered at the sight of a dog...and I've worked with dogs for years and have had plenty of frustrating moments. I hate that people like this find ways to own a dog."
dogs,fec2h70,t1_fe9t29q,1578965699.0,Dogs in the bed is the best thing ever. I have trouble sleeping when I go out of town and don't have my 55 lb hound mix curled up where my legs should be.
ThriftStoreHauls,fdwehuy,t3_en202e,1578757876.0,I read that as 'booty shorts' and was confused because those shorts are a classy fit. Love the outfit and the colors!
dogs,fdw84ty,t1_fdvyqqd,1578756030.0,Are you thinking of sarcoptic mange? Demodex isn't contagious unless another pet in the home has a surpressed immune system.
dogs,fdw674f,t1_fdtmdjs,1578755438.0,"That's so sad. I don't understand how people can just abandon a dog.

I work at a shelter and spoke to a woman recently who was wanting to surrender her family's 8 year old dog...because they were having a second child and it was too much responsibility. Why do I feel like this same family will go out and get a new puppy within the next couple years?"
lookatmydog,fdp6w4r,t3_emfmkn,1578621399.0,"At least she's a happy drunk! Post dental, my dog stood at the top of a staircase rocking back and forth with narrowed eyes like 'you...ye...hey you...mfer!'"
CrossStitch,fdp42e5,t1_fdoppdb,1578619509.0,"Good thinking! I recently started my first project on black Aida and I left my phone lit up in my lap under it, but this sounds like less of a headache."
ThriftStoreHauls,fdm62y4,t3_em11l3,1578540692.0,I like the fit a lot! Good find.
dogs,fdixgte,t1_fdie9dp,1578453261.0,"I second the dremel! My dog seems to hate the pressure of clippers, but will sleep through a nail trim with the dremel."
AnimalShelterStories,fdcugev,t3_eko8eb,1578284640.0,"Aw man, I've been there. Trust me when I say that I know how difficult it can be. I was lucky to be able to take a position at my shelter where I am now responsible for transport and rescue. So far we've been able to keep our adoption center and animal control at very manageable levels. It's a ton of work but I'm always glad to send off 25+ dogs from the shelter each week."
