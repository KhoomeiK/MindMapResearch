GoldandBlack,ffbbmjd,t1_ffb1vdt,1579758685.0,"Ya I’ve explained the numbers to ppl before. Basically if you look at how much you pay in, if you were to invest that into your own retirement account you would end up getting more off interest alone from your savings in retirement than what social security will pay. That doesn’t even account for the fact that you have real money you’re making interest on too. And if you die before retiring, you never see any of that social security “you paid into”. On top, that’s all assuming there even is social security anymore when you retire.

Basically, ppl don’t like to look at the numbers. Numbers bite them so the government gets away with calling it a social program for the poor. Even though it is a tax on the poor, as the rich don’t have to pay into it after the first like 150k in income."

Seems like he’s one of the type I used to work with that doesn’t need ppl telling him what to do or how to do things. A lot coming from insecurity because they don’t want to be told/realize mistakes they’re doing.

Ultimately, he prolly just wants to be best friends with his kids rather than being a parent. I say that mostly because my my brother-in-law is with that with his kid. His kid was 5 when they got together and didn’t behave or listen to anyone. I would be sitting in the couch and he’d run full speed and jump into me both knees tucked trying to land on my balls. No shit, did it 3 times in a row right in front of his dad who says “hey, we don’t knee ppl in the balls”, then he does it agin and his dad just kinda laughs. Wtf?  My sister started trying to make rules and discipline and both the kid and the dad would get mad at her “that’s my son you’re yelling at”.

Before anyone says it, ya the dad is kinda worthless, but he’s not as bad of an overall person as it sounds. He simply wants to be his son’s best friend, and so his kid views him as a friend rather than a parent that he has to listen to. He more trys to provide what he would have loved as a kid (even as an adult he’s basically a kid).

Anyhow he fell behind in school because his dad didn’t make him do homework because that wasn’t fun. Ultimately, my sister and the dad have been together for 5 years, married 3 and the kid has made enormous strides because she finally laid out rules and punishments. He’s still well behind the curve in school (but only a grade behind now) and still doesn’t listen really well. But he listens a million times better than before, so it’s big progress.

Oh and yes. He is that dad at youth games. Every goal his kid scores “YAAAAAAA!!! HES THE STAR PLAYER!!” Every time I see the kid “dad says I’m the best player on the team” “dad says I’m the fastest in my grade”. That’s not the kid’s fault."
