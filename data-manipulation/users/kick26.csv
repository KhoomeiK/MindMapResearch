gifs,feer3sm,t3_eoqxgn,1579039420.0,"This has happened to me once with my parents propane grill. The tank was shooting flames from the a broken part of the hose just ahead of the regulator. It was against our house on our deck and in my mom’s panic, I grabbed two oven mitts and grabbed the grill and dragged it out away from the house towards the middle of the deck. It got kinda hot but I wasn’t burned even though i was right by the 3 foot long flame. Luckily, our siding was painted wood so it didn’t melt or catch fire. We called the fire department whom were only 2 miles up the road and they put it out with a fire extinguisher and the remove the tank which was now just spraying gas and tried to cool it down with the garden hose. Fun times"

They’d just fly away. Loons on the other hand were far more aggressive at protecting their nests and eggs.
