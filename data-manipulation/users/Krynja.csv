MaliciousCompliance,ff4g8en,t1_ff42i9q,1579562864.0,At the Pizza Hut I worked at years ago we couldn't start prepping the dough for the next day until the restaurant closed. Not because of any procedures but because we only had enough pans to hold one day's dough. So at the end of the day we had to burn off all of the one day old dough that hadn't been used.  (Which was a stupid procedure because the dough was perfectly fine for the next day and actually had more flavor) Then wash all the pans before we had enough pans to *start* prepping for the next day. We normally had to stay two to two and a half hours beyond our scheduled end time to do all the prep.

FoodPorn,fcmb32m,t1_fcm5ged,1577769229.0,"I watched Good eats and mainly used his recipe for good eats turkey, brine included. I used to make the turkey for the annual friendsgiving get together of, a bunch of my friends lol. Kind of worked myself into a job with that one. Made it one year and everyone said, yeah you're in charge making the turkey from now on. 

Did that for past 8 years and for the past 5, I smoked the turkey instead of using the oven because everyone else needed the oven. Did it with hickory for 2 years with the second year also having Jack Daniels chips. Then two years with oak (chips and chunks)which I really like. The last year I did it with applewood but then also threw in some cherry because one of the guys was going to do his smoked bologna and brought some cherry wood so I said fuck it toss it in. 

Didn't get to do it this year because the couple that we always had it at house got divorced earlier this year and everything kind of fell apart."
FoodPorn,fcma5dd,t1_fclpd9d,1577768418.0,I like the hickory flavor but I kind of fell in love with oak too because to me it adds kind of a subtle sweetness as well. Could be a good thing to mix in with the hickory so you get some kind of sweet hickory
Coffee,fclfi3b,t3_ehr5ed,1577746593.0,"There used to be a neat little animation that showed the whole process and made it easier to understand but I can't find it at the moment, so I'll just have to go off memory.

To make this simpler to picture let's just imagine that each bit of grounds is its own miniature bean. When the ""bean"" get wet, it begins giving off CO2. This outward pressure of CO2 escaping forms a ""shell"" around the bean. Think of it like deep frying something. The outgoing steam keeps the oil from getting into the food and making it greasy. *However* in this case we **want** the oil (water) to come into contact with the bean so it can pull flavors out.

 In immersion style like French presses and aeropress this is not an issue because the water is always around the grounds. When the beans run out of ""steam"" the water is still right there to come into contact with them. However in pour overs, each bit of water is only going to be in contact with the beans for a limited amount of time. If the beans are currently still outgassing a lot, the water can't really come into contact with the bean and extract much flavor before it has passed by that ""bean"" and lost its chance. 

This can lead to under extracted coffee. Or even sour tasting coffee because the water has absorbed a lot of the co2 without enough of the coffee flavor to balance it out. By wetting the coffee with a small amount of water beforehand and waiting you are venting some of that ""steam"" before the main amount of water starts its journey through the grounds.

 There will still be outgassing, but it won't be enough to keep the water away from the grounds and you actually **want** a bit of CO2 dissolved into the water to help balance the flavor of the coffee. This is also a reason to get freshly roasted beans instead of ones that have been sitting on a shelf for months. In addition to the normal problems of going stale / rancid / etc, these beans have lost a lot of their CO2. Which would seem like a good thing except they've lost so much that you're not going to get that proper amount dissolved into the water to help balance the coffee."

FoodPorn,fcl7du3,t3_eho0up,1577741408.0,"White meat on turkeys is done at 160°f while dark meat isn't considered done until 181°. That is why those little pop-up thermometers are the bane of all things turkey. They pop up at 181 which is when your dark meat would be done. But this means the white meat is 20° overcooked. And that's not even taking into account carryover heat which will bump each thing up about an additional 10°.

The trick is to slightly insulate the white meat so that by the time the dark meat hits 181 the white meat is hitting 160.  In an oven you would do this with a little tin foil folded into a triangle and made into a breastplate for the white meat along with a probe thermometer stuck into the white meat set to go off at 150 to 153. (Carry over heat as you let the turkey rest for 30 minutes or so after removing from the oven will take it on up to the final desired temperature.)

It's hard to do this though on a smoker because the tin foil would keep the smoke from penetrating the meat in that spot. So you break out your secret weapon: strips of thick cut bacon. Drape them over the white meat with about an inch of space between each strip. This insulates the white meat while still allowing smoke flavor to penetrate.
