The “evidence” for is:

-she was given a perfectly androgynous name (Jamie is one of the few names close to equally male and female), though her mother explained that in an interview as a friend suggesting she choose an androgynous name before birth so she’d only have to choose one name that would work either way

-she has very slender hips and men tend to have slimmer hips, though obviously many women have slim hips too

-she has some arguably masculine facial features

-she has been arguably stronger for her size than might be expected (as seen in many movies), though this could be attributed to working out her whole life, and other women such as Linda Hamilton are the same

-she never had any biological children, and hermaphrodites/intersex people who have surgery as a baby to become female usually cannot reproduce

-she doesnt talk about it and despite it being a rumour that has been surrounding her her entire life, she’s never discussed or denied it

It’s up to anyone to decide for themselves what they think, but it shouldn’t matter whether she is or isn’t. She’s just a person living her best life."

Sorry but I have a feeling if the sexes were reversed the entire thread would be chock full of ntas calling the husband uncaring, mean-spirited and probably advising her to leave him if he would do that to his one-armed wife constantly and making her wait outside the house where she could be robbed, raped or murdered.

To me this being the top voted comment is just another example of the sub's bias against men. If it were a woman without an arm, and her husband was leaving the door locked where she couldn't open it, oh you better believe almost all the responses would be nta and calling the husband a huge asshole for not accommodating her and not worrying enough about her and leaving her outside where she could be murdered or raped until he got home."

AmItheAsshole,fgj8qoe,t1_fgj7fla,1580839200.0,"Em, that's your judgment from our particular western countries standards. But I already said it might not have been fair, just that they weren't left destitute.

To me this is sounding like a country where men technically own any business, which is why the father was able to ""take"" the company away from the mom when he left her. So technically, legally what he did in that country was probably legit and allowed even if we disagree morally. 

Also, we are just taking op's word for it that the company was a 50/50 split between his mom and dad. It might have been, or it might have been a business that his dad had expertise in and the mom just helped him set it up while they were married. Like, what I'm saying is, the company might have always been his father's it's just that his mother, and by extension him after their father left, considered it half hers since she worked for it too. In a conservative/regressive country, this sounds much more likely to be the case. And yes, it could've been the reverse - that the mother had the expertise and the father just helped - but if that were the case I think he would've had a hard time keeping it afloat once he left his wife and took the company. Also, if that were the case I think op would've made it really clear to help justify his position even more.

I'm also guessing that, while this country they're in favours men with owning businesses, it might be so strict that it's difficult to divorce and remarry even for men, which might be why the father never divorced op's mother. I'm guessing the father continued to take care of op's mom and op financially per the laws of the country (often strict countries like this have laws that the man has to take care of his wife and legal child and can't abandon them) even if he didn't give them their fair share.

And you know what? You may be damning the father right now for taking advantage of sexist laws, but it sounds like op did too! I'm guessing he was only able to contest the will as the sole heir because he was a male ""legal"" child, thus taking the intended inheritance away from a woman and her children."

Generally this sub is MUCH MUCH quicker to blame the man in any kind of relationship/cheating/whatever situation. And really even this top-rated post fits that. While it says mistress, by extension that's the man (father) too being damned along with his entire new family with the original woman (op's mother and by extension op) getting the sympathy.

AmItheAsshole,fgj5vw4,t1_fgirvpv,1580837565.0,"He's vague because he wants us to think he's not the asshole, but it sounds more to me like, while the dad did take the business, the dad did not leave the mother with ""nothing"".

If your mom is giving you an allowance or you’re getting some extra money here and there to spend as you like, and the bills are really that tight, then she’s not really an asshole either, even though she could’ve handled it better since it was your money really.

Also I wish you’d stop worrying about money and, considering your position, use that hundred towards enjoying life rather than paying a hundred to an impossible debt; it’s really only a drop in the bucket. I understand wanting to be responsible but there’s a time and place for everything and to me this sounds like a situation to just say screw it and let those debts rack up as long as they can be put off for a year or more and don’t think about them. IANAL but I have a hard time thinking your parents could somehow inherit your debt. And without a spouse or children it seems like the situation would be your debt would go to no one after your passing. Of course I’d recommend checking this all out and consulting with a lawyer but with the position you’re in and the gargantuan medical bills piling up and wanting your last year to be as good as possible for you, that all is my thinking on it."

With the default premium view they’re just names basically so it’d actually be an easier task if I could do it with the non premium view and see album covers and quickly listen to samples.

LifeProTips,fg4khzs,t1_fg3y6lx,1580505146.0,"Okay, well if you’re so smart about Spotify then tell me this. When I had premium my playlists were large and unwieldy (thousands of songs in liked) and Spotify showed the list as simply the names of the songs. If I was making a new playlist by browsing, which I usually do, it’s awful because I don’t know so many songs and even lots of artists by name and if I click to listen I have to wait until the song really starts or make the screen bigger on the song then fast forward. So a hassle in other words. 

Now I was okay I guess with that because I didn’t know any better and used it like that for years.  But then I cancelled premium. I went back to my liked playlist from when I had premium, and lo and behold it’s a brand new look. Each song has the album larger by it so I can recognise a pic more easily AND most importantly the pics have a sample play button I can press to hear a quick sample of any song in the list with one tap. I love this!

My question is, can I get premium back and still have the playlist look like that? Is there a setting or way somewhere I don’t know about? Because if that view is only for non premium members then that’s ridiculously stupid."
