news,fefyeld,t1_fefxjdq,1579069418.0,"Can someone explain the legality of these communities? I get how agreements work (HOA contract), but a country's constitution is the highest authority, right? According to US constitution (I think, I'm not a US citizen) you're not allowed to discriminate based on age, just like you're not allowed on discriminate based on race, gender etc. 

Can a community exist that states that they're white/black only? Even if you sign the HOA contract and agree with them that you won;t have any black people living there, will that be enforceable?"

Christians (being like Christ) don't believe is marginalizing/isolating people that are different from them. Literally the only people that can get that treatment are 'false prophets' i.e. people that twist/lie about the contents of the Bible for their own gain. Why did Jesus get so much criticism for hanging out with all the 'misfits' of the time? Nothing changes"
