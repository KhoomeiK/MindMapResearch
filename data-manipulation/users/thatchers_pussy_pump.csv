Edit: Definitely not. Too much forest."
relationship_advice,ff78gkx,t1_ff6s9ql,1579643184.0,My favourite descriptor. This guy is a waste of space.
mildlyinfuriating,ff6ko1p,t1_ff6jl4q,1579629244.0,That's Reddit's ass.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff3ihqg,t1_ff3h5ew,1579541754.0,"Perhaps, but I'd be surprised if it showed up under the same declaration and endorsement schedules as one of their regular policies. It seems pretty reasonable to say that it would fall under personal accident, but there would be some fundamental differences between standard and special interests. Seemingly like the policy of Theseus lol."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff3fo0i,t1_ff38v9z,1579540091.0,"I'm not talking about ADD or special limits on home policies, but the loss of use on feet on a dancer or the theft of the watch.

Regular lines of business will have rates. Those oddball special interest policies are not regular LOBs and will not. Loss of *your* or *my* hand is a regular personal accident problem. Loss of Elton John's, on the other hand. No standard rates for that."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff386y1,t1_ff37xir,1579535986.0,"Definitely penises (penii?). But all of those one off things. Body parts, talents, high value collectables (this watch, supposedly)."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff36l43,t1_ff2rlmi,1579534907.0,I think there was an aspect of elitism in the Lloyds names days that decided reinsurance was boring so let's insure the sky falling.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff36ept,t1_ff2hy5x,1579534787.0,"If there are rates in a book for it, it's common, as far as I'm concerned. Might not be as common as PPA or IRCA, but it's not special interest."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff25zjp,t1_ff222vi,1579494762.0,"It's often just underwriters for common insurance lines of business (ransom insurance is kinda common). Celine Dion's voice or Julia Roberts's penis, that's another story."
science,fezz3ii,t1_fezw0ye,1579463406.0,"Which province are you in? I'm in BC and have some complaints about our pharmacare, but not that many. Considering that prescriptions seem to be covered after you hit a deductible based on your income isn't all that bad."
PoliticalHumor,fez7lt2,t1_feyxofh,1579454514.0,Smells like beaver.

unpopularopinion,fehhqww,t1_feh9c8s,1579116783.0,"Benefit of the doubt, though. I haven't crept his account, but maybe he doesn't know many other subs than defaults. My wife is on Reddit quite often and certainly doesn't know many subs.

Not guaranteeing, just saying it's a possibility."

ChicagoFireNBC,fdnkva6,t1_fdnglrv,1578587924.0,Straight up. I was laughing my ass off through that scene.
ChicagoFireNBC,fdmi1du,t3_elz6yx,1578550630.0,So... nobody gonna talk about the fact that a fire department was pursuing a criminal suspect (again)? Next episode prediction: everybody gets fired.

unpopularopinion,fc7xtvx,t1_fc7xg6t,1577521504.0,It absolutely does have to not interfere with new relationships for them to be viable. Letting go is part of moving on. But letting go also does not mean forgetting.
unpopularopinion,fc7xqht,t1_fc7xcm0,1577521437.0,I agree that that is a core issue. Loving more than one *living* person (in that way) would be complicated. I wouldn't envy someone in that position.

unpopularopinion,fc7xcbh,t1_fc7x7ea,1577521122.0,"Absolutely! Funny enough, a friend of mine is the husband to a widow from a similar situation. They celebrate the widower's birthday and do something positive on the anniversary of his death. I think it's healthy."

fuckthesepeople,fc4gdt6,t1_fc3iikk,1577415884.0,I 100% agree that there is no issue with charging for an overdraft. But moving charges around just to charge extra overdraft fees makes it predatory (like you said). I get the feeling that's the part of making money off poor people that people are taking issue with. I've never heard about this in Canada as it doesn't seem that our banks are out trying to screw people over to the maximum possible extent.

toptalent,fbwn7v6,t1_fbwllz2,1577154349.0,I like that kind of thing. Same with the vocoder use. Using it as an instrument (without using it) can be as good as any other instrument. Hide and Seek is a good example. But bad pitch correction robs the soul from a voice. And that is far too common.
