Because high playrates push winrates DOWN, due to increased sample size and bad players having more influence on the winrate, while low playrates push winrates UP due to smaller sample size and dedicated mains/one-tricks having more influence on the win rate. This is why no one cares about Alistar having a 54% win rate midlane, whereas Kaisa with a 48% win rate He's often considered okay or even a little bit on the strong side.

This is arbitrary and reflects nothing but values that society says are important vs values that society condemns (dating for looks).

There is no difference, objectively, between dating someone because they have big tits and cook a mean steak vs dating someone because they're hilarious and caring and sweet and intelligent. The only meaningful difference is that society condemns the former, condones the latter and attaches a bunch of judgments to both (""if you only date someone for their looks that you means you don't consider them an equal!"" Why? How so?).

And if you want proof of that look at divorce rates (which, ironically considering your attempt to paint this as a male-dominated issue, are initiated by women 66% of the time).

When Jax was assfucking the entire game with ardent, Hash was still finding ways to go 3/10 on him. Morde has been the strongest champion in the entire game for like a month and yet he has a fucking 40% winrate over 50 games with him, averaging 8 deaths a match. 

This hardcore cope needs to end. There is no difference in Hash' performance regardless of the champs he plays."

The fact that you have to qualify your statements with ""w-well if you play him into THIS type of lane"" is proof that he's not broken. Do you understand what a ""counter-pick"" is?"
leagueoflegends,fc7pxa6,t3_eggjhb,1577515572.0,"Mechanically he's an extremely generic mage that does nothing special. And he's not a waifu or a weeb-magnet like Yasuo so he has very little appeal outside of his kit.

Personally he's my most played midlaner this season."
