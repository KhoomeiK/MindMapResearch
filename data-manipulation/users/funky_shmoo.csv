On the physical side of things, it was all about experimenting with different positions and angles. Although I never really had the problem, if you're really out of shape that can make getting off more difficult."

It shouldn't be difficult to find though. It certainly shouldn't be your only source of information, but I think it's worth a watch. She demonstrated several techniques that I never would have thought of on my own. It helped me up my oral game."
sex,fcudo4x,t1_fcuc90u,1577978511.0,"I don't want to scare you, but in my experience women DO eventually get upset/hurt/insecure when their guy can't finish. If it happens once or twice most women will just shrug that off, but if it's the majority of the time eventually it'll become an uncomfortable topic of discussion. I've gone through this multiple times. It's never caused a breakup for me, but I'm not going to lie it's led to tears and angst on multiple occasions.


I wouldn't worry too much about it though. You can cross that bridge when/if you come to it. Perhaps the next time you throw down it'll all click into place, and you'll never look back. Or perhaps you'll end up like me, and develop the ability to finish in 10-15 minutes but retain the ability to go much longer (probably 50/50 for me to orgasm though) if you want to. Cutting down on porn in the short term probably isn't a bad idea though."
sex,fcubgak,t3_eiylmg,1577977072.0,"> For some guys its the opposite, but I think after having watched porn for the past 4 years of my life in addition to furiously jackin the ol’ beanstalk, it is **damn hard** to finish. In fact I didn’t even orgasm which made knowing when to stop sexxy time pretty difficult. I really meed to lay off the porn for a while.

You're not the only one dude. With my first several partners, depending on how the wind was blowing that particular day, I could hammer away from an hour or more and still not cum. In my case, my difficulty finishing wasn't related to over-consumption of pornography (porn was less available back then) but instead trust/vulnerability issues. It also took me a little while to suss out what I had to do physically to get myself off with a partner."

WTF,fcn2kq7,t3_ei027r,1577801492.0,"I just did a little math to get a sense of the scale of these wildfires. Most of the statistics I've seen come from Australian media, and the area of land burnt by these wildfires is given in terms of hectares. I know a hectare is 100 m x 100 m, but it's still difficult for me to visualize a large number of these units.

&#x200B;

* \~ 5,400,000 hectares burnt during this spate of wildfires
* sqrt (5,400,000) =   2,323 (If we think of the area burnt as a square, the square is 2,323 100 m units per side)
* 2,323 x 100 m = 232.3 km per side x 0.62 miles/km = 144 miles per side
* A square 144 miles per side is roughly 20,740 square miles 
* That's an area roughly equivalent to the land area of the US states Vermont, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island combined"

sex,fcku4gy,t1_fckn2o7,1577733235.0,"Hmmmmm. Discussing sexual performance (at it's root, that's really what it is) the first time is an especially delicate, and potentially damaging conversation. I'd been operating on the assumption that the issue was already out in the open, even if no steps towards resolution had been made yet. That would have made discussing addressing it much easier. 

At this point, I think I'll defer to others who've experienced this from the other side. I don't want to steer you wrong, and have it blow up in your face. Whatever you decide to do, I wish you both good luck."

&#x200B;

If you've already had that discussion, I think you can sell it to him as something that might improve your sexual relationship. There are many men his age that use Viagra/Cialis to enable sex, and some who use it purely for recreational purposes to improve (not enable) sex. If he wants to throw down with you, but his body simply isn't cooperating, there's absolutely no shame in seeking medical help."
sex,fckk5xm,t3_eho10p,1577727104.0,"I'm around your partner's age, and my ability to maintain an erection is generally good. He should get his testosterone checked, and eliminate that as a potential cause. My testosterone levels are fine, but occasionally maintaining an erection is a struggle for me. For those days, I have Viagra and it works wonders. Like sexually starved teenager levels of erection maintenance. At his age, it should be pretty easy to get a script for it.

&#x200B;

**From my experience Viagra improves sex in the following ways:**

1. I don't have to worry about whether I'm going to have difficulty keeping an erection. This makes sex much less stressful, and it also frees my wife from having to give me constant stimulation.
2. The lack of a need for constant/vigorous stimulation allows me to focus solely on her, and not have to worry about achieving/maintaining an erection later after I've gotten her off. This improvement is especially important to me,
3. Sex simply feels better with a rock solid erection.
4. Obviously this won't apply to every guy, but it also makes it easier for me to have multiple orgasms without stopping."

That said, one of my regrets is having sex with my then girlfriend when she was sick. Like 102*°* fever sick. I was just so damned attracted to her that I lost all sense of perspective. Once I'd finished and thought about what I'd just done, I felt like crap. I immediately began apologizing. She said it actually helped her feel better and wasn't at all upset, but I still felt awful. It was probably the most selfish thing I've ever done in my personal life. She had every right to be upset with me."
