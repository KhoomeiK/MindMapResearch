pregnant,fdj1w54,t3_eljaiz,1578456304.0,Nope. First and second trimester sucked. I think second was harder than first actually. Third trimester has been by far the easiest for me. Everyone’s experience is different.
askwomenadvice,fdhnbzv,t3_el7mjl,1578426289.0,"I wrote a thesis and a dissertation. Just know that that fear is real and its okay to be overwhelmed to the point of feeling paralyzed at times.

One of my most effective strategies was to break things down into concrete goals that were either completion-oriented or time-oriented. For instance, completion-oriented would be to complete transition paragraph to Chapter III vs. time-oriented would be to sit and work on writing Chapter III for a minimum of 2 hours today. I would often switch between these two depending on where I was in the process. However, I always tried to keep these goals realistic, concrete, and attainable.

Second, my strategy was to JUST DO IT - even if it sucks. I found that often times the most effort was in just making myself sit down and start a task, but once I started it, it wouldn't be nearly as bad as I had made it out to be. So I just started making myself do things. It didn't matter if the paragraph/wording was awkward or imperfect, the point was that I did it. Writing is a process and is never perfect in its initial draft.

Third, try to lay things and arguments out before writing. The more detail in an outline, the easier it is to write and tell the story. This isn't always feasible, but it can often help your story and logic by allowing you to identify holes.

Finally, be okay with letting things go! You will often find that you will have spent time researching and learning about a topic that does not have an ultimate home within your thesis/dissertation. Many times people will allow this to block their progress by trying to figure out how to weave it in, despite the fact that it creates a rabbit hole. Having a detailed outline beforehand can help prevent this from happening.

Using these techniques, I was able to finish both my master's and PhD on time."

MS has trained lots of educated and skilled laborers over the years, but they don’t stay bc there are no jobs to support their training. The reason we have a large number of unskilled and uneducated workers is bc those are the types of workers being called for. We’ve seen cities die bc jobs left despite there being an eligible workforce (e.g., MS delta, Memphis, Detroit, etc.). Conversely, there are cities that have been completely revitalized bc new industry came in and attracted a new workforce (e.g., Raleigh, Nashville, and Austin).
