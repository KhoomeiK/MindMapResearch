The world is destroyed, recreated, and God descends from Heaven to live on Earth in a giant crystal & gold city. Death and suffering no longer happens for anyone in New Jerusalem. Sin no longer exists either, primarily because one's entire existence is non-stop worship and praise at the feet of God 24/7, an eternity of praise in a monument to his own garish greatness.

So then people waited until 1000 AD. Nothing. Ok, maybe 1030 is it, a thousand years after Jesus started preaching? Nope. 1033? No. This kept up with every significant New Testament event until 1095, believed to be the anniversary of the writing of the Book of Revelation. Nothing. After that, Western Europe stopped sitting around waiting for the end of the world and instead started the Renaissance of the 12th century, precursor to the Italian Renaissance. Good news everyone, we have only 80 more years of this!

This was also when the Catholic Church realized that setting a date for the Apocalypse or even saying that it might be soon was bad for everyone. Yes, the Church received a lot of money & land from people trying to buy their way into Heaven, but farmers also refused to sow crops because why bother?

gifs,fcp6wwp,t1_fcp2t83,1577852477.0,"Property taxes in CA are based on events like ownership changes, remodeling, or disasters.

If someone sells their house, it gets reassessed at full market value for the new owner. Same with inheritance, marriage, divorce, or anything else that changes the owners.

If someone renovates their house, only the value of the modification is added to their assessment, not the full value of the property. So have a house locked in at $125k but worth $1 million and add a $25k kitchen to it, the assessed value is now only $150k. If the renovation isn't reported to the assessor and is found out later, they'll add ""escaped"" taxes to the bills retroactively along with fines.

Disasters result in lowered assessments and refunds if you've already paid your taxes for the year. It's prorated to the date of the disaster, same with ownership or renovation changes. Most states just bill the entity who owns a property at the start of the fiscal year and any proration is worked out at closing, but CA issues bills to each party for each event. A single property can generate many bills in a single year, especially with house flipping. One of the many unintended side effects from the tax revolution."
gifs,fcp14k9,t1_fcoysv9,1577847271.0,"I'm not OP but this is my subject matter area. Primarily it's unfair because these taxes go to fund state & local services that both homeowners use. Assuming they use the services equally, the new resident is greatly subsidizing the old. Yes, homeowner B may be wealthier than A but there's no guarantee of that, A might just be cheap. If the goal is to tax wealthy people at higher rates, do it through a progressive income or wealth tax instead. The current CA system locks in the idea of ""screw you, I got mine.""

The Props that set up the CA property tax system (Reagan's tax revolution!) were incredibly short-sighted and created a system so complex and arcane that they hire people like me to untangle their own data. If you think CA's property tax assessments are crazy, wait until you see how the money is distributed."
