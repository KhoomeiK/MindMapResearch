selfimprovement,ff76yjw,t1_ff76fh9,1579642340.0,"I was a mess for a few weeks. Could barely function at work. Ended up going to the ER for panic attacks. Started therapy and meds. Not much has changed yet, but hopefully it will. Try to take care of yourself. Shit like this can really crush our confidence. Its really hard to pull yourself back together.

At least we know we aren't alone in this."
selfimprovement,ff72qii,t3_erziql,1579639946.0,"My life has been upside down for a little over a month now. I caught my (now)ex of 7 years, talking to another guy. We broke up, I moved out into a shitty 1 br apartment that I can barely pay for. Still no furniture aside from a few dressers, a bed and my t.v. Work sucks right now because its the slow season so I'm barely getting hours. Every day I've just been lonely, anxious and depressed. I'm 35 and barely have friends. 

But. I still force myself to go to the gym almost every day, eat as healthy as I possibly can with my budget and trudge on. Even though every day is miserable, I keep going. It doesn't seem like its going to get better anytime soon, but what other choice do I have?

I have a lot of free time now since its just me. So I play my bass or workout. Its cold where I am and I don't have any money for hobbies. I'm thinking about volunteering at an assisted living facility. I just gotta keep productive and positive. Its the only thing that keeps me sane currently.

That said, my advice if you're like me is keep pushing and try to do positive, productive things. Even if you still feel like shit after and Theres no hope in sight.

Good luck, all."

nostalgia,fdnbaby,t3_em5p1i,1578582056.0,I had to stop drinking this in the early 90s. My parents were smokers. We were on vacation in FL and they thought I was done with my slice in our hotel room. I ran in and took a sip. Grossest thing ever. I threw up. To this day I still won't drink orange soda.
Mustard,fdlausw,t3_elz8tc,1578520105.0,"I make a dipping sauce for veggies. Mainly artichoke leaves and asparagus.

selfimprovement,fcn0zuh,t3_ei1wln,1577800116.0,"I wish I could be positive about it. I want to. But I lost everything just a few weeks ago. My love, our home, our cats. My entire world has been turned upside-down. Moving into an apartment Jan 2nd and going to struggle to survive in for who knows how long, with next to nothing in it. I'm scared as shit and afraid of 2020.

All I'm looking forward to are my psyche appointments in a few weeks. I cant handle the depression and anxiety anymore."
KitchenConfidential,fc1fa36,t3_eflmel,1577317023.0,"All of them unless I schedule a weekend day off.

Kinda got used to less traffic on the weekdays though."
