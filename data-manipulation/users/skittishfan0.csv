Ive made it clear not to contact me but I get little phone calls with “oops didn’t mean to do that” I can see go to places we’ve been or even go thru the town they live in. I’m just a wreck"

Eminem,femvol5,t1_femvk5y,1579270838.0,"Correct, I read actually the song beautiful he had written the first darker half in rehab and the second more brighter half of the song when he was out of rehab. Kinda nice to think. He had two different perspectives on it."
Eminem,femvf2c,t1_femvad9,1579270643.0,Well I mean his mind is always gonna work the same way right ? It his brain and wether being on drugs sharpens or being off drugs dulls it he still has the same train of thought
Eminem,femvbi4,t1_femv6ox,1579270570.0,Wildly incorrect. He went on a nice run and it evident by the lyric. “Encore I was on drugs relapse I was flushing em out” insinuating he had been fudged up the entire time until relapse

depression,fdbw2zd,t3_ekfp0m,1578262790.0,It’s the only time I get my mind to shut up. I have a weighted blanket and it makes me pass right out every single time. I feel ya.
