Experts aren’t completely sure but most believe it either was originally brought to the US from China or started in the US.

Shipping people to the warfront led it to spread to Europe where it eventually spread from France to Spain and unfairly was labeled the Spanish flu because Spain wasn’t at war so they weren’t suppressing news of the outbreak."
nba,ffo1802,t1_ffnp271,1580073087.0,"For helicopters it may actually be justified. Many metrics show it to be far more dangerous than cars (some show almost 87 times more deadly).

It should be noted that it’s hard to fairly compare the two because crash statistics are compiled differently for cars (miles traveled, number of registered vehicles, number of licensed drivers, and total population) vs helicopters (flight time)

todayilearned,fej76p5,t1_feiyesk,1579159753.0,">**About how much money have you given away?**  
I’ve given away in the range of $70 million in the last 30 years. I’m proud of that. I’m in a position to continue giving a lot of money away until the day I die. I really considered giving it all away at a certain point in my 20s, and I know people who did that. And I wish I could tell you that it was courage that kept me from doing that, but it was mortal fear. I didn’t think I would be able to survive. I was afraid I was a hothouse flower. I didn’t know if I could live on my own.  
>  
>Now I’m glad I didn’t give it all away, because my money has grown. Now I’ve given away so much more than I inherited. And I’m so much smarter now. What I would’ve done in my 20s would have been great and nice, but I’m so much more effective now."
