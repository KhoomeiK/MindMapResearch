history,ff9jvfz,t3_esapdu,1579714554.0,"Korea had some bad experiences with the outside world; Japan was ruled by barbarians who didn't properly follow Confucianism and had tried to invade Korea, and China was ruled over by barbarians after the Ming dynasty fell. With the Korean government following a very conservative version of Confucianism trade was also reviled and on paper limited to official embassies to and from Japan and embassies to the Chinese court.

As for European explorers, the Dutch did try to engage in trade with Korea but were told by the Japanese court that they would lose their trading rights with Japan if they did so, so it wasn't until the 1860s that European traders really became interested in Korea."
history,ff9jccd,t1_ff8x1go,1579714238.0,"Traders would usually travel part of the silk road and sell their wares to other merchants who would then transport it further along the road.

It's unlikely Chinese traders traveled much further than Central Asia. Even if they did, traders were held in contempt by most Confucians so any ideas they would have brought back wouldn't have been interesting to the government."
CrusaderKings,ff97alx,t3_esddpv,1579706511.0,"Rule 5: Started out as the count of Mohadavasaka and completed the White Hun achievement as the Emperor of Rajasthan.

Posting this because it's one of the achievements that gave me the most trouble. The ball got rolling once I managed to usurp the Kingdom of Malwa around 900CE and almost immediately converted to Zoroastrian through a concubine of mine. After that I could just holy war my way through India until I got a Child of Destiny. Using that guy's 90K armies I managed to take Transoxania from the dynasty that replaced the Abbassids and Tocharia from the Western Protectorate (for aesthetic reasons I also took the rest of the silk road from them).

Next I plan on becoming the Persian emperor and restoring the Zoroastrians fully and then take over India. I'm using this run to also get the 769-1453 achievement so I'm in for another 400 years of gameplay."

Anyway, I think something big is coming."

japan,ff5olqp,t1_ff5nzby,1579603460.0,"I think Koreans are annoyed because Japan seems to think that apologizing means that now we don't need to talk about stuff like comfort women or Japanese atrocities anymore.

European countries would be equally annoyed if Germany went 'alright we get it, but let's stop building Holocaust memorials now because it hurts our feelings.'"
europe,ff4qiwl,t1_ff4ei5a,1579570025.0,"My only problem with that is that I think it's unfair that those countries have to deal with our criminals while they already have a shit ton of other problems going on. 

Also makes me worried they'll try to do something similar when we want to send Syrian refugees back."
thepast,ff4pns9,t1_ff4nj1v,1579569426.0,"Snakeperson, did you forget what Master Meng said? 

'The people are of supreme importance; the altars of the gods of earth and grain come next; last comes the ruler. That is why he who gains the confidence of the multitudinous people will  be Emperor... When a feudal lord endangers the altars of the gods of  earth and grain, he should be replaced. When the sacrificial animals are  sleek, the offerings are clean and the sacrifices are observed at due  times, and yet floods and droughts come \[by the agency of heaven\], then  the altars should be replaced.'

The current dynasty is spent with people like you who haven't memorized all of the Classics! We need a real man on the throne. A man like Wang Mang!"

I'm not at my place right now but from the top of my head Extended Timeline and 'The Third Odyssey' or something similar to that were some of the mods I tried resubscribing to."

MapPorn,fet88r4,t1_fes01pn,1579372669.0,"I'd say those were extreme circumstances though.

Wilhelmina was something else though. During her stay in London she also slowly became convinced Dutch people wanted to give back a lot of power to the monarchy, which turned out not to be the case at all after the War. She was also strongly opposed to the 1944 customs union in the BeNeLux because she believed the Netherlands to be a great power compared to small countries such as Belgium and Luxembourg."

Imperator,fegg0vh,t1_fegfiep,1579091524.0,To me it kind of makes sense then that there are no Indian provinces that produce horses as their main resource in the game since no place outside of India would want to buy these relatively weak horses.
Imperator,feg6qbo,t1_feem35y,1579079585.0,"Was it? I always learned about the Mughals that they needed Kabul to keep importing horses from Central Asia, since the animals didn't do well in India."

todayilearned,fee6cz1,t1_fedsuak,1579027324.0,"The word 'algebra' doesn't have a religious or significant cultural meaning afaik.

As for Thursday, I don't think non-Germanic languages have named the fourth day of the week after the Germanic god of thunder (Jupiter-day in French, Wood-day in Korean are two examples I know)  so I don't think that's comparable either to using a Christian term for a calendar system that's also used in countries like China and Thailand."
