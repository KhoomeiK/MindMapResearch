television,fdzo8gd,t1_fdz8pyg,1578792374.0,"tl:dr  The showrunners wrote the ending of the series when they filmed the pilot and used it, discarding 9 years of character growth, and the lessons the characters experienced during the years with a horrible ""moral.""




The show is called How I Met Your Mother and starts with the Protagonist telling his kids if the future how supposedly he met their mother but inexplicably starts with meeting a random girl, Robin, at a bar and trying to date her.  Then there's a long meandering 9 year story regarding Ted dating Robin, breaking up with her, lots of stuff about the Robin and Ted, where Ted finally meets the mother [spoiler] (#s ""at the end of Robin's wedding to a mutual friend.  Oh, and the mother has died years ago.  The kids rightfully point out that he didn't need to include 9 years of banging Robin to just tell them he met their mother at the end of Robin's wedding.  Ted obviously still has the hots for Robin and the kids encourage him to ask a divorced Robin out, which he does exactly like he asked her out in the pilot"")





Now reading this plot doesn't sound so bad.  It'd be a cute little movie, and if the show had ended after 1 season then nobody would complain, this is the original ending the showrunners thought of when they made the pilot.  The problem is that the show ran for 9 seasons!  In order to fill time characters had to grow, character arcs changed, etc.  The ending betrays 9 years of character growth because [spoiler] (#s ""Ted and Robin date and break up because they're not right for each other multiple times.  The sitcom shows this again and again, yet the ending believes this time, as opposed to the other 2-3 times, is different.  Over the course of the series Barney, the philandering playboy, matures as a person, stops his philandering ways, and marries Robin.  The entire last season is Barney and Robin's wedding and the previous season is about Barney maturing enough to be the kind of person that Robin can marry.  The show at various times goes out of its way to show just how good Barney and Robin are together.  The finale has the two of them divorce 5 minutes in and Barney devolves back to being the exact same person he was in the first season.  A constant of the show was Ted prioritizing Robin over his SO's.  Ted has a chance to marry multiple women but because of his devotion to Robin the relationships fizzle out.  The ending makes it seem like Ted only stopped pursuing Robin once she was off the market (married) and settled for the mother in her absence after the mother got pregnant with their first daughter.  Ted, shown as a romantic at heart who idealizes the idea of marriage doesn't marry the mother until years after their two kids are born!  For a story supposedly about their dead mother, the mother is treated rather shabbily by the narrative and Ted, conveniently dying when Robin is back on the market so the two of them can try a relationship again!  The other main problem is that the mother is cast and played perfectly!  She is the perfect girl for Ted, their few interactions are amazing, everybody loves her!  So for the titled character to unceremoniously die in the finale so Ted and Robin can try having a relationship for the 3rd\4th time is a bit of a slap in the face."")

No idea why they used Cassie instead of Sin."
todayilearned,fdof6pd,t1_fdo682l,1578603956.0,"Because then you're living in Wyoming or Nevada!  There's a reason people choose to live in NY or CA despite high rent, and if all you care about is cheap land there are places in the world where land is cheaper and you're richer."
politics,fdki3fd,t1_fdkgqvj,1578504300.0,"Trump doesn't have to be smart enough to pull it off.  He just needs to do what Putin wants him to do, either because Putin told him to do it or because Putin tricked him into doing it."

Showerthoughts,fdhnpgf,t1_fdhmea9,1578426509.0,"Sure, the salaries are more but they can handle much more people\rentals.  You're not replacing a clerk at blockbuster with a software developer, you're replacing all the clerks in the state with a few developers."
Tivo,fdhmk45,t1_fdhkxs9,1578425823.0,"This is an AndroidTV box, since AndroidTV has a Disney + app, this will too.  But I agree with everything else."
Tivo,fdhh7a3,t3_elfej7,1578422574.0,"TiVo really should have done this years ago!  I definitely would have bought this years ago but now I'm already on the Apple TV ecosystem.

If it's good I might buy one but it'll be hard to compete with Roku, firetv, appletv,etc."

politics,fdez8kn,t1_fdewhqu,1578349760.0,"Check out the Oath keepers, members of the military and other positions that would keep their Oath to the Constitution and not follow an illigal order from Obama.  They were extremely active and considered themselves the front line against a power hungry executive branch.  The moment Trump was elected they all but disappeared, despite several times Trump giving illigal orders or promising pardons for doing illigal things."

This allows Bolton to have his cake and eat it too.  Bolton won't turn on Trump until Republican have agreed to turn on Trump."

Still, this is why I always prefer streaming boxes over Smart TV's.  My beautiful OLED from 2016 still looks great, but won't be receiving any new updated from LG.  MyAppleTV4k is still getting updates and new apps!"
