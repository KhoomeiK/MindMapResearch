I think you might want to talk to a doctor and make sure there is no physical cause of that on top of everything else. Also idk how much you eat l are eating or sleeping but if you go through periods where you don't eat enough that will make you feel sick even if you eat a lot at other times.

If I catch my depression early sleeping less (~7 hrs), running, etc help a lot to keep it from developing. I take meds all the time and those play a part but it still helps to get active, go outside, etc.

I'm sure your doctor has some great ideas though, you don't need to be suggesting medications to them. Just tell them you prefer meds tested and demonstrated to be effective for bipolar depression. You've got a lot of options. 15mg Ability is a low dose of a medicine that's not super effective anyway and SSRIs don't work well for many of us. I'm not surprised that it didn't stabilize you.

It's normal to drink and pee a lot an it can lead to DI (not relay to the blood sugar diabetes btw). They thought I had that because I peed so much. I don't pee THAT much though thankfully but we kept track of water intake and they tested how concentrated my urine is just to be sure and I read a lot about it during that period. In my case I've been on lithium for 7 years and I've drank a lot of water the entire time. It's only a problem because I like hiking and I have to carry a full day of water on my back.

BipolarReddit,fgsjupq,t3_f03fi2,1581086159.0,I do not recommend taking an over the counter supplement. Lithium is very effective but also very dangerous. There is a reason why your doctor will require blood tests for lithium level and thyroid function as well as urine analysis for kidney function. Don't do it alone and risk damaging two organs. Lithium also needs to be at a specific blood concentration to be effective as well as safe.
BipolarReddit,fgrj6mz,t1_fgrhbab,1581048161.0,"It's a solid plan. Filling low calorie foods are great. I'm personally a fan of snap peas (raw) and roasted broccoli or asparagus. If you feel like doing something more structured:

1) use the my plate method from the US government. Basically 1/2 your plate is fruits and veggies, 1/4 lean protein, 1/4 starch/whole grain, tiny bit of fat. I don't always stick to this but it's a solid plan for reasonably good nutrition.

2) actually count calories or similar.

I'm still on medication although I recently switched off of saphris for totally unrelated reasons. But I've kept the weight off for 2 years now and no longer have to count calories. This process helped me reset and learn a healthy way of eating that works with my altered hunger cues.  I basically had to relearn how to eat because the old way wasn't working anymore. You learn which foods are most filling to you, how much to eat and when to eat it, etc. 

Excercise of course means you can eat more and is good for your mood. I like anything I can do outside (running, walking, hiking, cycling). You don't have to exercise but there are a ton of benefits for weight control, mood, and overall health."
BipolarReddit,fgr5v87,t3_f00qhx,1581038903.0,Not risperidone... But I gained 25 lbs in 6 months on saphris on top of the weight I had already gained for to lifestyle changes/other meds. It really sucked. I county calories and lost 50lbs without changing my medication to doing excercise other than walking. You can lose weight on antipsychotics. Your appetite will be wonky but you can focus on low calorie filling foods. If you eat less than you burn you'll lose weight. If I were you I'd try to lose weight now rather than wait and need to lose more later.
BipolarReddit,fgr5jaa,t3_ezxu86,1581038674.0,"I don't know how much you took, and I'm not a doctor, but I did take codeine (Tylenol 3) for a few days with lithium and my doctor prescribed it knowing I'm on lithium as an alternative to ibuprofen, which interacts.

BipolarReddit,fgr007a,t3_ez1gtq,1581035150.0,I want to just say... I don't think anyone is wrong or lazy. And I know some stuff is hard or impossible. But I also think that we know what people in general need to be happy and you should do as many of those things as you can. Meds make you more stable they don't make you happy. Erratic sleep is a trigger. Drugs and alcohol are a trigger. People and situations can be triggers. We want to minimize triggers. We also want to do as many healthy happiness building activities as we can.  Do the things that make you happy not because they magically fix it but because not doing then hurts you. I think this is that the post meant - it's something you can do on top  of medicine to help more. It's important and it's helpful even though it's not everything. I know you can do these things and be unstable but I think you'd be worse if you didn't do it.

It makes sense to buy a puppy so you know that you can raise it well and have a happy, calm, well behaved dog who can guard you (if you want that) without being a threat. You know what I mean?

If you get a puppy you can be sure that you raise it to be a happy and balanced dog. If you get a puppy from a reputable breeder you'll know the dog is healthy and had the best start in life. We were planning to do that ourselves.

A friend reached out and asked if I wanted to re-home a dog he heard about from a friend. I was curious and was about to learn a lot about his background, socialization, and temperament and was able to meet him before agreeing.

It's not characteristic of bipolar disorder but it's common for people with bipolar to also have mood instability, sometimes caused by a personality disorder like BPD... Which basically means really unstable emotions. It's usually treated with DBT. DBT is great for all sorts of poor emotional regulation whether or not you have BPD. We can all use a little help regulating our emotions sometimes! 

""Labile mood"" is also a symptom of mixed episodes but I am assuming your therapist would recommend taking to your psychiatrist for a med change if they thought you were constantly in and out of mixed episodes. The fact that they recommended DBT makes me think it's more of an emotional regulation issue. I've done DBT on my own and in inpatient/partial and found it really helpful. Going to DBT helped me pick up the skills I didn't learn from my emotionally volitile parents and it's helped me so much."

It's also true that lack of sleep, lack of excercise, and toxic environments (including toxic relationships) will not just hurt, they will make it impossible to recover no matter what medication you are on.

Also want to add that I'm the most stable I've been while on the least medication I've been in (lithium level 0.9, latuda 60mg) and I think it's because I excercise every single day, prioritize sleep, eat healthy, spend time with people and animals who are good for me and love me, manage stress, use my CBT/DBT skills, etc. It doesn't work at once but applying all of these together consistently for long periods of time is going to make a huge difference.

They talked about what kind of life they wanted to build.

They took turns with childcare, hired a sitter as needed, etc. I'd go nuts if I had to spend all my time at home with children while my partner was with another woman.

It's like a perfect example of how not to have an open marriage to be honest. The people I dated weren't perfect but they were reasonable, happy, normal people."
TLCsisterwives,fgloh0g,t1_fgli3a8,1580906377.0,"I used to date a guy in an open marriage. They were pretty transparent. His wife always knew where he was, when he was with me, etc - usually I'd go hang out and sleep over at their house. They had a child so it made sense for me to go over there so she could still see her dad. She was too young to understand at the time but I believe they are just honest that Mommy and Daddy have special friends. She seems fine, I think they are very devoted parents. I think that instability is really bad for kids, I don't think that having a stable home plus mom and dad spend time with other friends is bad - they were always very clear that they didn't want anyone else to move in and wouldn't had kids with anyone else because they wanted a stable nuclear family for their children. So right from the beginning I knew that kind of future was off the table. I think they were really honest and upfront and I think that kind of communication is super helpful.

His wife would sometimes come home and tell us how a date went, it wasn't off limits or upsetting or anything like that. I met her boyfriend when he visited and we all watched TV together. He's cool too, we stayed in touch. I'm sure they have some jealousy at times but they didn't show it and seemed genuinely happy. She sometimes had people sleep over as well. They had a guest room.

 The difference is they chose this as adults, they are both financially and emotionally secure, and they stay because it works for them not because they have to. Both highly educated, both work, etc. They've already made a plan for how they would split assets if they wanted to divorce. Very emotionally independent people, they didn't really rely on each other for day to day emotional support.  Like they cared, and they were supportive, but they didn't seem to need that much on a day to day basis. 

Last I heard they were still really happy. I think that's really different from feeling forced into marriage to get it heaven and being financially trapped. They were exactly the kind of people you'd expect an open marriage to work for. I am very happily monogamous, and it wouldn't work for me, but I am glad I met them and have had that experience. It helps me appreciate what I have now too. I AM someone who wants a lot of emotional attention, support, and stability in my life. I wouldn't want to see my boyfriend's other girlfriend over breakfast. But that's why I chose monogamy."

running,fgghlsy,t3_ey81y6,1580762040.0,"Dude I just want to run with my dog. I used to run with this great doggo who loved 5ks and could match my pace so I just did that every morning. He's an old boy now and mostly sticks to walking with my mom (I don't live there anymore) so for a while I ran by myself, but I recently adopted a puppy and it's nice to have a run buddy again. He's fast too. Lots of dogs are naturally good runners and enjoy the run enough to stop trying to pee on everything, etc.

Some people do long distances, some short. Some people race, some doesn't. Some people run to compete against themselves. I just want to stay fit, get out outside, feel those endorphins, and have a great time with my dog. I'm probably the most casual runner on here, I don't mind. I'm still running."

All you can really do is apologize (look up steps to a good apology) and demonstrate that you're doing everything in your power to prevent this from happening again. Meds, therapy, support groups, sobriety, maybe even some anger management. She needs to feel safe before she will consider coming back.

I hate to say this but she might never feel safe enough to come back. The people I manic raged at never talked to me again and I'm a tiny woman. Manic people are terrifying regardless of size or sex. You need to focus on what you need to do to repair your life not your relationship or reputation. Most people will forget. You need to live with this for the rest of your life. Focus on what you need to do to stay stable and prevent another episode. It you go to a group like NAMI or even AA I bet you'll find a lot of people who scared their partner and friends. Go talk to them."
BipolarReddit,fggctfc,t3_eycjox,1580759164.0,"I know weight is a sensitive subject but my opinion is that it's better to gain weight than be unstable, unable to take care of yourself and your plants, etc. Being unstable has a much bigger impact on quality of life than being overweight. You are in a better position to lose the weight if you are stable. That's what I did, now I'm stable, thin, and have great excercize habits that hello me stay stable and thin so I'd say the plan worked out.

What you are doing isn't working. It's not going to magically start working. That means you need to make some changes. No to quote AA at you but...(note: I'm not in AA but a lot of my friends are) ""if nothing changes nothing changes."" What changes can you make? I can help you brainstorm."

DuggarsSnark,fgfkq41,t1_fgfi25z,1580741367.0,"I agree with you I just don't care enough about football to be current. I know some players committed domestic violence and no one is in the league cared, but I don't think I know enough to add anything to that conversation. I tuned in for the half time show and then turned it off. I only commented on the costumes... Because that's the topic of the thread. It's not that I care more about the costume than the violence. 

I also want to clarify that I am not blaming the preformers. I'm blaming the music industry for bringing in young girls, often minors, enticing them to preform half naked, then dumping them when it harms their mental health. It's not like these costumes exist in a vacuum where that pressure and violence isn't a part of the equation."
DuggarsSnark,fgfgc5q,t1_fgelox1,1580737931.0,"I honestly wasn't a fan of the costumes. Yes, I know JLo and Shakira are grown ass women who can dress themselves... But I hate that this is what's normal for female singers. It's what is expected. So no hate on them in particular, but the entire system where you need to show your ass to sell tickets is bullshit. Less pressure to show skin ==> more choice for female preformers.

What I do know is that if your mental state hurts your quality of life it's time to get professional help. You can ask your GP for a referral or find a psychiatrist from your health insurance website. They won't tell you that you are fine and send you home. They might do medical testing or recommend therapy. Or they might recommend medication (Or all three). You can choose to take it or tell them you don't want it. You are in control. I promise if you are in distress they will try to help.

relationship_advice,fge8ksl,t1_fge6e5u,1580693817.0,I think it's not a good idea to set your happiness on someone else's behavior when they are clearly a mess. It's been two years. She's not going to leave on her own. It sounds like a one foot in one foot out situation. They are seperated in the sense that she's seeing someone else and sleeps in a different room. But they aren't really seperated in any real or legal sense. It's codependent and unhealthy. Her girlfriend sleeping over is the least of the problems here.
Fitness,fge8c0l,t3_exwffo,1580693651.0,"I took my boyfriend skiing for the first time a while ago. Based on that, these are my recommendations:

* When you ski you are kinda crouched down. Do squats and wall sits.

* Learn how to fall and wear a helmet. You can rent them. You want to kinds crumple to fall slower and try to Lang on your butt or crumple to the side. Don't stick your arms out. Try to roll with it. It's ok if your skis pop off, that's a safety feature.

* Rent poles and use them for balance, no need to plant them when you first learn. 

* Invest in at least one lesson or ask a friend to coach you. I was able to give him a lesson and I think that was helpful but a pro would be better. You will probably improve a lot but it will be hard at first. If you don't know how to do something ask! You should know that there are two styles. Beginners tend to put their skies in a wedge shape. Eventually you'll keep them parallel. You don't necessarily want to copy more experienced skiers for this reason. 

* There is probably a lodge with beer and hot chocolate. I recommend hanging out there and resting a few times during the day. If you push too hard you'll have a bad time the next day. Also take time to stretch!"

She's a capable adult and she needs to sink or swim without you. To deserve so much better. This is codependent. I really really recommend reading about codependency.
