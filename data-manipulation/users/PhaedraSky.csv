EntitledBitch,femyke4,t3_epuwhr,1579272910.0,The only reason why I think you should keep your fucking mouth shut is for the kids. If you really feel like your husband isn't enough then suggest an open relationship but lying to him and fucking other men behind his back is disgusting and I only hope you can have an open relationship talk with him before he catches your lying ass. And let me add that you're nasty! You're taking a chance of bringing home an std. Us nice girls often wonder why guys always cheat and it's probably because of sluts like you.
MONSTERCOCKS,femxxwf,t3_epstak,1579272478.0,"You're cheating. Some of the lid is pushed into the body where that area isn't able to penetrate anything. And don't be a fraud, use a ruler."

I've been watching Max Igan (TheCrowHouse) on youtube and this shit is scary. I'll post one of his videos.

So please, please be careful and stop taking that shit. Get a medical marijuana card and use that for your medicine. I know that I'm just some random person on the internet but I care too."
TrueOffMyChest,fddl46k,t3_ekkz4g,1578316425.0,"It's like that at my job sometimes. I'll go to lift something only to have a guy push me out of the way while saying ""it's cool, I gotchu"". I hate that shit. Or ""oh you're a rigger? You a ground rigger?"" Then I tell them that I can up rig too which means pulling 100 lbs of chain into the air and they act astonished that I can do it. I know that I'm little but damn don't underestimate me."

AmItheAsshole,fch3q9h,t3_eh6n83,1577646971.0,"Kids really shouldn't even be asked to call their step parents mom or dad. My mom remarried and my sister called him daddy Steve and I called him steve but look, I was about 8 and my sister was 3. I have an ex that had a 3 year old and got her on the weekends. I never asked her to call me mom. One day at school she told the teacher that she had 2 moms and I was so proud, it almost made me cry knowing that SHE made the choice to call me that. You're 17, almost 18 so you already have your mom engrained in everything that you are and life long memories as where a child might forget or could form other memories. She should never ask a person your age to call her mom and you're not wrong if you choose to never call her mom. Also I think that boundaries and rules should only be set for children and young teens that don't or won't clean after themselves or take responsibilities. As long as you and your brothers are doing an equal share of the work and you don't have to be asked to do it then there's no reason to EVER set rules for you guys. Rules are only for those that don't know how to control themselves.

Sorry for any issues I'm on mobile. 

I think your dad would benefit from reading this as well."
AmItheAsshole,fcdyzg5,t3_eh1it3,1577615223.0,"NTA and don't feel bad for going too far and making her cry. How many years has she been making you cry with her nasty comments? My mother did this shit to me too. Always called me fat even though I was 4'11"" and weighed 105lbs which is not fat! Don't put up with that shit."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcdwqbn,t3_egw34j,1577614632.0,Here is a huge hug for you. I'm sorry that someone did that to you. I hope they catch their toe on something and it hurts really bad.
relationship_advice,fcdvoip,t3_egvkbr,1577614320.0,I would also be making a trip to this church and speaking to the priest that did the baptism. Only the parents can have a child baptized and I think the church is also at fault here. I'm not sure how they did it but you need to find out. It sounds like you and your mom were in a good place before this happened so my advice is that IF your relationship with your mom was really strong then perhaps talk this out and make her understand that she has NO RIGHT to EVER make these choices for your child. If that's possible then that's my suggestion because it's either that or cutting her out of your life.
AmItheAsshole,fcdsdxy,t3_egu9xa,1577613182.0,"NTA - rounding the size up like that just makes sense. Also I just want to add that I'm glad that you're happy with your ring. I see too many posts about women being angry. I actually refuse to wear a diamond and I prefer just having cubics or my birthstone which is blue zircon. My wedding band is just a stainless steel band that costs maybe 10 dollars. I feel better about it for several reasons but the biggest is that if anything ever happens (robbed etc.), I can always replace it. For work, I wear a silicone band because I'm an aerial rigger and I don't want to lose any fingers. You might consider a silicone band yourself because it lays flat, doesn't hurt since it's flexible and it won't harbor bacteria."
