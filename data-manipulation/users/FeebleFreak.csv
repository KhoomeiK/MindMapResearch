I simply want the best open back experience that will get me amazing comfort, great sound and will be reliable for many years to come without needing a dedicated amp/dac setup. 

I'm not necessarily looking for an audiophile experience, but I am looking to see if I can improve my current experience. Budgets no concern after headphones I've heard (598, HE400, Audeze LCD2, Oppo PM3, V Moda Crossfade 2, DT770 Pro, Zero Audio Tenore) on Magni Schiit, and HA2-SE amps.

I guess my question is what is the best open back experience I can get without necessarily needing an amp.

I'll take at the Focal Elex. Looks promising 👍"

I settled on these 598's and I don't see myself getting rid of them, *unless* there is something that does what it does better. 

There are a pair of HD700s on my local Craigslist...
