That Luke also learned that Darth is his father. He was an underdog with no family left other than his father and lost his mentor. He also *did* attack Vader in anger but still prevailed over it in the end. 

TLJ saw a Luke that was corrupted by authority, fear, etc by giving him responsibility and legend. He started to believe he was the first line of defence against the ‘dark’ side and saw any wavering in his student Ben as his own flaws. Luke was tempted, I don’t see how that’s bad.

He is an “agent”, not for reality, but a world of objects and simulacra, for representations of reality. 

Likewise, in real life, those institutions that rely on representation and organising society into organisable chunks and systems contain within them not a blanket misanthropy alone, but often ends up being coded to be unequal in its hostility depending on how the institutions are formed by the people managing them. 

As a character to us, humanity, the idea isn’t that he is angry technology, that is ultimately philosophically meaningless to us and might as well be an uncooperative printer if that were the case. No, the idea is that Smith is the personification and agent of authority and institution that wants to control your perception—and undoubtedly consistent theme within the Matrix media is that the Matrix and it’s agents control your perception and hide between the gaps of your mind.
