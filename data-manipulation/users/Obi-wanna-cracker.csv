ForFashion,ffiwrfk,t1_ffiwnqs,1579984590.0,Ya that's true. You could also say the same about the raining arrows. Maybe not as accurate as the catapult but still accurate
ForFashion,ffiw71i,t3_ett0we,1579984184.0,"Can we talk about how the samurai are amazing archers? Like in game? They can hold the arrow back for a while and usually can hit their target. Then again its impressive that the heroes in game can take a heavy attack to the head and survive.

OTMemes,ffipfde,t1_ffimhb4,1579979435.0,Han became a target by the empire when he helped luke destroy the death star in a new hope but they put no bounty on him. They simply just hired bounty hunters to help track and find him. Han just simply owed money to Jaba and because of that jaba put a bounty on his head. Vader did say during the carbonate freezing that is he died then boba would be compensated for the death.
ForFashion,ffip4qk,t1_ffi6vl7,1579979227.0,Thats were you play player vs AI. Usually you can finish a round of breach much faster with AI rather then a regular breach match.

forhonor,ffhk24o,t1_ffha5wl,1579938860.0,"Id give it more love if there was more story. Id like to have story after Apollion when the rest of the world continued to go at war. Imagine playing gladiator and having to survive waves of enemies in an arena. Or playing centurion in a war zone against the wu lin.
Or playing black prior during a crusade! And that's just the knight heros!"

OTMemes,ffhie2o,t1_ffhi8kz,1579936623.0,I'm pretty sure she knew. Remember when Han said to the commander in ESB on hoth?He says he needs to leave as he has money on his head. All the while Leia is listening.
Doom,ffhibcq,t1_ffhgoi0,1579936523.0,"Well he did become taller because of the Spartan argumentations to his body but the Spartan mjolnir armor did add I think it's almost a foot of height. I could be wrong about the suit. In lore i think chief is like 6 foot 6 but with the suit he is 7 foot something. 

Though there is fair evidence to think he could have grown at least 6 foot if he didn't become a Spartan. The Spartan II's were picked because they were best of the best and and unique genetic markers. Meaning he was already strong and smart before the program took place."
gaming,ffhez0v,t1_ffheug9,1579932458.0,I just don't trust myself enough. Id rather just prop it up with some note books instead of taking the thing apart and run a chance if losing one small thing.
ForFashion,ffherxl,t1_ffhb3rk,1579932244.0,He probably plays a lot of breach as well.
ForFashion,ffheps7,t1_ffgwzis,1579932177.0,"From what I'm aware one of the most effective xp farms in for honor is breach AI matches. Breach gives the most base xp when finished and in some cases the AI can be known for not reacting to certain moves. Like fighting an AI BP is pretty easy as they stay in all guard for a fair amount of time. Enough for you to guard break and side heavy. Basically they can be finished quickly whilst getting a tone of xp in the process. 

I remember a post with a rep 9 Sunday (my Nick name for the new wu lin hero since Idk how to spell) maybe 2 days after he was released."

But all im gonna say is that I don't want to be judged because I need to cry sometimes. I'm just bottling up my emotions to make sure I'm not judged for having emotions and it just hurts to hide that.

Tap into the dark when you need and stay in the light. Don't allow the darkness to consume you and have different beliefs with the force. 

The grey Jedi code is a mix of both sith and Jedi codes 

There must be both dark and light. I will do what I must to keep the balance, as the balance is what holds all life. There is no good without evil, but evil must not be allowed to flourish. There is passion, yet peace; serenity, yet emotion; chaos, yet order. I am a wielder of the flame; a champion of balance. I am a guardian of life. I am a Gray Jedi.
