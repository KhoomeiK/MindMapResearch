AskWomenOver30,fed4h73,t3_eoe7ak,1578998394.0,"I don’t!! And I try not to get down on myself about it and you shouldn’t either! You could try simplifying your skincare routine. I agree with what someone else said about leftovers. I live less than 5 minutes from my parents house, so i go there for  dinner often.  
When I have multiple things to do, I take stock and ask ‘will anyone die if those dishes sit until tomorrow? Or those clothes wait until later? ‘ We’re human beings( most of us). It’s okay to let things slide a little bit.  Decide what is most important to you and put them first ."
