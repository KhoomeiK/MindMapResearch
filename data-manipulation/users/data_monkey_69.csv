The best source to learn from is an actual person, so a parent, friend, grandparent etc. it helps if they’ve been doing it a while and are sort of crusty. 

I was fortunate to work for a cabinetmaker/furniture maker in my youth, which was an education of a lifetime. 

I started learning this stuff before this new-fangled Internet was around , so I also spent a great deal of time at the library reading fine woodworking. 

I build mostly furniture. Before you try to do fancy joinery, you need to learn to make things flat, square and uniform. If your butt-joint ain’t 90 degrees, your dovetails ain’t gonna be either. Don’t try to run before you walk. 

Make sketches and plan through the joinery. Equally as important, think through the sequence and order of operations in terms of what parts of the project need to be completed first and what order assembly should occur in. 

Also, always be cognizant of orientation (I.e, does the project have a top, bottom, left or right). It’s easy to make wrong cuts if you don’t remember and mark orientation. 



Focus and practice the fundamentals, acquire the tools you need as you go and start building things that are useful."

But, like all things vintage/collectible, just because it’s old doesn’t make it valuable and unless you know what your doing, you probably won’t make a steal, unless you get lucky. I assume the seller knows what things are worth. 

If your looking to buy and resell, do your homework and look for the good stuff. There are lots of vintage auction sites where you can see what is selling for what price. 

If your looking to build your tool arsenal, then look for good to fair condition metal planes, a jointer, smoother and a block plane would be a good place to start (Stanley/Bailey is a safe bet). 

Look for a nice rip, crosscut and dovetail saw (disston is a safe bet). 

Measuring and marking tools are always nice to have. 

I’d stay away from vintage chisels if there is any rust etc.
