M being gay has barely anything to do with any of this. It was inappropriate of your husband to secretly go out with her after knowing it makes you uncomfortable. I don't know how he acted with her when you weren't around so I can't say whether or not his relationship with her is indeed platonic, but the fact that he hid it disrespects your marriage and your feelings are valid.

However. You did wildly overreact and lashed out at M without even actually knowing if they did do something inappropriate together. Does she even know you're uncomfortable with her being around your husband a lot? Do you have reasons to not trust your husband? Probably should have sorted it out with your husband in couple's therapy first."
AmItheAsshole,ff9bqye,t3_escpo7,1579709342.0,NTA. It's just a name and even if it's kind of a joke name at least it's not overly ridiculous like Princess Consuela Bananahammock. Or Crap Bag. Like I'd rate it 4/10 for weirdness. Doesn't mean you don't love your daughter or are setting her up for bullies. Bullies exist regardless so just teach her how to deal with bullies. Even then I think other kids won't really make that big of a deal.

TooAfraidToAsk,febv0fi,t1_feavoir,1578963051.0,"I don't personally know you, but psychologists do say narcissism is the number one reason for cheating. And you certainly sound narcissistic for feeling like you're the only ones who get lonely and horny in the relationship. I admire the courage to post an honest comment but still, big yikes. If you hate long distance so much then don't involve another person in that shit, that way you can at least be honest about your pimp ways, simple as that."
TooAfraidToAsk,febtbed,t1_fea8jis,1578962455.0,So sorry to hear that. I hope that doesn't encourage you to do the same to future partners though.
TooAfraidToAsk,fe9jsmz,t1_fe9jhbm,1578938374.0,"Exactly. I get the sense that they feel like serving in the military makes them feel like saints/heroes and it therefore excuses them from other shitty deeds. Sorry to hear about what you went through, mate."
TooAfraidToAsk,fe9jheo,t1_fe9j61q,1578938185.0,I got cheated on by a military guy as well. Thinking about it...maybe it feels shameful because despite being warned about dating military guys we still gave them the benefit of the doubt. Sorry that piece of trash treated you like that.
