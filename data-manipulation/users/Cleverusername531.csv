TrueAskReddit,fgm5uck,t3_ezbdc1,1580918529.0,"Are you able to take breaks? If you can protect your time to take at least three solid breaks so that you are intensely focused on something that is not work and not demands on your time (taking a slow walk in nature for 15 mins, listening to a guided meditation, doing a high intensity short workout in the middle of the day), that will help reset your mind so that when you’re off, you’re not totally depleted. 

You’ve also demonstrated that you have the discipline to work hard and keep pushing yourself. Do you think it would work for you to transfer that mindset to join a yoga (or hiking, or tai chi, or whatever - mindful movement) class that meets on your days off? That will give you time to sleep in but also get you out of bed and get moving in a way that doesn’t further beat you down. 

How is your sleep, nutrition, and exercise? You need to deliberately eat nutrient dense foods, set conditions of good sleep by using sleep hygiene, and exercising every day to help you maintain this marathon pace. If you’re on your feet all day, do exercise that counterbalances what you’ve been doing all day (a [seated](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RQyX48NtDrQ)  or inverted [like aerial yoga ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9b03ZVyAkC0) or pole dancing type of exercise)."

If they’re traveling, send them a letter to their hotel to say “have a great time! I heard this place has a neat concert going on this week, you should check them out on Thursday!” Or “I found this restaurant which specializes in your favorite dish, can’t wait to hear what you think of it”

Mail them a coupon for Netflix and chill. 

If they’re sick or have had a bad day, send chicken soup or whatever their comfort food is via Uber eats or other delivery service. 

Have a friend or coworker put a flower or other meaningful gift on their desk (so you’re not paying ridiculous delivery fees or having to coordinate getting past work security)

Send them a calendar invite for a couple months out, to their email or phone to pop up and tell them a nice message. They’ll see it when you send it, but then forget till it comes up again. And of course you should probably delete the invite if you break up before then lol.

That way they don’t have a sense that they don’t know what’s going on and whatever is going on could be bad. 

For example, if you have to take medication every day, let them know that you have one of those daily pill dispenser things and that’s what reminds you to take the medication on time.

When I get into a groove of exercise, I find it easier to stay in that momentum and keep exercising. When I stop, though, it’s much harder to start again because of anxiety making it hard to leave, or depression and lack of energy, or PTSD flashbacks that make it hard for me to move my body because of the specific type of trauma I experienced. So I make it so that it’s easier to work out than to skip a workout (I always have gym clothes where I can find them quickly, I have plan A and B in my head so that if I don’t feel like going to the gym, there’s a walking trail, and if it’s raining then I either walk anyway or I do body weight exercises inside, and I have a friend who helps me get back into things by encouraging me to just take a quick short walk and if I don’t want to I can turn back - and most of the time I’m feeling good by then and don’t want to turn back, but if I do then at least I’ve maintained the momentum of moving every day). 

Setting conditions for good sleep is crucial. I usually can’t control whether I actually do sleep, but having a dark cool room with earplugs in, avoiding electronics before bed, reading a physical book, taking a hot bath before bed, stretching, having that kind of evening touring sets me up for the best likelihood of having good sleep. If I still don’t sleep well, then I just don’t, but it’s not because I set myself up for a bad night because I drank coffee too late in the day or stayed up all night on reddit or something. 

I’ve been on online mental health support groups before but don’t now. I also do art therapy.

TooAfraidToAsk,fepbakf,t1_fep72e8,1579316344.0,I hadn’t heard that version but I like it. I agree that it doesn’t apply in this case but it does apply in so many instances I can think of!!
askamanager,feoxmv2,t3_emdrnp,1579307609.0,"I’d email the manager back and say, thanks! Because it comes up so rarely (twice in six months), I’d definitely benefit from some scripts when the caller just wants to speak with the manager anyway. Most of the time the caller accepts my answer that you will say the same thing I am, but there are definitely those times where they refuse to be satisfied till they speak to the manager. Obviously I don’t want to just hang up on them or leave them angry, so I look forward to talking with you Monday and getting your insights. 

Probably a bit passive aggressive."
askamanager,feox38n,t3_eq5wrx,1579307273.0,"Writing good performance reviews - sitting down with employee and agreeing upon written goals, having frequent informal check ins and then quarterly formal check ins. This allows employees and managers to course-correct as needed, so that the performance review is not a surprise, and so that the manager isn’t trying to remember a year’s worth of performance!"
TooAfraidToAsk,fensocs,t3_eq331r,1579290123.0,"This made me think of the saying, “If it sounds stupid but it works, it’s not stupid”. 

You have something that needs to be done (dishes). You have an obstacle (feeling lazy). You have a solution to overcome the obstacle (wash dishes in bathtub). You’ve successfully done some good problem-solving. Seems pretty acceptable to me."

2. NSV: You committed to 30 days. Do 30 days and you will be proud you accomplished this!

3. My NSV: I stopped having to take ibuprofen for joint pain after week 2. My sinuses cleared up after that time too, and I stopped having headaches and having to take Sudafed and steroid nasal spray. 

4. My brain was clearer - I felt much more mentally agile and didn’t get tired of thinking (my job is complex and I feel like I’m cramming for a term paper every day, on a new subject every day!). 

5. If you’re bloated, you can try a good journal to see what foods you eat that make you bloated. Some culprits are [FODMAPS](https://www.monashfodmap.com) - garlic and onions are the worst culprits even though they’re great for you nutritionally, too much fiber too quickly with not enough water, and too much meat without enough fiber. Try cutting back on fruit to see what happens. 

6. Go exercise! Move your body around to get the bloating moving. 

7. Get a belly massage - that also helps bloating. Lots of massage therapists do it. Or try doing it yourself. 

8. Go focus on something you love doing. Read, knit, hike, bike, make art, make music. Catch up with friends. 

9. Try something new! Meetup app has lots of interest groups, try something you’ve never done. 

10. Go to a shelter and walk and pet the animals. 

11. Write in a gratitude journal. 

12. Shift your focus away from Whole30 and how you look and what you’re doing. Go live life! (Obviously still eat Whole30, but don’t think about it the rest of the time. Accomplish not thinking about it by actively thinking about and doing other things. Post on here or write down in a journal or email a friend the things that you want to do, and the things you did. 

13. You got this!"

legaladviceofftopic,femom0d,t3_epvkqv,1579264862.0,"Get a PO Box and set up mail forwarding from your house to the PO Box. The mail will never make it to the house in the first place; it will all go directly to the PO Box. You can do this all in one trip to the post office.

Also, withholding mail is a federal crime, even if they live in the same house as you. next time they hint at this, shrug as if it didn’t matter to you and say, “if you want to commit a third degree felony, I guess that’s on you”"
