I think that linking studies like this dude did is stupid as fuck at best, because it does nothing except promote the team sports view of politics that's got us to this point in the first place. Just saying ""SEEEEEEE THERE'RE STUDIES THAT SHOW YOU'RE DUMB SO YOU'RE WRONG"" is just straight up cancerous in my mind. People think the way they do for a reason, and more often than not they aren't stupid reasons even if I disagree with them"

Everyone sucks here, because of the things she did to you and because you are unwilling to recognize how hard it could be for someone to apologize like that.

But you're an asshole for your response to her. You didn't even acknowledge that she was a person you knew at one point, and that she at least tried. You didn't try at all, and chose to double down on the toxicity and negativity, and funnily enough, you sound exactly like a bully. I suggest you talk about this to your therapist and try to grow up a little."
