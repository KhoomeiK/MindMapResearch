I was responsible for checking in the trucks and trailers in the morning. I was pulling out a 26’ truck and slightly grazed my friend’s pickup truck, leaving a scrape and a dent behind the wheel well. 

I felt terrible. I told her about it and she took it pretty well, but my boss gave me a write up for it. My friend felt bad about the write up so she baked me a plate of cookies, which were awesome. 

Anyway, she and her mom called u-haul and they paid for the damage to her truck pretty quickly, which I thought was amazing because they really had nothing to do with it."
