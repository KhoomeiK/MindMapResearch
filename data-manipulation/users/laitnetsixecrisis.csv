I had to tell them that is NOT a word they are to use, all whilst keeping a straight face.  The context was correct and he wasn't being derogatory.  How they are in their teens it's a funny story (for some) thst I use to embarrass him."

We have the right to protest, and while that does come with consequences, no one deserves to be told to kill themself.

 I think when a child tells their parents they're gay sometimes there needs to be a mourning period for the life they have planned out.  It is getting easier to be gay in most communities than in the past, but it's still not as easy as a hetero couple.

I have 2 boys, I've always used the words ""if and when you have a girlfriend or boyfriend...""  because I want them to know that either way it's normal and I would accept them.  I do think I would be worried that their lives would have an added difficulty level if they were gay."

TrueOffMyChest,fdmzb88,t3_em85jd,1578572260.0,"I think your insecurity of being not good enough is influencing your feelings of being readily replaced.

I have a question, do you masturbate when away from your girlfriend?  Sex toys aren't  replacement, they are an addition when being used with a partner, and something to let off steam when alone.  

Everyone does feel insecure during their life, I'm 36 and have many moments of feeling like people would be better off if I was somewhere else.  I have found learning to feel comfortable on my own has helped me feel less insecure.

This is a hard thing to do at 17 though, you're still working out who you are and what you want your place to be in the world.  

I found going places like the library, or a quiet coffee shop with a book or even just Reddit on my phone slowly built up my confidence as I learned that the only person who is truly concerned about me is me.  

I get it is hard when your parents compare you to other people, I have kids and try not to do this, but sometimes it happens.   From my experience when I fall into this behaviour it's generally because I am frustrated that  my kids are not putting in the effort they should.   Where I am from classes get grades on academics and effort, if they get a D for academics, but an A for effort I am happy, if it's the other way around I am not, and this is where I might compare them to someone else.

I'm not saying it's excusable behaviour, but sometimes as parents we forget what it was like to be a young person, and try to encourage you the wrong way.

You sound like a well spoke young man, and quite articulate.   Things do get better with age, unfortunately age takes time."

AskReddit,fdittlt,t1_fdisc2z,1578450892.0,"We have what is called the Medicare levy surcharge. Basically it's a tax that is reliant on your income.  If you're single and earn under $90,000 AUD a year, you pay nothing, if you have a family you are allowed to earn  $180,000 before having to pay anything.  The rates are 1%-1.5% of your income, depending on how much you earn.  

If you chose to have private health insurance you can claim some of the premiums on tax, I am not sure how that works as, I don't earn enough to have to pay a levy and as I am currently on an unemployment benefit I don't pay tax.  

I guess it's just a matter of priority for governments and typically politics.  I'm not too sure on how it was introduced as policy, someone else may have better information than I do.  I believe it was the Labor Government that implemented the Medicare system and Labor focused more on social development compared to the Liberals who are more focused on privatisation."
