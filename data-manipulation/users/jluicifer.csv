Why? As Americans, we view ourselves as the best and the most right but if we are true to ourselves, we could admit our flaws and be patient with opposing views. I do not condone the actions of the Nazi regime, but there are good people who are sucked into the culture of the times while still being humane."

She was chastised by her colleagues and received 65,000 letters from across the country reprimanding her and calling her an Islamic terrorist supporter. Most of the letters were negative and/or threatening. Her colleagues said she would ruin her career.

Case in point. When the GM of the Houston Rockets spoke up, he spoke as an individual supporting freedom. 

But the NBA? They weren’t as liberal including the biggest NBA Star. The hospital will try to hide it. It’s in their nature bc it’s the bottom line even if it is unethical and sad to hide the truth. It’s the same way with the pedophile priest of the Catholic Church or any church. When you’re on top, ppl change. Corporations are on top.

I wonder if this percentage is the same with leadership across the board. I’m thinking Charlie Rose, Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, President, police officers, etc.

I’m not saying rape, child molesters, abusive cops dealing in drugs are the same. I asking: is (general) perversion of people same across the board whether someone is an actor, comedian, police, priests, pastors, etc.?

EarthPorn,fd090oh,t1_fczbzx5,1578115433.0,My internet search brought up this: They are too big to eat since gators don't chew. Gators typically give way to manatees b/c they are so large. Plus they swim pretty fast 5-15mph and can hold their breathe for 20 minutes. Gators don't want to expend that much energy since they can hardly bite into them and holding them down for 20 minutes is difficult. Note: manatees can also thicken their hide when alarmed making it even harder for a gator to clamp down.

education,fcymxor,t1_f30fq9d,1578083032.0,"I have been thinking of starting my own school. 

Size? 10-15 kids (at first). Age: 15-19. Length? Year around with 3-4 days a week with a start time of 9am to 6pm. Curriculum? Must submit a book for publication (but its okay to to get rejected), reading historical novels and not straight memorization of historical facts, writing a business plan for community projects i.e. cutting grass services for the elderly or painting houses (they figure out labor cost, material cost like gas, lawn mowers, supplies etc). Any payment receive goes to a scholarship for college (or payout once they write up a budget report etc). Alternative projects include video production and music production. 

One problem is: teacher pay. Although I would be the main teacher at first, paying future teachers a healthy wage is an issue. I'd love to pay $45-60K or MORE (avg here is $35-40K). I've read that many countries that perform well academically attract the best talent to become teachers and pay well. To me? If teachers are spending 8hrs a day with kids who will be the future of America, we need to pay more. Plus, if we reduce class sizes from 25-30 to 15, we could create more jobs as well. Then with more role models, maybe we can keep more kids out of trouble (rather than some going to jail). They can jobs and pay taxes. (Note: the cost to house an inmate is $30K/yr.) So if the kid has that job and does not go to jail, they are NET positive by earning $35K and not costing society $30K. That's a NET gain of ""$65K."" 

The other problem is: the state has all these testing standards. But honestly, there are many kids in Louisiana that are simply passed without reaching them anyway b/c teachers are forced willingly and unwillingly to pass them. A school here in May 2019 just passed \~80 students out of rouhgly 150. Those 80 did not pass b/c leadership of the charter school lied about their results.)

Anyway, I've only thought about this for the last year and there are probably a million flaws. Oh well?"
