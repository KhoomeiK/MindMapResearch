When my grandfather died and we were going to the cemetary to bury him, my grandmother joked that ""knowing him, he probably met everyone in here within 15 minutes and has been chatting them up."" We all laughed because we knew how gregarious he could be.

I know it's not necessarily the same for these people, just saying that joking arouning is definitely a thing that happens even for the closest of loved ones."

worldnews,ffmawf2,t1_ffleq1z,1580051580.0,It's a well known urban legend. No one has ever gotten aids that way. I remember this from 90s email forwards.

Its a well known urban legend. Its bullshit, didnt happen and couldnt happen. I cant believe literally 1000 people upvoted that. 

Id love to see a source that this happened because i googled aids toronto rave thumbtack and all i got back was the article saying its a well known hoax and impossible anyways."

AskReddit,ffe3k4z,t1_ffe2vf0,1579835778.0,"Probably.  They seem to literally believe the cheesy decades old propaganda from those countries and think that that makes them ""woke"" bc it's anti-us.  Those countries sucked to live in, at least in the soviet bloc.  It may have been better than the 1800s and it may not be that great now, but it still sucked and was far less free than in the west, as evidenced by the mass celebrations when the berlin wall came down and the ussr collapsed."

The way he acts when we're alone is the fake personality, not the insulting one that comes out later, that's the real one."

When libertarians vote republican, it just supports the thinking that ""libertarians are just republicans who smoke weed"" or ""libertarians are just closeted republicans who are too afraid / ashamed to admit it publically.""

pics,fdsg1rs,t1_fdsdxxm,1578701969.0,"Yeah, and the thing is, it might not be interesting to us at the time, but it *will* be interesting later. E.g. someone might say ""why should I ask about growing up in the 1970s? That was pretty recent, well documented, and we all know how life was then"" but, give it a while and that may change. 

What if it were the 1870s, or 1370s? It'd probably seem much more interesting then. Well, eventually it will have been that long, so get it down while you can."
