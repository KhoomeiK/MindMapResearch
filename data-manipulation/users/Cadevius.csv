introvert,fdbp2mc,t3_ekc5lc,1578259643.0,"We live in a fast world where people don't have much time to stop and think what someone else is thinking and feeling. I think that as introverts we constantly watch and think about what others sometimes dont have time because we stand next to it with a different perspective... Also, I have the impression that couples annoy us sometimes more because even introverts can sometimes feel lonely and a little bit jealous (or that last part may only be about me :s )"
