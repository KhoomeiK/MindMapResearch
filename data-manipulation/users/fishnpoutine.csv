BullTerrier,ffca871,t1_ffc8ciu,1579795060.0,it only lasted few moments and quickly turned to fight club 😄
BullTerrier,ff5scnn,t1_ff59wi5,1579608397.0,uncanny!!!
BullTerrier,ff4zzc3,t1_ff4tpu0,1579576571.0,"We’re a squad of one, Uma is my colleague’s dog. Not sure if between Bowzer, our cat and a parrot  that we can handle more animals... not unless I move somewhere with a lot more land. Two bullies, that’s just asking for trouble 😄"
BullTerrier,ff4qypz,t1_ff4jsfr,1579570324.0,People laugh at my wife when she scoops him at the dog park by the harness (has a hold on the back) and carries him out.
BullTerrier,ff4qvrf,t1_ff4jsfr,1579570269.0,"Bowzer is 30 something pounds now, and I think he has few more to go, but I don’t see him past 35lbs. He is 14 monts now, so I’d say fully grown. Other than the size, not much different than EBT, same desire for self destruction by swallowing foreign object, zoomies, stubbornness etc.
Basically a carry on luggage vs a check-in 😂"
BullTerrier,ff3ul9x,t1_ff3nn1c,1579549186.0,"thank you, I really enjoyed how the motion was frozen with pieces of snow flying upwards"
aww,fdniumz,t1_fdnhrqw,1578586723.0,"You made me picture baby yoda with Bowzer’s hind leg sticking out of his mouth. Luckily, he is now a full size bull terrorist, and to be taken down will require at least as much force, as it was used to take on the mudhorn. I take a baby Yoda sized naps after each walk 😂"
BullTerrier,fdlv13m,t3_ell19e,1578533151.0,still got it
BullTerrier,fdluz12,t3_elrocy,1578533112.0,Loves to try and eat the small ones in the backyard 🙄
Pet_Renaissance,fddpea9,t1_fddp5yb,1578320360.0,from what I’ve read the breed actually started as the miniature kind  (as a ratter dog) and later bred with larger dogs for the standard EBT
Pet_Renaissance,fddggll,t1_fdd6j6f,1578311203.0,he looks like a Bowzer isn’t it?
Pet_Renaissance,fddgfvz,t1_fddahbe,1578311177.0,of the miniature kind 🙌🏻
Pet_Renaissance,fddgf99,t1_fdd5kpw,1578311153.0,"Thank you, the side eye from Bowzer was because he saw me getting up with the phone in my hand, other than that it was totally unscripted"
Pet_Renaissance,fddgbkb,t1_fdd00d3,1578311017.0,"Thank you, I’m very lucky to have them around"
Pet_Renaissance,fddgay0,t1_fdcwvk6,1578310994.0,"thank you, who would have thought I can get so much good content from just watching TV 😄"
Pet_Renaissance,fdcoa6j,t1_fdco6uj,1578279875.0,"same with me every time I look at it, but I’m biased 😄"
BullTerrier,fdbjr3d,t1_fdbjf9t,1578258050.0,"it’s the eyebrows and the wrinkles on the forehead that get most people, especially when he’s begging with the ‘sad’ look"
Pet_Renaissance,fdbibwo,t3_eki6ot,1578257659.0,"Wife was watching tv and our dog Bowzer was in his usual spot - on or around her. With the help of portrait mode and background reading light, it looked very accidentally renaissance."
BullTerrier,fdbgpoy,t1_fdbcgym,1578257187.0,with a pinch of tazmanian devil in short bursts
BullTerrier,fdbggca,t1_fdbe7tw,1578257142.0,or the universal side eye 😄

BullTerrier,fcv1yn0,t1_fcv1ojr,1577992966.0,"don’t let him fool you, he is a regular bull terrorist 😄"
cats,fckoko6,t1_fckmk65,1577729818.0,long lost twin 😄
cats,fck4wtr,t1_fck2fzv,1577716690.0,"Yes, first we walked the neighborhood to look for signs, then we went the city animal’s hospital, where we posted her as found and were told to wait 7 days before keeping her or giving her for adoption.  We decided to wait 10 days before bringing her to the vet to get her chipped and rest is history. She was 8-10 weeks when we found her, in a windchill advisory day with kneehigh snowbanks, she managed to find some refuge in the bag of our lawnmower, one more day out, I’d recon she wouldn’t be so lucky to survive..."
cats,fcjxrnu,t1_fcjx97t,1577709683.0,"I posted baby vs full grown photo a while back, check it out on my profile"
cats,fcjw6dr,t1_fcjto2c,1577707677.0,"Tabby/coon mix I assume? When we took her to get chipped the doc wrote domestic mix, so can’t say really. She has ginger on her back, legs are tabby, stomach and chin almost white... a bit of everything 😄"
cats,fcjw3i1,t1_fcjrkyi,1577707570.0,"hehe,love it! I was installing a Yeti microphone for my wife when I saw the tracks and there was a cold weather alert that day with a lot of snow, Yeti seemed fitting for a name 😄"
cats,fcjvz3s,t1_fcjm0fx,1577707406.0,"Thank you,  I’ve tried to get them all together but it’s not easy. The bird wants to attack both cat and dog as she is the boss of the house, so things always get out of hand 😄"
cats,fcjvpcf,t1_fcjjn8r,1577707038.0,"she got me good, I tell ya 😄"
cats,fcjvglx,t1_fcj9sgt,1577706705.0,I was installing a Yeti microphone in my wife’s office and saw the tracks in the snow outside through the window. Rest is history 😄
