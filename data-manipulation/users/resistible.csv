I can tell you, for a fact, that my middle child has cried as a manipulation, and my 3 year old sometimes cries simply because her older sister is crying and laughs at jokes she wasn't even in the room for because her older sister is laughing. I'm not sure how many kids you have, but distracting kids from tantrums is totally different than if they have a legitimate reason to be crying. It's not always my role to put my kids first -- sometimes I need to put my wife first, and make sure that she's doing ok, too.

This is compounded by sometimes being put in a situation where she doesn't -- and shouldn't -- get to choose. She doesn't get to have candy instead of vegetables. That's a simple one at home; the tantrum to get candy earns her a time out. But what would I do at a restaurant? I have to prevent the tantrum somehow. That would be where this lpt comes in."

The pick up doesn't have a legal obligation to exceed the speed limit to pass, and given the extreme nature of the Camaro's behavior, slowing down may have saved his life when the Camaro went full stupid.  What's the correct legal response when someone is driving like the Camaro is?  It isn't speeding or an unsafe lane change.  I didn't see a brake check.  So I have a difficult time laying blame on the pick up."
