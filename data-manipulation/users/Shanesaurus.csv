The punishment imposed by the school may have been harsh but that's what your son got and that's what he has to live with. It's an important lesson in life. Now you've used your influence to get him a ""lesser sentence"" and that sets a very bad example. That fact that your son is bragging about ""getting away"" with it clearly shows that he has not learned from this experience.
You have done your son a disservice. I hope you are able to recover this in some way."
