todayilearned,fehofth,t1_fehnb2s,1579120666.0,I think it will be okay to just call those people delusional openly. Unless they’re suggesting some invisible noodly appendage is holding us all to the Earth’s surface. Hmmm...
todayilearned,fehnoq7,t1_fehkeeq,1579120232.0,I don’t understand the shoes. I don’t know that I ever will.
bloodborne,fef4gu2,t1_feesrg9,1579047958.0,"Perhaps bake a cake for your neighbors with frosting that reads: ""I don't hate the Romany people and I haven't killed any gypsies.""

That will naturally clear things up."

UpliftingNews,fdyj0ks,t1_fdxfroc,1578780290.0,What do you mean you can’t work another shift? Tom got a switch installed in his brain that pushes his body into survival mode and he is killing it.
CrohnsDisease,fdwboa0,t1_fdw5h4t,1578757082.0,"On the bright side, that’s a party trick in some circles. Perhaps not the circles you’re looking to party with but at least someone out there appreciated our talents."
OSHA,fdpzsxy,t3_emg3r7,1578647807.0,I know what you mean. That drop off is too high. He could really injure himself falling off of that.
britishproblems,fcrcaqt,t1_fcp99ry,1577899902.0,I wish I had as much fight and spirits in me as you brits on any given Thursday. I do not wish to have as much fight and spirits in me as you on New Years. You folks take it to a new level and the rest of us just have to stand in awe of y’all.
masseffect,fc5rv53,t1_fc32v8h,1577464495.0,"In ME3 there is a quest that relies on you having collected ten of the matriarchs writing’s, acquired the elkoss combine license, completed the quest involving Rita at chora’s den, and grabbing the research for Gavin Hossle on Feros all in ME1. 

It’s my favorite quest in the game because it rewards doing all the random side quests and being thorough. Enjoy the +5 readiness rating! Don’t think you need to collect materials for anything except for the bonus materials it gives you in ME2 as a result."
