selfimprovement,ffdry4g,t1_ffdo6o7,1579827444.0,"I would focus on trying to get more or better sleep. Sleep would far exceed any nootropics benefit for the research that is out there. People who were sleep deprived and took a test thought they did 60% better than they actually did, which comes back to my point of you cannot base your effectiveness on your own observation (it's flawed).

I don't do nootropics because a neurologist friend of mine showed me studies of scans of people who took nootropics and people that didn't and they showed decreased productivity after the use of nootropics so they amount they got ahead whilst on the drug was negated by the downtime needed. ie. What goes up must come down

For every Dave Asprey there is just a deluded f-wit who uses his argument to sell shitty products and books. He has no real scientific evidence behind him, just his 'theory' or self-observed evidence which in research is considered they worst and most unreliable method of testing theories. 

Look at Tony Robins, 500M (compared to Daves 24M) tony uses scientific backed research like exercise, meditation, diet to hack his body naturally. He is more effective (arguably) was able to do it without smart drugs, like countless other people that you would consider successful. 

In my opinion smart drugs are like the vitamine and suppliments industry, unregulated and probably don't have that much of an effect. All the literature says you can gain the same effects from a balanced diet and exercise. I would rather not be a lab test, but each to their own."
selfimprovement,ffdlbm0,t3_et11ei,1579823309.0,"I would argue, and this is based on my research. That if you use Nootropics as a means of learning it will become a dependance. You will start to convince your self you can't study or be smart without them. My contention with them is that it only gives a perceived improvement, people are the worst evaluators of their own performance. The other argument is that if nootropics did increase performance exponentially it would be implemented into ever fortune-500 company in an instant. 

The science says they don't know enough about recreational nootropics uses long-term effects if you don't actually need the drugs to treat an existing problem. However there are results that say it can (and I stress can not will) increase performance. Genetic Intelligence would far surpass any nootropic and that is a proven fact. 

You don't need nootropics to self improve, mindset far exceed any drug."

We have an ego for a reason. The point is we can't help but judge foreign entities, but we can control how we use the information. Ie.

socialskills,fej4fxz,t3_epei2f,1579156522.0,"Your's not going to like the answer, but you're self centred; literally. You need to actively listen, I know people throw that term around a lot but what it means is don't hold thoughts or arguments when you hear something to comment or object to, just listen. Anxiety drives us inwards, compassion pushes us outwards. 

If you get nervous or anxious that you won't have anything to say, relax. Nobody expects you to entertain like Truman Capote, people just want to be heard to know someone cares. Read about the news or current events something everyone might know or have seen. Give your insight after the other person or build off what they said.

If you want to be more open, you need to be mindful of your state of mind and this interconnects with active listening. If you are already thinking about what you are going to say, then your mind isn't open, it's fixed on what you have to say. I can honestly say the only way to be more open is shutting up and accepting what people have to say. You can be objectionable but  you must be rational.

I learn't this from a management journal but the best way to defuse tension is to make someones voice heard. So say something like ""I can see this means a lot to you, what do you want me or us to know?"" unobjectionable and acknowledges that you can see they want something to be heard."

Unless someone witnesses you doing it often or constantly in a situation you can't fix it until you find a trigger or situation. 

As an ex actor I can tell you they could possibly be right, but you're just not aware of doing it since it's might be natural. Try to isolate the situations where it happens and keep attention to your eye movements and you might be able to pinpoint if or when you do it. Only after that can you actually try to change it and it takes months to break habits. Possibly video your face and have a conversation with someone (try to forget the camera is there), then you might capture when and why it happens."

socialskills,fe5d8du,t3_enu411,1578867958.0,"Humans are all the same, however we value others to be inferior or superior based on traits or attributes we deem as socially important or desirable. In knowing this, each individual gives different values to things (I like Ferrari's but you don't see the value in buying nice cars) or groupthink which tends to be the latter (Everyone hates brussel sprouts so I hate them too). Don't think of anyone as better or worse (especially in high school) because immediately all your confidence leaves because now you have made your self inferior to them for no reason. Don't try to prove your self, what you have to offer (yourself) should be enough and if it isn't they aren't worth your time. Relax, people like authenticity be yourself and people will notice. You go into these interactions with too much expectation and already prejudge the situation before it happens (ie. they won't like me, they think I'm lame).

Go into the conversations with no expectations (what ever happens, happens), listen to what they have to say and ask questions about them(people like talking about themselves). Be confident, shoulders relaxed and back, stand firm and straight, make eye contact (More eye-contact for women, a little less for men). Speak with a strong clear voice (what you have to say is important).

We crave intimacy as humans, it's a biological nature to continue survival as a species. Don't become a pessimist about all people, there are good people out there, you need to test people before you invest to much, I like to forget my wallet at lunch, if they make a huge fuss about it or bitch about it for weeks after, they show their true self to you.
