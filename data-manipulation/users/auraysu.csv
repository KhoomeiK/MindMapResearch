The hardest part is that I humanize an abuser, not demonize him. My support network doesn't understand why I think he is a good person or why I struggle with guilt for lashing out in the end.

But you got to let go of toxic people in your life. It's hard, especially when you care enough about someone that you just want to keep forgiving them but sometimes you just got to... let go, especially when there's no bridge left to fix. By no means does this mean he is inherently a toxic person- I can freely admit I was toxic in the relationship as well. But our actions and choices afterwards coming out of it reflects on the type of person we are. 

As another ex has said- you don't stop loving someone, it's not a switch you can flip. I'm not ashamed to say I still love him, but romantic =/= unconditional love. Staying in that toxic relationship was definitely my biggest fuckup, but it doesn't define what my life can be from here on out."

I've been reminiscing a lot because most of what happened happened around this time a year ago.  I was put through hell and I cracked after the last straw and lashed out. I was eaten by guilt for the longest time.

I've started treating myself more kindly and reminding myself that my reaction didn't come from nowhere. It's generally not a good idea to be stuck in the past, but affirming to myself how he abused me has helped me stop punishing myself for reacting to his abuse. 

I still believe he's a good person. My friends beg to differ, but what one said really stuck- ""It doesn't matter if he's a good person or not- it doesn't change that he treated *you* poorly"". It allows me to uphold the belief that he can learn from what happened and grow and be happy, but that the pain I felt over what he did to me is also valid.

I know it's hard, but you need to get out of it. Your relationship shows signs of emotional abuse.

Your story sounds somewhat similar to mine. I took my ex back 11 times. I understand what you mean when you say her raping you doesn't upset you- my ex got me drunk and took advantage of me and yet I was too blinded by love for it to upset me either. I stayed with him through ""I used you for sex"" and breaking up with me 30 minutes before our 1 year anniversary. I went down the path you are on and it left me broken and hurt. I advise you to step off of it while you can.

Consent is important. If you tell her to get off or stop and she doesn't stop, that's rape.

Love is blind, OP. I genuinely felt like my ex loved me and he was handsome, funny- everything. And he really might have loved me. But relationships don't run on love by itself. It runs on communication, respect, and trust. Do you ever notice that she's the one who decides whether you're in the relationship or not? She leaves because she isn't getting something from you, and comes back because she lost a source of validation and affection. That's not healthy because in the meanwhile, you're getting hurt over being abandoned over and over again. You lose your sense of self because you willingly take back someone who's hurting you because you love them and they're taking advantage of that.

She broke a fundamental trust by engaging in infidelity. The act of leaving and coming back over and over is abusive and manipulative. Cold shouldering you and leaving when you say you don't want to have sex is a way for her to manipulate you into doing what she wants you to do; an ultimatum of ""have sex with me or we break up"".

Block her. Build a support network and seek counseling, because it seems like you're trauma bonded. Since you said last year was when you first started dating, I'm assuming you're a college freshman, if you chose to pursue higher education. Use the dating violence / abuse resource center at your university, it should already be paid for by tuition.

I also had someone who loved me very much. She was my friend for 14 years, and we were like sisters. Could communicate through just looks- that type of close. Only registers to me that she exists when we occasionally text or see snap stories.

It sounds like you both are codependent. You shouldn't let him being the sweetest man when he's ok be a reason to sweep verbally abusing you under the rug. Normal relationships shouldn't have such steep highs and lows.

It's reminiscent of the cycle of abuse- you fight and he hurts you (in this case, telling you to kill yourself or that you're fat and ugly and no one would want you), then a honeymoon phase where there's lots of love and everything goes smoothly. You should also possibly consider why you would talk about cheating to your friend, yet say you want to spend the rest of your life with him- or the ramifications of how his cheating has affected you in the past 2 years. 

I don't mean to be harsh. I know that when you love someone you want to keep trying. But it sounds like there are persisting issues that aren't addressed or solved, and trust getting broken over the course of your relationship takes a *long* time to come back. 

Imagine both of you are in a car. The car has been through potholes, accidents, speeding, the whole jazz. It's banged up. Either you pull over and get the car to a repair shop, or you keep going and going until it crashes. Silly analogy but- I think you should have a very serious talk with your partner on how your relationship is going and get couples counseling, or consider the possibility of leaving."

I was pretty close to a friend I had for around 9 years. I rarely think about her unless her name pops up and while I really like her, I haven't really followed up on any plans to meet her over break. 

I also had someone who loved me very much. She was my friend for 14 years, and we were like sisters. Could communicate through just looks- that type of close. Only registers to me that she exists when we occasionally text or see snap stories.

It's all about time and proximity, friend. Once you lose contact, people start to slip from your mind because you're busy."

offmychest,fcc46b0,t3_eh1ali,1577594211.0,"I'm sorry OP. I think this relationship is toxic.

It sounds like you both are codependent. You shouldn't let him being the sweetest man when he's ok be a reason to sweep verbally abusing you under the rug. Normal relationships shouldn't have such steep highs and lows.

It's reminiscent of the cycle of abuse- you fight and he hurts you (in this case, telling you to kill yourself or that you're fat and ugly and no one would want you), then a honeymoon phase where there's lots of love and everything goes smoothly. You should also possibly consider why you would talk about cheating to your friend, yet say you want to spend the rest of your life with him- or the ramifications of how his cheating has affected you in the past 2 years. 

I don't mean to be harsh. I know that when you love someone you want to keep trying. But it sounds like there are persisting issues that aren't addressed or solved, and trust getting broken over the course of your relationship takes a *long* time to come back. 

Imagine both of you are in a car. The car has been through potholes, accidents, speeding, the whole jazz. It's banged up. Either you pull over and get the car to a repair shop, or you keep going and going until it crashes. Silly analogy but- I think you should have a very serious talk with your partner on how your relationship is going and get couples counseling, or consider the possibility of leaving."

offmychest,fc0zrrf,t3_efeyy1,1577304166.0,"Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear that. But as someone who had played it out before, tried seeing it out for the long run, I can say that trust doesn't come back.

My ex didn't cheat on me, but he broke my trust pretty badly. He told me about how he held another girl the way he was holding me, how he was jealous when she had sex with someone else; that he didn't like how I looked and found other girls so attractive they blew him away. There's more of course, but the big and dirty is that he told me he used me for sex and got me drunk and had sex with me. 

I can relate when you talk about how if you were an outsider, you would tell yourself to get out but you just love her so much that you don't want to leave. I felt the same. ""We had something so good, he's worth it."" or ""I love him so much and he loves me, if I just wait it out, we can go back to being happy"" or ""Why am I so insecure, he loves me and I should just suck it up"". But your feelings are **valid** and you should remember that.

I dealt with insecurity and the pain of wondering if I was a replacement, if he thought about the other girls he mentioned when he was with me. For over a year. I hated who I was with him. I was insecure and bitter by the end of it after holding out for so long. I lashed out. I don't want the same to happen to you.

My reply is long and I'm not trying to make it about me. The amount of detail I'm going into is to hope that a long read can save you some future heartbreak. I want you to understand that once your foundation for trust is broken, it's gone. It takes a lot of time and effort to rebuild because trust shouldn't be given, it should be earned. My ex only talked about his feelings for other girls and I could barely stomach letting him hold me for a good couple months. Coming back from cheating is going to be a lot harder. The insecurity builds. Once you lose trust, it's hard to believe whatever they say to you. ""I love you, only you"" loses meaning. 

My advice is- leave. If you're actually adamant on staying with her, I won't blame you. But you need to communicate with her. Go to infidelity counseling. Take some time to ruminate and seek counseling to sort out your feelings."
AskReddit,fc02jxe,t3_efe5rt,1577275339.0,"Friends. It's nice being able to spend two whole days together and feel completely at ease with them.

I feel appreciated, you know? Little comments on how they like my music or that they think I'm cool or enjoy hanging out with me or treating me to food. They're great. 

A physical gift, however? Amazon gift card, somehow! Among the clothes and trinkets, I think giving me the freedom to pick what I want is refreshing."
