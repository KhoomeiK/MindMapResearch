The main factor being government guaranteed debt for a non-collateralized asset (the bank can't ""take"" away your degree, because it has no intrinsic value, like a car or house does).  

Since student debt can't be discharged in bankruptcy, colleges know they are 100% going to be paid in full for each student.  Basic economics tells us that this means prices will increase (which we have seen they have, far outpacing inflation).  By cancelling debt, this will only exacerbate the current problem.  More student debt, and higher prices.

Free college is a similar problem.  Since you can't fix prices without seeing a reduction in quality of the product, colleges will only be forced to raise prices knowing that they full-well will get paid 100% tuition by each enrolling student - the payer in this case being the government and not the student.
