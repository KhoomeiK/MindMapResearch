dogs,ffbqelc,t3_esrkmf,1579778492.0,"When my dog had a surgery, the vet intentionally left the iv catheter in. It was removed the day after the surgery. So, I think it should be fine to wait for your vet to open if it doesn't bother your dog."

AskCulinary,fesl8zi,t1_fejejn2,1579366398.0,"I've tried the rice cooker. I cooked 2 cups of jasmine white rice with probably 2.2-2.4 cups of water (I did not measure this) in a 1 litre cooker. It didn't have the problem that your rice cooker does. It could be too much rice (unlikely with only 1 cup in a 1 litre cooker), too much water, problem with steam vent or something else. I've looked around and it seems some solutions are to wash the rice 3-4 times (I find that unnecessary with brown rice as brown rice doesn't make the water as starchy as white rice, once or twice is usually enough.), soak the rice for 30 minutes before cooking, place the lid slightly ajar so the steam has somewhere to go, or thinly brush the top of the inner pot with oil. I have no idea if these ""solutions"" will help, though."

dogs,femgxqy,t3_epx9in,1579254959.0,"About half a year ago, my dog, who was almost 12 years old at the time, got a mastectomy. She got tests done prior to the surgery: x-rays, EKG, complete bloodwork (I can't remember if there's anything else). The surgery went well. Right after the surgery, she looked a bit confused but I think she was more angry at me than confused because she was hungry and thristy. Lol.

About a year before that, she had a surgery to remove a lump on her front leg. After the surgery, she developed tracheobronchitis which resolved after some time. But it was so scary and I was a nervous wreck for a while. After that, I think she became happier than before the surgery.

She is a small dog, though, so her being 12 years old is considered younger than a large dog being 12 years old  (I hope this sentence makes sense).

If you're not sure which option to choose, maybe a third opinion is a good idea. Good luck."

AskCulinary,fejdzu5,t3_eph992,1579169424.0,"Too much rice and water for the rice cooker, perhaps? Or the water boils too rapidly. I don't think I've used that kind of rice cooker so I can't say for sure. I think we have one similar to yours (different brand) so maybe I'll try it. I'll report back if I get to try it to see if it does the same thing."
dogs,fedtoag,t3_eomrod,1579019662.0,"One of my brother's ex got a puppy probably because she saw we had dogs and wanted one. Within a couple of weeks, the pup was gone. I don't know if she gave it to one of her family members or she rehomed him.

One of my neighbours recently got a pup. I'm hoping they are responsible dog owners. So far so good. But I'm not sure about when the pup is fully grown because it looks like he's gonna be a big boy."

dogs,fed287n,t3_eofho3,1578995064.0,"I don't but at least two of my neighbours do. They make the food everyday, I think. Neighbour#1's dogs seem to be healthy. I believe they also feed their dogs kibbles occasionally. Neighbour#2's dog has quite a bit of health problems especially with her skin. The dog's skin has improved since she started eating kibbles. Feeding homemade food is totally fine. But it is wise to consult with professionals.

I do make my dogs' treats, though. I usually make a batch that will last about a couple of weeks. I put the treats in an air tight container and put it in the fridge. The only treat I freeze is roasted sweet potato. The sweet potatoes are so good frozen, too. At this point, I'm not sure if the sweet potato is the dogs' treat or mine."

1 cup of Purina One Indoor Advantage contains 372 kcal. I don't know which canned food you're giving him but let's just say it's the Fancy Feast Classic Paté Chicken which is 99 kcal per can.

I googled a calorie calculator for cats (no idea how accurate that is) and with 14 lbs being his ideal weight, at 19lbs he is about 35% overweight. The recommended recommended daily calorie intake for a 14lb cat is 282 kcal. So, with 1 can of wet food (99 kcal) + 3/4 cups dry food (279 kcal), your cat is eating about 378 kcal a day excluding treats, if any. On the days that he gets 1/2 cup dry food + 1 can wet food, his calorie intake is 186+99 = 285 kcal per day which is about right for his ideal weight.

The numbers mentioned is just a guideline, all cats are different. But be sure to NOT underfeed him to get him to lose weight quickly. Consult your vet for a safe weight loss rate for your cat. Check the label of his food for calorie contents of each food and adjust accordingly. It'll take time for him to lose those weight, don't rush it.

Edit to say: Loki looks so adorable!"
dogs,fcy3n3x,t3_ejikix,1578074347.0,"No, it's not normal. Depending on the size of the dog and the dog's drinking habit, ""several pints of water"" may be too much, too little or about right. If the dog doesn't drink enough water on his own, this could be a way to get him to drink. But water intoxication is also a thing so the owner should be mindful on how much water she's forcing her dog to drink."
dogs,fcwveyl,t3_ejc43h,1578039237.0,"I don't know much regarding dog training but that pinch collar sounds awful, especially on a puppy. Have you considered changing to a different trainer who uses different training techniques (e.g. positive reinforcement)? I don't know if this is true but I've observed that trainers who have that many years of experience often use the outdated training techniques (pain, punishment, etc.) Obviously, I don't have the experience to say what is good or bad but maybe this trainer's technique is not right for your dog. He's still a puppy and nipping is totally normal. But do not let him nip too hard or it'll turn into a problem more serious than it already is. And why is he tied up outside from the afternoon until sunset? How many hours is that exactly?"

dogs,fctqk4s,t3_eiorak,1577954368.0,"One of my dogs has never had tear stains before I changed his food (I do this occasionally) a little over a month ago. I asked his regular vet and vet said his eyes were dry due to low humidity. When I took him to another place for a full check-up, vet asked basic information like what food he's on, etc. I then mentioned to the vet that he has never had the tear stains until recently. Vet immediately asked if it started to happen when his food was changed. I said yes. He said it could be the food. He asked if I was gonna change his food again after this bag is finished, I said I was definitely considering it. I'm waiting to see if it goes away once I changed his food.

That said, every dog is different. It's best to consult your vet as the cause of your dog's tear stains could be something else other than the food."
