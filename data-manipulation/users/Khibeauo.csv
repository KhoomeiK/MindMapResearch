Autoflowers,ff5frhx,t3_erobej,1579590933.0,"Usually autos start flowering around 30-40 days. I'd think it should start flowering soon.   


Sometimes, though, some 'auto-flowering seeds' turn out to be photo.   
This happens when the breeder didn't stabilize the phenotype of the strain.   
I'd suggest to wait for another week or two to veg out.   
Then if it still doesn't flower, you can try growing it as a photo."

composting,ff2g4sn,t3_er2ub1,1579504685.0,"I think that larvae is BSF (Black Soldier Fly) and they are composters' friend.   
They compost raw material way faster than worms.   
My kitchen scraps vanish over night!   


People say BSF casting is not as ideal as worm casting.   
However, worms LOVE composting it.   
So it would be a good idea to have a good balance of BSF and worms in your compost.   


Also, it should be noted BSF multiply VERY vigorously and your compost may look SERIOUSLY GROSS until you get used to it. So if it's not your ideal, you might want to put a mulch on top of compost to prevent adult flies to lay eggs. Or, if it's getting out of control, spread compost and let birds have at them. Birds LOVE BSF larvae. 

DR: BSF is a great composter and they don't bite nor spread disease so it's ok to have them in compost. (But it could make your pile look mildly gross)"

MephHeads,fdttatc,t3_emzwco,1578721863.0,"Buds don’t produce nutrients. Leaves do. 
So if you want to concentrate nutes towards buds, I’d cut off shaded and undeveloped bud sites at the bottom of the plants. 

Fan leaves also save buds when water/nute deficiency happens. If there are no fan leaves the symptoms go straight to buds. ( which nobody wants)

Yellowed and dried up leaves at the bottom can be pulled off later on during heavy flowering so if I were you, id just prune undeveloped bud sites while leaving the leaves as much as possible. And I do not worry about fan leaves covering buds as ling as the leaves around the buds are not completely shaded. 

If leaves are stacking atop of each other, LST it and speead the leaves out."
