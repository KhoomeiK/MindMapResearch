adventuregames,fedyijp,t1_fecs546,1579022581.0,"I've heard that in Secret of Monkey Island, if you stay underwater for more than ten minutes (the length of time Guybrush boasts to be able to hold his breath), you'll die. But I've never actually tested it. There's only one puzzle underwater and it seems unlikely that anyone would end up dying there."
