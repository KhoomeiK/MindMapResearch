There's always rumours that you can sell your high karma Reddit accounts to marketers or whatever, but honest to God I hardly recognize any Reddit usernames outside of a few, much less bother to check if they have high karma. Karma hardly works to make an account more reputable as a sales tactic.

Honestly speaking, I'm more likely to suspect someone's a bot or shill if they have suspiciously high karma, even if the account is old. I imagine an account with more substantive posts, and lower karma, will be more attractive for sale, because it seems more ""authentic"".

Written language is the ""most efficient"" (actually arguably not so, since aren't YouTube/Instagram stories/visual+audio mediums fast becoming \*the\* main way of consuming content online?) method of communicating today \*because\* our society has co-evolved alongside it for centuries, producing technology that further allowed us to disseminate our written language.

Who knows? Perhaps in an alternate timeline, the Australian aboriginals would have be sufficient war loving and jingoistic enough to conquer parts of the world, propagating their use of orally transmitted legends to transfer knowledge. Their technology would have been developed to further enhance the use of the spoken word, at the expense of writing tech.

Personally, my mood and anxiety levels were pretty labile at the start of treatment, but it seemed to even out as treatment progressed. My doctor always emphasized looking at the bigger, positive picture when it comes to times like this.

Instead of evaluating my well-being on a per day basis, he advised to take a wider timeframe of a week: had you have roughly more good/tolerable days this week versus last week, for example? Like I said in my first reply to your post, the fact that you see improvements so fast means that TMS works for you, so that's great news :)

Try not to stress over the minutiae of your mood. I know it's hard, especially when money is tight, and there is a lot of expectation riding on the treatment! The anxiety that comes about with fretting doesnt help, so if you do end up having another bad day, just allow yourself to mope, or cry, but try not to worry about it after the fact, or attach too much meaning to it.

From the vantage point of evolution, we might be hardwired to mistrust others because a negative bias serves survival. Yet, for an intensely social species such as ours, being constantly on guard doesn’t bode well. How, then, do we trust, cooperate and connect with other people while also protecting ourselves from the threat that they might pose?

> The theory of natural pedagogy, [proposed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3049090/) in 2011 by Gergely Csibra and György Gergely, professors of cognitive science at the Central European University in Budapest, suggests an answer. In this view, evolution has engineered a nifty mechanism to relax our natural vigilance so that we can learn from others. To recognise relevant and trustworthy sources of information, we rely on certain visual and verbal cues or signals. In childhood, [writes](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-14624-001) Fonagy in 2014, these cues are the same ones that underlie secure attachment (the special vocalisations of “motherese”, for example). Babies, in other words, are primed to trust the sensitive caregiver, who, in turn, teaches them how to trust others and navigate their social world. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19489901) from Harvard University in 2009 shows that securely attached children are discerning judges of credibility – they trust mum when she is being reasonable but go with their own judgments when her statements run against reality. Their security in themselves and others turns these kids into adults open to new information, comfortable with uncertainty and flexible with changing their views in light of new data.
> 
> The chief value of psychotherapy, he says, lies in its potential to rekindle our epistemic trust
> 
> The opposite holds for the insecurely attached. Anxious people tend to distort social cues and exaggerate threats, and this can mislead them into seeing their partners as unreliable, unsupportive or uninterested. Avoidant people focus on protecting themselves, which can make them cling to negative stereotypes of others in the face of ample evidence to the contrary. For example, Mikulincer’s [study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-12431-002) in 2003 had married couples rate their partner’s behaviour over the course of three weeks. While anxious people gave higher ratings when their spouses were objectively more supportive, avoidant people completely failed to register positive changes in their partners.
> 
> Insecure attachment, it appears, perpetuates our natural suspicion, keeping us closed off and unreceptive to socially relevant information. Fonagy calls this “epistemic mistrust”, and for him it might be the common denominator of many mental-health problems, explaining their severity and persistence. The chief value of psychotherapy, he says, lies in its potential to rekindle our epistemic trust and jumpstart our ability to learn from others in our social environment. By restoring attachment security, therapy lowers our social vigilance and opens us to trusting one person – the therapist – which eventually allows us to go out into the world and trust other people. The importance of this recognition is such that even in CBT sessions, when therapists are bombarded by clients’ upset feelings, they will temporarily shift their usual agenda or stance to empathise with the feeling state, and then shift back to emphasising cognitive themes and the rational control of emotional experience.
> 
> The restoration of secure attachment is what happened with Cora, too. In her last sessions, she realised that she wasn’t actually alone. She had a friend she could count on, and a sister who shared her childhood memories. It wasn’t that these people were absent before; she just wasn’t seeing them, or perhaps not trusting what was right in front of her. But her growing trust – first in the therapist, then in the goodwill of the world and her own ability to navigate it – allowed her to see others “more as opportunities for social contact, rather than threats”. Cora was by no means cured by her therapy: her trauma ran too deep. But she was saved. She was ready to live and to keep healing.

It sounds like you only read to the (early) middle portion, and gave up when you thought it was making a statement about gender politics. This is the last section of the article, and if you reread it without prejudice again, you might notice that the bulk of the article relates to thr client-therapist relationship, and in particular, ""Cora's"". When they mention the care that infants receive from their mothers, it is **in relation to how the therapist-client relationship seems to emulate it,** and it always returns to find it evidenced in observations of Cora's interactions with her therapist.

In addition, you didn't address the point that (backward as it is), mothers still are the main childcare providers of a good majority of children in the early years, so unfortunately the theorists they quote (descriptively, and it would be bad faith to say that they are pushing an agenda to unfairly shame mothers) revert to the gendered terms. Also, the byline, and throughout the article, does use the gender neutral term ""caregiver"", especially when **they were not quoting or paraphrasing childhood development psychologists.**

I see that you mentioned that you want to improve your listening and speaking skills.

If we are talking strictly about kanji characters, there's such a thing as 和製漢字, that is, kanji characters that originated from Japan, not China. A common enough character that doesn't exist in Chinese is 働, see wikipedia's [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji#Kokuji) for a short list of other examples. Interestingly, 畑 has been adopted into Chinese from Japanese, but is only used in Japanese surnames. Japan wasn't the only country to create its own ""Chinese"" characters; Korea and Vietnam have also have their [gukja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja#Gukja) and [chunom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BB%AF_N%C3%B4m#Locally_invented_characters) respectively.

If we are talking about kanji compound words, then no, there are lots of kanji compounds that make no sense in modern day Chinese: some may have been derived from Classical Chinese, and diverged from there, others were just Japanese innovations.

Tell a person who won a prize that everyone else won something better and they'll stop being so happy. Tell someone who lost that everyone else lost and they might stop feeling as sad. They're simplistic examples, but they highlight the similarities between happiness and sadness. Only difference is we want one and not the other, usually. So your analogy is flawed: sometimes you really can't be happy if someone else has it better than you.

Happiness and sadness isn't a zero sum game or a competition, and it is not necessary even in your given example for the individual in question to compare their losses/gains to gain any kind of gratification or disappointment. 

I mean, sure, a new father could be happy because his newborn has the bluest eyes in the hospital nursery, or a new groom could be happy because he *thinks* he has the *hottest* wife among his friends, but I think everyone can agree that these are very **immature** and **superficial** sorts of ""happiness"" that are rooted in feelings of superiority over others. 

I think this is a mindset that everyone kind of struggles with to grow out of, and I guess some people never really do. It is really counter productive to think this way, because comparisons are always subjective (nothing is black and white)."
