> **The most prolific I.R.A. efforts on Facebook and Instagram specifically targeted black American communities** and appear to have been focused on developing black audiences and recruiting black Americans as assets,” the report says. Using Gmail accounts with American-sounding names, the Russians recruited and sometimes paid unwitting American activists of all races to stage rallies and spread content, but **there was a disproportionate pursuit of African-Americans, it concludes**.


> The report says that while “other distinct ethnic and religious groups were the focus of one or two Facebook Pages or Instagram accounts, the black community was targeted extensively with dozens.” In some cases, Facebook ads were targeted at users who had shown interest in particular topics, including black history, the Black Panther Party and Malcolm X. The most popular of the Russian Instagram accounts was @blackstagram, with 303,663 followers.

> The Internet Research Agency also created a dozen websites disguised as African-American in origin, with names like blackmattersus.com, blacktivist.info, blacktolive.org and blacksoul.us. **On YouTube, the largest share of Russian material covered the Black Lives Matter movement and police brutality, with channels called “Don’t Shoot” and “BlackToLive.”**"

If you watched that movie and were unable to pick up in the partisan hyperbole it's not a small wonder that shithole of a country elects reality TV game show hosts as leaders. 

It's okay to call out hyperbole and hysteria when it comes from the left. In fact not doing so is perhaps the main reason Trump gains support. It's ironic that the people who oppose him with such blatant over the top hysterical hyperbole are the reason he succeeds at all."
movies,fgfgqh4,t1_fgefnzg,1580738261.0,"Trump is a moronic idiot. That doesn't  mean the hysteria by anti-Trump zealots isn't likewise idiotic.

Take your Big Mac comment. When winning teams visit the Whitehouse they are aren't given a meal, Trump thought it'd be fun to order in a bunch of hamburgers and milkshakes for the university kids. 

Had Obama done the exact same thing it would be celebrated by the people condemning it."
movies,fgd5ylk,t1_fgd3qps,1580679273.0,"Yes that's my point. It's presents Fox News in such a comically hyperbolic way at times that it reminds me of how the idiots on the right would present CNN in a movie. 

In my opinion the film boils down to essentially just a propaganda piece for hysterical Woke anti-Trump zealots."
movies,fgctmwg,t1_fgc3f90,1580676135.0,"Agreed. 

Bombshell was akin to watching a movie about CNN made by Donald Trump, Steve Bannon and Alex Jones. I was actually embarrassed at times at how really bad it was. 

That said, the prosthetic and make up work on Charlize was flawless. I am curious they did a little post production work on her voice as well."

movies,fg7kale,t3_exbe03,1580594576.0,"Or even better let the T-1000 have a son that would save humanity but build the suspense by not revealing him and have Sarah Conner keep referencing ""the T-1000 son"" throughout the first two acts so the audience totally expects to see his son. . 

Then **BOOM** in the final act reveal that it was actually his DAUGHTER all along not a male son!!!! 

Holy. Shit. Balls! Can you even imagine how cool that would be?"

Mahershala Ali won for 10 minutes in Moonlight and Ann Hathaway and Judi Dench probably clocked even less for their Oscar wins. 

Although Hopkins was for Best Actor and I think the other three were Supporting wins. I suppose he had more unique and distinct scenes."
