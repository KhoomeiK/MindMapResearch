I switched from slices/cuts of cheese to cottage cheese. Cottage Cheese has something like 15g of protein per serving, and each 1/2 cup is ~110 calories). Swapping in cottage cheese killed any hunger I was experiencing and it has less calories than the other cheeses I was eating, and gives me more volume."

Tobacco is behind the counter (alcohol in the fridges), but since (at least here in most states in the USA) you only have to be 18+ to get it, whereas alcohol is 21+. I would say you're more likely to not be carded for tobacco than alcohol. Alcohol typically carries much stiffer penalties when you sell to a minor so they practically card everyone who tries to buy it. Just to give you an idea, in Colorado I believe its just a $200 fine selling tobacco to a minor, whereas Alcohol carries a $5000+ fine."

Outside of pulling liquor from your parents liquor cabinet, it was (and still is) much easier to get tobacco products. My comment about gas stations wasn't to say that they don't card, but when I was growing up you had friends who worked at gas stations, a lot of high schoolers looked 18 (they didn't have as many carding campaigns in the 90's/early 2000's, and kids turned 18 in high school (mainly seniors, but if you were friends with them they could just buy it). I recall when we wanted alcohol we had to pay someone who was 21+ to buy it, or you had that one person in school with a fake ID. It was just much more difficult to get alcohol."

Most of my friends did consume alcohol more often than they smoked (most just didnt smoke) but it was much harder to get alcohol than tobacco. We could just walk into a gas station and buy tobacco, whereas you couldn't just walk into a liquor store and buy it without an ID.  I do think vaping has made it easier (and less taboo) for minors to consume tobacco. Overall it would seem that alcohol seems to be the go to for the majority of kids because it's something nearly everyone thinks is cool, and has fun doing. I can see it being more popular among youth."

I have a feeling that alcohol is already very difficult to obtain (in relation to tobacco, and I'm not saying booze is that difficult to get), so they dont target flavors of alcohol like they do tobacco."
