rugbyunion,ffw7lz9,t1_ffw73f3,1580288150.0,"Yep. That’s why the overall injuries have gone up in this aspect of play. 

But what is interesting is the correlation of burden of injury to attack vs defender. For every tackle there must be both a ball carrier and tackler. 

I’m wondering if any rule changes in that period had something to do with it. Obviously it’s the latest retrospective study, so it’s based on 2018 rather than now."

And don’t forget my username. It’s a tribute to Nick Sandman, (which ironically is precisely the topic at hand in the post) and Article 13 of the Eurozone to curtail ‘free speech’ and be able to control people’s thinking from engaging in thought crimes. It’s a ‘copyright’ law, that basically they can chose how to marshal it and remove and prosecute as they deem fit. Which translates to... nobody gives a shit to enforce.. unless... Ofcourse they don’t like what you are saying. (The anti meme law.. but one of the most destructive. 

Two of the most important things, people casually just run over. 

The vilification of innocent good people - nick sandman. And article 13. 

Also 313 is the angel number. 

>Angel number 313 is a sign of progress and moving forward. You may be at a place in your life where you’re not progressing. Take a moment and look at what is holding you back.

These are the 3 pillars for a free just and human society that can not be infringed. 

1. Misinformation and identity politics turned into persecution of the individual.

2. Free speech and though policing

The left must hate the right outlook in order to keep a grip of them. They must do a proverbial painting of evil and identity politics where it doesn’t exist. 

And when your postmodern facade is wiped away, you’re left with nothing, but a weaponised attack against individuals... how dare you speak. How dare you say that. How dare you speak reason.. how dare you.. talk to men about self development. How dare you question that the world is a patriarchy. How dare you.. 

And that’s what you refer to as a ‘gateway’ to the right and your use alt-right to dictate extreme? Or nazi? Lol.. 

You call Peterson what? Alt right? He is more left than trump and many others. But for you it’s convenient. Because for you, trump and his millions of voters as the duly elected president is all some sort of alt right gang.

Your gig is up. You simply sound stupid. And there is actually nothing to talk about. Just explaining why nobody cares what you think anymore. It boils you inside as you see former leftists walk away and find the light, while you are stuck there with your self loathing."

Same tragedy, most of the people nobody even mentions. 

And the one known by all, who was also very likely raped someone, although I can’t judge especially now, is made out to be some Demi-god. As far as I’m concerned, he was just good at playing with a ball.

If accuser gets him sent to prison? So what? He’s in prison for rest of his life.. she still got raped. And is no better for it. It’s revenge in a way.. the other option is to settle... and for her to make a few million and move on with her life.

Also, for the record we don’t know how the virus did start. The exotic meats is one theory. Like bats and snake, market. Also what Chinese government went with. 

This post actually does a bad job of explaining all the details of the bioweapon facility, that also exists in Wuhan for the record that was testing very deadly viruses including SARS. This is not fiction. It’s 100 percent true. This facility was known by international community for years also what they were testing. So yes theory no2 is a bioweapon leak. Both are feasible.
