AskReddit,ffb55eb,t3_esi1iu,1579752064.0,"I worked for Borders for 12 years. Towards the end of my time there, I took a position as the General Manager of a store, coming from working in the Home Office. After the first quarter, I saw my financial results, & really just started doing the math. It was horribly unsustainable. Every month you could see in black & white that the objective was to just control the bleeding as much as possible. My boss told me that I’d get a bonus for ONLY losing several hundred thousand in sales. I started looking & found another job, the day I called my boss to give my two weeks notice, they sent around a memo telling us that our retirement was now frozen & there would be no further contributions. Within two years they were completely bankrupt & shuttered all the stores, in what some long time friends told me was a humiliating & painful liquidation process."

minnesota,ff3d30v,t1_ff3cpfl,1579538719.0,"The first article I read about it a couple days ago mentioned the initial crash, but going back, I’ve been unable to find the article, as it’s been updated a few times. It basically said that originally officers thought one/some people ran off after the accident. It makes me think the victim must’ve been able to get out of his car, then was struck or otherwise incapacitated after, or there would’ve been more investigation. Also, I know there was a storm, but what about removing the car? Looking for the owner? No family or friends or employer was looking for him?"
minnesota,ff39mky,t1_ff2xw8c,1579536925.0,"There are a lot of questions that the media seem to be tip toeing around. I get it that they are mostly embarrassing questions, but still, that's their job. For example, how did the victim get out of the car without leaving evidence? If you're an officer on the scene & you see a crash & the door is open, a window is smashed outwards, etc...you're looking for a victim, right? Or did the victim get out the car, then was hit by another car that ran? So many questions...."

It made the tomato brighter & sweeter & the meat meatier somehow. They’re not a bold taste, but they noticeably enhance certain foods."

TooAfraidToAsk,fezrive,t3_eqz3ua,1579460730.0,"About 10 years ago I worked for a short while at a grocery store / liquor store in Phoenix. When it would get unbearably hot in the summer (110ºF +) homeless people would come in & covertly take a bottle of whatever & then chug as much as they could to pass out in the bathroom, knowing they would then be transported to 48 hour detox followed by jail, both well air conditioned. I was stunned to find out this was commonplace."

IsItBullshit,fee30y3,t3_eoivnt,1579025348.0,"I did this during a three month rotation at work about 10 years ago. I would sleep from 9p-1a, get up & go to work, then come home around noon, sleep for 4 hours, then get up & be social, make dinner, etc....
It worked for the time, but there was never a time when I wasn’t tired, or would have happily taken a nap. I think it worked short term, but I doubt you could survive for an extended time without exhaustion, or other mental health problems, not to mention the chance of an accident."
