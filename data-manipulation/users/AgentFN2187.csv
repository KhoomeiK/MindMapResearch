HistoryMemes,ffejqae,t1_ffejbc9,1579850860.0,"It was, it was that or invade Japan, more people would have likely died if we invaded. At the time there was literally no difference in public mind between a nuke and a regular bomb other than one was more explosive. The regular bombing campaigns of other cities in ww2 killed more people that the nuking of hiroshima and nagasaki, yet you don't see anyone bitching about that because it is *war*. There is no reason to say that the nukes were any worse than the regular bombing campaigns, not to mention they started the war by sneak attacking us and refused to surrender."

HistoryMemes,ffcc3w2,t1_ffbysix,1579796239.0,"True story, one time my family and I were in St Louis when I was a kid, we were trying to get something to eat so my dad put burger king into the GPS, what he didn't know is it was set to a walking route so it was trying to bring us there in a really roundabout way. The path took us through some of the most ghetto parts of St Louis, one of the places we drove by a man had been shot outside of his home just the night before. In the middle of it all was a Wonderbread factory, I haven't eaten wonderbread since."
