DenverBroncos,ff3w2m7,t1_ff3uwjn,1579550110.0,So what you're saying is that the Chiefs implode during and after the SB?
DenverBroncos,ff3vvx7,t1_ff3slqb,1579549995.0,"I think if we extend him this year or next, he gets around that range. If they wait until he's a free agent to try to sign him, he'll probably be worth more if his production stays the same.

Considering Vons current contract, I could see teams willing to pay him that. I don't think we do though honestly. Maybe he wants to stay here and takes like a 3 year, 17 million deal."
DenverBroncos,ff3pw0e,t1_ff38uyq,1579546296.0,"Overall I just feel our cap situation is much more favorable but this is a fair point so we can go ahead and take a deep dive at it.

Major players on the Broncos with contracts that will need to be addressed in the coming future include: Lindsay (2021), Sutton (2021), Miller (2021), and Lock (2022).

Obviously it's hard to predict how these guys will play out in the future so we're kind of just shooting in the dark. 

I like Lindsay but unfortunately RBs are a dime in a dozen. He becomes a RFA after 2021 which we could then place a tender on for a little more than 3 mil to keep him till 2022, after which he'll already be 28/29. Maybe we extend him at some point this year or next, but I can't see us going over 10-11mil a year for him (and I'm not sure if we should). 

Sutton is a hard. If he continues to dominate and play well, he might be looking north of 18 mil a year. 

Honestly, I have no idea what kind of money it would take to keep Miller.

The big one will be Lock, if he becomes the guy. I'm expecting Mahomes to get near a 40mil a year contract. If Lock becomes our guy, while I don't think he gets the top 40+mil, he probably gets at least 35+mil.

Considering we're looking at 2-3 years in the future, we'll also have at least 20-30mil more cap space to play with.

Maybe we get in a bind by 2022, but I still think the Chiefs window is narrowing. Some team is going to pay Chris Jones this off-season and his market value is at 19mil right now. Maybe they're okay with letting him go though"
DenverBroncos,ff396fj,t1_ff2vxky,1579536638.0,I think the Raiders have a pretty good foundation too. They're kind of built like the Titans without the vertical passing game and more of a dink/dunk. I don't think they'll overtake the Chiefs but they're probably the closest wildcard competition in our division.
DenverBroncos,ff32pw0,t3_erapbd,1579532139.0,"Here are some things to keep in mind in regards to KC. Mahomes' contract is up after next year along with Kelce's. Hill's is up after 2022. Mahomes is most likely going to get the biggest QB contract we've seen so far which will heavily affect the pieces they can put around him. 

This year they only have $21mil left to play with and they still have Chris Jones to think about. From what I've seen, the assumption is that they'll cut Watkins, save 14mil and use that to give Jones his next contract. I'm assuming they'll cut more players than just him to make more room. 

If this is the case, and even if we assume the cap goes up by around 11mil, the Chiefs are still in a pretty tight bind when it comes to cap space.

The other option would be for to not retain Jones at all and have that extra money going into Mahomes' and Kelce's contract year.

The way I see it, the Chiefs window is narrowing and ours is widening. We have a good offensive core on light contracts. We most likely draft another stud receiver to help the offense. We have enough cap space to bolster up our defense."
nfl,ff0k0ox,t1_ff0jv2s,1579469566.0,Definitely more of the defense not wanting to lay him out and get flagged
nfl,ff0jmwa,t1_ff0jcrt,1579469485.0,Yeah that's what I was thinking too
DenverBroncos,feyouz0,t3_eqlwpj,1579448488.0,"Honestly, I kind of liked them during the Alex Smith era. However...this iteration of the Chiefs have a child beater at WR and crybaby at TE and I can't fucking stand them"
DenverBroncos,feymufe,t1_fewjxg6,1579447706.0,I think I'm okay with them winning 1...after we win like 3-4 more of course
nfl,fet4t39,t3_eq54sv,1579371797.0,"This probably has more to do with the new era of QBs being more willing to take risks and extend plays. It's a go big, go home style that contrasts the pocket passing Manning/Brady era where they would just dump the ball if the play wasn't there.

It'll be interesting to see what kind of longevity we get from this new era of QBs. These guys are young now and can rely on their athleticism, but it won't last forever and they're not going to be able to tank hits forever either."
nfl,fet38zn,t3_eq77tl,1579371376.0,You probably don't need to be good at drafting WRs if you're just using TEs and gym rats to run inside routes for you all the time

natureismetal,feojfv7,t3_eq1qm6,1579300911.0,Lions have a lot of skill points in slashing damage but no armor pen. This generally works in the Hippos favor who has a naturally high base defense but unfortunately Lions gain a huge tenacity bonus when they enter starvation mode. They also tend to do boss raids in large parties

DenverBroncos,fem2xny,t3_epq83e,1579237999.0,"12/13 wins is a bit too optimistic imo, but I'll take it if it happens. Personally I see us grabbing a wildcard at 10-6 with our ceiling probably being at 11 wins."
DenverBroncos,fem2oyc,t3_epqjgu,1579237779.0,"Man we're probably looking at like 10-11mil to resign him, but it's probably worth it to have some stability and retain a very good center"
DenverBroncos,fem22x1,t1_fem0vfh,1579237223.0,"Even if that's the case, I still think he'll be cheaper to keep. I like Shelby Harris, I just don't think we're going to pay him what he wants"
DenverBroncos,fem1f1w,t1_felsqc6,1579236636.0,"Not with 10,000 men could we do this. It is folly.. 

Chris Jones is getting at least 19mil. I'm guessing Byron Jones will be around 12-14mil..."
DenverBroncos,fem0tgc,t3_epsham,1579236108.0,"I think we retain Wolfe because he'll take another friendly deal with the team. CHJ and Shelby will be gone.  

Imo we should target Byron Jones to shore up our CB situation and then grab another CB through the draft. Callahan's injury history worries me and Bausby is still an unknown quantity."
DenverBroncos,felz1vb,t1_fejz330,1579234630.0,"Spotrac puts his market value at 19mil right now. On one hand, in this dream scenario, this would make our dline pretty impressive and on the other hand, a lot of our cap would be tied to two defensive players. 

Maybe it's the right move to try to secure a really good defense once again since most of our offense is a bunch of guys on cheap contracts. I'm not sure though. I think we should try to target somebody like Byron Jones as well to really shore up our CB situation"

DenverBroncos,ff3w2m7,t1_ff3uwjn,1579550110.0,So what you're saying is that the Chiefs implode during and after the SB?
DenverBroncos,ff3vvx7,t1_ff3slqb,1579549995.0,"I think if we extend him this year or next, he gets around that range. If they wait until he's a free agent to try to sign him, he'll probably be worth more if his production stays the same.

Considering Vons current contract, I could see teams willing to pay him that. I don't think we do though honestly. Maybe he wants to stay here and takes like a 3 year, 17 million deal."
DenverBroncos,ff3pw0e,t1_ff38uyq,1579546296.0,"Overall I just feel our cap situation is much more favorable but this is a fair point so we can go ahead and take a deep dive at it.

Major players on the Broncos with contracts that will need to be addressed in the coming future include: Lindsay (2021), Sutton (2021), Miller (2021), and Lock (2022).

Obviously it's hard to predict how these guys will play out in the future so we're kind of just shooting in the dark. 

I like Lindsay but unfortunately RBs are a dime in a dozen. He becomes a RFA after 2021 which we could then place a tender on for a little more than 3 mil to keep him till 2022, after which he'll already be 28/29. Maybe we extend him at some point this year or next, but I can't see us going over 10-11mil a year for him (and I'm not sure if we should). 

Sutton is a hard. If he continues to dominate and play well, he might be looking north of 18 mil a year. 

Honestly, I have no idea what kind of money it would take to keep Miller.

The big one will be Lock, if he becomes the guy. I'm expecting Mahomes to get near a 40mil a year contract. If Lock becomes our guy, while I don't think he gets the top 40+mil, he probably gets at least 35+mil.

Considering we're looking at 2-3 years in the future, we'll also have at least 20-30mil more cap space to play with.

Maybe we get in a bind by 2022, but I still think the Chiefs window is narrowing. Some team is going to pay Chris Jones this off-season and his market value is at 19mil right now. Maybe they're okay with letting him go though"
DenverBroncos,ff396fj,t1_ff2vxky,1579536638.0,I think the Raiders have a pretty good foundation too. They're kind of built like the Titans without the vertical passing game and more of a dink/dunk. I don't think they'll overtake the Chiefs but they're probably the closest wildcard competition in our division.
DenverBroncos,ff32pw0,t3_erapbd,1579532139.0,"Here are some things to keep in mind in regards to KC. Mahomes' contract is up after next year along with Kelce's. Hill's is up after 2022. Mahomes is most likely going to get the biggest QB contract we've seen so far which will heavily affect the pieces they can put around him. 

This year they only have $21mil left to play with and they still have Chris Jones to think about. From what I've seen, the assumption is that they'll cut Watkins, save 14mil and use that to give Jones his next contract. I'm assuming they'll cut more players than just him to make more room. 

If this is the case, and even if we assume the cap goes up by around 11mil, the Chiefs are still in a pretty tight bind when it comes to cap space.

The other option would be for to not retain Jones at all and have that extra money going into Mahomes' and Kelce's contract year.

The way I see it, the Chiefs window is narrowing and ours is widening. We have a good offensive core on light contracts. We most likely draft another stud receiver to help the offense. We have enough cap space to bolster up our defense."
nfl,ff0k0ox,t1_ff0jv2s,1579469566.0,Definitely more of the defense not wanting to lay him out and get flagged
nfl,ff0jmwa,t1_ff0jcrt,1579469485.0,Yeah that's what I was thinking too
DenverBroncos,feyouz0,t3_eqlwpj,1579448488.0,"Honestly, I kind of liked them during the Alex Smith era. However...this iteration of the Chiefs have a child beater at WR and crybaby at TE and I can't fucking stand them"
DenverBroncos,feymufe,t1_fewjxg6,1579447706.0,I think I'm okay with them winning 1...after we win like 3-4 more of course
nfl,fet4t39,t3_eq54sv,1579371797.0,"This probably has more to do with the new era of QBs being more willing to take risks and extend plays. It's a go big, go home style that contrasts the pocket passing Manning/Brady era where they would just dump the ball if the play wasn't there.

It'll be interesting to see what kind of longevity we get from this new era of QBs. These guys are young now and can rely on their athleticism, but it won't last forever and they're not going to be able to tank hits forever either."
nfl,fet38zn,t3_eq77tl,1579371376.0,You probably don't need to be good at drafting WRs if you're just using TEs and gym rats to run inside routes for you all the time

natureismetal,feojfv7,t3_eq1qm6,1579300911.0,Lions have a lot of skill points in slashing damage but no armor pen. This generally works in the Hippos favor who has a naturally high base defense but unfortunately Lions gain a huge tenacity bonus when they enter starvation mode. They also tend to do boss raids in large parties
natureismetal,femwa0w,t3_epz02b,1579271274.0,I mean can they even digest all of that or does it just start to rot in their stomach?
DenverBroncos,fem44ou,t3_eov8ct,1579239116.0,This is very good. Sounds like the dude needs to get a lot stronger
DenverBroncos,fem2xny,t3_epq83e,1579237999.0,"12/13 wins is a bit too optimistic imo, but I'll take it if it happens. Personally I see us grabbing a wildcard at 10-6 with our ceiling probably being at 11 wins."
DenverBroncos,fem2oyc,t3_epqjgu,1579237779.0,"Man we're probably looking at like 10-11mil to resign him, but it's probably worth it to have some stability and retain a very good center"
DenverBroncos,fem22x1,t1_fem0vfh,1579237223.0,"Even if that's the case, I still think he'll be cheaper to keep. I like Shelby Harris, I just don't think we're going to pay him what he wants"
DenverBroncos,fem1f1w,t1_felsqc6,1579236636.0,"Not with 10,000 men could we do this. It is folly.. 

Chris Jones is getting at least 19mil. I'm guessing Byron Jones will be around 12-14mil..."
DenverBroncos,fem0tgc,t3_epsham,1579236108.0,"I think we retain Wolfe because he'll take another friendly deal with the team. CHJ and Shelby will be gone.  

Imo we should target Byron Jones to shore up our CB situation and then grab another CB through the draft. Callahan's injury history worries me and Bausby is still an unknown quantity."
DenverBroncos,felz1vb,t1_fejz330,1579234630.0,"Spotrac puts his market value at 19mil right now. On one hand, in this dream scenario, this would make our dline pretty impressive and on the other hand, a lot of our cap would be tied to two defensive players. 

Maybe it's the right move to try to secure a really good defense once again since most of our offense is a bunch of guys on cheap contracts. I'm not sure though. I think we should try to target somebody like Byron Jones as well to really shore up our CB situation"

They should have watched the Ravens /Titans game for an example of what to do when you have a lead, granted they don't have Henry at running back, but the way the game was managed was still leagues ahead"

DenverBroncos,fe6clhz,t1_fe6c3oc,1578887024.0,"The only difference is that KC will definitely score points. I don't think they're going to fall apart in the same way that Baltimore did. Mahomes is a much better, more complete QB than Lamar."

It'll come down to if the Tandalorion can sustain drives and keep KC off the field. Even if they fail, I think the 9ers match up much better against KC anyways. That dline is nasty"
