That allusions of either violence or sex would receive PG-13 rating, while actual depiction of violence and nudity would get an R rating? If the content is marked as R-rated or M, due to violence then the parent could make the decision to let you watch it, but if it's marked as R-rated or M due to sex and they could choose to not let their kids watch it. The criticism that I would see is if R-rated sex is only allusions of sex and PG-13 is bloody depictions of violence, then those are not equivalent and the rating boards are making a value judgement that declares  “Violence mmkay, sexual content, not mmkay” which is a valid criticism of the ratings boards. Both violence and sex should be measured on similar yardsticks, if a parent refuses to buy gory violent games because they are rated M but are cool with girls in bikinis playing volleyball on the beach rated Teen or even E for everyone, then the parent can buy which ever game they want for their kids. The purchasing decision of the parent is what you seem to have problem with, either that or that you believe E, T PG-13 rated content should just be allowed to have more violence than it's sexual equivalent at the same ratings. Maybe they should just not have ratings and just have content descriptors since the ratings are intrinsically value judgements and the descriptors should have some objective basis (either nudity or not, blood and gore or not).

Your claim is that digital content will be pirated inevitably, so I gave examples where there was initially pirated digital content, and the market initially locked the content with copyright protection then progressed to where content wasn't owned, access to the content became a service instead. Couched in your claim is that digital piracy is unaffected by the streaming services and turning content from something the individual ""owned"" to a service where no one ever owns their content, they just pay a monthly fee to access it (which is more along the actual legal understanding of property of the abstract such as music or movies), which it simply is not. The American market, which is the bulk of the profits, has a persistent but small percentage of active loss of revenue from piracy. Pretending that your lived experience of heavy piracy is typical of the American. And if you are talking about the world outside of the US and the EU... well then, sorry for my classism, but I don't care about intellectual piracy in the world's equivalent of ""flyover country""."
