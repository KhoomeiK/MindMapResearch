From what I recall they outfit these really mean birds that are so viscous that they cant keep them around the hen's and aren't really good for eating, with razor or metal spurs for dual purposes. First is that it is cleaner than the naturally very sharp spur which holds bacteria that kills the opponent with infection and rather give them a clean spur to make it a quicker more visually interesting fight. Either way all the cocks are dead."
