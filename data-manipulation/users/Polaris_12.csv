AmItheAsshole,fe3cp0s,t3_eno5q8,1578848084.0,NTA. Dude is a moron. I was taking these kinds of pills 5 years BEFORE ever having sex and many women do the same. They arent exclusively tied to being sexually active.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fdzxjh4,t1_fdz9ild,1578798227.0,Do they not have scratchers everywhere meant for this? I have at least one in most areas of interest and I have no problems with them scratching anything other than an office chair they reaaaally like. Even that doesn't get very damaged :)
PCOS,fdzpl1u,t1_fdxz9uz,1578792928.0,"Ive had some laser sessions for about a year on my legs, everything under the knees. Holy f. did it help. Its been over 4 years since my last laser appointment and the hair hasnt come back (not really) so I dont have to shave more than once a month or twice. It was especially nice since I got that whole treatment for free because my endo was VERY NICE and had her own laser removal office thing at her house."

aww,fc1lcsd,t1_fc0k6sv,1577322222.0,Omg same here with my cats! One time one of them managed to put his head through the bag handle and then freaked himself out when the bag was ''chasing'' him as he ran away!! I laughed so hard
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fba7tig,t1_fb95kjj,1576668915.0,I read somewhere a kid kicked so hard while in the tummy he cracked his poor mom's rib. Maybe it was this kid!!!
