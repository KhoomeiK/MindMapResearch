aww,feli9l3,t3_epnbwl,1579222816.0,Weâ€™ve been â€œstealingâ€ feral kittens from a couple of areas that they stay near our home.  Weâ€™ve got 7 kittens since last spring. They have been so much fun to socialize and adopt out. Weâ€™re working on trapping and getting the adult feral cats fixed.
CraftBeer,felhng1,t1_felhi8u,1579222396.0,It really wasnâ€™t that hard to make. More time consuming than anything.
mildlyinteresting,felhc6j,t1_felfkzo,1579222182.0,I know what they are. In my area they are called â€œfuel pointsâ€. I just think the â€œpig pointsâ€ name is funny. It would be great if grocery stores just sold you stuff at a reasonable price without making you use â€œtheirâ€ points card for discounts...

Columbus,feefzjs,t3_eojful,1579032980.0,"We went there last weekend. Very good exhibits and fun to walk through. Itâ€™s no Meow Wolf (Santa Fe, New Mexico) but itâ€™s doing it right."
Westfalia,feefhz9,t3_eofvef,1579032692.0,Put down some sound deadening material before you do new carpet (or whatever). Youâ€™ll thank me later.
