gunpolitics,ffpyojq,t1_ffp8ha1,1580111229.0,"New Jersey requires a license to own even bb guns. And it took 14 months for mine to process, just like it did for everyone in my town and I was a firefighter and things like my boss interviewed over the phone by a detective as well as my doctor and two references, I needed to pay 100 dollars for ""approved"" fingerprints, I needed to supply my mortgage papers and a notarized piece of mail and finally a Drivers Records Check forum faxed to NJDOT. 

The reality is, none of those cases matter until there is a lawsuit, and people have been suing in NJ for example for over 60 years. In fact there was a town in NJ where the Police Chief, who is required to sign the FID approval, didn't grant any at all, because he didn't want to. By law in NJ it can't take over 30 days to issue a FID or pistol permit for each handgun, but in reality it takes usually 3 months, plus many additional requirements in most towns, and my town it was always over a year for both the FID and the pistol permits, imagine having to wait over a year to purchase a new handgun even if it is a bb gun handgun.

In NJ they can deny you if you have talked to your doctor that maybe you have ADD, or things like you went to a marriage councilor, someone found out you are getting a FID or pistol permit so they tell your local police you shouldn't have one, your driving record is bad and many other things. The NJ FID and pistol permits by the law are ""shall issue,"" however, they are not even close to that, just like how the law states it has to take 30 days or less but in reality can take over a year, and towns are not allowed to add additional requirements, but almost all towns in North and Central Jersey add requirements, my town added 5 additional requirements and recently added a requirement to submit a form to NJ DOT for a drivers record check. Police chiefs have denied their neighbors because they don't like them, they have denied current fire-chiefs, active duty military, mayors and many other people who should be allowed to own a firearm, let alone a bb gun. It is under the sole discretion of your police chief to allow you to own a firearm. Sure, eventually the people sue the township in court after a denial, but they still have a denial for firearms on their records, and they still have to spend thousands of dollars and months in court to get their FID or Pistol Permits. My fire-department's sister department's chief was denied because the school made him meet with a guidance councilor after his mother passed away when he was in high-school some 20 years back. The township considered this talking to a mental health practitioner, which most towns will deny you for and he spent over a year in court and over 10,000 dollars fighting, and at the end they were like ""sorry, here you go,"" the police didn't make any changes and a year later something similar happened to a fire-fighter in my department, his wife and him went to marriage counseling and they denied a recent pistol permit application even though he already had a FID and had gotten pistol permits prior."

The trees were mostly pine, we and our sister company in the town each had one brush truck. I went out on an engine as I got to the station late.

Structure fires happen fast, in fact with modern construction wooden truss homes, the entire house can collapse in minutes. However forest fires can be even quicker to compromise you.

With brush fires it is unpredictable, at best we know where the wind might blow, but it is not certain. The time we had the brush fire on the mountain, I got there on a engine but was in charge of our duty truck when I got off. It was a tiny fire compared to what hot shots and wild land firefighters deal with, maybe 30 acres or so, however the trees were all pines. 

I was in the duty truck with one firefighter and a junior to hook up a cistern as that was all the water on the mountain. We were driving and everything was seeming normal, no smoke at all even. We pulled onto the street where the cistern was at to fill up the duty trucks tank. All of the sudden, the wind changed, what seemed totally unaffected by the fire changed to smoked blowing to our right, almost as soon as the smoke came we saw flames. The firefighter with us who was a veteran told us to get in the truck, he drove us like a bat out of hell to command. I later learned that the place we were was close to our counties wild land firefighters and was overwhelmed, the cistern was completely overwhelmed with fire maybe 10 or so minutes later.

They teach you a lot about wild land firefighting in Fire 1, but you don't expect it, especially in New Jersey to be that bad.

These guys are heroes, wild land firefighters and hotshots are the most badass firefighters there are. I would rather step into a structure fire than be fighting a forest fire even with the tent thing to save themselves in a forest fire. At least with structure fires there is a plan of attack and you can predict things, wild fires a wind shifts directions suddenly you are fucked."
