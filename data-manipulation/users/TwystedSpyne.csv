By this quote, Aurelius is not dismissing time as valueless as you seem to think, but rather establishing that it is completely out of your control - hence you should not be worrying about it. Whether you die tomorrow or a day after tomorrow - it is not in your control. Even if you beg for an additional day, it would make little difference. Similarly, years pass on and you will barely notice this. So start working on your long-term goals now or whenever you wish, just knowing that tomorrow and next year is not a big difference, and time will fly. Of course you cannot know the future - but even if you did - a stoic would never use all his savings for a pleasure trip, there are more virtuous options - such as leaving it to loved ones, as you said. So, for a stoic, it would make little difference."

From a stoic perspective, you're subjecting yourself voluntarily to something that leaves you less of yourself, you're essentially escaping from reality and yourself. While stoicism encourages you to maintain sobriety at all times, and take complete control of your actions and will. Since you're dependent on it, you're deliberately letting something go that should be in your complete control. But you have influence over this choice of yours. You can change it. But if you try it too quickly, you wouldn't succeed. Another stoic idea is willpower - and that it's a muscle that can be exercised. Exercise it, make your choice and choose not to use marijuana. You might not succeed at stopping entirely very quickly, but eventually you will."
Stoicism,fc2e524,t3_efs7h8,1577354943.0,"Nothing you do can get rid of loneliness. I speak from quite a bit of experience attempting to suppress it, the feelings of loneliness just comes naturally because we desire to be social innately, but sometimes there's no choice. So..

One way to deal with it is to change its name. It's solitude - not loneliness. It's not something that's negative or something that needs to change. Being alone gives you a lot of free reign - figure out interesting ways to use it in things you like. It's natural to be alone, you're not an exception to the norm. Millions of people spend their holidays in perfect solitude, by choice or not.

Another way is to socialise with strangers. Be something you're not. Go into random cafes and try to chat up strangers without expecting anything. No matter how positively or badly the experiences go, it's unlikely you'll be feeling lonely when you're back alone for a while."

Stoicism,fc00ieg,t1_fbzdsol,1577272024.0,"You  don't understand Stoicism if you think it should replace religion.  Religions often embrace stoicist principles themselves (like  indifference to greed, pleasure, materialism, remain calm in face of  disaster, ritual consolidation of willpower, among other things).  Stoicism does not teach you how or why to live - Stoicism leaves that to  you alone. Religion is supposed to give you purpose. Stoicism teaches  to find your own purpose. If faith in God is that purpose, than so be  it. Also, this quote perhaps teaches you more than the 'holy' books, but  for others, that might not be the case. Have you even read those books  you compare this quote to?
