dankmemes,fed3138,t1_fecyjf6,1578996264.0,"It sounds dumb, I'm sure you've read it before or heard it but positive attitude works wonders.  It doesn't solve everything, it won't magically get you laid, not saying that.  It still takes time, and you won't be good at it at first. Old habits die hard. I'm still working on it too.

But really. Even this comment you left just reeks of desperation and self pity seeking.  Its probably not your intention, but that's what everyone else sees and feels when you act like that.


Everyone gets rejected.  Don't take it personally. Even though it very much is, it really isn't. 

Idk how else to say it. But suck it up too.  Everyone has problems, life isn't going to hand you what you want.  You have to put in the work. And by that I mean be fun, be positive. People gravitate towards the fun people, no matter where you are what you're doing. Dating, going out with friends, at work.  If you're fun and always seem to be having a good time and happy, it will change your life."

Obviously I'm not saying they're basically the same thing just commenting on the perceived affects at least in my experience.

Also Ive noticed most drugs seem to affect me less, wonder if it's just the tolerance I have from Vyvanse"

I've been there bud, grew up with 2 friends, went home everyday after school because I didn't get invited anywhere, beaten up, items stolen, forced to eat lunch in the library or hallway everyday.

Senior year things calmed way down I will say.
But honestly, stop thinking about those fuckfaces.  Work on and focus on yourself. High school is only a short 4 years of your life."
