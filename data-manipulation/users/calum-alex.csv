relationship_advice,ffv6jz5,t3_ev999n,1580256876.0,Bro she fucking cheated lets not sugarcoat this now. Sorry this happened.
relationship_advice,ffv64t6,t3_euwtcn,1580256589.0,"This might be one of the pettiest revenge moves ever, wow. Thats some maturing hes got to do. Unpopular opinion: if he wants to be with you he will truly change but you have to set some clear boundaries if you want to support his change, dump his ass if he compromises the agreement."
sex,ffuzkq1,t1_ffuijpp,1580252370.0,"yeah OP, either you overcome it as a couple and put in the past or just move on and call it an experience."
sex,ffuz2xq,t1_ffubo8k,1580252099.0,"i think people just gotta stop fomo'ing threesomes as if its a thing you HAVE to try. Its totally fine to never try it with your partner because its not an experience you can take back. I think the ""gotta try it to know if you do or dont like it"" mentality is taking things too lightly."
sex,ffuyhr2,t1_ffu4w3r,1580251769.0,"problem is, you cant take back certain things..."
sex,ffuyfsn,t3_ev8sgb,1580251739.0,"Sounds like regret... realizing you care about her and want something exclusive with her, and if you could do it again, would have never went through with the threesome. It might be a defense mechanism youre experiencing because you actually might be hurting deep down inside that your SO had intimate contact with someone else. I can see why you would block it out. I think at this point you two have to own up that whats done is done but that it doesnt have to be the end of you guys, just that its a one off that wont ever happen again. There really isnt a right or wrong answer. But if its too much for you then just move on because it can be hard to get past this for some people."
relationship_advice,ffux1bw,t3_ev66yp,1580250967.0,"Ya'll sound like a couple approaching middle aged status and on the brink of divorce. Can you imagine the immensely great partner you deserve? you've settled for a mediocre guy. Infact, you've become his mother. You're dragging yourself down by feeling bad for him, he's taking you down with him."
relationship_advice,ffpnwa6,t3_eucoam,1580099868.0,He’s Defitnely overstepping his boundaries and honestly he needs to take a step and ask himself if he’s your boyfriend or if he wants to be your parent. That is if he can manage to mend things with you. If this last straw doesn’t open his eyes then you have a tough time ahead of you if you stay. He has issues if he never gets tired of telling you what to do. Who actually enjoys telling their significant other what to do like they’re a child? Not attractive at all.
tifu,ffpko04,t3_eudp05,1580097369.0,"This is so confusing, if your cousin is at the party you could have just pretended you had no underwear cuse ugh you forgot you ran out of them that same day because you forgot to do laundry? They prob would of laughed and it would of been fine no one would question that you dont want to get naked in front of random people and especially your cousin.. you might of overdid it there"
offmychest,ffpickm,t1_ffnxmss,1580095751.0,what a reddit twist
offmychest,ffpibiy,t1_ffpgwif,1580095730.0,Lol same tbh I'm glad this took a whole plot twist
offmychest,ffpi82m,t3_eucov4,1580095667.0,"Wow how slightly jaded has reddit made me? I almost thought this was going in the opposite direction it did lol. I need this boost of hope in humanity, thank you."
relationship_advice,ffo8ibm,t3_eu5gfv,1580075181.0,Bruh its so embarassing you had to go through all of that and so naive of you to be telling yourself you're in love with her and want to marry her... you need to raise your standards. You're being treated like some extra in a movie.
relationship_advice,ffclm5n,t3_esufvn,1579802066.0,"I saw someone else say this too but its exactly what I was thinking. I thought this was going to be a story of how you two got together young, made it into adulthood, you became succesful and he became a bum. But no, he has degrees? That was a real plot twist, I was thinking ""OP really seemed hopeless about him for a second"". Why are you so hopeless about him? The man has several degrees. The career hes trying to pursue might not be for him and it shows. Like others said, maybe he needs a different place in the medical field he can feel better in. I truly wonder why instead of making that switch, he's driving himself crazy over and over through the years trying to accomplish something that never happens. That's defitnely something psychological. I hope hes able to wake up one day anxiety free and figure out what he wants to do and where to go. He's not a lost cause just perhaps a little misguided."
