news,ffesfyx,t1_fferx4g,1579863327.0,"You can walk into a walmart and get a prepaid debit card. There is absolutely no check for these cards as they are completely prepaid, but function identically to regular bank cards, you can even use direct deposit on them. The biggest downside is that you have to be careful with fees. You do not need a full bank to have a debit card."
kpop,ffe4dyq,t1_ffdwjje,1579836393.0,"For something this minor and the fact that it was likely done from outside Korea, I'd say its unlikely they would be able to really get an international investigation into actually finding them since it seems like all they did is change the frontend serving files, though it looks like their backend database was also exposed, but just the name of it."
news,ffco10a,t1_ffcjt3i,1579803543.0,Ive seen this said before. Its true that we haven't explored the entire ocean floor but realistically there is no benefit to looking any closer. Why should we waste time on looking at the ocean when we have already done it. Do you think there is going to be some lost city of Atlantis down there?
GIDLE,ff9s3m5,t1_ff9fi6l,1579719981.0,Saying that spending a few weeks touring in other countries could cause them to fail is a little ridiculous. They are not going to go on a full tour the way Blackpink or BTS did. I also wouldn't trust any kfan on the matter as many of them would be happy to never see their favorites leave Korea. They fact of it is they are going to either succeed or fail irrelevant to touring outside of Korea.

Animemes,feyqrhq,t1_fey64lj,1579449358.0,I like it because the MC is both not a little bitch and not a total sociopath. No one is really a good person and all of them just need to sit the fuck down and talk it out but at least people are honest to a degree.

NoStupidQuestions,feu5ltg,t1_fes3jvg,1579383353.0,Exactly most (normal) people getting into these schools have full rides backing them up.
memes,fe6ttbz,t1_fe6rt8a,1578905121.0,There are plenty of ways to relieve stress that doing include becoming highly addicted to things that have entire armies of scientists doing everything they can to keep you *thinking* that you need them to function.
BikiniBottomTwitter,fdhry4k,t1_fdhr8og,1578429012.0,Yep Android since version 9 already has systems in place to detect apps you're not using and puts them into a freeze state until you go back to it. And with flag ships hitting 8gb of RAM you don't need to worry about memory either. Just let the phone handle it. Idk how this works on iPhone though.
buildapc,fdf9ucs,t1_fdf9qaf,1578356676.0,What model is the motherboard?
buildapc,fdf9nsq,t3_el31m3,1578356553.0,Look in your motherboard's manual. It will have a diagram of where all the fan headers are. Just connect the case fans to the closest fan header.
pcmasterrace,fdf9hef,t3_el319i,1578356431.0,Paying 1000$ for a netbook is insanity.
kpop,fd80ptl,t1_fd7rs29,1578212560.0,"Because they have made absolutely no effort to market to an english market. Their fandom is in China, they have no need to be popular anywhere else."
Fantasy,fd38tn6,t1_fd2q7a5,1578155786.0,Wow so many recommendations! Thank you very much for taking the time!
Fantasy,fd0ye26,t1_fd0tohz,1578125441.0,"I'd say the crew's, and especially Vins, relationships were a big part of what i enjoyed about Mistborn. And the overall magic system was unique. Anyway. Thank you for the pointers I'll be sure to look into them!"
Fantasy,fd0bwxr,t1_fczv7j6,1578116638.0,"So I just burned through the Mistborn trilogy over the last couple of weeks with Skyward before that and I am not sure if I am ready to dive into another Sanderson book, as you say it feels a bit samey. Any pointers of where I should go from there since I only recently got into reading fantasy?"
YouShouldKnow,fcuiwka,t1_fcug0k0,1577982024.0,"BitWarden is not self hosted. You *can* self host it but there isn't any reason to for most. BitWardens free tier will give you all the features you need, and is dead simple to use."
YouShouldKnow,fcuegei,t1_fcu1b6x,1577979015.0,"Use BitWarden. KeePass is great if you're going to use it offline, but as soon as you put it online to sync it it loses any benefit it has over hosted solutions and really youre just adding more effort for no big benefit."
YouShouldKnow,fcudrnh,t1_fcu2klu,1577978573.0,Its also no more secure than a hosted solution like BitWarden. As soon as you put the vault online you lose any benefit it has over a hosted solution.
YouShouldKnow,fcud90f,t1_fcu39uh,1577978237.0,"While KeePass is more secure in theory (ONLY if you do not put it online, putting it on google drive puts it on the same level as BitWarden), even if BitWardens servers are somehow hacked it'd be useless as they are encrypted in a way that you must have the original password. As long as your master password is secure enough, meaning not able to be social engineered, it is secure to a reasonable degree. Of course it can be broken but if its to that point then it is likely a directed attack by someone that knows you and has access to you physically."
Cyberpunk,fctulbe,t1_fcsgquq,1577960325.0,"While the style isn't around, that isn't what makes it look so amazing. This level of detail is just not found in anything but movies now."
kpop,fclhq7d,t1_fckbfjj,1577748064.0,The original producer is the one he shows the DM of. The original just didn't know anything about it either.
pcmasterrace,fcb1rsy,t1_fcaubxy,1577581042.0,I'm gonna have to look into it. Thanks for the info.
pcmasterrace,fcatv7b,t1_fc9kxuq,1577576506.0,How are you hitting 4.4 on all cores with the 3700X highest ive seen others get was 4.1 to all cores. What cooling are you running.
pcmasterrace,fcatipe,t1_fcamoe3,1577576313.0,"I just replaced my 4790k with a 3700x mainly because, while it was okay for most games, I was maxing out the CPU in CPU heavy games and at least around 85% in GPU locked. I saw a boost of up to 20fps with my 1080ti."

buildapc,fc14x2p,t1_fc0z9py,1577308360.0,"Also ensure the DP is properly seated all the way in, when i first got on the monitor worked without being completely in but only showed 60 fps."
