MurderedByWords,fepnhqr,t1_fepmxrb,1579325249.0,"I just wanted to point out that even if they are making more on their returns, the poor are still catching up if their percentage return is higher than rich people’s percentage return. So it’s dumb to get upset by that. 

If that statistic is not true that poor people’s returns are increasing each year by a higher percentage than rich people’s percentage returns, then the “murderer” is incorrectly arguing against an incorrect statistic, which is even stupider than I originally thought. Lol."
MurderedByWords,fepmc4v,t1_fep0e7q,1579324297.0,"Alex Kirshner, the murderer, is just retarded. Okay. 

I am poor. I have one dollar. 
You are rich. You have ten dollars. 
I make 50 percent return a year. 
You make 20 percent return a year. 
I make fifty cents the first year. 
You make 2 dollars the first year. 
Inequality. Boohoo. 

12 years later, assuming the returns each year are the same, I have 130 dollars. You have 89. 

Therefore the poor are catching up. 

Doesn’t take a rocket scientist. But it does take a tiny bit of common sense: something you all are obviously incapable of."

selfimprovement,fcwmui7,t1_fcwgz30,1578030124.0,"It helps me to get a little inwardly and sometimes outwardly pissed off whenever anyone gets mad or frustrated with me for not doing something for them or not listening to them (aka whenever people act entitled to your time, possessions, our actions). Keep an eye out for it and learn to despise it. That way you will recognize  thoughts that are the product of, for lack of a better phrase, programmed owing. Their entitlement makes us sometimes think we owe them when we don’t. 

I try to balance my hatred of this form of intellectual slavery with pure self-love and egoism. It lets me question when others do something for me. I don’t want them to do things because they think they owe me. I want them to do things they want to do. If our wants coincide and a mutually beneficial relationship forms, than great we are both happy. And if I think doing things for other people and trying to make them happy will make me happy, then great. You start to seek out freshness of intentions and the freedom that comes with it.

I hope this helps."
selfimprovement,fcw7jqv,t3_ej28x3,1578018950.0,"Happiness is fleeting. Contrary to popular belief, it isn’t a state where once you achieve it you have it for life. It arises temporarily out of the process of improving your life, doing what you want, and having what you want to have. There is always something that can be improved, something else to do, something else to have. 

Once you embrace this, you will constantly seek out what makes you happy in a continuous process of discovery and learning about what makes you happy.  

If you don’t feel that satisfaction upon achieving your social goals, my advice is to reflect and ask yourself if these social goals will make you happy. If you still think they will, go for it again and reflect. If you think they won’t, that is just as fine as the first option. Reflect, learn, and discover who you are. There is nothing wrong with who you are."
selfimprovement,fcw6faj,t1_fcw5i85,1578018222.0,"Also, it’s helpful in my opinion to realize that we, in general owe nothing to each other. Apologizing is suitable when we use force on another human being without their consent ex stealing or assaulting them or when we break promises. But when someone gets uncomfortable when I wear a sweatshirt to my college’s formal dinner, I sure as fuck am not going to apologize to them. I am not making them  feel that way and I owe them nothing. 

Anyway, I want this advice to help you. If you disagree or have follow up questions I would be happy to respond."
selfimprovement,fcw5i85,t3_ej7eh3,1578017625.0,"Instead of apologizing for inconveniencing people or whatever you think you might be doing, ask them if they are honestly having a good time directly. If they say yes, great. If they say no, then at least you know and you can ask follow up questions about why and what you can do to help them have a good time. It’s clear to me that you want to be with other people but want them to be happy being with you. If you express this to them, I believe your anxiety will be eased and you will come across as having confidence."
