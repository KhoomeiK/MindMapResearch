The plot twists when the Drug lords threaten to unravel the keystone of civilization with wild orgies, unless an ex-con with a big heart can learn to trust humanity again and stop the Drug lords once and for all.  The movie ends with a mildly comical and/or ironic scene in which the Drug lords blow up or go to prison.  Another satisfying tale of political intrigue and personal redemption closes, and we all walk away from this movie a little wiser."
