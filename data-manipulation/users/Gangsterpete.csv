Bullmastiff,fea620w,t1_fe6qgcp,1578944778.0,"This is one of the few times I would reccomend someone to get another breed. If you train them to guard, they might trigger an instinct that is dangerous as all hell in a dog that weighs around the same as a human. Their natural guard instinct should be enough, as well as their size (think, if the dog is alone, they're going to guard from strangers, but if you're there, they feel safe so no need to guard. Hope I conveyed that right.). I fear if you train them and their instinct and training go off at the wrong time it can be a serious danger to both you and the people around you. They are massive, and to train them to potentially hurt people is IMHO a absolutely terrible idea.


As for keeping people away from you, yeah, some people will keep their distance. But these dogs LOVE humans, and dog lovers usually love these kinds of dogs, so you will be approached rather often from people wanting to pet, and talk about dogs. They're relatively rare, so people will go out of their way to talk to you and find out what this giant lovable goofball is. I live in Norway, we stand 5 metres apart at busstops as a gauge to how introverted we are. When walking my bullmastiff I have gotten to know WAY more people than otherwise in my entire life (people who have owned boxers etc. will literally cross the street to come pet it even here). This doesn't sound like it would fit well with your needs. The ones that doesn't like dogs like this will cross the street though, so you got that going for you. I wouldn't get one if I was afraid of other people, it's naturally going to be between you, that's true, but you'll get a lot of social interaction.
