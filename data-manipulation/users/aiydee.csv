""but let's say you did somehow get rid of tipping, good luck getting good staff for Friday or Saturday nights.""  
I worked restaurants in Australia.  I got minimum wage.  
But here's the thing.  The mindset of Aussies is ""You have to earn your tip"".  That's it.  
If I did really good service, I got a tip.  
The big issue your argument has is ""Must tip"" and ""Must not tip""
It shouldn't be that.
It should be ""Mandatory Tipping"" and ""Voluntary Tipping""
You currently have Mandatory tipping.  (more or less)
Voluntary tipping means exactly what it says.  You did your job.  You get no tip.  You went above and beyond, then people can elect to tip you.  
I've had nights where I earned more in tips than my wages.  
I've had nights where I got no tips.
But at the end of the day, my wages paid my rent, bills and food.  
The tips allowed me to save and even buy treats."
KitchenConfidential,ffhfr8e,t1_fffz3l6,1579933364.0,"They are paying their staff more.  That's the point.  If you give the staff a payrise in any form, it has to be recovered elsewhere.  
This means food costs more.  
Sorry, but your comment was the most ""American comment ever"".  
I'm from a country of non-compulsory tipping.  The idea of it is repulsive.  And it's not ""No tipping"".  Great service earns tips!  It's just that normal service earns a living wage, great service earns living wage + more.  
We've got the offset covered in our pricing already.  We pay a little more so our servers get this.
Now I get that in America when a few restaurants trialed this, it ended badly.  But that is not the fault of the idea.  The idea is fine.  It's just that it needs to be a standard.  Not a few one offs.  
If everyone does it, business would be the same across the board.  
The hard part will be training Americans to tip again.  Once they learn that the person gets living wage they may feel tipping is non-compulsory.  That requires an attitude shift in Americans from ""It's compulsory"" to ""It's deserved"".  
It's not a great place to be in.  I'm glad I worked retail and restaurants in Australia.  My tips I earned bought me treats.  My wages paid the rent, bills and food."

Make sure you do the same for them!  If you go into their room, knock first.  (Respect is a 2 way street)  
If they agree to the 'knock before coming in' then if they come in without knocking, remind them every time, but do it respectfully.
