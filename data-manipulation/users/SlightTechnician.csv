A lot of professors require you to use the latest version of the textbook. Some will write their own textbook, usually the pretentious ones, just so they can line their pockets with even more than they already make. A few will recognize that the textbook scam and tell you the versions of the books that will work for the class or tell you if you even need the book at all.
