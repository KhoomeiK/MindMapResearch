You're telling me an 18yr has for years been refusing to take his meds despite knowing it will make him hostile and violent??? OP cant even leave his daughters alone with him!! No best wrong for being frustrated with the situation and wanting to leave the boy with his bio father who also takes great care of him like c'mon man. It would be different if the wife said no and he was trying to force it but this is just a guy trying to come up with a solution to a difficult gray area problem"
fatlogic,ffecvc4,t3_eszxrf,1579843429.0,"I think this is just pointing out that if you eat a healthy diet, then your entire diet is guilt free. Like it's ok to eat chocolate and bread as long it's in moderation. I personally dont see anything wrong with this post as I think it points out moderation"
fatlogic,ffeasfi,t1_ffe52oc,1579841526.0,"Because it isn't reality about health at every size, it's about them being unhappy and trying to suck others into the void with them"
fatlogic,ffeafw7,t3_et4zff,1579841221.0,If anything healthy dieting teaches one to be completely in tune with what their body actually needs and what is just emotional eating or eating just for the sensation in the mouth. These people love to feel victimized.
fatlogic,fek55jd,t1_fejvbry,1579192824.0,"I dont doubt that some part time jobs can just be that tiring, I'm doubting that the person in the post works a job that tiring, my bad"
fatlogic,fejmcb2,t1_feji96p,1579179734.0,I just realized that that's 7 days a week at 4.6 hours a day or 4 days a week at 8 hours each day. A part time job? What the hell kinda part time job you got that leaves you so absolutely exhausted that you have to make a conscious effort to talk to your friends and family and ugh makes it just so difficult to find the time to talk to your therapist and just forget about dating!
fatlogic,fej7e6c,t3_ep3w7r,1579160014.0,I really feel like these people dont even know what they're talking about anymore. Like if you asked them to say the same sentence twice they wouldn't be able to because they're just saying random trigger words/phrases.
fatlogic,feizj9f,t1_feiyoag,1579151687.0,"Stuff like needing a different doctor if you weigh more or less, I dont get how they dont get that it's purely a safety issue. If you weigh more, you have more body. Idk man if I have a 50 mile body, i dont want some doctor who specializes in 20 mile bodies working on me. If you have a Lamborghini you dont want the mechanic that's only ever worked on Toyotas or whatever working on your car. Doesnt the same principal apply? I mean, in the car scenario worse case is your car is fucked, in healthcare though, worse case is you die like ???"
fatlogic,feiz5l2,t3_epefe7,1579151352.0,"I do believe that there are doctors that will just write everything off on your weight just cause it's easy, but if the doctor you've been happily seeing for some time says something about your weight, shouldn't you at least try to work with them? Like you were so satisfied with their work before they mentioned your weight, its.....I cant even think of the word. When the doctor is saying stuff you like they're great, but the minute they imply you aren't the pinnacle of health then they're fatphobic a holes. Its....not very grown up behavior to say the least."

AmItheAsshole,fei5z66,t3_ep4bpf,1579131028.0,NTA I never understand why parents speak to their child(ren) as if they're adults and then get surprised when the kid is annoying as fuck and considered rude by other people and i even more dont understand how they think it's ok to let other people be irritated by their kid but they dont wanna be subject to it.
