I watched my first porn movie when I was like 6 at a friends house. 

I started masturbating and watching porn at 12.

I played GTA:SA around that time too. 

GTA introduced no new topics to me. I already knew about hookers and cocaine. In fact, I WANTED to go into the strip clubs and was annoyed the women weren't completely naked. 

None of that shit did any harm to me. 

You know how I developed warped views? 

Because my parents left me to come to my own conclusion. I couldn't talk to them about these things. If they knew what GTA was actually like, they wouldn't have let me played it.

And because of that, I was left to come to my own conclusions and unable to have a dialogue about it with them. 

Many kids grow up where their parents don't censor anything at all and they grow up just fine.

You think you're doing your children a favor by keeping them from these things, but it's either irrelevant because the effect is zero, or it's harmful because you're robbing them of a chance to understand and acclimate to reality.

I'm telling you right now, if your kid wanted drugs there's probably a plug in their school where they can score. You can't stop them from doing something if they want it bad enough.
