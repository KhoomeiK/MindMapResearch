Itâ€™s in their genetics to be aggressive towards other animals. Just because you donâ€™t like that fact, doesnâ€™t make it not true."

You canâ€™t say itâ€™s all how theyâ€™re raised and then go right on to say little dogs are worse. If thatâ€™s your belief, why donâ€™t you train your little dog better. They do *less* damage but you need to be *more* careful with them? Thatâ€™s just really stupid. 

If itâ€™s only pits from shelters with a bad past that attack (which itâ€™s not) then doesnâ€™t that mean pit rescue should stop being a thing since those rescue pits are the dangerous ones?"

Proof right there they donâ€™t know anything about pits. 

And pit owners arenâ€™t going to make any effort license their goddamn dogs just because theyâ€™re no longer banned.  Nothing will happen to a pit, whether licensed or not, if it mauls someone or a pet.  Theyâ€™re always allowed to do it a few times before theyâ€™re even considered dangerous."
BanPitBulls,ff80qkt,t3_es3zi8,1579662977.0,"Just a little scuffle. Iâ€™m so sure that those other dogs were just so mean to the poor pittie. 

Punctured a childâ€™s lip but good with children. But, as pit owners always like to remind us about their sweetest most gentle nanny dogs, the dog obviously didnâ€™t mean any harm since it was just a puncture  â€” if it really meant to hurt the child it would have just killed them.

That tail wag donâ€™t mean shit. My dogs wag their tails when they see a squirrel they want to kill. Pits wag their tails while theyâ€™re literally mauling a person or animal to death. Sure, thereâ€™s enough people out there who have pits and cats together that hasnâ€™t ended in tragedy, and some pits thankfully donâ€™t live up to their breedâ€™s standards, but it takes a real stupid asshole to even risk it.
