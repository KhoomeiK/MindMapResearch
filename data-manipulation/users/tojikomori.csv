Were you able to move/recover your girlfriend's fugu?"
hatch,ffgapwr,t1_febuiyl,1579902109.0,"Your best bet is to reach out to @dlanham on Twitter, but it hasn't reappeared in the App Store and now hatchpet.com is down too. The @Hatch Twitter account and Facebook page are still up but they haven't been active in years.

My guess is it didn't spark enough interest to justify continued development and was only left up this long for the benefit of invested fans. I don't want to make it sound like they took it down arbitrarily: it might have been swept away by Apple in some App Store cleanup, or been removed because David and team couldn't justify costs of development needed for upcoming changes in iOS, or any number of other reasonable reasons.

I still have my original fugu on my phone. Based on this thread I guess my next upgrade will be bittersweet."
