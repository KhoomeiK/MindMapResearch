politics,fdibiak,t3_eljf6y,1578439226.0,We obviously have a fucked up system to let one individual have this much power to make decisions on behalf of the country. This also shows how weak we are as a country to have both parties turn backs on each other for party gain rather than do what's right for the American people. Both parties should be ashamed of themselves....its not just a one sided issue.

sports,fctw96e,t1_fctl1vm,1577962755.0,"This is strictly business not a game anymore. To make a business successful you make it great across the board not one little slice. If you let that little piece run the show the rest is worthless so no point in keeping it. The God awful amount of money paid out is not worth keeping these mediocre (half the league) around anymore.... I'm not an NBA fan currently though I try, it's just tough when all other leagues keep it interesting and fair."
sports,fcs28cn,t1_fcrfvos,1577910344.0,Your always going to have your talented built teams..all league's have that. But NBA is the only sport where the players are dictating the teams. It takes away the fun and fairness from the non big city teams.
sports,fcs0i0d,t1_fcrjoys,1577909463.0,Well that too....its also turning into soccer where you fake being touched to draw fouls.  Can't play the game for more than 15 seconds without a whistle .
sports,fcreh98,t1_fcr051a,1577900740.0,No. Go back to the 90s where a vast majority of teams had equal opportunity and there wasn't just a few teams that were guaranteed to make it. And playoff time was an all out battle. Now it's pretty much predicted with the exception of an upset all the way up to the semi finals. Do you feel that it's fair for every team in the league today?
sports,fcr00ec,t1_fcqqq5w,1577894762.0,Only 10% of the teams have a chance...the others basically play the season warming up the super teams for their titles.
sports,fcq0hn1,t3_eicvb9,1577876104.0,"More like crooked NBA. There should never be ""super teams"". You used to have to build your team up and create talent now they band together and choose how they want it leaving 90 percent of teams with slim to nil chances...how there is still a fan base is beyond me."

Iamactuallyverybadass,fclcksh,t1_fclc5d3,1577744688.0,"Still wrong,  anyone can get a gun illegally pretty much anywhere. If you go to the bar and ask anyone if they have a gun for sale or walk around in the city....you can get a gun. This doesn't prevent psycho fuck heads from using weapons.
