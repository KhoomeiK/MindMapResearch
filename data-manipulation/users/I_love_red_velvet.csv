socialanxiety,fcudvf9,t1_fctw3pf,1577978642.0,"Ask how they spent New Year's eve, ask whether they made resolutions for 2020, etc."
socialanxiety,fctgxs6,t3_eitmk4,1577942924.0,Maybe she expected a move but sometimes it's good to play it safe. Better this than being too aggressive and getting rejected. You can try to have 4th date just the two of you for dinner or a movie and see how she reacts. If she is into you then she will definitely make time for your date. If she will not seem excited you can always try to inquire what's wrong.
socialanxiety,fctf9vt,t1_fctctpv,1577941399.0,"I did, yes. It was awesome to have the countdown and right when the New Year started the sky was filled with beautiful fireworks. It was so beautiful and exciting! Did you do something special on New Year's eve?  

As for the not replying part I also tried to rationalize and be logical but I got a little hurt as well.  It's so childish lol but I am sensitive like that. 

It's so awesome to have this subreddit in order to connect with people who understand what you are going through!"
socialanxiety,fcte8sb,t1_fctdc62,1577940469.0,Cuddling on the first date sounds so romantic. I hope it will work out between you two!
socialanxiety,fctcfpq,t1_fctbbp4,1577938917.0,Haha that's the fun part. Good luck! When initially reading your story I wasn't sure where it will go. I assumed that the girl would invite you to her place and after the act give you a bill for her services. Glad that she was genuinely interested in you instead.
socialanxiety,fctc2em,t1_fctae38,1577938609.0,"You actually don't need to document things. You can explain what that person does to you and if it violates company's policies (I am sure bullying violates all kinds of policies) HR must have a conversation with your bully and the bully will stop or will face consequences. You have more rights than you think. 

Or you can bring it up to your supervisor since it's a serious matter and must be addressed.

And if bully will lie about it then what's the worst than could happen? Nothing will be done. So either way you don't lose anything."
socialanxiety,fctb3pq,t3_eicz5l,1577937791.0,"Did they all reply? I had 2 who did not reply and my mind started playing a game called ""Let's play out a 100 scenarios of why they might hate you"". :)"
socialanxiety,fctayr2,t3_ehydoj,1577937678.0,I've been in the position of the red person who is expected to laugh at video but the video was not funny at all. So I had to force myself to smile.
socialanxiety,fctalkk,t1_fcp5whl,1577937382.0,I would love to attend such party because there would be no pressure or judgement. People would be on the same page.
socialanxiety,fctafw8,t3_ei16i8,1577937253.0,I recognize myself in this situation as well.
socialanxiety,fct9qfi,t3_eietu1,1577936677.0,Have you tried opening up to your family about your struggles? If they knew they might have been more supportive.
socialanxiety,fct9m25,t3_eif4rh,1577936580.0,"Honestly I know how you feel, at my previous job I felt bullied by a small circle of people (my boss and his circle of friends) and it was the worst. I switched jobs and now I am very happy. I highly suggest reporting your situation to HR and or your supervisor (unless he is the bully). It's their job to help you and to put bully in It's place. 

If not then try to find a different job and you might put this situation behind you."
socialanxiety,fct94j9,t3_eiojxs,1577936194.0,"Aw that's too bad. Kudos to you for going out if your way to actually meet this friend in person. You said his mother hates you but is the friend helpful and nice in real life as you expected? You can certainly cut your trip short if you can exchange ticket for an earlier one. Or you can try to talk to the mother and see if maybe once she gets to know you she won't hate you? That friend should have notified his mother in advance for sure. Don't feel bad, it's not your fault."
socialanxiety,fct8ota,t3_eigexm,1577935841.0,Bravo for trying and succeeding! You say you are ugly but the girl certainly wanted to kiss you so that means you might be more attractive than you give yourself credit for!
socialanxiety,fct8738,t3_eimq9g,1577935449.0,"No, you should not feel guilty. First your friends abandon you and then get upset that you leave? It is not normal. They should have not abandoned you in the first place. You are free to do as you please and if you prefer to leave early no one should judge you."
socialanxiety,fct7mql,t3_eidrqv,1577935016.0,This is me always. Lol
socialanxiety,fct7kqu,t3_eir6fh,1577934973.0,This really sucks! I am sorry how it turned out. Have you tried contacting the other 2 friends and sharing your perspective? Maybe if they see that you were just presented in the bad light by ex friend they might change their opinion?
socialanxiety,fct72s0,t3_einaop,1577934589.0,"You know what they say practice makes perfect. I always was intimidated talking to supervisors but it's ok, as time passes you get used to everything: people, supervisors, tasks. You also gain confidence because you know your tasks well and if you do a good job then the management notices. It's only hard the first two weeks when you are learning and supposed to catch up quickly. 

As for the hiring process I highly recommend finding the most often asked questions online and practice over and over how you will respond. You will ace interviews if you come well prepared."
socialanxiety,fct5uki,t3_eileiu,1577933656.0,I think you should bring it up to your supervisor and get managers involved. They will be able to solve this. Good thing you were there to help Sara out.
socialanxiety,fct0ixm,t3_eipfz8,1577929729.0,That's awesome!
socialanxiety,fct0cxc,t3_eik715,1577929607.0,I can relate big time. I am constantly feeling judged.
socialanxiety,fct00se,t3_eio5u1,1577929370.0,"How often do you meet therapist to make this progress? Therapists are expensive, I was wondering what is the reasonable frequency of therapy sessions? One of my resolutions for this year is to get into therapy."
socialanxiety,fcszox3,t3_eipq44,1577929140.0,Yes I do feel like that all the time! There are some people who just look kind and accepting and without knowing them I can be myself around them. If a very confident and good looking person comes to talk to me then I get all shy and get anxiety thinking they will judge me because I am not like them.
socialanxiety,fcszdu1,t3_eiokha,1577928920.0,No I don't have anxiety with my friend. But I do feel awkward when it's silence with other people and I have nothing to say and that person says nothing so we sit in silence lol.
socialanxiety,fcsyymf,t3_eikcp3,1577928623.0,"Yes I am like that as well. And if person doesn't reply back I start playing scenarios in my head on why I got no reply and what I have done wrong, etc."
socialanxiety,fcs8eg3,t1_fcru6hj,1577912894.0,I actually asked someone to ask for me if family relative saw the text and they told me not to worry because everything was received. I guess they don't feel necessary to respond. I think it's a bit rude but maybe it's just me.
socialanxiety,fcrw9j7,t1_fcru6hj,1577907488.0,Thank you for your reply. WhatsApp shows you if the message was seen or not and both are marked as seen so this is why I got annoyed. Frankly after writing my original post I felt much better. I guess I just needed to vent about it hehe.
AskReddit,fcrqkuu,t3_ebsol6,1577905291.0,Every time I had to be around a group of people my heart would beat fast and I would feel uncomfortable.
socialanxiety,fcpgwjz,t1_fcpddqb,1577863507.0,Well not everyone is the same
socialanxiety,fcpgj6c,t1_fcp7bex,1577863014.0,"Agreed, there must be a solution out there. Maybe a very good therapist who specializes on depressions and extreme social anxiety."
socialanxiety,fcjbwww,t1_fcfrx46,1577682504.0,Omg I so get what you are saying! As a kid I could make friends with anyone very fast! I also was shut up by adults and interrupted so I learned to speak less and to keep to myself more. I hate how the past affects us so much!
socialanxiety,fccx95w,t3_eh2ktg,1577603745.0,It takes time to find people you can click with. What social circles are you exposed to? Maybe there is another loner lurking around that you might connect to?
socialanxiety,fccwa3q,t3_egkxq3,1577603411.0,I am 29 and not sure which option to choose since you put it to both 21 to 29 and 29 to 45.
socialanxiety,fccv7s4,t1_fc9dt2c,1577603040.0,Love that show
socialanxiety,fccv58c,t3_egsqo4,1577603016.0,Yes I've watched The Office 5 times already. I found out that Netflix will remove them in January so I restarted it once again from the beginning.
socialanxiety,fccuixq,t3_egsym9,1577602794.0,"Well...she didn't seem like a friend, friends supposed to care about what you do and would want to know what is happening in your life. I think it's good that she is moving away because now you have time to find real friends who will care about you."
socialanxiety,fccu0ix,t3_egt0yz,1577602621.0,If it's just friends then text her again and see how long she responds. If it takes her a week to respond then I would stoo texting her. For sure people can be busy during the day but if they can't find 5 seconds in the evening to respond then I'd say they don't care about your conversation that much.
socialanxiety,fcct5ni,t3_egg04v,1577602328.0,Lol so true

socialanxiety,fccqjgi,t3_egspp0,1577601455.0,They don't know what it feels like so they are being rude themselves by saying things like that. If only they knew the struggle they would shut up.

socialanxiety,fccpdgg,t1_fccft18,1577601066.0,"True but put yourself in their position. You can't possibly be mad at cashier for serving customers in front of you in line. You stand there and wait for your turn. They will wait. And as for handling money you get used to it. Be careful not to accept fake cash, feel the money if material feels weird then check watermarks, etc.  Maybe your place of work will have machine to check cash. If someone shows up with fake cash they would try to buy the cheapest item. 

Also don't let anyone distract you while you handling money. Finish your transaction, give the right change. You will get used to all of it."
socialanxiety,fcco24s,t3_egyuwt,1577600624.0,"By first job do you mean part time while in school or official first job after graduation? While in school my first job was seller at ice cream joint. I think it helped with anxiety because my brain understood that this is a job so I was forced to talk to everyone who would come in no matter how strange or good looking they might be. So it ""desensitized"" me in a way? 
After graduating college my first job was receptionist at environmental analysis lab. I felt anxious around my coworkers at first because they were very judgy. Then once we got to know each other better it was all good. As for customers, since they were other company representatives they were polite and friendly (except for one). For sure sometimes I would rather stay in the back and help out than answer the phone but job is a job. At my current job I don't interact with clients so I am quite happy. 
Don't worry, practice your answers for interviews. You will be alright."
socialanxiety,fcclt4o,t3_egcail,1577599892.0,I play in my head what I will say and how that will sound and choose the better wording.
socialanxiety,fccl9j8,t3_egzff5,1577599700.0,You can bring picture to show your hairdresser.  I normally show picture or explain what I want which is layers haircut. I just have to mention where layers will start from and how short or long my hair should be. You can also mention if you want bangs or not.
socialanxiety,fcciwgu,t3_egw00w,1577598910.0,"I actually prefer being one on one if possible because I find that my anxiety appears in a group setting. Although I understand what you mean, with some people I just cannot relate even one on one. If I see person is not responsive then I just stop trying."
socialanxiety,fcci8wv,t3_eguh2x,1577598692.0,Lol I changed hairdresser for that reason. She normally would cut my hair but this time she told me that a man will be cutting my hair this time. He was a native speaker of my language so he took a long time cutting my hair and talking a lot about people I don't know about. After the haircut I couldn't come back because I was anxious whether I have to now choose this man for my haircut or my old hairdresser so I decided to switch salon entirely for a new one.

socialanxiety,fccg1x5,t3_eh1o55,1577597977.0,"Maybe you haven't found your circle yet? I mean some people will never click with you just because you are not compatible so it's not your fault, they are just not ""your people"". I felt what you described at my previous job. I switched jobs and I find I am doing socially  better at this new job because people are friendlier overall. 

At my new job there is this guy who has social anxiety, and while I also have social anxiety his is a way higher anxiety. I see he struggles so I try to include him in conversations and be fair. Some people will see you being left out and will do nothing, others will help you out and include you. I really hope you will find kind people who will include you."

socialanxiety,fccbjms,t1_fc4tuje,1577596527.0,No lol. It's funny and sad how many tricks our brains can play on us.

Some people might be jerks and would want to use your kindness but there are others who care and want you happiness. Don't be so hard on yourself.

socialanxiety,fc4p1xt,t3_eg4cre,1577423387.0,"To improve digestion try to drink hot water with lemon on empty stomach right when you wake up. It gently will cleanse your system and you will feel comfortable for the whole day. Try to avoid foods that make you bloat like beans, broccoli, cauliflower, etc. Also try to analyze what did you eat that made you gassy and avoid it. 

If you need more hours talk to your manager and explain your availabilities. Ask upfront why your hours were reduced, etc. Realize that your manager could care less about your appearance, what they care about is your work so try to do awesome work. 

I can relate regarding feeling that someone hates you. I struggle with this a lot as well. Most likely it's our brains playing tricks on us."

Sometimes they even post interview questions other candidates got from HR. Read reviews carefully, you might change your mind about certain companies.

Make sure to practice potential questions for interview. You can find those on Google.

And prepare some witty questions for employer as well. These might help you stand out from the crowd."

socialanxiety,fc4ncyk,t3_eg5hyw,1577421845.0,"If that person did not believe in your struggles that doesn't mean that others will be the same. At my previous job I felt like something was wrong with me. People did not invite me to lunch, I felt excluded all the time and I heard them gossiping about me and saying that I shouldn't be invited to outside events because I was boring. My boss in front of everyone told me one time that I was ""a pissy one"". He also told me outright at one point that he doesn't see me in any other position than my current one which translates to not being promoted ever in that company. 
I switched job for a number of reasons and I couldn't be happier! My new coworkers actually are nice, they listen to what I have to say and include me in office activities. I am by no means a social butterfly or anything but here I feel like I belong! I even got promoted recently and my new boss is nothing but nice to me. What I am leading to is that I hope you will find the right person to open up to. People do care, not all of them, some people really suck but there are special people that would love to hear what you are going through and support you."
