Once the court rules that’s 2 branches overruling the 3rd. 2 > 1 I know that math is hard to follow.

And sure you don’t have to commit a penal coded crime, and the senate doesn’t have to remove the president if they don’t think what he did is up to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. That’s how this work, sorry that you don’t like it.  Trump didn’t commit a crime, and he didn’t abuse his office, and he didn’t obstruct congress as he has no obligation to cooperate with congress, it’s called executive privilege. The courts are there to make him cooperate if they feel executive privilege is being abused, and the dems arguments were so weak they didn’t want to get embarrassed in court so they didn’t even try."

This isn’t complicated. Can we prove the president attempted to have a foreign country interfere with our election? The answer is factually no we can’t prove that, all we can prove is that he wanted Biden investigated for corruption and he had reason to believe, from Fox News or otherwise, rightly or not, that Biden was corrupt. That isn’t impeachable it’s as simple as that. The idea that we can infer his intent was to interfere in the 2020 election is purely circumstantial speculation.

If Trump honestly thought Biden was corrupt, no matter how bad the source of his info was, then his intent was to investigate corruption and there’s nothing illegal about withholding aid to force a county into cooperating with a corruption investigation. Without proving his intent was to have a foreign government influence the 2020 election there is no crime there, and that intent hasn’t been demonstrated in any capacity whatsoever. What he did might be shitty judgement based on bad info, but it isn’t a high crime or misdemeanor. Shapiro’s argument is perfectly valid, prove a crime was committed or gtfo.

Maybe it wasn’t, but Trump watches fox and fox said it was ergo Trump believed it was. Sure he pressured Ukraine to investigate it and announce that, but there was no evidence to suggest his motive was anything more that investigating someone he though was corrupt after years of having himself investigated every time he sneezes. The non circumstantial evidence to suggest he wanted to influence the 2020 election just isn’t there, and without that I don’t see how it’s an abuse of power to investigate what he believes was corruption."

The problem is that the republicans really don’t see it they way. They see Trump asking for cooperation from Ukraine to fight corruption, and say Biden isn’t immune to they just because he’s running for office. They don’t see abuse of power. 

Republicans don’t buy the obstruction of congress charges either. The president claiming executive privilege isn’t obstructing congress. For you have to go to court and if the courts order it then the president has to relent. They believe claiming executive privilege is a powerful of the executive that can only be overturned by the courts.

(Thanks trump, it was even higher for the poor middle class before) But when I start making millions? Rate doesn’t go up at all. Billions?

The branches are coequal with different responsibilities assigned to each.

The president has the authority to withhold aid if he wants the country receiving aid to investigate corruption first. We don’t have to speculate about if a democrat president did it, we have Biden’s own televised admission that Obama and him withheld aid to get Shokin fired. It’s been done before and what Trump did is no different."

politics,fel9urh,t1_fel1yun,1579217223.0,"I’m not willingly dense and I’m arguing that. As I stated in my other replies, Trump, being the simple minded man that he is, likely saw them calling Biden corrupt on Fox News and that was all that was needed to convince Trump that Biden was corrupt. From that point sure he asked them to investigate Biden, but what’s important is his intent.. aka why did he ask? If he asked because he though Biden was corrupt which seems likely to me then that’s completely legal. If he asked because he wanted to influence the 2020 election then that’s very illegal. The house had an impeachment inquiry with many witnesses and none of them would testify that Trump told them his intent was to sway the 2020 election. At the current time assuming that was his intent is pure unsubstantiated speculation by the left."
politics,fel8jfv,t1_fel2hnx,1579216381.0,"Not weird at all actually. Trump likely saw Fox News calling Biden corrupt, watched the video where Biden admits to withholding aid to get shokin fired, heard Biden’s son was working for a foreign energy company making huge amounts of money while his father was VP, and decided he thinks Biden is corrupt and wanted it investigated.

Does the above scenario not sound plausible to you? I don’t see what’s “so weird” about it at all, if fact Trump is pretty simple minded so I believe that’s likely how it happened. 

Nothing about that scenario makes his intent interfering with the 2020 election. He doesn’t have to have investigate anyone else to make his intent to investigate Biden due to his belief that Biden was corrupt. It doesn’t matter if Biden was or wasn’t corrupt. All that matters is Trumps’ intent in asking for the investigation."
politics,fel7ky3,t1_fel3nkb,1579215775.0,"You may call it a personal favor, but that’s not what it was. If the president asks another country to investigate someone is that a personal favor or a favor to our country? You’re speculating that Trumps intent was to influence the 2020 election, when the stated intent was to investigate corruption where Trump saw evidence that Biden was corrupt, likely while he was watching Fox News. 

It doesn’t matter if Biden was actually innocent, or shokin was actually corrupt, or if there really wasn’t any evidence, or if the sky is made of blue cotton candy. The only thing that matters is Trump’s intent and that he believed there was evidence that Biden was corrupt, and there’s no testimony from any witness saying Trump told them his intent was to interfere with the 2020 election, therefore your assertion that the request was for a personal favor is pure speculation."

AFAIK you are guessing at Trumps intent being to smear a political rival, when his stated intent was to investigate corruption where he saw evidence of Biden being corrupt.

politics,fel4dop,t1_fekylm8,1579213804.0,"The left can say it was for persona gain all they want, but until they find someone who can testify that Trump told them that it is speculation.

there’s no evidence or testimony from any witnesses supporting that Trumps intent was political gain. That’s pure speculation by the left. His stated intent was to investigate corruption where he suspected it, and unless he told someone otherwise and we hear testimony from whoever he told claiming he had a different intent is completely unsupported conjecture."

I wasn’t allowed to work for the US government because I smoked weed in the last 7 years.
