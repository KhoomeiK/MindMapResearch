> There is no convincing evidence of this.

This is what I was arguing against bud, my central point was not that the neurons themselves change which is why I said you'd be arguing semantics.

""We"" is the scientific community at large. 

The ""convincing evidence of this"" is the understanding of the brain and neuroplasticity. This is the default stance that has scientific research to back it up. Your assertion that ""Because skeptics such as myself would argue that the state of the brain is already a configuration of some decision made apriori. So it isn't driving behavior but merely reflecting the influence of my will, which instructs the brain on the desired course of action."" is completely without any sort of evidence, yet you demand I provide you proof of current scientific understanding.

If your will comes from outside your brain, then how in the world is that anything other than supernatural? And if your will comes from within your brain, then you're saying that your brain controls your brain which is circular and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

I cannot provide you a single peer reviewed source that adequately expresses everything you need to know about the brain, so I provided one that sounded like it was at least related to the topic. I probably shouldn't have bothered to include it because I highly doubt you would have read it unless it expressed my conclusion verbatim.

EDIT: In fact, let's go ahead and take this one step further. Why don't YOU provide ME a peer reviewed scientific article that proves your point about the will controlling the brain instead of it being the other way around? Since that is apparently, incredibly ironicly, the only evidence you will accept?"
DebateReligion,ffj5rj6,t1_ffj2vgf,1579991097.0,"From https://human-memory.net/brain-neurons-synapses/ :

> The connections between neurons are not static, though, they change over time. The more signals sent between two neurons, the stronger the connection grows (technically, the amplitude of the postsynaptic neuron’s response increases), and so, with each new experience and each remembered event or fact, the brain slightly re-wires its physical structure.

So yes, neurons do ""change"". More accurately the connections between them change. You can argue that's not the neuron itself changing but you'd be arguing semantics at that point. The brain can and does change on a regular basis. Both as a response to stimuli and body chemistry. 

I linked the above article because it is easy to digest, but I'll see if I can find something ""peer reviewed"" for you.

Here ya go: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4248571/

I haven't read through it, but the abstract sounds like it is related to what you are wanting to know, so have fun.

If you want to argue that there is no conclusion that these processes are the ""only things"" that affect our decisions and actions, then sure, it doesn't explicitly say that because we are still learning about the nuances of how the brain works. But to make the jump and say ""ah-ha, then it _must_ be supernatural!"" is just ludicrous.

We have a pretty good understanding of how our brains work. We have absolutely zero evidence to believe our actions or decisions come from anything other than our brains. Our brains are shaped by our environment and past experiences, and back on down my previously mentioned line of reasoning we go."

No it isn't, that is proof positive that the brain can and does change in response to stimuli and enzymes/hormones/etc.

> It takes a 'change' in chemical composition to bring about such changes in the brain. 

Not necessarily, neurons are constantly changing in response to stimuli, which changes the ""state"" of the brain. Psychoactive drugs such as THC can temporarily alter the behavior of the brain by (IIRC, don't quote me on this) making it easier for connections to be made through synapses. I'm not 100% that's the exact process, but it is something along those lines.

> Is your argument that the brain induces changes in chemical composition to then bring about a change in the brain?

I don't know if the brain actually produces anything besides electrical impulses, but it's possible that occurs. But no, the main source of change comes from the changes in neurons (again, from what I remember, I could be slightly wrong).

The phenomenon is called ""neuroplasticity"": https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity

It is literally how we learn and retain information.

DebateReligion,ffipax5,t3_etuj0y,1579979348.0,"I just so happen to have my argument for determinism saved for situations like this. I don't claim all atheists' believe this, but here are my thoughts on determinism:

1) The universe was formed at some point. Regardless of your beliefs, the vast majority of people believe the universe was formed at some point and had at minimum a functional starting point (ie., even if the universe is cyclically created and destroyed, it still has a functional ""beginning"" each time). This means that there exists a finite state of the universe that all future events can be traced back to.

2) Our actions are determined solely by the state of our brain and the combination of stimuli at that point in time. There is no evidence that our actions are influenced by anything supernatural like a soul.

3) The state of our brain is determined solely by our genetics, chemical inputs from the environment from things like the food we eat and the air we breathe, and sensory inputs over time. Each state dependent on the last.

4) The state of our environment is determined by an extraordinarily complex chain of events that stemmed from that finite state of the universe mentioned in (1). Organic life (including organisms with brains) and it's impact on the environment is included in that chain of events.

5) Since we haven't been able to prove any sort of outside influence by supernatural forces on the state of the universe or our brains, we are forced to conclude that determinism currently makes the most sense. And no, documents written by humans with questionable motives do not count as proof of anything - they are _at best_ weak evidence. Should future verifiable evidence present itself, the conclusion would need to be reevaluated.

EDIT: Figure I should add to this how ""free will"" comes in here. We still ultimately have the ability to make decisions, but those decisions are driven by our past experiences, knowledge, and preferences. There is no way we could choose something different than what we are predisposed to choose, but that doesn't mean we don't still make choices.

Furthermore, your actions will be shaped by whether or not you believe you have control over your actions. If you believe that you don't have power over your actions and therefore give in to your desires, your actions will be different than if you believe you do have control over your actions and thus try to tame your desires in favor of actions you conclude are morally just."

>Consider again an analogy to a programmer and a simulation. The programmer can use this trick to make ""others"" even though he is totally sovereign and functionally omniscient/omnipotent over the system.

>And therefore, determinism doesn't mean a micromanaging God, and because (we assume) God still wants to intervene a little bit to course-correct and stealthily build relationships, social interfacing becomes meaningful.

I think your programmer analogy is useful, but I think it actually counters your point instead of helps it. A human programmer is not able to predict the outcomes of running a sufficiently complex program, and is therefore not omniscient in any sense.

God is supposed to be truly omniscient which means he knows every possible outcome of every single starting state. Either he is truly omniscient and knows everything that could possibly happen, or humans somehow compromise this omniscience making him not truly omniscient.

However that doesn't make much sense because God knows our thoughts:
Psalm 139:1-4: 

> You have searched me, Lord,
    and you know me.
2 You know when I sit and when I rise;
    you perceive my thoughts from afar.
3 You discern my going out and my lying down;
    you are familiar with all my ways.
4 Before a word is on my tongue
    you, Lord, know it completely.

Sure you could say he just doesn't know our future thoughts, but God clearly knows when we our irredeemable - hence the various killings. So if he knows enough to know we are irredeemable he presumably also knows our future thoughts and/or actions. If he doesn't then he's just killing people based on his assumptions which...

The problem with ""socialism"" is that everything I've seen describing a socialist system is either incredibly vaguely defined, or still has capitalism at it's core with ""socialist"" ideas thrown in. The latter I could entertain, the former is unrealistic. 

To illustrate the core of the problem I see with socialism, I'll outline a few things:

1) You and others constantly use the phrase ""exploited for our labor"". I find this to be misguided, at best. 

2) If it was just as easy to organize people to reach a goal and turn a profit, why wouldn't more people just start a business? 

3) If you concede that it is harder to organize a group of workers than to simply be one of those workers, then why should the organizer have his efforts valued the same as that of the worker? 

4) If you concede that he shouldn't, then how is that different from capitalism?

5) If your qualm is with the distribution of the profits, I'd say that: 
A) Why are workers entitled to the profits of the work involved in organizing them? 
B) Such companies exist within the US: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/051316/6-successful-companies-are-employeeowned.asp . What is stopping you or anyone else from forming more similarly structured companies?"

If you're interested in CE, I'd probably recommend ATM though. As a CE (CS track) graduate myself, I got a great education and had a plethora of opportunities outside of my coursework. I got involved in a startup through a 48hr hackathon called Aggies Invent, which then ultimately led to my internship at a major tech company and subsequent full time offer. ATM has all sorts of such opportunities as an engineering focused school. I can't speak to UT's programs, but I'm pretty sure they also have a startup program and probably have hackathons and such as well.

Really though, I think you might want to give more consideration to culture fit, because college is about so much more than just classwork. If you prefer more liberal, city style life, maybe consider UT. If you prefer more laid back, suburban style life, perhaps consider ATM.
