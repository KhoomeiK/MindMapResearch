OrangeManBad,ffq8ax5,t3_etz6z1,1580125623.0,"Sure some people might find any or all of the aforementioned pictures offensive, but one thing that the right recognises that the left doesn’t, is that people have the right to be offensive, whilst at the same time people don’t have the right not to be offended. 

Be as offensive as you like, and be as offended as you like, that’s the beauty of freedom of speech & expression."

trump,ffcksme,t1_ffcjzt2,1579801572.0,"Agreed! It’s only when I looked back at Obama’s presidency in hindsight that I realised what a dumpster fire his administration was. I used to love watching Ellen growing up, and had no idea how biased talkshows personalities like her were until I stared watching and reading content outside of the mainstream media bubble. I used to be fairly centre to Center-left ideologically too, and then I woke up shortly before Trump was elected into office, and became wide awake after."
AntiSemitismInReddit,ffckdal,t1_ffcj2ub,1579801311.0,"Even baked beans on toast is better than ramen lol. 
Chuck some beans in the communal microwave for a minute (in a bowl, DO NOT put a can in the microwave). chuck some bread in the toaster you got for $5 at a Walmart, butter your toast with the butter packs you put into your pocket at iHop or Waffle House and dinner is done. If you’re feeling fancy you can sprinkle a little cheese on top and microwave some frozen broccoli or make a salad with some tomatoes, cucumber & mixed leaves. Doesn’t have to be fancy."

I hope so too, I feel sorry for all the farmers and wildlife that took a pummelling by the fires. Having said that, over 200 people have been arrested relating to arson & disobeying fire ban, so that’s a good start

And yeah, pretty much lol. Thanks :)
It’s ok though, he understood the risks of duty when he took the oath to protect & serve. Albeit I hope he goes into the fraud squad soon, as working the beat in the Midwest is not the safest of work environments."

Once you get experience with real world stuff  you’ll be a pro in no time. You just gotta keep your head above water for a few more months. Also; it helps if you try and budget for healthier foods, as they’ll help you concentrate better in class, compared to eating shitty ramen all the time lol."
