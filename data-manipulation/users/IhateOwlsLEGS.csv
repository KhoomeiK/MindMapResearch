It tends to scare men in relationships because I'm very secretive and if someone asks one too many questions or seems to care ""too much"" I literally recoil and hide. I'm just afraid that someone is going to use the information against me like my Nparents did, they'd assume me they'd be okay with whatever I told them. That it would just be ""between us."" But it always ended be used against me, or shared with my sister (who took after my Nmom) who would harass me about it.
