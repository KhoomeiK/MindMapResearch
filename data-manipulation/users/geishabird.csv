Fairly recently I was in a discount retail store and there were a bunch of twin-sized super-soft fleece blankets for sale on holiday clearance. I couldn’t stop touching this one that had an obnoxious pine cone pattern on it. I bought it.

I brought it home, knowing it wouldn’t fit my bed and would be too big for a casual throw blanket for the couch. Plus it was tacky as hell. 


The first night, after a good washing and drying, I went to bed and shoved it under the covers with me. I bunched it up and hugged it like a stuffed animal. 

This was about a month ago or so. It’s improved my quality of sleep 100%. I have an anxiety disorder which often causes insomnia. Now I can’t sleep without my blanky."

I remember laying on my bedroom floor at maybe age 6, and noticing how my carpet wasn’t really blue, it was dozens of different color fibers that from faraway created the color blue. Then I started thinking about how pictures of the earth from space were always blue....

My family moved to a different country every two years until I was 14. I got really good at saying goodbye to places I loved, and making sure they always stayed a part of me."

I don’t have kids, I admit this video is super adorable, but yeah, I don’t want one and I’m not wondering why others do. I’m glad they do! I’m happy being the cool aunt and keeping my clothes poop-free.


Edit: I recently introduced my nephew to De La Soul and I’m like some kind of hero to him now"
nostalgia,fffkxvf,t1_fffcmme,1579886199.0,"I think this all the time. I went to high school in the 90s; the “cool” 12th graders didn’t eat in the cafeteria at lunch, it was more hip to use the vending machines placed around campus. Every day of my senior year my lunch was a Nestle Crunch bar, a can of Coke, and a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos. 



I don’t even like those things now! Now as an adult, “eating badly” is like spending $15 on a fancy cheeseburger because I’m too lazy to make food myself."
