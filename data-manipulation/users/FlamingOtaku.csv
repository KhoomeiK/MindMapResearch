When it comes to the news, crime is particularly sensationalized if the perp is anything other than white. White school shooter? A misunderstood loner who was bullied, and never got the care he needed. School shooter of basically any other race? Violent criminal who deserves death for this heinous act.

It's the same crime, fuckheads. All this does is further racial tension, when we *SHOULD* be helping each other, showing that everyone is different in some ways and similar in others. Nope, it's just constant racism and bigotry."

Don't bother doing work, actually get sleep, end up without what you need to graduate, become a pan-handler. 3. Try to do all the work, realize you need sleep, stress kicks in knowing you didn't get everything done, can't sleep until it's late at night, wake up 6-8, rinse and repeat, end up sleep deprived.
