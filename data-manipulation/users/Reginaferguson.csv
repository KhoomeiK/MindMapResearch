The upside of walking with her was no one asked for money.  I could definitely have made a fortune selling her as a wife to someone though!!   Everyone called her Shakira :)"

clevercomebacks,ffieuiv,t1_ffg2omq,1579972186.0,"You have it with a crumbly cheese, but normally you make fruitcake that doesn't have icing with a glass of whisky.  It's delicious if the cheese is good (normally would use Wensleydale) as the salt / sweet and booze all mixed together is delicious.  Especially after a rich meal like what you have at Christmas.  

As someone who has worked all around the world, I would argue UK has a lot of the best food in the world if you have the money and an eye for good restaurants/cafes/pubs, but the food is terrible if you're poor."

To be honest that is my thing so I think its awesome and I actually think average guys/girls look super hot when dressed up in pants/lingerie etc.  Being submissive i actually get 10x more action than a lot of the guys as I am like a small horny rocket.  I am not offensive and most guys like to see me shag their date before they bang me and its totally not gay as I am trans...!!"
traps,ff5m014,t1_ff5bdo6,1579599494.0,"Ball gag, dribbling on myself over the gag, on webcam while people comment.  Bright red lipstick, slutty clothing and knickers.  Did it last night, laid on my back in front of cam and put my legs over my head.  Started pushing my dildo in and out quickly and literally sissygasmed all over my ball gag and face.  The people watching my cam where either wanking or laughing.  its the laughing that really makes me explodes god knows why!"

todayilearned,fdjo1se,t1_fdj5aga,1578480277.0,"But often the best way to achieve your goals isn't necessarily the moral way forward.  Its like when companies restructure every few years and all the employees complain that management is incompetent as this happens every 5-7 years.  That isn't true, the whole point of restructuring is to keep the cost of your labour down and remove any deadwood.  

If you left a large company static too long it either fills up with deadwood or the employees get clever and effectively start a competing slimmed down business that will out compete you on specific services/products."

interestingasfuck,fc6i10o,t1_fc47sgi,1577481055.0,When I first moved to the UK I walked into a barber shop and asked him where I could get my pants taken up and also where I could buy suspenders.  He couldn't stop laughing :p (in the UK pants are underwear and suspenders are what ladies wear to hold up there stockings).
WhitePeopleTwitter,fbywmqw,t1_fbxx3ci,1577228333.0,Isn't that what a conveyencer is for?  Also in cases where it's not clear in the UK you can take out an insurance policy that covers the potential loss of value.  Really common for access issues with old properties.
