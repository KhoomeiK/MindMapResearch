meirl,fejewbb,t1_fehzlrj,1579170792.0,"You are so close to understanding but there is a large aspect that you've gotten mixed up.  

You understand that there is ""real depression"" and there is ""fake depression"".  

You understand that one of them is the kind of depression that is justifiable, easy to explain, easy to imagine in your head and makes you want to give the person a big hug and tell them that everything will turn out okay after a reasonable amount of time and healing. 
Then there is the kind of depression that looks gross and icky and makes you want to slap the person and say ""Snap out of it, there is nothing wrong with you. You're being an asshole! Do something you lazy fuck, stop being such a loser!"".  
  
I don't think you understand that the second one is the real one.  
  
People ironically call out people for thinking mental illness is glamorous when it isn't, but when they see it for themselves they refuse to believe that they might not like what they see. You're not stigmatizing ""fake depression"", you're stigmatizing the reality of what depression really is.  
  
I know that might seem a bit confronting or cause a bit of cognitive dissonance, but keep in mind that feeling great sorrow and misery during times of loss and/or hardship is *normal*. Depression is a *disorder*. Depression needs a name change, honestly because *feeling* depressed and *being* depressed are two very different things."
