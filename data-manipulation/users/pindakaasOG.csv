But even then, the hospital's here seem to be nicer and cleaner than the UK. They are more accessible. There are lots more police about. There is a government app where you can apply for your benefits (if needed) without even leaving the house. You can report your moving through it. You can report neighbourhood damage or needed repairs. The country is clean etc also. I can make positives about many types of infustructure here.

The fact the in NL, if you needed help, you can apply online for your benefit, get an instant decision and start from that day, is 100% better set up than in England. In the UK, you ring up. Go on hold for hours. Get an appointment 2/3 weeks later. That happens to be 20 miles away. You have to pay to get there. Then waste hours. Wait about. It's beauracracy in its finest form. And it sucks. (I never needed it, but I know people who have)

facepalm,fd4z0w3,t1_fd4xdud,1578172576.0,"You should do some research mate.

1) the Netherlands are using more advanced trains than the US. Which can both auto operate long distance and be manual driven. They have double decker cartridges and high speed tracks linking you to Paris, London, Berlin, Switzerland amongst others. Sprinters to small towns. 

2) between Amsterdam, den Haag, Utrecht and Rotterdam. You can go city to city in under an hour with nearly 20 trains an hour. 

3) you can go from the very top (den helder or Groningen) to the very bottom (Vlissingen, Maastricht) within 3 and a half hours. With no need to change. Or if you do. Only once or twice.

4) Schiphol is the 2nd biggest airport in Europe behind LHR in terms of numbers.

5) rotterdam, den Haag and Amsterdam have trams covering every aspect of the cities combined with busses. you don't need to walk more than 10 steps anywhere ever if you really didn't want to.

6) everywhere has cycle paths

7) there are electric charge points in pretty much every city and multiple smaller locations.

8) busses are  more green and cheaper 

9) small towns have train stations with 4 trains an hour and sometimes the towns are the size of UK villages.

10) big cities have multiple train stations covering zuid, centraal etc. (Amsterdam alone has 11 train stations).

11) if what I read is true. There are 420 train stations in NL. Not including trams, metro. Buses. And on a day to day basis. There are 55000 trains running in NL. 

11) there is metro/underground in Rotterdam, den Haag and amsterdam. And the Randstad network connects den Haag, Delft, Schiedam and Rotterdam in a 16km network.

12) there are multiple international coaches a day to. Germany, Belgium, UK, France, Poland and others

13) Boats! Wether it's small river crossings (AMS centraal = free), city to city down the river (AMS to zandaam) or international cruises. You can go from AMS, hoek van Holland or Rotterdam 

I can keep going. The only valid point you can make back is NL is smaller. And that's true and the only reason NL can do what it does so well."
