Luckily, Major League Rugby play union, not league (as confusing as that might be), which means you actually get Canadian and American players on the teams, along with much more local engagement."

todayilearned,ff4jpqs,t1_ff4698z,1579565268.0,"I'd also want to add Dan Carter, as the All Blacks' flyhalf. With 1598 career points and two Webb Ellis trophies in 112 caps (a lot, sure...but hardly the most even for a flyhalf), he's ~350 career points ahead of Johnny Wilkinson, who's hardly a pushover himself. And that's hardly all kicking points; he has 29 career tries, which is really exceeded (in terms of the list of all-time highest scorers) only by Matt Giteau and Beau Barrett...both of are part-time flyhalves at best, and often play inside centre or fullback. Carter's numbers will probably stand for a very, very long time."
