AskReddit,fgihyhm,t3_eypu9w,1580822188.0,"My sister and I shared a room for about two years. We have always been super close but still fought over the stupidest things. My sister wanted me to leave the room so she could FaceTime a friend, but I was playing on our ps4 so I said no she can go somewhere else. Then we started yelling then I said she is in my personal space and she moved two steps closer to me so I screamed you’re breathing my air. We fought for two minutes about who had the rightful ownership of the air in our room.  (I was 12 she was 16 at the time)

My mom came in and the next week we moved to a 3 bedroom apartment"

AskReddit,fgbe438,t3_ex4dz9,1580661195.0,"At my apartment building there were short lights along the pathways. They were probably three feet tall. 

I was taking my dog on a walk and the night before it had rained and it got really cold in the morning. So the path was a little icy. As I’m walking her she sees a lizard so she runs to it. Then she realized she was about to run face first into the lights along the path. So not being able to stop herself Bc ice and not wanting to hit her head she turns her body around and just... booty bumps the light with so much force that she knocks it over. With the power of the butt she knocked over a three feet tall street light."
