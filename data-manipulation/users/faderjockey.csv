WTF,ffc5aoo,t1_ffc49bi,1579791861.0,"False.  You can buy drywall screws in any length from 1/2” all the way up to 3” and beyond.

And length has very little relationship to holding power, unless you spec a screw that’s vastly too short (barely penetrates the surface material.)

The length of screws should be selected with the thickness of the surface material as the first consideration.

The reason why drywall screws have such less holding power than wood screws is that they are made of a very cheap and fragile kind of pot metal, and the screw heads shear off really easily.

Source:  I build with drywall screws every day.  I’ve sheared of hundreds of heads, sometimes just by hitting a dense knot in a piece of lumber."

Acknowledging and elevating someone who was instrumental in helping correct those mistakes, making her a figure as significant as one of our past Presidents, is a way to acknowledge our past and show some respect to those who risked their lives and fought for what was right even when it wasn’t easy."
