movies,ffqdkve,t1_ffqajbn,1580131344.0,I forgot Bambi could even talk until I watched it again also. The only thing I remembered from it was Bambi in the field of flowers playing with thumper.
starcraft,ffqd7y9,t1_ffq1acy,1580131006.0,Wait what? Then why...? Bw kerrigan definitely had some more sass.
MadeMeSmile,ffqc9ps,t1_ffq20kx,1580130071.0,Well he's smiling for one. And the phone probably has some beautification thing that smooths out the faces. Most Asian phones have that set as default.
MovieDetails,ffozp9u,t1_ffmuewo,1580083698.0,Yeah Maury is the guy that deals with crazy families.
ManyBaggers,ffnbmxb,t3_eu9znt,1580064042.0,"I don't do Kickstarter. I always wait til they can provide an actual product instead of donating money in hopes of receiving. There are a lot of good bags and stuff that come from ks, but it's not worth it for me. 

Good luck with your bag tho."
EVERGOODS,ffjflqa,t1_ffjayfm,1579997216.0,"Gadsden. Va here, so I see these everywhere. I like this snek version."
AskReddit,ffj6w5h,t1_ffikqkz,1579991899.0,"My grandfather had land in Seoul, but had to sell before the boom and the price skyrocketed. My aunts complained and said that they would be millionaires if he held on. 

He knew how valuable the land would be, but said he needed the money then to support the family or else they could be on the streets. He never regretted it. Sorta like no use in crying over spilled milk."
EVERGOODS,ffiunfa,t3_etrz9i,1579983152.0,I love that patch tho
manga,ffez0cw,t3_et858j,1579870912.0,Man the reactions are so good.
plsnobulli,ffexzkn,t3_et9d25,1579869931.0,Hmmm....

They said they weren't restocking the black one on Twitter."
ManyBaggers,ffc0mnx,t1_ffb6yyc,1579788492.0,"Yes, why do they do this? I always have to hope that there are reviews that actually have photos of the interior. I only need to see back and side profiles of a person. Show me what it looks like inside!"
AskReddit,ffbzmph,t1_ffacvx0,1579787707.0,"Ahhh, that explains why it looked like it was dying. The structure was just old and decrepit. 

No wonder I felt the same with Kmart. It just seemed like it was dying. The yellow fluorescent lights and super old fixtures, paint, etc."
backpacks,ffbz20p,t1_ffao4gr,1579787255.0,"Got a black one for Christmas. Didn't know they sold out and aren't making anymore. Guess they are phasing it out? Seems weird they aren't keeping this pack around, since they are pretty great."
Thatsabooklight,ffbyuvf,t1_ffbypji,1579787093.0,The first image caption says that the prop Dept probably borrowed from the set Dept. Which makes sense.
Games,ffbwi8o,t3_eskhwx,1579785078.0,"I bought it on PC (for me and also for my wife), switch, and mobile. It's just a great game."
nextfuckinglevel,ffbtgex,t1_ffboc2g,1579782125.0,"I believe this is true for my wife. She never had the opportunities as a kid and started in high school for cello. No training or lessons, but became first chair. She loved it, but parents weren't onboard with the whole thing and couldn't afford better cellos or lessons. She really loved it, which was the shame. 

Then again if she actually made it big with music, I never would have met her."
ManyBaggers,ff7egmh,t1_ff7e41i,1579647667.0,Lol yeah. Am I missing something? Normally these posts would be about trying to id a bag
POTCmemes,ff4hfis,t1_ff3zri8,1579563688.0,"It was a lot of wasted potential. It was also surprisingly boring for me. I watched it on a flight and was excited to watch it, but it was very dull. Jack is the protagonist in this movie and the two younger ones (I can't even remember their names) are like a side couple following Jack. They made him too washed up and worthless. Writing seemed pretty lazy too."

manga,fey22tu,t1_fex0xk4,1579439705.0,Seriously underrated on r/manga. I happened to read it based on the comments and I was so glad I did. Yugami is an amazing character.
manga,fexw76c,t1_fewwv8k,1579437482.0,I didn't need this at 7 am
netflix,few10c8,t1_fetdlxf,1579403939.0,Not everything has to be like 80s action films though. It's fine to have easily digestible schlock. This is McDonald's rather than a steak.
Moviesinthemaking,few0i6q,t1_fevsjgs,1579403728.0,I feel like the YouTube version loses a lot of the facial details. The eyes and the mouth especially. It cleans it out too much and you lose whatever subtle faces the actor makes.
