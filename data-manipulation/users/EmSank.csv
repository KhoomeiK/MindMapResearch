corgi,fek2d4h,t1_feju7ay,1579191133.0,Yes! Bert is on Instagram!
corgi,fejtoui,t1_fejt74j,1579185604.0,"Bert is about 5 months old too! We had the same issue at first. He was afraid of the machine but he liked the output. We usually would sit next to the machine and just throw the ball and he would bring it back. Then we would put the ball in the machine and he would bring the ball back to us. Every once in awhile he would drop it in by accident and then we would cheer and praise him.

Even still, he wont play with the machine by himself if we aren't in the room. We have to sit there on the floor with him. It's a slow process but super cute to watch."
corgi,fejr8dt,t1_fejr56q,1579183838.0,He usually stands right in front of it and tries to catch it as soon as it comes out. He is successful about 25% of the time.
