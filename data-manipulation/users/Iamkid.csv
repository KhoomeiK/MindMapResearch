The two terms in RL most commonly used to describe footies style are shadowing and faking. 

Instead of attacking or waiting for the opponent to attack you bait the opponent into rushing and wait for them to make a mistake. Then you counter once they are completely unable to defend."
knolling,ffqwn6v,t1_ffqsp9u,1580145319.0,"It’s way to steep for produce, especially avocados. 

You always stack the most ripe avocados on top and most people  will tend to buy avocados of different ripeness. So people tend to grab some from the top and bottom which would cause a nice avalanche in OPs case. 

The produce is faced beautifully and won’t need to to worked for the rest of the day but it’s not very practical for the customer."

In that case flip resets should be nerfed, wave dashing, half flips, and so on.

RocketLeague,ffhcjlj,t1_ffh1u8w,1579929902.0,"You’re not asking a question. You’re presenting a “social problem” and is a discussion that may never have a definitive conclusion. 

So the best you can have is a discussion which should have neutral bias. 

But if you start the discussion about an unsolved social problem by saying you are right then you’re obviously going to have a bunch of people that are going to tell you why you’re wrong.

Edit: Just want to say that I agree with you and wish “cross-progression” and cross-inventory were real and find their absence to be anti-consumer

RocketLeague,fffbu5k,t1_fff72v8,1579880520.0,"110 FOV is a good standard but personally feel 107 FOV works better for me since I use 1.0 stiffness with a higher distance. 

If someone is using 280 distance with .40 stiffness than 110 FOV is perfect. 

But I prefer 310 distance with 1.0 stiffness so the 107 FOV personally works better. 

To each their own and agree 110 is most likely the best place to start."

However I believe the item was from a summer event and you could only acquire a single miyagi-do during the event so they could be a little hard to find. 

Unfortunately I’m not willing to give mine up and wish I had an extra for you. 

I would suggest going over to r/rocketleagueexchange to ask for a [Price Check] to see what it’s worth then try putting up an offer to see what you can get. 


Best of luck."

RocketLeague,ffbviba,t1_ffbsmv5,1579784160.0,"Wait wait wait.. so your complaining about people not finishing CASUAL matches?!? 

If so than this is nearly 100% user error. 

The #1 thing you need to do when in a casual 1v1 is to communicate! 

You can even communicate through quick chat to get a feel for how the opponent wants to play. 

The majority of people in casual 1v1, especially at higher casual MMR, just want to mess around and free style. 

If you are tryharding on someone that just wants to shoot around or free style than that is your fault for not properly communicating with your opponent. **CASUAL** 1v1 is by far the most casual and is more like a 5 minute freeplay with another person. 

If you want to play full 1v1 matches than go into rank, rank up a bit to find opponents equal to your skill level, and play against them. 

Stop complaining about opponents leaving in casual immediately because there is no warrant for an argument since you’re obviously in the wrong playlist."

If you go to the Rocket League page on Twitch Flakes will be easy to find since he has about 1k viewers watching him at the moment. Aaaaand he’s using the Merc! Flakes is the only player to ever use the Merc during RLCS gameplay. He’s a lot of fu to watch."

RocketLeague,ff9e2v4,t1_ff9drtx,1579711011.0,"I would suggest watching Flakes on Twitch. 

He’s a Pro RL player that just got signed to FC Barcelona that streams everyday and he uses different “ugly” looking cars and absolutely destroys other plays in them. 

It’s a lot of fun to see a top player not give a shit about what kind of car he’s using and just plays the game for the fun of it."
RocketLeague,ff9dnfm,t3_ese5mi,1579710728.0,"Here’s a suggestion that will help even outside of Rocket League. 

Try not to be so *impressionable*. 

If you are impressionable than that means you are easily influenced by other’s opinions. 

Some people are just trying to help but most people are simply telling you what they are thinking which may not necessarily be the truth. 

Take what others have into consideration but also have your own opinion on the matter. 

Using the same car as everyone else will not make you any better."
