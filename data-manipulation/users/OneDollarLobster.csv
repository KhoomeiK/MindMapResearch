Survival games are a different genre. You say ""look at the different server options"" but fail to see the difference in the servers? You run your own mmorpg servers? You create rule   sets for your mmorpg servers? No . Why? Because it's a permanent living breathing world that you can become a part of.  Survival games are not built that way.

The only thing that needs to happen is hardware manufacturers need to increase their specs, which is already happening, and software developers to notice that the market share for chrome os is substantial enough for them to give it a shot.
