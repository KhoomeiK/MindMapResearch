fatlogic,ffakljt,t3_es9tum,1579738079.0,When I was fat I was also depressed and had poor hygiene and didnt care how i looked so am I mental illness phobic for being embarrassed about how I looked when I was in a dark place?

Anticonsumption,ff20ola,t1_fevf5ah,1579490677.0,Yeah it's a fad the same way wearing jeans and a t shirt are a fad.

IWantToLearn,fewai3c,t3_epxjw4,1579407569.0,For me taking pills with seltzer rather than still water seems to make it a lot easier since the bubbles mask the weight/existence of the pill which is what used to make it hard for me

Anticonsumption,fen9dl5,t1_feka7r6,1579279818.0,"My friends mom taught me when I was like 14 haha. It's come in handy especially after learning about anticonsumption, minimalism + frugality, it's like a triple punch of saving money, getting a much higher quality product and having a productive/creative hobby. enough decent-to-high quality yarn to make something often costs about as much as a comparable cheap crappy fast fashion piece... it's like, would you rather pay a huge corporation $20 for a crappy acrylic beanie that will be trash by the end of the winter or would you rather buy a beautiful $20 skein of hand dyed yarn from a local yarn store and knit yourself a much nicer hat that'll last forever?"
Anticonsumption,fek3ea4,t1_fdwj0v7,1579191764.0,"I shop at trader joes a lot and I've always appreciated that they sell really good quality canvas bags for a few bucks each, I use mine when I'm not even shopping sometimes because it's sturdy af and holds a lot of stuff."
Anticonsumption,fejzm5k,t3_epcpo3,1579189435.0,"My stuff holds up pretty well. If we're talking about things other than basic t shirts and underwear and things, I have only a few fast fashion items at this point, just a few professional looking blouses. I take decent care of them and don't wear them all that much since I'm in college and dont work in an office. Most of my clothing is made of natural fibers and secondhand/vintage, most of my winter accessories are things I knit myself. Wool seems like a PITA to take care of but it's really not that bad unless you manage to get actual stains and such on it, it mostly repels dirt and takes a long time to get gross. while you do have to hand wash it, it's a pretty rare occasion and really not that big of a deal, I put a lot more effort into washing regular laundry."

My new roommate is a med student (whom I met after losing everything) and likes to randomly ask whether I might have something she studied despite not knowing my history and it's weird and annoying and kind of anxiety/hypochondriasis inducing"
fatlogic,feiw1ol,t3_ep4l2t,1579148760.0,This is true if you already eat very healthy but not true if you're part of the 90% of the population that eats a lot of garbage. I don't mind eating a chocolate bar once a week or so because those 200 calories dont mean shit when your diet is reasonable the other 99% of the time

fatlogic,fdzy806,t1_fdzujad,1578798715.0,"I'm the opposite tbh, I spend less time cooking than I did when I was fat but tend to buy things like those salad kits they have because it's easier than making one from scratch.

fatlogic,fdzqpqn,t3_enbs4z,1578793609.0,I never followed someone else's instructions or a fad diet... I learned the nutritional values for each food I eat and started to incorporate things I like that are healthy into my diet more while reducing the amount of garbage I ate. If people took the time to do that they would succeed more than if they just follow some stupid fad diet that prescribes certain meals that you must eat

fatlogic,fdfer4n,t3_ekyc09,1578359977.0,I've only owned one cat my whole life but the idea of a cat getting fat is so foreign to me like my cat will randomly refuse to eat a certain food even if she liked it the day before and then wont stop meowing until you give her something else.

raisedbynarcissists,fccympl,t3_egy6cw,1577604217.0,"My mom has piles of clothes she never wears because shes too lazy to wear anything other than sweatpants and flip flops until she needs to impress someone... and she makes fun of me for only wearing clean and presentable clothes out of the house. It's the weirdest fucking inversion of narcissism I've ever seen... I don't get dressed to the nines nor need to look perfect, she just mocks me for wanting to wear clean, appropriate clothes that look decent together when I leave the house???"
Anticonsumption,fc75qfv,t1_fc74dni,1577498260.0,Real people had to design everything that's in a factory made product. If you have the skill and want to make it a joke there's no harm done.
