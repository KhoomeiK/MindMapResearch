I found myself having a lot of trouble too, restarting a lot and so on. However I found that going lone wolf with a summoner companion and a 'knight' worked out incredibly well.

Honestly, act 2 is the best part of any game I've played in nearly 2 decades, I was so engrossed in the world I forgot everything around me, and that never happens to me.
