Also, they have a bonus channel so even if DCU and another team's game overlaps, the game can be hosted elsewhere."

Inside the stadium, we're all mixed together (tho 136 is more Barra/Ultras and 137 is more SEs).

We tailgate with the SEs because our annual fee pays for unlimited pregame beer all season, and the deck on the Anacostia is nice. But inside Audi, we stand far more amongst Barra because theyre louder/rowdier and that's what we like."
