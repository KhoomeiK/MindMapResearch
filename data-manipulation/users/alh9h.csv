StudentLoans,fenfrn2,t3_eq3q7f,1579283738.0,"Your loans have most likely been sold to a debt collector. You should check the NSLDS to see who now owns your loans and contact them. If they are Federal loans, you can do loan rehabilitation to get them current and then put them on an income-driven repayment plan."
Cruise,fenbbu7,t3_epyy99,1579281026.0,"I've used Alaska Cruise Transfer (ACT Big Bus) twice and they've been great. They do a narrated tour along the route, or for a little more you can take the one that stops at the nature center"

StudentLoans,femoyst,t3_epsjr3,1579265205.0,"I'm not sure anyone here can speak to Canadian loans as this sub generally has a US-focus. I would suggest posting in /r/PersonalFinanceCanada or a similar sub.

For US loans the amount is supposed to go towards tuition and living expenses, not your car and personal debt. Do you have any equity in the car? If so, sell it and buy something cheap."
StudentLoans,femo7af,t3_epvbd6,1579264449.0,"Personally, I would put it on your parent(s) to figure out. Through their avoidance and ignorance they have saddled you with what is a mortgage payment in many parts of the country. I absolutely wouldn't pay any more than what your original payment would have been. Since they have done a Direct Consolidation, they can put the new loan on income-contingent repayment which might make the payment more manageable (depending on their income)."
StudentLoans,fel4dd2,t1_fel3gn4,1579213798.0,"Just put them on an IDR, pay the minimum and get the rest forgiven."
PSLF,fek87js,t1_fek7gx3,1579194643.0,"No, the loans do not have to be consolidated. The loans must be Direct Loans paid with an eligible plan (IBR, ICR, PAYE, REPAYE or 10 year standard), while in qualifying employment. The only time you have to consolidate is to make an FFEL loan into an eligible Direct Consolidation Loan."
PSLF,fek4yuh,t3_epkhq0,1579192713.0,"No, you can ask to recalculate or switch at any time."
PSLF,fek4vpr,t3_eplgh6,1579192660.0,"Doing a consolidation loan ""resets the clock"" on PSLF as it is a new loan. So what you should do is keep them separate. Your first loans will get forgiven after 120 payments and then your graduate loans will get forgiven after 120 payments on them."
PSLF,fejupx7,t3_epk89h,1579186288.0,"You can do this, just remember to go back on a qualifying plan (IBR, ICR, PAYE, REPAYE or 10 year standard) when you return to PSLF-eligible employment. 

One other thing you might consider doing is switching your tax filing status to Married Filing Separate (MFS) and using IBR or PAYE (if eligible). If you stopped working, your income would be $0 and your IDR payment would also be $0. 

It has never been true that if you left an IDR plan you couldn't go back on it."
StudentLoans,fejsr8c,t3_epjwhg,1579184943.0,"Yes and no. This would be a shocking amount of student loans to take out for undergrad and/or graduate school. It would be a fairly normal amount of loans to go to medical school or on the very high end of law school tuition. To put it in perspective, a $200k loan will require monthly payments of \~$2200 for 10 years to pay off. This equates to a pre-tax salary of around $35k. The 2019 median individual salary was about $40k. You would only have $5000 a year to live on if this was the case."

Then put all the Federal loans on income-driven repayment. At your income you will have a $0 payment. Ideally, you would find Public Service Loan Forgiveness-eligible employment, but if not your loans would be forgiven after 20 or 25 years (but the amount forgiven would be taxable)."
StudentLoans,feia8ov,t3_epaf93,1579133784.0,"Just call and tell them you want to do rehabilitation. It is a federal program and they have to let you do it. After 9 payments your loans will be rehabilitated and you can put them on income-driven repayment. You will have to provide documentation of income. Your payment will be very very low. If you are single, your monthly payment will be like $15/month. [https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/default/get-out](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/default/get-out)"

StudentLoans,fehz177,t1_fehu2lf,1579126744.0,You apply after 5 years. I would call your loan holder and ask for forbearance based on the CFR I cited
StudentLoans,fehtob6,t1_fehs2c1,1579123654.0,Except that section (i) specifies annual forbearance for each year. Section (ii) is referring to the forbearance you get when you make the final application after year 5
