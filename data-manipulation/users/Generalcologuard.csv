But saying that you're only up for sex with people you've formed an emotional bond with is basically the rudiments of love.

I mean, I guess it needs to be explicitly stated bc of the dominance of hook up culture, but I was listening to an interview with Peggy orenstein and this isn't that unusual, even for men, it's just that masculinity gets in the way and men aren't supposed to be emotionally connected to sex.

Besides what's the point of having a spectrum of sexuality if we're supposed to nail EXACTLY what describes what we're into in one term? Isn't that the opposite of sexual liberation?"

Remember, Clinton lost the election having won the popular vote by a few million.

Question.  What do centrists and moderates and undecided voters think of Sanders?  That's what's important if we're talking electability.

As a footnote, it is very telling that Republicans were worried most about Joe Biden, so much so that they pursued blackmailing a foreign country by withholding aid to do so.  An action that led to Trump's impeachment.

Listen and listen well.  Sanders is a dream opponent for Trump unless the economy takes a sudden turn.  All he has to do is tell people that he's going to tax you more, that will knock undecideds and moderates off and to the right EASILY.  Also bear in mind that the poor racist Podunk white folks voting Trump into office is a myth.

If you work very hard you should document what you do and try to find some non-assinine way to describe it on your resume.  My experience has been that if you give 110% over time that will be seen as your normal load bearing capacity.  I've been given employee excellence awards, discretionary bonus', twenty dollar gift cards, etc, but the only way you get a raise for what you're owed in this environment seems to be to take your skills somewhere else and when they ask for your salary expectations you add the raise you would have asked for at your old company.

I'm not kidding, I'm literally working for at least another person right now and it's insane, bc you'd think that management would see value in paying someone that can do that 5 or even ten dollars an hour more as being a good investment and overall cost savings.

RedditForGrownups,ff26pti,t3_eqwpuv,1579495370.0,"I don't envy kids growing up with social media.

I was not popular in high school and even my friends would often ditch me and go out and not tell me.

Having to see that for real and not just assume it was happening would probably have destroyed me way deeper than it already did having shitty friends.

It's way easier to obtain knowledge and research things.  I can look up a video on YouTube and get a reasonable sense of how to do something on my truck or to my house.

I sat betwixt the rise of PC's and the internet, so one more thing I'll say is that my parents just don't have the skill to navigate the internet/detect bullshit.  They are extremely vulnerable to disinformation bc they come from a time where the gatekeepers were real and the only place to get their particular brand of how America works was only available though a subscription to the John Birch society and am radio.  Now they have non stop echo chamber and it has made speaking to my mother about anything remotely political completely off limits.  

Also you have no idea how much effort it took to go somewhere you weren't familiar with or even get a ride home in high school.  If my mom was late or didn't answer the phone I would sometimes end up jogging six miles to get home.  

Ironically, I feel like kids don't often use the internet to it's advantages.  My sixteen year old surrogate son will be like, ""were studying feudalism in class, what's all that about"" and I'm like ""there are maybe ten well produced short primers to checkout on YouTube"" and then they won't do it.

Design a process or a task so that it eliminates the possibility of certain problems arising.  It may take more time effort and money, but long term the payoff is that you're not constantly having to hire someone whose sole job is to make sure people comply with proper procedure.

The other component of this from the standpoint of the person in charge is to actively listen to complaints and understand how a person works when they're not being supervised.  If your operating principle is micro management you will most often fail.  A micromanager can have eyes in the back of their head, but a good manager has as many sets of eyes as he has employees.

And here's the third and probably hardest point that needs to be followed: incentivize compliance.  If someone follows what they're supposed to do don't act like ""you see, this is how you're SUPPOSED to work"" as if it's a given.  Because you KNOW by now that good employees who project their experience and a culture of compliance are rare.  It can be a pat on the back or you take them into the office and let em know.  

So few workplaces do any of these things and then they marvel at the Byzantine ways people will go to the effort of finding in order to cut corners.  And then they're surprised when the next hire does the same things.

It's not for nothing to bear in mind that our last successful push into space was not actually a star trek-esque ambition to push the boundaries of human experience beyond the planet of our origin (as it is often wistfully remembered retold in movies featuring heroic, selfless, heroes with singular progressive purpose)  It was constituent to fueling technological dominance over another super power we were locked in a cold war with--the center of which revolved around development of accurate and overwhelming delivery of weapons whose portent was the lingering threat of a conflict that would end human civilization as we currently know it.  (Edit: forgot to mention that at the heart of this conflict were two competing economic systems that were diametrically opposed to each other, capitalism and neoliberalism being crowned the winners)

The idea that we might expand into space under the banner of the future survival of humanity is witlessly naive.  Under the current paradigm it would have to benefit a few very rich people and make them even richer.  We need to stop hitching our wagon to the idea that the salvation of humanity somehow inexplicably runs parallel to a system of hiearchy that follows profit like water flows downstream."

Like, until you're presented with the facts of racism, for instance, and see the problems of race as pretty central to all of American history, you're likely to watch, say, remember the Titans and be assuaged that racism has been solved and that nothing you do is bad or is in any way supportive of the stuff you just scoffed at as repugnant.  And you know, actually, you're actually nothing like those evil people in the movie because you don't recognize them in yourself.

This is the kind of thing that makes ""all lives matter so effective"" and the same reason people going to breakfast and lunch directly after church are the worst people to serve.

unpopularopinion,fd3jq4f,t3_ejwtxj,1578158992.0,"Having spent a decade on Reddit and having been white myself and having white friends and family who fall in the politically conservative side of things: this is a fairly popular opinion.

When white people invoke color blindness it's really just an affirmation of privilege itself.  Being white means that you don't have to be aware of your race because it's not a constant issue in your daily life.  That's not saying it's NEVER an issue but likely it's not a constant negative in your life, and it's not constantly butting its head into your daily affairs.

So when the idea of colorblindness is used it's really just trading ""in your face"" southern style racism for ""behind your back"", shit eating grin, northern style racism.  (Chief Justice Clarence Thomas prefers the former btw)

Being colorblind or thinking you are won't end racism the same way ignoring signs of an underlying illness won't make it go away and likely ends up making it worse.

As a white person myself, part of coming to terms with what I was taught in high school was reconciling the fact that acknowledging that I had privilege didn't mean that I alone was solely responsible for the entirety of bad things that have happened because of racism.  You're taught that racism is bad, but hey, it was handled, and now things are in an even keel.  You think, ""I'm not a bad person and I don't go to Klan rallies or condone lynching, I was in the black mans side while watching to kill a mockingbird, I even have black friends, so I can't be racist and this is preposterous and rude to even associate me with it!""

White guilt isn't a thing that black people created to make you hang your head in shame, it's something YOU feel when you're suddenly confronted with the consequences of systems you had no hand in putting in place and were never truly taught to understand were foisted upon you.  It's the resentment you feel when people who should have been responsible pass that responsibility to you.

And now you have a choice.  Now that you've seen that the skid marks on the road lead to an accident down the hill you can try to help, or you can keep on driving your car down the road and convince yourself nothing happened and if it did, there's nothing you can do about it.  You didn't cause the accident and you have no obligation to fix the outcome.  White guilt is your nagging conscience that won't believe the lie you told yourself so that you could go on with your life pretending nothing happened.  You can at least call 911 and say that something happened.  Some people are better at believing their own lies, but that feeling of indignation, you know, when you have an argument with your significant other and later realize they're right?  That inability to concede?  That pride?

That gives racism a nice warm spot in the dark to keep on thriving.

And THAT is what colorblindness really is."
Futurology,fd3acaj,t3_ejw94e,1578156322.0,"I would like to point out that it doesn't really matter.  Climate change is a global change requiring global action and it's more of a freight train with momentum at this point.

Much like the American political situation, drastic action isn't going to perturb the systemic problem.

Given how the last worldwide existential threat to humanity went (global nuclear conflagration set off by the world's two superpowers, with incidents in between that nearly ignited circumstances that would lead to it either due to mistakes or accidents or outright posturing) I'm not optimistic."

Remember that author that was plotting for the resurgence of the Soviet Union.  The Tehran alliance?  Link that together with Trump's really out of left field abandonment of the Kurds, and why replaced them?  The Russians.

Trump could be made to comport with Putin's wishes in any number of ways, but my money is that a review of his tax returns would inevitably find that his funding is flush with the money of Russian oligarchs.  All you have to do is convince Trump that this was his own idea, that you're great friends with him because look at all of that financial support and voila call him brilliant for coming up with it afterwards.  You don't even have to extort or blackmail him, he's so effectively molded by stroking his ego that all you have to do is aggrandize his actions and backdoor in your ulterior motive."

politics,fcsiqk7,t1_fcs7e5f,1577917274.0,"I think the turn against this being an extension of biology is that within capitalist systems there are certainly learned and inculcated ideas and behaviors that undergird people's behavior--by claiming something is natural you are left nothing to contrive to alleviate the behavior.  That are no other options worth looking into because this j is just the inevitable way this tends to work.

This is one of the assumptions of laissez faire capitalism, that it most easily comports to natural human tendencies.

My counter to natural arguments is simply to ask a person to describe anything they've done, say today, that could be said to be truly natural.

So, back to this argument, the counter would be something like ""that generation also wasn't denied participation and relative success enough to convince people, that whole not ideal there was something to the idea that worked as intended.

My argument is that millennials don't have that same level of easy access."

They make you feel like you're in on the whole thing, make you feel confident and safe in that you know what's REALLY up.  The thing though is that the more you get into them the more and more powerless you become.  As you go deeper more and more lovecraftian modes of ultimate control are listed, more and more convoluted plots are revealed, and they are always revealed in the post mortem, none of the supposedly powerful knowledge you or your ilk have gained can even nudge the system from being implemented unimpeded.

Unlike knowledge of real conspiracies.  The mechanic brings a dirty air filter to show you just how dirty your cabin air is, but you know this one, and decline or call them out on their bullshit.  You know that the speed limit suddenly drops off in a particular area and a cop hides right behind that billboard, so you slow down right before and avoid a ticket.  You know how much a coworker with similar seniority and experience gets paid, so when you get lowballed at the negotiation you politely decline and find work elsewhere with an appropriate salary.

The Clinton's are assassinating political opponents and running a satanic pedophilia ring, so you decode the bread crumbs on 4chan and elect Donald Trump, who is secretly waiting to drop a string of indictments on them and stop it, nothing happens.  Must be the deep state again.  It's always the deep state.  Nothing happens.  You know what's up but you're powerless to do anything about it and a sitting duck for anyone who wants to pretend to be in on it with you long enough to take advantage of your trust.

You see, believe it or not, some of us on the left are critical of our choices and the performance of our selected political candidates.

I have yet to meet a Trump supporter that can even imaginatively entertain something specific Trump could do to sour their support of him.  

Btw I while I don't agree with Trump's unilateral approach to China I do believe that they do need to be made to behave on the world stage (this would have been better handled through something like the TPP), thought his assymetrical approach to North Korea, though he has yet to follow through with it, was the right way to go, and the missile strikes on Syria for using chemical weapons were spot on.

However, the number one thing about Trump that he cannot reconcile for me at this point is that he is utterly opaque with his business and financial records.  He is eminently corruptible because of them and I'm not giving him the benefit of the doubt.

Also, his child separation policy was cruel, unnecessary, inhumane, and totally at his discretion."
