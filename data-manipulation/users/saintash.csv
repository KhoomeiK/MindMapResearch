AskMen,ffgqr7h,t1_ffghao6,1579912668.0,"Honestly I think it's more the fault of the last season and he promise of the first episode that the will they won't they end up together is broken by the ending. 

It was a very interesting concept to have them not end up together. And that was brought a lot of people in. 

Then they spend a whole season basically stating over and over again. Barney and Robin have staying power as a couple And is Ted finally over her. 

It was a much more powerful message for a show over all storyline when he doesn't get the girl. 

Instead it looks like Ted gets a woman to push out a few kids conveniently die So there is no broken home And Ted get to hook up with the girl of his dreams with semi grown children so she is off the hook raising kids. And it make it look like kick ass Robin just sat around waiting for him. 


If they were like in there 70+ it bee less upsetting they ended up back together cause what ever they had a life and meet up again in old age. 

But it just come off more like they wanted to have them end up  together all along with promising they won't."

I have extra crock pot, markers for children to color with a bunch of manga. From my high school years they are in great condition.

I do however make 11.50 an hour and two implants I need for my teeth so money is not something I can really give some people that are hurting.

AskReddit,fdpth8y,t1_fdnhrro,1578639834.0," I know what did it for me. There was an off hand comment by burnie on a podcast. Talking about frustrated he was at time because they internet makes posting only 'good things about their lives' 

And it dawned on me that as a company. They did that. They presented constantly as we are all buddies and every always is perfect working here.  And it's all play and drinking. 

When the first big animation at rooster teeth is a problem came out there was a part where that person said something about there was tensions between how Monty worked and how RT wanted him to work. And if you go back you can hear the occasional comment that implies that's true. 

And you can tell some times they don't want to be that they want to the serious  company they are.. but goes so hard against the brand they can't break out of it.

AH used to be fun to watch now it feels like they are constantly forcing the wacky and fun."
