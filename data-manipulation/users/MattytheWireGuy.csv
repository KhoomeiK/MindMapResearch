He just says, well somethings cant be fixed and this is your only option.

EDIT 2 Heres the email I sent about that

Im writing this to you after calming down after our phone call to explain and describe both how Im feeling and why I have been doing the things I did. First thing I notice when the medication is wearing off is a distinct cramp/soreness in both knees, this is my basic indicator that I need/should/want to take more medication. This is not a sharp pain, its basically the same feeling in you knees after doing a bunch of squats or leg presses; a dull soreness on the sides of the kneecaps and on the thighs right above the kneecaps. If I dont take it when this happens, there is about an hour befor that cramping moves up my thighs and down my calfs into my ankles.  At this point I am uncomfortable enough to be woken from sleep or drive straight home from wherever I am to get my meds if they arent with me.  That uncomfortable feeling turns into serious anxiety within two hours of this.  As soon as the anxiety starts, my lowerback and abs start spasming making it harder to breath.  One of the worst things that happens around this time is entirely restless legs and cannot sit still for more than a few minutes. Laying down or sitting with the recliner footrest up makes it even more uncomfortable.  Sleep is impossible and the only way to deal with the restless legs is to pace the house or walk up and down the street endlessly.  
Note at no point is my hip hurting yet, that happens after the spasm thing starts and more I think about it, I could be pinching my own nerves causing pain.  After years of conditioning, if my knees feel anywhere like they do when the medication wears off, I immediately take medication to stave that off, not for any rush or head change (there is neither) just to make sure that my knees dont feel that specific type of soreness. Its uncomfortable on its own but not serious, but it is a mental harbinger of things to come.  I cannot tell you if that feeling is caused by lack of meds or actual knee pain, but the methadone does make it go away so I dont take chances. That is until this month and last month.  I basically spent days in a constant state of withdrawal shoveling pills in my mouth trying to make it go away .  It didnt stop with the new prescription for December although it was better, but just.  
Im describing this as clearly and step by step as possible so you understand where Im coming from and why Id be inclined to take more medication than alotted.  I do know know that the brand of medication is not the cause, I am still experiencing the sore legs tonight taking the West brand methadone.  I dont know WHY this is happening and why it hasnt subsided but I can assure you its not an attempt to abuse the medication in a stupid attempt to get a buzz as even double dosage doesnt even come close to what even a typical norco does . 
 I may be getting ahead of myself about just up and quiting my meds, but I may not be off base either or may not need as much as I take, but I can flat out say that the feeling in my knees is the one and only reason for taking more medication.  If I could address that I dont think Id feel the need for the excessive medication I was taking (Im guessing an extra half pill per day on average).  Per day, that doesnt seem like much but it obviously adds up.  This doesnt seem to happen when its warm so I can only guess that temperature does play a part in it.  
I hope you may be able to identify somethings in there that could be addressed with non-narcotic medicines (like the aformentioned knee pains) or understand better how the pain progresses in my body and what I mean when I say something feels sore or sprained when its obviously not, just feels that way. I do have a desire to make a change, opiods have controlled 1/3 of my life and while I definitely needed them 10-13 years ago, I have no idea if that pain exists only as a side effect of withdrawal symptoms as I only stopped taking medication a few months after my hip replacement and have never stopped a long time after like now.  
Again, I hope this lays out as clearly as possible my motivations and feelings that not only tempt but flat out force me to take have been taking more medication than necessary; its half fear and half conditioned response to an impending  amount of doom and pain I cannot explain to others that havent experienced it."
