Next, I do have a few things that come to mind to add on with what everyone else has already submitted:

1. If you stop at camps with sewage hookups, *do not* leave your waste valves open all the time. You don't want your black tank gases migrating into your gray tank.

2. Your tanks drain better with some pressure, so keep the valves closed and just pull one at a time each evening (if hooked up to sewage). You'll want to drain black first, then close it and then drain the gray (the gray will essentially rinse the hose of black water waste). This order of dumping the tanks is a good rule of thumb every time you dump.

3. Rinse your waste hose after you dump, when you're ready to pack it away! Obviously this should be done outside ;) 

4. Check your tanks often (fresh, gray, black). The last thing you need is to boondock somewhere and have a full black tank, and an empty freshwater tank lol.

5. Let your generator exercise for at least five minutes before tossing a load on it. Start it up and let it get good and warm before using heavy amp items such as the microwave, hair dryers, HVAC, etc.

6. The oven. lol First timers usually don't know that most RV *gas* ovens need to pilot for ~30 seconds before they will let the flame pass through to ignite the rest of the tube. You need to open the oven door fully, turn the knob to ""pilot"" and then push the knob in manually, and use a match or long stem lighter to ignite the pilot under the heating panel inside the oven. After it lights, you'll need to hold the knob pushed inward for about 30 seconds *before* you attempt to raise the oven temp. Otherwise, the flame will just go out :)

7. If you are dry docking without freshwater hookups a lot, consider taking Navy showers. That is, you rinse, flip the shower head nozzle to off (most can do this, and it's easier/different than just turning off the water entirely in the tub), soap up head to toe, flip the nozzle back on, rinse off, then you're done. Really reminds you of how spoiling regular showers are :)

That's all I got for class C. Have FUN!!"
