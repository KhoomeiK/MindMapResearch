Yes. Duh. Making your own money AND having people provide for you and cater to your needs is a dream. Who tf would reject free resources? Yall tripping. Life is freaking hard and I ain't saying no to free food/money. Men lie ALL THE TIME in order to get pussy. Women don't sit back, arms crossed, waiting for men to be hOnest.

PurplePillDebate,fegpqo5,t3_ep2w9j,1579099623.0,Men very much understand the difference between normal flirting and sexual harassment. Any woman who believes otherwise is naive and needs to wake up to reality.

islam,fdfq3tu,t3_el4o0d,1578367507.0,"I think masturbation can lead to zina (fornication) which is why it's not allowed. The Quran teaches us to not go near zina (full verse 17:32) We are taught not only to avoid committing zina but to also stay away from it. Masturbation can tempt us into watching pornography, which then weakens the iman and makes us vulnerable to other sins."

islam,fdf6ny9,t1_fdf20ya,1578354535.0,"Yes I agree with you. A few muslim feminists want to change/abandon the Quran and its bad, however his article reads as another rant on feminism. ""Feminism is bad bc blah blah blah"". Not once did he address the underlying issue. He wrongly thinks women are leaving faith due to feminism when really it's the bad treatment and the abuse (from men/ the community) that push them away. Feminism isn't a threat to faith.. far from it."
islam,fdf1xn4,t3_el1bo9,1578351449.0,Muslim women wouldn't be drawn to feminism if men didn't abuse/ignore our rights. Simply put. Stop giving women reasons to follow liberal movements.

islam,fdcj67m,t1_fczx2g0,1578276209.0,Women are allowed to go to the mosque whenever it pleases them. Everyone who attends the mosque should be given the same access/opportunity to learn Islam. Forcing women and children to go to another room and only giving them a poor audio of the lecture is borderline sadistic. I mean have you heard the guy's story or..?? We can be better than this.
