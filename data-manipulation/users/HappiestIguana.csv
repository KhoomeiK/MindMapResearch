Bossfight,fedt9nx,t3_eolmic,1579019413.0,Every 10 points of damage you deal gives you -1 karma. So this is a good fight to take if you're going for the evil ending. Otherwise either avoid or use an instant-kill move like headshot since that doesn't trigger the penalty.

weatherfactory,fc9ladb,t3_egrm35,1577554364.0,"As far as I know. AK was critical of the business direction of the company.

He has also stated that he had a different creative vision for the game. He conceived the High Wilderness as a place human minds were not meant to comprehend, and so in-game you would navigate metaphors the mind creates to make sense of the place. He also didn't intend for London to be transported to the High Wilderness.

You can see some of this vision in the end of the Merchant Venturer's quest and in how he deals with Salt, Frostfound and Kingeater's. This are the things and places in Sea with a strong connection to the High Wilderness and yhey are caked in metaphor and stuff the human mind cannot fathom.

That said, I do not believe he has criticized the creative direction Skies took in the end, just said he had a different idea."
