canadaguns,ffgjyaf,t3_etehop,1579907963.0,"I've tried about 15 types of sabot shells in my 870 with 18.5"" rifled barrel (basically I buy a box whenever I see a type I haven't tried). I can understand how it's difficult to choose one for hunting because they are all so different.  I find the Remington Accutips are the most accurate, but I have heard they do not expand at all <50 yards. I may have also heard this about the Remington copper hollowpoints.   


If I was deer hunting I would probably go with anything from the Hornady line: SST, Superperformance, or American Whitetail). They are 300gr and 325gr. Honestly, as expensive as they are I would put a at least a few shots down-range and make sure they make a decent group. Shoot a range you would be mostly likely to hunt, especially if using iron sights. Different barrel brands and lengths treat slugs differently. Add to that the wide variety of sabots and you have 3 significant variables in performance.  


For moose I would go with a .30 cal hunting rifle personally but I don't know ranges you're hunting at."

Now when I have someone in the car for a long drive I scroll past Howard at a low volume and try to hear what it is. If it's an interview with someone good I turn it up. Even though most fans can't stand his interviewing style anymore an interesting/funny guest makes up for it and is usually compelling to a nonfan. Listening to Lenny Dykstra tell stories makes the drive go super fast.

But if it's any intershow drama it's pretty much unlistenable to anyone not familiar with the show. Likewise most of the wackpack material is kind of awkward as it just seems exploitive to a nonfan. Wrap up show is a definite turn the channel (even when I'm by myself lol).

guns,feihhfw,t3_eoounz,1579138641.0,"I have a Marlin 1895 SBL and have had a few Henry's of other calibers. Henry's are much smoother than Marlins IMO. Also while the Marlin quality has improved the last few years, it still isn't at the levels of pre- Remington/Cerebus/Freedom group takeover (2007). Henry's quality is generally better and their customer service is top notch. Also they just seem to have better QAQC. You may get a mint Marlin, but people still seem to get lemons here and there.  I haven't heard of anyone getting a shitty henry out of the box, but I'm sure it happens.   
Hickok45 has a video comparing an older JM-stamped Marlin and a recent Marlin that may be of interest to you. And I am sure there are plenty of Henry-Marlin comparison vids out there.  


Pros for Marlin: cheaper and side-loading gate. But now Henry has a side loader (I think in 45-70?).  Also I find the Marlins just look more badass. Basically I think if you were going to buy a Marlin, I would handle it in the store first. Make sure it feels right, there's no obvious visual defects, the sights are aligned, etc.   


The 3rd option is finding a used JM-stamped Marlin. Plenty around, lots in fantastic condition and I'm sure you can find the right deal out there."

Shotguns,feel3x9,t1_feegono,1579035946.0,"I wouldn't stress a bit of refurb/restoration. Honestly the ""DON'T TOUCH IT"" sentiment has turned into a bit of a circlejerk at this point. Yes restoring a historically significant piece will usually affect the value, but this is an heirloom SxS.  You are not selling it. It did not belong to Ulysses S Grant. It was not at the Battle of Little Big Horn. It is not 1 of 500 1911s made at a factory in Quebec. It is a sporting arm. Yes it may be rare, but there were a million SxS producers in Europe during this time period.

Not only this, but from my discussions with collectors of fine English SxS shotguns, it actually is quite common to restore even rare and significant SxS in a tasteful and historically accurate way. Re-stippling and polishing the stock, re-rust bluing barrels, redoing colour case hardening, repairing damages are all very common in the SxS world, particularily England, Germany, Belgium, France etc. The obsession with leaving it as is is largely American, and generally directed at historically significant military arms.  


I noticed you posted this on the canadaguns sub. If you'd like a link to a professional restoration guy let me know.  It's not a crime to want this piece to look it's best. A pro restoration can turn this dusty heirloom into a work of art.

That said, it is a personal decision so it's worth it to do some research and have a think about it. As for the barrel markings there is quite a bit of online resources for barrel proofings. Just google 'french barrel proof marks' and you'll probably find a lot. As for shooting it, you'll want a light load in 2"" or 2.5"" (double check the chamber length with a gunsmith). This won't be found in your typical gun store. I've been recommended RST brand which I was told is sold by Prophet River (Cdn company).

CanadianInvestor,feee7ku,t1_fedegk5,1579031928.0,"Not to be rude but you should probably know this stuff before you start even trading. The main way that companies share material information (information that can affect the share price/perceived value of a company) is through 'news releases' or 'press releases'. If something drastic happens with the share price the first thing one would do is check the news releases. These are listed on a company's website and just about every website that lists stocks. For example, if you look up NMX on Stockwatch ([https://www.stockwatch.com/Quote/Detail?C:NMX](https://www.stockwatch.com/Quote/Detail?C:NMX)), you will see a section that says 'Recent Bulletins' that lists all the companies recent NRs.

Seriously if you gave someone that cared the Stern archives I'm sure they could put together a week's worth of content together in about 1-2 days of work. 101 should be 8hrs of archived material, rerun twice over 24 hours.

The Ronnie ones are ok just because it's so easy to rile him up. But then they take it too far and stretch it out to 15 or 20 minutes of hammering the same points. 5 minutes of Ronnie yelling are enough for me.

Yeah I'd say a big reason for the difference with the US (other than population) is because the most popular modern firearms, AR15s, are restricted (range only) which really reduces the market for them here.  It's a pretty arbitrary classification too because tons of semi-auto centerfires are non-restricted (mini14s, ACRs,  vz58, sks, xcr, b&t etc).

There's a good forgotten weapons video on Cooey if you're interested in the most prolific Cdn mfg for civilian market. There's also vids for most of the military firearms; Inglis hi power, Ross rifles, C1a1 (Cdn made FAL) and a few others."
guns,fcamyb0,t1_fc3imey,1577572449.0,"Very few. 

-Diemaco which made Colt M4/M16s for Cdn armed forces and civilian market was bought by Colt some years ago but still manufactures under the name 'Colt Canada'. Great reputation for quality, especially the barrels. Pricey, though. $2000-2500 CDN for full AR-15 setup. 

-There is Black Creek Labs formerly North Eastern Arms which makes AR-15s, AR-10s and accessories. Not a very good reputation.

-Kodiak Defence makes an AR-180b clone which is a budget friendly non-restricted rifle (won't bore you with rules, but basically non-restricted you can shoot in the bush, restricted is range-only.) They also made a VZ58 clone which is also a popular non-restricted rifle here. Mixed reputation.

-Savage 64s (semi-auto .22) are made in Canada. This is a Cooey design, then a company called Lakefield bought the tooling, then was sold to Savage. More about Cooey below.

-Alberta Tactical is a smaller shop that makes well-regarded AR15s, AR10s, and custom precision rifles for civ and law enforcement. 

-Dlask is a small custom shop which makes some AR lowers, 10/22 clones, SIG P228 clones, and assorted barrels.

There's a few parts mfgs here as well but I think this is it for actual firearm mfgs. 

Former Mfgs:

-Cooey made single shot shottys and bolty .22s up to the 1970s. They were bought by Winchester in the 60s I think and then was Cooey-Winchester. These were very budget friendly and just about every Canadian gun owner has one in their closet. 

-Para Ordinance 1911s.

-Longbranch made Enfields, Stens, Boys anti-tank rifles and other stuff in WW2. Lots of Longbranch Enfields around here. You can get the anti-tank rifles as well but they are like $8k. The Stens are prohibited I think.

-Inglis made Hi-Powers in WW2. These are good shooters and go for $1500 to $3000 for collectibility. Pretty sure the military is still using these, no joke.

-Ross Rifles, pre-WW2 military.

-Tobin sxs shotguns made 1910-1915 can still be found as well. Nice collector pieces, some really nice engraved models. Tobin made them originally in Connecticut before moving to Ontario so there's probably some of these floating around the US.

edit: lol just realized this post is 2 days old but hope this is of interest to you."
