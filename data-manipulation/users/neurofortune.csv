Enneagram,fe6r40x,t1_fe2wxho,1578901435.0,"Hahah I actually barely fuck w/ MBTI, I don't know it with my heart like I do enneagram- and I also dk whether I'm actually INFJ or INTJ? You seem to be more into MBTI than me though. 

If our wings lie some distance between each other's though, our similarities might not be as marked? Not to mention instinctual stackings.

And hmmm yes 7 seems to be a pretty different type from 4, eg. in its inherent extroversion/aggression vs 4 introversion/withdrawal, + their respective tendencies towards negative emotions (leaning towards intolerance for vs a slight proclivity for).

From memory, 2 was my most unlikely type? Makes sense. 1) I feel uncomfortable with overt emotionality, (especially if it's not out of 100% genuine care), and 2) I strive for self-awareness, in contrast to people who might be terrified at the possibility that they might actually hold a hidden agenda re: their love + care for others. 

(This is in reference to unhealthy 2's though- the 2's I've met have been genuinely kind and caring. However, it's a 6 tendency to be attuned to *any* sign that something doesn't match up, such as in this case, behavior + true motive...)"
Enneagram,fe6prf7,t1_fe3ei61,1578899714.0,"That sense of difference has also always been a constant in my life, but admittedly for different reasons in different time periods, (eg. social exclusion as a child vs lack of common experience as an adult). 

Yeah, for me, I'm obsessed with those moments where I explain something that either I've experienced, or that someone else might be experiencing, and they go 'ohhh I get what you mean' or 'ohhhh how did you get into my head?' 

When I'm misunderstood (or my attempts at explanation are met in a cynical/argumentative/apathetic/confused tone), though, is where you'll see an intense sort of agitated frustration appear in someone who's usually quiet and unproblematic. 

I also like being able to articulate (to myself) the exact way in which I differ from others too (not to mention the numerous other facets of my personal experience/theories). This isn't for the primary purpose of basking in it/amplifying it (in that typical sorta 4-ish way). 

It's moreso for clarity, and a sense of being able to use it to defend/explain myself, in the possible case of someone demeaning its credulity- ""what are you talking about, you're not, like, different from anybody else, I think you're overthinking things, I don't get what you mean"". (I hate these sort of statements.) 

In summary, a lot of my 5 wing goes towards fending off potential attacks/misunderstandings on/of my credulity/personal makeup/inner experience. In addition to feeling like I can never comprehend it all (in regard to real-life fields of knowledge), I also feel like I don't even know where/how to fit this knowledge into my personal framework for life? Like it doesn't attach to anything I'm currently concerned with? 

* Basically, if 5's are concerned with building a framework for (to assist with the goal of competence in) **real life**, (*oh gosh I gotta know everything to defend myself against possible real world threats*), then
* 4w5's *may* be concerned with building a framework for (to assist with the goal of competence in) **understanding the self**/the nature of internal worlds (*fk I gotta know who I am, I gotta be understood, and only then can I function; only then can I have security in how* ***I*** *can deal with things in the world)*. 
* (It occurs to me now that a simpler way to put it is that- to respond to the challenge ""**I** will survive in the **world**"", 5's focus on knowledge about the **world**, whereas 4w5's may focus on knowledge about the **I**.)

Iiiiiin other words, it's interesting how- 

* to relieve the anxiety of feeling like one can't be capable in the real world, **5's** may obsessively *develop theoretical competency + understanding of real-life fields*, whereas
* to relieve the anxiety of feeling like one can't *develop theoretical competency + understanding of real-life fields*, **4w5's** may obsessively develop a greater understanding of the self's mechanisms. 

(These are sorta oversimplifications, but it's true for me (strong 5 wing) anyway...) 

No problem for the responses lmao also yeah leaving it for a few weeks is probably a good plan. Especially since there's no due date by which you have to figure out your enneatype, it's just bonus knowledge in your life. Good luck w/ both ennea-things and getting through the breakup/associated personal predicaments tho x "
productivity,fe6moqr,t3_enjw95,1578896175.0,"This is good stuff, I mainly use 90m intervals when studying, but for 2 different reasons- 1) I'd always go over my timer if I set it to something shorter (60 or 75 mins) which just ended up disrupting the intended rhythm, and 2) if I was feeling lazy, I could shorten it down to 60 mins to make it more palatable to me. But it's slightly different from how you use it to focus on a *single* important task in order to get it done for the day, I suppose \~ 

However- I feel that this (whiteboard + single written objective) will be helpful for some other side projects I have my eye on ! I suppose it's precisely because you are your own boss for your own projects/pursuits, and you can take it in any direction you want, that this anxiety occurs. In comparison, I don't find it as bad when I'm studying for uni, because there are set structures and objectives to meet, and the endpoint is generally defined."

Enneagram,fe18bs0,t1_fdwoyqc,1578823681.0,"Re: 4’s/identity/difference, this is a hard one since the breakup is a modifier. (I hope the trajectory of your recovery is straightforward though x)

Your quote though, “i’ve always known that I am fundamentally different than anyone else”- could be a subdued expression of the whole 4’s-and-identity quandary/complex that so *characterises* 4s? If you could remember the *place within you* (that, presumably, has existed for as long as ""always"", as you mentioned) that your quote above came from, and then compare it with the 4w5 statement below, then they could possibly match up in mood/tone/energy? (You’ll  see that what concerns me is not ever really being \*heard/\*the lack of inherent commonality with others, whereas if you were core 5, it’d be a different core concern\~)

* For me (4w**5**), this identity complex was in the form of an **I-Know** statement with subdued energy. “**I know** that I am different from others. Apart from surface-level commonalities in experience, I know that what is core to me has not actually been experienced by you. I know that we could listen to the same music but not end up really hearing the same thing. I know that if I were to speak to you like how I speak to myself in my head, that you’d make a confused expression and say, “I don’t really understand”. Or that even if you truly made an effort to understand, that this is no substitute for us having shared the same experience (albeit separately)- so that what I am saying *strikes your chords* with respect to this specific experience. So that we instinctively know what we are both referring to. That no amount of explanation and listening can replace having experienced the same thing. And in this regard- experiencing and thinking and feeling, more or less, the *exact same thing*\- that *this* is where we are different.”
* Whereas the *typical* 4’s-and-identity quandary is more commonly expressed in a **3**\-ish way, that being, an **I-Don’t-Know** statement with undertones of frustration and longing. “**I don’t know** who I am. I don’t see where I fit in, or that I have ever fit in. I feel like myself when I take on this or that persona, but then it doesn’t feel quite right, and I don’t know which persona I am, or whether there is a real me. I want to know the real me. I hate not being seen. I wish they could *see* the real me.”

(Any 4w3/4w5’s want to weigh in re: the accuracy of the above 2 statements? I wanna know whether I've gotten the general sense of the difference, and if there even is a distinct difference. Also, they’re not paraphrased from an external source; I don’t want to be an incorrect ‘original source’...)

Re: incompetence- From a personal perspective, it annoys me that I don’t know how to be competent in certain real-life/practical fields, those being computing, DIY, workplace survival/etiquette, finance, law, etc- and that I feel *helpless* to even try. I think that if I was a 5, I wouldn’t feel this *barrier* between frustration/incompetence in these fields and then actually *making* the effort to develop competence. Maybe you have this barrier if you’re a core 4, but less so if you were a core 5?

I feel this barrier partially because I believe these actual fields are boring (yawn), and partially because my 5 wing only goes towards what is relevant to me (personality types, psychology, self-improvement, etc). In other words- I only give a shit if it concerns *me*, but the sphere of things that concern me expands in proportion to my health level. (Which makes sense, as when healthy, 4's feel a greater sense of connection to who and what surrounds them.)  Whereas a core 5 may be more comfortable studying fields that don’t directly concern them (puzzles, chess, X obscure field- eg 16th century medieval pottery), while still keeping an eye out for the inherent art + beauty in these fields, if that sounds like you.

But only you know about which fields you want to be competent in, what the barrier is behind you developing competence in them, whether they bore you, whether they relate to you as a person, and whether you want to be competent so that you can *defend yourself against the world/be prepared once threats and challenges appear/have a personal stockpile/framework of theoretical knowledge that gives you a sense of assurance and relieves anxiety* (5)- or *know more and more about yourself/develop your own personally relevant concepts and theories/take on an image of effortless worldliness + competenc*y (4)."
getdisciplined,fe0s1fb,t3_enk8il,1578817979.0,"This is so true tbh, clinging to the so-called innate 'quality' of an action without reference to whether its trajectory matches up to the desired destination. 

You're right. For me (in the past), it wasn't about wanting to reach a certain destination (through my actions), it was moreso about the feeling of *relief* after ticking off as many boxes on a tasklist as possible. 

Thus, after every action/task, I'd feel relieved/proud not because it got me any closer to a defined destination, but because I felt I wasn't 'wasting my time' or dilly-dallying. That I was 'on the grind', so to speak. That if I made any sort of effort, then this would absolve me of the possibility of 'failure' (whatever that means). 

But the thing is that once you have your destination in mind, you can use both 1) the feeling of progression (towards it) and 2) the satisfaction of exertion, to both feel good about making an effort + to know that your efforts are actually effective and meaningful. 

I guess it follows that the next step would be to *define* your destination(s). Which, actually, I might go and do right now (for all the arenas of my life). 

Your post was helpful\~ ty x"
getdisciplined,fdu3n3k,t1_fdtxadq,1578726950.0,"That explanation + the videos makes a *lot* more sense now- how it's not about the statement/confession itself, but about the courage to face remorse about the hurt that you've caused, and then feel that hurt right to your core, before you can begin to make up for it. 

It's heavy stuff, and it's not an aspect of self-improvement you can 'tick off the list' like making the bed, cleaning your room or beginning a new habit. That stuff is so easy compared to this. Even though a lot of people's consciences would agree with the importance of confession, I don't think many people feel, at the current moment, that they are ready to go through with it. But it's the first step to acknowledge that one should do it in the future when one is ready, I suppose, because you have to really face (and not *just* list) your own sins before you truly move forward."
getdisciplined,fdtviti,t1_fdsmkyi,1578722885.0,"Yeah- the 'pain confrontation' I did was actually trying to figure out some underlying pains/fears/worries that were related to this particular feeling of constant *unease* that I had. This unease made it more difficult to function, whether it be studying or relaxing, as I subconsciously knew that I was performing actions that wouldn't actually  *fix* these core problems. I felt that these actions were meant to contribute to my 'progress' as a person, but I didn't *feel* I was progressing in these core areas. These included worries about emotional distance from my parents, as well as feeling like I was unable to function as a human being outside of my chosen field- like if I wasn't studying what I am now, that I would be useless and awkward and unemployable and unsociable, and I wouldn't belong in the world.  

However, with self confession, I haven't really felt the need to do it, because I don't really have regrets in my life. This is because I'm lucky in that nothing I've ever done has had legitimately severe consequences. Instead, I put a lot of effort into examining the underlying reasons behind the unhealthy things I've done, because that sheds light onto the *subconscious mental patterns and beliefs* that we all have (but may not be aware of, especially at the time of the behavior). In other words, I do identify my 'sins'- but the real task (to me) is looking underneath these 'sins' to find out what the *real story* is. And in the story is where I find true meaning. 

But other people's lives are different- so self-confession might be more relevant to people with more overt and life-affecting problems, such as procrastination/binge-eating/anger issues..."

It also sounds like the points written in the '4' section relate moreso to who you are/what you feel at the core of things, whereas the '5' points are more peripheral aspects of *how* you go about your life. 

Also- you mentioned some core 4 fears, namely, identity concerns + the feeling of fundamental difference- whereas you didn't explicitly the core fears of enneagram 5 (competence + helplessness). 

Lastly, I've heard that wings are the *means* by which we go about achieving our core type's purpose- in other words, that we *use* our 5 wing to meet the core desire of ennea 4 (discovering our identity) in the form of constant research into the Enneagram itself. So another argument for you being a 4 is that the 5-like research is *secondary* to the primary 4 *purpose*.

As you said, admitting to your flaws + acknowledging our current reality can be very difficult for us. Every time we turn away from this, our conscience also alerts us- but we're so used to ignoring our conscience already that we keep on ignoring the alert !

But honestly you could be any other type. I get what you mean with how some test questions could be answered on either side of the scale, depending on the context.

overcoming,fdmkif5,t3_elyq1n,1578553313.0,"Greetings from Australia \~  I read your whole post, and while I don’t have a lot of ‘advice’ per se, but maybe a thoughtful response will suffice. 

It sounds like you were such a pure child when you were younger !! Other kids can be so horrible when they’re younger, because they haven’t developed a conscience yet; I experienced bullying as well when I was at that age. The second school also seems to have diminished your personal autonomy, and that wasn’t OK either. 

It also sounds like you were really anxious when you were taking the IQ test, which would definitely have skewed the results. But who cares if you can’t answer abstract questions, or make sense of arbitrary patterns? In the real world, people care more about whether you mean well for them- i.e. if you’re a nice/genuine person. And you sound like a genuine person to me. 

Your coping mechanisms aren’t too unhealthy, from an outside perspective. The two that stick out to me are working out and meeting friends, because they maintain both your physical health, and your self-esteem/social belonging. It’s fair enough that after all you’ve been through, that you stay at home a lot/watch porn/feel disheartened because you don't cook or clean. But they're still okay to do if it keeps you going, and keeping yourself going is all you need to do for now. 

But there are many steps that are possible to take from here- eg. applying for some other types of jobs, getting out of the house a little bit more, seeing another psychologist if this one doesn’t vibe with you, or beginning to take care of the household again. But only you know which one is right for you. If in the past, you were able to pull yourself up and start working out and talking to people, then maybe making another big change this time will be easier ?

Maybe it helps you that someone from the other side of the world has heard your story. 

I hope you don’t let all that’s happened, is happening, and may happen, get the best of you."
getdisciplined,fdmh5dh,t3_em4up8,1578549737.0,"hi- I was in a similar quandary before- but I find that digital timers/app restrictions are supposed to work hand in hand with having a strong sense of what you'd ideally like to do in that time instead. for example- if you imagined that your next weekend was the last one ever, how would you choose to spend it? even if it's not sustainable eg. fancy dinners/chilling at the beach- maybe you can cultivate a strong intention to do a 'lite' version of one of these activities, in this case, being cooking a fancy meal/going to a nature reserve. 

As you do find that it still has value to you- how about halving the time you spend on YouTube- but instead of spending it passively like before, how about actually setting out to consume it *intentionally*? what I mean by this is that currently, your usage seems 'passive' in the sense that you sort of let loose after work, find yourself opening YouTube, and then end up in a state of vague guilt/unease about 3 hours later. Intentional consumption goes along the lines of saying to yourself 'right! I've worked hard today- so I'm going to make myself a drink, get dressed in something comfortable, set a timer, dim the lights, and watch some YouTube for the full span of these next 1.5 hours.' You might be sick of it by the time the timer goes off, or you still might want to watch more, but that's okay, since no matter what, you're cultivating a habit of intention + allowing yourself to *enjoy* something that you value (in terms of relaxation, entertainment, education, or all 3 !).

hope this helps x"
Enneagram,fdmeksy,t3_em494l,1578547337.0,"as far as I know, paying for enneatype tests aren't a norm at all lmao, regardless of socioeconomic status (maybe others can confirm?)

anyway- it's interesting you've identified one type in each of the 3 centers (head, heart, gut), as this (614? 164?) could be close to your tritype. (see sidebar 'comprehensive guide to all things enneagram' for an overview of tritype theory- but don't worry too much about it now)

It's also normal to have difficulty discerning (from 2 or more types) which your primary type is- but the thing with enneagram descriptions is that each site/source has a slightly different take on each type, so your primary type may become more clear to you as you start to pick up on the common themes of 6's and 1's. [this](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/misidentifying-1-and-6) could also help you differentiate between the two. 

But once you begin to settle on your type (and even before this), being able to see aspects of yourself that you were never even fully conscious of, or able to articulate clearly, written right there on your screen in relation to a well-established enneatype is really... satisfying/relieving.

Enneagram,fdkqla9,t1_fdkpkzs,1578509096.0,"2) Creation

1. I think that musicians and writers would feel... really sad... if they knew that their art made somebody else feel discouraged/genuinely disheartened/that they were not up to the task. (Or if they don't feel sad, then they *probably* feel the same as you do too regarding art above their own 'skill' level). Since you play an instrument, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zvjW9arAZ0) should be quite relevant to you- it's in in the same spirit as this post, albeit a bit long. but at the very least, skip to 9:40 for a quote that made me v sad :\^(
2. If you look @ [this](https://www.complex.com/covers/lana-del-rey-interview-against-the-grain-2014-cover-story/) interview - there's a section at the start where Lana del Rey (4w3) talks about songwriting coming from ""*being in a good place*"". From memory- Van Gogh's (4w5/5w4) Starry Nights was painted during a period of *recovery* too? So it's *completely* understandable why right now, you don't feel that you *can* create, or feel *joy* in creating, because it wouldn't come from a state of personal and emotional stability/health anyway. But of course this isn't permanent, as health levels do fluctuate.
3. The period of time in which I wrote the diary excerpts above wasn't a good time for me. Writing felt even worse in a way, because I felt no matter how much I wrote about it or tried to describe it, nothing would change. That I was doomed if I did or didn't (write about it), as both roads- those being, 1) bottle it up or 2) verbally vomit- seemed to lead into the same spiral. 
4. So in summary, the spirit of creation ideally originates from a place of health, and naturally benefits both the creator/audience in a way that both are better off than if they were to never have created/appreciated the work in the first place. It thus follows that you shouldn't be too hard on yourself for not feeling like you're creative at the moment, since it can't be expected of *anyone* to produce (and *enjoy* producing !!) something of resonance, if it's coming from a place of genuine inner turbulence/despair. 

&#x200B;

3 ) negative thoughts

1. I think we both know that the statements which constitute all this obsessive negative self-definition aren't *objectively* true. Or that progress from here isn't a case of logically disproving these statements and then moving on, like you would with a scientific hypothesis. At the very least, if we saw these thought patterns in someone else, we'd suspect that there's more underneath the surface- perhaps some sort of anxiety, or maybe even that it's a vocalisation of underlying notions that can't seem to get out any other way than in the form of repetitive thoughts.
2. Maybe a reason we say it so obsessively to ourselves is because we so desperately want to *know* *that we* *know* something definite about ourselves, (even if it's *negative* (esp. if we're used to negativity !!)), because it's still fkn *something*. 
3. I guess the line of 'logic' that justifies these thoughts is that since works of art can be seen as expressions of what's inside- that if we can't produce something outside of us (in song/word/visual form)- that it means there *is* nothing inside. But an overheating computer can't function because its circuits are being overloaded, not because its hardware + software has disappeared. If you get what I mean. 
4. They don't go away overnight- but when these thoughts come up next, if you pay a certain type of neutral/curious/detached attention to them, it may help to think of the thoughts as like malware, or, to imagine physical rocks (with the particular negative statement written on it) buried deep down in your psyche (I personally think about them buried in dirt), or something else to your liking, such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/5hxs7x/a_tip_i_stumble_on_this_month/). I find it naturally removes whatever credence they may hold, and helps configure these thoughts as deceptive and pathological, but *ultimately removable.*

Also- when you say 'filling the roles of others'/'not allowed to express myself'- are these roles to do with you as a friend/at your job/family member/student? or something like not having enough time to yourself because of what you *need* to do (for others), or something to do with strictness and conservatism, or that you feel others won't be receptive to your 'true self' which lies behind the role you have to play ?

I'll throw a few discrete thoughts out here

1. Originality
   1. The concept of originality is often interpreted as being able to ""create/synthesise/observe something that *nobody* has *ever* created/synthesised/observed before"", which undoubtedly puts a *great* deal of pressure on those who are inclined towards this particular interpretation of originality. It seems to conjure this vision of peak four-ness as, like, arising from mythology as an ethereal, forest-born one-of-a-kind, for which art and expression seems to come intuitively, and as their birthright.
   2. The negative side of it is that one may have to live their life being *inherently* misunderstood by the rest of the population- as they may have a general appreciation of the art's uniqueness and aesthetic value, but will never *really* be able to *intuitively* understand it, as it doesn't naturally resonate with them. In other words, that if it is *really* so one-of-a-kind, that they just won't ""*get it*"". That after all their efforts, they may end up back where they started from- which for some of us- is the starting point of *not being seen/heard,* which is one of the major motivations for creativity anyway...
   3. On the other side of this type of originality is resonance, which among other interpretations, can also be described as a feeling of deep and genuine universality/humanity. Which is something that (imo) is proportional to how much a piece of art moves you. To how much it makes you... feel. It's like... it comes from a place of care- care about the world, care about yourself, and care about all that lies within yourself. 
   4. It's the reason that when a child hands you an objectively shit-looking drawing, or fucks around on a piano/drum set/even something that's not strictly an instrument (wine glass? rubber band?), it's still the best thing, because you can feel that even though they dgaf about objective quality, it comes from a loving/open/playful/human place. And it's not even that they don't *care* what others think, it's that the actual *concept* of external judgement/approval mattering hasn't even formed in their heads yet. 
   5. Whereas somebody performing an objectively complicated/beautiful piece, but only out of a desire for fame/technical perfection/because their parents told them to, can sometimes make you feel sort of... uneasy. There's a sense of disquiet to it. (Anyway- I think originality naturally comes about when speaking/performing from a place of resonance- but that's a whole other topic...)
   6. Resonance also has something to do with what's going on within yourself- your thoughts, emotions, and motivations, and what makes you feel most strongly. With exploring why you currently feel the way you do (about your creativity). With exploring what made/makes you create in the first place. With understanding that you're not alone in feeling this way about creativity. With wondering at what point the 'magic' left, and was replaced with this incessant 'need' to 'produce' (see point 3.2). With pretending that you could never play music or write or create again, and then creating again for the second 'first time', like it was brought back from the dead. Putting some of this into words in your own time may help you not only to understand yourself and the current situation, but also to clear your cache\~...
   7. In a nutshell- perhaps originality is not *the* standard to which our personal/creative value is judged after all, if such a thing as 'creative value' even exists.
