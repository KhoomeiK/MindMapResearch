Surprised to see no one commenting on the GS Pay scale specifically.

In a sentence I can tell you the GS pay scale is...fucked. For federal government positions unfortunately this specific pay scale generally trumps experience. 

What I mean is right now you can work for 1-3 years at this GS-13 pay scale...and move to a GS-14/GS-15 position as say...upper management in the EPA with no experience in that field. 

Federal employment is generally guranteed hours, even in shutdown if you work you'll eventually get paid, great benefits/holidays etc.

Yet the main thing in the end is job security and flexibility. At that pay scale...even if your office shutdown you'll find something easy and ludicrous at that pay scale unless the entire government collapses.

Take the position. They don't just hand out GS-13 positions like candy...most people have to work 10 years for the federal government to attain it"
