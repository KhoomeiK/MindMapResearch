Going from “2010 indie horror about three skiers who find themselves stranded on a ski lift in the mountains of New England” to “Elsa traveling to the enchanted forests and dark seas beyond her kingdom -- an adventure that soon turns into a journey of self-discovery.”

Major tonal shift from Frozen to Frozen II. 

Basically. All they kept thematically was the snow."

That sounds pretty satirical. The first part of the comment was definitely sincere. 

My comment was in response to your over-zealous tirade over “specific Asia is not all Asia” 

My whoosh comment was saying you missed the context and tone of the second part of the post.
