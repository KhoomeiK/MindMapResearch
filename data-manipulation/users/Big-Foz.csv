AskReddit,ffnezvl,t1_ffmc1nm,1580065118.0,"I’m a teacher of 16-19 years and recently asked ‘what’s a missionary’ in relation to a recent news story. 

It was only after they started giggling and answering with ‘if you don’t know by now...’ statements that I realised my error and Re-worded the question."
BallBusting,ffne9no,t3_eu5cth,1580064811.0,"Non-consensual ballbusting is assault. Simple as. There’s a serious argument to be made that deliberately kicking someone in the balls is sexual assault. 

Whilst I do find ballbusting a fascinating curiosity and I’m more than happy to let people indulge their own kink in their own way, I do very much dislike the way it’s seeped in to popular culture that kicking a man in the nuts is not only acceptable but downright hilarious. 

Grown men letting someone abuse their balls is one thing, young boys being told (whether outright or implied) that being kicked is somehow just a part of being Male and they’ve probably deserved it in some way is pretty infuriating. 

While I think you might have gone a bit too hard in your original post there is a salient point there."
BallBusting,fffsbxg,t1_ffdnuhf,1579890730.0,"From what I’ve seen, there are few women in cuntbusting videos that can take a kick at the same force as the men in ballbusting videos. Not sure why, most women I know are absolutely certain it wouldn’t hurt them."
BallBusting,ffdk78j,t3_esuapk,1579822622.0,"I’m way more into cuntbusting than ballbusting. Ballbusting is more a curiosity thing for me whereas I think cuntbusting is hot. Especially two naked women. 

The downside is that 90% of cuntbusting videos are bullshit. They’re barely making any contact or they’re hitting 4, maybe 5 kicks in a whole video. There are ballbusting vids where men are taking multiple kicks at force and these women can’t even endure a tap."
