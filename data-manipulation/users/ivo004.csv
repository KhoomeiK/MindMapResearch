gaming,fgth1ry,t1_fgtggue,1581104403.0,"Yeah, totally fair to not like fast paced rts like StarCraft. You got bunker/cannon rushed, which is annoying and mostly only tried by people who want to be annoying. I thought you got upset that they just had a builder looking at your base, which is pretty much a standard thing to do in all but the lowest level games. A 1.5 hour StarCraft game would be way too intense and completely draining haha. 

Do you play any total war games? I love the Warhammer ones and they're much more like what you're talking about. They essentially have a watered down grand strategy component for the overworld play and the rts component is much more deliberate. It involves formations, planning, and units that respond to commands more like they're being yelled at across a battlefield as opposed to the near psychic link immediacy of StarCraft responses."
gaming,fgtf1p3,t1_fgt6h0x,1581103650.0,"Sending the early builder is just standard scouting. You just spam some clicks on the minimap to 1. find your opponent if there are multiple spawn possibilities or 2. figure out what race they are if they went random or 3. make sure they aren't doing a crazy rush strat. I can understand quitting because you got cannon rushed or 6 pooled several games in a row, but someone taking 5 seconds to click on 4 spots on the map to send an early scout isn't necessarily an indication of a pro player or anything to get frustrated by."

Our healthcare isn't cheaper by any means, but it feels cheaper to a lot of people because it's taken out of your paycheck by your employer before you ever see it, much like taxes. Most Americans aren't into math, so they just get excited when money gets deposited and don't break it down into what percentage goes where. Part of the aversion to single payer is that people don't realize that even though more money would be going out in taxes, they would no longer be losing money from each paycheck to directly pay for their health insurance. 

The real estate market differences are definitely regional. Where does your friend live in the states? There is a vast difference between property prices in major coastal cities and small rural areas in the middle of the country, potentially to the degree of a similar property costing more by a factor of 5-10 times in a place like California compared to somewhere like Nebraska."
facepalm,fgmsp80,t1_fgmplrt,1580931268.0,"Typical holiday leave in a decent job starts at about 12 days of paid leave, not including major holidays. Many jobs increase that amount after certain time thresholds (I get 20 days a year since I've been in my position 3+ years). Some jobs have absolutely zero paid leave. Some supervisors at positions with paid leave won't approve the use of leave even if the employee has it if they think it will affect operations or if they deem it too much at once (for example, you can take a 3 day weekend, but not the entire week off). 

As for the traveling within the US part, that's what I do. I'm on the east coast so for me, the choice is between paying thousands of dollars and using at least a week of leave to go to a Mediterranean beach/Alps or driving 4 hours one way to go to the beach or 4 hours the other way to go to the mountains for a long weekend haha.

worldnews,fgmnr1f,t1_fgmmub8,1580928351.0,"Individual insurance plans (as opposed to group plans usually negotiated by employers) are prohibitively expensive, especially considering the types of people who don't have employer provided insurance tend to be poorer. One of the main issues is that for the vast majority of productive adults with full time jobs, employer provided insurance is a fine deal and is all they've known, so they resist any change that would help other people out of fear that it would make their insurance worse. As a people, we are pretty stubborn, so you can shove all the evidence and studies about how single payer plans are cheaper and have better outcomes across the board in their faces, but people just retreat and cling to the system they have known their whole lives. Additionally, our insurance companies exist to make a profit, not improve health outcomes. Sometimes those interests dovetail, but if the choice is between covering a bill no questions asked or catching a technicality that allows the company to gain more profit, they will choose profit 11 times out of 10. They also make coverage information opaque as hell to produce as many technicalities as possible to get out of paying for stuff. Gotta love late stage capitalism. #corporationsarepeopletoo"

WTF,fglzf6n,t1_fgl91p1,1580914661.0,"From my experience owning several rescues of various ages and mental states when I got them, a caring and understanding owner can overcome virtually any negative traits imparted from a past life much easier than you seem to think. Sure, there are some very difficult dogs who you can own for years without them allowing you to touch them (shout out to my boy Tyler), but those are such fringe cases that your sentiment does more harm by discouraging people from rescues than it helps protect people from getting damaged dogs. 

You never know how a dog will react to a caring environment until you try. If you're a new dog owner or have a young child, sure, go for some cookie cutter golden doodle. If you know your way around dogs, there is absolutely nothing more rewarding than nurturing a rescue and watching them develop into a happy and well adjusted member of your family. Also, you can easily find traits like low/non shedding and screen for issues like bad hips or other potential chronic health problems. That doesn't even take into account the fact that most mutts from the pound are much less likely to have those issues than animals you get from all but the most conscientious (read: expensive) breeders. 

Basically what I'm saying is those reasons you gave to get a dog from a breeder instead of adopting are crap and you shouldn't spread them. Every dog will take work to help them grow and the vast majority of rescues don't have any more problematic issues than breeder puppies develop on their own."

I am a public health researcher by trade, so I'm pretty well informed on the goings on of the research world. The link you shared and the references/sources they used are probably the first research I've seen on the topic that actually has decent sample size and methodology and limits the scope to questions they can answer. I'm a normal ass white dude, but I do try to take an interest in research questions that help with disparities and issues of minority groups, so I have attended several presentations and engaged with researchers doing work in the LGBT community.

It's so fucking difficult to do anything meaningful. My particular organization has a WEALTH of data on pretty much any demographic imaginable and has plenty of subjects to be able to draw conclusions, but the trans subjects are so unique in so many ways that it's almost impossible to do anything with the data other than throw it out. The experiences of one trans person are rarely generalizable to another and that problem just becomes more complex when you try to draw conclusions about how their experiences and characteristics affect other variables. You see so many nascent studies by grad students with sample sizes of 15-50 wildly varied individuals whose very nature goes against the grouping required to draw scientific conclusions.

I don't know that I really have a point to this, other than to thank you for sharing this apparently rigorously done research and to lament that even when scientists want to address the needs of super marginalized groups like the trans community, it is often next to impossible to actually accomplish anything meaningful."

If you're looking for more ships, I would go for a tie advanced x1 (Vader) for the empire and either a y wing or a second x wing for rebellion as your first buys. After that, adding in a tie fighter expansion and any of x/y/b wings for the rebels would be great. 

One less obvious thing about the core set is that the standalone expansions of the ships that come in the core set have different pilots, so it's not a waste to buy another x wing or tie since you get different stuff (x wing expansion comes with wedge, nuf said). 

As for playing by yourself, I would recommend downloading fly casual for solo practice (it's free and has decent ai) and trying to get your girlfriend and other friends to try out the actual game with you. After you have the basics down, look for a local league or group at a game store. My fiance played several games as I was learning, but my experience got sooooo much better when I worked up the nerve to go to my flgs league night.
