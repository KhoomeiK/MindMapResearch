It's like, caviar might be for you, but it's not for me and you can't force me to like it. If I don't want to play a map; I don't





What about mounting on flat surfaces, that only shows your head. Mounting around corners is also a way way better option than standing there like an idiot because mounting still hides your body. Both cases of mounting (on horizontal surfaces and around corners) decrease recoil, which is a huge advantage for the mounter.





Yea, I can use shrapnel to counter shrapnel; I can also use a 725 to counter a 725, but does it mean that I will? No. You can use a cancerous strat/mechanic to cancer another cancer strat/mechanic, but that still doesn't mean that the strat/mechanic is balanced; If I use your argument for every cancerous mechanic in popular video games, shit just wouldn't get nerfed; I could just say ""Oh, this thing is OP? Then you yourself use it.""Hacking Claymores? Really? Have you ever hacked a Claymore? Who has time for that?





Mate, and even when I ""rush tactically"", I still get caught off from an unorthodox angle; the problems with these maps is that there are way too many angles to check and not enough time. You aren't having a problem with it, but a lot of other people (including myself) are. That was my whole argument. If you hate the map, you don't have to play it..."
modernwarfare,fbwek05,t1_fbwdtz3,1577147844.0,"EOD nearly kills you; someone literally has to breathe on you for you to die, and the guy camping inside will probably kill you. The old CoDs had a way better system for this: The claymores exploded after one second. The game does promote camping; how are my arguments dumb? Don't say they're dumb; tell me how they're dumb; refute my points, and don't just say ""urhehhehheh ThE pOinTs ArE DuMb"". And a lot of people agree with the things I say, so you calling my points dumb is just making me think that they aren't. You really look like you haven't played the older CoDs, where the player experience was prioritized and camping wasnt promoted. Claymores had counters, and you didn't have to take damage from them to counter them. (this part was edited too)

Edit: A major portion of the CoD community is casual; we don't have the time to devote ourselves to learning the maps, and even if we do, we want to play CoD like we used to do, aggressively, and not tactically. I have played tactical games: I've played R6 Siege; I've played CS:GO, in which I reached a really high rank (DMG) after playing for four years, and I feel that the tactical playstyle doesn't fit CoD. You like to play tactically, it's your damn choice; you want to learn the maps, your damn choice, which is why map filtration should exist, so we have choices. Stop forcing your playstyle down my throat because i'm probably not going to adapt it.

Edit 2: and honestly, you cannot deny that 3 lane maps are more liked; they're just better to play on. The three most liked 6v6 maps in this game are 3 lane designs.

Edit 3:literally none of IWs ""complex maps"" are received well. Picadilly? People hate it. Azhir Cave? Fucking deplorable. Rammazza? Mixed reviews."
