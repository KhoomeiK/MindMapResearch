bipolar,ff9krwo,t1_ff9k0da,1579715085.0,Lol
bipolar,fd5yztv,t1_fd5xpnk,1578183285.0,When I have been grandiose I really thought my moods were governed by some overarching zeitgeist. Like...i was a harbinger of some societal season change. So this dark mood would be something reflected in the world rn. But I lose any meaning in that statement when I'm like this.
bipolar,fd5yfic,t1_fd5xpnk,1578183079.0,"Yeah. It feels like perpetually drowning. In a fog, to cover something horrible."
bipolar,fd5y3im,t3_ejz1vm,1578182957.0,"I don't know if this counts but often I feel pressure in my head. It's very real but not the same as a headache, but extremely uncomfortable nonetheless. Sometimes it gets so bad I have to wrap my head tightly in a towel or whatever so that I feel like the pressure inside isn't so bad, or at least contained"
bipolar,fd5xoqp,t3_ejzktr,1578182812.0,"Yes, I almost always get depressed before mania. Not every single time, but def the majority"

bipolar,fd5vx8s,t1_fd5viec,1578182165.0,"Yup, pretty much. But muted. Like its deep down. On top...at the surface there's nothing. Just a terrible, terrible calm..."
bipolar,fcokbpg,t1_fcog4oo,1577834391.0,I lost the one I had. That's partly why I'm making one now :)
bipolar,fbvlvru,t1_fbvl8ne,1577132693.0,"Light has always held a lot fascination for me. Symbolically, metaphorically, it has a lot of meaning, I think. It holds a lot of secrets."
