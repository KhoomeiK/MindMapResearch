Every number has a unique prime factorizations, e.g. 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. Here, 'x' represents some unique prime and the number that is factorized is also not given. It only goves you the prime factorization of some number. The question is similar to:

here is the prime factorization of 21 = 3 * 7, what is the prime factorization of 5 * 21^2?
