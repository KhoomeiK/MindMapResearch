socialanxiety,fem3ypx,t3_eppibl,1579238959.0,"Everybody else will have trouble finding partners too, so don't feel too awkward. Just exclaim that you are free to work with anybody."
socialanxiety,fem2pi7,t3_epuz6s,1579237794.0,"Maybe ask them if they are happy with their scores, then bring up how your score is lower than expected due to the grading. Perhaps you can convince the group to be more generous with the grading, so that everybody does well in the end?"
socialanxiety,fecbyht,t3_enw3su,1578970413.0,"As a disclaimer I have never been properly diagnosed with SA but here was my experiences arising during my kindergarten to 3rd grade years: 

\- If I didn't understand how to do classwork, I would shut down and just cry. I could not just ask for help. Some teachers thought I was being resistant and would send me to the principal's office.

\-I felt uncomfortable being the ""line leader"" (head of the line of kids). 

\-I felt uncomfortable ordering different cafeteria food than the other kids; especially if others thought it was ""gross."" Similarly, I didn't like sharing my favorite food preferences if they seemed strange.

\-I didn't like revealing what toys I played with or my play-style. 

\-I think I generally just didn't like talking about my family, my experiences, or any of my preferences with others.

\-I felt uncomfortable being around others in my favorite outfits/clothes.

\-Being quiet or known as ""shy""

\-Sometimes playing alone or turning down the invitation to play.

\-Report cards always said that I needed to ""come out of my shell more.""

\-Being apprehensive to go to the library, the lunchroom, the front office, or nurse's office.

\-Being scared of teachers, the lunch ladies, the bus driver, etc.

\-Being sent to ""special classes"" or counseling because the teacher doesn't know how to deal with you.

\-Having to repeat a grade (I repeated first grade) because of ""mysterious reasons."" Because SA can be invisible to your parents--they don't understand that something is wrong.

\-Always clinging to your parents or siblings when not at home.

\-Avoiding family members at family functions.

That's all I got so far. Sorry for the inconsistent list. Honestly, I'm shocked because I just realized that many of them I still struggle with as an adult. It hurts thinking that despite all of these signs, my parents never noticed anything wrong and still act like nothing is."
socialanxiety,fec4agf,t3_eo5you,1578966442.0,"I've been in this same situation. You can go to your library or find another chill spot to hang out at. You can do your school work, have a snack, get on computers, etc. If you do go to the gym, you can go early on and spend some of the time afterwards relaxing and freshening up. Take it slow and just walk on a treadmill; listen to music. My school has a mall next to it, so sometimes I'd go to the mall. Alternatively, you can check out other school resources like tutoring or counseling. You'll settle in just fine in time :)"
socialanxiety,fd6notz,t3_ek10xl,1578193527.0,"I was that way lol still kinda am. The more you mix it up, the more you will feel comfortable. Don't put yourself in a box. Maybe try a side braid or half up half down? Most of the time people don't say anything about it."
