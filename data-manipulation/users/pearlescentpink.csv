DaintyGorls,fg6w53g,t1_fg6s48j,1580578264.0,"The difference for the Agricultural Land Reserve is that the scheming approach isn’t really necessary at 600lbs. If she was honest with her doctor and said that she needed help with her depression and weight loss, they could prescribe her a combination of medications that could treat depression and suppress appetite. She is taking the ‘logic’ low BMI disorders and applying them to her condition. Yes, I understand there is disorder at play, but sneaking around to try and get meds that will help with weight loss isn’t necessary when you literally have hundreds of pounds to lose. She would probably get a better response by asking for them outright. 

She may not get meds that are as ....fun to take as adderal or vyvanse (I use ‘fun’ loosely), but they will get her where she wants to be. Topomax, for example, may dull mental acuity, but at high enough doses, it’ll make you forget food is a thing and would have less interaction with the bipolar disorder she apparently has (good luck getting Adderal or Vyvanse with that diagnosis, ALR). Someone like her is in a really lucky spot—they have the luxury of trying meds without a lot of consequence. For most people, they have to cycle though medications all while trying to go to work, take care of a family, run a household, and meet responsibilities and generally keep the symptoms hidden. The only real expectation on ALR is to make a video telling her audience how she is doing."

Identification, puberty, hormones, aging and just plain ol’ styling will work wonders for how people ‘see’ you. Besides, ‘passing’ isn’t just about looking the part, it’s about embodying the part. Putting a cis-gendered, male identifying man in a dress won’t make people thing he is a woman because he is still performing masculinity.

namenerds,fdlse3u,t1_fdivf3c,1578531371.0,The costly part for me is getting new documentation. I’m a dual citizen so I have to do everything twice. It’s a couple hundred dollars on passports alone.
namenerds,fdls5b2,t1_fdk6j8a,1578531203.0,"Honestly, it was because my mother said she would write me out of her will if I did. I realized later that disinheriting a child for changing their name is petty as _shit_ and that my mother won’t really have a say in her estate when she is dead and my siblings are all pretty good people who would be fair to me.

When I eventually got the courage to go and actually do the fingerprinting and get all the stuff from the police that I needed; the officer transposed my current name and the new name. I decided that was probably a sign that I should think it through a little more. I never pursued it further.

(My mother doesn’t make empty threats; and for some reason names matter to her—my name specifically. No matter how many times I have told her I kept my ex husband’s last name, she will still send mail to my maiden name. She knows that I have to go to the post office with and expired passport from when I was 15 to pick it up because it’s the only photo ID I have with that name. I got married at 17, this has been my name my entire adult life, almost as long as I had my maiden name for. Sorry for the long post, I get salty over this.)"

I should have listened. Apparently where I got married you can remove middle names in favour of your spouse’s name."

namenerds,fdhveha,t1_fdhr98l,1578430841.0,"I never changed my name back after getting divorced because I was going to change my first and last name (my legal name is stupid long). When I saw how much it was going to cost, I just decided to wait until I get married again if I’m going to do it. Might as well just take the hit once. I understand why there is a cost associated with it, but I hate that it takes so much planning, and there are so many irritating little details. I wish it were just a unified system. Change your name in one place and it changes your name everywhere else."

So many empires, so little time (to learn them)."

I fail to see how that is at all different from a dog filter."
