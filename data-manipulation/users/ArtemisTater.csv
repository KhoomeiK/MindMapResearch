It's crazy, because the topic of my boyfriend and I moving in together came up and his father threw a fit. It's like waking on eggshells with that dude. While my boyfriend does have his own assets and savings, there's no way he would be able to afford college without his father. His dad also adds like more rules and stipulations every time they get into it."
college,fevxsol,t3_eqjiyy,1579402872.0,"Hell yes. Except usually it's more of the professors if it happens. It also happens in clubs. My roommate was a part of ACJA. The president deleted her off of the email list because she decided to be petty about something my roommate's sister did. This girl also likes to be super judgemental to anyone who crosses her path. So yes, it definitely happens."

depression,fett660,t3_eqjhex,1579379776.0,"Relatable. My boyfriend comes from a wealthy family. His mom is super awesome. His Dad however, while he can be nice, is a dick when it comes to my boyfriend's college education. He pays for his college, his phone, etc. But last semester he had a mental crisis and wanted to change majors. His Dad threw a fit about his grades and said some really cruel things. Started holding his college tuition over his head, etc. Their relationship had never been great, but it just got worse from there."

college,fd3q1sp,t3_ejwctb,1578160686.0,"Sounds like a similar situation I faced. For some background, I wasn't raised by my parents but by a lousy uncle and Aunt who also had crazy expectations of me.

My #1 choice was Trine University for their engineering program. It's a private school and it's pretty small. The other thing is that it's like far away enough from my aunt and uncle that it was an inconvenience for them to try and come up there. I don't like them. I was top 15 in my class and yet that still wasn't good enough because I wasn't in the top 5. I made a 3.86 gpa in high school and that still wasn't good enough. They tried to convince me to go to Purdue or Rose Hulman, but I hated both. Plus there was this whole issue for whatever reason that they would be like ""Trine costs too much"" yet Rose Hulman is more expensive??? Plus they weren't paying for my education anyways.

My advice is that you do what you think is right. It sounds like your parents are being unreasonable. Unless they are the ones paying for your education, they should not have an influence in your decision. Even if they are, you really need to express your interest and really at the end of the day, all it boils down to is that it's a degree. Try and reason with them about how much money you'd be saving, the perks about the college, etc. Good luck!"

college,fd3if5f,t3_ejrq13,1578158607.0,"I would honestly retake it with the first professor. My boyfriend just went through this same crap. You already know what to expect from this professor, so you can go in with a different mindset and possibly beat her at her own game. My boyfriend's first grade was an F. His second time around, it was a B. I've also gone this same route with a Java class. Just keep trying! Good luck!"

college,fcwfa73,t1_fcwf2kv,1578024137.0,"I'm fully open to relocating, the problem is finding somewhere to live and such. It wouldn't be as big of a problem if I was finding an actual job, but right now I'm still trying to become financially stable. If I had an offer somewhere else, I'd happily relocate as long as living expenses were reasonable."
depression,fctm4we,t3_eiuovx,1577948498.0,"It sounds like there were some anger issues with you father. Ive been in a similar situation and I came to accept that you don't need to be pleasing for anyone but yourself. I don't think you're a bad person for those feelings of anger towards your father, as it seems like he's not always been the best. However, if he's wanting a relationship with you, give it a chance at first. However, you need to go in with little or no expectations, because that's how feelings get hurt if he does it again. Keep your guard up enough about it. But if he starts treating you like that again, you need to vocalize how you feel in the nicest way possible. If he still doesn't listen, then he definitely does not deserve that relationship. However, it's up to you. If you think you'd be happier not associating with him, just make sure you don't regret anything later. Good luck!"
depression,fct55rm,t3_eikclj,1577933146.0,"I'm sorry for your loss. I can relate to this on a personal level. It takes time to grieve as it has its place in our lives, and I can tell you the sting truly never quite goes away, but the sadness of loss eventually does turn into remembering the good things. If you can focus on the good times instead of the bad, it does help. I know that it is hard to do that, but eventually things will fall into place."

depression,fct13f6,t3_eihb2v,1577930144.0,"I can honestly relate, but at the same time I don't have the feeling of wanting to die. I just wish to simply not exist. If it were up to me, I'd give my life to a child who has a terminal disease. Life is precious, but damn is it hard."
relationships,fcnsuy0,t1_fcnslor,1577817766.0,"Believe me, I've been trying. I usually don't say anything at all. But there has been maybe twice I've said something. And yeah I see your point. I think it's the whole mentality of ""I'm doing this for you so you have to do what I say"". It will get better when we are out of college I think."
relationships,fcnr0d0,t1_fcnocm0,1577816800.0,"My boyfriend did drive me home, but his mom went with him because he was unfamiliar with the area I live in since I'm usually the one driving. I don't get into a lot of fights with my boyfriend at all, he's super great. He's scared to say anything to defend himself or me, because he is put in a predicament that his Dad likes to hang money over his head. He pays for his college and while my boyfriend does work, he couldn't afford University if his dad decided all of a sudden to refuse to help him pay. 

His mom does not like that and has gotten in a few fights with his Dad about it, and he's like this about anything. He also just wants to be accepted by his Dad, but his Dad is a jerk and I don't think he'd respect my boyfriend if he did meet his ""ideals"". Although he's already expressed to his father he is upset with him as of today, just not my situation in particular. His Dad is always telling him to stand up for himself, but it's awful because the one time he did stand up for himself, his Dad took it as backtalk. So he hasn't done it since. He does however rant to me and his mother about how he feels and unfortunately to keep the peace nothing is said.

As for the annoying and opinionated thing, I stand up for my boyfriend a lot. Not in like a mean way, but I choose my words carefully enough that his Dad won't blow up at me. I try to stay quiet most of the time and try to avoid him. I also talk a lot and when I get nervous I literally don't shut up. I have been working on that for about four years now but sometimes it happens. He's also super judgemental because I'm a bit overweight. He thinks that because of this, I don't take care of myself and that I'm super needy  for whatever reason. Which I actually have been losing weight and have been battling depression. I take the small victories as I can. So anytime the topic comes up, he's quick to comment about what I'm eating or he comments about how he doesn't like this and this...etc. 

Yes, I have professional help and take medication for my depression. I also journal my thoughts a lot and try to keep myself busy to keep my mind off of what I call ""the sulks"", but sometimes they really get the best of me and I just have to hide away so people don't bother me and I can get over it."
