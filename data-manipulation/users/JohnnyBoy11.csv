Even if you dont have money for a respirator, you should at least be able to get surgical masks. Those should be very cheap there and you may want some before they're hard to find. You can still try to cover your nose and mouth with bandana or clothes when you go out.

Prepare, have a plan, and try to enjoy yourself."
