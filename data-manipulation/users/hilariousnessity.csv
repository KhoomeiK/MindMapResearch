landscaping,fe4tz4g,t3_enonuz,1578862733.0,Wow! As someone who lives in the Pacific NW I am so jealous.
crafts,fe4jrp1,t3_ej4foj,1578860068.0,This is fantastic! I would love to make something like this. I'm in the market for a sewing machine. Which one did you use to sew this? Thank you!
sewing,fdz9nh7,t3_en9jq9,1578787999.0,WOW! Really nice job! What kind of a machine do you own?

SelfSufficiency,fdmgi1z,t3_ely2mp,1578549109.0,Thank you SO MUCH for sharing. If I get a tiny bit of this accomplished I will feel lucky.
eczema,fdlr5xh,t1_fdjoem9,1578530532.0,There is absolutely no reason to be sorry about misunderstanding. Most people don't understand vegetarian or vegan diets and their meaning. Good luck to you.
eczema,fdjcowh,t3_ekvdun,1578465463.0,"Just some thoughts. I'm a vegan for years and know something about this topic. 

Veganism has nothing to do with gut healing. Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. 

If your goal is simply to ""introduce good bacteria to your gut"" I recommend eliminating ""unhealthy"" foods from your diet like high-fat high-chemical junk food and introduce more whole grains, fruits, veggies, lo-fat high-fiber proteins like beans and legumes which will definitely improve your gut health and improve your skin. 

Also exercise and don't smoke."
eczema,fdjc5zh,t3_ekqgk4,1578464928.0,Just a some thoughts --> If you wear glasses don't wear them for a couple days just to see if it improves. The glasses could be made of a material that irritates your skin. Or your hair products could be irritating your skin in that area. Or you could be wearing a cap that irritates your skin.
eczema,fdjbl9i,t3_el6cx2,1578464347.0,"My skin does better when I swim in chlorine.

EDIT: I should correct my post to say I don't know if I'm swimming in chlorine because I don't know the chemicals used in the pools but whatever it is almost always improves my eczema."
eczema,fdjbj3e,t3_el652t,1578464289.0,"This might not be eczema and could be ""impetigo"". **Please** go to the doctor and get a professional opinion. Impetigo is contagious and is a common and highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects infants and children. Impetigo usually appears as red sores on the face, especially around a child's nose and mouth, and on hands and feet. The sores burst and develop honey-colored crusts."
eczema,fdjb1im,t3_el7o4p,1578463808.0,"Hello, I'm so sorry you're suffering with eczema. I recommend writing down \*everything\* you consume and product you use for a month or six weeks. You may start to notice some patterns that align with eczema flare ups. Additionally I would think about, and write down or calendar, environmental irritants you may have encountered. Also changes to your environment or living/working spaces that may have aligned with your eczema flare ups."
eczema,fdja92k,t3_eli2kc,1578463046.0,"I have eczema on my scalp and warmer water, shampooing, drying my hair with a towel or a hair dryer and finally combing my hair exacerbates the itching so I don't wash my hair very often and when I do I wash with the coldest temp possible. Colder water soothes my scalp."
ratterriers,fdj79ld,t3_ek5cyw,1578460443.0,I'm so sorry you lost Sammy. I also lost my sweet friend Jackie three days ago. My heart is broken.
dogs,fd65ms2,t3_ek4hg8,1578185863.0,"Coincidentally I'm a grandma and my dog died unexpectedly yesterday and my heart is broken too. There are few things worse than experiencing the death of an animal. 

Today one of my granddaughters sent me a beautiful orchid, a pizza, and brownies. I can tell by your post that you're an empathetic person and care a lot about your grandparents. Your grandparents will really appreciate your attention now when they're hurting. You're doing the right thing by being there."
dogs,fd62vfk,t3_ejw1h5,1578184790.0,My dog Jackie died yesterday and I understand what you're going through. My heart is broken.
dogs,fcyl9yd,t3_ej93p4,1578082086.0,I lost my dog today. I am so sad. My heart is broken.
AnimalsBeingJerks,fbrsms0,t3_ee42p8,1577045917.0,Weird. Chimps are almost bigger assholes than humans.
