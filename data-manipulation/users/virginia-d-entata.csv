I try to get my boys to talk about how they feel as much as possible.  When they express emotion, frustration, depression, etc.  I listen, I ask if they want my take on the situation and offer it when asked.

More importantly, my husband is vocal with his emotions, has cried in front of them and he has NEVER been knocked down for showing his heart."
Cooking,fffs5rj,t1_fff6csk,1579890624.0,Hello Aldi shopper!  Is that the green or yellow lid?  Because the green lid is never in the cabinet - just easier to leave it by the stove.
Teachers,ffex7zb,t1_ffesvrm,1579869162.0,"Talk to your administrators.  Develop a detailed course of consequences and rewards.

Is/are the parent(s) cooperative?  If possible make an open channel of communication so that the student has consistent response at school and home.

I hope your admins are more helpful than mine were.  Good luck!"
Teachers,ffdzboq,t3_et2399,1579832683.0,"I’m a specials teacher.  

We got a nightmare kid last year who made all specials teachers lives hell, the classroom teacher’s life hell, admin’s lives hell...  I probably hugged that kid more than anyone else.

That being said, no matter how much I tried to connect with this kid, no matter how stringently I adhered you my cm plan, no matter how consistent I was with consequences and rewards this kid was just an asshole.

I know it was compensating for other things; but that did not make it any easier to conduct class and provide meaningful instruction for the other students in class.

I was never so relieved to hear that a student was transferring to another school.

Regardless, this is still my last year teaching.

I can’t deal with anyone like that kid ever again."

Cooking,ffabvpu,t3_esh9jv,1579731887.0,"Before my husband decided to eat vegetarian 3-4 nights a week (I’ve been veg for 7 years or so), I’d make some big omnivore meat and three and by the time I was done cooking I had zero desire to even make a simple plant based protein for myself so I’d just have a bowl of cereal or a pbj.  Now, because so many if the proteins I make (pulses especially) are so much faster in a pressure cooker, I’ve been using that a lot.  I pile in the ingredients, seal it and wait for the beep. No taste, season, taste again repeat ad infinitum and standing around stirring for an hour.  When it’s ready, I open the pot, adjust seasoning and serve.  

So much less “meh”, so many more meals enjoyed.

I love to cook, I really do; it can just be overwhelming."
Cooking,ffab23b,t1_ffa2lye,1579731401.0,"Take it a step further - leave your house/home for at least ten minutes, literally clear your head of the smell of the food you’ve cooked.

I find that if I do this, I’m much more eager to eat whatever I’ve made.  I’m no longer saturated with the smell of the food, and I can appreciate the melange of smells which seem to be my most important factor in food enjoyment."
