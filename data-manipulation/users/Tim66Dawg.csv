Christian,ff1rm17,t3_er09ip,1579484637.0,"1 John about assurance. You love God’s commands - desire to obey. You love God’s people - desire fellowship. You love God’s Word - desire for truth. Not that we are perfect in these. That’s why grace.
I’m summarizing a lot, but hope this leads you to the verses the Bible gives us about assurance of salvation. We are told to work out our salvation with fear and trembling and my thoughts are if we have desire in these three areas and work and persevere in them then we can have assurance."
Bible,fekqtqs,t3_epn16e,1579205705.0,"Our church is going through John. As we do, we repeatedly read these verses from John 20:

 [**30**](https://biblehub.com/john/20-30.htm)And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: [**31**](https://biblehub.com/john/20-31.htm)But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. 

In other words there are many things that were done and we don't know about, but divine inspiration indicates that the ones we have are sufficient.

I don't know if this is relevant for you, but this helps me in my doubtful times."
aww,fe8kuzi,t1_fe6tboq,1578927300.0,And then casual my work is done here walking away. :)
Bible,fdk9c6p,t1_fdk0h1i,1578499015.0,"I really like Romans 1 for an unbiased approach to the fact that sin is sin. Adultery is adultery. And that it does call out changing the natural use of our bodies, dishonoring our bodies, and that we are all without excuse.

I'll put v32 here in both KJV and NASB because it has been especially on my mind lately:

NASB 

**32** and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them. 

KJV 

**32** Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. 

So whichever way it is you are more prone to have an unnatural use of your body or of dishonoring it...it's still sin and then we are prone to ""give hearty approval"" to however that is done if we somehow are trying to justify that particular way in our own minds."
Cooking,fd4nnt4,t1_fd4lbwu,1578169212.0,"When you said let it rest it reminded me of one kitchen I worked in and I don't know if this is good advice or not, but the chicken fried steak there was popular.

We did the first breading as above then these went into the walk-in. Then at service to the fry station and one last breading before frying."
MealPrepSunday,fcy8roc,t3_ej7o83,1578076443.0,I'm almost embarrassed to say that I've never thought to just put frozen veggies into my meal preps. I'm assuming that is what you did. Nice!

DestinyTheGame,fcuodnx,t3_eimzhr,1577985265.0,"I just never feel like I'm going anywhere new or doing anything different.

The Moon was a good diversion. Getting Saint back was fun. And now I'm hunting cookie dough in Mayhem."
AReadingOfMonteCristo,fcoyq0a,t1_fcouhln,1577845284.0,">Not getting ahead is most certainly going to be an issue.

Oh yes. I'm being drawn in rather quickly.

Never read this book. Just finished my first read along on Reddit with War and Peace. I love the read along format.

My initial comment is that I'm struck with how superficial Edmond is at this point. If that is the right word even. Dumas seems to be painting him as very naive or we may be in for a surprise of how manipulative he is being."
