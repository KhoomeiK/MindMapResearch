thinkpad,fekficg,t1_fekbn0t,1579198963.0,"I was wondering if there was an easier solution. Do you think computrace would work on a distro like Arch Linux?

I also read that it's not possible anymore to erase the supervisor password in latest thinkpads."

Regardless, the joke is in bad taste. You wouldn't put someone's child in a cooking pot in front of their parent but you'd do it to your pets because they're too dumb to read it."

Cheers!"
OnePiece,fe08a2g,t1_fdjgm7k,1578805761.0,"There is no alternative for javascript in the modern internet. If only 0.0001% of the website users are actively blocking javascript, it doesn't make sense for the developers to reshape their implementation and cater them. It's up to the users to find solutions which in this case could be using a separate browser profile with javascript disabled for a more privacy oriented browsing session."

reactjs,fdjbpio,t1_fdhtbm9,1578464465.0,What would be a good way to implement caching in this scenario? I can think of a simple way where you put a server between the users and the api that caches the api results by storing them in a database. I was wondering if there was a solution that could be implemented directly on the frontend.

aww,fct2gpq,t1_fcszdli,1577931145.0,"There's plenty of these fabricated stories around that portray the prophet in good light. Many converts to Islam are charmed by these stories and enter the folds of Islam unaware of all the controversial issues with it since no one likes to discuss those. It's fake publicity and karma for the religion. If I was to make up a negative story about the prophet, i am sure plenty of people would have a problem with that.

I have also noticed a recurring pattern in these videos where a Muslim does a good deed and there's always people in the comment section who try to present their religion in an overly positive light. I have first hand experience of the religion negatively affecting my life and it continues to do so. To keep it civil, I'd just like to say that there is more to it than kindness towards a cat."

aww,fcsrv50,t1_fcsan73,1577923528.0,"That story is made up. And I don't mean in the sense that the whole religion is based on fairy tales but that it's considered a fabrication among Muslim scholars as well. Just one of those over the top stories people come up with to make it sound interesting.

Kudos to the guy in the video though for being gentle and kind towards the cat."
archlinux,fc62hpv,t1_fc5mdcs,1577470783.0,Usually the popular application does fit the needs for the majority of use-cases. Most of the times the applications have very similar features and the popular choice is popular for valid reasons.
vim,fbvzz0y,t1_fbve01g,1577138535.0,"I use NT and it's only open when I want to do some file operations (new, duplicate, rename etc). When I'm coding, it's never open so it's not taking any real estate on the screen. I use fzf to open and switch between files. I'm sure many other people use it this way too."
