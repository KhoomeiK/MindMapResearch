wholesomememes,fc4tc0y,t1_fc4nvbu,1577427636.0,"I created this account to try and uplift people. This may not be something that would help that, but I've been suicidal all my life as well. These hotlines may help people, but may not as well. I've never found counsel in them myself, but I'm still here, as you are.   

Don't let that pass you by. It may (probably) sounds incredibly stupid, but it feels like nobody is here for themselves. We all need to be here for each other.   

I'm sorry you're feeling this way and please message me if you would like to talk."
wholesomememes,fc4smn4,t1_fc4n6jj,1577426889.0,"I hope this is a real comment. I often feel like if I were to just, be gone one day, that everything around me would just continue on unchanged. That it wouldn't matter. But then I try to remember the reason I created this account. If you look at my very spanned out comment history, it's only been 2 months or so but the comments have a good chunk of time between them.  

Feeling good happens just as much as feeling awful. It's when we feel awful that it matters most we reach out. Even if it's in such a random or anonymous way. Like this account I have here.   

Saying kind things isn't what keeps me going, it's the thought that the (genuine) kind thing I've said may have possibly kept someone else going.  

I met a very polite man at the gas station today. I noticed he had a helmet so I told him I hope he'd be safe out on the roads since it's raining, and people drive very stupid when it's raining, and wished him the best.  

I don't know why I said what I said to him considering that if I were to get in an accident the very second I pulled out of that same gas station I would welcome death.  But I said it anyway. I *wanted* this stranger to make it home safe. I felt a genuine concern and love for this person....     


That was very early this morning and now it's late at night and I keep thinking about it. I didn't have to say anything but I did. Why? I don't know. I suppose because this person mattered to me. Just simply because they were a kind and innocent human being, and didn't deserve any harm  as I'm sure you are.   

And that's why I have this account. Because life,  no matter what stage it's in, matters I guess. You never know where someone is at in life and at some point you realize, that hey, there's someone out there that is genuinely happy you exist. Even if you just needed a random stranger to let you know.   

You don't have to be happy, just content in the fact that there is someone out there that appreciates your existence. And they will thrive because of it. Be strong. Because that's all we have in life. Is our strength. To be able to carry the ones we love when they need it.   

And don't forget, there will be someone to also carry you. Even maybe the most unlikely person. And it will be out of love. Even if you don't understand why."
