Parenting,feeielo,t1_feei4kx,1579034376.0,"It's been 5 years since I switched jobs.  The only thing that was difficult in the beginning was that I had a LOT of freedom with my other job in terms of coming and going as I pleased.  I left the office a lot.  So, it was an adjustment to be chained to the desk again.  But, I got over that.  Otherwise, it's just been boring, as I said.  But, my daughter was 5 when I changed jobs and I don't regret it AT ALL.

I really think it depends on how ambitious you are.  I've never been ambitious although I've been in a couple of jobs that would make it seem like I was.  I've just always fallen into any job I've had.  So, I don't really feel the need to advance in my ""career.""  Actually, I don't consider myself to HAVE a career.  The only thing I think sometimes is that maybe I'll look for an Admin position someday that has something more creative associated with it.  But, you know, the insurance here is good.  So..."
Parenting,feeho6d,t3_eoqvrl,1579033952.0,I was the exec director of a small nonprofit for 7 years and I became an administrative assistant at a hospital.  It was the best decision.  It was less money but I work 8 hours a day and that’s it.  I’m home and free of any thoughts about work.  I have minimal responsibility and the work is dead easy.  It’s boring.
