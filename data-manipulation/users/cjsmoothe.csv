onebag,ffi99ya,t3_etrgoe,1579968372.0,"Here is my number one travel secret. The BEST neck pillow I’ve found is using a medical neck brace. It’s stiff so it keeps the head upright at any angle. I own two braces for this purpose. I have a black one that doesn’t look too weird. They’re like $15 and very slim so I stole mine along the side of my bag (AER travel pack 1) using the compression straps. Some brands offer different heights so make sure if you’re tall that you get a higher brace. Something like this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M1O79MM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_5BglEbTRXXDPF

Edit: as a bonus, if you’re brave enough you can probably board early ;)"
onebag,ffffob9,t3_etb0k7,1579882941.0,I started doing this years ago after staying in a hostel with tiny towels. Now it’s a habit. The bonus is that my bath towels absorb less water and dry faster.

getdisciplined,fdgm73y,t1_fdgjd4b,1578402001.0,I think that makes sense. Thanks! Love the simplicity.  Is there a way to see a month view?
getdisciplined,fdflhnn,t1_fdeg1p3,1578364469.0,I’m a little confused about the check ins per week vs days per week. Can you explain the difference? Thanks!

onebag,fcit0l1,t3_ehenfu,1577669104.0,"I recently did a lot of research on this topic. I chose adidas terrex line of shoes. Specifically I went with the agravic model: https://www.adidas.com/us/terrex-agravic-xt-trail-running-shoes/AC7660.html. There is a goretex version that is more $. 

Other terrex shoes looked a bit more bulky in the sole but seemed like good options. There are a bunch of them. 

I also considered the Salomon outline shoe, which looks good and can be taken anywhere. 

Pretty hard to one bag with dockers and expect shoes to work.

These also look like a good option: https://www.timberland.com/shop/mens-euro-sprint-trekker-boots-wheat-a1xvq231"
onebag,fbjwm5w,t3_ediusz,1576941203.0,I also have the AER cable kit. It’s great but it’s not that slim. I was debating between that and the incase organizer which looks perfect.  You can get it off eBay[eBay](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F352817016947) for only $20.
