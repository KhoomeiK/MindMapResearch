Metalcore,ffjuy9a,t1_ffjowaq,1580007660.0,Gravity and Temper Temper are terrible. I don't understand how BFMV is so inconsistent. They can write top tier songs like Ashes of the Innocent but then release stuff like Gravity
lonely,ffjt7oj,t1_ffjquyy,1580006294.0,"Yes, for a while."
TruForeverAloneMen,ffjt6w4,t1_ffjqcnm,1580006277.0,Yeah if you go anywhere social it's just a bunch of dudes. Gym is like 95% dudes just awkwardly staring at each other. Bars are like 3 dudes for every girl or it's like one girl in a group with guys. Work is just guys barely anyone talks to girls and the girls just stay quiet because most of them are married. Unless you work retail or something it's a complete sausage fest.
melodicdeathmetal,ffjmb3r,t3_etwcgh,1580001540.0,This is one of the heaviest albums ever
lonely,ffjlwe0,t1_ffjkt3o,1580001260.0,"Same, at 26 i decided it was time to stop for good. Haven't made a single friend since and i'm almost 31."

TruForeverAloneMen,ffj9yrt,t1_ffj9nrz,1579993889.0,It makes you more social but yeah bars and clubs are rough regardless. I hate them. I think they are boring unless you are drunk as hell.
pcgaming,ffj89pq,t1_ffj72ik,1579992828.0,"Yeah COD has better lighting and textures but BF looks much more realistic. The destructive environment, explosions, physics look more realistic. BF looks better especially when you are in close combat environments and stuff is blowing up. It literally looks like real life. Some of COD maps just look fake. Some look really good though."
TruForeverAloneMen,ffix300,t1_ffiwgus,1579984824.0,"Yeah i know man, this stuff is destroying my mental health. Liberalism has taken over damn near everything. Everything is anti masculinity or pussified now."

I never went to college. It's scam for most people."
TruForeverAloneMen,ffiv12m,t1_ffiutjt,1579983406.0,Same. Every year has been getting worse since 2012. I can't find anything to actually get interested in. It's like everything is just dead.
TruForeverAloneMen,ffiuody,t1_ffiu6cf,1579983172.0,There aren't many good games now days either. 2019 was a horrible year for gaming. Worst year ever imo.
TruForeverAloneMen,ffiukpa,t1_ffiu6cf,1579983097.0,I'm getting to the point where i don't even like to post anymore too. I think the internet peaked around 2008-2013 but it's boring now. Wouldn't surprise me if people are just bored as fuck and doing the stuff you said. It's easier to play a video game than post on these dead forums.

TruForeverAloneMen,ffihtw7,t3_ett72s,1579974216.0,"Yeah it feels like a lot of the posts on lonely and FA are fake FA's/stories or people trolling. The lonely sub forum is basically dead. Each thread gets like 3 replies. 

It's not easy to make friends these days unless you already know people and are sociable. This isn't 1995, but normies think you can just walk up to people at any place and become best friends or get a date lol."
science,ffig55a,t3_etoayc,1579973072.0,The whole posting constant videos and pics of yourself on instagram is bizarre.
TruForeverAloneMen,ffi661d,t1_ffhvrs6,1579966132.0,I just got a perm from foreveralone and the mod said i was posting incel stuff. Even though i was just talking about how many more men don't have sex now days and how women fuck around until they hit late 20's and then they look for a beta provider. You can't say anything anymore.
TruForeverAloneMen,ffi5zgh,t1_ffh30xs,1579965990.0,I never visited the incel sub. I think i joined here right when it got banned. That was about the time period when i noticed the internet started to censor everything though. Something is up lol.
TruForeverAloneMen,ffhz184,t1_ffhcoyy,1579959863.0,"You're right, last time I made a video I got like 7 replies lol. Tbh male loneliness could reach like 70% and nobody would care. People would just blame men and tell them to try harder. Lol"
TruForeverAloneMen,ffh6fyc,t3_etdb09,1579924417.0,"There's nothing to do after a certain age. I'm almost 31 and i just sit at home on my PC or do a couple of my hobbies alone. Going to bars, restaurants and random events around town got boring years ago."
TruForeverAloneMen,ffh5fgq,t3_etl36n,1579923614.0,"Even to this day i struggle to believe any girl who isn't deformed or very ugly could feel true extended loneliness. 6 months maybe. But i can't comprehend women facing the kind of loneliness men face

Even 60 yo women have tons of guys in their 20's and 30's hitting on them online"
Metalcore,ffh4x82,t3_et4jxb,1579923216.0,This is their best album. Solid 8/10 with no filler.
Metalcore,ffh3l4v,t3_etdfuc,1579922176.0,"He isn't a good enough singer to pull this off. This sounds like some poverty Slaves/Too Close to Touch. Like this seriously sounds like they are trying to be both of those bands. 

TWA is supposed to be heavy their first 2 albums were heavy as fuck wtf is this shit?"
TruForeverAloneMen,ffh0mrb,t1_ffh0gjs,1579919929.0,Same. But i also find irl conversation so fucking boring. Like it is painful to listen to now. The internet is so much more interesting now days even though i think forums are getting gayer because of censoring.
TruForeverAloneMen,ffh0aia,t3_etkpnu,1579919672.0,"I get weird headaches and depersonalization from spending so much time on my PC. There's nothing else to do. And when i go out i have to be connected to my phone. Real life is so boring compared to PC but i still crave irl conversation. 

I had to download an app on my PC to dim the brightness when browsing srs"
Metalcore,ffgzic0,t3_etfkwt,1579919084.0,Imo this is their best album. No filler tracks. The vocals and guitar work are better on this.
Metalcore,ffgys3q,t3_et8rm9,1579918538.0,Great fucking song. I wish they would make more like this.
melodicdeathmetal,ffgyjtg,t3_etjyye,1579918367.0,What a great album
Metalcore,ffgxm1t,t3_et5mdt,1579917670.0,Yeah those riffs are nice. They haven't really lost a step.
TruForeverAloneMen,ffgqrwr,t3_etj394,1579912682.0,Yeah the sub is different now. It's mostly normie advice and everything is being censored now. I guess it's getting to redpill for them
TruForeverAloneMen,ffgpgov,t1_ffgoyvo,1579911744.0,"Yeah and I feel like it's much worse now. I could get away with being the sometimes pessimistic guy years ago but now days its rejected every time and makes for awkward conversation. If you do that people will give you shit too. Like 99% of conversation as an adult is fake. Idk why people cant just be real. What's the point of living if we have to follow some positive script and dont get to show natural emotions?

I'm sick of suppressing my emotions and putting on an act around people. It pisses me off at work because incant be myself"
TruForeverAloneMen,ffgo885,t1_ffgnkac,1579910872.0,Yeah it's weird and anything pessimistic or real is rejected. It's really weird. I know people dont want to be around negativity but I feel like nearly all conversation is fake and normies are good at telling people what they want to hear. Its impossible for me to be like that because I'm pessimistic and tell it how it is.
TruForeverAloneMen,ffgo6e2,t1_ffgnwnq,1579910836.0,They might be the ones complaining to mods
Metalcore,ffgitm6,t3_etfkwt,1579907220.0,First song I listened to was deep blue and I love it. Going to be listening to this album a lot
TruForeverAloneMen,ffgeg1y,t1_ffgdzn6,1579904406.0,Yeah I just went and checked and they deleted my post about how like 70% of men are being cucked in marriage because they are being beta providers and how men are cucking themselves with online dating. Kind of messed up that everything is being censored these days. Remember 10 years ago when you could post anything on the internet?
TruForeverAloneMen,ffg4v7j,t1_ffg4jjs,1579898503.0,"Truth

And they feel entitled to your attention too. They dont understand what it's like for someone to be quiet. Even if it's just for like 5 minutes. They small talk 24/7"
TruForeverAloneMen,fffz65f,t1_fffyfa7,1579894990.0,Yeah I mean there is literally nothing to talk about unless you want to do some awkward small talk. I cant stand that. Idc about sports or politics anymore. There no way I'm gonna hanging out with people while.they small talk all day fuck that
TruForeverAloneMen,fffubsf,t1_ffft889,1579891966.0,The whole dating system is fucked up now because of dating sites and social media. Most girls can just get attention from hundreds of men now and go on unlimited dates until age find the perfect chad. Average tier men cant get anything anymore. And if you date older girls they are just looking to settle down with a beta provider. It really is a shit show for men these days.
ForeverAlone,fffp7d8,t1_fffnvj6,1579888796.0,That's like 70% of marriages dude. Women dont love men. They are always looking to upgrade or just using them. A lot of guys can't even get a girl now days either or get laid because of online dating which is just millions of men cucking themselves because they are so desperate.
ForeverAlone,fffn8je,t1_fffmvme,1579887601.0,That's you. Millions of men are being cucked.
ForeverAlone,fffln4d,t1_fffk1ot,1579886629.0,Theres nothing to do because nothing matters anymore. Men especially are just being cucked by society and their traditional roles are being taken from them.
ForeverAlone,fffcmv9,t3_et6uxg,1579881020.0,I'm lonely because men are losing their purpose in life these days. The internet disconnected a lot of people from society. I'm wired differently. I've only met like 5 people in my life I liked talking to. I likely have high intelligence although Idk that for sure but I am pretty sure I do. Society is doing a good job at isolating men and destroying the family unit. Not much some of us can do.
ForeverAlone,fff6ymc,t3_etb6ml,1579877284.0,I dont get normies at all they just talk about the same things all day and go out to eat after work. I have different hobbies so everyone thinks I'm a complete shut in retard
ForeverAlone,fff6gcu,t3_etb6ml,1579876918.0,Idc about what 99% of what normies talk about but they all think I'm retarded or autistic because I dont talk
melodicdeathmetal,ffdxxgf,t3_eri0gv,1579831681.0,I miss their sound from Frail Tide. That was a goat tier album.
Post2012change,ffdxk4w,t1_ffbn0u9,1579831416.0,Everything changed and went downhill after 2012. Idk how more people aren't talking about this.
depression,ffdtyz7,t1_ffdsuig,1579828868.0,"You are generalizing. People with higher intelligence have a higher chance of depression and nihilism. They also have a better chance of isolating and having different hobbies than most people. They are more likely to be intellectual, or deep thinkers. Which is not good for forming relationships. That's just how it is man. Not everyone who is smart is going to suffer from depression. I personally am depressed because i know too much. I am too self aware. I am too intellectual. I have nerdy hobbies like PC gaming, storms/weather and metal music. I have always been too intellectual and too self aware since i was in middle school. I have other reasons to be depressed, but this is the main reason i cannot connect with anyone. People do not want to hear me talk about intellectual shit, nerdy hobbies like storm chasing and metal music. I am inside my head all the time. No matter what i try to do. 

If you are truly smart little things people do bug you too. You over analyze everything and it makes it incredibly hard to relate to people. You might even get annoyed with people easily. I'm being serious. Not everyone is like this though, my grandpa is smart and a good problem solver but he gets along well with people."
melodicdeathmetal,ffdqiha,t3_esyjwv,1579826515.0,Forgot about this album. It's good as fuck!

2011 had the EDM vibes and things were relaxing as fuck. I don't remember any kind of dark depressing shit in 2011. It was probably one of the most positive years of the 2000's. Then 2012 hit and everything became dark and depressing and we went straight into a clown world"
depression,ffdfm99,t1_ffczeec,1579819859.0,Not only that but they are oblivious to how a lot of things work. Exposed to less ideas. Have an easier time relating to humans in general. People with higher levels of intelligence are rare. a 120 IQ is pretty rare. Let alone anything higher than that.
ForeverAlone,ffdaqtk,t1_ffczi4w,1579816813.0,"No they don't, unless they have a social circle. Even then you won't get swarmed. I've been approached around 20-30 times in my life but that doesn't mean shit. I rejected 95% of them because they were just randoms that i didn't find attractive or want to talk to.

depression,ffcr4ge,t1_ffcfl51,1579805527.0,"Its pretty easy for most people. Just be low intelligence, low inhibition, low intellect and abuse stimulants and drugs or alcohol. That's how 90% of people cope."

ForeverAlone,ffbztlk,t1_ffbzmsa,1579787858.0,Wrong. There are more women bosses now
ForeverAlone,ffbp8g8,t3_esr810,1579776838.0,Nobody makes any effort now days. Especially as you get older. I am almost positive after 25 basically everyone is taken which is why it is so lonely. When I was 22 everyone wanted to hang out.

ForeverAlone,ffarypq,t3_esf8t5,1579743100.0,Working is modern day slavery. There aren't really any incentives for men to work anymore since women have entered the workforce and more are becoming bosses.

ForeverAlone,ffaq3yw,t1_ffao134,1579741859.0,I don't get contrarians. Like they always have to disagree and then state their opinion as if it is fact. They never agree with anything. So it's impossible to talk to them tbh. One of the worse personalities ever.
ForeverAlone,ffanvz0,t1_ffanr8c,1579740360.0,Same here. When i say stuff i can see the confusion on people's face. I don't know why. Do you think other people are just becoming more socially inept as well? Even when my social game is going well people still look confused quiet a bit.
melodicdeathmetal,ffam4a8,t3_erpmlq,1579739164.0,Love the vocals on this song. They are an underrated band.
ForeverAlone,ffalnrd,t3_es9qt8,1579738848.0,I wouldn't be surprised if more than 50% of men are lacking sex lives based on that washington post study. People were having much more sex before the internet. People keep denying the studies but every year it gets worse. And a decent amount of women aren't having sex too.
lonely,ffajn99,t1_ffaapqy,1579737384.0,"That's because men don't have a support group and suffer silently. Even the most foreveralone woman will have support and meet people just because they exist. A man can literally put in 110% effort and still end up with no friends, no dates and never move up at a job. That's just how society is."
lonely,ffaiqhb,t3_eseca8,1579736706.0,Lonely people are like homeless people. People see them but they don't really get to talk to anyone. They have no support. They have to beg to have interaction with people. It's insane to think about.

lonely,ff8pqno,t1_ff8n0iz,1579690781.0,Yeah I get down to like 12-13% bf in the summer and it doesn't matter. Almost everyone is fat and out of shape after 30 too. Like everyone I meet is the same person now. Fat and out of shape and just cares about their boring career or job and kids. The difference between 30 yos and early 20s is insane and it just hit me out of nowhere how fucked up things are after 30. It's the people man.

I have unpopular hobbies/interests. I have a different sense of humor. Yeah i kind of dress different because i wear metal shirts a lot. I also wear some normie shit like sports clothes but people probably think i'm weird when i wear metal shirts. I listen to metal and hate top 40 music. I've just never connected with them.
lonely,ff7uj50,t1_ff7u8dl,1579658690.0,Exactly. Idk why more people aren't talking about this. They all act and look the same. Talk about the same things. I don't get it. I feel alone around them because they all act the same and then they get mad at you because you have a different personality.
lonely,ff7p6dj,t1_ff7odmg,1579654963.0,I can't cope with this. I don't have any energy to go anywhere after work. I just had 4 days off and felt like shit and tired most of the time. I don't know how people cope man unless they already have friends and people to go places with. I'm always in a bad mood especially after work. It's torture being a wageslave.
