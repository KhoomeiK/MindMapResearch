dogs,ffz0lzl,t3_evyc2c,1580360168.0,"I'm so envious of artistic talent like yours!  Beautiful.  If I may ask, how long did this take you?"
dogs,ffiu64o,t3_etuxbg,1579982806.0,"This looks to me like a legit breeder.  There's both performance and conformation titles on the sires and dams, lots of health tests listed (though I didn't follow up to check the kennel name on the health test registries), ACDCA merit membership, and not many litters.   I also don't see red flag stuff like pricing based on coat colors.

However, I don't see details about any contract a buyer would be bound by, so I'd definitely ask about that.  Despite that, I'd probably put this breeder on my list of good possibilities to pursue."
dogs,ffh9lld,t3_etl1rt,1579927101.0,"Baby socks or something like it would work well, but instead of medical tape you might try vet wrap.  It's stretchy, supportive, and doesn't pull fur when removed."
dogs,ffbdqpk,t1_ffbbhxd,1579760989.0,"I think it's useful too, if only because it can help to focus you on the concrete/quantitative issues rather than the more abstract grief.  

Whatever you decide, you seem like a good human with your dog's best interests at heart, and I am sure he knows that."
dogs,ffb9wgi,t3_esntal,1579756663.0,It's so terribly hard to see one's longtime buddy age like this.  Here's a [quality-of-life scale](https://vet.osu.edu/vmc/sites/default/files/import/assets/pdf/hospital/companionAnimals/HonoringtheBond/HowDoIKnowWhen.pdf) by the Ohio State Univ Vet School that might help you make the right decision.
dogs,ffb922y,t1_ffami4a,1579755640.0,"Our first Aussie never howled in his 13 years, so we were not expecting our current Aussie to ever start.  But he's such a follower that I'm not surprised he took to it when our mix showed him it could be cool (and amusing to the humans).

The funniest thing is *how* he howls:  it starts as a squeal in the highest register you can imagine, and then sllloooowwwllly slides down an octave.  Repeat.  It's so shrill it could cut glass, and with none of the ""ar-ar-aROO"" kind of rhythm.  He just puts his chin in the air and squeals until our mix tells him they're done LOL."
dogs,ffb8js3,t1_ffaphdx,1579755061.0,The mimicry here sounds pretty amazing.  Positively parrot-like!
dogs,ffb8alw,t1_ff9rzpp,1579754768.0,"My experience is the opposite:  never had any dog that howled until our li'l Aussie mix, and now the Aussie too."
dogs,ff9exx2,t3_esd28e,1579711558.0,"Our male Aussie didn't ever howl for the first ~3 years of his life.  Our mix arrived on the scene and she startled us by being a howler at every siren -- and she spurred him to start howling.  Now, any siren makes them dash out the doggy door together, stand side by side, and do a duet.  It's hilarious."
skiing,ff9dtp7,t3_ese0w4,1579710844.0,Amazing how a dog's stoke without skis > a human's stoke with skis.  All the time.
dogs,ff4qz98,t3_ern4mr,1579570334.0,"Usually a dog will follow/chase you if you run AWAY from it.  You might also try to pair that with an enticing sound, like a big paper bag with some kibble in it to rattle.  Or sit on the ground with the interesting-sounding kibble bag and see if the dog will be curious enough to approach.

It sounds like this poor dog isn't used to being much of a pet, so it's going to be tricky.  But it's so good of you to try to help him not get killed on the road.  (Edit: an extra ""and"")"
TheWayWeWere,ff4q9b7,t1_ff2xrxg,1579569839.0,That's so sweet.

dogs,fek1we9,t3_epk7i7,1579190846.0,"I've never known an old dog that didn't love slow neighborhood walks to sniff and enjoy the weather!  The same street is always new to a dog's nose, which is mentally stimulating.  And if she gets tired on the way back, you could pull a little wagon along with you and give her a ride home. :)"
dogs,fefkkze,t3_eot6nd,1579058302.0,"The best high-value training treats for our dogs are the [Real Meat Company's 95% lamb/liver jerky](https://www.chewy.com/real-meat-company-95-lamb-liver-jerky/dp/110506).  

We love it because it's easy to break into tiny pieces, it's almost pure meat, and 12oz is about $12.   I think they love it because it's chewy and stinky -- they will practically do handstands and backflips for this stuff!"
dogs,fefiypc,t3_eovy2p,1579057305.0,"Isn't it great that dogs don't decline food because of aesthetics, or because you got their order wrong? :)

We recently dropped an egg taking it out of the fridge.  One whistle brought both dogs running, and they acted like it was Christmas getting to lick up a whole egg AFTER they'd already had breakfast!"
dogs,fe052qy,t1_fe01kzg,1578803271.0,"Oh no, only 3 WEEKS old?  What a terribly sad backstory...until you came on the scene.  

You're a good human.  I can't help but think Gutter knows he's lucky."
dogs,fdzzpm3,t1_fdyau23,1578799632.0,"Poor guy.  But I can't help but think if I were found in a storm drain as a youngster, I'd probably hate rain and thunder too!  :("

AustralianShepherd,fdu1ezp,t3_en0xeb,1578725805.0,"He's so handsome and wise looking!

You brought back a fond memory of our first Aussie doing a 3 mile hike through an Oregon coastal forest with us on his 13th birthday.  Like Ozzy, he was a trooper."
skiing,fdtcx85,t1_fdt4doa,1578714976.0,">people who tore theirs getting off the lift when a snowboard trapped it

This is why I will not ride a 2-seater or 3-seater chair with my snowboarder partner.  I need plenty of space away from how he whips and wiggles the back end of his board when he disembarks."
dogs,fdsb9t8,t3_emwp1k,1578698642.0,"In the past couple of decades, our two male Aussies have been HUGE foodies (drooling, staring, knowing to within ~15 minutes when mealtimes are).  But our two mixed breed females have been less food obsessed -- a little finicky even, and definitely not droolers.  And a family member's young male pitbull mix is not much into food at all, which makes it hard to motivate him for training purposes.

So I don't think it's universal.  But I do find it easier to work with dogs that love to eat!"
WiggleButts,fdhz4sm,t3_elb6n3,1578432807.0,"At least he's got a full coat on while waiting for the doc to finally come in.  Being naked under a gappy cotton gown is way worse.

He's adorable!"
