The victim, who is a concealed weapon permit holder, pointed his firearm at Ericsson who he believed was armed and coming towards his family. Prowler Ericsson fled into the neighborhood.

Officials say within minutes Officer Williams arrived and deployed his partner K-9 Otto to search for the subject. Additional Officers arrived and began looking for Ericsson. Ericsson, who had been hiding in a yard, quickly surrendered to officers.

Police say a search of Ericsson yielded a blue lighter that had a pistol-like grip on it. No firearm was located in a search of Ericsson and/or the neighborhood.”"
