Trump, like Clinton, will always have been impeached. Doesn't matter if they weren't removed from office."
TrueOffMyChest,fg69y80,t1_fg69af3,1580560815.0,"They don't control access to public office, though. There have been independent elected officials, heck, Sanders wasn't a Democrat until he ran for president in 2016. Just because a lot of Americans are too lazy to look deeper than a D or R next to a person's name doesn't mean the parties control who can be an elected official or not.

And again, so what? So let's say the DNC rigs the whole thing, and an unpopular politician gets the nomination as a result. They'd just lose in the general election. And if they kept rigging things to let their preferred candidate win the nomination, they'd keep losing in the general, until they either changed or were abandoned for a new third party. There's a mechanism in place to punish the parties for bad choices.

But the behaviour of the Senate Republicans has destroyed the mechanism that was put in place to punish bad choices by the President. Since the DoJ has apparently embraced the fiction that no president can even be investigated during their time in office by the criminal justice system, the only way to hold them to account during their time in office is through impeachment and removal. And now the Republican party has made it clear that, eh, doesn't actually matter if the president commits crimes. The president can do whatever they want. Because apparently the president is actually just an absolute monarch for four years?"
TrueOffMyChest,fg6949l,t1_fg67y9e,1580559780.0,">The DNC holding a fair and impartial primary is as important as the republican majority holding a fair and impartial removal trial of the president.

No, guy, it's really not. Because again, one of these things is a private organization changing its internal rules, and the other is elected officials helping the literal president of the United States get away with committing literal crimes. 

In another comment you compared the DNC's efforts to changing the rules of the Superbowl halfway through the game. And y'know what, I'd agree with you. Because a team losing the Superbowl, even if they lost because the other team cheated, is not nearly as important as the precedent being set that presidents can just commit whatever crimes they feel like and nothing will happen."
