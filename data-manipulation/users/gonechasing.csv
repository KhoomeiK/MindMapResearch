I don't blame you one bit. I have gone through hell with my allergies because of the cats. I had to move out of my house for 3 weeks so I could get allergy tested and guess what, one of the worst reactions I had was to cats. Now I have shots and that helps but I'm still pretty damn allergic to my kids. I have made it abundantly clear to anyone involved in my medical care that my cats are emotionally supportive and I will not be getting rid of them, and I will not be able to keep them off my bed. 

The only reason I have been able to keep all of them is because I'm unable to really work much at the moment and so I have the time to do the work to keep my allergies under control. Not everyone has that ability.

I've found that in regards to animals  begging, if you give them some while you're eating and they like it, they get super obnoxious. If you share after you've had your fill, or leave the last bit for them, they learn that if they're patient they get rewards at the end.
