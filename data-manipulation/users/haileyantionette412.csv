She is also very open, if I ask her something about her past that could be triggering she answers honestly and then asks why I asked. We always have good conversations and I feel that I can tell her anything and everything (literally) without judgement. She’s there when I mess up and she’s there when I succeed. It can’t be an easy job being a mom and I know my mom has made mistakes with us kids before. But she learns from them and she does better the next time. I think her being there whenever she is needed is what makes her an amazing mom. But to have a good relationship she is there even when she is not needed. I know my mom would always be there in a heartbeat no matter what is happening. If I just wanted some company she would come over. Last week I was leaving her house to come back to my apartment and my tire blew out. She was on her way to bed and it was about midnight. I called the house and she answered. She put on some pants and her robe, hopped in her car, and came and got me. She wasn’t upset about it at all. She was just happy that I was safe and that I would be home for the night. There’s no perfect way to be the best mom. All that is needed is presence and effort."

offmychest,fe0kogf,t1_fe0kllx,1578815102.0,How long was it before it was less severe for you?
offmychest,fd572lz,t1_fd56hl4,1578174848.0,I’m proud of yours too! I had to share because I think everyone has their thing that they do during their hard times. Another thing that I’ve been doing recently since I fell back into a depression is literally writing down every thought I have. So that I can fully acknowledge it and then release it. And origami is also just really hecking cool.
offmychest,fd54hu8,t3_ejuxbw,1578174136.0,I had a phase in my life where I would find quotes that I related to and I would screenshot them and then sit in my room for hours on my bed writing these quotes out with sharpie. They were beautiful. I then taped them to my wall and if I switched rooms in the house they always followed me. I always had my quote wall. Eventually when I got out of that funk of not liking who I was I took them down and got rid of them. It’s amazing how people find comfort in such amazingly weird things that most people don’t do.
