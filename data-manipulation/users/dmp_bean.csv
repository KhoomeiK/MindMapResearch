Maybe they don’t LIKE to eat their steak that way, but it is literally the only way they CAN eat it. 

Are organ recipients not deserving of steaks because they would be “wasting it”?"
coolguides,ffe7wm2,t1_ffdkqpp,1579839108.0,Have you ever had to tell off a snotty chef with this reasoning? How do they usually respond? I would pay to watch that reaction.
dogs,fejxdzu,t1_fejsu5l,1579188031.0,"Wow, and I thought we had it rough with my dog. Kudos to you for figuring out your system and managing it so well!"
unpopularopinion,fei4c8w,t1_fehgvk1,1579129996.0,"You’d be surprised. You’ll want any and all pictures. You’ll be wishing you’d installed a live 24/7 camera just following that person around, to just see the mundane things. You’re not going to give a shit if they’re the fondest memories, you’ll just want memories."
unpopularopinion,fei3utg,t3_ep2slk,1579129691.0,"First of all, I don’t think you can dictate what takes away intimacy from another person’s moments. Taking a video of a personal moment also doesn’t necessarily detract from that moment. And you know what? If you’ve lost that person, guess how BADLY you’re going to wish you had taken a picture or video of that memory. Guess how badly you’re going to want to share that special moment with anyone who will listen. It’s a way to make new memories and keep that person alive.

My boyfriend was in the hospital a few weeks ago. It was for something as small as food poisoning and I was already panicking and freaking out. When I was up at 3am, still panicking, and had exhausted all the people I could tell, I turned to reddit to rant and it made me feel so much better just knowing someone out there was listening. Even random internet strangers. I can’t imagine if I had been losing him. I also tend to be conservative with social media, but when you’re under such extreme stress and you feel so alone, you just never know. I surprised myself that week. 

Also, way to go using that poor guy’s post to karma farm. You couldn’t even wait a few days? Let the dust settle? You were so absolutely disgusted by his post you had to turn around a mere few hours later and write a nice long rant about it, and link the guy’s post and pretty much call him out directly? Shit, she probably hasn’t even passed yet. You’re no different, if you think about it. Why not just rant about it with your family and friends? Why rant to reddit anyway?"
dogs,feeaewm,t1_fee9tbh,1579029705.0,"Ooof yeah in that case, big shame :("
dogs,fee9jga,t1_fee5we5,1579029195.0,"Ah I understand that to an extent, but it sounds like the stepson having allergies wasn’t an issue (correct me if I’m wrong here). And the reason they gave up the dog is because the other son had an undiagnosed allergy to the dog. Unless I’m missing something and the stepson having allergies was also part of the problem."
dogs,fee43th,t3_eomrod,1579025988.0,"I agree!! But I’m just confused as to what was wrong about the first situation? Not pushing back, just genuinely trying to understand. It seems like it was the right thing to do if a family member was severely allergic and these allergies didn’t appear until you’ve had the dog? I know some allergies take a while to set in, like meeting a dog is fine but living with your allergen day in and day out is what really causes the allergic response so it would take having your dog before realizing this. What should they have done in this situation?"
dogs,fdqepu9,t3_emnqy7,1578664742.0,"My dog’s name is Maizey. Every family member calls her something different..

Me: Bubby Maize, Bubby Stinky, Bubby 
Boyfriend: Da Maize 
Mom: Bubbaloo, Midgey 
Dad: Pookie (he also called me this as a baby), Midgey
Brother: Baby stinky 

Really we only call her Maizey when we’re in public or when she’s in trouble xD"
dogs,fcpnv6n,t1_fcpcmyq,1577868340.0,"I second this. My dog was like this at this age, and she still struggles with it currently (but she’ll still young). It’ll take a lot of patience. My dog even used to and still occasionally does throw these wonderful tantrums where she starts flipping around and biting her leash like a mad dog. 

Redirection with treats is what helped me. Very high value treats. Have a good sit or down trained and when things get a little too wild whip out a treat and have them sit. If they go mad trying to bite your hand off with the treat, throw it on the ground. Hopefully that will at least break the biting craze long enough for you to get their attention back to, ooh treats if I do tricks!"
AmItheAsshole,fcplbec,t1_fcpkqie,1577866812.0,"Haha. And to think in the midst of waiting for the ambulance when my boyfriend was likely thumping on the floor from the pain and my dog was losing her goddamn mind howling, I actually felt a prickle of “oh no, the neighbors might be disturbed by this”."
AmItheAsshole,fcpkh0g,t1_fcpi9gs,1577866318.0,"It was definitely the strangest and most unsettling interaction I’ve ever had. We didn’t even open the door and just spoke through the door, since it was 2am, a stranger from this new apartment complex in the new city we had just moved into, and a super weird ass reason to be banging on the door."
AmItheAsshole,fcpk5s1,t1_fcpjoex,1577866143.0,I am... I probably just need to do some deep breathing exercises.I just wish they would have warned us. I could have made arrangements to make sure my bf got some rest.
dogs,fcpjbjf,t3_ei9ert,1577865656.0,"I’m in a mood today, so I am SO infuriated on your behalf. Adult sized tantrum is right, and I probably would have started having one right there. Kudos to you for holding it in and being civil. Nothing is more infuriating than wasting money on something to help your pet that doesn’t even work. These things are already expensive and it’s painful spending the money all over again on another option! (Well for most people I would assume). It’s hard to find something great on the first try, but it’s infuriating nonetheless when it isn’t working out. ESPECIALLY when these people are THIS DENSE!!  Good luck!"
dogs,fb33fmb,t1_fb1x6a1,1576463375.0,Another good one I’ve heard on the internet is “SCHLUCK SCHLUCK”.
