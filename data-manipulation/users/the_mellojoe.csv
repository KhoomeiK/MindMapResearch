Also, are you familiar with the book series ""His Dark Materials""?  ""The Golden Compass""?   There is a mechanic of the human's soul taking the form of an animal spirit companion.  They describe what happens if you are separated from that spirit companion.  It feels like a crazy rubberband stretching and pulling at you, getting worse and worse the further the separation.

So, I plugged in Ancient Red Dragon and a Party of 5.  Then I adjusted the level until the ""daily budget"" matched the ""adjusted xp"" of the creatures.  So, after a long rest, with only a single fight on the horizon, a party of 5 level 13 players could manage an Ancient Red Dragon.

Now, this is very rough math.  But, it looks like it compares similarly to u/VampirateRum's estimate as well.

 KoboldFightClub still labels this a ""deadly"" encounter even up through level 19.  Which means, no matter how you slice it, this is going to be rough for any party.  Level 13 would be the absolute minimum with level 19 the top of the estimate of when it becomes less deadly.  Throw out the top and bottom and you end up with a range of level 14 - level 18.

DarkSouls2,feh9hjn,t3_ep592x,1579111933.0,"DS2 feels like a slower game.  Defensive tactics felt stronger than aggressive ones (DS3 brings back the aggressive paths, btw).  ADP (Agility) for rolling is HUGE.  Make sure you get your Agility up, because those dodge rolls are even more powerful.  Be patient.  Something about DS2 rewards patience.    It is just as linear as the other games, but the ""map"" is not laid out in any kind of intuitive way.  It will feel confusing at times to learn the route to take, and somethings might not make sense from a logic standpoint (there's a windmill where you take an elevator and end up in a volcano .... just go with it).  

The game is super solid.  PvP is really diverse, and there is a dedicated area to jump into PvP outside of invasions and fight clubs.  Which is nice because people like me who don't normally do PvP have a space where we can go to try it out and try out differnt builds and not feel like we are screwing up our game in the process.    DS2 has some memorable bosses, too.  DS3 brought back a lot of fan favorites, but DS2 was trying to be unique and so there are some unique fights.  Some are cool, and some don't exactly work as well as the DS1 and DS3 bosses, but the game feels unique in that way.   Several bosses have different ways you can approach the fight, too, so replayability is built in.  Making another character and trying different things can end up with a different experience (>!Chariot, Lost Sinner, Earthen Peak come to mind!<).

Yes, of course, the C7 is beautiful too, but you will get .... widebody envy.  I have a narrowbody C6 and I definitely look at the widebody cars thinking how good they look. The C7 Stingray is the base narrowbody variant of that car.  Which means, every time you see a C7 Z or GS you'll get that same feeling that yours could have looked like that.  

The C6 have really stabled in pricing, so you can recover most of your costs in a year or 2 if you change your mind.  You can find great deals on C6 GS, and end up with the bargain of the century for a phenomenal car, massive capability, and super easy drivability.    But that's just my opinion.  

Now, if the choice was between a C6 Z and a C7 Grand Sport?  Ok, that would be tougher choice, and I might have to lean toward the C7 there."
