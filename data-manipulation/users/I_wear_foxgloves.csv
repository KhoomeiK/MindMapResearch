mycology,ffidni7,t1_ffhlvg2,1579971380.0,"The twenty pound harvest was accomplished by my dog, and the dogs of two colleagues. Detection work is tiring, so I won’t work Rhu for more than three hours at a time. Some sites are so prolific that we can harvest pounds in an hour or two, but often the truffles are few and far between and require lots of wandering to locate. As such, when you’re supplying big orders you call in your friends!"
mycology,ffid6un,t1_ffico1n,1579971068.0,"Dogs know the difference between residual odor and live odor, so no, that wouldn’t be your best option unless you want the dog to find old nests as well as current.

When we did the gopher project we put scent pads in a container with a live, contained gopher to initially teach the dog, but then exposed her to a live gopher and increased reward value. This way she didn’t spend her time finding old burrows.

With the turtle nests we trained her to find turtle urine since the female turtle saturates the nest site with urine before digging the egg chamber. I thought this was so cool!"
mycology,ffiby90,t1_ffibrc5,1579970228.0,"In fact yes, but that project never progressed to the point that we were engaged. I would LOVE to do it, though, and it would be incredibly simple to train!"

dogswithjobs,ffiaxah,t1_ffhj6qk,1579969519.0,"I was a wilderness search and rescue K9 handler for 11 years (a volunteer activity), also doing HRD (Human Remains Detection) work with my dog. Everything took off from there! Volunteering offers many, many rewards, among them a springboard to new careers."

dogswithjobs,ffialhb,t1_ffhq15b,1579969294.0,"Wow, thank you!"
dogswithjobs,ffiai12,t1_ffhvlry,1579969230.0,"I describe black truffle cache as sweet and fruity - like pineapple. White truffle cache is utterly unique, but makes me think of kerosene. Now, I know that doesn’t sound appetizing, but it’s not that the truffle tastes LIKE kerosene, it’s just very gassy and pungent.

Interestingly, truffles are a food that seems to be experienced differently by individual. While I say black truffles as fruity, my husband describes the cache as that of roasted meat; my friend describes it as chocolate; and another friend describes it as reminding her of cheese. They’re fascinating little things!"
dogswithjobs,ffia6ch,t1_ffhwrrp,1579969005.0,"I am a professional detection dog trainer, so I did it at home!

Honestly, this is a very, very easy thing to train, and when I train students takes four training sessions."
dogswithjobs,ffia2ak,t1_ffhwt9j,1579968926.0,"I just answered this for another poster, so I’ll just copy that response: That’s a training problem that can be fixed! When I train dogs I keep the scent contained so that it cannot be eaten, and reward the dog with VERY high value treats (I used little chunks of beef and chicken). Timing is critical - when the dog gives the indication on the odor the treat is tossed on top of the spot. The dog, thus, never learns that eating the truffle is even an option. As training progresses the dog is only given the reward when I am holding the truffle IN my hand, meaning if dog eats it, no reward, and the soft warm meat chunks is much tastier than the cold, hard, wet fungus."

You spoke in the past tense, so I assume you are no longer in the area and no longer have the dog (I’m sorry...), but managing this problem is very doable!"

dogswithjobs,ffi8r8k,t1_ffi18kr,1579968005.0,"It’s an underground fungal spore with a unique odor/flavor that is prized by chefs. Most people who know of truffles associate them with high end European cuisine, and think of them being hunted by pigs.

It turns out that truffles are not unique to Europe, but are found on most continents, and dogs do a better job finding them than pigs."
mycology,ffi7ztd,t1_ffi4kku,1579967464.0,"I’ll happily ship you truffles, but they have a very short shelf life, so must be shipped over night. My assumption is that this would make them cost prohibitive."

mycology,ffi7qol,t1_ffhlgn3,1579967285.0,I work under contract for any agency or biologist who has a project that can benefit from scent detection. Rhu is trained to find the nests of two endangered pond turtles so that protective cages can be placed over them; she is trained to differentiate the burrow opening of an endangered prairie gopher; and she is trained to find the scat of a fox species that is being counted for potential listing as endangered. I will happily pimp my dog out for any activity that supports ecology!
mycology,ffi7ix5,t1_ffhhenw,1579967131.0,"Many of us who forage truffles out here would happily ship them, but, as you note, without being in the area we are limited in our ability to develop that market. Also, few chefs out of our region are familiar with the cache of west coast truffles, and I assumed would be looking for odor/flavor more redolent of European varieties. More relevant, perhaps, is that truffles have a very short shelf life (Oregon black truffles only last 4-6 days out of the ground), so they would have to be shipped over night, which I assume would make them too expensive."
