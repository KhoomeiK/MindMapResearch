I don’t really believe that Dany would’ve had an issue marrying Jon but reigning as Queen. He didn’t want the power anyway. He could be her consort/advisor. If she was a good queen then people wouldn’t really be advocating for Jon to be the ultimate ruler. They both had a blood claim. 

I do see why there would be tension though. And actually, had they utilized an entire season, it would’ve been good realistic drama. Jon and Dany are married, Danys on the throne, but there are factions who think Jon has a better claim and would be a better ruler, so there’s plotting. Dany grows to distrust Jon and her council, even though he’s loyal and loves her, making her unstable and violent, so Jon has to exile or kill her and take the throne he never wanted. Similar ending, but it would be way more tragic and believable if it was stretched out over a season."

This student is friendly with the teachers and joking around, but it’s normally considered disrespectful, rude, and a punishable offense to call a teacher by their first name. It’s saying, “you’re on the same level as me, as the other students.”

AskReddit,fg2omnf,t1_fg1lxq9,1580450054.0,I don’t know why guys agree to a mmf threesome if they’re not attracted to men or willing to explore. I guess if they’re into the girl and willing to share. But it would kill the mood. Most girls in a ffm threesome will play with the other girl. Probably due to our society’s unfair double standards about female sexuality being fluid whereas if a guy even thinks about another dude then he’s automatically gay.
AskReddit,fg2o9hg,t1_fg1b387,1580449712.0,I think some people that want a threesome already have a specific person in mind. Probably because they’re attracted to them and it feels safe to have sex with them with the permission and participation of their existing partner. Or they want someone they know and trust. Unfortunately this seems to lead to heartbreak a lot of times if the couple doesn’t thoroughly discuss their feelings and boundaries first. Also sex work is criminalized in a lot of places.
