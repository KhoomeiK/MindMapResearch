smiledirectclub,fcmecpo,t1_fcmczq9,1577772193.0,"Thank you for your quick response.  I was also concerned about the amount of movement in the front, but did not notice that the front teeth weren't touching in the model!  I just found I could zoom in.

As for myself, I did have orthodontic treatment (adjustable retainers) as a kid and would not be opposed to going with a formal treatment plan with an ortho for her.  She was approved for Invisalign, and I thought they were the same.  Plus, we are looking for something that will straighten but also not interfere with her band, she plays the sax.  

Thanks again."
