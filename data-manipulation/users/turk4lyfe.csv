worldnews,fg7cvu3,t1_fg77bew,1580589462.0,I think a serious minority of Republican voters want this to happen. I think the vast majority do not care simply because they lack the intelligence to understand the situation. If you know any Republicans in real life try asking them the reasons Trump was impeached or even ask if they can name the three branches of government. They can't.
