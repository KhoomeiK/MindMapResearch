NarcissisticAbuse,ffy9q9l,t1_fft7zcx,1580341335.0,"Like you just spoke the words that I've been repeating to myself for the past 2 years. 

I don't know what made it click when I one day realize that I didn't actually get any joy from him. It was like being addicted to the high of trying to be good enough to earn his approval. Then I realized I didn't even know if I had my own. that's when the veil begin to part and I was starting to realize that he was building me into something that I had never even agreed to or was okay with."
NarcissisticAbuse,ffy9g19,t1_ffuhbqq,1580341172.0,"Absolutely. I know personally how difficult it is to recover from narcissism. I just want you to know that you WILL be okay.... it takes time and you have to tough out the rough patch to get to the sunshine at the end but, it is definitely there. I can speak from experience, it will often feel like your darkest hour but in truth it is only temporary.

You can do this. Believe in your ability to be better than the situation because you absolutely deserve a chance to breathe."
AskReddit,ffy99u2,t1_ffxfqj8,1580341070.0,"Oh yes, now that I'm a tax-paying adult I occasionally get my voice heard. Thank you for your kind words.


I'm going to start advocating for teenagers being listened to and treated more seriously especially in cases of domestic abuse cuz I'm not even the only one that I know personally or have heard of who's been through something similar.

 I just I think it's very wrong that are you should have to suffer because the adults who could save them would rather turn a blind eye because it's too much trouble or they don't want to deal with it."
NarcissisticAbuse,ffxfhtd,t1_ffub0rh,1580324094.0,"Thank you. I really needed to hear that. The illusion started breaking for me a couple of years ago, and I just started gradually drifting from him after that
He was NOT happy about it but I ended up cutting him out and moving on. It's still hard and there are days that I wonder what I should've or could've done differently, but then I read posts on this thread and it reminds me that he would've just gaslit me like he always did, and I remember how I felt. Like I was caught in a never ending loop of circling the drain.

I'm rebuilding myself now. It's taken lots of time and effort, but I wanted to be whole again and to recognize myself when I look in the mirror.

I appreciate your support and everyone who posts here."

Bruises. I had bruises as a kid. But no, I was just a punk, even though I had decent grades and no record and my stepdad and mother had both racked up records of sexual and physical abuse, drugs, and credit card fraud.

NarcissisticAbuse,fft6ora,t3_ev2kjb,1580209893.0,"I understand. My friends said that I wasn't myself anymore after I started talking to my Nex.

It gets better, it just takes time. Reconnect to the things and people that you loved BEFORE you met him. Trust me, your true self still exists deep down and is still beautiful.

He's just covering it with shitty cheap makeup because he thinks it looks better that way. Because he has no idea what beauty really is.

You're not being narcissistic or attention-seeking, you're crying out for help, and that's what this sub is for. Realizing that your situation isn't what you want is the first (and hardest) step to recovery.

You can do this. And please, ask for help. It's ok. He will make you think it's not ok. But you need support. Use whatever pronouns you need to, no one outside of his little bubble will see you so negatively.

Get out, save yourself, recover your own life.

More so in real life. I am beginning to understand the theory that sometimes kids can bring out the best in people.

But it's painful when you see someone without kids that don't have some other purpose, and they just slowly degrade into a snobby self deprecating mess.
