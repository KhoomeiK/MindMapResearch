NotHowDrugsWork,fdyr4rp,t1_fdyhm3o,1578782751.0,Yep you’re spot on.  I’ve had bad-trip level shitty times on weed.  Like *borderline* psychosis.  And I’ve also had dumb thoughts and actions *along* these lines.  But we can assume this is just a dumb fake text.

AmItheAsshole,fdticuj,t1_fdsrxij,1578717181.0,"This is 100% fake.  No one in the real world thinks like this.  It’s written to provoke anger, thereby getting upvotes"
AmItheAsshole,fdj7vdv,t1_fdhndfm,1578460944.0,"Haha my grandma comes up with a new excuse to give me money every time!  I visit her a couple times a year with my mom.   Usually we see her for a few days, and often at some point I go out for a walk or go to the coffee shop, just to have some time to myself and wander around.  Before I go, my grandma will suddenly pull out a $50 bill and say “oh here’s some money for coffee”.  She is the most giving, and caring person I know."
Stress,fdiqzgk,t1_fdinepf,1578449082.0,Thank you!!  Your support truly means a lot to me.  It’s a good reminder to steer my mind in the right direction.
Stress,fdhpvjf,t1_fdhoqtp,1578427803.0,"Absolutely!  I fully agree.  It’s a huge leap outside my comfort zone, which is what pushes me to do it.  I have a lot to work on in terms of confidence and social skills, so this will give me the right skills and more to prepare me for adult life and university"
Stress,fdhn3es,t1_fdhl8ao,1578426145.0,"Yes for sure, but a big part is the fact of becoming part of a group of people I’ve never met.  I have to take the leap of faith and fly across the country before I even know who I’ll be spending the next five months with.  This is terrifying, but I also do know that it’ll likely be the most transformative experience of my life so far.  I am very insecure about how I look (a lot of people think I’m a lot younger than I am), and my personality."

socialanxiety,fdh001c,t3_el8o5f,1578412386.0,Other way around for me.  I was a “chatter box” and I realized how annoying people found me once I was 13-14 so I became very quiet and now I’m left with so much insecurity and anxiety it sucks
PsychedSubstance,fdf8ezx,t1_fdf7v4q,1578355710.0,"Oh is that right?  That’s cool.  I guess because I only know the logo from psychedsubstance, I just think of it as an LSD symbol.  I can’t get one right now but I’m hoping they’ll still be available in a couple months.  That’s honestly dope asf that only people who are in this community will recognize it, which is a great way to make connections with people you haven’t discussed psychedelics with."
PsychedSubstance,fdf45k4,t1_fde4yxj,1578352887.0,"Ah nice.  Do people comment on it, or give you weird looks?"
Psychonaut,fday7ta,t3_ekeicl,1578251715.0,"This is the moment in history where the new wave as begun.  We got this.  But we can’t identify as hippies, or a similar classification.  Hippies have a bad reputation in this day and age.  Hippies are associated with essential oil, anti-vax, stoned people who think they’re spiritual.  People don’t listen to hippies, they’re seen as being out of touch with reality.  

We need to start a movement as being science-based, positive, open-minded, down-to-earth people who want change for the greater good of society.  Psychedelics are amazing tools we utilize, but they do not compose the basis of our movement.

We don’t aim to break free of society.  We strive to push for a more positive and free society.  We want to be valued members of society.

So where do we start?  First thing is to unify ourselves.  Form our core values and goals.  Label ourselves with a name we agree on.  Then we need to start conversation.  Get our voice out there and have rational and productive conversations.  Push for policy change.  Facilitate scientific research to show why legalization of psychedelics is so important."
AskReddit,fd7kanl,t3_ek3hna,1578205821.0,"I would make the duck population of every pond form a a choir, and would harmoniously quack the melody of a recognizable song (I’ve gotta figure that part out).  They would form a line, and bob their heads in unison.  Then they would slowly paddle ashore and serenade people.  This ordeal would last 5-10 minutes.  Enough time to draw everyone’s attention, but not long enough for many people to be arriving just to view the spectacle.  Scientists would surely study every possible reason for the occurrence, but the only record of this taking place would be preserved on witness’s phone cameras.  The mystery would go unsolved.  For centuries to come, there would never be an explanation."
AskReddit,fd3is4x,t1_fczb21y,1578158720.0,"Is this just a US thing?  I’m from Bulgaria and this is typical entertainment from street performers.  The common courtesy is to throw a coin and they’ll do the classic trick of donut-bounce and catch it in the foreskin.  I used to be pretty good at the dance when I was younger, and even got a standing ovation at the talent show.  Damn the US must be a weird and boring ass place to live if literally just dancing is socially unacceptable"
socialanxiety,fcyc9f1,t1_fcy6vru,1578077918.0,"I struggle with all of those besides public speaking, interestingly enough.  Thank god for the internet, because otherwise I doubt I’d be able to identify my core issue of social anxiety.  Although I haven’t yet searched for treatment, just knowing what condition I have which causes the way I feel and act helps a ton.  And knowing that other people are overcoming these same issues makes it a lot easier"
rant,fcumx1k,t1_fcu8ini,1577984434.0,Finding them attractive is normal.  Almost every dude does.  There’s little difference between a 17 year old girl and an 18 year old girl.  But seeking young girls out is what makes you a pedo.
WatchRedditDie,fct5pwk,t3_eilmk6,1577933560.0,r/BasedGenZ is removed.  Not sure what was even on that sub as I only tried to check it out now
Psychonaut,fcsza9c,t1_fcsxs9c,1577928849.0,"I’d definitely recommend you to try it at some point!  That is given the right circumstances.  As long as you and accurately dose, you should have a good time.  Also a lot of people don’t realize that set and setting still applies.  A small group of close friends in a quiet environment is ideal for the first time."
Psychonaut,fcst9ib,t1_fcsq94g,1577924534.0,"Absolutely.  I feel VERY fortunate to have this knowledge before I might have ended up going too far.  I don’t personally believe any drug is worth doing unless there is a positive prolonged effect, or gained perspective.  This is why I’ll never try benzos, coke, or opioids.  Some would argue alcohol should be placed under this umbrella, but I feel like alcohol is too prevalent to avoid altogether.  And a drink or two can facilitate socializing when used responsibly.

Unlike alcohol, the bonding between friends from an MDMA session can be felt for long after the experience.  And for some people like myself, the afterglow can be felt within the individual for some time following the experience.  This is a beautiful way to change one’s consciousness, which can’t be taken advantage of by casual use.  It can be such a valuable experience so abuse is never worth it."
Psychonaut,fcsrlt4,t1_fcspwx9,1577923340.0,"Ah okay.  It was a light tan colored powder (consisting of small crystals).  My guess is that it was pure in the way of not cut with anything, however there was likely a small percentage of contaminants from an imperfect synthesis"
Psychonaut,fcsq7yf,t1_fcsn7b3,1577922344.0,"I’m sorry to hear that.  An unfortunate but understandable mistake.  I always lean far to the safe side when using drugs, so I plan to have a session every three months max.  I might do it twice during the summer, but will take a long break afterwords.  

It’s a difficult thing to touch a drug which makes me feel like my best self and have to put it down for such a long time after.  But I only allowed myself to try it with the strict condition to use it responsibly and not let it interfere with the life I have now.  Many people try a drug once, and immediately add it to their repertoire of regular drugs.  I have a few friends with this “addictive personality” and it’s quite sad to see."
Psychonaut,fcspcfu,t1_fcsktsk,1577921720.0,"Thanks.  I definitely underestimated the therapeutic potential of MDMA.  I look forward to using it in the future, in maybe 3-5 months.  I can’t say 100% on the dot, but the people who tested it said the chemical structure matched MDMA, and they could not detect any other compounds."
socialanxiety,fcsfo27,t1_fcsbxew,1577915849.0,"Yeah I find alcohol makes it worse in the long run.  I have a good group of friends who I have fun with, but I find I don’t feel very close to them when we’re sober.  We all like each other’s company and support each other as friends do.  But I feel like our relationship is mainly confined to the context of drinking.  My drunk self can make friends easily, but my sober self can’t really continue the friendship outside of drinking.  A drink or two can be a helpful way to open up with people and get to know other people better, but it doesn’t actually solve any of my problems.  I find I can get to know people well and seemingly get close to people while I’ve had a few drinks, but I can barely acknowledge them while I’m sober."
AskReddit,fcs0ggr,t3_eic8yl,1577909440.0,"Fuckin hell man, now I’ve wasted too much time thinking about this.

I’m finally happy with my life, as of this year.  I’m 17 and I have a lot of really great friends surrounding me.  I never had many friends in the past, besides my best friend I’ve had since kindergarten.  But something changed this year, and when my mind isn’t clouded by anxiety I feel a true sense of contentment.  All of the memories that have formed, all of the people in my life who share those memories — I can’t say it’d be worth the sacrifice.  

But with the mindset I have now, maybe I’d get to truly appreciate my childhood more in the moment.  My life in 8 years would no longer be a mystery, so with this perspective maybe I could value the experiences I had more.  Form deeper relationships with the friends I met along the way.  I could become the best version of myself.  I would have the confidence, maturity, and knowledge to make the right decisions every step of the way.

In the end, I’m just glad this is only a theoretical question and not a dilemma I’d ever be faced with"
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcldl5j,t3_ehbuar,1577745341.0,"This is a question — I don’t know what actually happened here, or the laws on this topic

“Rape” is a very harsh word which can mean many things, in the way that “assault” can refer to a drastic spectrum of crimes, in terms of severity.  If this means that he engaged in any unlawful sexual relations with minors, that would constitute a rape conviction, even if both parties have exchanged consent.  I’d imagine the charges are something along these lines.  The legal system should not use the same terminology for such different crimes (unlawful sexual relations vs unconsensual acts of sexual violence).  Obviously both are heinous crimes committed by people with no morals, but obviously one is less harshly punished than the other."

cigars,fc73qqc,t1_fc73gy0,1577496734.0,"Oh cool that’s great to know.  Are shade grown higher quality, similar to coffee?  Or just a different flavor, better or worse depending on preference?"
