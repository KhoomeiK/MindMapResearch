TwoXChromosomes,ffdo8t1,t3_esriej,1579825092.0,This information disgusts me.
AmItheAsshole,ffdit0p,t3_essrci,1579821765.0,"YTA - Would you even be asking if you didn't already know? 

Who do you even think you are with your absurd request? Did you not notice her bright red butt length hair when you asked her to join your wedding party? 

Suggesting a wig, really? As if she wanted absorb more wedding costs. Just so your ""vision"" wouldn't be ""ruined?!? Just for her to be left with some bullshit wig that she didn't need & doesn't want.

I wouldn't just drop out of your wedding party, I'd excuse myself from your wedding & your entitled way of life."
orangecats,ffb56vy,t1_ff5hzsf,1579752096.0,"It's awesome you saved her from the winter. It's ashamed you couldn't keep her. It's very nice to hear.you were able to give her to family. She'll always love you. We rescued our Cheeto too, it was summer and I spotted his little orange butt in our garden. We also rescued his mama."
opiates,ffarx2u,t3_esc7wj,1579743069.0,"I have to hide my once a week cocaine use from my BIL, he us also my employer and one of my closest friends

Meanwhile,  we both indulge daily on various prescription (ours our street obtained). He's cool with weed (not a drug in either of our opinions) and he/we won't/don't want to give up pills.

Oh but the ass chewing & judgment I would get if he knew I indulge in some cocaine most friday nights. He knows I ""use to"" and I will 100% deny current use it til the end."

opiates,ff6qp85,t3_eru49n,1579632882.0,"I had a spinal fusion in 2008. It came with 10 years of 120 10mg norco. Then bam, cut off with no notice, as my Neurosurgeon retired.
Fast forward to may of this year. My GP who I've been seeing for years prescribed me 21 10mg norco's for a very painful condition,
Hidradenitis suppurativa, HS for short. He gradually started giving me more, I'm up to 120 a month now. I consider myself very lucky. I am prescribed 120 1mg xanax a month and was originally told that I couldn't have both. I lucked out considering how things have changed with prescribing."
orangecats,ff58o54,t1_ff55hom,1579583531.0,Thanks. Not many girl gingers. Mine Cheeto is a boy.

Humira,fcsrbi4,t3_einzjl,1577923133.0,"I (40F) started Humira August 1st 2018 for Hidradenitis suppurativa, HS for short.

I give myself one shot a week. I always get hot flashes. I'm doing very physical work daily. I bust out in crazy sweats. When I sleep I wake up drenched. I have not hit ""the change"" according to the doc. 

Also I have a significantly lower appetite. Honestly I don't even eat all day sometimes, and often not until the following night. 
I've lost about 15lbs.

I hope Humira helps you. Best of luck. 
I've gotten use to the side effects. I hope you can too. Take care"
