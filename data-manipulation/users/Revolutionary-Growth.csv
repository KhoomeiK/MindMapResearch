introvert,ff951gh,t3_escvg7,1579705009.0,"My sleeping patterns are mess since childhood. When I am into something, I tend to stay 20hours+, because I don't like thinking about sleep when I enjoy something. Yesterday I was awake for 25 hours, and I've slept for only 4 hours, but I am this type of a person, who can function even better with less sleep. I just need to be entertained, and I don't need sleep.

Of course how can you expect, I have some problems because of this. I had the worst attendance in my whole school, because I was not sleeping in the night time. Very often nosebleeds in teenage years, because of too less sleep. I've heard in the long run it affects health badly, but I don't care.

Sometimes I sleep normally, or even more than usually, and these times are when I am the least happy.

introvert,ff1s1q4,t1_ff1eaau,1579484909.0,">sometimes and go hang out with friends to keep them going even though I may not feel like it

Damn, I dont like this feeling, when I truly don't want to socialize, but I have to. The worst feeling ever :D That's what I call pretending, because you can't be yourself. When I happy in a good mood, I have a lot of energy naturally to socialize. I would even say I am more willing to do it. But when I am in a bad mood, it's so awful.

That's why I dont like when people are attached to me, because it feels like an obligation. It's terrible, when they visit you, and you are in a bad mood. I recover much faster when I am alone. If I would force myself to socialize, I would probably be complaining and, I would be mean for people. So that's why people usually think I am nice, happy etc, because I tend to socialize only when I am in a good mood.

That's weird, because I am always trying to make sure, people are not attached to me. Most of the people are quite surprised, because I always was a very nice person, but they didnt know, I was not confident, I was suppressing a lot of stuff. I was constantly saying what they wanted to hear. It was taking so much energy."
introvert,ff1dlyl,t3_er4cno,1579477819.0,"I completely agree. I've always been extremely resistant to loneliness, tbh I am not even sure if I have experienced that. I would say, it is more like boredom in my case. My need for social connection/stimulation is extremely low. Reddit is enough to sate my need to expressing myself.

I am more honest IRL recently, and with time I am becoming a loner. I am not sure, if I am doing right, but I have to trust myself. I started telling people, I dont want to talk, I prefer to be alone etc. So they stopped communicating with me. I stopped pleasing people and pretend I am normal and social. I have almost no friends, I feel good, but not sure how it will affect me in the long run. I think I will be fine, I feel better and more free recently. I am confident, because I don't need to pretend, and I don't care what people think about me.

pureo,ff16w8a,t1_ff0n3yu,1579475836.0,">I have gone through the worst case scenario but sometimes I wonder if thinking about the worst case scenario is a form of reassurance?

You know how can you find out? What makes you nervous the most? If you are going through the worst case scenario, and there is still no progress, it means you face it improperly. It's still huge progress, but you can find your other sensitive points, to make even more progress. You will be cured in my opinion, when these thoughts will stop occuring, or you will be completely fine with these thoughts without seeking reassurance.

To this day I can have some hidden protective mechanisms, but I am always trying to catch them and face it. For example, I still have some insecurity that if I will be drunk, or under influence of something I can do it. I trust myself, but I have problems trusting myself under influence of something. I was drinking at times, but I feel uncomfortable about losing control. Maybe I will buy some alcohol, and go for it. Still I feel insecure about it, so I will do it slowly.

I will not be an alcoholic, it's for therapy's purposes :)"
pureo,ff0lxfz,t1_ff0ehms,1579470136.0,"Mental reassurance is the most difficult part. It took me a bit longer to overcome it. I don't know what type of ocd do you have, but in my case I accepted I can be depressed. I let myself to be depressed, and do not fight with these thoughts.

You have to be okay with the consequences. In my case, I started being okay with the death, everyone will die at some point, so I thought if I will have a reason to do it earlier, ok then... You will be less likely to seek reassurance then. If you have harm ocd towards the others, you have to accept the worst case scenario, and be okay with that. In my case I always knew, I am not depressed, because:

\-People with depression deliberately think about these actions.

\-I realized we are scared of things we care the most. So it's the opposite to doing that.

\-I was scoring very low on depression tests.

\-I've always wanted to live.

At this point, I knew I didn't have depression. So I knew, it was pure ocd. I was making exposure therapy with keeping in mind ""I am truly safe""

I don't need to seek reassurance here or something, I just show you how you can do it. Now you have to convince yourself, why it's pureo. With me, I just knew it was irrational, because I didnt have depression. Pureo is irrational, you can find logical contradictions. When you will find it, you will have strong beliefs, and then will be easier to face it, but remember accept the worst."
introvert,few4y9d,t1_fev68rr,1579405441.0,"Yep, I think people are like an addiction. You can learn to live without it, and at some point you don't need it any longer. If somebody is very social,  worse withdrawal symptoms xD"

I dont need to hear like people complain, praise or talk about themsleves only. I dont need to wonder what I can say. When I was talking about myself, they didnt even care.

bipolar,fetzrmu,t1_fepuc5n,1579381675.0,"Maybe you are right, but I just feel like depression is a serious thing, and should not be confused with low energy and fatigue.

I just dont dont think I fit criteria to be diagnosed with depression at any point of my life. I have some of these symptoms then and now, but everyone does right? When I was reading posts of people with depression, they sounded irrational and negative as fuck. They hate/dislike everything, they feel worthless, they want to kill themselves, they are sad, they dont see positive things/solutions, they constantly complain etc.

But my mother was diagnosed with depression in the past, and she said the doc was wrong. I would say my low moments looks like: I am apathetic, everything seems to be so boring, I dont feel emotions, I JUST WANT FEEL MORE ALIVE!!!, whats the point of living a boring life, why my body is in ""sleep"" mode, I know why, because life is boring!!!! My heart rate is like 50, but tbh is always like that. Once I had 44. My body is sleeping, so I need some stress to wake up my body and fuctioning better :) I love stress and adrenaline. I am the person who is achieving much more under pressure and stress, because my concentration and energy improves.

There are some positives of low moments tho. I am the best meditator ever, because my mind is empty. I never feel lonely, guilty, shameful etc. because I dont care about these things.

I prefer to live a quite stressful life, otherwise I would go crazy. I am looking for ways to boost my stress hormones naturally. Sleep deprivation boosts adrenaline and stress hermone, so I dont feel tired mentally. Also caffeine boosts that.

"" **Feeling better** after **less sleep** – including after getting **less** Deep or REM **sleep** – could be the result of your body trying to compensate for **sleep** deprivation. When you're short on **sleep**, your body releases stress hormones the next day and evening. These hormones supply the sensation of alertness""

That's why I can feel better. When I had stressful episodes in my life, there were the moments where I was feeling motivated and awesome. I was in my ""hyper"" awesome mode. I know, I am fucked up, and I am destorying my health, but I can't live in other ways. I am quite calculative tho, so I never do things that are too risky. I am always rational to some extent. So I never do any hard drugs, because I know it's too risky in my case.

Some weird things are happening to my heart recently, I guess too much coffee and disturbed sleep. I will rest a bit more, and I will lower my caffeine intake.

I am writing about myself a lot. But how are you :P how your life is going recently, I am curious. Can you write a bit about your mood, feelings and life recently? :)"
bipolar,fendrt5,t1_femu1c4,1579282517.0,"I was wondering about making an appointment with a doc due to my extreme fatigue at times. Yawning/fatigue so often it's not normal. I thought it's related to physical health, because I've never felt like I had depression. I've never wanted to harm myself (that's stupid), I dont feel guilt or shame, I don't feel much anxiety, even if I feel anxiety it makes me happier sooner or later, because I am less tired and bored. Changes in my life are triggering.

I've been having this fatigue for many years. I remember when I was saying about it to people like 7-8 years ago, but no one was understanding what I meant by ""mental fatigue"". With time I learned it disappears when I am really into something, but usually I am getting bored very fast, and I am falling back into my mental fatigue.

I just know, it can't be too stable, because sooner or later I experience too much fatigue/boredom and apathy. I don't care about labels that much, I just want to learn what can alleviate my tiredness, and make me happier. So far: Stress, running, adrenaline, coffee, achieving goals, self-development, making breaks from stuff, stronger emotions in general. I test weird sleeping patterns recently.

>Do you use any other stimulants besides coffee?

Nope. Okay, I go to sleep. 24h awake, I am so tired.

Edit: fuck this stupid shit, I was trying to fall asleep, but suddenly one person started making fucking noises, and it pissed me off. I would not fall asleep anyway. When I started drinking coffee after break, I started having insomnia. Fuck this stupid sleep and this stupid shit, I will make another cup of coffee and do something cool. I will not be wasting my time trying forcing myself to go sleep. I am angry!!! which means I will be happy in a moment, because I am weird. What's more I have run 15 miles today, but my body doesnt give a fuck about sleeping, ok then...

Edit: I am thinking about cutting off coffee. It makes me feel better and energizes me, but later I feel even more tired mentally, and I need more and more. I cant focus on anything, I am wasting my time doing unproductive stuff. I cant focus on watching or reading something, because I am constantly thinking about something.

The same with other activities, I have problems to stop doing them, so most of them time I go 24h+. The problem is, I am overusing my body, and I tend to not eat or staying hydrated properly. And I am neglecting other things too much sometimes, because I can be so much into something. A few days ago, I drank 5 cups of coffee after 14 days of caffeine detox, and I was awake for 30 hours, and later I've slept for only 3 hours waking up energized.

I dont feel like I am in hypnomanic episode rn, but I am awake for 21 hours already, I don't want to stop listening music and read/doing stuff. I have drunk 4 cups of coffee today.

When I am kinda manic, I feel fullfilled and awesome. I've never feel bored during this time, everything is so interesting.

Do you have problems with boredom when your life is too stable?

self,feezmnl,t1_feeum0a,1579044738.0,"The nosebleed is a sign of tiredness in my case. I have this since being a kid. When I have disturbed sleep, because of things like stuffy nose, or when I don't rest properly in general, it occurs only then. Previous day I've slept for only 2 hours and later I was awake for 24 hours. In addition to stuffy nose, it resulted in a bleeding nose. It doesn't indicate anything bad about my health, its a natural reaction in my case. My body says, I don't rest properly when it happens. Except for today, the last time when I had nosebleed was 5-6 months ago, so it's okay.

I will be experimenting with sleeping. I am going to buy some products that can help with stuffy nose at night. I was testing one product in the past, and it was much better. I was not waking up with headaches, and I was breathing better at night. I am positive :}

They should understand if an introvert has a bad day, they want to be alone and recharge. Forced interactions might make them feel even worse.

Conversations with dentists are easy, because usually its all about the teeth/treatment and during the treatment, you can not talk anyway. So it's easy.

introvert,fdu8cyi,t3_en2zp0,1578729354.0,"I am the same, its very monotone with shallow emotions or fast and vague. When I was a kid, I was going to a speech therapist. At some point even teachers spotted I was probably going to a speech therapist, because I've made a huge progress, but unfortunately with time I started speaking unclearly again. I was listening my voice recently, and I realized I am speaking very unclearly. Some people said that in the past, but I thought they were exaggerating.

 Now I am trying to focus on that and improve."

I feel like introverts are better at reading people, because we tend to analyze people and conversations a bit more deeper than the rest. We usually have some purpose when we are socializing. We had to analyze people since young age in order to fit in. Also personally I never feel lonely, I just don't need people. They might be a part of some entertainment, but they are not needed."

If you dont like football, then you can try to explain to your father you are not into these things.

I would advise you to try it. Ask if you can play. They probably want more people to play. I remember we've always had problems to find people to play, so it was cool if someone wanted to play.

introvert,fdqgjti,t1_fdpz3oe,1578666116.0,"I can relate, I've heard people saying ""everything was fine before"", but that's because I was adjusting my personality to their. I wanted to come across as a nice and likeable person, so I was suppressing my bad opinions and what I truly was thinking. In the long run, it doesnt work, because it's just matter of time, when it will explode. With time I was cutting off contact, stopped responding etc. It was just too overwhelming.

Now I am just trying to be myself and don't pretend. Some people criticize me a lot, but I feel great when I dont need to pretend. Pretending like you are social, normal and cool, takes a lot of energy. I am a realist, I am not so social like most of the people, I dont even want any friendships/relationships, so ..."

Regarding to the rest of your post, I've read somewhere 

>The Genetic Basis for **Introversion** It also determines many personality traits, such as your tendency toward **introversion** or extroversion. This correlation is so strong that Laney says children show their **introversion**/extroversion tendency **from** the moment they're born. ... **Introverts**' brains are far less driven **by** dopamine 

So maybe you are an ambivert? it means you have extroverted and introverted moments. I was socially withdrawn since being a kid, but it doesnt mean I didnt enjoy socializing and spending time with other people. Hovewer, most of the time I wanted to be a loner. What is interesting, I am not sure if I have ever felt lonely in my entire life. Of course if I am interested in someone/something, I enjoy spending time with them. It's more interesting to eat or watch funny films with someone. I enjoy hearing interesting stories, but unfortunately most of the time people are talking about trivial things or complaining.

self,fdlp66v,t3_em0l6o,1578529178.0,"Yeah, its good to take care of that. As a kid I was not brushing my teeth at all, whats more I was eating a lot of sweets, and my mother was spending a lot of money at a dentist. Everytime I had a lot of teeth to treat. At some point I was ashamed of my yellowish and bad teeth, I was scared I will not have teeth later in life. Dentists were saying if I will not care about it, I will have to wear denture. It scared me :P

Since I've started taking care of my teeth, brushing two times, flossing and using a water flosser my teeth improved a lot. Now of course I have to pay for my treatment, but luckily I dont have to go to a dentist so often. Usually 2-3 visits during a year. Last time I was 5 months ago, but still my teeth dont require any treatment.

There are plenty of other people/possibilities. Maybe you will find someone who is even better. Also remember, try to be emotionally attached to yourself the most. You will be spending most of your time with yourself, so try to love that person (you) the most. You will never be heartbroken again.
