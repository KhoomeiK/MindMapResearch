Beavers are a significant benefit to the ecosystem. Even if they weren't they can't be evil because they don't possess the cognition required for something to be evil. In this case the impact a beaver has is either positive or negative not evil or good.

>There is **no evidence that breed-specific laws make communities safer** for people or companion animals. Following a thorough study of human fatalities resulting from dog bites, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) decided to strongly oppose BSL. The CDC cited, among other problems, the **inaccuracy of dog bite data** and the **difficulty in identifying dog breeds** (especially true of mixed-breed dogs). Breed-specific laws are also **costly and difficult to enforce.**

And most importantly I'm absolutely *shocked* that someone like you would think correlational data proves causation. The research shows that when there is a fatal dog attack there are some very strong predictors but none of them is dog breed. They are things like abuse, neglect, being chained outside, and being unable to control their interactions with the child victim."

The context of your comment is an ignorant fool talking about rabies and millions of death in a snap. Globally rabies kills approximately 60,000 every year. For it to kill millions it would take 33.33 years which as you may or may not know is longer than 

>a snap

>""23 cases a year"" and thinks it's an absolute number and not a relative one.

23 is an absolute number. It isn't relative to anything. Are you daft? Unless you mean relative to your ridiculous number of millions of deaths in a snap.

Also let's not forget it's actually 1 or 2 cases a year not 23."
