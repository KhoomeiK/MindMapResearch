But that would make HIV and H1N1 pandemics, which are both more recent than 100 years, and H1N1 was only like 11 years ago as you said."

I've never actually been on a train in my life because passenger trains don't exist in my part of the world. There is no public transportation here of any sort, busses, trolleys, trains, etc.

In some big US cities there are, but most of us have to own our own cars and drive. If you choose to live outside of the city, you have to own a car, and there's not always an option for public transportation even if you do live in a city or town."

Astros,ffdovyc,t1_ffdmoj7,1579825491.0,"Get rid of the sport, or the dirty part?

It's weird. Besides the way the internet is acting, no baseball fans I know in person are surprised or really gives a shit about this or the steroids thing, Astros fans or not. Not saying that ""true"" baseball fans don't care, but it seems like this is a bigger deal to people that hang out on the internet, consuming this outrage culture shit.

Everyone knows baseball is dirty like you said. It's a psychological game in a lot of ways. It's not just ""hit ball, catch ball."" There's so much more to it, and sign stealing has always been a part of it. Fine them? Absolutely. The MLB made a rule against using electronics for sign stealing. But the sign stealing itself has long been a part of the game, and I feel like everyone is pretending it's never ever been a thing before this incident. That's not true, and it's weird that that's the part everyone is mad about as if they're oblivious to the last 50+ years of this game. They just got more elaborate with this than anyone could ever have imagined."

texas,ffcx2oz,t1_ffcqlpf,1579809067.0,"It's that FOX news outrage crowd whipped into a frenzy about a flood of Liberals coming from wicked ol' California, spreading the gay and turning the country into the big city. 

Same bullshit rhetoric that's been around forever. California is the anti-Texas, where people do what they want and have no appreciation for ""country"" folk like us who still live in the good ol' days. Texas Conservatives love to blame our problems on foreigners and Liberals from California, and Abbott and Texas Republicans play right into it because that's what their voters love to hear. Bashing the boogeyman that is California is all part of the circlejerk. Dan Patrick's last campaign commercial made it a point to say ""I won't let the liberals turn Texas into California.""

atheism,ffbe04a,t1_ffaxvsf,1579761284.0,"No, children can and do act independently of what their parents teach them regardless of how good or bad the parents may be. Children don't have the same tact that adults do, and some will resort to violence purely because they channel their emotions into action. A child acting this way probably has learned from *somewhere* that nonbelievers are bad people, but that could easily be something they learned in Sunday school from another child or adult. Children do repeat things their parents do, but they also are little individuals and act of their own accord. Some of the shittiest kids I know have the sweetest parents, and vice versa.

We can't say anything about the parents definitively from this discussion here on the internet as a removed third party. All we do know is that the little girl who assaulted OP's kid was hateful toward her because of her beliefs, and that's wrong regardless of where she learned it."

CruciblePlaybook,ffadnrm,t1_ffad13g,1579733107.0,"I just can't use it. I tried but I actually feel like my HHSN is less accurate? The recharge is nice, but yeah, inconsistent. HHSN is my ""oh shit"" maneuver when I've just melee'd and/or outgunned 3-4 people on a capture point and one more is coming to clean me up. It's a last ditch effort to save the point from being capped by the enemy and possibly make it out alive. Transversive plays into that strategy too by helping me get away. My play style just isn't compatible with using CH.

Me. 

Until like, last week I'd didn't even know or care much about CH. I honestly don't notice a difference personally when I run it, so it's not good enough for me to take off my Transversives however, I do know that some people run it for a really nasty build, getting their HHSN back in like 8 seconds and that's unfair, especially with the resistance buff and grenade energy return."

With Contraverse, it becomes basically your entire arsenal. HHSN itself isn't any more broken than shoulder charge or any other semi-risky OHK ability, but with the exotic and high discipline, it becomes a no-aim fusion rifle that grants increased damage resistance."
Fitness,ff9scr5,t1_ff9quro,1579720166.0,"That's where I'm at too. I'm 6ft and started at 290. Dropped down to 205, did some recomp and didn't diet for a while, got heavy and uncomfortable, dropped from 211 down to 191. My wife hated how skinny I was and wanted me thicker, but I've got no muscle to speak of, just skinny fat. She liked me when I was 250+ lol. I guess the difference is, I'll always see myself as too fat instead of too skinny. 

So I've been clean bulking and meeting my macro requirements, but eating a surplus after all this time still feels wrong, and it alters the way I see myself even though I probably look better than I ever have.

But hey! It's what a lot of us face. Believe me, you're not alone, and your feelings aren't because there is anything wrong with you. It's good you know that already. You probably set out on this journey because you weren't satisfied with the way you looked, and you're going to keep that mentality probably for a long time. Regardless, if you ever falter, try to trust what others tell you and if you haven't already, take plenty of progress pictures to remind you of your progress. That's all that's ever helped me to keep from feeling like I'm just wasting my time or not making progress."

Seeing that guy across the gym, and wishing you looked like that...until you realize it's you in the mirror and now you wonder why you look so fat today.
