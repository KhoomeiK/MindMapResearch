KipoAndTheAgeOfWB,ffajr6p,t3_ervxvc,1579737461.0,"You should definitely watch **Over the Garden Wall**. I believe it's on Hulu. It's a mini-series that you can easily finish in one cozy sitting. 

**Avatar: The Last Airbender** should be coming back to Netflix sometime this year, if somehow you haven't watched it yet. It's the granddaddy of this current wave of anime-inspired adventure cartoons. If you love that, then you may also like **The Dragon Prince** on Netflix. It’s not nearly as consistent, but there are still great moments in there. 

**Gravity Falls** is also excellent. It is very slow dealing out it's overarching plot, but it's very fulfilling when it comes together. Also hilarious. It is on Disney+, but it may still be on Netflix in some regions."

AskReddit,ff8pqb0,t1_ff8n0pq,1579690768.0,4 mg is actually still on the high end. Some people can work off just 0.5 mg. Melatonin isn’t a drug meant to overwhelm your brain and knock you out. It’s meant more as a “reminder” to your brain that it’s time to start winding down. Too much melatonin all at once will confuse your brain and possibly make it even harder to sleep.
AskReddit,ff8plrx,t1_ff8akbo,1579690588.0,"You should try a small dose, maybe even just 2 mg. That might actually work better.  Taking 10-20mg will actually make it harder to go to sleep.

beatsaber,fdnv1t6,t1_fdnu95z,1578593419.0,Ah. I guess cross-posting doesn’t show up on mobile or in third-party apps anymore. It used to show up on the mobile website (and I checked before I commented!) but it showed up as a self post there as well.
