The Blue Team had control for over *100 years* before the Red Team wrested it from them in 2010. That would make a group mighty tempted to use whatever measures they could to stay in power, imo.  

Now, if in those 100 years the Blue Team had championed non-partisan re-districting, I would be a lot more sympathetic to their loss of marketshare."
