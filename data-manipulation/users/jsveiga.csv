That would be an option (but requires that we take bagless trash bins from each toilet and from the kitchen sink to be emptied outside, and then washing/disinfecting the bins, Herby Curbys, etc to avoid the stink and vermin would create yet another environmental issue).

The trash collectors in my city in Brazil do not handle trash bins door to door. We do have a bunch of Herby Curbys at the gates of the gated community where a janitor concentrates the houses' wet/reclyclable trash.

Before that, the city garbage collectors would get in the gated community and collect door to door. I tried to use a big plastic bin for the recyclables, without a plastic bag, and one day it disappeared. I found it thrown half a block down the street. When I asked the collectors why did they do that, I got an angry ""WE DON'T DO BINS!"". And that was the return of the big plastic bag...

So at least where I live, we'd first have to push for changing that, before trying to abandon plastic trash bags. THEN push to stop supermarket plastic bags. Doing it first makes no difference, because as I mentioned in my first comment, if I don't get the bags for free with my groceries, I'll have to buy trash bags anyway.
