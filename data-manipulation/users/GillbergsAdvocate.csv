nba,fgok937,t3_eznugg,1580973175.0,Trade them for a late 1st
nba,fgok7i6,t1_fgog89f,1580973124.0,Draymond was an early second though
nba,fgok4u4,t3_ezo6vn,1580973036.0,Everything they did lead to drafting Derrick Rose. What they should've done differently is almost everything they did after drafting Derrick Rose
nba,fgok35i,t1_fgojwav,1580972980.0,But he was setting up teaming with Kyrie over the summer. He was gone before the season even started
nba,fgojzwe,t3_ezoj11,1580972873.0,Whichever one would costs less. You can't really go wrong with either if you have a competent front office
nba,fgojv3e,t1_fgojlle,1580972718.0,Same. 76ers bandwagon come playoffs
nba,fgoj6i8,t1_fgohh6n,1580971944.0,He's better than Jacob Evans that's for sure
nba,fgogspi,t1_fgofzdp,1580969430.0,He either only has a couple days left or the team has used them all. Which would explain why he hasn't been in the lineup in a while
nba,fgofv32,t1_fgofpf7,1580968526.0,He can he just won't. They'll keep him on a two-way because it doesn't effect the hard cap. That's why Chriss hasn't been signed to a full contract yet
wholesomememes,fgofg5p,t1_fgoef7h,1580968139.0,That doesn't sound like a Gabriel joke. You sure you're not thinking of Carlos Mencia?
nba,fgoerkc,t3_eznmja,1580967527.0,"Fuck man. Thanks Glenn, enjoy the playoffs"
wholesomememes,fgodzee,t1_fgmipxt,1580966833.0,But he is a good comedian..
wholesomememes,fgodxxm,t1_fgmzvh0,1580966797.0,Source?
wholesomememes,fgodxoz,t1_fgmjibg,1580966791.0,You're thinking of Carlos Mencia
nba,fgoavef,t1_fgo7mcr,1580964221.0,Yeah but maybe Philly still trades up
nba,fgoarai,t1_fgo9k1h,1580964131.0,Okay fine. An estimated 30 points. Happy?
nba,fgo5o4e,t1_fgo5erp,1580960384.0,Cap
nba,fgo5may,t1_fgo5k1v,1580960349.0,Sounds like Hornets
nba,fgo5i4k,t3_ezm5do,1580960268.0,"Fire Brett Brown


Always fire the coach before trading superstars that don't mesh on the floor"
nba,fgo56rs,t1_fgo254n,1580960051.0,But who says Hinkie would've wanted Fultz? You change who runs the team then you potentially change who gets drafted by said team
nba,fgo22v5,t1_fgo1uvv,1580957978.0,Most likely not. I have no faith in Brett Brown though
nba,fgo1vvi,t1_fgnzew8,1580957858.0,Because they have to have a few people who can actually play so it's not completely dumb
nba,fgo1scw,t1_fgnzcbf,1580957798.0,He can't play because of his knee
