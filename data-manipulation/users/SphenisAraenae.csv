Let's suppose you have a friend, you really like that friend, and that friend's physical appearance is ugly in your eyes, it should NOT matter that they're ugly if you're still good friends, but it doesn't negate the fact that they are indeed ugly.
So ugly people do exist, if not in your eyes in the eyes of others."
