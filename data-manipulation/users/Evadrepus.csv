mildlyinteresting,fepmtkb,t1_fepdsiy,1579324697.0,There's a building like this in Westlake Village that I've been to.  It's all pyramid shaped from the outside and one section looks like this.  They have filmed a bunch of movies in it because of its looks.  Outside is unique too - you can see it as the Police Department in Demolition Man.
shroudoftheavatar_raw,fenc7xc,t1_fena7iv,1579281573.0,"I know I've mentioned it before in this forum, but I was actually working on developing a Sci-Fi MMORPG at the time.  When AO came out, that was a completely untapped market. We had the megajuggernaught of EQ, UO was still a solid #2, and you had a few others who were trying to impact their market share like Asheron's Call.  

I'd spent weeks writing lore and background NPC dialog, working with a coder on how we would handle the triad (healer/tank/dps) in a sci-fi way, and we had just built our first landscape and town when one of heard about the AO beta.  It was so close to what we were developing that we basically just gave up.  I remember just stopping writing in shock and despair.  

AO had some really good ideas, but it took them a long time to really flesh them out.  Plus they were plagued by many many launch/post-launch issues and had a string of handling them poorly.  AO recovered to a point and is alive and profitable still, but nothing along what it could be.  

I guess SotA is trying to do that...but the difference here is there is a lack of bench skill to make the changes and generally a lack of willingness (or even ability it seems at time) to see those mistakes.  Criticism is viewed as trolling instead of the invaluable feedback it is.   If someone tells you, specifically, ""if you fix this, you can have my money"", it's a good idea to do so.  Putting new feature in because someone wants to give you money is good only when you have a strong foundation to build on.  Even Majoria admits that SotA is a massive string of at best half-built systems."

It was relatively soon after launch.  The game was plagued by a lot of minor but highly annoying bugs at launch and went from an EQ killer to another pretender because of it."

shroudoftheavatar_raw,fem42eb,t1_fekoo7y,1579239056.0,"> I like this question from Chris: ""UT in particular, one thing that comes to mind... why does an ice field effect floating liches?""

Because of spagetti code.  I can think of dozens of times this has happened in game development.  I can think of times *I* either caused or had it happen to me.

One of my favorites was the bug in AO a few weeks after release.  There was a small tuning change to how pistols worked.  Unfortunately, it caused NPCs (including ones you had to kill) to become IMMORTAL DPS GODS.  Took them a while to fix it because they dropped it on a Friday and went home and didn't monitor at all.  Cost a ton of subs by the time they got damage control on it."
