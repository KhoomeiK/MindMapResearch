Best buy were horrid, even with banking records showing the date and amount spent, plus the receipt they ""couldnt"" find the transaction in their system so wouldnt help me in getting the TV Fixxed. Called up Visio and their customer service verified i had completed a list of troubleshooting steps(simple things like turn it off and back on again style steps). Then they were going to schedule a repair tech to be out within 3 days to fix the tv(in home repair), while going through that process they realized that the model of TV i have is known to having power supply issues and they dont repair them because of this, so they shipped me a brand new tv, that was larger and a newer model than the one i had, at no cost, with in home setup included with the TV, i just had to be there with the old tv, they would pack up the old one and setup the new one, in and out of the house in less than 15 minutes."

Im so so sorry you had to go through that."
