ApplyingToCollege,ff88okq,t1_ff84pzj,1579669238.0,My father isn’t much help because he just goes along with whatever she does. I’m too scared to talk to adults because I don’t want them to take legal action because that scares me. I’m just holding on as best I can until I get to leave in a year
ApplyingToCollege,ff83ia5,t1_ff7uguv,1579665010.0,They don’t help at all. My school counselors are all kind of useless and end up making things worse :(
ApplyingToCollege,ff7rscy,t1_ff7rkia,1579656793.0,Thank you guys :(
ApplyingToCollege,ff78d78,t1_ff6tt48,1579643129.0,I’m too scared to talk to an adult. I honestly don’t know what’s holding me back but I’m just terrified
ApplyingToCollege,ff78b55,t1_ff6s9dg,1579643095.0,I’m still a junior so I got another year :(
ApplyingToCollege,ff789tk,t1_ff6yj5k,1579643073.0,No my mother actually abuses me and it’s not just for “discipline.” She will beat me up whenever she’s mad at me or doesn’t like when I’m winning an argument.
ApplyingToCollege,ff6ihhb,t1_ff6i089,1579627912.0,Oh damn I feel you dude. My mother is controlling and abusive and I can’t wait to leave her and not have to worry about going home and getting yelled at or beat up everyday. I’ve also been counting down the days lol
ApplyingToCollege,ff6ichx,t1_ff69fz4,1579627827.0,I relate to you man :(
percussion,ff6i71z,t1_ff64u5f,1579627738.0,Oh! We used bows for the vibes on the piece we played!! I was nervous at first but it sounded pretty good. The song we played was called “coming of age”
percussion,ff6i2b1,t1_ff53jk7,1579627656.0,My friend used semi hard rubber mallet for them and it sounded pretty good but I’m not sure what company they were. We experimented with hard and soft mallets and I personally liked the sound of the harder mallets but I guess it depends on the kind of sound you’re looking for :)
percussion,ff4rdy6,t3_ernd29,1579570613.0,Crotales! They’re an absolutely beautiful instrument that one of my buddies played for an ensemble with me :)

OCPoetry,fe22v95,t3_enmsop,1578833888.0,I liked the flow and the rhyming! I like how vague it was about missing this “her” so it feels like you want to remember her but you don’t at the same time.
drums,fe18mmm,t3_enjj83,1578823804.0,She’s gorgeous!
poetry_critics,fe05vrl,t1_fe042qp,1578803826.0,Thank you so much for the feedback! I was worried it sounded a little edgy but I will work on fixing that :)

SuicideWatch,fdqfwcg,t1_fdnp6iu,1578665643.0,People don’t like positivity I guess :(
SuicideWatch,fdqfuvd,t1_fdnl9qu,1578665614.0,"My philosophy is: “life is an asshole that punches you in the face but you gotta be a bigger asshole and punch life in the face.” It sounds dumb, but whenever I feel upset and I feel like I just want to die I think about this dumb thing I made up and it cheers me up a bit."
SuicideWatch,fdmg7zc,t3_em54sj,1578548846.0,"Dude I feel you. I’m an also Indian and my parents(mostly my mother) constantly compare to other people and are never satisfied with anything I do.  What’s worse is I’m gay but I haven’t told them yet and I know they’re not going to want me anymore once they find out. Hang in there dude, I have around 500 days until I graduate and leave my parents and I’m hanging on because I know things will get better soon. Feel free to pm me if you need to vent or need a friend who understands what you’re going through."
SuicideWatch,fdmf00o,t3_em36ps,1578547719.0,Please talk to me. I may be a stranger on the internet but I care about you. I’ve been there too bud and I’m not gonna say life gets better but just hold on.
SuicideWatch,fdme1x7,t3_em4kdu,1578546875.0,"Your daughters love you. Please don’t die. You are not obligated to live for other people but please live for yourself at least. I don’t know if this helps in anyway, I’m sorry."
offmychest,fdlzqr9,t3_elxt3x,1578536383.0,"This is possibly off topic a bit but I travel to India a lot because I have family there and let me tell you, indian guys are disgusting when it comes to women. I’m so uncomfortable going outside because guys are staring at me up and down and saying things like “hey come over here, sister”(rough translation of my language I’m sorry). Seeing groups of guys makes me especially nervous because I’m powerless if they decide to jump me. When my cousins also come to india, I dress up like a guy when we all go out(I’m tall for an Indian girl so it’s kind of believable) to attempt to protect them. The youngest girl cousin I have is around 9 or 10 but guys would look at her disgustingly too. I know all men aren’t bad, but I’m wary of every guy in India because I don’t want to end up on the news for getting raped and murdered. I hear so many stories of assault but no one here does anything about it. Thankfully me and my cousins have never been attacked or approached before but I’m still always scared."
OCPoetry,fdjve2o,t3_eljids,1578488761.0,"I love how each set of lines has a distinct atmosphere to it. The first is like a warm summer day when you’re sitting with a friend or someone close and just vibing. The second is like a place you want to be, on the edge of a calm body of water surrounded by nature. The third one feels like a constant battle with someone you love and how that’s encapsulated between the days and the nights of your time together. Idk those are my thoughts but I really enjoyed these little lines :)"

My mom may do horrible things to me but she also has poor mental health. She was very depressed after I was born and she never got better. She tried to kill herself this past Christmas and ever since then I feel like itâ€™s my fault that she tried. I called her out for hurting me and even almost got the police involved and I think it hurt her that I would do that. I donâ€™t know how to deal with her anymore, if I retaliate it ends poorly for her but if I do nothing it ends poorly for me."
