Music,ffd6n2r,t1_ffd4805,1579814446.0,"They are completely nuts and I've heard a few stories of them doing this type of stuff in the Clearwater area. In 
 [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dlk00e/im_a_florida_reporter_who_covers_scientology_i/) about Scientology buying up property to control a lot of the downtown area, [another resident discusses](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dlk00e/im_a_florida_reporter_who_covers_scientology_i/f4r44o9/) how they harassed him at his home.

My brother didn't have a gun at the time, but does now. He recently told me he doesn't think he would have needed to fire it, but he definitely would have brandished it at them and made his intentions clear."
Music,ffcps93,t1_ffcjyml,1579804643.0,"They didn't run away enmasse - it was more like bro would chase one, swinging and screaming, then run at another one. Then they were like ""ok, we'll leave"". 

I have read somewhere here on reddit that Scientologists will back off when people are flipping out, screaming, chasing etc... especially if they're being videoed (but I could be wrong). Not to say they'll always stay away, but I think they don't want to be seen in a negative light. This happened about 15 years ago, before the age of filming & posting stuff like this. Man, I wish there was video!"
Music,ffcd99q,t1_ffaovrs,1579796956.0,"They harass a lot of people - I've posted this story before, but I'll copy it here...

My brother and sister-in-law live in Clearwater, FL (where Scientology has a huge headquarters and they basically rule the city). They own a house now, but used to rent a different one. Landlord said the house was vacant because the previous tenant was a young woman who joined Scientology and gave them all her money. Then she changed her mind and basically ran away in the middle of the night.

The Scientology a-holes were looking for her and harassed my bro & SIL for a while. It started with phone calls, then visits. They would try to threaten my bro, saying, ""You'll regret it if you're hiding her. Tell us where she is!"" Each time they would say they just rent the house, they don't know her, don't know where she went or how to get in touch with her. 

Then one day about 20 of them came & surrounded the house. They had bats & hockey sticks and started banging on the house and chanting ""Send (bang) her (bang) out (bang)!"" They did it over and over and over.

My brother's dog flipped out and hurt herself trying to jump out the window. My bro grabbed his own baseball bat, ran out and chased them screaming that he was going to kill them. Apparently that convinced them and they never came back.

Bro did call the cops, but it was an unincorporated section of Clearwater. The county sheriff’s office handled calls instead of local police and they took forever to get there.

Tl;Dr - Scientologists harassed my brother about the renter before him who ran away from the cult"
