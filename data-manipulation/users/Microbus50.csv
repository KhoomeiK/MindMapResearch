nevertellmetheodds,fgl1pb9,t3_eyp8xf,1580879294.0,I think #14 forgot what team he's on.
beetle,fgd7pxn,t3_ext43b,1580679707.0,Is this a 70s model? I believe that was a diagnostic port dealer had a special machine setting dwell and timing. I never saw the machine as they got rid of it by the time I worked at a dealer in the 80s. I remember these plugs. Was this fuel injected as well?
Eyebleach,fg4qlbb,t3_ewn3zf,1580508922.0,My cat would never let anyone hold him like that. Not even me. The only person he likes. My cats just a feral a-hole. Even raised him from a week old found in the alley. No respect. I'd love a real cat like this.

depressionregimens,fg0xnnh,t1_fg0u9w9,1580417050.0,Ive considered psilocybin and possibly growing my own. Dosage would be my concern. In my teens and 20s we would jam down a gram or so each and trip for a few hours. That was totally recreational. Microdosing would be a little different. I need more research on that. Thanks btw.
Roku,fg0wiw4,t1_fg0hzqk,1580416410.0,"That's good to know. However I have an Ultra, Premiere, a 3 and a 2. I'm in the market for a new, maybe 32 inch tv. Does not need to be 4k. I dont want my limited data used up. I can live with 1080p. Any suggestions?"
Roku,ffzso7m,t1_ffzozxy,1580391765.0,I think there is a belief out there that the apps on the televisions wont update as frequently as tech progresses. Having the latest greatest like an Ultra may make people think they are getting the latest app options and upgradability. Just my thought. I have a 10 year old non Roku Smart LG and the only app that works on it is Vudu. Surprised that even works. Used to be updated all the time untill about 6 years ago. Now nothing. Its a nice TV with no apps upgradeable. Not even Netflix or YouTube work on it. External Roku makes it all good again.
askcarsales,ffzrt87,t3_ev4n7q,1580391048.0,"Worked for Audi for 15 years as that field tech you described. You bitch hard enough to corporate, they'll give. Post on all social media pictures and they all see it. They have departments looking for bad press. Keep calling customer service. Ask for their boss. Yeah be a Karen. It will get their attention. Ive dealt with maybe a hundred cases trickled down from my bosses bosses to inspect and find a resolution. Some times leading to buyback. If you did not do the damage, someone will be forced to pay for a solution. I probably don't expect Audi level service here but bad press is damaging and manufacturers know it."
