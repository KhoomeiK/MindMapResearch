learntodraw,fg0u31y,t1_fg0ss77,1580415040.0,"Just an idea, maybe have the tail sitting on the same plane as the cat's feet, so it looks like it is sitting on the floor instead of hanging down, and use perspective to make the center of the loop a bit larger. That would give a bit more room for the paw print.

Also, make sure the paw print follows the curve of the tail. It should wrap around the circumference of the tail if it's large enough, making some of the paw print just out of view."
learntodraw,fg09llo,t1_ffzdqpq,1580403160.0,"I love the idea and the body shape and head look great! If you're going for realism, the tail looks a bit too long in my opinion. It sounds like you are trying to make that the focus of the piece with the paw print, so a bit of exaggeration on the length of the tail could be an artistic choice. 

Still, I suggest Googling cat anatomy diagrams for reference. In most cases, the tail is roughly the length of the spine, from shoulders to the base of the tail. This can vary, of course, but the tail should be close to that if you're going for realism. You can still bring the eye to the tail with color or even by adding perspective to make the tail appear closer to the viewer than the cat's body. Just some ideas, but great execution overall!"

gameideas,fe5o7qv,t3_enscvq,1578872024.0,"It depends on the mood and feel you're wanting in the game. It sounds like you might be planning some kind of 4th wall break where the characters eventually seek adventure beyond the game itself. If that's the case, I imagine you could frame it in a number of different ways depending on what role you want this area beyond the wall to play in the story.

If you're looking for something that sounds brooding and ominous, it would be called something different than just something unknown. For example, the deepest parts of the ocean are still pretty unknown and unexplored, which could be terrifying if done right (see games like Subnautica or Dead Spacefor inspiration). It could be something that produces imagery of a cold, chilling, heavy darkness with muted sounds and lurking shadows. I think of words like, ""The Expanse,"" or ""The Depths,"" ""The Vacuum,"" or ""The Fog.""

For a more mysterious feeling of something beyond the borders of the game that beckons the MC to venture out far beyond their home, I think of games that kind of call you to explore them, like any of the Zelda games, Outward, Fable, and movies like The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and countless others. I think of names like ""The Unknown,"" ""The Great Beyond,"" or ""The Divide.""

Good luck with your game! This sounds like a really interesting game mechanic and I hope it can become something great!"

unpopularopinion,fdo212d,t1_fdo1lum,1578597444.0,"Thinking back to shows I liked that had a live audience, ""The IT Crowd"" comes to mind. So, I guess there are some shows that somehow do it right, but it's a fine line between good comedy with an audience reaction that seems appropriate and canned laughter."
unpopularopinion,fdo16be,t1_fdo0zcx,1578596987.0,I'm glad I'm not the only one that feels this way. I'll never understand why people love shows like this. I wonder if they like the shows in spite of the audience reaction or because of it.
unpopularopinion,fdo0xz9,t1_fdo0oss,1578596858.0,"I think I have a pretty good sense of humor. I laugh all the time at things I think are actually funny. I realize humor is subjective and plenty of people find these shows very funny and entertaining. I just never could get into a show with a laugh track and I can't imagine I'm alone here.

Think of it this way, if you were standing in a group having a conversation with several people and someone cracks a joke that is funny enough to warrant laughter from everyone, but one person is laughing hysterically, to the point that it doesn't seem genuine, wouldn't that take the focus off of the person telling the joke and put it on the person laughing at it? This is how I feel audience reactions ruin good comedy. It becomes distracting at a certain point, especially if it doesn't feel genuine."
unpopularopinion,fdo0dpu,t1_fdo04jx,1578596522.0,"That's fascinating. So, the recording of the audience's reaction was played live or it was added in post (not sure if this was recorded for airing later or an actual live broadcast)?"
unpopularopinion,fdnzvbr,t1_fdnz7th,1578596225.0,"Was the audience prompted when to laugh like with a sign or something? Or was it just a heightened expectation that they would find it really funny? For example, if you've ever been to a live comedy show and thought someone was really funny and then saw them later and it just wasn't the same... There's something about seeing it live that makes it funnier and easier to laugh along. But shows that are aired on TV and meant to be consumed in your living room don't have that same ether, so it's inherently not going to seem as funny to the viewer as it is to the live audience. This kills it for me and it seems like that would hurt the ratings, and yet they are still so popular. I don't get it."
AskReddit,fdnzec2,t1_fdnz3t8,1578595949.0,"My thoughts exactly! If it isn't funny enough to elicit a laugh from me at home, why is everyone in the audience losing their shit over a line that's only kind of funny? That disconnect is exactly what ruins it for me. Either it isn't that funny or I'm just not as easily entertained, and I like to think I have a pretty decent sense of humor. So, it's probably just bad writing and scripted audience reactions."

AskReddit,fdnz16e,t1_fdnyikp,1578595737.0,"That's my thought, too. It's like they couldn't come up with anything really funny so they had to add a live audience to hide that fact. Every time I hear it, I can't help but imagine a giant neon ""LAUGH"" sign flashing in front of the audience."
AskReddit,fdnyv5t,t1_fdnynqv,1578595640.0,"Exactly! Which is why I can't stand it, because it feels like forced laughter, like when your boss tells a joke that really isn't that funny but everyone awkwardly loses their shit, anyway."
AskReddit,fdnxm7l,t3_emdthr,1578594914.0,"I mentioned to a friend recently that I didn't care for the typical sitcoms and shows that included audience reactions because they almost always sound scripted when the audience is laughing hysterically for something that is objectively not that funny. He of course loves shows like The Big Bang Theory, Friends and others like this and disagreed wholeheartedly with my statement. I'm not saying I don't think these shows are funny, just that the canned laughter kind of ruins the experience for me, and yet these kinds of shows constantly hit the biggest TV ratings and are featured prominently in commercials, online ads and frequently air during prime time slots. 

For contrast, comedy shows like The Office or Brooklyn 99 are examples of great comedies that I found highly funny and entertaining and yet they didn't require any kind of audience reaction and I find them way more appealing. Am I in the minority here?"

findareddit,fdnlqxf,t1_fdnavct,1578588441.0,"Second the crate training idea. We have two dogs we raised from pups and had the same issues with late night messes while we were sleeping. We decided to try crate training and it has made life so much better for them and us. We bought an extra large crate so they could sleep together which helped them feel safer than if we had bought two small crates. It took a week or so for them to get used to crating at night but now they prefer it and will nap in there on their own throughout the day. We leave the door open all day and only close it at night when we are heading to bed.

If you decide to give this a try, prepare for your dog to whine and yelp through the night for a few days. Don't yell at it or tell it to be quiet or give any negative attention. It's best to just completely ignore the crying if you can, or just give it some reassuring love. If they have a comfort toy, you can put it in their crate at night and that can help some with the adjustment. Every dog is different so it might take longer or they might adjust almost immediately. Just be consistent and stick it out and don't give up and it will pay off. Good luck!"
