DestinyTheGame,fc2vfnp,t3_eftura,1577375103.0,"Pretty much echoes how I feel too. Been here since day one but Dawn is the first expansion/season I havent bought because I don't enjoy playing the game anymore. I was a raiding fiend back in the day, I even kept doing VoG up until they remastered it for season of triumph and kept running it till D2. I probably have way too much nostalgia but I can't help it. I started playing Warframe again a month ago after not playing it since I started Destiny and it's been great, recently hit 1000 hours on PC. I don't regret any of the money or time I have put into Destiny because I know it will help it become a better game, and I hope the future kinderguardians fall in love with it like I did."
YouShouldKnow,fbqaah9,t3_edytkr,1577029804.0,"I've had a pretty hard to notice underbite my whole life (family didn't even know till a few years ago) which has never bothered me much. It has never caused me any problems but has made me think that normal teeth rest together when they're not being used. This is really great to know, I want to take care of my teeth as much as I can!"
