politics,fdmchth,t3_em3vjg,1578545542.0,"Here's the angle:

Obama was caught between a rock and a hard place. He didn't want to further advance violence against other countries, but found himself apon new technologies that could bomb without endangering others (drones).

The public sentiment AT THE TIME was still that we needed to fight terrorism, and drone attacks seemed like a great idea.

Thank you Patriot Act I and II for making that possible.

So to attack Obama personally for doing this, while facing pressure from a REPUBLICAN CONGRESS to act .. for him to not proceed with drone attacks would have made him appear completely ineffectual.

That's the long story short. Capiche?"
