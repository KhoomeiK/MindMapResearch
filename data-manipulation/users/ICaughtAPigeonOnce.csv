Whatcouldgowrong,ff8deh8,t3_es29w1,1579673855.0,"didn't some boat tour companies in Thailand have a problem with Chinese tourists drowning? like because they would unexpectedly jump into the water without knowing how to swim?

I'm genuinely perplexed by how people manage to have such little foresight. I live in a city that happens to be a tourism destination, and for some reason it's always the Chinese tourists that wreck havoc with their lack of basic reasoning skills. I'm really not trying to be racist - genuinely want to know what it is in their culture or society that doesnt prepare them for.... idk, everything.

ps. as an example I once saw a guy trying to take a selfie walk backwards into heavy traffic, a random person ran out and grabbed him but he seemed confused as to why they were forcing him back onto the sidewalk.

Also one time I was restocking liqour (I bartend) and there was a lady looking for the bathroom in our tiny, packed, 5ft x 5ft storage area. She was pulling on a shelf with HUNDREDS of bottles of liqour as well as cases of champagne and stuff on it to see if maybe the bathroom was behind it I guess. This metal shelving unit is clearly immobile, and you can see the wall behind it too. if I hadnt come back there she could have pulled the thing down on herself and been seriously injured. i dont even know how she got back there, she must have snuck in behind me while i had my back turned for a second and gone all the way around behind the bar lol.

Like i said, I dont't dislike them, I actually usually find people who do silly/dumb things fun and entertaining. I'm not easily angered or resentful. I'm just curious."

oddlysatisfying,fej9elc,t1_fdg6l9y,1579162657.0,"true, but I mean is it even really a risk if the chances of a mistake are the same regardless of the orientation of the log? I feel like his handling of the log and axe suggest that this is one of those situations. 

I've worked in jobs that involved doing relatively dangerous tasks and sometimes people would comment on it, like we're taking risks - but honestly the chances of us hurting ourselves were less than the chances someone trips while crossing a street and hurts themselves doing an every day task. I never saw a single person hurt depsite the technical challenges of some of the tasks.

basically I'm just asking, at a certain point could the chances of error be so negligible that you just dont even consider it a risk?"
