uAlberta,ffj6jqj,t3_etv2ad,1579991658.0,"My mom died not much after I started uni and I still haven’t really “recovered” and it’s been almost 5 years. I’ve had better times than others and I definitely am in a better place than I was for the first couple years. But my grades definitely took a turn for the worst. I also never reached out to anyone and that’s on me, that’s my own fault. I didn’t tell any of my professors or anything because I honestly never really thought to. I was dumb enough to have the mindset of “who would care?” Well that’s not the reality, your profs are human too and they will care. 

Everyone deals with death differently though, and even if your grades *do* take a dip, don’t be so hard on yourself. All you can do is try your best. You’ve already gotten some great advice in this thread and I don’t have much to add, just wanted to add my experience and that you aren’t alone in that. My condolences go out to you, and please take care of yourself. I’m not saying to not worry about your grades at all, but your mental health comes first."
vegan,ffi2wjq,t1_ffhuxty,1579963506.0,"I’ve mentioned this on this sub before but your comment reminds me so much of the debate my dad and I were having about veganism. He fully supports that I’m vegan and he agrees about the environmental impact of animal products even, but when talking about the moral aspects of it... man he’s stubborn. So stuck on “humane” meat and no amount of explaining that it still isn’t right didn’t convince him otherwise."
bulletjournal,fffolva,t3_et8iow,1579888429.0,Every time I see black bujo spreads it makes me miss my black one I used last year. This looks really great! I love that doing very simple designs can look so elevated with the black paper.
muacirclejerk,fffjif1,t1_ffev17n,1579885306.0,"This is definitely my roommate. She got into makeup years after I did and very very quickly had WAY more makeup than I did, and I’m not a minimalist as far as my makeup collection goes. And it’s sad because she will just throw out a bunch of makeup that is less than a year old and buys hundreds and hundreds of dollars more, and then throws out makeup, buys more and repeat. And she will complain about being overwhelmed with her collection, and complain about being poor. It’s just sad to see because its definitely compulsive shopping and/or a shopping addiction"
NintendoSwitch,ffd9jny,t1_ffczkf8,1579816088.0,"Do you use a controller on the iPad? I tried playing it on the iPad and I was running into problems, but for the life of my I can’t remember what they were. It had to do with the controls though, I think I wasn’t able to complete certain actions or something."
bulletjournal,ffb18vz,t1_ffauyo4,1579749284.0,"Me too. I go through phases where I won’t touch the game for months, then I’ll pick it back up and I can’t put it down. It’s so easy to get carried away too because “oh I’ll just do one more day, then I’ll stop” and then “well I have a bunch of crops that will be ready to harvest so I’ll just do that and then I will stop” and it’s an endless cycle lol.

You’re referring to the gelly roll pens I assume? I love those! I had a blackout book last year and used those a bunch, they look so amazing on dark paper. I’m using a normal white paged bujo now but I want to incorporate more bits of black here and there so I have an excuse to use those pens more."
bulletjournal,ffasd3a,t3_esfywo,1579743368.0,That looks so nice! I have mine just sloppily swatched and in no particular order. This makes me want to redo my swatches page because this looks so much better
bulletjournal,ffaru4l,t3_esitdu,1579743013.0,"I see a fellow Stardew Valley fan! Isn’t that game the best?! 

Also lovely spread! I like the bold black background for each day’s of the week, I’m going to have to try that in a future spread. It’s simple but has such a nice effect."
ipad,ff66vna,t3_eru7vw,1579620554.0,"I haven’t read through all the comments so perhaps this was said already, but it could be clothing. If I’m wearing a long sleeve shirt and the sleeve is on my wrist, it’s inevitably touching the iPad when I write and it sometimes causes the pencil to stutter just like yours."
bulletjournal,fevzll9,t3_eql2dv,1579403481.0,Oh wow that’s gorgeous! I want to do a Studio Ghibli theme in my bujo at some point this year. I’m saving your post as inspo.
bulletjournal,fdirrvc,t1_fdik8ah,1578449588.0,"Just an FYI, I had a black bujo last year and I think it was that white pen you are using (I tried out a few white pens so it could have been a different one) and it transferred over onto the other page. I would just hate to see all your hard work get ruined, so if your worried about it I suggest throwing a piece of tissue or something on the page so the two pages don’t touch when the book is closed"
StardewValley,fbf1yrp,t1_fbetrl1,1576799484.0,"I do now! I didn’t have it when I went to the caves for the first time. I completely overlooked that fact too, yeah that will make loads easier."
