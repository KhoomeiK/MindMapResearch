Most people are wed where they live (or traditionally, where the parents of the bride live), and the ""publication des bans"" (the official publication at least 10 days before the wedding) is a cultural remnant of a time where the head of family (father, and before that eldest male in direct line) had a little more power (legal or otherwise) in a society where the nuclear family was not the norm (i.e. until the 60s... )."

Regarding the degree of relationship, you can't marry a parent, grandparent (...), a sibling or half sibling, an aunt or uncle (also true if these relations are through complete adoption, but not true for siblings and aunts/uncles in case of simple adoption), a step-parent or a step-child (except if the parent or child by blood is deceased, but you'll need a complex legal procedure I believe, and the bets are off if it was a civil union and not a marriage).

worldnews,fcx6279,t1_fcwzpfz,1578052734.0,"That's a fair question: outside of terrorism, Iran does not have the capacity to attack the US territory.  
They could strenghthen their supports to groups through the middle east to attack US allies and military bases and oil fields, keep going at encircling SA, mine the gulf to interdict trade. Going from a cold war state to a full on proxy war and direct attacks would have major effects on Israel, SA, EAU, Qatar, maybe Afghanistan and Pakistan, Koweit, Iraq, Syria, maybe Jordan, and a new influx of refugees could be destabilizing European countries. A petrol price hike would have less direct effects on the US than in the past, but if it cause a recession in Europe, it would impact the whole world.  
While Iran does not have the capacity to ""win"" a war against the US and their allies, they are much stronger than Iraq or Afghanistan were."

france,fcksd9v,t1_fckq3ac,1577732152.0,"Une autre explication: tu fait un footing, ta position change; tu pourrais tracer un beau graphique avec la distance que tu as parcouru depuis le départ en ordonnée (vertical) et le temps en abscisse (horizontal). La pente de cette courbe, le changement de position en fonction du temps, c'est la dérivée temporelle, donc la vitesse (en kilomètre par heure); l'accélération c'est le changement de vitesse en fonction du temps (mètres par seconde par seconde), et ainsi de suite.  
Dans l'autre sens, si tu as une courbe de ta vitesse pendant ton footing, le processus d'intégration (d'une certaine manière, l'inverse de la dérivée), qu'on décrit souvent comme ""la surface sous la courbe"", te permet de calculer la distance que tu as parcouru. Si tu dérives par rapport au temps les 10 km que tu as parcouru en une heure, tu obtiens une vitesse de 10km/h; et si tu intègres ces 10km/h sur une période d'une heure, tu obtiens la distance parcourue (10km).  
Ce sont des outils que l'on utilise un peu de manière automatique, sans forcément comprendre les objets mathématiques qu'il y a derrière : si je me prend un mur en voiture, ma vitesse change très vite (voire instantanément, l'accélération est très forte, et negative), et c'est pas une bonne nouvelle; et y'a pas besoin d'avoir fait un DEUG de math pour le savoir, mais le savoir aide lors dudit DEUG de math."
