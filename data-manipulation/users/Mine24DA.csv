Is it ethical for a tattoo artist to tattoo a drunk person ? Is ethical to sell something to an old lady with dementia ? No it is not. 

All of these are also illegal because these people could not consent , as they were not of sound mind. We have professionals to determine this. It is literally their job . 

I am pro assisted suicide in terminal illnesses. Because these people are of sound mind. It is a logical decision. But for depression the wish to die is part of the illness. Therefore it would go against the medical profession to assist with the suicide instead of treating the illness. It would be against a medical standard. A terminal ill patient will die regardless, but a suicide will lessen their suffering. A depressed person doesn't have to die. Killing him cannot be a treatment, as it doesn't help him. So how can it be legal for the doctor to do so? I certainly think that relatives would sue and win, as the patient wasn't of sound mind , and the law can't change that. So making it legal is not possible."
changemyview,fglc6g3,t1_fgjvtte,1580890345.0,"I think that would be being a medical professional. They are educated and get paid for evaluating the patient. A physician assisted suicide would therefore only work for physical chronic illnesses, as everyone else could not consent. 

Perhaps a different procedure that we could discuss : people with body dysmorphia sometimes feel like a limb is not part of them. They want surgeons to take off that arm or leg. A surgeon would never do that because it is a mental illness and therefore the patient cannot consent to a procedure that is not necessary. Some of these patients cut their arms off themselves at one point if it gets too bad. 

Do you also think that the surgeon should cut off their arm, because some of them will do it at home otherwise? If not why is it different?"

You say the western media is biased against the turkish because they are Muslim. I say the turkish are delusional. I was actually able to talk to a nationalist and turkey and make him admit that Atatürk did bad things as well and should be worshipped like he is. I did that in a restaurant, and it was actually dangerous to do. When people start talking about politics and don't agree with the mainstream nationalist opinion , people get hushed, so that no fight is starting. You say nobody cares about other countries but that's not true. Its 2020. The USA has to deal with their history if slaves and killing the native Americans. Great Britain has to deal with it colonial times. Germany accepts the holocaust, and teaches it etc. Just because other countries are bad doesn't mean turkey doesn't have to accept their history as well. Turkey also gets a lot of criticism  because they developed backwards in the last couple of years, and all the university students I talked to agreed on that one. They were secular moved backwards , financially prospering, moved backwards , had great connections to the west moved backwards. Erdogan has a lot of political similarities  to Hitler.

First of all, having children with him would be selfish and irresponsible without IVF, and it doesn't sound like you can afford that. Just because he has a mild case doesn't mean, that your children would have a mild case. And planning a child with a 50 percent chance of being disabled, where you don't know how severe it would be is just selfish in my opinion. 

Second point you have low self esteem, it sounds like you don't think you deserve love, and love your boyfriend because he is good to you and loves you despite all this. This is not a good base for a relationship. You should be happy and healthy on your own without relying for that on someone else. If you are not happy with your appearance change it. If you are overweight lose weight , it would be healthier any way. Your relationship started at an age where you were quite vulnerable, and it sounds like you use him like an emotional crutch, which is also unfair to him. 

Your boyfriend might be wonderful, I don't know. But you should be realistic. Your mum has a point saying to not have children. If you talk to a doctor about family planning they will say something similar. It is not fair to the unborn child to risk a disability, simply because you want children together.
