I’m only familiar with the job interviews rather than school things, but there’ll be some overlap:

“What do you know about us/what we do?” 

For this you’ll want to know roughly three facts, including the obvious what the company does. So like “You were founded in [year], by [person]. You do [thing]. And you hold [whatever] as an important value for the company to uphold.”

“Why do you want to work here?”

This is where you get to be really excited about the product/company/research, etc. 

“Do you have any questions?”

Coming up with some in advance helps, but you can also ask any that have come to mind while you’re talking. (Write them down if you want to, but if you’re going to take notes use a notebook, not a scruffy scrap of paper.) There are some really good ones here >> https://www.thecut.com/article/questions-to-ask-in-a-job-interview.html

The dreaded “What’s your biggest weakness?”

Do NOT say “I’m a perfectionist.” Not even if it’s true. It’s been done so much it looks twisty and dishonest. Pick an actual weakness that you have, and talk about what steps you’re taking to overcome it. (I mention my shyness/fear of public speaking, but tell them that I’m working to overcome it by having mental scripts and by practicing in less formal situations, for an example.)

“What are your strengths?” 

Answer honestly and back up your answer with an example.

Sometimes they’ll ask about your hobbies too. Mention a skill that you’re trying to learn, a creative hobby, or something social that you do. Basically you want to suggest that you like to grow as a person and learn new things. (Although watching movies and such is a fine answer too. The only one to really avoid is if you go clubbing a lot; they might worry that you’ll call in sick or come to work hungover.)


One that isn’t so relevant now, but important for the future: If an interviewer ever asks why you’re leaving your current job. DOOOON’T slag off your boss. (Or the company, or your co-workers!) Even if they’re the most genuinely awful boss ever. It does not make you look mature and professional. Talk about the positive changes the new role will bring, (new skills, new environment, etc.)"

NoStupidQuestions,ff6uk7z,t1_ff6tcbj,1579635179.0,"Honestly, a good interviewer isn’t trying to catch you out, they’re just trying to make sure you know what you’re taking about and that you’ll fit in with their existing people. So don’t be too stiff either, let them get a sense of your personality.

And remember that you’re interviewing them too. Definitely take control of the conversation a bit, for example, asking about what kind of things you might do in a day, or problems you might encounter. (Bonus of you’re able to say “Oh! I would fix that by doing [x].”

And one tip for your mental health: Even if it doesn’t go entirely to plan, you just got some practice at doing interviews. (I’ve had a LOT of practice, lol.)

There’s a whole bunch of tips and such about interviews here, take a look if it’ll help. >> https://www.askamanager.org/category/interviewing"
NoStupidQuestions,ff6t6l1,t3_erz9zb,1579634371.0,"A lot of this applies to jobs but it should work for this too.

Pre-interview:

Look up the kind of questions you’re likely to be asked and practice answering them, get a friend to help if you can.

Make sure you can recite some facts about thing you’re interviewing for. Especially know what they do that makes you so excited to do it.

Interview:

Smile at, and shake hands with everyone you meet. Be extremely polite including to the receptionist/secretary. If you can’t cope with eye contact, looking at peoples mouths or the top of their nose is usually close enough to fool them.
 
If you’re feeling nervous, look out a window for a bit and BREATHE. It’s ok to take time to think about a question, and you can definitely ask to come back to a tough one. Don’t fold your arms, and don’t look at your shoes. You can hide a certain amount of nervous energy by clenching your toes up inside your shoes.

Thank the interviewer(s) for their time before you leave; tell them it was nice to meet them. (I’m told that I’m America you also send a written thank you when you get home too. Weird.)

I hope some of that helps, good luck!"
