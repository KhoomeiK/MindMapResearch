But I just want to let something out which I think needs to be heard. In today's age too many people follow the us against them mentality. Most people don't even try to understand what the other party has to say because the fact that they oppose you is enough to shut them out. This leads to people living their whole life in their own bubbles of reality. I don't care about lesbians gays or bi people. I certainly think they should just be allowed to be who they are because why should you care? They don't make anyones life worse. If you can't handle a gay hitting on you, that's ridiculous. But the sentiment of hating anti lgbtq people just worsens the problem. People need to see that everyones just human. Not so different from yourself. They may be different but oh my God would it be boring on Earth if everyone was the same. Just enjoy your life, surround yourself with positive people and don't put people down. If you are the kind of person to be against another person because of whatever believe they hold, good or bad, you are part of the problem. Try to understand. Try to communicate. If you can't understand someone and their way of life, don't make them feel bad about it. Accept that they are different and move on doing your thing. You, and in general all of us are not that important. Most humans have this huge Ego Problem that they think they themselves are way more important than they are. Just relax, see, hear, smell, touch and experience this world. 

Anti-LGBTQ are not bad. LGBTQ people are not bad. 
Some of them are. But both sides are shitty. But also. Both sides can be wonderful people. 

Try to understand people. Don't judge before you ask."

Tram has only been late if there is a dude parking his car on the rails which happens more often than you'd expect but still on time most of the time.

On the one hand it made me realize many things that are wrong with me and society but on the other hand it crippled me mentally and I often have trouble believing what I see. I just don't believe it's real sometimes.

Psychedelics are a two sided coin.

Imo the big mistake I made was that I took them too young. I should have waited until im 25 or something. And that's also what is suggest to everybody. Try shrooms or acid once in your life. Don't worry, it's not addictive (well maybe a little but everything can be addictive depending on the user). You WILL learn something. And even if the trip is bad, you'll be glad after. Start with a okay dosage (100ug for acid).

If a proper trip is not your thing I suggest microdosing for a week or month. 

But I strongly suggest you try it. You'll be nicer to others and yourself after. You'll understand yourself better. 
You'll be more creative. You'll be happier.

(Everybody is different. It is certainly possible that nothing I described is fitting with you but in my opinion that's your fault and not the drugs. Your state of mind decides the outcome.)
