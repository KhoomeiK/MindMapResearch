loseit,ffgfgl0,t1_fffozz6,1579905045.0,Thank you! I try to not let it affect me but our conversations have become shorter because they always end up involving weight loss at some point.
loseit,fff5s5e,t1_fff2sh9,1579876427.0,"My mum tries to keep it to herself but she can't help but let slip how much she preferred me in ""teddy bear"" size. I'm 180 lbs now (down from 300) and the last positive comment she made about my weight loss was around 220."
socialanxiety,ff685hk,t1_ff4oxbp,1579621397.0,"> Fortunately SA gives me a great poker face.

This is one of the few real benefits of my SA. I've been in plenty of situations where people around me panic but I can just be cool and process the situation. Sometimes that makes people wonder if I'm a psychopath though."
socialanxiety,fen40kl,t1_fem8m6u,1579276478.0,I learned to close my eyes and it's been working out for me for the past 7 years.
socialanxiety,fen3vui,t1_fem55c6,1579276396.0,It's hard to believe I've been going to a barber by myself for 14+ years and still don't know the barbershop lingo. I have no idea what they're asking so I just say yes and hope they don't make me look like an idiot.
loseit,febutjk,t1_febeq81,1578962992.0,"I hope it does even out for me. My original goal weight was 200 lbs but my belly still looked so big that I lost another 20, and it's still out of proportion to the rest of me."
antiwork,fe95s22,t3_eo512f,1578934555.0,He's only 39? How the hell did he get so high up the chain so quickly?! Wikipedia doesn't say anything about his parents nor can I find anything about inherited wealth.

HabitExchange,fdihpeg,t3_elff1t,1578443164.0,"I have a variation of this: **only eat self-made sweets**. This was part of an effort for me to lose weight and turned out to actually be something I prefer doing. 

If I have a craving and there's nothing to snack on then it's battle of my reluctance to bake vs how much I really want that oatmeal banana cookie. Usually I'm too lazy to follow through with baking but if not, at least I'm controlling when goes into what I'm eating."
socialanxiety,fdhrgs0,t3_elffwk,1578428733.0,"In my late teens through early twenties I was typically awkward irl but socially-adept online. I even used to lead groups with confidence in games and was pretty popular for my laid-back style. Around the time my game(s) of choice died, real life caught up to me and I isolated myself from my online friends. I still had them on Skype and Discord but without a game to talk about, I reverted to my socially-awkward irl persona.

It's been about 5 years since and I'm still in a poor state socially tbh. My real life is pretty much in order since I have a steady job but my online experience pretty much sucks. I miss having gaming activities and friends online to look forward to every evening. With work though, I don't even have the time to enjoy games like I used to, even if I did find one I wanted to commit to."
socialanxiety,fdho0bz,t3_el538y,1578426692.0,"I have this recurring nightmare every month of so where I'm back at high school at 16 years old. The final bell rings and I rush out to the parking lot to get the hell out of there. My car's gone. Did I not drive to school today? I call my mum to ask if she's coming to pick me up. No, she says I drove. Now I'm in the parking lot looking like an idiot. Also, I have to pickup my sister. Where the fuck did my car go? Much panic. Eventually I wake up.

That situation never occurred in real life. In fact, between 16 and 17 was the best year of high school for me. I'd lost weight, got a gf (she adopted me basically), and was doing pretty well mentally. So idk why it keeps coming up."
socialanxiety,fdhmgvr,t1_fdgi0pn,1578425769.0,"I empathise with you but if there's one thing I regret losing because of social anxiety, it's my education. Take the time you need but don't be like me a let it get out of control."
loseit,fdh3jz7,t1_fdg7n5c,1578414617.0,Who?
antiwork,fde9d4i,t1_fdd386q,1578334048.0,"I always feel a bit guilty empathising with this sub because I am the son of a business owner. I know I'm probably better off than someone who works for a stranger but working for family has its own issues. Like the disappointment my boomer parents throw at me whenever I take a day off.

My only vacation last year was a single week in November and told my parents I was going overseas. My plans fell through but I didn't inform them because I didn't want to be ""on call"" during my week off. When my mum found out (her friend saw me grocery shipping or something) she was not pleased."

antiwork,fddnxhv,t1_fddch8k,1578319084.0,"No business is going to keep apple juice at $3.00 when everyone suddenly has access to $1000 more per month. For bigger businesses, simple greed and profit margins with drive prices up. For the smaller ones, it'll be the increased cost of living resulting from the bigger businesses raising their prices."
loseit,fcvzizw,t3_ej5sa5,1578013673.0,"My mum actually asked me if I'm bulimic recently. I'm 5'11 (180 cm) 180 lbs (81.6 kg), still classified as ""overweight"" on the BMI chart. Absolute madness."

If there was a tag to describe my orientation, this would be it."
socialanxiety,fcuqx9m,t3_eiv3t1,1577986693.0,"We don't know you nor him to know if your paranoia is justified but that's not even relevant here. If you're uncomfortable meeting a guy by yourself, bring a friend, ideally your boyfriend. Ask him if it's okay if you bring a friend (no need to say who it is) and if he has a problem with that then say you and that friend have other plans."
antiwork,fcubsy8,t1_fcu781x,1577977302.0,"I don't share your view but I understand it. Ultimately, I don't see the point in thinking like you do because it effectively comes down to nothing means anything. And while that may be true, my life can't be improved by thinking that way. All I'm trying to do is enjoy my existence. When that is out of my control then I may as well kill myself."
antiwork,fcuarls,t1_fcu6tps,1577976619.0,"I don't go to a gym. I have an elliptical and a basic weight set at home. I either do 4 miles on the elliptical in 29-30 minutes or 5 workout exercises over 45 minutes. As much as I'd like to do pre and post-workout exercises, I can't imagine committing any more free time to it."
antiwork,fcu67ky,t1_fctmap5,1577973530.0,"My usual post-work routine is eating while watching YouTube -> watching more YouTube -> playing mindless video games -> maybe programming (my real passion) -> brush teeth -> work out -> shower -> reading -> bed. Starting today, I'm going to try working out immediately after work and hope that clears away the post-work funk.

**Edit:**

It's only 2.5 hours into my work day and I just want to go home and sleep. I don't see how I'm going to be in the frame of mind to workout after another 5+ hours of this."
antiwork,fcu3kji,t1_fcs95zq,1577971561.0,"I only want to do nothing because I have to work. If I actually had sessions longer than 1-2 hours that I could commit to doing things I like (or used to like as a kid), then I'd do more things.

Right now I wake up at 6 AM, leave home at 8:30, work until 5 PM, get home around 5:20, and sleep around 1 AM. Trying to cram activities that require actual thought into those time slots along with basic functions like eating, brushing my teeth, showering, keeping my apartment clean, buying groceries, laundry, and a dozen other things, feels impossible on a consistent basis. So I watch YouTube, play video games I barely like, and browse the internet for things I forget within minutes."
loseit,fckrybo,t3_ehpmcs,1577731895.0,"I've been doing cardio (elliptical) for 2.5 years now and despite massive success (120 lbs down), I hate every minute of it. I guess I just hate being fat more."
socialanxiety,fck3jhk,t1_fcitggt,1577715527.0,I'm hoping that as more boomers leave the workforce we will get to a point where phone calls (and human interaction in general) become less and less common.
socialanxiety,fck36y7,t1_fch5hzl,1577715222.0,"I used to prepare a script as well but it never helped - the person on the other end kept losing their copy.

Between my job that involves a lot of phone calls and just caring less as I get older, I'm able to make calls without that crippling feeling of dread anymore. I still absolutely hate doing it though."
