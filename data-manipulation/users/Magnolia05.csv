childfree,ffwzi9m,t1_ffwwt3f,1580314501.0,"Sorry, was thinking of the wrong sub. Found the one you were referring to.  I was thinking of the antinatalsist sub."
childfree,ffwvv47,t1_ffwnz34,1580312197.0,Is it the sub that doesn’t want anyone to have kids ever?
solotravel,ffpj5d7,t3_etkzum,1580096281.0,"There is a consumer advocate guy in the US named Clark Howard, and I’ve always liked his travel advice.  If you find a really great deal on a flight, jump on it then figure out why you’d want to go there.  He says it more eloquently, but that’s basically what it boils down to."
tampa,ffoxiz6,t3_eue9gt,1580083045.0,"Maybe try posting this in the St Petersburg sub. Not sure if there is a Clearwater sub too,  it since that’s where the beaches are you’ll get better answers."
clevercomebacks,ffosjuj,t1_ffnk7jx,1580081157.0,"This is infuriating to me.  I lived in Tampa and St Pete for about ten years, but had to move out of state for work a while back.  Now that I’m wanting and ready to move back, I can’t find anything in a decent neighborhood that I can afford as a single Gen-X with a very modest income.  It’s heartbreaking, because I didn’t want to leave in the first place and want so badly to move back."
todayilearned,ffnvfk6,t1_ffmhmid,1580071364.0,Bingo.
todayilearned,ffmfa6s,t1_ffmc6v2,1580053787.0,My best friend worked for a huge company with a very large remote workforce.  They built a very fancy new high rise building in the city and started making everyone that was formerly remote come in to the office.  People were furious. Seems so backward!
todayilearned,ffmeoka,t1_ffmcmz1,1580053478.0,"Here’s the thing.... they don’t, really.  I work in the same smallish building as a similar company.  They have a large enough bar that they have three or four kegs delivered at a time, they all bring their dogs to work, etc.  It does seem like a great atmosphere!  But I’ve talked to a couple of our building management people who say the employees there work really long hours, and routinely don’t leave until 7-10pm sometimes.  Can’t help but think they have to do they because they spend part of the day just fucking around.  That might be great for some people, but although I like my job, I like to get in and get out off the office as soon as I can."
SandersForPresident,ffjwkak,t1_ffju8bl,1580008911.0,"My point is that the post is disingenuous to the extreme.  If 5% is enough to even remotely be a hardship, he can fill out the financial forms with the hospital and they will write it off.  I know this for a fact, because my brother had to do it at this exact hospital."
SandersForPresident,ffju15y,t1_ffjspf1,1580006925.0,"Thanks, I appreciate your input."
SandersForPresident,ffjtrxj,t1_ffji2c6,1580006727.0,"You’re absolutely right.  Even if he does have a high copay, all you have to do is fill out a form that says you can’t afford it, and they’ll usually write it off.  My brother was in this exact hospital for a little over two months a few years ago, to the tune of roughly a million dollars. Want to take a guess how much he paid out of pocket?"
SandersForPresident,ffjsmfx,t1_ffj2b0d,1580005843.0,"You do see the part about this not being a bill too, right?"
SandersForPresident,ffjsica,t3_etv4h0,1580005755.0,"Am I the first person to point out that this explicitly says “this is not a bill” and it does not say  he owes anything? I’ve seen tons of these, from this exact hospital, as a matter of fact.  These are sent out before insurance is applied. I’d bet anything that this guy doesn’t owe anything remotely close to what this says."
LadyBoners,ffgrl4g,t1_fffr1yn,1579913265.0,I don’t see it either.  I don’t think he is even remotely as attractive as Richard Madden.

childfree,fen3uwe,t1_femy9sn,1579276379.0,"Again, you’re 100% correct about this.  The OP is not in the wrong in her feelings at all, but this post is beyond childish and immature.  In the future when people point to this thread as an example of why were all crazy and hateful people , I honestly cannot defend it.  And I’m really tired of trying to defend it."
childfree,femtkib,t1_femrexn,1579269212.0,"Totally agree with you.  I defend this sub all the time, but posts like this one make it hard.  This is why people say we’re the nutjobs."

Atlanta,feeiuwl,t3_eopshs,1579034639.0,There is a guy I’ve seen at artist markets that makes cool collars out of men’s ties.  Search Facebook for Tucker Tie Collars.  My dog has one and gets compliments on it a lot.
wholesomememes,fdkvqn3,t1_fdktzlc,1578512152.0,"Yep.  If a southern lady ever, ever says “bless your heart”, and your grandmother isn’t sick or your house burned down or something legitimately sad, you are most likely being called a dumbass."
wholesomememes,fdkqvvd,t1_fdklba0,1578509271.0,"Mostly if it’s followed by a “bless your heart,” though.    You can usually tell by the context."

aww,fdcnw0z,t1_fdcbdi1,1578279586.0,"If you have a Marshall’s, TJ Maxx, or HomeGoods store in your area, they pretty much always have great larger dog beds for about that much, sometimes less."
Aquariums,fd6ccmz,t3_ek09sn,1578188806.0,"The house next door to my childhood home had one.  My aunt and uncle lived there, so I was there a lot.  The original builder of the neighborhood married a Japanese lady, and built her a Japanese inspired house.  It was so beautiful.  Dark hardwood floors when you walked in, and about 15 or so feet from the front door the pond was dropped maybe 6-8 ft in total down from the floor.  There was area around the actual pond for plants, and they had a ton of huge elephant ears, palms, stuff like that. The whole pond area  was maybe 10’x15’? Bridge (no rail!) over the whole thing.  Tons of koi, stone waterfall at one end.  Skylights above.  Dining room on the other side.  Not gonna lie, I was livid and teared up a little when I heard the owners closed it up a few years after my aunt and uncle sold it."

suggestmeabook,fcs6kvs,t1_fcqzpoh,1577912150.0,I kind of felt that way about Slash’s autobiography.  What I ended up doing is just flipping to random chapters and reading bits and pieces. Never read through the whole thing.
television,fci5r98,t1_fcgy7us,1577658088.0,"I think a lot of people who say “I don’t get the hype, it was just ok” or whatever are seriously underestimating the draw of Henry Cavill.  There are tons of women who are watching this entirely for the eye candy."
