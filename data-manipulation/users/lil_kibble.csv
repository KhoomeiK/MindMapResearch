cursedcomments,ffjny63,t1_ffixsgm,1580002642.0,"Granted. Your crush falls in love with you and consistantly sends you nudes sometimes three or four times a day. At first you are aroused and you enjoy this new attention. You begin to fall in love with her too. A few months go by as she continues to try her very hardest to please you with the pictures she sends. But soon you realize that you felt for her wasn't really love, only infatuation for her body. You decide to break it off with her.

She is heartbroken by this. After trying so hard to make you happy, she feels as though her body wasn't good enough. She begins to eat less so that no one will leave her again. The image she has of herself will always be a little bit scarred because she feels as though she gave a piece of herself to you and you didn't want her anymore. She will eventually get better and will find someone who really loves her for who she is, but their relationship will always be affected by her past.

Many years later, you meet someone. Someone special. You start to take in interest in her and you spend more time with her. Your relationship with her is different from your past relationships. You decide that you won't ask her for nudes or sex too early. You want her to feel appreciated for who she is. One day you take her to a very nice restaurant. You ask her to marry you. She says yes.

You're both very happy. But something is off with your sexual life. After so many years of porn and nudes from other girls, she finds that you don't seem to enjoy your nights together as much as she expected. She feels as though she isn't enough for you and begins to distrust you. After some time, you come home from work early one day and catch your wife with another man: a man who, she feels, has more sexual energy with her."

In her edit she little just makes fun of him for being friendly and helpful while bagging groceries. I have a lot of respect for the guy. It's hard to be cheerful when dealing with people like her for a while day. Also, community college is a great deal and a good financial decision. Good for him for not signing up for way too much debt."

QuotesPorn,ff3ecdh,t1_ff2rpho,1579539351.0,"Community college is significantly cheaper and can be free for two years if you do dual enrollment. This might change based on state/school.

I'm getting my associates in arts degree at a community college right now and a local University has a deal where if you transfer from this specific community college you can get the other two years for just $2500 a year. Not $25,000. $2500.

There are definitely cheaper alternatives. Please don't go into debt for anything other than a house."
