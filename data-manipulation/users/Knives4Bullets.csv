unpopularopinion,fggnqge,t3_eyagt6,1580765675.0,"I’m autistic. I’m bad at communicating, I constantly feel lonely and left out of groups. During my life I have had maybe 2 or 3 meaningful friendships. 

But when I do something, it seems to make people laugh. I have noticed patterns that do make them laugh, and making jokes is the best thing I can do, intentional or not. Absurdity seems to work the best, things I actually find funny(The recent Lego City meme) not so much. Making jokes is a good way to compensate. 


Thanks for enjoying our jokes :)"
