Many of us make the same mistakes over and over, without recognizing our contribution to the pattern.  You have a former partner who obviously still regards you as a person of value, as you do her, and that is very mature.
Your introspection will be a huge asset in your next relationship, and eventual parenting.  Keep putting your best face out there, and your special someone will find their way to you.  Virtual hugs from a fellow depressive, and occasional self loather.  Hang in there."

depression_help,fcol4jr,t1_fco8bcx,1577834969.0,"O.k., I may be old and irrelevant, but I had to look up what the ""topnine"" was, so I could see if it generated the same feelings in me.  It did not, and by all accounts, I am a depressed, cynical, and often pessimistic person.. But the topnine on Instagram just looked to me like people expressing themselves, and trying really hard to look like they mattered to something or someone.
Please don't compare yourself to anyone...we're all just trying to get by.
Some just don't get mired down by things like sadness and self doubt;
You ever hear the phrase, ""they're just as happy as if they had sense""?
That's how non empaths look to me.
You are a living, breathing force of nature, and you can do with that what you wish.  Don't believe the hype.
Happy New Year...I'm keeping my expectations low; easier to live up to:)"
