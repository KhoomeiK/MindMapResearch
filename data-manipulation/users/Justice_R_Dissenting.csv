law,ffcj4ib,t1_ffcib2k,1579800561.0,">not just have it kick in alerts if somebody leaves an area they are not supposed to?

This is still going to have a similar amount of expense.  The way, most, probation systems work is to have POs with a caseload of clients they're watching.  When one of them violates, based on their discretion they decide who gets a VOP charge and who doesn't, based on attendant circumstances and the likelihood of that charge to be sustained. 

Geo-monitoring can be problematic when you have to respond to every time the guy goes out of the zone.  Unless you can eliminate all false-positives (which you can't), the PO has to go investigate whether or not the guy went into the no-go zone.  That takes time, and you're paying the PO to do it (probably overtime). 

If you were to convert thousands, if not millions, of people in jails to the geo-monitored ankle system you would need a massive increase in POs, the rapid introduction of new technology to many jurisdictions, and finally something to filter the overwhelming volume of VOP hearings that the courts would need to entertain."

Without that, you're now also generating VOP hearings that are likely to be dismissed which just wastes everyone's time.

We had this problem in Baltimore, to be honest it's only ""cheaper"" if you overload probation officers.  An ankle monitor still requires a human to monitor it, and if you have thousands of people on them it becomes difficult to keep track of them all.  Plus the relative ease of removal makes it hard for a court to justify that they're actually preventing flight or enforcing compliance with court dates.

worldnews,fedbbc7,t1_feda595,1579006484.0,">Why should it be any different than someone who is over 18?

Fundamentally it's an argument of capacity.  In nearly all cases involving children sentenced to die in prison, there's an incredible amount of mitigation that is completely ignored by the courts because of the public outcry.

Stevenson talks about a young man who shot and killed his stepfather -- who was in the process of brutalizing his mother.  Stepdad, however, was a police officer, so there was a call for blood.

Day 1 of lock-up for the child was spent being vigorously raped in the adult section of the jail.

In another case, he relayed the story of a girl named Trina.  Trina's father abused her mother and when she died, began abusing her and her sisters.  From a young age she was intellectually stunted and suffered injuries.  She ended up fleeing the house, staying in whatever temporary shelter she could find.  Eventually, she went to visit a friend's house and while trying to light a candle set the house aflame.  After repeatedly being found incompetent to stand trial, she was eventually convicted of 2nd degree murder and sentenced to life without parole.  She was 16.  At prison, she was immediately raped by a CO and gave birth in prison.

A 13 year old Florida boy shot a woman during a botched armed robbery.  He was encouraged to plead guilty, his lawyer believing he would only get 15 years.  He was sentenced to life without parole.  As a juvenile in the adult system, he was put in solitary where he went hysterically insane.  The woman he shot came out as a powerful advocate for his release, but her pleas for mercy went unheeded.

A South Central LA child of 16 was involved in a kidnapping scheme, pressured by adults to join them in a fake kidnapping attempt.  Nobody was injured in the process, but the child Antonio was given a life without parole sentence (even though LA had banned life sentences for juveniles who commit murder).

Despite little physical evidence, Joe Sullivan was sentenced to death in prison for sexual battery -- despite the only two witnesses being burglary accomplices who admitted to the rape themselves, and the victim had only vague flashes of Joe.  A single latent print and self-serving testimony of the accomplices, with zero DNA evidence despite seminal fluids being collected, convicted Joe.

The list goes on, and it goes on and on and on.  The most powerful part of Stevenson's piece is when he gets these cases appealed to the Supreme Court and is joined by *amicus* briefs from adults who had juvenile criminal records who turned out completely fine, from **former child soldiers** who talked about how radically their lives had changed, and an outpouring of support from across the country and world.

The sheer volume of the trauma suffered by these children is incomprehensible to the average American.
