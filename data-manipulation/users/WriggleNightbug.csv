I question what the actual purpose of denoting virgin vs non-virgin means in this context.  From a semantic perspective, is someone who has had anal sex once more or less of a virgin than someone who has had vaginal sex once? What is the need to say ""everything before here was this, and everything after here is that""?

Your argument holds the most value in the context of talking with girls who are having similar situations and are going through the similar questions of recovery and self-definition.  Its a metaphor that drives home the point that their sexuality is a narrative they control now.  You and them do get the choice to say ""here is where my dating, casual, or active sexual experience begin"".

I think it might make more sense when talking to your co-workers to use different verbiage but I don't really have advice on how to bridge the two needs.  Especially if you have turn-over in staff and need to begin your story and why your way of telling it matters."

personalfinance,fcidpc0,t3_eha6l5,1577661010.0,"Hello.  There are lots and lots of side considerations that need to be passed trough your financial Aid Office.  The question the really needs to be answered is why your mom is not willing to provide taxes.  

If she hasn't filed taxes from the prior-prior tax years (2017 for the current year, 2018 for Fall20-Spring21) then she can get proof that she has an extension or proof that she didn't file from the IRS and use that instead.

If she doesn't want to support you through loans (which is absolutely fair), she needs to understand that providing information is not a credit check nor an obligation to take out the Parent PLUS loan.  She will not take on any more debt than she is willing to but as a dependent student, you are unable to get a Federal Direct Student Loan without a complete and verified FAFSA which includes her info and/or your other parent's info and may become a headache with verification.

If she wants to support you via loans but doesn't think her credit qualifies then she needs to provide info and apply anyway.  If she is denied for the loan 1) you qualify for up to $2500 additional per semester as a Junior or 2) she can appeal/endorse the loan or 3) she may qualify anyway because the bar for credit on the Parent PLUS loan is lower than a normal loan.

If you are at risk of homelessness, over an age where you count as dependent, ex-mil, married or with a kid you are supporting at least 50% of the time you would be considered independent and may have an additional $2500 minus ~1% fees per semester.  The homeless option is rare and relies on the professional judgment of the school.

The biggest (possible) issue with Federal Direct Loans (Parent PLUS or Student Direct) at this point is if you are not registered for Spring classes, you will not be legally allowed to originate the loans.  This is an issue depending on how your school allows enrollment with a past due balance.  It may be a non-issue for you or it may be insurmountable.

For anything related to the Federal Direct Loan Process you should speak with your Financial Aid office directly once they reopen in the Spring.

If you are looking at Private Loans (i.e. your bank, any other major bank, or lenders specific to schools) then the question is based on the particular bank.  They will require you to have a credit history or a credit worthy endorser/co-signer to lend you any funds.  These rates may be better than the Federal Direct Interest Rates or they may not, since its based on your specific information I can't tell you whats better or worse.  I can tell you I have seen private loans for as little as $2,000 and as high as $50,000 for a single year.  The upper limits are based on your school's standard budget for in-state/out-of-state and the other aid you are receiving and based on the bank's assessment of your credit.

Edit: It can also be hard to speak with your Financial Aid office because they live these issues day-in/day-out and may expect you to know things you don't know or speak about things with an internal jargon.  Go in with a notebook, be willing to be dumb, and ask not just about your immediate issue but find out the next two or three steps after that."
