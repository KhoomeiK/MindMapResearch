When you talk to people like you're their parent it generally rubs them the wrong way and almost universally guarantees that any further communication is useless because it is disrespectful.

My anxieties also cause me to think words and phrases that would provoke terrible and unpleasant consequences if acted upon. For example, I am straight and was always thinking gay stuff around other guys and the n word came to mind every time I saw a black guy.

I still do it, but I am pretty sure I always did; Although, before the Adderall, it may have only manifested in the feelings, and not the formation of the offending phrases. It doesn't bother me toa bad now. Now I just think: ""FUCK IT"" and I blast the n words and gay shit with a smile.
