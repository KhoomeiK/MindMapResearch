Moreover, we live in an ever more connected world so we are exposed to more news stories more often from everywhere all at once than any generation before us.  So even if the world isn't actually worse than it used to be, and even if this January isn't as horrible as it seems, we're being exposed to more news than we would have 20+ years ago.  Taken from someone else's post here is a list of things that have happened so far in January (with some extra additions):

* Senate vote 51-49 against witnesses in Donald J. Trump's Impeachment Trial
* Coronavirus with an R0 of 4.08 spreading rapidly in China effectively shutting down cities
* Billions of locusts (soon to be trillions) in four of Africa's major countries causing crop loss
* Assassination of Soleimani almost leading to a hot conflict between the US and Iran
* hot conflict between US and Iran leads to Iran accidentally shooting down a domestic flight
* Australian fires are currently approaching its capital, Canberra
* Kobe Bryant and his daughter's abrupt death
* Taal Volcano's eruption in the Philippines
* 7.8 magnitude earthquake striking Jamaica
* 5.8 magnitude earthquake striking Puerto Rico
* Australian wildfires causing billions worth in damages and is only half-way over
* More than a billion animals are suspected of dying in the Australian bushfires
* Puerto Ricans still not getting relief from old hurricanes, finding warehouses of relief aid stored and unused.
* USDA confirming that overall 2019 planted acreage total lowest since 1970
* Davos summit confirming that global warming will do inevitable damage to global GDP (while USA politicians are too busy bullying a teenage girl rather than admit it's real).
* Zimbabwe drought and food crisis to extend deeper into 2020 as its economy collapses
* NOAA confirming that CO2 atmospheric concentration reached a new record 413.99 passing 2018's record
* Bulletin of Atomic Scientists setting Doomsday Clock at 100 seconds to midnight
* Scientists discovering ancient, never-before-seen viruses in glaciers
* India's vegetables monthly inflation rate spiked to 60% due to food supply shocks due to extreme weather
* Most of 11 million trees planted in Turkey's tree-planting project are found to be dead
* Brexit happened.

I spent around $10k in emergency vet bills trying to save her for her to die a few days later anyway.  I was devastated.  I felt like such a failure that I didn't notice the signs sooner, when there might've been a chance to save her... and I felt so awful that her last few days were so horrible; if I knew there was no hope I wouldn't have put her through all she went through trying to find out what was wrong (laproscopic surgery, a few days spent at the emergency vet).  I would've just let her enjoy her final days at home instead of a strange doctor's office.  Though her final day was spent at home.  Even though the money spent was ""wasted"" I don't regret trying.  But I am lucky enough to be financially well off enough that dropping $10k on a dog unexpectedly wasn't the end of my world, either.  At another time in my life that wouldn't have been an option. 

A few years later I've now got another dog fresh out of a $5k surgery for a bad leg/knee.  That dog will be just fine barring any rare complications.

As of a few hours ago we now have pet insurance because $15k on sick dogs is a lot of fucking money."
