I'm tired of getting no help what so ever from so called trained professionals."

I love your Sega gamegear.
Had one when I was a kid and was my favourite toy.
Only hated it needing so many batteries!"
offmychest,ff4wqkr,t3_erhisj,1579574285.0,"The thing with cheating I cannot stand is how little that person must feel towards their partner.

I went through a bad marriage with my ex wife having 2 affairs, her lying and making sure that her tracks were covered. She convinced me time and time again I had nothing to worry about until I found everything out and all the pieces just fit into place.

Should have seen it coming after the first time but always wanting to see the good people led to it happening again.

It's heartbreaking like genuinely fucked me up and still even now its been over a year, I'm now divorced and she's still with the guy who was a friend of ours that she had the second affair with. It never gets any easier to cope with. 


It's a disgrace that it happens so often and that there is no concern or thought for the other person.
I hate it and even worse I'm still blaming myself for everything.

Everything I've been through I thought someone would always be there, I was gravely mistaken :("
offmychest,ff0bnpr,t1_ff09qzd,1579467312.0,"I get somewhat how he must feel being a long and close friend but there are things you just don't know sometimes. 
There's nothing wrong with hoping to always see the good in people it's just a shame that sometimes those people can really surprise you. 

I really hope that a resolution comes quickly without your partner being dragged into it more."

7 years worth of wasting money."
offmychest,ff085bf,t3_er0dot,1579466203.0,"Going through school I was close friends to a few people, one of which after school I had worked with for some time and then eventually grew apart.

I'm glad I did as it came out several years back and several years after we last saw each other than he was charged with something similar. He had 16,000 pictures and videos of children some even of his own child.
It really shook me as it was something I never thought would happen, something you could never imagine someone doing.

You never know what people can hide and that's a genuinely terrifying thing to think about.

I hope that everything isn't what you fear but several people will be happy to see him charged if it does happen to be true."
offmychest,fezxn58,t1_feyxugj,1579463034.0,"Unfortunately yeah good friend of both of ours(well so I thought) , was still sleeping with me while she was sleeping with him. Only found out after she had cut all contact which also happened to be the day my dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Was a horrible horrible year in all. Hopefully it will get better this year, that's all I can hope for now."
offmychest,feyuvdn,t3_equlvf,1579450815.0,"Had this, ex wife left me after getting with a friend of ours. Been a year and today went into my local Wetherspoons only to be banned as she's told everyone some crap that they've all bought (she works there, we've had no contact in over a year) it's pretty stupid how people change so much."

You'll find that person who makes you feel better than number 1.
Some people are asses but not all of them.
It's hard to feel good when you feel like this but I promise you it won't be forever.

It'll be one of those annoying situations that you'll find someone when you've given up the search for a while yaknow.

I'm sorry you feel like this but I hope it all works out soon and you find that person who makes you feel amazing!"
offmychest,fecy3ny,t1_fecu0ii,1578989354.0,Thank you so much.
offmychest,fecqeem,t1_fecpwro,1578980809.0,"Feels like a losing battle and has for a while, I haven't given in yet though. There's still some hope in me deep down but it's seeing it through all the other stuff inside.
Thank you for your message!"
offmychest,fecq8qu,t1_fecplyt,1578980662.0,"It's really nice to see such a positive response from someone, honestly I thank you. Nice to not feel so alone.

I've felt myself and can see myself closing off just haven't got the willpower to stop myself from caving inwards.
I want to be happy again, want to be able to look at the day and think this is what I want to accomplish today.

I know I'm probably not in a place to have a relationship at all but doesn't help the feelings of wanting some company and to feel wanted again yaknow.

There's some logical thoughts going around but it's all foggy under everything else that's swarming in there.

Your message really did stop the tears so honestly I thank you for that."
