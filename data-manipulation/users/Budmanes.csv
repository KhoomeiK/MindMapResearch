You had mentioned before that if you got a transplant, they’d take away your disability.  Are you sure?  I might try talking with someone not associated with the dialysis center (doesn’t sound like they’re shooting 100% straight with you.  With your arm, you may be eligible regardless of the kidneys.  The dialysis center may not inform you of that because they’d lose the revenue from your treatment.  It blows that medical care here has come to that, but...  Most decent sized towns have a Social Security office & they would be happy to give you insight into your options.  I just hate to see you struggling when you could have options that you may not know of."

If you are able to play video games (as you stated earlier), I believe you would be able to perform PD.  Maybe it would be worth telling your social worker that if they cannot give you a real reason why you can’t do PD (oh, by the way, I got rid of the cat wink, wink), then you will hop a bus and find a clinic elsewhere that will.  I’m not one who would recommend being untruthful with healthcare folks, but it really sounds like they are more interested in profits than in you.  They deliver the supplies to your home, so after training, you would be set.
