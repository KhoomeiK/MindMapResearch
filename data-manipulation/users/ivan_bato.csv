suicidebywords,fffq7e5,t3_et95wq,1579889418.0,This is bassicly the idea of the movie ''Night Of The Living Dead''. Totally recommend it. Very suspenseful movie
HentaiFree,feysrb7,t1_fbjtmys,1579450155.0,"If it eats away much time, for example, you go to the bathroom at work to fap,  etc... If it takes away much time, time you could use to do something productive,  then its bad.  Otherwise its not so bad :)"
HentaiFree,feyr57o,t3_em1sdk,1579449599.0,"I just want to say that I see myself in you. It is as if I wrote it.  Everything seemed to spiral down after I discovered hentai. I'm frickin' scared and terrified because lolis seem to turn me on the most... Feel free to private-message me,  we could talk about eachother's stories.,  because I think we have much in common."
HentaiFree,feyq1lh,t3_em44sx,1579449107.0,"I would advise you not to mention that you are christian in advice-seeking posts,  because all you will get is ""stay true to jesus, don't sin, pray, be respectful to your lord,  read the bible, follow jesus "" and that kind of bullcrap. If you really think about it,  that won't help. Jesus won't help,  and god doesn't help.  Sorry for my pessimism,  but as far as I know,  if you don't help yourself,  no one will. And,  just please avoid praying,  1. It doesn't do anything,  and 2. You could use that time for something that really does help. I just want to say that I see myself in you. I'm also a teenager, and as I read your story,  it was as if it was me who wrote it... I also discovered porn at a dangerously young age.  Everything seemed to spiral down after I discovered hentai just like you. I'm frickin' scared and terrified because lolis seem to turn me on the most... I wish you the best of luck brother, and success in you addiction healing. Maybe I was a bit harsh with the beginning of this comment, but know that all I want is to help,  and I speak from my experience. Feel free to private-message me,  we could talk about eachother's stories.,  because I think we have much in common. Best regards!"

Haha. Don't say it twice"
teenagers,fcys9ds,t3_ejhadn,1578085984.0,"As I found out about it, i got really pissed and scared tbh... How can people possibly laugh about it. It's nothing to post memes about, we should really pray and hope that nothing happens to our lives. I wish everyone who is joking about it knew what this really means. It means war, which is hell. Like I said, pray so it doesn't happen"

teengirlswholikegirls,fcq7m0w,t3_ei7t50,1577880446.0,"She might be exploring herself, or searching for things she might like :)...  If what you are saying is true, then I must say that I doubt that she's straight... I was in a similar situation, but when she started to see that I'm into her, she couldn't help but distance herself from me :/. I guess 90% of straight girls would do that... So I think that she might be actually closeted or scared :)"
socialanxiety,fck910s,t3_ehir4w,1577719858.0,"This is exactly what I was going to post. I left this subreddit for a while because all there was were only memes and jokes about depression! And I hate this. This should be a serious sub, focused on curing anxiety, because it's a serious problem, and not a joke. Thanks for contributing to the solution"
