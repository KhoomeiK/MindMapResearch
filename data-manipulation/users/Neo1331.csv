RobinHoodPennyStocks,fff6vky,t3_et5nee,1579877224.0,"Stop playing pennies...go find some good stocks between 15 and 45 and watch them, when they dip buy or find etfs that pay good dividends. Then when you get a feel for it comeback and trade pennies. The nice thing with RH is the no fee, I bought 2 shares of Wells Fargo the start of the week and made $2 in a day. Its not much but it cost me nothing (but taxes) to do it."

RobinHood,fff63zc,t3_et4hcy,1579876667.0,"r/robinhoodpennystocks is a good sub. If you have the time to do your DD. I was up 70% last year just playing around with pennies, some were up over 300% for the year. One of my stocks was up 60% a few days ago, sold that as soon as I saw. Its a different world though so I wouldn’t dive in maybe instead of 1000’s a day 100’s? Just my 2 cents...."
RobinHood,fff5rcx,t3_et44w4,1579876412.0,Yes but did you sell at a profit? /s good job!
