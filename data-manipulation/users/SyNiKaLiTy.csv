Good God, you are a TDS infested piece of human trash. Give me a second, I'll be over to fuck your  girl properly you soy infused cuck.

StarWarsEmpireAtWar,fc3qpsb,t1_fc3qjr3,1577396231.0,K dude. Keep stealing valor like the piece of shit you truly are.
StarWarsEmpireAtWar,fc3qbgv,t1_fc3oxll,1577395960.0,"No you didn't have to, but because YOU brought it up(by claiming to be ""blown up""), it's entirely reasonable for me to question it, especially as it was completely unwarranted for you to even mention it in the first place, but you felt the need to inject it into a conversation. Given the 'type' people like you chose to rub shoulders with, ingratiating on the ""truth/what actually happened"" is quite common amongst your 'community'. 

I clicked because of SW EAW, but had a simple question. You brought it up, completely unrelated to the topic at hand. You could have easily left it at the first sentence and these following posts would never have happened. 

The point is, people who actually served, vs the fakes like you who claim to have experienced something and describe it in such a vague manner, it sets off some red flags in those that actually HAVE experienced things that you claim to have as well as trivialize the experience of those who've actually had it happen to them, kind of how PTSD has lost almost ALL of it's meaning nowadays and why myself, and several other CV's have gone back to saying ""Shellshock"".

I'm not saying your ""struggling"" isn't publicly visible, I'm saying it never fucking happened in the way you claim it 'did'. Seeing as how you've outright neglected to give any details, even so much as Branch of Service, is proving to me, beyond a shadow of doubt, one of several things:

You're fake, you're a liar, you're probably using it to gain sympathy/attention, (Extremely common amongst your 'type') and you don't fuck around trying to steal Valor from those who have actually experienced it. 

I think a little inquiry to the DoD will help clarify things. Just know, that you're the one who brought it up by claiming to be ""blown up""."
StarWarsEmpireAtWar,fc3oc6j,t1_fc3mv7b,1577394549.0,"Yea.... not one part of this seems legit to me looking at it. I'm calling BS. Anyone I know who's ever come back from tours over seas that's seen combat and been as close to it as you claim to have been, is not nearly this... open/colorful? Don't even know if that's the right word to describe how fake it feels.

Even that 2nd statement is so dismissive/dodgy it seems like it's made up. When something is as 'messed up' as it seems you're claiming, most people come right out and say where it is so other people won't go there instead of trying to add such a 'veil of mystery' about it.

If you did serve, I'm willing to bet it was a NonCom role and you were at a desk of some kind. As someone who has served, has seen combat, been ""shot/shot at, cut open"", and had mortar's land far to close for comfort; when you use the term 'blown up' makes me think you haven't a fucking clue what that really means. I have friends who were. Were. Past tense, meaning they're fucking dead. Or for those that are still alive, have severe scarring, lost limbs etc.

Even more 'ironic' is that I've had explosions go off near me/other people I know who've been hit by the concussive blast, had the wind knocked out of them and knocked on their ass, and not ONE of them describes themselves as getting ""blown up"".

If you are indeed served, What branch? What regiment? Where you first stationed/home base? How many tours?

Stolen Valor isn't something to fuck around with.."
