You don't live in a bubble, we all live on this planet together, whether you like it or not we all depend on each other and need to take care of each other. Besides which, we have the technological means to create an abundance of resources so NO ONE has to live at the expense of another.

Do you know what artificial scarcity is?"
metacanada,ffxrme8,t1_ffwzfyh,1580331054.0,"The health care in this country is trash. I have a congenital birth defect that involves my teeth and because of that, the system refuses to do anything about it. It affects my ability to eat (functional disability), makes me vomit every couple of weeks and lose several days of pay, I've thought about killing myself more times than I can count. I'm hardworking, bright, ethical and kind to my co-workers/employees, and would pay back the cost of the Ortho and dental care TWENTYFOLD in income taxes if I were working full-time LIKE I WANT TO. It doesn't even make financial sense for the gov't. They would make more money in taxes over my lifetime if they actually did what they are mandated to do and provide good quality health care. I'd be paying $20k per year - minimum - just in income taxes, nevermind pension, EI, other source deductions. One single year of income tax would pay for all the dental/Ortho I need if I was working full time.

The lack of decent health care is keeping me in poverty when I have the skillset and work ethic to make a decent living, I'm not lazy, I'm not a deadbeat, I fucking survived 10 years of violent child abuse in foster care (which is why my teeth/jaws are so fucked in the first place) and the Canadian govt DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT.

Meanwhile, the government is paying for sex reassignment surgery and paying airfare for trans people to come to Quebec to get surgery, and I empathize with trans people but gender dysphoria is not a major functional disability and they are stealing money from people who desperately need surgery, dental care, health care to address FUNCTIONAL health problems that prevent them from walking, eating, breathing and seeing.

Fuck Justin Trudeau. Cannot tell you how much I despise that fucking scumbag.

Trudeau has done absolutely NOTHING to help poor and working class Canadians. Hope all his teeth get smashed out of his face so he knows what it's like to have fucked up, excruciatingly painful teeth. Scum. Nothing but scum.

Edit: sorry. I spent most of the past two days vomiting. I'm fucking sick and ENRAGED at the state of health care in Canada. Force me to suffer all this pain, for what?! They're LOSING money by not providing adequate health care. It doesn't make economic sense."

Also keep an eye on nightshade plants (tomatoes, eggplant, goji/wolfberries, white potatoes). I've had to replace white potatoes with sweet potatoes because white potatoes kept making me vom. Sweet potatoes are a different species.

&#x200B;

Huh. That's like Toronto Police letting Bruce McArthur to roam free as he was only targeting gay men.

AND Toronto Police drugged and raped one of their own female employees, the officers admitted to having sex with her when she was unconscious, and yet all three of them were found not-guilty.

They dragged her through the news in a similar way. Slut shamed her, dragged her through hell, when they KNEW they were guilty, and so did TPS. 

Despite CLEARLY raping her when she was unconscious and admitting it. No shadow of a doubt.

Toronto is a shithole.

Sorry. Bit triggered. Have had bad experiences with Canadian police dropping the ball on sexual assault and domestic abuse reports and doing absolute FUCK ALL to investigate or even question the perpetrators. Fuck Canada too."

Religion is the problem, especially when these major sects protect each others followers from prosecution.

I'm blaming Christianity, Judaism AND Islam. All three of these religions work together to subjugate women, murder homosexuals, sexually abuse children (IGM), and teach their followers that it's their God-given right and duty to kill non-believers.

The religion is definitely the problem.
