If I had intended to do him harm, taking off his legs would have taken legitimately *less* effort than leaving him uninjured. Some people are so fucking arrogant, they don't even consider their surroundings. Worst part is, the dumbass lied to the cop who went to speak to him, claimed I had run him down in my car and that his body had broken my windshield. Dude's like three hundred pounds and the break in my windshield is up along the top. Not to mention, you can clearly see where the edge and corner of the board hit; a body does *not* leave clean lines like that.

If the individual is in an overtly abusive environment, steps can and should be taken to extricate themselves. Hate to belabor the point here, but that *should* go without saying. It's also obviously *not* part of being a man in our society, any more than being bullied at school is. 

Anxiety is not equivalent to depression; the statement itself is ludicrous. Depression weighs you down, steals away your will to act; anxiety balls you up, tenses your muscles and claws at your brain. In that way, it is closer to anger, and what do you tell someone whose anger far exceeds situational demand? That they need to take a step back from the situation and *breath a bit*, gain perspective. Only they can let the emotion wash away, and they can only do that if they know that doing so is acceptable. Sometimes knowing that a situation is not universal, not guaranteed or acceptable, helps.

I could not back up because he had pulled his truck over, behind my car. He moved to the front of my car and was brandishing a board. Said there wasn't any way for me to leave, that he was going to smash my windshield if I hit his truck. I got my car started. He yelled ""what are you going to do, run me over?"" I looked at him like he was a fucking moron and, with a slight nod, responded ""yup"". I had no intention of staying put, and trying to body block a car is dumb as hell. He went a bit wide-eyed.

I was supposed to sleep on the couch, while she was all set up on the love seat. I was half zonked out on Christmas Eve, laying on the couch. She was trying to show me some video on her phone.

I must have fallen asleep because the next thing I knew, I was waking up hours later, unable to breath. Somehow, she had placed a pillow over my face and fallen asleep with her torso draped over it. I wiggled my head out from under the pillow, was able to extricate myself sufficiently to draw breath. Probably the worst way to wake up, that. She was not a light child."
TwoXChromosomes,ffoa0sy,t1_ffo7rax,1580075557.0,"Thankfully, her mother is largely out of her life at this point. She's out there somewhere, probably making more kids. She's had like four of them taken away by Child Protective Services at this point. It is a damn shame.

I am trying. Can't get the girl to commit to anything, but I help her with homework when she asks, try to instill a desire to learn. She did show some interest in tabletop games a while back, but she eventually became too disruptive for me to run anything. :(

I wish there was a secret aspie handshake. The only other aspie I know is thousands of miles away and... Has had wildly diverging experiences. She's nice, but had gotten kind of culty the last time I talked to her. Shame."
TwoXChromosomes,ffnzz9q,t1_ffnqija,1580072807.0,"Heh. I have Asperger's, ADHD, and OCD. She is not remotely introverted; I would describe her as a perpetual bull in a china shop, both physically and socially. She's kind of a pushy little brat.

To be honest, I have been worried she might have something wrong with her for a while, but her dad's excessively permissive (makes excuses) and her mom is possibly the worst human being I have ever known. (Physically violent, no impulse control, history of drug abuse, theft, etc. Her second child required seven paternity tests to track down the father. At the time, she had been with my brother for something like five years. Just a garbage person.) I am mostly concerned because of how slow she is. Even stuff she knows, it takes her forever to answer. She's ""thinking"". She has no idea what a map looks like (cannot draw one from memory even after I spent a week with her on it) and has incredibly rigid definitions for things.

Couple that with her ridiculous food phobias, I'm sure *something* is wrong. I just need to figure out how to get it identified, so she can get treated."
science,ffnxmoa,t1_ffnuf1t,1580072070.0,"This whole comment implies a level of choice that is not at all relatable. It isn't as though you have dozens of people to choose from. That is the problem. If more tolerable people were around, this would not be a problem.

Your comment reminds me of a couple disagreements I had with my ex, years ago. She described me as the nicest guy she ever dated, but would get upset with me because my demeanor was entirely dependent upon who I was dealing with. I could be utterly irate with one person, turn around and be happy and upbeat with the next person, inside of a minute or so. That makes sense to me, because obviously different people provoke different responses. Someone that insults and belittle you does not merit the same treatment as someone that is your friend, and allowing your emotions to spill over is wildly inappropriate.

She would also get annoyed with me because complaints and judgments were generally not an emotional thing for me. I could be perfectly happy, having a great time, but that would not change my perception. Similarly, I could be having a piss poor day, just miserable, but if I saw something I liked, I would still compliment it. I could be straight-up crying, but if someone walked in with boots I liked, I would compliment them. Because my emotions do not change the world.

My social life was better when I was in college. I was surrounded by intolerable fools, but there were plenty of decent people strewn throughout. I've just about never hung out with people from any of the places I've worked. Most are just foul people. The upbeat ones are too permissive, the more down to earth ones are just bad people. I don't want to hang out with someone that cheats on his wife, or that spends their entire vacation so piss-drunk she can't remember it, or that does not do their job.

My health has gotten worse in recent years. I'm stuck in rural Alaska, surrounded by family, with no friends and no real prospects. I am assuredly more bitter now than I used to be, but it does not matter. There aren't any people around here to connect with, anyway."

I had a really hard time while learning ASL because although my hand gestures were on point, my instructors always have me guff about not expressing adequately. Least favorite part of it, that.

I have established one emotional bond. That person isn't perfect. They were just respectful of my perspective. We could agree to disagree. Contrast this with my ex, who more than once tried to justify dismissing my feelings and experiences because I'm autistic, ""don't know better"". That's most people I've dealt with. They're shit at reading me, they do not care how I feel, and they are utterly convinced of their own superiority. Life is not long enough to waste fawning over those people."
science,ffnozln,t1_ffnnzww,1580068768.0,"Overtly insulting. Nice.

The problem is not that I'm some off-putting, unpalatable ogre. It's that finding people with whom a bond would be at all desirable is significantly more difficult, because most people's experiences and perspectives leave them unable to support their end. Hard to form a bond with someone that diminishes your perspective. Not worth pursuing.

I have no desire to be neurotypical. Frankly, I have seen what that does to people and I am unimpressed."
TwoXChromosomes,ffnobvz,t1_ffnmjmc,1580068500.0,"She does have some emotional problems, but I honestly don't think that's the issue here. I think a much bigger part of it is that she just does not track her surroundings at all. She can interact with something ten times in a day and still have no idea where it is. If she's preoccupied with one thing, she shuts out *everything* else. I do not understand it at all. Both of her parents do the same thing. I catch her dad sometimes, trying to solve problems in ways that take thrice as much effort, because he has decided they are somehow faster or easier. We had to move a car ten feet once and instead of just pushing the thing, he insisted we hook it up to his four wheeler and pull it into place. Stuff like that."
science,ffnnmg0,t1_ffnmker,1580068212.0,"This comment is needlessly dismissive of my perspective and experiences. The bonds will form if you engage with people that foster such things.

science,ffnmvxo,t1_ffnm48o,1580068036.0,I am not the soil in that simile. The bond requires a compatible person. That person is the soil.
