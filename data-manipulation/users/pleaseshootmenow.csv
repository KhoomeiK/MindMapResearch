Why aren‚Äôt you learning to really cook? I thought you were going to be an artist?‚Äù would motivate me in a way that nobody else could."

news,fegkttf,t1_fefsloa,1579095876.0,This thread is one of the saddest I‚Äôve seen on reddit. And when everyone is relating to the same hopeless sentiment in the comments it makes me feel hopeless too. I hope it isn‚Äôt stupid to try and stay positive. It feels unnatural though.

depression,feest4u,t1_fedxfd2,1579040450.0,The reading thing resonated with me. I‚Äôve definitely improved with that so just know you can overcome that. It‚Äôs freaky how depression makes you feel stupid when it gets in the way of taking in the world.
