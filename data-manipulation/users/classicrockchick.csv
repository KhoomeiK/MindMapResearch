They can disagree with Trump, be insulted by him and made to look like fools and they just take it. He's threatening their autonomy and authority as Senators to shape and mold this country legislatively and they're just giving it to him.

The Republicans of the past were assholes for sure, but at least they were arrogant and power greedy enough to say fuck you to the president when they wanted to."

I mean, it's clear our control mechanisms have broken down. Up until this point, so much of the President's behavior has been controlled by the social mores of the office. And as with everything in Trump's entire life, both professional and personal, if he's not going to be immediately arrested for it, then he's going to do it. 

The only thing that's going to stop him is sustained, direct action. Massive sustained protests where the ONLY demand is Trump's removal from office. Until we have that, all these breathless articles of ""Trump did X"" and ""This organization or office found Trump violated rule Y"" are fucking useless. And I'm sick of fucking reading them."
