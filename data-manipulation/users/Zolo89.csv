AskReddit,fdyjae7,t1_fdyhhfn,1578780395.0,"Yeah. Also, CD players were big then too. I remember downloading mp3s from Kazaa and having to burn them via a CD burner and it was limited on how many songs you could burn by data and physical sound on the individual CD. I actually got into alternative music (house in 2007 and lofi hip hop three or four years ago) because of early streaming and YouTube. I still download songs from YouTube but it's usually either lofi-Hip Hop / R&B / house but the majority of the time these three genres I listen to are usually independent artists. Also, the advancement of technology has a downside because of porn (which I was exposed to in 03-04) being instant and other things and also people used to talk more physically instead of being on FB."

Advice,fdk6y8n,t1_fdj0kfe,1578497483.0," The thing is that my current college is shit socially and support wise.  It's good in academics but other students are reluctant to talk to you and I couldn't go to clubs to socialize with other students because my free tutoring was during free time. I want to also do programming and may just self teach myself the math (especially the word problem parts that make the math harder. I also did all of the non-STEM required classes if I were to drop out or not attend this upcoming semester I  would only have less than two years because the policy is that once you're out longer than two years the school considers you a new student which would mean I would most likely have to take all of the required classes like College Writing (1/2), US history, government, drawing,  fiction, etc...

Piracy,fciwn66,t3_egvq9b,1577671589.0,To get rare things like music/audio from The Monroe Institute like a past life regression CD set I got through torrent or if a song is available on YouTube being able to get it through youtube to mp3 (I grew up with programs like Kazza and Morpheus / BearShare / Limewire / Shareaza) also watching movies (sometimes movies from the 2000s like Kiss of The Dragon or The Matrix).

It's also suicide to stop taking them cold turkey because of the negative effects. I don't pay for them out of pocket but through my state insurance.

I also didn't organize my studying. I also tried a program (which I won't name because of it being considered spam) that guaranteed all A's or they'll give one $100 (I have at least 6 copies of the physical book). I also could have sat in an earlier class and did three classes back to back on M/W because I had to take a relative's child to school (this relative is a single mother). I'll post more details if I get a response.

ApplyingToCollege,fdyqh9x,t1_fdypi58,1578782509.0,In high school I took Algebra 1/2 and Geometry. In college I took basic math / pre-algebra and Algebra 1 (currently my third time).
AskReddit,fdyjae7,t1_fdyhhfn,1578780395.0,"Yeah. Also, CD players were big then too. I remember downloading mp3s from Kazaa and having to burn them via a CD burner and it was limited on how many songs you could burn by data and physical sound on the individual CD. I actually got into alternative music (house in 2007 and lofi hip hop three or four years ago) because of early streaming and YouTube. I still download songs from YouTube but it's usually either lofi-Hip Hop / R&B / house but the majority of the time these three genres I listen to are usually independent artists. Also, the advancement of technology has a downside because of porn (which I was exposed to in 03-04) being instant and other things and also people used to talk more physically instead of being on FB."
AskReddit,fdyhepp,t1_fdxgt8g,1578779816.0,I also remember the mp3 player phenomenon it didn't last for even 10 years.
AskReddit,fdyhbjs,t1_fdxijpr,1578779783.0,I grew up in the late 90s to 00s. I'm currently typing on a computer back from 09 but today there's technology like instant download of mp3s (via YouTube to mp3) when back then you had to use a program like Morphus/Kazaa/BearShare/Shareaza/Earthstation 5 etc... And also instant streaming of movies via legal or bootleg streaming.

Thanks."

I found and downloaded a crack but am just scared to use it because it may mess up my PC."
Piracy,fdwaxxn,t1_fdw7u7o,1578756885.0,I just wanted to know if there was a keygen version of the software? I'm going to buy it but don't have access to a credit card. I also wanted to know if there's an alternative software like Cold Turkey? The reason I'm asking is that I'm using the basic version (legally) and it's very good. Thanks.
Subliminal,fdw9oei,t1_fdw5epv,1578756497.0,"What would you recommend to do to speed up the lding experience process? The reason I'm asking is that I may try an audio + visual subliminal but will have to do the visual + audio before I go to sleep. These are the videos I'm considering. Thanks.

Subliminal,fdw26so,t1_fdvz80f,1578754227.0,Is the theta realms channel subliminal? Or is a just a binaural? I tried it last night and couldn't go back to sleep probably because of excitement. I'm trying to use the obe4u technique. Thanks.
learnprogramming,fdvxwfy,t1_fdtaxb0,1578753004.0,I did thanks. Also will the email let me know ahead of time when you'll be having the AMA video?
learnprogramming,fdt3ze3,t3_emz886,1578711614.0,I want advice on how to get started with making things like game system emulators/windows apps (windows 10) smartphone apps and website programming? I am going to switch my major to general ed from an EE major because I'm struggling with an algebra 1 remedial class that's mostly word problem-based. I also wanted to know why a lot of sites for languages like C++ / Javascript / Python etc... that have tutorials for them require math like scientific notation etc...? These are all from my experiences/points of view. Thanks.
Subliminal,fdrsgr0,t1_fdrdn69,1578688970.0,Also do you (or anyone else) know any similar channels? The recommended channel has a lot. Thanks.
Subliminal,fdroygb,t1_fdrdn69,1578687614.0,I'll look into it. Thanks.
Subliminal,fdqw6fs,t1_fdqvbat,1578675664.0,That's alright. The lucid dreaming subliminal should last till then. The reason I started this thread was that I got lucid dreams with a technique from a site called obe4u back in 2014. Thanks.
Subliminal,fdqu32s,t1_fdqin7k,1578674896.0,Could you also let me know if you could make the reverse engineering (computer programming) subliminal? You don't have to make if just let me know if you will release it via DM or this thread. Thanks.

Advice,fdk6y8n,t1_fdj0kfe,1578497483.0," The thing is that my current college is shit socially and support wise.  It's good in academics but other students are reluctant to talk to you and I couldn't go to clubs to socialize with other students because my free tutoring was during free time. I want to also do programming and may just self teach myself the math (especially the word problem parts that make the math harder. I also did all of the non-STEM required classes if I were to drop out or not attend this upcoming semester I  would only have less than two years because the policy is that once you're out longer than two years the school considers you a new student which would mean I would most likely have to take all of the required classes like College Writing (1/2), US history, government, drawing,  fiction, etc... Thanks."

Advice,fd5z9ih,t3_ek2p6d,1578183383.0,"Thanks for the replies. I'm more of a reader than a video watcher (especially print vs ebook/internet) and that was the reason I asked for specific websites. If anyone wants to recommend any URLs other than facebook please do. Thanks.

Edit: I also want simple recipe search engine suggestions.

This is the reason I want to try no oil.

Piracy,fciwn66,t3_egvq9b,1577671589.0,To get rare things like music/audio from The Monroe Institute like a past life regression CD set I got through torrent or if a song is available on YouTube being able to get it through youtube to mp3 (I grew up with programs like Kazza and Morpheus / BearShare / Limewire / Shareaza) also watching movies (sometimes movies from the 2000s like Kiss of The Dragon or The Matrix). Also probably being able to stream shows/movies from other countries (outside the US) and especially YouTube and Live365 (a station named house music 101) that got me mostly into non-mainstream music.

Advice,fc3sxtp,t1_fc3n09v,1577397819.0,I have a fear that if I tell the doctor I'm not taking the correct dose that they won't supply me with them anymore. It's also suicide to stop taking them cold turkey because of the negative effects. I don't pay for them out of pocket but through my state insurance. I really want to get a holistic psychiatrist but can't afford it.
