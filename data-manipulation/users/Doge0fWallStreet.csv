college,fcy4i53,t1_fcxrncj,1578074633.0,"So I double-checked the syllabus. Nothing on there indicates that +/- grading will not be used. Despite being a marketing class, it was very technical. Around 70% of the class had their laptops open and we used iclicker via mobile phones for quizzes. I personally do not think the professor could accurately memorize every student and how many times each one asked a question or not. At least, I never saw her write down anything when a student asks a question. Although I asked only one question, I answered quite a few questions. Questions in the class were more for something we were curious about, rather than completing an assignment. I was not that curious and everything seemed self-explanatory, so I did not bother asking many questions.

Anyway, you make some good points. I have asked the professor a question regarding the subgrades."
college,fcy48g4,t1_fcxyclo,1578074486.0,"It should be perfect. But the professor made us use the iclicker to take attendance, so everyone had around a 78% attendance at best since we used the iclicker after 2 weeks in. I think it's also because she is a fairly new professor. She irked on due dates too, she put due dates at noon for two assignments. But she said she meant midnight. 

Not sure how lenient she is with the grades. My argument is that 83% is a B, nothing in the syllabus indicates a 83% is a B-. The grading system indicates that +/- will not be used and at least 80% would be a B"

csuf,fcfpt8q,t3_eh498h,1577632595.0,"This is self-explanatory, but it largely depends on where your internship is. 

You should probably take your time when deciding on where to intern. Everyone seems nice from the first impression, but if it seems like they are wasting your time or if you are not learning enough practical information, then you should find another internship ASAP. I did not realize the discrepancy in internships until I got my second one. I would apply to around 100 positions within a week and see who contacts you. 

* I mainly joined for the promise of ""remote"" work for my first internship. Bastards bait-and-switch me. The job description did not fit what I was actually doing cause my supervisor quit. So I had four different supervisors. Also no remote work after my main supervisor quit. I barely did jack shit this internship, but it might've been a good time to do a pointless internship that semester because I had homework/projects nonstop from my other classes. (Or maybe I'm just trying to make myself feel less bad for taking such a stupidass internship.)
* My second internship seems much more laid-back. This time, I have a supervisor that actually gives a shit about me. He's an accomplished journalist that actually makes time for me and promises an employee position if I continue to produce good results. 

As for the coursework at school. The internship class just wanted some self-assessment and paperwork to indicate you're not bullshitting the internship. You just write some short reflection essays (I only wrote 2) and send pictures that you were there. You email them your sign-in sheet at the end of your term. I would personally just bs the hours or stretch out the time you were there. For example, if you got out at 5:15 PM, You should put 6:00 PM; you should probably do this if your position is unpaid or if you feel like you are wasting your time there. 

I think you need to find an internship around 1-2 weeks in? My internship had due dates for going in to have your resume checked or for the self-assessment essays. 

If you seek for an unpaid internship and they contact you, it seems guaranteed that you'll get the position.

You would need the class to graduate. But there are circumstances in which one can waive the internship courses. My cousin didn't go to CSUF, he went to another Cal State. He made excuses as to why he couldn't do an internship and he got it waived off."

Anyway, we all make mistakes and I'm sure you'll be able to make friends at a sorority or any other club. I'd rather not commit to a sorority, so I found a different club that fits with my schedule at my university. I think you can search for any other clubs that are more aligned with your interest or schedule."

csuf,fcfpt8q,t3_eh498h,1577632595.0,"This is self-explanatory, but it largely depends on where your internship is. 

You should probably take your time when deciding on where to intern. Everyone seems nice from the first impression, but if it seems like they are wasting your time or if you are not learning enough practical information, then you should find another internship ASAP. I did not realize the discrepancy in internships until I got my second one. I would apply to around 100 positions within a week and see who contacts you. 

* I mainly joined for the promise of ""remote"" work for my first internship. Bastards bait-and-switch me. The job description did not fit what I was actually doing cause my supervisor quit. So I had four different supervisors. Also no remote work after my main supervisor quit. I barely did jack shit this internship, but it might've been a good time to do a pointless internship that semester because I had homework/projects nonstop from my other classes. (Or maybe I'm just trying to make myself feel less bad for taking such a stupidass internship.)
* My second internship seems much more laid-back. This time, I have a supervisor that actually gives a shit about me. He's an accomplished journalist that actually makes time for me and promises an employee position if I continue to produce good results. 

As for the coursework at school. The internship class just wanted some self-assessment and paperwork to indicate you're not bullshitting the internship. You just write some short reflection essays (I only wrote 2) and send pictures that you were there. You email them your sign-in sheet at the end of your term. I would personally just bs the hours or stretch out the time you were there. For example, if you got out at 5:15 PM, You should put 6:00 PM; you should probably do this if your position is unpaid or if you feel like you are wasting your time there. 

I think you need to find an internship around 1-2 weeks in? My internship had due dates for going in to have your resume checked or for the self-assessment essays. 

If you seek for an unpaid internship and they contact you, it seems guaranteed that you'll get the position.

You would need the class to graduate. But there are circumstances in which one can waive the internship courses. My cousin didn't go to CSUF, he went to another Cal State. He made excuses as to why he couldn't do an internship and he got it waived off."

I'm not really sure about the context behind everything that led to your cheating, but that doesn't matter anymore. Life goes on, thinking about regrets isn't going to get you anywhere. 

Anyway, we all make mistakes and I'm sure you'll be able to make friends at a sorority or any other club. I'd rather not commit to a sorority, so I found a different club that fits with my schedule at my university. I think you can search for any other clubs that are more aligned with your interest or schedule."
