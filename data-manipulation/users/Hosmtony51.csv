For the lighter pens (yellow heart, Padauk, Sapele) I apply just Danish Oil with 16 coats of thin with accelerator.  Sand and buff and have not had an issue since."

woodworking,fe0n5ha,t1_fe0ln68,1578816369.0,This comes from South America.  Brosimum rubescens is the name per the Wood Database.   The Australian version is Red Bloodwood.  Your version appears to have the same Janka hardness as Purpleheart which is around 2500.  This Bloodwood is at 2900.  It is so hard.  Doing the inlay was sketchy because my router bit fought me tooth and nail.

woodworking,fcwmacv,t1_fcwm1mm,1578029636.0,Nope.  My knuckles are the hairy ones.
woodworking,fcwm8fq,t1_fcwlk04,1578029588.0,"There are several ways from what I’ve seen.  I just chucked up a piece of 1.5 x 1.5 blank.   I then found out which Forster bit was closest to our fingers sizes and then drill out the center about 1/2”.  Then I put the support spindle on for support while it shaped it down.  Using the round mini cutter and diamond cutter, I got it down to where I was happy with it then I would sand it inside and out from 150-600.  Finally I would cut it off with the diamond cutter and sand that side to match the other.  I then applied danish oil.   Applying CA is tricky and I need to practice that better.  I have a taper jig made of scrape dowel rod I made to hold the ring but it’s hard to apply without gluing the ring to the jig."
