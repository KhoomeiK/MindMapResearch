MLS,ffisieb,t1_ffir6ca,1579981612.0,My point is this article and tweet is meaningless currently. It has no specifics outside of January camp and qualifying isn't until March. So unless let players are missing then it is a fluff piece.
MLS,ffipq8e,t1_ffip1s2,1579979649.0,"To the second point, it was to point out that the title has no relevance at all.

The article mention Pulisic and McKennie both are players that play with the senior team. So not sure what the deal is.

Last time the U23 made the Olympics was 2012 and they didn't do well. We straight up didn't qualify for 2016. Do you not think the Olympics is important to the growth and development of US soccer, and/or that franchises should withhold that experience from these younger player."
