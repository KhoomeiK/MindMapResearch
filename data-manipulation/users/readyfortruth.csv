depression,fdng3d1,t3_elycos,1578585062.0,"It’s so easy for people to say just “cheer up”
or something along those lines.  Depression feels to me like a state of being.  It’s not a choice.  I haven’t taken the time to read the other comments on here but I can relate to your post.   It does feel like there is no point to it.  It feels like it’s rigged somehow.  I’m not sure what to make of it.   If I could make one person feel better it feels like I’m worth something- only to find out that they don’t appreciate It because they’re literally dealing with the same vicious cycle.   I hope your feel better."
depression,f2ego9v,t3_dd2zgf,1570194755.0,"This is a common problem i found.  The solution i developed is to become a better listener and to be a better friend.  A lot of people seek me out for advice and obviously it’s time consuming.  The real connection isn’t really there like i have always hoped it would be.  For the special times I really felt I had an amazing connection- it ultimately led to disappointment.  People can not maintain your happiness.  For me it’s a complete illusion to have a friend I really love and trust.  I feel your pain. 

To love oneself is a real choice.  I hate myself for being this alone.  

Good luck!"
