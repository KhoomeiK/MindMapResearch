Obviously talking about nausea accompanying illness, would never promote bulimia."
YouShouldKnow,fdnxkz4,t1_fdljrjy,1578594895.0,"There is a massive market for collected and accurate information on people of all kinds, the price on such information is priceless but is given one nonetheless, it's something international laws need to be put in place for and they need to be enforced because even though you're shown T&C not everyone will read the language in the way a lawyer will. They should be forced to provide a separate contract by which they make the user sign for the selling and use of their data, but they won't because they know no one would go for it. 

Most of it from what we know is used for marketing research, but what if someone who is the market of selling people buys a bunch of that info on people for a certain area? They'd have their daily itinerary for the week, every week, it'd make things almost too easy. Pretty out there example but human trafficking is still a really bad issue that isn't touched on too much."

Public libraries nowadays are nuts, one in the more rural area of my province rents out bikes too."
AskReddit,fcnh1ty,t3_ehxmpw,1577811546.0,"Playing with gypsy cards is how I put it, I have a deck of Oracle cards, Tarot cards and special playing cards. 

I have a journal filled with the readings I give myself every other week, I generally keep them all hidden, I don't even know why because I know they don't and won't care but I do enjoy using the cards every now again. 

The oracle cards are probably my favorite and the readings can sometimes be a little spooky because half the time I'm like I'm starting to know the cards and know what I should see, and when that card is there I'm taken aback."
