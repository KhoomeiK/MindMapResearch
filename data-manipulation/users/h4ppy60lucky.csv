CPTSD,ffk2mtm,t3_esqlc2,1580013906.0,"I've been no contact with my emotional neglectful & abuse parents for almost two years.

And I just miss my parents. I don't know why it's been harder lately. I have been thinking about then a lot more lately, j think because I'm about to have surgery. And most people have a mom to ehlp care for them.

Which makes me realize I don't miss my parentsz nd I just miss having parents. And I miss the things I could enjoy with them.

Does it ever get easier???"
