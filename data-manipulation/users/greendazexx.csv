JUSTNOMIL,fg04dhv,t1_ffzr3xq,1580399947.0,It’s not his daughter though that’s his sons wife
IdiotsFightingThings,fg03swo,t1_fg03g2x,1580399595.0,"Yeah I used clicking for trot, kisses for canter and saying whoa/ho to drop down a gait. It’s pretty easy to train, just say the word or noise when you cue them to either speed up or slow down and eventually you’ll be able to just just use the verbal command :)"
IdiotsFightingThings,fg01kp7,t1_ffzv3sm,1580398172.0,I trained mine to respond to voice commands for each gait

tippytaps,ffyud1n,t1_ffyu4xv,1580355361.0,Eventually I’ll get around to doing that DNA test on him but it’s expensive lol. If I do I’ll let you know! Do you have a picture of yours?

KneadyCats,ffyk596,t1_ffyjwdp,1580348353.0,"Idk man I wouldn’t have done that to a cat at any age, but tbf I did grow up with cats and parents that emphasized being careful with/nice to animals/pets. Yknow now I am remembering my brother pulling out half our cats whiskers after being told not to so it does depend on the age. Our parents repeatedly told him no and when he did it the last time she smacked him across the face and he never did it again"
MurderedByWords,ffyjwhq,t1_ffyjq1v,1580348186.0,"Sorry, should’ve phrased that better. I am a girl so I guess worked better for me but when I was getting nervous about showing interest in a person I started flirting/complimenting/practicing accepting compliments from my friends where both parties knew there was no romantic interest, and actually to clarify why I said people I did mean both genders, but I can see where that would be not a great idea with guys"
IDontWorkHereLady,ffyd0pu,t1_ffxc0dj,1580343501.0,Maybe do some reading up on that subject as I think you’ve got some incorrect information. (I live in California and recently did a huge project on the sanctuary state proposal for my class)
