At the time of the amendment's ratification, militias were the national defense. There was a fear of the damage that could be done by leaders with standing armies or mercenaries. But, this was not a universal concern. There were considerable disadvantages to lacking a professional military. Some of the founders, notably Washington, argued in favor of a professional army from the beginning. Jefferson and others were opposed. 

However, by the end of Washington's presidency, the debate was largely settled. The need for a professional military was apparent. In 1802, Jefferson signed a version of the NDAA that formally established a professional military, and it's been that way ever since. The notion of militia defending the nation has been dead for over two hundred years."

A man killed in a ground fight? Just because it wasn't our ground power doesn't mean it wasn't ground power. Our air power supported other ground forces which led to his defeat.

My view is that the Army and Navy are fine being separated, since they operate on clearly different surfaces. The transition between those domains is clearly defined and is managed such high levels where the coordination between two services can be performed relatively easily. Because of the new direction that the Marines are taking under their new commandant, I'm fine there as well. 

Really, the Navy is the perfect example of what I want to happen with the Army. The Navy flies ground based, fixed wing aircraft in support of their missions. They integrate into their forces easily, and nobody has an issue with it. I've frequently heard Army officers talk about how the Marines have better air-ground coordination that we do. I always say ""Of course they do. They own their aircraft."""

Air power alone cannot win a war. And yet, the Air Force consistently prioritizes a force structure which serves an operational model that doesn't work. 

That's why we see the cycle of ISR capabilities degrading until they're needed by ground commanders, then being built up to meet the needs, then degrading again in subsequent years. That's why the Air Force has pushed to retire the A-10 without a replacement CAS aircraft, instead making the asinine statement that the F-35 will be a suitable replacement. 

The air force will dominate the air and forget about why they ever did so, and a space force will do the same thing. Dominance in space is useless unless it serves an operational need of surface commanders. Now that surface commanders have been taken out of the loop, you can bet that their requirements will start being ignored.
