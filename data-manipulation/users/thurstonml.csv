personalfinance,ffoqv75,t3_eu7dqe,1580080587.0,"Used car loans will always be higher than new cars. You should have spoken with private lenders instead of going through the dealers preffered lenders. Many of them can get you at the 3.5-4% mark, but the terms will be shorter. Most of the time they will only be 3-4 year terms. I've had the most luck with Capital One Auto, I currently have 2 loans with them; $90,000 for one of them and $45,000 for the other and they are both a tad over 3% for 6 years."

All of those places are worth going, they have better views than the US, cleaner air, lower taxes, and are not socialist.  The process is simple. It will result in me taking millions out of the stock market, millions out of the various banks I work with, ruin security for a couple hundred companies, and lay off the 42 employees I have working for me as well as the contractors.

Why?

I am not giving 80% of my income to the government so that they can incentivize people to not work or contribute to society. I donate to my church for that. They take care of the needy in the community I live in."
nottheonion,fffbxh7,t3_et2qog,1579880579.0,Probably because anyone with wealth will take their money and leave this country if it becomes socialist. That's what I'm going to do. In addition to shutting down my firm.

Something like this happens every day for cops. They wake up every day knowing that they may not come home... knowing that they will have a new scar in their mind... and for what? To have people like this post ridicule them for saving their own lives when they feel that they are in danger?
