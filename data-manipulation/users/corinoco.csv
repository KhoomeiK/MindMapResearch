In this case; will it be built as a complex-curvature structural element (laser cut steel, CNC bending, ie $$$$) or straight segments with a curved external cladding material (welded straight steel segments, curved aluminium cladding, ie $)

Constructablilty is an issue here; ask if the structure is intended to be the final visible element, or if it will be clad.

Straight segments is easier; you'll need workplanes along each beam segment, model line in workplance or beam endpoint heights; all fairly simple, just a little fiddly if lots of segments.

Complex-curved element is a whole different beast; hopefully the arch is using rational (ie, computable) curves and not arbitrary ""designer"" cuvres (ie, nightmare, especially if it came from evil bastard Rhino).

How has the element been modelled by the architect? This willl give you a clue as to how to model it. My gut feeling is model as a generic adpative component; this gives you the greatest control over shapes. Second option is an in-place family. If it's a true spiral element you're starting to head beyond what is possible in Revit (ie, curvature changing as a function rather than linear (planar) changes)

It's not impossible - I'm working on a facade that is a section of an elliptical torus - but it is very strictly mathematically designed, so each element is a 'rational' element with curvature in only one plane and no twist. Each linear element is an adpative family that internally calculates it's cut angle to the next segment.

Twisting spiral forms need at the minimum an in-place or adaptive family using swept blends, you might need to form some conic sections to define the spiral path.

As a last resort - copy/paste the arch elment! If thats the shape they want, then just use it as-is."

Once on Pitcairn they swiftly fell into anarchy, with all but one (John Adams - Adams is another common surname on Norfolk Island) of the mutineers dead by the time their colony was dicovered by the *Topaz*.

Then there's the story of the *Pandora*, sent to find the mutineers and later wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef while trying to bring 13 of the mutineers back to England for justice.

And lastly - I've actually sailed on the *Bounty* and been at her helm; not the real one of course, but one of the replicas built for films in the 1970's. The version of *Bounty* I sailed is now in Singapore, I think; it's not the one that tragically sank in the Bahamas."

Revit,feeyabg,t3_eosebr,1579043868.0,"Great rule of Revit (for me at least) - ***model it the way you would build it.***

In this case; will it be built as a complex-curvature structural element (laser cut steel, CNC bending, ie $$$$) or straight segments with a curved external cladding material (welded straight steel segments, curved aluminium cladding, ie $)

Constructablilty is an issue here; ask if the structure is intended to be the final visible element, or if it will be clad.

Straight segments is easier; you'll need workplanes along each beam segment, model line in workplance or beam endpoint heights; all fairly simple, just a little fiddly if lots of segments.

Complex-curved element is a whole different beast; hopefully the arch is using rational (ie, computable) curves and not arbitrary ""designer"" cuvres (ie, nightmare, especially if it came from evil bastard Rhino).

How has the element been modelled by the architect? This willl give you a clue as to how to model it. My gut feeling is model as a generic adpative component; this gives you the greatest control over shapes. Second option is an in-place family. If it's a true spiral element you're starting to head beyond what is possible in Revit (ie, curvature changing as a function rather than linear (planar) changes)

It's not impossible - I'm working on a facade that is a section of an elliptical torus - but it is very strictly mathematically designed, so each element is a 'rational' element with curvature in only one plane and no twist. Each linear element is an adpative family that internally calculates it's cut angle to the next segment.

Twisting spiral forms need at the minimum an in-place or adaptive family using swept blends, you might need to form some conic sections to define the spiral path.

As a last resort - copy/paste the arch elment! If thats the shape they want, then just use it as-is."
