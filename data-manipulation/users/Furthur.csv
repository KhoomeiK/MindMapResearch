bartenders,ffruafn,t1_ffrt56f,1580165978.0,"couple ways we've handled that in the past. If the morning (10-16) isn't as busy traditionally the AM staff are expected to stock/batch the fuck out of the store so that PM >16:00 doesn't have to do much in order to keep service expedited.

The other factor is fewer wait staff in the AM but likely taking higher volume per person and the bar staff is allowed to pick up tables to compensate.  

We typically divided tip share by shift in most places while tip share in venues substantially biased towards the PM where AM staff did a LARGE amount of prep work we would divide tipshare for the entire day based on an hourly rate for everyone who worked. This is an instance where we had set AM and PM people based on their desire/availability.  Turned out alright!"

Velo,ffk553g,t1_ffk4blr,1580016183.0,"you're right but leaning too heavily on this 100% FTP adaptation thing. The adaptation from this are going to come from cell stress not from rest intervals. I can't think of a reason to do sub-100% intervals and rest in between them. You aren't stressing your endogenous fuel storage, you aren't relying any any anaerobic upregulation of genes to adapt to a hypoxic cell stress situation, it's just going out for a strenuous walk and stopping for as long or longer than you were walking before doing it again. This is something you can literally do all day and eat an apple each time and never jeopardize your glycogen thus never causing the deep cell signalling to adapt. 

FTP is literally MLSS, its the balance point between aerobic and anaerobic work lighting the fuse of your hitting the wall. In labs it's normal to hold this for 90+ minutes just in an every day evaluation. 20min just isn't enough to do anything at that threshold.

The issue is that 20m intertervals at a pace you can likely keep as long as you have BG available isn't something that requires recovery. OP doesn't even need a hill to do this, just pushing watts in a bigger gear. If the exercise is mostly aerobic or even at .85 RER then it's a solid mix of FFA and glycogen which is something that can be supplemented with food/drink.
