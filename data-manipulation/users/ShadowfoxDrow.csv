microdosing,fdncix5,t3_em1ryd,1578582855.0,Also curious about this now.
getdisciplined,fdlvg69,t1_fdlt1ln,1578533434.0,"I like this approach, and I'm hopeful that it gets up and running so I can put it to use! Definitely happy to keep in touch on this (maybe I won't have to make my own app after all!)

Edit: Do you have an eta on an android version?"
getdisciplined,fdldvij,t1_fdlcasn,1578521921.0,"Incentive and investment is huge. This is a good post.

Also congrats on kicking the weed!"
getdisciplined,fdku3o2,t1_fdkt3k9,1578511186.0,"Right, but that button pressing is supposed to represent you doing something else you're trying to build, and usually many something elses. So either you do those things and are honest about the button pressing, or you aren't honest about the button pressing just to press the button.

But yes you gotta start somewhere."
getdisciplined,fdkoeo6,t1_fdko1qm,1578507793.0,"You're not wrong!

The question of how to build discipline without discipline is so hard to answer. I haven't found it (hence why I'm here in this sub!), but it doesn't mean that we can't keep asking the question and hoping someone can help us get closer to the answer."

getdisciplined,fdklchj,t1_fdkkw24,1578505931.0,"Maybe look at trying to break the habit of defaulting and to other apps first? Or try to frame the personal growth as another form of studying? There's no test to pass, but each time you succeed at the thing you want is like passing a quiz."
getdisciplined,fdkk047,t1_fdkjn3g,1578505243.0,"I used IFTT to a similar effect. I struggled to get up for an 8am class and set a trigger to post that I slept through my class on Facebook if I didn't turn it off. It worked for about a week until it posted once. I got shit on by my friends but given that I was already known to sleep through early morning things it became more of a joke than a serious consequence, and then I stopped doing it when I was sleeping through more than I was going."
