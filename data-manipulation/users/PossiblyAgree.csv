AskReddit,ferp2tk,t1_ferkq40,1579356721.0,This is a legit concern for me. How many reminders for reminders can you set?
AskReddit,fero87r,t1_fero28r,1579356413.0,This is probably why you aren't that forgetful. I'd probably just forget the number

AskReddit,ferkqv6,t1_ferk24w,1579355164.0,I always do this. I say it out loud. My friends remind me when I forget to recite and check everything.
bulletjournal,fe0qvn5,t1_fe0i19z,1578817625.0,Haha yeah! I accidentally gave February a 6 day week and March has two 26ths.

AskReddit,fd8ojjy,t3_ek7l30,1578220969.0,Toothpicks. Loads and loads of toothpicks.
CleaningTips,fd5xs39,t1_fd5wsie,1578182845.0,That sounds oddly terrifying. Is it something you need to be careful with when it comes to your skin?
CleaningTips,fd5urs9,t1_fd5j2rf,1578181752.0,"I am from Belgium, but most of the products you named, I do recognize, so I'll probably be able to find them. 
We have a swiffer at home and honestly I love it so I am excited to try the microfibre clothes, if those work even better. Honestly a lifesaver for someone with pets who absolutely hates vacuuming haha.
Thank you very much for the tips!"
CleaningTips,fd4kpgd,t1_fd44ee0,1578168457.0,"I don't think  we have Kroger where I live, but I will keep my eyes open. I think I might know where to get them."
CleaningTips,fd4kfix,t1_fd39jvb,1578168325.0,I will definitely try this! The amount of hair that comes from our cats amazes me. I don't understand how they have any left.
CleaningTips,fd3q1n0,t1_fd3pbk2,1578160684.0,"Oh nice, I'd love to try that!"
bulletjournal,fd3nhlu,t1_fd3n74n,1578159993.0,"Thank you so much, I was looking into getting one myself and I love how they look in your bujo!"
CleaningTips,fd3mlgj,t1_fd3male,1578159792.0,Oh I don't think I've ever used stainless steel wipes. What exactly do you use them for?
bulletjournal,fd3faqq,t3_ejxg9x,1578157724.0,I've been seeing more of these and I absolutely love them! What gold pen do you use for this?
findapath,fd395vp,t3_ejqdgi,1578155914.0,I'd absolutely be down if you still have room and are not too far out of my time zone!
CleaningTips,fd30v8x,t1_fd2yyn2,1578153711.0,"Oh wow thank you so much for all this info! My cat hates being brushed unfortunately. He does not mind his head and back but I can't touch his belly and tail, which are of course the worst parts. We recently bought a type of glove with brush pins on it and this seems to help but cat hair is definitely an issue haha.

We mostly use rubber gloves as you suggest. So much even that the tips of the fingers now have holes in them. Definitely something I need to buy for myself!

I am from Europe so I will look into the versions we have here, but thank you so much for taking your time to write this!"
CleaningTips,fd2v7hx,t1_fd2th0z,1578151922.0,Thank you so much! I do have quite a few on your list already but it seems like I have a few more shopping trips to do haha!
CleaningTips,fd2v325,t1_fd2ti5i,1578151878.0,I've seen this come up a lot in posts on this sub. Is this also available in Europe?
