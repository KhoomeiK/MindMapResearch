WHAT? Not only did you not give a heads up or ask him first, clear it with her, you then said you hope their marriage fails. That's not only being TA to her, but to him. Even if you dont like her, he does, and that's all that really mattered in that scenario. And now your own engagement, what should have been a happy moment for everyone, will forever be tarnished by this moment. Because not only will SIL remember it, your brother will remember it as the day you wished doom upon his marriage and disrespected the woman he loves, you will remember it as the day that caused strife within your family, and your poor fiance, the innocent bystander, has to remember this as the day where she came between you and your brother, just with your presence, and that your love has cost you your own family. This is already seen as a big wedding no no, but then your follow up made it so much worse."

The thing about abuse is, as someone who has been in multiple abusive relationships, we become so broken and dependent that we dont see what someone is doing as bad to us. It becomes the pain that we are comfortable with. When we know someone is going to 180 on us, its predictable, and acceptable. You are newer, and still the unknown factor. The best you can do is say ""I really care about you. And your supposed friendship with this guy has caused you to come home crying repeatedly. I hate seeing that. And it makes me hate him more, and trust him less. Why would I want you to be friends with someone I know is going to send you back to me in tears? He hasn't shown to me that he cares enough to expect your boundaries, wishes, or our relationship. He isn't a friend. If you need to keep civil for rowing  that's fine. But I dont want him to be part of OUR life together. His toxicity will just spread. I'm not okay with how he treats you, and I can't support that friendship. But you have to make your own choices. I'm not giving you an ultimatum in the short term. But in the long term, I'm not sure I could sit by and watch you do this to yourself, while he actively tries to destroy our relationship. So I hope you choose us. Because you are so important and precious to me. I honestly can't fathom why he would want to treat you like that, and make you cry, when I just want to hold you and make all the pain go away. If there is something I can do to help you get out of this situation with him, to deal with what he has put you through, of course I will do whatever I can. But you have to want me to. ""

Because that's the reality here. She has to want help. You can't force her to be saved or see the toxicity. 

I have been in multiple abusive relationships. With guys who also wouldn't take no for answer. So if you, or her, need to talk to someone who has been there, also refused to accept that someone was bad for me, and has dug there way out, but is still in therapy... hit my DMs. Lol.

relationship_advice,ffb1hap,t3_es8jy7,1579749438.0,"I had a similar experience that some people mentioned up top. 23F. I was raped multiple times. 2 different guys. And I literally hated sex because of it. Until I had just turned 22. I happened to meet the love of my life. We had sex. And I wasn't expecting much. Honestly, it was the most liberating and beautiful experience of my life. Now we fuck like bunnies and I love sex. I cannot get enough of him. Now that's not the same for everyone. And occasionally I have spontaneous flashbacks and burst into tears randomly. But there is nothing more comforting than being that close to someone I know I can trust. 

Tell her the truth. You are surprised and shaken by this knowledge, and want to make sure that sex is an enjoyable experience in a safe space for her. Ask her if going forward there is anything that you can do differently or should stop doing or start doing to make her feel comfortable. But when you bring this up, try to catch her at a level moment. Dont get her as she is getting ready, drinking coffee before leaving for work. Thinking about it can leave a little stain in your mood or on your day. Catch her on a night you guys are in. So if either of you get emotional, you can just cuddle all night.

You are genuinely so sweet and she is very lucky to have you.

Edit: Also! If she is still in therapy, and this becomes an issue for you, most therapist, even if they arent couples therapists, will do 1 or 2 sessions with a partner or group if it serves the interest of their patient. And all therapists are trained in communication. So if there is a communication issue or misunderstandings arise, or you just in fact cannot get past this, ask to go to a session or two with her. The therapist can point you in the right direction, guide conversation, and give you guys some exercises to work through this."

AmItheAsshole,ff85sxw,t3_ervv4n,1579666791.0,"NTA. But is there a middle ground we can hit? Like your husband said, for a possibility of repairing the relationship he needs the chance  to. 

Also keeping in mind, many colleges dont LET students stay year round. They close down most of the dorms and food services, go to minimal staffing. And have a few weeks where everyone is required to leave so they can rush through  and sanitize everything. So where should he go? Back with his mom so she can keep poisoning his mind? Impose on a friend? Couch surf? By the time he gets to junior year he'll  be looking at getting an on campus apartment instead of dorms and then he can just stay there. 

At this point if you say he can't return, you will damage your relationship  with your husband, and the kid will see it as a personal attack and then forget any chance of building a relationship  there. 

Sit down with your husband and point out your concerns, that you hate feeling attacked and like a victim in your own house, and him coming back gives you severe anxiety. And then lay down ground rules. Really simple things. Staying civil. Keeping things respectful. He can't go into your room at all (that becomes your safe space). And he has to clean up after himself. You can even say he needs to contribute to the house. He can help his dad with a home improvement project, or cut grass. And if he has nothing nice to say, he should go with saying nothing. Telm your husband that you are not okay with the sons past behavior, so if he wants to bring him back, then he needs to take responsibility for maintaining the peace. That puts the ball in his court for dealing with the kids behavior. And even if he is 19, if he lives in your house, he plays by yalls rules. 

When he gets there, remain civil, dont push for a relationship or apologies or anything. Think co workers. Distant yet polite. If he wants to build a relationship  with you, he needs to take those steps. He obviously doesn't want you to. 

When he starts to say something rude to you, dont fight, dont get upset, simply stand up, and leave the room. Go to your room and read a book. Leave it to your husband to deal with. And feel free to tell your husband that you dont feel he responded strongly enough after a situation arises. Even if that is his son, you are his wife. And he is responsible for showing his kid not only how to treat a lady or significant other, but how to stick up for your spouse."

And sunday you forgot to take the trash out. Do I keep asking you to do stuff? Why would I keep relying on you, or counting on you to do be there for me?"
AmItheButtface,fens07b,t3_eq18l8,1579289950.0,"NTB. A promise is a promise. Its straightforward  a simple. Unless something dramatic happened, family emergency, everything at work went to shit and they forced him to stay late to fix something, a friend had a tragedy and needed help.... But barring big explosive drama, if you promise someone you will be there for them or do something for them, you just do it, or your word means shit. Like, that's it. His actions are saying game time with my friends is more important than the quality time I promised you. Now if he feels he needs more separation, more personal space, okay, but then he needs to verbalize that need. Breaking promises is not how to Express needs. It's how you get fucking dumped. Honestly, I wouldn't keep tolerating that. It doesn't magically get better one day. And the fact that you SAID to him hey this is bothering me and I'm totally triggered, and then he just turned around and starting gaslighting you and complaining about the comparison? Like, yeah, that comparison can hurt. Maybe it's taking things to an extreme. But he didnt even care enough to listen and have serious conversation  about an action he is doing that is causing you pain. 

As a PTSD gal myself, I can tell you, it massively warps our ideas of what is okay and acceptable in relationships. And we feel unworthy, so when someone expresses a love for us, we fall into it so hard. But it's so easy for that to not be real. We fool ourselves. I just kept falling love and taking in abusive manipulative boyfriend after another. It took me so long to realize what I was doing. Someone said love and I said yes. Then they would rape me and I would say they didnt mean it and blame myself. Yeah. That's a little extreme. I know. But that's what PTSD CAN do to us. We can become so unknowingly desperate for affection. I always thought I was a standoffish loner. 

So I want you to think really hard. What are the qualities that this person has, that you want to keep with you forever? And are they sincere and qualities attached to this person? Or are they just normal things, and you arent used to being treated like a worthwhile human after your experiences? 

I had to really think about this. I was engaged. After a mess of events, where he did nothing wrong, besides not taking out the trash, I realized I didnt love this person at all, but I had attached myself to him because he was safe. He hadn't raped me. He had never manipulated me. He was sincere and honest with me. And he was nice and funny. But those arent reasons to love someone. That's all basic human decency! I had just never experienced it in relationship before. I was so broken, I thought simple humanity was this magical love thing. 

We mutually broke off the engagement. And I ended up finding the real love of my life. For real this time. Lots of therapy. Lots of trials of our commitment to each other. Standing strong. 

Hit me up if you need to chat. Hang in there. You are a survivor. You are stronger than think."

She has some demons to work out on her own. Find a friend to confide in, and then do what you gotta to move on. And get yourself into counseling. Since your 20, maybe your in college, they have free or cheap counselors. And I'm not saying that because you need help moving on. You need help learning how to define a healthy relationship with good communication skills. Because that ain't fucking it. Your EX gf is a child and not ready for a grown up relationship.  And if this is a regular thing, it's manipulation and abuse. What you should do is if she unblocks  you and tries to make contact, is ignore it and block her. Please get help OP. This isn't love. This is an emotional danger zone."

That's an assumption  on that guys part. Lots of people take birth control for non sex reasons. 
Also, it's massively rude of him to ask about the drugs you are taking. That's an extremely personal thing. Your medical history, needs, whatever, are none of his business. If he asked, oh are you feeling okay, do you need something, I saw you take a pill. That would be one thing. But to ask are you taking something? Nope. Super rude. I would have said yes and left it. And if he asked what I would have told him it's absolutely none of his business. Generally I have zero problems telling people about my medical needs. But when they are that nosey and confrontational, nah, fuck off, mind your business. 
You did nothing wrong. He is a nosey, misogynistic, uninformed, prick."

Just send her a message and be like hey are you still a thing, because I saw your post but I was under the impression he was dating me. And then see what explosion does or doesn't occur."
