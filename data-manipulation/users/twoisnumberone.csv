Your best predictor of BMI in the US is zip code. 

Poor people are fat. They have no money or time for a gym; they are discriminated against for a variety of class and race reasons; they are NOT just “too lazy to go to the gym”.

As a techie I live in one of those suburbs with 2 m houses. Muscular and athletic and normal weight; I work out at the gym — it’s provided by my tech company and furthered by leadership. My time is flexible. I need only one income and can save a bunch of money each month. I have stock options. 

This is NOT what poor people’s life is like at all. Fat acceptance is life and live and love acceptance only."

Totally a capitalist mechanism, yeah, but one that has genuine benefits if you time it right.

E.g. I don't do breakfast because lol getting up early no thx; I do stay for dinner though, because in the US good food is expensive and real full meals take time. Overall it's not like I work longer hours; they're just shifted. 

Some of those accountants always come in super-early and always talk about how good the breakfast was; they leave early too, though.

That said, the first game, PoE1 needs three big pointers: 1. If you don't like vicarious embarrassment because it's Kickstarter-backed, avoid gold-plated NPCs and tombstones. I at least cringed a lot by the (admittedly small) elements the backers were allowed to add to the game. 2. Difficulty varies greatly even within areas and Acts, so save often and tread carefully. 3. Act I is VERY DARK and quite long; the game lightens up after, though, if always thematically weighty."

Now I plan to run, for the first time ever, a warrior, but I'm already angsting over not being able to take Cass if I do Templar, and not being able to take Bull if I make a two-handed dwarven lady (totally looking forward to her in any case).

Generally, though, as a Warden you can't escape death by the Blight -- either you die at the hands of blighted creatures, darkspawn; or you become one of them and perish from that. The Calling generally pulls you into the Deep Roads, but I suppose one could run a Werewolf Solution (tm) on a Warden and simply lock them up so they cannot physically follow the Calling.
