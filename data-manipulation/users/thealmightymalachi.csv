If you want a plain Amanglish accent, watch broadcast TV news and use the same word tone, inflections and accents they do. Repeat their words, flattening the vowels and sharpening the consonants.

If you want to fit closer to Canadian English, listen to Canadian English speakers and pattern it.

You could easily watch Rocky Borrow Picture Show and become a high London Road accent just by listening to Tim Curry.

The only reason you have an accent is because you choose to speak that way. If an English actor can flatten their accent to play an American (Liam Neeson) you can sharpen yours to be Middle Amanglic."

Truthfully I don't know how authentic it is in flavor; I don't try to duplicate anything, but rather make it as tasty as I possibly can for what I'm making.

My general theory is that you go out to eat at places where the food is special not just for the food, but for the experience. My daughter and I love to go to a pinball arcade and ice cream joint, and while the ice cream is good it's not just the ice cream we love.

So even though I could probably make it as traditional as possible, I prefer to keep it **ramenesque**. Partially because it's easier that way, but also because when we go out to eat at an actual ramen house the flavors will be different."

I am writing to you with grave concern for your child, Familiar.

It seems as if Familiar is unable to keep up with their studies in Troll Kindergarten. From incidences where Familiar eats the copypasta instead of spreading it around, to learning how to use proper troll language, even down to being unable to comprehend basic language or skillsets that make for successful trolling, Familiar is simply unable to keep up with the other trolls in the class.

As you know, remedial troll studies is a class designed to help the troll children who are unable to advance in their abilities. There is no shame in enrolling Familiar in remedial troll studies, and it may even help him, as there are specialists in the classroom who are well-versed in removing crayons from the average troll child's nostril before they strike the brain cavity.

I understand that this may be a disappointment to you, as your older troll children have gone on to have successful trolling careers. However, I truly feel that Familiar would do far better in a lower pace environment with a focus on basic skillbuilding.

I look forward to discussing your child's capabilities and future with you, but we cannot keep Familiar in the regular troll kindergarten any longer, as their inability to progress is impacting the rest of the class.

Best regards,

Ms. Under DeBridge."

I have concerns about the chicken and egg industry - specifically regarding the destruction of all male chicks by live maceration as a byproduct of the industry.

It's not a difficult jump to go from ""it's wrong to grind up unwanted male baby chickens alive"" to ""it's wrong to keep chickens in battery farm cages"" to ""I don't eat chicken or eggs"". 

It is, however, interesting (from an external point of view, looking at my own personal ethics) that becoming aware of what is done with the unwanted male chicks when new chickens are hatched is what sparked my ethical consideration, and not the other myriad concerns of how the animals are treated in a battery farm environment.

In other words, I find it passing strange that my knowledge of how the baby chicks are killed is what made me ethically uncomfortable with the whole process. Not that the female chickens are raised only for nine months before being killed, or that the living conditions for egg laying chickens are incredibly unhealthy.

No, the realization that the unwanted baby male chicks are essentially ground up alive (or gassed en masse) because the chicken and egg industry is TOO FUCKING LAZY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RAISE THEM FOR MEAT is what pushed me to say ""Hold up, do I really want to be a participant in this industry?""

A vegetarian friend of mine (who is vegetarian because she doesn't enjoy the taste of meat) when she was pregnant, looked at exactly what she needed to eat to get a certain amount of protein and amino acids in her diet. 

What it came down to after she did the math was that she could either eat half a kilo of meat a week or roughly thirty times that in other vegetarian foodstuffs to get the right amount of nutrients.

So she went off her vegetarian diet for nine months and saved around $300 a month in food bills that she would have had to spend in supplements to get the same amount of nutrients she needed.

The point is that you CAN get everything the body needs from alternative sources of food, but it's not always fiscally feasible. Fifty years ago, access to tropical foods was significantly higher than what it is now but even then the sheer variety of food we have available in the stores is stunning compared to what our grandparents had access to.

He is, in fact, the guy who is the subject of the post.

His entire political history as a political consultant is as effective as the Yugo engineering team was in developing a cost-efficient mass market vehicle salable to the United States, and for many of the same reasons.

For fuck's sake, his candidate beat Liebermann. LIEBERMANN. And then Liebermann ran as an independent and beat his ass bluer than an ahi sushi steak.

And now he's working as Bernie's primary political guy on social media and flopping every day.

It's cute that you're trying to denigrate and bypass the resume of the guy you're quoting by gaslighting it to say ""HAHAHAHAH NOT CLINTON"" but let's not pretend that this tactic was already done by Trump MAGA 2016, okay?"
