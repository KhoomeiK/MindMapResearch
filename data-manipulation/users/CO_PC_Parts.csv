So I lived in SoCal for about 4 years after college.  One of my friends got a job as a PA for Fox.  I got to go down to the sets a couple of times and holy shit everyone was so fucking tiny.  EVERYONE.  At the time I was 6'1 220 and my friend is 6'4 about 300lbs (offensive lineman in college) and we looked like giants.  

Everyone was also extremely good looking, we not only looked like giants, we looked like Shreks.  

Here's a funny tidbit, Jennifer Love Hewitt's boobs aren't that huge in person, she's just really tiny.  Also I showed up to pick up my buddy, only to find out he couldn't leave one day.  They had to do some reshoots.  They needed a couple of extras, someone grabs me to throw me out there as I'm protesting.  They're like ""you're here to work aren't you, fucking get out  there.""  Then another AD or someone yells, ""He'll stick out like a sore thumb in the background.""  They finally let me explain that I wasn't an extra and I didn't have the registration card.  I just thought it was funny watching these 2 set people arguing over using me as an extra."

AskReddit,feo15ts,t1_fenvji1,1579293647.0,"I'm pretty lucky, my great grandparents built an A frame lake cabin in 1972 in Nothern Minnesota and it's stayed in our family since.  My cousins technically own it now but the rules are all family is welcome anytime.  

It has electric but no running water in the cabin.  We have a ""shower house"" that's just a shitter into a septic tank and a free standing shower hooked up to a small water heater inside a shed.   The water is supplied by a hook up to a near by campground that we split with our neighbors.  We don't drink the water, it's pretty nasty.  You could if you put a filter/treatment on it.

We're going to install a well this year that will cost more than anything else to this point.  My cousins want running water inside and a toilet in the actual cabin.  I offered to help pay for it but haven't heard back from them.  I only go there for a week a year but plan on spending a month there this summer since now internet actually reaches it.  it's also not winterized, there's no heat sources anymore (used to have a wood stove) You'd freeze to death up there in the winter.  

It's honestly my favorite place in the world to go.  However a tornado hit it 2 years ago when I was there and now I'm a little skittish when storms roll through.  The tornado fucked up our boat, dock and trees but our cabin held up.  Our two neighbors got hit worse and part of the campground got wiped out, luckily nobody was there except me, my aunt and my neighbor."

But yes this can totally be done on a budget depending on your location.  A lake/river view might make it much more, personally I'd be fine with a spring fed stream."

nba,feljckk,t1_felh392,1579223568.0,"There was a great breakdown after the 2018 draft that showed how weird draft picks are valued and how they lose their value after a player is selected with them.  In an instant that player isn't worth his draft status because you weren't the one who picked him.

The examples were like the 6th pick is viewed really high value, it's the 6th pick, it could be anyone!  But once the Magic took Mo Bamba, then the value is, ""shit it's mo bamba he might not even play this year"" when leading into the draft Mo Bamba ""freak athlete, tremendous wingspan"" 

It was a really cool read, I can't remember if it was ESPN, 538 or Ringer.  I know they also used Mikal Bridges as another example.  And how the value of this pick goes away because you weren't the one to pick the guy if you wanted to trade.  But the team would have given up more 2 hrs earlier if you said, ""and i'll give you the 10th pick in the draft"""

An iPad or a Chromebook.  These devices open up whole worlds to people who are afraid of technology.  Plus it's really, really, hard to fuck either of them up like back in the day with an XP laptop.  

We got my grandma a chromebook 5 years ago and she loves it, uses it everyday.  A couple of my extended family aunts were still scared because they think it's a normal laptop.  So we got them iPads.  The first time we pulled up facetime for her she started crying.  Youtube, facebook, facetime and a few of their favorite games as apps and they are set.  Oh can't forget the weather app.  that shit gets checked like every 10 min."

My productivity machine connects to a 32"" 1440p 75mhz and 27"" 1080p 144mhz monitor.  I don't like the 32"" monitor, it looks BEAUTIFUL but I don't like the size for what I do on it.  I think matching another 27"" at either 1440p or 4k would improve my setup."
nba,fei2dop,t1_fehkj2o,1579128769.0,"it's always been this way.  A lot of young guys get to the league on sheer talent.  They've been the best player in their town, region, state their whole life.  I'm not saying they haven't worked hard but there's a huge difference between getting to the league and improving and staying in the league.  They also usually have ego's too, they don't think they need to work on footwork, release point, coming off picks, etc.

I think JJ is frustrated because these guys aren't putting in the work that needs to be done day to day, game to game to make it in the NBA long term.  I don't think a lot of these guys realize how short most careers are.  JJ is trying to help them and he's being brushed off."

nba,feff45w,t1_fefcdxo,1579054993.0,"They stay on the road, but they just fly to the next town the same night if on a road trip.  Then they usually let the guys sleep in.  The schedule can go a couple of different ways but usually something like this.  Guys sleep in, get a late breakfast.  Then team meeting at hotel, followed by free time which is when a lot of guys usually nap, get treatment or maybe sneak out and do some shopping.  Then a team meal either at hotel at the arena or on way to arena.  Then shootaround, more treatment if needed and then pregame.  Also usually media session mixed in there somewhere.  Guys also usually eat something light between pregame and game time.  And then the game.  

Depending on start time of the game and location to the arena some teams have their shootaround in the morning after breakfast and then go back to the hotel and guys rest then.  And if the team is playing like shit they might have a full practice, which usually doesn't go over well.  

There's a LOT of time to fill on the road, guys get plenty of rest, but they have to train their bodies to take those naps in the afternoon.  Teams are required to provide quite a bit of comforts compared to the 80's and 90's.  They aren't sharing rooms at motel 6 and flying coach anymore."
