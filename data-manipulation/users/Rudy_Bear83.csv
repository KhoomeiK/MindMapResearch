Nice to meet a fellow banana-itchy-mouther"

I do still think my point is valid though. I do think that the trillions of dollars being spent on 'Defence' could be better distributed amongst other, life changing areas (cancer research being just one of those). World hunger. Poverty. Education. Basically anything else. There hasn't been a need for trillion-dollar military spending since the 1940s (and even that probably didn't even require this level of financing). I'm not suggesting increasing the budget, rather a simple change of distribution with what's currently in play"

Instead of bullshit 'wars on terror', with bloated military budgets. Imagine what these scientists could do with even just 1 years worth of the 'Defence' budget? Cancer would just be some old, long forgotten illness like the plague or TB."

It's essentially an Opiate that doesn't cross the brain blood barrier, so it alleviates wd, but doesn't get you high in any way.
