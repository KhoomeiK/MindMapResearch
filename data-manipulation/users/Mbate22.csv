A sudden change like that could be due to mental illness surfacing (what age was she when the change happened?) Or some kind of trauma that happened and she didn't say anything, or past trauma surfacing. Therapy may help if she is interested, individual, not marriage counseling. Even if she refuses to go maybe you can benefit from it. Possible benefits of you going in to therapy:

You have a safe place to vent.

You learn new tools for dealing with your wife and possibly opening up a line of effective communication. Or tools to deal with the possible split and how to help your children understand what's going on.
