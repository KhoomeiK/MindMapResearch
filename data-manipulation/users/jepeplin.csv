Lawyertalk,ff5v6nt,t3_erp3yi,1579611367.0,Get good grades in college. Pick an easy major that you will enjoy. So many people pick difficult majors thinking it will help them in their chosen field of law eventually and all it does is make college that much harder. You want to show really good grades so- sociology FTW!

I love this work and would never change but I have a great work environment.  I agree that the subject matter can really get to you, though. EMDR really worked for me."

Lawyertalk,fcy6x0t,t3_ej7za3,1578075679.0,"I’m in court all day every day and I have been for 16 years. I like public speaking, speaking on the fly, keeping case info in my brain, and working quickly. I have a heavy caseload and being able to speak persuasively and advocate effectively all day is a must. That said, many of my colleagues are not like me. They are much more paper-heavy, filing motions and circulating stips and generally working a lot in the office, alone. In the rest of my life I am an introvert. So a legal career is what you make of it, it all depends on what kind of law you want to practice and what your style is."

legaladvice,fcorurj,t3_ei8pjg,1577839862.0,"In my jurisdiction, if you make under $17 an hour you qualify for free legal counsel. So you might qualify, I don’t know. But you would need to file a petition to modify the current custody order, make the required copies, attach a copy of the existing order, and submit it. If you do this yourself, just put everything in there that you put here. You need to show a change of circumstances since the issuance of the last order, which would be the hospitalization of Grandma. You need to find and serve mom (not you but someone over 18). At the first appearance you should be given court appointed counsel, or you can hire your own, or you can go it alone."

I’m also in the US but on the Canadian border so I get it done there and save money on the exchange rate. I pay 600 for two vials, one in each cheek. I’ve gotten it done in the nasolabial folds but didn’t notice any difference. But the cheeks, wow, it is like a face lift. I just got mine done again and feel like going back for another two vials but can’t afford it. And I have gotten a ton of sun in my life."

It’s a 4-5 day process for me, and that’s with taking arnica for a week and eating pineapple for days before. Lips are just that way. Don’t worry, they’ll come down. I still had bumps in my lips for weeks but I massaged them from the inside and they weren’t visible."
