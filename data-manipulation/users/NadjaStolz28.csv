I mean, I get that it grosses you out.

The point of those articles is to show that ""just tell him you're not interested"" can often lead to horrible reactions, no matter how ""nice"" the guy can seem to others. Even one death, or even one violent incident is too many.

And those are just the extremes. If you took a sample group of 5 women, I'm willing to bet at least 1-3 of them could share an experience where they told a man they weren't interested, and were met with insults and horrible behavior. Hell, there's a whole sub about it (r/niceguys).

Please, for the sake of all the women in your life and your brother’s life, listen to what people are saying on this thread.

So. True.
I felt so uncomfortable every time I would hang out with a group of other military wives. They were nice enough, but there was always this weird undercurrent of entitlement and obsession with only talking about the military and life of a military spouse.
Yes, it is hard when your spouse is gone for months at a time. But so often there was this “we have it harder” mentality and one-upsmanship, even amongst each other that I found bewildering.
Didn’t help that I was pretty much the only one that was childless. If the conversation wasn’t about the military, it was about kids.

\-she didn't tell you for a few days: whether she'll admit it or not that was an intentional move.

\-she said she would kiss him: even if she took it back, that means there is an attraction there, and those are dangerous grounds to walk on if you two want to maintain a committed relationship.

\-she fully plans to stay in touch with a guy who is available (in a sense) and interested in her, and one she has already admitted attraction to.

I'd recommend having a serious talk with your girlfriend about this if you want to continue your relationship. If she can't see why you're upset, then there might be a big problem there."

Your ex sucks for obvious reasons that you know and other commenters have highlighted.

But you are absolutely TA as well for trying to dictate how someone feels.

I have broken up with people before (although it was in a better way, face to face), and I have felt absolutely awful about it. I got my first intense migraine after I broke up with my first boyfriend.

Just because they broke up with you, absolutely does not mean they’re not hurting and confused either.

Regardless of how he broke up with you (which, yes, it was an asshole way to do it which is why he is TA too), it’s a total asshole move to tell someone how they should or shouldn’t feel.

Edit: I want to clarify; OP, I don’t think you’re an asshole in general. I have also been in a relationship with someone with clinical depression, and it’s incredibly hard. You sound like a good person for all you’ve done for your ex.

I’m just saying the action of gatekeeping someone’s feelings — that alone is an asshole move."
