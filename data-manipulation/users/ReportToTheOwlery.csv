books,ff31ibe,t1_ff21bdw,1579531194.0,"I absolutely loved Dune, read it in two nights and was absolutely worthless at work the following days while still trying to talk to EVERYONE about how amazing it was. I’ve been struggling with Dune Messiah since then... five years ago. I recently got the audiobook from the library and am still struggling. I don’t know what it is. I’m thinking if I can pay attention long enough, I’d be able to follow along, but I’m struggling with the first few chapters, repeatedly. This is probably attempt number 15. Still losing my attention around the same spot (about an hour in on the audiobook). If I get further in, Will it grab me? It just has been such a struggle."
