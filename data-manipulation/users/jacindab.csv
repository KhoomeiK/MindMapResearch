DotA2,fee6wsh,t1_fedq8f3,1579027646.0,Ah I see. My mistake!
DotA2,fedlnsz,t3_eokknv,1579014584.0,Great work! Was also excited to see another DotA costume up for votes!

MaliciousCompliance,feddvwf,t1_fedbmzl,1579008780.0,"In Nebraska, speeding fines are set by the county you get the ticket in. Got one way out west and was offered a diversion if I took their Stop Class and didn't get a ticket for 3 years.  I got my ticket in one of the extremely low-population counties out west, so my class cost me $252. Someone in my class got one for the same amount over the limit, cost them $78 because they got the ticket in Omaha. It's ridiculous to me that there can be that much a discrepancy in fines for the same infraction!"

todayilearned,fd5jai8,t1_fd5dxh9,1578178213.0,"How is it going over there? We lived in Nebraska when Colorado legalized. The counties out west burned through most of their yearly budgets in the first four months because they went apeshit and were setting up little blockades (idk the right word for it) to stop cars and search them for pot. I think Nebraska may have tried to sue Colorado for expenses related to it. Pretty sure Colorado just told them, ""Well stop checking every single car on I-80 and you won't have that problem."""
todayilearned,fd5dl0l,t1_fd5de2z,1578176588.0,Clicked the link. Was not disappointed. Thank you!

In Iowa they publish your name and hometown. Kinda sucks, but a guy from Arcadia (near us) just won $148k right before Christmas so I guess he can go cry into his piles of cash lol."

todayilearned,fd4yj8u,t1_fd42a7b,1578172408.0,"So the Larry Loss whose signature is on that check is married to my aunt, who is the head of PR for the Iowa lottery. She says one of her favorite parts of her job is getting to make people happy with simple things like this. Craziest stories they tell us involve people who win massive amounts of money and end up broke within 10 years because they don't know how to manage that much money. Rule #1 if you win a huge jackpot is get a lawyer. #2 is sign your ticket and keep it somewhere safe."

AskReddit,fckgycx,t3_ehg5ac,1577725096.0,"Was driving back across Nebraska after a family funeral.  I pulled into a large truck stop for gas, there's normally a stoplight to get back on the highway since there's two big stations there. Because of flood damage, this part of the highway is under construction and reduced to two lanes of traffic with a four-way stop intersection instead of normal lights.

As I'm sitting at the stop sign, I hear my husband's voice in my head talking about how he never trusts people to properly signal at intersections and something in my gut tells me to stay put as I see a big semi barreling towards the intersection. Sure enough, the semi blows through the stop signs right when I would've been driving through."
containergardening,fby0q7v,t3_eez403,1577205299.0,"I learned from a friend this summer that you're supposed to pluck off the little ""sucker"" shoots that try to grow where a branch already has grown. Apparently they can cause the vines to break because they weaken where the original branch grows out of.  I have no idea where he got the advice from, but I finally had a summer where the vines didn't start snapping off (even with a tomato cage).

You want to look for new leaves trying to grow in the elbow part of where the existing branches grow from the main vine, just pinch them with your fingers and they'll come off. Saved my plants from having the side branches fall off!"
