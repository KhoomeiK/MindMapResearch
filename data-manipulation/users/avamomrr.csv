When you are ready, you can introduce yourself and give out your number for calls. There will be a “newcomer greeter” whom you can call and talk about the program, but only if you want it. It is gentler than you think. Go to oahowphonemeetings.com to find a meeting time and just call in and listen. There is a meeting tonight from 8-10 eastern time. 

There is also a Telegram group you can join to chat with people if you wish. Let me know and I can give you the connection information.

Bariatric Surgeons don't operate on your brain... and that is where at least a big part of the disease lies. I share the pain you are feeling. We have the same disease. Unfortunately, this disease cannot be cured by surgery--an addiction cannot be cut out of us. Nor does reducing the food's pathway cure it. When you wake up with a lap band, you will still be a food addict. OA is not a cure, it is a daily reprieve contingent on following a set of practices that we do together.

The self-resentment you feel is actually *part of the disease* and this can and will be healed in time as you work on this OA program. It is an integrated program, and I have found that doing ALL the suggested tools and taking the steps with a sponsor works. We say ""it works if you work it"" and that means all of it. The program treats a specific condition that has no medical cure - this IS the 'cure' for me. Phone meetings are a good way to start. Please DM me if you want some links to meetings and other information. Welcome home."

When you decide to take care of yourself, some others can be challenged by this, especially if they have problems with food, too. Your friend wants you to listen to her feelings - you can do that without eating. Can you change locations and go to a coffee shop instead? If not, get a small item and then tell your friend you are there to listen to her. Focus on her, not on food. Show her you are listening. If friend challenges you about not eating with her, brush it off for now, ""just not feeling hungry right now - I want more to hear about you.""

OvereatersAnonymous,fdgk6h2,t3_el8iao,1578400031.0,"Hi pandapear61. This is the healthy part of you, reaching out for help. That is great - I know it doesn't feel that way, but your outreach is an act of self-love. For me, the part of OA I wanted *least* was ""fellowship."" I did not want to have to talk to anyone or pretend to be nice or listen to other people complain about their problems. I just wanted someone > the ones with the magic formula < to tell me how to get over my ""little problem with food."" (That's how I saw it.) Just help me lose weight, and then I will be off... back to my life, as I control it... In my mind, despite having tried even diet out there, I thought I just didn't have the right diet. People in OA seemed happy, slim, healthy - why? Argh - don't make me talk to people... 

Now, 14 years in the OA program, the thing I value *most* is the fellowship. I have hundreds of phone numbers of people I can call to help me when I experience those hard-to-handle highs and lows of life, as you so eloquently described. When I was ""in the food,"" I didn't realize how lonely I was, food was a companion, but a selfish one. Now, I live an abstinent life and I have a higher power and lots of amazing people to help me each day. I hope you will get to a meeting and get a few phone numbers of long-time members to call. Ask them how they got abstinent and what worked for them. I would be happy to talk to you, if you wish. DM me. Welcome, friend."

history,fcr2oat,t3_eihv28,1577895903.0,"In 18th century, German industry had become reliant upon verifiable knowledge. Those who could verify knowledge (we call scientists) received patronage. With this support, German scientists took the time to write down and openly share the results of their experiments. Others seeking to emulate Germany's industrial leadership tracked these activities and they were able to validate findings. As a result, German work came to be viewed as the leading edge of knowledge by the19th century. Foreigners came to study in professional laboratories with these people, further propelling Germans to achievement and notability. Links to industry, a common, flexible language, shared infrastructure, and acolytes are critical to scientific leadership. Although infrastructure was destroyed in the wars, Germany returned to world-class scientific capacity in the 20th century."
