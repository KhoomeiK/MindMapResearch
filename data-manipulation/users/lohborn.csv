Do you mean have the pieces plated with rose gold? In that case it depends on how you intend to use them. Will they rub enough for the plating to come off.

Do you mean have them melted down and alloyed with more copper to make them into 18k rose gold? You could do that if you wanted something entirely different. Depending on the total amount of gold it might be worth it."

This is maybe the biggest difference.  In the 90s people talked about 'running out of oil' and worried that we would have a crisis because prices would get too high.

It turns out that there is a huge amount of oil in the world and if we burned all of it climate change would causes a much worse crisis before we came close to running out."

The color of light that things make when they glow hot depends pretty much only on the temperature. The fact that incandescent lights are only half the temperature of the surface of the sun tells us that they will be yellower/redder than the light from the sun.  Halogen lights can be hotter which explains why their light is whiter, more like the Sun's."
Cooking,fdkhyef,t3_elvoox,1578504228.0,"One of my favorite light dishes is Chinese Ginger Chicken.

If you are using breasts: 

 * Boil the breast until just *barely* done (or use sous vide if you've got it)
 * Heat finely chopped ginger and scallions in sesame oil until fragrant.
 * Turn off heat and add soy sauce to the sesame oil
 * pour over chicken
 * serve with rice and stir fried vegetables

If you are using whole chicken

 * put chicken in pot and just cover with water. 
 * Bring to a boil and then turn off and let rest
 * Make sauce the same
 * This method is great because it makes a nice clear broth to put on the rice."
explainlikeimfive,fdkhluk,t3_elvk2o,1578504041.0,"Laser light is special because it has a single frequency (think color of light) and it is all in phase (all the waves line up). Most light has a least some spread of frequency and the light waves don't all line up. 

Laser stands for **Light Amplification through Stimulated Emission**. Let's look at what that means. 

**Amplification** means that you start with a small amount of the light you want and then add energy to it from another type of light. A laser has a light source that powers it but that light source is just regular light, not special laser light. That light shines on a special material called the **lasing medium**.

The lasing medium's electrons get excited to a higher state because they were hit with the light. Normally when an electron is excited it will wait a bit then randomly jump down to their regular state. That does happen some in a laser and that produces light of the right frequency (color). 

The laser has a mirror on the back so that that light gets reflected back over the lasing medium again. When the reflected light hits the electrons that are excited in the lasing medium you get **stimulated emission,** which means that an electron that is already excited is forced to release the energy because it was hit with light. This is critical to a laser because in stimulated emission, the light that hit the electron and the light that come out are in phase. Now you have the special laser light. You can keep powering it with a regular light now it will all be in phase.

**Why the lasing medium matters so much:** The lasing medium determines the frequency. Also, the special properties of the medium determine if stimulated emission is possible and will happen enough to get a laser."
