zoloft,fdmc2es,t1_fdma4ya,1578545185.0,My doctor said that it creates dopamine but I don’t believe it. I’ve been off of it for two weeks & I feel way better. He just doesn’t want to give me anything else
zoloft,fdjb3nk,t3_elkbqm,1578463866.0,Yeah same here. I told my doctor it wasn’t helping at all but he keeps insisting to keep doing it. he kept saying that it was the safest drug to prescribe I think that’s why he’s consistent about it. Still doesn’t help. You should try to talk to your doctor maybe you can get something else to help you out or something on top of that.

benzodiazepines,fdeayoo,t1_fddkke6,1578335060.0,Ooo I love Xanax. Diazepam. Klonopin. Hmm what else is there to try?
benzodiazepines,fdeavcz,t1_fddpy3f,1578335003.0,Take .5 it won’t be as bad :) you build a tolerance too quite quick. A bit goes a long way
benzodiazepines,fdeaile,t3_ekqpjc,1578334778.0,Valium all the way baby. So hard to get my hands on it though
Anxiety,fdeabz2,t1_fdditlu,1578334662.0,Oh no way. It’s crazy it’s all in the mind  :( sorry you gotta go through that. I feel tense like very tense so I just wanna avoid situations that will make me feel like that. Do you ever take medicine for it?
Anxiety,fde7lnw,t1_fdcfjye,1578332935.0,Damn my head does the same thing too. I always want to leave certain situations but I force myself to stay but that makes it worse. That’s a good way to settle down
