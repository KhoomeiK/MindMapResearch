uwaterloo,ff9jvke,t3_ermcue,1579714556.0,"For myself, I don’t eat beef because cows take up too much space, (I do eat bulgogi though that’s good shit) and I don’t care much for pork, but chickens are easy to kill quickly, give you eggs,  and don’t take up much space. My family and I have raised chickens, collected their eggs, and killed them when they stopped laying all my life in my town in Costa Rica. In Costa rica cows tend to be in small herds and just eat the grass around them, so they don’t put too much strain on the the ecosystem, but we have beef around once every 2 weeks. pigbelly is popular as a side dish, so I’d say pigs and chickens are eaten more. 

The truth is, I don’t care if an animal dies so long as it doesn’t need to suffer. Cutting off a chickens head is a near instant death (body only moves after due to nerve shocks, there is no pain as pain receptors have been fully severed). What made me I was not in the wrong for killing chickens for food is after I watched some  dogs break into my chicken coop and rip apart my poor chickens. The dogs did not care that they caused pain and forced these animals to bleed to death slowly while crying, their bodies were mangled and muscles ripped and they all died screaming. The dogs didn’t even eat them, they just thought it was fun. When my dad kills a chicken, we use all of its body and it’s for a purpose, to feed ourselves and our loved ones. The birds die quickly after a life of eating bugs and corn and wandering a garden."

bestoflegaladvice,fem7zdy,t1_fekkg92,1579243048.0,^^^ every single horror story was running through my head. I half expected a clown to be standing at the bottom of the stairs with heads of the poor babies in each hand singing a creepy song.
bestoflegaladvice,fekivsp,t1_fekgnwf,1579200975.0,"I've not heard a fox, but coyotes similarly sound rather scary. Yeah, it was terrifying because I thought it was one of the girls screaming but they were fast asleep. Even worse, all of the children slept in the basement, and while the basement was very pretty and well done, I was still terrified going down there to check on the kids."

I was watching a horror film on Netflix after I had put the kids to sleep and the peacock began wailing like a banshee. I couldn’t find the noise and was convinced the kids were in danger until I pulled back the curtain and saw the little fuck staring at me through the window. I love peacocks, but hate their screaming."

That said, it is crazy to me that the entrance to a building was covered in so much ice without warning. I get it’s a Sunday, but people are still out and about, you’d think that they’d put down some sand or salt."

Therefore, most people and businesses just try and pass it off on each other. My dad showed me how to inspect for counterfeit before you go to deposit money. If it’s counterfeit, go spend that $$.

They may send you home and even that might give a bad impression, unfortunately, but at least you showed you were willing to make be most of a bad situation. The alternative is, if it’s really bad, to go to the hospital and inform your workplace you had to go to the ER."
