sports,fgrxg72,t1_fgribr1,1581061399.0,Nash went to Santa Clara.  Had sex with Tom Brady.  Some of that is true.
sports,fgrx93v,t1_fgr6691,1581061161.0,"So hard to say.  He definitely appears (from this one clip that is,) to have the athleticism.  But if he's not a good/great shooter and/or extremely good ball-handler, passer, and has great ""court-vision"" then the odds are very long.   But u never know! Again, he appears to have the athleticism so if he loves the game enough and works hard enough at being a tremendous ball-handler, passer, shooter etc., it could happen!"
sports,fgrw62e,t1_fgrnli9,1581059888.0,We all have sponsors in AA.
nba,fgqdfzc,t1_fgpyjrz,1581022122.0,That's what she said.
WTF,fgppdhw,t1_fgpjh3j,1581009398.0,Yup.  Poison is ingested.  Venom is injected.

gifsthatkeepongiving,fg6lh7p,t1_fg6hll6,1580571088.0,"Seriously.  And and ugly RV and lame modern truck? Put an old classic pickup and a tractor or something.  -That said, still an amazing job!"
aww,fg6ka1t,t1_fg6e2w1,1580570218.0,Seriously!  I had no idea they got that big.
aww,fg6jb1b,t1_fg66qqb,1580569493.0,Seems more retreaty than pouncy
Showerthoughts,fg6j2ly,t1_fg6at8l,1580569318.0,"Well, that sample size is good enough for me. /s"
Showerthoughts,fg6ii7s,t1_fg6dqo9,1580568890.0,There's still no such thing as a 320 lb linebacker.  Not on any conventional team that is.
Showerthoughts,fg6hl9j,t1_fg6brnq,1580568186.0,Shots fired!
Showerthoughts,fg6gfer,t1_fg6f4ql,1580567259.0,"With the ladies that is.  -although back then who knows, maybe they liked a nice plump buddy who could easily wave off a few flesh wounds."
Showerthoughts,fg6g60i,t1_fg6c41h,1580567045.0,Just cause you wanna chop down a tree doesn't mean it has to fall on your house.
Showerthoughts,fg6g0pb,t1_fg6dqwl,1580566921.0,I would think you'd want to be as strong but with more mass.  Although with more mass you lose some quickness and stamina more quickly.  Always interesting tradeoffs.

Unexpected,fe3qexb,t1_fe3nz31,1578851872.0,Or a Bro.
MadeMeSmile,fdxuttj,t1_fdwgxbn,1578773115.0,"Reminds me of the Brady Bunch episode when Bobby wants to run away.  Mike is super chill and taking things very seriously and explains to Bobby that he'll have to make money to support himself so he asks, ""Well, what can you do, Bob?"" -pretty sure it was the first time he ever called him Bob, not Bobby, kind of driving home the adult nature of things.  Anyway, Bob responds somewhat sheepishly but also with confidence, ""Weeell, I can finger paint, and glue stuff!""  -lol good times."
