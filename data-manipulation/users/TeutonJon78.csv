The Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) governs airlines. You can look up each individual airlines policy to see how each one of them differs in what they allow and what they require.

ESAs DON'T have to accommodated in hospitals/schools/stores/restaurants/etc -- only housing and public transit. That's why so many ESA havers get those service dog vests so that they don't get asked questions.

And even service animals (which is only dogs and mini-horses) can be thrown out of a place if they are actually causing problems, as long as the owner can come in without them and/or they are allowed back in the future.

If a dog is just a pet, they have to be down in the cargo hold in a carrier with the luggage. I believe smaller animals are still allowed in cabin as long as they stay on your lap contained or under the seat.

If this dog in the OP photo is just by itself, it's either a service animal (unlikely since it's on a seat and also not paying attention to it's owner) or an ESA. Or a private flight.
