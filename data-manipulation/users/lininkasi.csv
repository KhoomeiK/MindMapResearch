Everyone else thinks they're so wonderful because that's the only image The Narcissist projects for everyone else to see.

He had a sister, who in the world of mendelian recessive had a 50% chance of being a carrier.

I remember a long time back my grandmother was tune to some talk program back in the days and this woman was up for an interview and I distinctly recall her being sorrowful and crying that she couldn't hold her boy, couldn't play with them like other children, all the usual litany in a case like this. I was sympathetic until I learned, some years later, that this woman had had a child previous to this, little boy with the ailment that would died of it.

Lately though and in more and more States as time goes by, if paternity shows the child does not belong to the man the child support can be dropped.

In cases where Mommy wants to pretend to be independent but still wants the wallet support, it only means that mommy may go on welfare. Or become hard. But for children who have thought of the guy as Dad, and the man walks out, it can be quite a blow I would think.

However the guy has got to be sure if they're ever tagged not to drop it and let some state agency tell them that they're okay. Cuz state agencies don't give a damn if they make a mistake if they can keep some mu off of the welfare rolls. So if they tag you make sure you get a paternity test and make sure your legal ass is covered"
