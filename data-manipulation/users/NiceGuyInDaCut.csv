My mother once told me she would abandon me and let me fight dogs for food when I was a child, about 12. lol. She just loaned me $10K and in 2016 she loaned my $16K to buy a house when I really needed to move from where I was. Point is, she loves you and she was just upset. If you were on your last she would be there for you and If she was not upset and thinking rationally she would likely not say those hurtful things.
