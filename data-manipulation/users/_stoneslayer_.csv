politics,ffh2lyf,t1_ffgxvas,1579921429.0,I just replied to a different comment with this but I really think you should listen to him explain his conversation philosophy on a recent episode. It starts at around [1:58:00](https://youtu.be/XiWYB_xTd9k) and is maybe 7 or 8 minutes long. Seems like a lot of people on both sides of the political aisle think of him as providing a dangerous platform for the other side but I really don't think that's the case
politics,ffh1g82,t1_ffgeuwk,1579920554.0,He talks about this a lot on the podcast but in one of the most recent episodes he explained his thinking really well at around [1:58:00](https://youtu.be/XiWYB_xTd9k). I see this brought up about the podcast by people on both sides of the political aisle and I truly believe it's a misinformed opinion.

Revolution in their minds the children start to march  
Against the world in which they have to live  
And all the hate that's in their hearts  
They're tired of being pushed around  
And told just what to do  
They'll fight the world until they've won  
And love comes flowing through, yeah  

Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today  
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?  
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?  
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear, yeah  

So you children of the world  
Listen to what I say  
If you want a better place to live in  
Spread the words today  
Show the world that love is still alive you must be brave  
Or you children of today are children of the grave,"

Some flamboyant gay man walking down Main South in Worcester is more likely to get fucked with than your average person imo. Obviously that's a stereotypical idea of what gay men are but it seems logical? I've always thought it was a little weird that so many African Americans are so into fundamental christianity when it's so closely tied to the slavery that brought them here.

I just meant that poor people who grow up around a whole lot of other poor people are generally much more aware of who they let their guard down around. Sort of like prison.

ifyoulikeblank,felziz7,t3_epsmk4,1579235024.0,A bit more jazz than r&b but [Sade](https://youtu.be/C8QJmI_V3j4) is the ultimate chill band
ifyoulikeblank,felzac5,t3_epusnw,1579234822.0,"Check out the youtube channel GemsOnVHS. Mostly young folk singers. A lot of amazing songwriting.

Documentaries,felu9pe,t1_fel8u0h,1579231089.0,One of the points he made was that these sort of barbaric acts probably weren't that uncommon for a lot of human history. The thing that makes this particular event really stand out is how recent it was. Humans are capable of a wide spectrum of behaviours depending on the situations we find ourselves in

dataisbeautiful,fegwdtf,t1_feghmie,1579104019.0,It was crazy cheap either way. I did the actual membership deal they offered which was basically buy a cd within 3 months and get like 8 free. And then each time they sent the catalogue it would rotate between buy one get unlimited 80% off and unlimited buy one get 3 free. I ended up buying hundreds of cds from them for $2 or $3 a piece

PublicFreakout,fe67rxg,t1_fe4m2jj,1578883677.0,"Funnily enough the bass player Geezer Butler wrote the majority of their lyrics. He's one of my favorite songwriters.

Revolution in their minds the children start to march  
Against the world in which they have to live  
And all the hate that's in their hearts  
They're tired of being pushed around  
And told just what to do  
They'll fight the world until they've won  
And love comes flowing through, yeah  

Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today  
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?  
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?  
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear, yeah  

So you children of the world  
Listen to what I say  
If you want a better place to live in  
Spread the words today  
Show the world that love is still alive you must be brave  
Or you children of today are children of the grave,"

worldnews,fdpkwdq,t1_fdpef3b,1578631457.0,"The problem as I see it is that regardless of the particular issue, very few people are willing to concede any ground on their views and opinions. The idea that *you* might be wrong in any capacity doesn't seem to be an option for most people. It's all ego and tribalism. It's not about meeting in the middle. It's about communicating thoughts and ideas in a civilized way and trying to understand why the people who disagree with you feel the way they do"

todayilearned,fcp5vko,t1_fcp4v37,1577851476.0,That's interesting. In all likelihood I'd still guess both play a role. Some flamboyant gay man walking down Main South in Worcester is more likely to get fucked with than your average person imo. Obviously that's a stereotypical idea of what gay men are but it seems logical? I've always thought it was a little weird that so many African Americans are so into fundamental christianity when it's so closely tied to the slavery that brought them here. I guess it gives people in bad situations hope for a better future
todayilearned,fcp587y,t1_fcp3lmy,1577850860.0,"I mean I get that gentrification is a thing but there's still a ton of poor people that live in cities. I guess it's not literally the *inner* city in a lot of major cities but that wasn't my point. I just meant that poor people who grow up around a whole lot of other poor people are generally much more aware of who they let their guard down around. Sort of like prison. If you don't carry yourself a certain way, people will test you. It seems like that's the reason for those people being homophobic rather than religion"
