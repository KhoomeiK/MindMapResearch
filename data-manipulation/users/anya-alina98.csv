I don't know why she didn't perscribe me peroxide then... ugh."
offmychest,fd29a58,t1_fd26kzu,1578143698.0,Anxiety usually. Sometimes it also stems from eating disorders.
offmychest,fd2978z,t3_ejuso9,1578143661.0,"That's awesome!

I also have a lot of trouble eating by myself. Sometimes eating out with my friends even. Never went to a restaurant alone though so props to you!"

witchcraft,fcia34n,t3_eh71x4,1577659610.0,"I live in Slovenia and also can't sleep.

I usually go to bed at about 11, now I stay awake 'till 2AM if it's a good night.

But other than that, I've been feeling really good. Like really positive and full of energy. 

But then again I feel like I can't sleep because of that. Like my whole body is tired but my mind is having a party."

socialskills,fci3aa9,t1_fci1nj3,1577657247.0,"Well at least you know what you're gonna do after hahaa. I'll be lucky if I find a job.

That really sucks though when you think about it. I never thought about it like that before. 

When you're young you always have something new to look forward to. But then you just kind of stay in the same place. Fuck"
witchcraft,fchvvoj,t1_fcc4riz,1577654750.0,"Same here. 

I could personally never bring myself to do a spell wishing someone bad luck or putting a curse on someone.

I kind of grew up with the mindset my mom, that previously had some experience with Slavic folk magic told me. It's basically along the lines of: what you wish for someone else will happen to you. 

I personally think of magic as more of redirecting energy. Kind of manipulating the world around you. So if you give out negative energy, it'll come back to you."
socialskills,fchhkiv,t3_eh8h4l,1577650551.0,"It seems to me like you're depressed honestly.

tattoos,fch3k0r,t1_fcexnjk,1577646912.0,"It really depends on the type of scars.

My initial worries were similar to yours cause I read a bunch of stuff like that.

But when I came to my tattoo artist she said that it won't be a problem at all. I was still pretty full of doubt, I at least thought that I would have to come back again to get it retouched since scar tissue usually doesn't pick up pigment that well. 

But honestly, it turned out perfect. I have flowers, and the leaves are completely black, which is hard to tattoo on normal skin in a way that it doesn't turn out patchy. But it came out perfect on the first try. The pigment held on great and this is 4 months after it healed. 

About the pain, I don't know if the outer thigh hurts without scars, cause this is my first outer thigh tattoo, but for me the tattoo didn't hurt at all. It was like a 3/10. She was tattooing me for 5 hours and the only thing that was uncomfortable was the pose that I had to be in on my side cause my arm got numb. The tattoo was equivalent to an upper arm tattoo, if you have one. 

It is very important to choose organic type of tattoos when tattooing over scars. Don't choose something geometric, cause the lines wont be straight."
tattoos,fcejotb,t3_eh3xwb,1577621125.0,"I just got mine covered up on my left hip in august! 

It's amazing! Finally am comfortable showing my legs again. 

Wish you the best and covering up and staying clean from selfharm <3"

As a girl, this would automatically make me like you more hahaha"
offmychest,fc8m4qf,t3_egonvr,1577537754.0,"I completely agree! I'm 21 now.

I see all my friends in relationships that have been going on since both of them were like 16 and I think: thank god. Thank god I didn't get into a serious relationship when I was younger. 

Those types of people literally can't live without each other after they break up. It's so weird seeing, how they have to kind of go though puberty later in life."
Hyperhidrosis,fc85tiz,t1_fc733vn,1577527518.0,"Yeah unfortunately. But that's for me. 

I don't know if you shave your armpits, try to shave them every other day, and apply the antiperspirant in the evenings you didn't shave.

Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT, apply right after shaving cause you will cry.  
But I feel also like the itchiness is only at the beginning, your skin then starts to get used to it."
Hyperhidrosis,fc6lt6o,t3_egh9qb,1577483608.0,Certain dri worked great for the armpits. Don't know about hands and feet though. But I think there are some creams that help.
hsp,fc012q7,t3_ef9qji,1577272957.0,"I'm a big cry baby. Like I cry for literally the stupidest things ever. 

But I can't cry in public. From kindergarten up to college I've cried 2 times in school setting. 

And both of those times were in kindergarten. 

ALSO, the first time I watched Endgame I didn't cry because I was in the cinema. I cried like a baby when I watched it at home though."
