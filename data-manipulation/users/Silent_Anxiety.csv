My kitty plays fetch, she will bat her mouse back to you like she's playing volleyball, she obsessively follows me from room to room even if I'm only in there for a second, plays hide and seek ""for real!"", waits patiently by a certain chair at night, just waiting for me to tell her that's its bedtime now, and then makes MAD DASH to bedroom to beat me to the bed"
