Just guessing as far as the chinese character goes but prayer beads are used to count mantras during meditation and often either look like a necklace or bracelet."

Corporations like Safeway don't like to just show people their footage, especially footage that is evidence their liability for an assault on a customer by a shoplifter. 

Any premises liability claim against Safeway and obtaining the footage would need to be handled by a tort attorney. I think that even if police got a hold of the footage they wouldn't be compelled to show or give it to you directly."

Noting human causes like tossing a cig without stamping it out, leaving campfires unattended, neglecting to put out campfires, neglecting to put out bbq coals, burning brush during a burn ban, etc would've been more helpful to raise awareness during drought to help end accidental fires. No one can prevent lightning, after all.
