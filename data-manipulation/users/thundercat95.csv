nba,ffo6evr,t3_eubekc,1580074585.0,I’m not even a Kobe Bryant fan and this is shocking to me. Up there with when I found out Steve Irwin passed away when I was a kid. I Just would never expect that headline. So sad and one of his kids was with him. And not just them the other people in the helicopter. It’s so sad life being cut short due to an accident.
nba,ffjicqh,t3_etxt8t,1579998874.0,So much enthusiasm. Does he even wanna be there lol

AskReddit,ff95ezm,t3_es53p0,1579705261.0,"Welp time to read a checklist about myself.....

But I will contribute, when a person isnt authentic and they try to mold their personality to what they think people want to be around.

Also people who obsessively only talk or think about themselves, 

This one in particular is what makes me boring. Limited social life. If you hardly go anywhere it’s hard to make new experiences or meet people. It’s not always true but the person who’s travelled the world and met and experienced new things will most likely have some stories to tell."
Mariners,ff4obe0,t3_erkrhk,1579568484.0,Nooooo!!!! New braves fan here lol I just want to see him succeed no matter how small the role is. I hate seeing him get lit up

gifs,fetaf9i,t3_eqe48u,1579373313.0,As someone with lower back pain that looks awfully painful down the road. Still incredibly impressive just worried they’ll screw up their back
millionairemakers,ferd9fe,t3_eq81a8,1579352573.0,Money pays bills. Stress reduced. Me want less stress
AskReddit,fepvffv,t3_eq7gkm,1579332710.0,"I went through stages. Early elementary I was super shy, then became a class clown. By high school I was a complete recluse who lost all social skills. I was the loner kid in the back of the class that I’m guessing some people thought would shoot up the school"
transpassing,feh3rmn,t1_feftw6l,1579108537.0,I understand I just want you to know tho if you feel ready to come out I’d encourage you to face the anxiety I think it would be worth it. But only if you’re ready
transpassing,feeft6r,t3_eoo1v7,1579032876.0,I see a female. I’m also curious why you’ve waited this long. I’ve been on hormones for close to half a year and I’m not even close to ready myself.
ravens,fe00u9i,t1_fe00roq,1578800337.0,Casual fan but isn’t the guy super young? Seems weird to get rid of him when the entire team is playing bad too
Seahawks,fdlx5bw,t3_em0tov,1578534615.0,Marshawn Lynch is the fucking best man! Love how he’s super supportive of homer this unknown dude and making him feel like a part of the team. His energy and swagger just spread throughout the team. Go hawks!!!
Seahawks,fdlvpxk,t1_fdkse83,1578533629.0,Those photos are amazing!!! Are you a professional by chance? Or just got a great camera

Seahawks,fden5ml,t3_ekzdgq,1578342537.0,Haha I love it
nfl,fdcj0vw,t3_eklx2d,1578276104.0,"I didn’t think the play was dirty when I saw it live just thought it was bad luck. Seeing the replays it’s definitely at the very least deserving of a penalty which they never gave. I want a competitive fight, winning against a 40 year old backup is....not the same."
Seahawks,fdc5o18,t3_ekj94i,1578267596.0,There we go baby!!!!!
Seahawks,fdc24tu,t3_ekj94i,1578265603.0,Beast mode!!!!!!
buffalobills,fd68lgf,t3_ek2ogw,1578187162.0,Refs weren’t great but the bills had no excuse giving up the 3rd and 18 or the two missed tackles of Watson. Heartbreaker indeed but you guys look like you may overtake the patriots next year (please football gods I’m sick of the patriots)
buffalobills,fd640s9,t3_ek2ogw,1578185224.0,Casual observer here. Wtf is going on with Allen. He looks scared. That lateral could have been a disaster.
transpassing,fd39bxc,t3_ejvuwp,1578155973.0,Great pic love your hair
transpassing,fd0q0m4,t3_ejnmr5,1578122208.0,I thought your profile may be nsfw lol you’re very pretty I like your hair
depression,fcwvkd8,t3_eja8lo,1578039422.0," Very pretty, you’ve got a talent"
depression,fcwtrnd,t3_ej8bc2,1578037282.0,"I’ve researched numerous ways to do it. From my research there’s always the risk of screwing up, regretting last minute or being left with a permanent disability and still alive. Even the most effective methods such as a gun can leave the person alive. People have survived point blank shots to the head. 

This isn’t the forum for your answers. I doubt people will want to tell you different methods. Many people here are hurting but don’t want to see someone else hurt so doubt you’ll get the answers you’re looking for. I hope during your search you find reasons not to. I’m sorry you’re in that place. I’ve been there and I just felt so empty, I do off and on nowadays. Not as bad as it was."
transpassing,fctr38u,t3_eiu4ir,1577955135.0,Looks good on you
Seahawks,fcml4gx,t3_ehyagd,1577779819.0,Woah that’s dope.
depression,fclueji,t3_ehpglc,1577756709.0,Reading that perfectly describes how I feel at my low points. When I’m doubting myself and everything around me. I’ve had to leave work early cause I know i can’t even hold my tears in. I’ve had moments where I’m doing my job and it just starts. Idk why but it overcomes me. Lately I’ve felt better but it hits you when you least expect it at times. I wish you the best.
depression,fclt3hk,t3_ehq2cg,1577755804.0,Good job I felt proud of myself the last time I resisted too. I just slept and slept until the urge passed. And your fish are happier too l!
MtF,fclt0qi,t1_fcl6wb6,1577755749.0,Omg that’s what my brain was thinking but I couldn’t figure it out. I loved that series!
Seahawks,fclqz3f,t3_ehrvpq,1577754336.0,"I get frustrated with some of his decisions but the good outweighs the bad. We’ve had a decade of some pretty awesome football, we’re frustrated that we’re 11-5 and in the playoffs. Like seriously that proves how good we’ve had it. I’m a mariners fan and seeing that shit show always makes me thankful for The coaching staff and front office of the Seahawks.

When I’m older and I’m watching my Seahawks lose 10 games a year I’ll be missing the hell out of Pete Carroll. Good post."
transpassing,fcjfsr1,t1_fchp5de,1577686010.0,I don’t think she looks handsome in the right. I get a more feminine vibe but I guess more clockable? I just know I want OPs hair haha
depression,fcjfnxq,t3_ehg1i8,1577685876.0,"Hang in there. If you have a supportive work environment I would try to handle the anxiety of coming back but if you feel awful at work and feel they are treating you poorly after this i would look elsewhere. I’ve been cuffed and put in the back before, it’s not a great feeling but don’t feel ashamed. You didn’t do anything wrong you’re just struggling."

depression,fcjf3rg,t3_ehg01s,1577685324.0,"Congrats! I’m happy for you. You should hang out again!

And I second everyone else you should be proud of yourself!"
Seahawks,fcjeiuf,t3_ehhh8o,1577684769.0,Hey Marshawn wanna come back next year???? Pleeeease!!!! And while the picture perfect ending didn’t happen I’m still gonna just be grateful I got to see him play again. I won’t forget that and maybe he can have a couple plays against the eagles. I’m not gonna give up on this team! Go hawks
Seahawks,fcjcuv5,t3_ehhni9,1577683293.0,Me too...me too but I can also acknowledge the fact we screwed our selves over quite a few times. Especially with that delay of game at the goal line. Don’t put the game in the hands of the refs cause you can’t trust them to make the right call!!!!!
leaves,fcjcrjq,t3_eheu9j,1577683215.0,And puppies will give you a better high and bond you won’t forget!
Seahawks,fcj4u5k,t3_ehengc,1577677304.0,It happened!!!! Go lynch
