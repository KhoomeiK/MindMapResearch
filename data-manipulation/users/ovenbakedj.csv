SuicideWatch,fc2eu9n,t3_efmx50,1577356128.0,We love every single one of you. Everyone is on here for a similar reason. We can all get through it together and with the help of others. Christmas one year or more may be shit for some. But there is always another year to make it the best you want it to be. People around the globe are starting to understand more about the depressed side of everyone. Hang in there because it will get better.
SuicideWatch,fc2el2z,t1_fc288la,1577355700.0,"Failing is the first step to succeeding. We all know so many people have failed in so many things in life. But all that becomes an experience that makes you better as a person and will lead to your eventual success, whatever it is. 

Keep it going. If you like KFC as an example, colonel sanders struggled for so long before making it. Like many many others.

You'll get there. Don't think its empty words or I'm just trying to cheer you up. I believe in what I say and I hope you can too."
SuicideWatch,fc2edxw,t1_fc1rj9m,1577355361.0,"You can be and you will. Look at all the options that can help you. Talking to people or professionals.  Joining groups like this to share experiences and help each other get through it. If you have anxiety or unable to do these things in person. Start from the easiest position of help and work up to the bigger things.

 For me the start was medication and exercise. After that even with my anxiety and shyness I thought, why not, what do I have to lose knowing I was already at wits end. So I went and talked to people openly about it. A lot of people may not care or understand even if you do try. BUT there are many people like the good kind people on here that know and understand. And they want to help you in whatever way they can. 

Your parents love you. The hardest thing after my attempt was knowing that I would of gone before I could take care of them when they get old. Cherish what you can.

 I know people say it all the time. But give it all you got to make your life the best it can be. The path is slow my friend, but you are on it to becoming better."
SuicideWatch,fc2dt47,t1_fc1i80x,1577354365.0,"It's never going to be easy. But think of how much more worth it is when you come to the next day, and you find that it is a little bit more beautiful than before. Keep it up! I feel my life is only just starting. 

There's so much more days to find a way through it."
SuicideWatch,fc2doml,t1_fc1u821,1577354147.0,"You may think it's hollow words. But I love you. If I could give every person whose had to experience yours, and my pain, the way out of their depression. I would in a heartbeat.

 You are not disgusting. You are not ugly.

Everyone has had, or will have someone they love or care about in their life. There's always another day to find that person. Don't give up. It will always be a hard, slow, gradual road to getting better. But you will make it there in the end."
climatechange,faf3btc,t1_faetwff,1576013649.0,"I do worry about what you say giving your post history and your willingness to link your website on every post. Whether your pro climate change or a denier, it's hard to tell. In this age we need scientifically proven, peer reviewed and concensus driven data and knowledge in order to give our civilization a path forward. Anyone who goes the opposite in that is actively harming and preventing humanity from surviving and co-existing with our planet."
