Adelaide,fferigr,t1_ffer91a,1579861961.0,"The Guardian wrote the story, mate. Take the headline up with them.

No one said the club did wrong by applying for a grant. But it should never have been awarded after its circumstances changed, and arguably not before that either.

The fact it didn't have a women's team when the grant was awarded just shows how flagrantly the government abused the fund. 

That, my curious comrade, is the point you seem to be going to great lengths to miss."

It always makes me curious when people appear to deliberately miss the point.

Would you say Old Collegians deserved this merit based grant considering it wanted to build sheds for non-existent women as part of it?

Perhaps to merit based grant should have gone to a club that actually could and would use the funds for the purposes they described in their application.
