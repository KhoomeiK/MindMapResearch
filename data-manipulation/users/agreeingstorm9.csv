* People who don't submit any qualifying times so they get stuck in the very last corral with everyone who's walking but they want to run.
* People who get pissed at everyone stopping for photo ops or to ride rides
* People who get pissed in general that the races aren't taken seriously enough

If you're in any of those categories you're probably not going to have a good time.  It seems to me that the races are mainly made for Disney people who like to run.  They're not made for runners who enjoy Disney. Not sure if that makes any sense."

todayilearned,ffasdjd,t3_esjv0b,1579743378.0,Do they have things like these for normal people?  I have one foot that's bigger than the other.  I'm told this is perfectly normal.  I'd love to trade one of my shoes for one a half size bigger.
running,ffas2pd,t1_ffacgh0,1579743175.0,Comments like this is why you get downvoted.  Saying that someone running a 20 min 5k is easy newbie gains shits on the fact that most new runners can't come anywhere close to that and most veteran runners bust their asses for those times.
running,ffarx0m,t1_ffadddc,1579743068.0,The largest 5k in town had only 800 participants last year although the previous year it had 1200.  The second largest one has about 600 people.  I get downvoted every time I say this but I live in the US and parkrun isn't a thing at all here so you pay $25-30 to run these races.

news,ffa96se,t1_ff9ptmc,1579730328.0,Gabbard is also a public figure which makes the standard that much higher than if she wasn't.  She has no case and this is 100% a publicity stunt.
running,ffa7v64,t1_ffa4e1h,1579729589.0,I've put in consistent training for a lot longer than 2 mos and never got anywhere close to 24 mins.  Granted I'm 30 lbs overweight but I don't think that if magically lost 30 lbs I could cut 10+ mins off my time.  That would be delusional.  Where I am if you run 24 mins that's a top 20-top 40 finish.  I have no idea why you wouldn't consider that fast.

baseball,ff9vyxp,t1_ff9tz6a,1579722704.0,If they had played at home with the same win percentage as they did on the road they'd have won 97 games which would've tied them with Oakland for the division lead.  I have no idea which one of them had the tiebreaker last year and I'm too lazy to look it up but they still would've been a playoff team.
baseball,ff9r1dk,t1_ff9ps9d,1579719156.0,They cheated at home but not on the road.  Their road record is as good as a lot of the top teams last year.
baseball,ff9p9ve,t1_ff9hdow,1579717866.0,You can make an honest argument that even without the cheating they would've won anyway.  It's not like the team is mediocre and cheated to get over the hump.  It's a damn good team either way.

running,ff9d91g,t1_ff9cmre,1579710451.0,Here it's definitely open but only during regular business hours.  It seems to me that when the staff leave at 5 or whenever they lock up the track as well.  Certainly if you go by on the weekends or after 5 on the weekdays it'll be locked up for sure.  If you by during the summer it's locked up most of the time.  I don't know what hours the school keeps during the summer if any.

running,ff99rkn,t1_ff988xd,1579708091.0,"I'm in the US.  The local high schools never have runners on it who aren't school kids and are locked up at 5pm and not open at all on weekends.  Maybe people go there and run during the week on school days.  I don't know as I'm at work then.  During the summer the schools are all closed and the track is locked up.  I did run there once when I got off work during the school year.  There were a handful of students on the football field but no adults about.  I got very weird looks from everyone.  Maybe I just look more suspicious than you do. 

There is a local college that hosts a running club once a week but when I've gone by there on other days the track is also locked up.  I'm an alum there so maybe I could talk to people to get access to it but it's not worth it when I can go run in the park."
running,ff99hw9,t1_ff98b0z,1579707924.0,A 24 min 5k blows away my best effort by nearly 10 mins.  To me that's incredibly fast.  If they're running 8 min miles as slow miles on a long run then they're probably capable of running around a 20 min or so 5k which is something I'll probably never achieve because I have neither the talent nor dedication.
