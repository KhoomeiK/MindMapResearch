The day a restaurant pays hourly workers above minimum wage should be a national holiday. However coming to work with a people who want to work hard versus people who have to work hard makes a big difference

Also No one new (last 4 years) ever stuck around to qualify for the ESOP, so it really is just the 15-20 of us in Portland.

Summer is always harder because we staff seasonal, college kids that just need the paycheck. Yet I work with people that have been there 7-10 years because they feel like the place is theirs and it balances out

No knock on ^future ^seahawks ^legend Duane Brown, but we can’t run the OL behind him alone. We need protection like Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees have (one can dream, yea?)
