Get a grip you cockwomble."
thedivision,ffenr9q,t3_et76ta,1579856308.0,I don’t think it’s the reason but the term nugget can be used as a derogatory term towards amputees.
aww,ffd58y3,t1_ffd3lml,1579813673.0,He who lives in a glass house shouldn’t throw stones.
Fallout,ff6zmov,t3_er68tm,1579638164.0,"I have about 400+ hours in the game, uninstalled while I wait for Wastelanders as I feel like I have completed basically all there is for me to do outside of legendary farming.

The world itself feels great, the side stories are much better than the main quest line by a long way. In fact some of the best stories available aren’t even tied to any quests whatsoever."

Fallout,ff6z6br,t1_ff50j3d,1579637897.0,"I played the game since a month after release, haven’t felt manipulated into buying any micro-transactions. I’d say over 70% of the items that I acquired have been from atoms that I haven earned through completing the in-game challenges."

Fallout,ff6xwb8,t3_ervnu4,1579637149.0,"I’d be pretty fucking upset if some fresh faced, blue spandex wearing widow/widower just came along and deleted my house from existence."
Games,ff6trp0,t1_ff6lmnb,1579634714.0,I don’t know what bootleg ass fanfics you’ve been reading but “defeating evil” and lovecraftian horror are equivalent to chalk and cheese.
thedivision,ff6jn0l,t1_ff6izef,1579628613.0,"Oh well that’s good to hear, but is it a viable option for running things like the raid? As far as I’m aware most groups are built up of 8 players stacking as much damage as possible."
thedivision,fexukzm,t1_fexuegg,1579436459.0,"Ah okay like I said I’m just going off of what I know from the first game seeing as I’m only about a week into the 2nd one, glad to hear that they’re making their endgame content more of a challenge that requires more prep and coordination."
thedivision,fexphwa,t1_fexozxp,1579434425.0,"Sorry my memory is hazy, I meant incursions."
thedivision,fexop43,t3_eqqltv,1579434158.0,Recently got into Division 2 myself at the start of this week so I haven’t got any raid experience in this game BUT I did do most of the raids on the highest difficulty in Division 1 and if this games raids are anything like that which I’m assuming they are then they’ll mostly be big bullet sponges with not a lot of complexity to them.
elderscrollsonline,fepikhb,t3_eqb5r6,1579321414.0,"Well Nords are the only human EP race so it’s pretty obvious that he’s a Nord, as if the armour and giant beard wasn’t enough of a hint."
reddeadfashion,fek6ruw,t1_fejldjr,1579193786.0,“Did not we not get no new clothes” makes a lot less sense than OP’s title
reddeadfashion,febnkz1,t1_febjo6w,1578960723.0,"Thanks a lot man, took me 4 attempts and a LOT of saved up cash to get him just right. Mainly did it after getting tired of heritage 7 having very large lips that’s can’t be changed unfortunately but I’m very happy with the result."
skyrim,feagexv,t1_fe9t1q0,1578948429.0,It’s like $4-5
reddeadfashion,fe9lklf,t3_eo6ori,1578939163.0,Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
reddeadfashion,fe98v6w,t1_fe98ryj,1578935457.0,Why thank you kindly.

reddeadfashion,fdxd8nm,t1_fdwq3jo,1578767641.0,"Bandito pants might be a good swap, don’t go for any fancy colours though, greens, beige and grey are what you’re after with a bit of red or blue mixed it"
reddeadfashion,fdweerx,t3_en71mp,1578757848.0,Too be fair I think it’d look more accurate if you took the jacket off seeing as the jacket he’s wearing is the same material as the shirt.
DestinyTheGame,fdrgqoc,t3_emts78,1578684288.0,"Last time Xur had Armamentarium was back in July yet he has sold Black Talon TWICE in the space of one month, what a joke."
playblackdesert,fdp0lgs,t1_fdp0hmi,1578617160.0,"Ah okay thanks for that, most of the information about the game is PC focused so I wasn’t 100% sure whether the same applies to console or not. Have fun!"
playblackdesert,fdozq18,t1_fdozlxz,1578616580.0,"You’re missing the point of the question, I’m asking what happens when that first item is listed. Does it just appear the second the person puts it up for sale and it’s first come first serve?"

falloutlore,fcg58mt,t1_fcg0uxl,1577636591.0,"You do realise that FO3 and FO4 are only 10 years apart right? The Brotherhood wiped out almost all of the raiders, mutants etc so the possibility of raiders taking rivet city is highly unlikely especially with it being in walking distance of project purity"
falloutlore,fcfyn3g,t1_fcfyer7,1577634894.0,"I never said they did, but if it was rivet city then I doubt that they would just let the BoS come in and steal their main source of power without any resistance"

falloutlore,fcdvfop,t1_fcdurwm,1577614255.0,"That’s not all we know, it’s explained through dialogue and terminal entries that the Prydwin was constructed in three years out of the remains of the Adams Air Force base mobile crawler. The main reactor that powers the engines, lights, appliances etc is the reactor that comes from rivet city, implying that the BoS straight up stole it by force and left the entire city without a power source."
