>The sticker with the price does not mean much and you know that better than I do - that's why we are negotiating in the first place.

You missed my point. If someone were to try to negotiate the price on the car without running their credit first, the salesperson/dealer/finance isn't going to negotiate. Period. Because it's a waste of time to negotiate for a financed deal without running credit. If you insist on speaking numbers, the response you will get is ""The price is on the sticker on the car. If you want to see if we can maybe help you out a little bit, we'll need to run your credit to see what you qualify for.""

>If we negotiate and you say you will sell me a car for X, you should sell for X, regardless of how I pay for it. Once I pay cash, the bank does not play.

If you're buying a new car, there are mutually exclusive incentives offered by the manufacturer depending on whether or not you are financing or paying cash.  So for example, I have a car that you want. It's sticker price is 30k. The manufacturer has a 3k rebate for cash deals or a 1.9%/60 mo finance offer. You cannot have both. 

I am not obligated to tell you about either deal. It is publicly available information, but I am not obligated to bring it up if you don't know. Besides, you said that you were financing, so that 3k isn't even on the table. Instead, you're just negotiating against what we can allow while still maintaining profitability. So you and I negotiate for finance deal and maybe the lowest we can go for you is 29k. 

You say ""Surprise! I'm paying in cash! You still have to agree to 29k!""

I am sincerely confused and could actually tell you to take a hike if I felt like, but I don't. I just say ""Um, alright, no problem."" And then I proceed with the deal as normal. You know why I do that? Not because I need to do anything for you. But because now we (the dealership) can apply the 3k rebate without you ever knowing about it and we get to keep that 3k. 

If you had negotiated for cash, that 3k would have come into play. Maybe you would have a 27k purchase price.

Not as simple as that. At least in car sales it's not. I'm not sure if you sell cars, but I did several different sales jobs leading up to selling cars and there's a difference. Leads are filtered to whoever is most profitable for the business so they end up not only make more money per sale, but also more sales overall. And more sales overall = higher bonuses, higher salary. So it compounds. 

There are a high percentage of people who come to dealerships who can't afford anything even if they wanted to and they don't want to. They come because cars are cool and they want to see/test drive. If you are a low profitability seller you will be assigned to these people because it keeps the lookie-loos happy and maintains a positive inviting image of the dealership. But it also keeps you away from the serious buyers, and this is very intentional. Because as a Sales Manager, why would I want to allow you to sell cars to this customer at invoice when I can assign your co-worker who will upsell them and make more money not only for their self- but also myself and the Finance department?

Ergo you get the opportunity to play good Samaritan taken away from you.

>If you were actually a good sales person you could even convince them that the cheaper option they can afford is a better buy.

Your definition of a ""good sales person"" is flawed, because the metric by which sales skills are measure is profitability of sales.

That being said, as a general rule, a good car sales person *will* try to convince you to get the cheapest model close to what you're looking for, or at the very least the lowest trim of the model you want. But it's not so that they can save you money. It's because they start by showing you the most stripped down version of what you want so that when you insist on upgrading you have already built up the value of what you want in your mind. This is prepping you for a higher price on the vehicle you actually wanted when you walked in.

That said, as a former car salesman, you are pretty spot on that successful sales people are unscrupulous with a high percentage being straight up sociopathic. One of the reasons I wasn't successful and why I left after a year. I saw what I had to do for success and couldn't stomach it.

The caveat I would add to that is that most car shoppers are equally as bad as the car sellers... the only difference is that the car shoppers buy a car every 3-10 years, and most car sellers sell 3-10 cars a week. So you can guess who is better at playing the game."

That's a stupid justification. Being open to all races and being serious about finding a life partner aren't mutually exclusive.

I've dated different races but the thing is race was never a factor. Personality/compatibility has always been the biggest factor and that has nothing to do with race.

And that's not to suggest looks don't matter either. It's just that beauty also has nothing to do with race."

unpopularopinion,fck9uq7,t1_fck8fpa,1577720439.0,">Kissing on the lips is only inherently sexual in some cultures

You're missing my point. I'm saying that kissing on the lips is inherently sexual by action. Forget about culture for a moment. Humans are the only animals that kiss on the lips. It evolved as a form of foreplay. It's by definition sexual. It's as sexual as rubbing genitals.

On the topic of cultures, some cultures may have *desexualized* it. Another way of phrasing it would be to say that cultures have normalized it as a non-sexual act. But in the same way, you could argue that one may rub their baby's genitals to calm their babies. Nothing sexual about it pervert! Still, you view it as completely different due to your cultural perception. The biomechanics behind both actions are the same regardless of opinion. Setting aside opinion, you are stimulating arousal when you rub genitals and when you kiss on the lips.

>Additionally the whole hormone exchange thing occurs through saliva.

There is always trace saliva on your mouth. That goes doubly so for infants and toddlers, who are frequently slobbery/drooling. Because we're discussing the transfer on hormones, it only takes trace amounts.

Sorry that your link does not address the point of whether or not kissing evolves as a way of stimulating arousal.  Your link simply addresses whether or not cultures view/participate in kissing. In fact, the article cites that several cultures view it as gross/*too intimate/unhygienic*. Which I already knew. But that hardly makes the point that kissing is something you should do to children.

Again, missing the point. Cultures can define ""sexual"" any way they want. The biomechanics remain the same."

So has pedophilia.

I think the argument against kissing on the mouth is that it is by default a sexual act because kissing is a way of sharing sex hormones between the sexes. IOW: it gets people turnt up. And that's why we started kissing somewhere along the evolutionary line. It's a way to cause arousal and also a way to check for mate compatibility. It's foreplay.

So rubbing lips is by default sexual in the same way that rubbing genitals is by default sexual. If you want to say that you can kiss on the mouth without it having a sexual component based on your intentions, then you can say that you can rub your child's crotch without it being sexual based on your mindset/intentions.

So the real cultural taboo is incest and molestation. I would argue that kissing your child on the mouth regardless of culture is a (minor) form of incestuous molestation. And based on science, I'd be right. Is that acceptable? Put in those terms, it's not, to most people.  But people will justify things based on cultural norms. Like how it's okay in some cultures to take prepubescent spouses."
