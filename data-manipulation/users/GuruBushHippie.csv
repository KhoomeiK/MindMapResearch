ThatsInsane,ffcn2ka,t1_ffcl5e9,1579802948.0,"You said it yourself, it’s an ownership problem. Saying “huskies are assholes” is a damaging generalization just as bad as calling pit bulls vicious. Most huskies I’ve met are owned by people who are prepared for and know the breed. With the ones I’ve see that misbehave I had to look no further than the owner. Mine are so well behaved that they’re the dogs we use to properly socialize working sled dog pups."

ThatsInsane,ffchn6k,t1_ffchcux,1579799660.0,"When did I say that? If my dog is making another one uncomfortable I call them to me, not spike them in the mouth. A dog running around with spikes on their neck is a threat to any dog it plays with."

ThatsInsane,ffc6m74,t1_ffba3d3,1579792744.0,"They’re not assholes, it’s just how they play. Huskies and Malamutes are among 13 or so basal breeds meaning they’re a bit more closely related to wolves than divergent breeds. They’re just mouthy, robust dogs and this is reflected in their play style. When huskies decide it’s no longer playtime they’re going to go after the face and belly. I’ve seen ears bitten off, eyes taken out, tails removed, disembowelment... never seen a husky kill another via neck bite though."
ThatsInsane,ffc64fd,t1_ffbm7du,1579792418.0,A wolf collar has spikes on it. If you get my dog spiked in the mouth for trying to play we’re gonna have a conversation about it.

dogswithjobs,fcvk6vy,t1_fcvawby,1578003849.0,The ones with booties are either healing a foot injury or are prone to them. We do daily foot checks and work accordingly. As far as brands go we buy cheap. Those cost about $2 a piece from most suppliers. if you google “dog sled booties” you’ll find them.

dogswithjobs,fcu9vry,t1_fcu9ijm,1577976000.0,"Daily foot checks. We’ve had some pretty cold days here lately so the colder snow can be a bit more abrasive. Any dog wearing booties either has minor foot injuries or is prone to getting them. More of the later, but the few with current injuries get treated with a homemade balm that works with the bootie to heal the injury while they’re still running and staying conditioned.
