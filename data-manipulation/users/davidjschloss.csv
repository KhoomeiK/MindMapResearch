I did 14th street all the way through the last light at 57th the other day. My wife and I used to call it “light surfing” when we’d catch this. 

Problem is people going above the speed limit and getting to a red light and stopping right before it turns and the cars behind back up. Pedestrians, delivery vehicles, illegally parked cars and busses screw up most of the rest of manhattan."

Although when you’re getting a lot of depth of field (the amount of the subject in focus) you need a lot more like than you’d think.

Abuse of power is abuse of power. Sure it’s a small abuse of power but it’s till a violation of the law and a violation of the judge’s oath. 

No one says “sure I was driving without a license but that’s as insignificant a charge as they come.” 

Judges are elected officials and they’re supposed to uphold the law. They’re held to a higher standard by their oath and by the law.

Customers weren’t sitting around saying “man I wish this brick was recycled” but they’re doing it anyhow. Their R&D will have massive effects on the industry. 

Coke arguable produces way more plastic per year, and it’s used for seconds, vs LEGO which can last generations. 

Coke could use its resources to make a new solution and they could probably make more licensing that solution than they make on drinks (well that’s probably hyperbole) but they are unwilling because plastic is cheap and the cost of the use of it is passed on to consumers and to their municipalities."

And that when you put PLA into the regular stream it degrades it. 

We went back to plastic cups for cold beverages, because at least they’d have a chance of getting recycled. I’d have been happy to use an option that didn’t cause more harm than good."

First you find out that big Pharma is bad, and you buy into the idea that vaccines cause autism, but big Pharma covers it up. The ""autism doesn't come from immunizations"" is hard to disprove, since so many people with autism had vaccines as kids, and autism is usually diagnosed when there are developmental milestones missed.

You get that some things work, we've all taken aspirin or zinc or whatever. So medicine isn't bad, just medicine that's from Big Pharma.   


You sell the natrualpath as an alternative to money-driven treatment, but one that uses what's abundant in nature. So you play on the ""I need a cure"" part of a person's emotions, and fill it with ""I have that cure, and it's not from Pfizer.""
