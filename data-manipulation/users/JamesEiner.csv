You can turn off the watermark in the camera settings... Just open the camera and search for the settings-button (it might be hidden in some sort of menu that you have to open first) and then look for the option to disable the watermark! :DD

I them decided to open it up with the tools I got from an SSD install kit.

It appears that one of the Shields for the E/A ribbon cable has popped off (as seen in the image).

It should technically be looking like [this](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesEiner/comments/eo8cw4/image_of_how_it_should_be_looking/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

The [piece itself](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesEiner/comments/eo7o6i/image_of_the_separated_piece_top/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) seems to have come off completely, as the screws are still in place and the [bottom of it](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesEiner/comments/eo7ocg/image_of_the_separated_piece_bottom/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) looks like the things that the screws go into were glued to the motherboard and just came off...

I hope I did the right move by screwing the MacBook open, because the metal shielding could have just rattled around there causing all sorts of damage, right?!

Is it safe to just close the MacBook back up again or do these Shields serve a bigger purpose than keeping the cables tight?!

Should I just glue the thingies that hold the screws back on again?!

Please help!!!"
