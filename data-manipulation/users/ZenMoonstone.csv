Marriage,ffjtfdl,t1_ffjlwgv,1580006458.0,I wish the same for you.  Is there something I can do to help?
Marriage,ffie17w,t3_ett0ac,1579971634.0,That’s awesome.  Glad y’all are doing well now..That’s a very thoughtful gift and something you will treasure forever..
NewOrleans,ffibx3d,t3_etqr2q,1579970207.0,"I want to see it but I also don’t.  I’m sure I will though. 

One night I tried to go to Jack Dempsey’s and it was closed because they were filming a movie across the street.  I wonder if this was the movie?"

Her reason is valid and I feel like maybe you are torn between what your partner wants and what your mom wants."

Glad you had a good day.  Hopefully it will build momentum."

MadeMeSmile,ff91eu4,t3_es7z7e,1579702427.0,"Shortly after the hurricane Katrina my aunt took in a mom and eight puppies because they would have just been put to sleep. I wouldn’t recommend it.
She has taken tremendously good care of them but it has taken a toll on her.  All she does is work around the clock caring for them and now they are old with health problems. Her vet and food bills are outrageous and she has been on one vacation in 13 years, like other than that one trip she hasn’t been away from home for one night. 3 have passed away in the last two years. There’s a special place in heaven for her that’s for sure."
iamveryugly,ff87ss3,t3_es05t7,1579668461.0,"Reminds me of one day after school I took my son,who at the time was in first grade, to get ice cream. He ran into one of the girls in his class who was quite precocious. She was climbing all over the place, singing and basically being a pita when she looks at my son and says, “I really like you but I know you don’t like me.  You think I’m annoying.”
He looked right at her and said, “You are and I think it in my head all the time I’ve just never said it out loud.”

She’s in her twenties now and knock-out gorgeous. I hear she is still annoying though."

AskNOLA,ff0vzzt,t3_er12ck,1579472795.0,Deanie’s on Magazine had them last week. I’d call and check. It was delicious.
AskNOLA,ff0tn3q,t3_er2out,1579472174.0,"I’d try to stay in Metairie over Harvey. 
For Endymion I would recommend getting out to the parade ground early and setting up some chairs, and basically staking out a spot.  If you go near St. John’s Lutheran near Canal and Carrollton there will be places to walk up to get food and use the bathroom. 

Parades routes are like giant tail gates. Get a spot and plan to spend the day enjoying your family and watching the crowds. It is really family friendly and a lot of fun."
