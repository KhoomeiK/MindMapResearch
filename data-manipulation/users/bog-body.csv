lanadelrey,ffrlo3m,t1_ffrkr5q,1580160601.0,"We all know radio play doesn't equal good music or else she would have gotten her Grammy by now. Unfortunately, radio play means much more than quality at the Grammys, and has for decades. Do I think Father of the Bride was better than NFR? No. But Billie Eilish got 2 Grammys over Lizzo this year and it just goes to show how little the Grammy voters care about quality and complexity."
lanadelrey,ffrk4c2,t1_ffrgeu9,1580159664.0,Songs from Father of the Bride were on the radio MUCH more than NFR and it probably would have won from popularity alone. They would have been about neck and neck.

ptsd,ffclp7h,t3_esvlzf,1579802117.0,"I'm really sorry that you're going through this! You're not alone, and you're not weak. Your therapist is basically telling you that they're not educated enough for you, not that you're weak. You don't necessarily need someone who does EMDR. You need someone who works with trauma. I've done EMDR and it ended up retraumatizing me with certain memories. Now I'm doing internal family systems (IFS) therapy and it's helped a lot more. (Not trying to say EMDR is bad, it just didn't work for me, and it's not the only option out there.). What I suggest doing is researching different kinds of trauma therapies and finding one you think would work best for you. Then, you can start looking for therapists that can do these therapies and really work with you. Good luck!"
