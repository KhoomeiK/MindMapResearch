unpopularopinion,ffwlb8b,t1_ffwjhjt,1580304574.0,"Great. but you realize they have to know how to read text and graphics, and be able to analyze them?  Like the same exact skills they always needed to be taught, even before computers.  The assumption that young children will learn how to critically analyze just by plopping them in front of a laptop has greatly lowered critical thinking.  Not saying that’s what you are promoting, but rather that de-emphasis of basic skills for young people doesn’t help the goal of critical thinking.  Couple that with “But Johnny doesn’t like to read however you must give him an A”. the cry of many American parents, caved in to by lazy administrators, is the bane of teachers and has led to the rise of pseudoscience imo."

unpopularopinion,ffwkqr4,t1_ffwjslf,1580304105.0,"I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but critical thinking requires knowledge of facts before analyzing and evaluating them.  Due to a combination of uninformed and lazy parenting, economics where both parents have to work and school budgets are decimated , politics, spineless school administrators, and the self-esteem movement (which only ever existed in the current US where every kid gets a trophy) kids don’t even learn many basic skills and facts any more.  Forget critical thinking, they don’t even get THINKING anymore.  The first step to controlling the masses is making sure they are not educated."

Why didn’t your imaginary caring altruistic CEOs stop those things?  It wasn’t CEOs that stopped those and other atrocities, but CEOs sure did profit from them.  Regulation solved those problems.  History shows again and again that most of the wealthy care about nothing but their wealth and they will destroy anything to get more wealth.  Thank God for our regulations which prevent them from doing so.  Environmental protection and the economy CAN work together, but not in a way that maximizes profit at all costs to anything else (the way most corporations operate) and not without regulation."
