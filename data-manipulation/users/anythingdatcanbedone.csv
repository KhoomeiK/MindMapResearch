You just drive in between those and vaguely on your side."

So smooth it's like you're rolling on butter. So smooth my chair rolls across the room in my home office because the floor is not level.

Now I have to build a new house because my chair is used to a higher standard of living. You could say it's now, a high roller."

One time we locked out keys in the engine right in the middle of town, and one of them shimmed the door open. He became the town locksmith for the summer.  People would call us to have him come unlock their car doors."

It was stated that he was given options and killing Soleimani was something they put on the table as drastic and they thought he wouldn't choose to do it and he choose to do it to their shock.

That tells you that there was absolutely no threat.  He chose a drastic option because he's a little cry man."

AskReddit,fdnvacq,t3_ejr5rg,1578593558.0,"I used to run a beer club for women in my previous city. I started it with one other friend and brought four more friends and acquaintances on to help run it. 

Over four years, we quadrupled our growth and everybody was enjoying the events. But the people who helped plan the events with me started to become incredibly difficult. Some would not help at all and only show up for the party, others would talk smack about the other ones and then be friendly to their faces. Eventually I realized that our friendships were suffering, if not ruined completely because of the club (and how disappointed I was in how little they seemed to care about it). I picked up and moved a few states away, then two others did too. Now it's dead.

The lesson I learned is that it will only work when you bring people on to be partners who will actually give a shit and put in good effort. For the most part, nobody cared about it as much as I did and I had to kill it or it would turn into something stupid and lame and different than everything I wanted it to be."
