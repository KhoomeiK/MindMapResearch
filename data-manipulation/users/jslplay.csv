Motivate yourself by *knowing* that once you have a stable income from a job in your field, you will be able to move out. You will have enough money.

I am also desperate for a ""social life"" and to live alone. I feel that I will only be able to move out once I have a job. But for now, I am **thankful** to my parents for letting me live with them, for their delicious home cooked meals, for not having to deal with the ""adult"" world yet. All I'm primarily expected of is to study hard.

I'm just grinding through the remaining years of college until independence (moving out) becomes visible. I need to first find a job in my degree area. For me, I feel that will be the first step towards independence and actually being seen as an adult. 

I'm 19 also. I commute on a train daily for \~45 minutes to my university also. My parents are immigrants from Russia to the US, so I understand the whole immigrant parents/helicopter mentality."
