However; my point still stands, there’s no risk of infection from dried semen.

pics,ffbf2sq,t1_ffa2axb,1579762522.0,Cameras like the Sony A7S series can shoot at incredibly high iso without becoming overly grainy. So you can do night photography without compromising shutter speed with a fast lens.
classicwow,ff8obne,t1_ff8ne0e,1579688686.0,"I think I tuned in exactly when you did. I like to have a stream going while I play; but lately there just aren’t any interesting Classic streams, and even the ones that exist don’t really do it for me :(

Wish there was a separate category on Twitch that separated retail from classic.

But ya, tuned into him drinking through a sock, pouring water all over himself, bopping up and down relentlessly to some EDM. I thought he must be on drugs."
classicwow,ff8dkcx,t1_ff8cw4v,1579674037.0,I believe it is a wet sock.
confessions,ff7iqwt,t3_ervkag,1579650504.0,"I get like this too. But sometimes it’s amazing how much of a difference showering and shampooing then making a cup of coffee or tea and eating a piece of fruit changes my entire mental state in the morning. I’m like automatically more productive and then when I chill I don’t feel guilty about it because I earned it. Instead of days where I’m out of bed at 2pm, and play video games in my PJs; then I feel like shit."
classicwow,ff7fqch,t1_ff73bx4,1579648506.0,"Ya I see a lot of that going around. I also see people who got all the great Bis stuff off lists they found online but are still weak dps.

This go around I’m in my 30s and have a lot less ability to commit, so I hit 60 a few weeks ago and I’m just having fun as a prot warrior tanking ubrs and dungeons. Not sure I’ll ever raid classic really : (

But the hardest part about 40 mans has always been getting 40 people to pay attention, read the strategy, and don’t stand in fire. That one boss in TBC sun temple place where the boss throws giant lightning balls VERY SLOWLY that air on impact I used to get so frustrated because wipes were literally do to people not moving away,

It’s like the Austin powers scene were the cement roller is coming at the guy from really far away and he doesn’t move.


That being said, BWL is mechanically harder / more fun than MC. But not so much harder that anyone who actively plays the game won’t be able to do it after a few vael wipes."

As a NE, that’s what I want but I doubt I’ll get the rep. Sitting around 600g now, taking it slow as well. Also, I’m a warrior so my best gold comes from Strat Live orbs."
classicwow,ff5k9u8,t1_ff4tdj5,1579596906.0,"I played in a casual raiding guild in vanilla where half the players barely knew the mechanics and only paid partial attention. We still had BWL on farm and got most of the way through AQ40. I think people will be surprised how easy it is.


This reminds me about how pre-classic launch everyone on reddit was saying how hard classic is. And I kept thinking (un-arrogantly) that I really don’t remember it being hard at all, the leveling, the dungeons, the raids. I fucking love the game but it’s not hard.

Now everybody talks about how easy everything is. 

BWL will be no different. If anything at all, Naxx will be a gear check. But AQ40 dps gear is bonkers."

IAmA,fed9663,t1_febjxvb,1579004336.0,"I read here several months ago an interesting take on the different levels of wealth and there aren’t that many. You get to a point where you can afford any home, toy or vacation you want pretty early on in the billionaire scale. But once you are a billionaire / multi billionaire you start trying to change the world to be how you view “better”. Generally by investing politically. And it’s not uncommon to have lunch / dinner with governors and presidents who will take your opinion into consideration. 500 mil doesn’t get you that kind of power."
