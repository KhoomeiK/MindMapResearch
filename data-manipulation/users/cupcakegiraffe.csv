ShitPostCrusaders,ff8axaw,t3_es39cb,1579671325.0,I just wanted to tell you that your drawings make my day. They look really fun to draw! :)
AnimalCrossing,ff545np,t1_ff4v46k,1579579725.0,I actually prefer the nice villagers. The game for me is to relax and spend my free time and I ain’t got time for some meano grumpster.
aww,ff1ynoj,t1_ff1wty8,1579489214.0,"Yeah, but they can’t make more Grumpy Cat Christmas movies or cat chow endorsements! That’s one reason why I thought it was in such poor taste. It showed that all they truly cared about was the money and attention the cat brought them."
aww,ff1yi6y,t1_ff1x3qz,1579489109.0,"Yeah, her face is grumpy, but you can see videos of her meet and greets and she often will put her ears back in annoyance."
aww,ff1wlhg,t1_ff1w3qi,1579487834.0,The cat looked very uncomfortable in all of the meet and greet pictures I’ve seen.
aww,ff1tp69,t1_ff1t90s,1579485955.0,"Pet exploitation is rampant on social media, though. Just look at the poor Grumpy Cat. Immediately after she died, the owners were complaining they lost a lot of income. That wasn’t surprising, but still messed up.

Edit: I would definitely say that Grumpy Cat was exploited. The quick announcement after her death about how much they’re gonna miss the money was in extremely poor taste and it’s disgusting that owners will continue to put their animals through the stress of travel and large crowds to make a buck. It isn’t fair to the animal when they clearly look uncomfortable in that setting. At that point, your animal is not a beloved pet, but a paycheck."

splatoon,fetqw5w,t1_fetprej,1579378558.0,"Yeah, but I rarely use the phone app. I’ll keep that in mind for the next time, if it’s really bad."
ICanDrawThat,fetq2wo,t3_eqg7bu,1579378242.0,"Would you please draw Poppypaw, a forest gnome (1 ft 10 in) with short, blue hair (think Sailor Mercury)? She’s got pep and a leather jacket with a bejeweled poppy on the back. She’s a cartographer, monster slayer, and a hero of the people. 

If you don’t get to mine, thank you for the offer. Your stuff looks good. :)"
splatoon,fetogw0,t1_fes0kdw,1579377617.0,I think they meant it for rage quitters. They are bad sports and would likely balk at the consequences for continued abuse of disconnection.
nonononoyes,fetnvp3,t1_fesvatq,1579377376.0,There’d be a lot more dead animals because human intervention is a death sentence for some animals.
nonononoyes,fetncdg,t1_fert4fy,1579377158.0,"That’s not respectable behavior. Leaving the hook in the shark and leaving it be would.l have been respectable. These guys just wanted to have some life experience, not help the shark."

LearnJapanese,fdxeowp,t1_fdx80nt,1578768033.0,"Yes, however, I believe that my opinion would be reflected in a lot of other potential users of your app. It is a reasonable request to have a purchase option with no ads. It is true that ads fund a lot of apps these days, but the user experience is greatly reduced when you’re trying to learn something new and are berated by consumerism.

Your response was basically,

>You will be harassed by ads if you don’t learn quickly enough. There will be no purchase option, so deal with it or move on.

I will not be using your app due to this interaction, but there are other potential users you can gain with a purchase option. That’s just my two cents."
LearnJapanese,fdx5r6k,t1_fdwnitz,1578765573.0,I disagree.
LearnJapanese,fdwlic3,t1_fdqza37,1578759887.0,That doesn’t sound good. I’d rather pay for an app flat out than to be bombarded by ads because I’m making mistakes in learning something new. It would actually prevent me from using your product after so many fails.

My favorite villager (she gave me her picture 3 times lol) moved on when I had a hiatus from the game, but she sent me a nice letter thanking me for being her friend. That was a nice touch. 

I found myself visiting the island, too, like you did. I liked to listen to Kap’n sing and the water moving just to chill out, sometimes."
