AskReddit,fd66l7t,t3_ek582o,1578186263.0,"Good with conversation and use of grammar. Also, how they react to your pets. I have a cat and when certain types of people brag about how much they want to kill cats, it scares me."
AskReddit,fd664gs,t3_ek58ah,1578186053.0,"Either a sandwich or sushi because of the variety of ingredients, especially with sandwiches. Just put anything between two slices of bread or in some seaweed and rice and that’s a meal right there."

AskReddit,fd6525o,t3_ek59gn,1578185633.0,I feel like some of my family are fakes and are secretly bitchy to each other. I know one of them probably doesn’t like me because I swear a lot and post more mature content on Facebook. I haven’t seen her face to face in a long time. She didn’t go to the Easter party last year or the Christmas party the year before (there wasn’t a Christmas party this year.)

The doctor was trying to perform a minor surgery for ingrown toenails but didn’t numb the skin before injecting my big toes with the local anesthetic. I say toes because I’ve had three of these surgeries.
AskReddit,fd62but,t1_fd623sb,1578184582.0,"Let me try to clarify. When I said I’d rather be asked, I didn’t mean for people to ask me now. But I would much prefer being asked to having something forced on me."

starterpacks,fctlauu,t1_fcthqaq,1577947494.0,"Same! Well, sorta. I had a couple beers and a couple sips of other stuff but it only made me tipsy. I woke up feeling mildly dehydrated but not pain or sickness so I call that a win!"
