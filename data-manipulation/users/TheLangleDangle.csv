The healthcare and health services systems will be overwhelmed by all of the people that can suddenly go for every single little tiny ache and pain.

Point number two, affordability. Let me reframe it for you. You are buying an experience. You are buying memories and stories and time. What value do those things have to you? When you consider that these experiences and memories last a lifetime then that value increases more. That’s how I explain it to myself anyway. I’ve pretty much stopped buying my kids material objects for birthdays and christmas etc, now I spend my money on experiences that grow them."
