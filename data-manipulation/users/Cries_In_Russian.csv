AskReddit,ff505vm,t3_erolw4,1579576704.0,"That’s a difficult question- I wouldn’t know how big of impact it may have had and I don’t want to change big things like my bf or pet bearded dragon 

I’d probably have it be that I completed any and all homework I didn’t do this weekend so I can actually relax cause I have big projects for hw"
MensRights,ff4wtdv,t3_er9k8a,1579574339.0,"Being a girl myself it’s so extremely depressing to see people this ignorant and self centered. The fact that it isn’t his child is her fault not his. He had little to no control over who fathered the child if she decided to go and fuck someone else too. Imagine being in that much emotional pain and having someone who you loved and trusted not only break you heart but then cheer about it when you’re told in front of a court. That makes me sad, I wish more women understood that equality goes both ways. I legit cried seeing that guy so completely heartbroken and crying like I want to give him a hug and a soft cookie"
