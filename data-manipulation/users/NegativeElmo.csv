AskReddit,ffcswfu,t3_esxnx9,1579806590.0,There is a big difference between all 3 of those. I mostly play on R6 and the main source of toxicity will be playing ez ops or spawn peeking. There can be vocal/written toxicity but at least for me and the people I play with it makes the game more fun. Of course there is a big difference between healthy levels of toxicity and being mean to people. The line depends on the game and community. It’s hard to have a universal understanding of what is ok and what isn’t when there are so many different games and communities out there.
