An older man dating a younger woman is okay, but an older woman dating a younger man is not. The guests where a 50+ year old woman who was with a 20-something male."
todayilearned,ffk92bu,t1_ffjxpq6,1580018968.0,I was actually in the audience of a Dr.Phil show filming once. Can confirm.

JeepGladiator,fffh92o,t1_ffef39y,1579883917.0,Probably don’t need windows then.
JeepGladiator,fffh6gh,t1_fffa330,1579883872.0,"Nice. So for multiple bodies, do you recommend they are stacked in an X pattern?"
JeepGladiator,ffecge0,t3_et53jw,1579843036.0,Really nice. Love how info their is on the product too... but it’s funny that you can order windows on the topper “in case you want to sleep in the bed of your Gladiator.” How is that even possible in a 5’ bed? Am I missing something?

IceFishing,fdcbfx6,t1_fdcatjk,1578270935.0,"I love it and have no major complaints. It's a longer wheelbase and rides like a truck... totally different suspension set up. That being said, you can get high centered more easily if you're rock crawling. But I'm not going to be doing that where I live anyway... for me it's all about getting to those hard to reach hunting/fishing spots. Take one for a test rip."

JeepGladiator,fdc0z6n,t1_fdbuwuk,1578264996.0,Buddy Heater. Most people connect them to 1lb tanks... but you have to change them every few hours. Luckily you can rig up a 20lb with a regulator/hose attachment.
IceFishing,fd73t5k,t1_fd6cwt2,1578199071.0,"The only tip I really have is to find a lake that is notorious for perch. There’s only a couple near where I am, that are known for “good” perch fishing, but you’d still be nowhere near the 30 fish limit. We lucked out a bit today too I think. Sorry I couldn’t be more helpful!"

camping,fc6rm6k,t1_fc3mqj1,1577487709.0,"Pretty much! We have those too... but Beaver Tail is an actual store franchise. And you can get them loaded with things like ice cream, reeses pieces, strawberries, etc. Not really my cup of tea tbh. But the Banff store is usually lined up out the door with tourists come summer."
