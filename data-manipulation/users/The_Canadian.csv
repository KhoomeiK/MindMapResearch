electricians,fg7fu0h,t1_fg6n8ww,1580591473.0,"Disclaimer: I'm not an electrician, but this is what I've noticed in a variety of manufacturing facilities.

Depending on the application, metal pipe/tube does a better job of protecting the wires, particularly in industrial settings. Metal pipes also tolerating more extreme temperatures. 

I was at a tomato processing facility last week and they had quite a lot of PVC conduit outside. Compared the the other metal conduit, it sagged and generally didn't hold up as well. Mind you, they should have supported it better. 

For industrial electrical work, it really depends on the intended environment. PVC is great for underground, or some exterior work, especially around corrosive chemicals. Anything in a production area will either be galvanized, PVC-coated steel (also called Robroy), or stainless steel conduit. Of those, galvanized is the cheapest, but also isn't ideal for washdown areas with a lot of water and cleaning, like you find in a food plant. Stainless is great, but expensive. PVC coated steel is a good balance. 

In industrial settings, even thin-walled EMT is rare because of the requirement for impact protection. Threaded pipe is the norm. EMT gets used a lot in office areas, attics, or other areas where protection is important, but the risk of damage is less likely. One soup facility I've worked in used rigid pipe up through the ceiling, then EMT after that point. Worked well and saved money. 

Commercial is less heavily-built than industrial, but EMT or similar is used commonly. 

In short, it mostly seems to come down to code and general requirements for conduit material selection."

aviation,ffysp9x,t1_ffxeem4,1580354184.0,"Not quite. The flaps extend to increase wing area on landing and takeoff, when you need more lift. As speeds increase, you need less wing area for the same lift, so the wings sweep back to create less drag. The horizontal stabilizers (on the tail) do change angles to move the nose up or down (generally-speaking)."

Of all the days to hit the damn sea wall at SFO, they hit it when the weather was actually good, for once.
