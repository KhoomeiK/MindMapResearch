pathofexile,ff7uqbv,t3_es3lqq,1579658825.0,"I see that you are trying ur very best to improve our trading system to prevent people from getting scammed. But the thing is I think even with this system implemented. People still gonna get scam no matter what because we as players already get used to doing small trades like 20-30 chaos trade which we just hover over and accept immediately.

Edit: I think a very good example is Warframe. Not sure how many here played it but to make it simple to explain is that people used to get scam very frequently when trading just like whats happening in PoE rn. And then they implemented new things into trading like hovering over to confirm, 5 secs delay if trading partner change the item, Messages at the bottom to show that the trader put in items in a set (a game mechanic in warframe where people need a set of item to get a piece of gear), even a five secs confirmation message to ask you if the items the other person put in is really what u want. But people still get scammed."

pathofexile,fe7vmqz,t1_fe1gfhv,1578919691.0,Ive leveled the character to mapping now. It works but I think it is too much investment to get 75% spell damage. A rare shield would give much more damage. Even tho it said max block when you haven't been hit recently. I still get damaged quite frequently even tho I have max dodge

pathofexile,fcn3l6z,t1_fcn2o1v,1577802317.0,20ex is just what I price checked. I craft most of the gears myself. Mostly from my quiver. That I manage to hit T1 fire damage over time multiplier and a T2 damage over time multiplier. 86life and craft elemental damage with attack on it. There was only 1 quiver like this on the market when I got it. Which was 15ex.
