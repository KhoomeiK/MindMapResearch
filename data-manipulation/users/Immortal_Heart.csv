Would a little ""genociding"" of people trying to colonise America have been better than what eventually happened to the native Americans?"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdwofmk,t1_fdtjhkf,1578760839.0,Do you believe that? What if I told you there was an alien (I mean space alien) race that would stop at nothing to exterminate other forms of sentient life. Would genocide be bad then? Because as I see it you'd basically have two options. The first is to kill them all and the second is to nuke them all and keep them in the stone age on their planet so that they can never leave and become a threat to others.

worldnews,fdwkjul,t1_fdwjge3,1578759687.0,"I could be wrong but I thought Taiwan only came under China's control during the Qing dynasty. I've also been told by Taiwanese that Qing controlled less than half of Taiwan. And while some Chinese had lived for a long time it was the KMT and their supporters fleeing the mainland that had a significant impact on the demographics of Taiwan.

As I say I'm not an expert of Chinese history so it may be that Taiwan payed tribute as a vassal long before the Qing took direct control, but that's a dangerous argument because that would give China legitimate claims over the Korean peninsula. Hell, Sri Lanka paid tribute to China for a brief period."
Grimdank,fdwgs4n,t1_fdv2q1e,1578758507.0,"Yes and no. Many Jedi only have rudimentary abilities in many areas. Force healing for example is apparently a rare skill, or at least the Jedi who can do it well are not common. I'm also not sure how limited Librarians are in 40K lore. It's likely that they are stronger in certain areas but that doesn't automatically mean they have no ability in other areas. And some areas have fairly wide application. Biomancers can heal but they can also cause your body to fail or apparently generate insane amounts of bio-electricity so they can throw lightning your way."
Grimdank,fdwfwbn,t1_fdty31h,1578758237.0,"It's hard to say, both universes have (certainly in EU) extremely powerful users who can create force storms or psychic powers that can destroy planets. Some psykers can also see into the future although the Eldar are most famous for it. And in fact they seem to be better at predicting the future than Jedi who often seem to lack control of their premonitions. But one sign that someone might be a latent psyker is if they are unnaturally lucky. Always seem to dodge the right way without knowing it. I don't know if the force has more uses than warp powered psykers have use for the warp.

And while exploding can be a pain that could be a bigger problem for the Star Wars universe were they don't have experience fighting daemons. 40K psyker creates a pathway for daemons to manifest and suddenly Chaos is corrupting the inhabitants of the Star Wars galaxy who may not have any defences against Chaos.

I also argued that warp jumps could be used offensively against the navies of Star Wars are they temporarily rip open gaps between real space and warp space. Get a ship into the middle of a fleet and open up a warp rift in the middle of a load of ships that don't have gellar fields."

Except I was right. You keep making assertions that I am wrong but you've never actually proved your assertion.

You aren't willing to admit you're ignorant about some things, so again I've made a correct assertion. I'm sure there are some things you're willing to claim ignorance of but that's not really relevant right now.

Just because you say something doesn't make it true. You may say I've displayed ignorance and you have not but that doesn't make it true. I have supported what I have said and you may not agree with me but I've supported it. You have never supported what you've said. You've just said I'm wrong. And that's why we end up in this endless loop. You can't win an argument if you have no point. If you have a point state it clearly. If you don't things will just repeat.

Damnthatsinteresting,fdq4l21,t1_fdq3mw8,1578654563.0,"Swords were never a primary weapon for most people in Japan (at least in a battlefield context). I'm still not convinced its function was due to people ditching armour. Yes, gunpowder weapons came to Japan around the same time but had a minimal use and impact for a long time. And armour continued to be worn for an even longer time. I feel the Katana is an evolution of the Tachi but one that is better suited for infantry (although still as a side arm) as it's better for enclosed spaces while the Tachi is better suited as a cavalry weapon.

There are some similarities in use outside of battle. Swords being a badge of nobility (or at least wealth) and being worn during day to day life occasions where one might not be wearing armour. And in fact a lot of the surviving schools of Japanese swordsmanship are just that, duelling schools. That being said they still tend to teach attacks to areas that would be unarmoured or at least weaker areas of yoroi. So I'd have to wonder why they'd bother teaching that if armour had been ditched by the time a lot of these schools started developing."

I don't really care what you have to say because I'm right and you've so far failed to say anything to disprove what I've said or to strongly support your view.

If you aren't willing to admit you're wrong, and ignorant about some things, and grow and improve as a person I don't care. Your personal growth isn't an issue I'm concerned with although I'm sure a therapist would be very beneficial in that regard."
Damnthatsinteresting,fdq34ty,t1_fdp00ks,1578652544.0,"I mean humans can certainly make inferences based off incomplete data. I guess the real question is are they ""reasonable"". So we need to define ""reasonable"". Also, some humans may be able to do so but it's possible that not all humans will be able to do so. Or a human who can make reasonable inferences in one situation will be unable to in another.

I'm actually fairly confident in stating that some humans can make reasonable inferences some of the time based on incomplete data."

Of course there are unproven things which are also untrue, at least as far as we know."
Damnthatsinteresting,fdq2nyg,t1_fdo6p9u,1578651884.0,"But people who actually know about swords can also tell you why some of the others failed. There are clear signs that their technique needs work. Many of them were off balance which means they can't effectively direct power through their entire body (where the power for the cut comes from). You also have the guy who bounced off because his blade wasn't aligned with his cut. To be fair there were 1 or 2 who made good cuts although I wouldn't say they were as good, and I make this judgement just on watching the swordsmen without even having to pay attention to how well they did cutting the mats."
Damnthatsinteresting,fdq2jpt,t1_fdphgu7,1578651715.0,"No shit, nobody is saying the master would cut through the mats with his Ki energy if he didn't have a sword. Of course the sword you have matters. A rapier also wouldn't slice all of those mats in half."
Damnthatsinteresting,fdq2fl1,t1_fdnya3z,1578651555.0,Part of being a master is knowing which tool to use for a job. Also a couple of the others made decent cuts but some of them also made cuts that were clearly inferior. The way they lose balance or the guy who bounces off due to lack of proper alignment of the blade.
Damnthatsinteresting,fdq2d4s,t1_fdptoeh,1578651457.0,And that was why the spear was the king of the battlefield for a long time. It has reach (greater than a knife or sword) but still has the basic simplicity of stab them with the pointy end. It was also cheap and easy to use in formation.
Damnthatsinteresting,fdq29ru,t1_fdpjgfn,1578651325.0,Actually you might if you are in a duelling situation. Many sword fights aren't like the movies with a lot of back and forth but are over with as soon as the two forced engage. So you might get a situation where both fighters are just outside of cutting distance waiting for each other to make a mistake.
Damnthatsinteresting,fdq25y6,t1_fdprzo8,1578651173.0,It's skill as well. While the one called a master did a decent cut he wasn't the only one. That being said other cuts were poor given that many of them came off balance or in some cases didn't even get the proper alignment of the blade. Does the master seem to have a different type of blade? Yes. But technique certainly comes into it as well.
Damnthatsinteresting,fdq216i,t1_fdoyyu7,1578650983.0,But in a fight it can get you in trouble if your weapon is lodged inside your enemy and you have others to deal with.
Damnthatsinteresting,fdq1frp,t1_fdnzxb9,1578650124.0,I don't think it's really a rapier and swords were hardly used on the battlefield in Japan anyway. 90% of casualties are from spears and bows.
Damnthatsinteresting,fdq1bk5,t1_fdnh3bz,1578649955.0,It could also fuck you up if you have other people to be killing. You don't have to cut all the way through but you want a clean cut where it's easy to remove your blade. Having your blade stuck in someone in the middle of a fight is bad. There's a story from one Ryu in Japan where one of their members was fatally stabbed by an enemy spearman so the swords man just pushed his body down the shaft of the spear and killed the guy before dying himself. That story isn't directly related to my point but it's a cool story.

I didn't read legally required. I added that to add some objectivity. You stated a minimum requirement. Not all parents require it and so it's clearly not a universal minimum requirement. I never said doing housework was a bad thing but there are other ways for children to contribute to their social circle and I'd certainly argue that there are better uses for a child's time.

You bring up disingenuous and self reflection again and I'm starting to think you don't know what they mean. And I already covered your point outside of legality anyway. What you said was objectively wrong. I used the law to support what I was saying, and supporting what you're saying is actually a good thing. You might think about trying it at some point.

No, being able to make good inferences shows you have some thinking skills. Claiming that someone has used an ""I lose button"" in a debate is a logical fallacy. 

If you think something is wrong you calmly explain why you think it's wrong, saying ""dumbarse shit"" literally adds nothing and leads me to think you have nothing. But again, we know it's you who is being disingenuous and that you were insulting me.

Finally, just because I brought up legality when you didn't it doesn't mean that it was invalid of me to do so. I suggest you stop projecting, and follow your own suggestion of reflecting on things (possibly with professional help) and then start actually supporting your shit."

dndmemes,fdmpmif,t1_fdmnr8z,1578559581.0,"The motivation of your evil isn't really what makes it neutral evil. Although evil for evil's sake is pretty NE. What stops you being chaotic evil is if you use the law where it suits you. It this scenario playing by the rules benefits you so you follow them (if you're on the chaotic side). On the lawful side you have rules that you ""follow"" but you'll ignore them if it benefits you to do so.

""Murder? Sure, no kids unless I feel like it"". Is also pretty CE although it's more likely to be ""Murder? Sure, but I don't feel like killing kids at the moment."
dndmemes,fdmosau,t1_fdmmzxl,1578558457.0,"No. I think lawful chaotic is still lawful but uses law to create chaos (maybe more like some kind of neutral). chaotic good cares about freedom and at times might use the law for freedom but generally doesn't care about the word of the law and just wants to make things better for people.

&#x200B;

Lawful evil might use evil means to achieve a good end, or at least one they see as good, but generally it's using law to their advantage a rule through tyranny which they might see as a good thing. Dr Doom ruling the world being the only future in which humanity survives."
dndmemes,fdmokgp,t1_fdmhikr,1578558172.0,"A professional assassin can indeed be neutral. As long as they are paid and contracted they don't care. They're not randomly killing people for no reason but they also don't really care who they kill. Of course if they have a lot of rules, or codes of conduct, when it comes to killing people then they could even be lawful."
dndmemes,fdmoh7n,t1_fdmidlk,1578558057.0,"To be honest, as long as being a dick is a consistent exception to his code of not killing kids he could still be lawful evil anyway. Neutral evil wouldn't need to bind themselves with rules such as ""I don't do kids"" although they might tell someone that's the case if it benefits them somehow."

dndnext,fdmo3cv,t1_fdlf79s,1578557568.0,Then everyone should have an issue with murder and violence and yet somehow they seem not to. What a strange thing that people are unable to distinguish between fiction in one case but not in another.
dndnext,fdmo1uo,t1_fdlfmhu,1578557515.0,And yet you don't deny it so I think I'm right. And now you portray me as the bad guy in order to avoid the point. 3/10.

TLDR: learn how to use fallacies properly. 

P. S. 
So I would worry about my weak argument but according to you your point is also completely meaningless. Good game, kind sir. You fucking played yourself.

Now go and take your smug ass for a long walk off a short pier."

dndnext,fdl9gz1,t1_fdl8g9h,1578519316.0,I don't think the show is perfect by any means. I'd watch a season 2 but I have no interest in rewatching season 1. I think you have a personal issue with sexual assault and you're making it an issue with the show. But the issue is YOUR issue and not the show's issue.

AmItheAsshole,fdkzuwv,t1_fdkz50b,1578514545.0,"Not really victim blaming. I didn't say it was her fault she got cheated on (if she's even being cheated on because is it even confirmed she is a victim?) but that it's hard to claim she has good instincts if we only know two things about her. 1) She married a guy (that presumably she thought was marriage material). 2) She suspects he is cheating. So whatever way it goes in reality that would show that her feelings on things are 50/50 which I would not call ""good"".

But good reading comprehension, I'm glad I have to treat every post like a ELI5."
