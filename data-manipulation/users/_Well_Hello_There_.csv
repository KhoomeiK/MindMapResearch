introvert,fdh8fdg,t3_el1h7a,1578417643.0,"I'm an extrovert and I too sometimes feel that way. I don't get a lot of hugs. But, I have a friend and he is an introvert, and he doesn't like hugs because he's scared he'll mess it up or make it awkward, but I think he needs a tight warm hug. And, I really hope you get a nice hug soon, but here's one from me \*Hugs\*."
