toptalent,ffjiod0,t1_ffjgru6,1579999087.0,"I'm in Wisconsin. I get why people are upset about the prices and I support the push for fairer market/tax regulation, but holy shit does it make me angry when it's still a life ruining event to get caught here, and those with the luxury of legality elsewhere are just complaining about how legalization didn't magically produce a perfect system overnight."

scifi,ffhd24o,t3_etl2ac,1579930420.0,"I love the movie, but I'm lukewarm on the book. Only read the first one. The writing is beautiful, but the plot and the meaning it purportedly serves are pretty weak. The movie does a much better job tying all the elements into a cohesive, meaningful narrative.

The movie is, I feel, often unfairly critiqued as though it were in the horror genre, when it's actually hard scifi. It's a study on the concept of identity. Alien intelligence encounters an environment so foreign to it that it doesn't even understand the concept of biological differentiation. In order to learn, it starts experimenting with how the environment is put together, remixing and combining elements from different organisms and systems. By the end, Lena understands what it is and what it's doing. During their confrontation, it attempts to understand her through mimicry, and she uses that to destroy it. She's still infected afterwards, but she seems to accept it and I like to think that she's willingly playing host, volunteering herself to act as teacher and guide to the alien life."

PublicFreakout,fcz1qmt,t1_fcz05ns,1578091912.0,"I make no assumption, but rather the assertion that no human is individually capable of fairly generating the kind of value that buys a Lamborghini. The common wisdom that entrepreneurs shoulder more risk than employees and are therefore entitled to more reward holds true up until a certain point, but no further. I'm no communist and think the value of properly regulated markets is crucial to human progress, but to say that one man can ever through hard work create the value necessary to produce a lamborghini is to indulge in capitalist visions of Utopia."
PublicFreakout,fcyz9q7,t1_fcyxr8d,1578090386.0,"Leaving this joyriding incident aside for a moment, let's just take a step back here and recognize that nobody works hard enough to own a Lamborghini. The very existence of luxury items like that are a testament to the usurous income inequality that pervades the modern economy. That man did not earn that Ferrari, the employees that made his wealth possible earned it, and were subsequently not fairly compensated for the value they generated."
