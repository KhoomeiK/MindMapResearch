AskReddit,fe45hds,t1_fe3n8uv,1578855997.0,"Same for pets, especially dogs. I would say to budget an extra several hundred-thousand on said pet. Especially if the pet is very young, special needs, or very old.

Regardless of whether you go to the shelter or breeder, any pet needs food, water, and accessories. Pets can also be destructive, so repair costs are necessary (RIP carpet and drywall). Potty training is another cost, same for dog training. There’s also pet rent and vet visits. For dogs and cats, you are looking at boarding, doggie day care, and so on."

AskParents,fds1khc,t1_fdrpl7b,1578692956.0,"Thank you as well. My parents follow the ‘call their parents once a day’ mentality as they are immigrants and they left their families to make a better life/send money to them.

I think mentality is better."
AskParents,fds1c7z,t1_fdrg3ab,1578692814.0,"Thank you. I am looking into that, plus I’ll take over insurance soon. I’ll take the email advice! I can’t legally keep my sister permanently as my apartment has rules.  I will also work on saying ‘no’ without giving reasons."
personalfinance,fdr675u,t3_emqyx6,1578680060.0,"For me, the puppy stage was expensive. After that, other than food, we’re good. Apartment supplies poop bags, I get home to walk her, we have a huge walking trail, and so on."
AskParents,fdr09pz,t1_fdqvm4i,1578677810.0,"No, I pay my own rent. He WANTS to pay my rent and have my sister move in with me. I chose a one bedroom as my complex was afforadable and I handle it. If I need anything and my parents happen to buy it (for example, I needed a jacket and I didn’t have time to go, so my mom got me one), I will repay them by money transfer.

I do pay them back. Only car insurance is under his name as rates are cheaper due to my age. I am worried about the car insurance. I’m not as worried about the phone service as it’s under me, but they do know my social and whatnot, so I’m worried that they can possibly get into my account. Specifically my dad, not mom. She usually gives me my space about 90% of the time.

I am financially independent in other ways. I think my main issue is fear. You can already see how much helicopter parenting I had and well, it does instill a sense of fear there that everything can fall apart. Which is why I’m attempting to set boundaries."
AskParents,fdqte5f,t1_fdqqe8k,1578674475.0,Thank you. I will definitely try that.
AskParents,fdqtcvv,t1_fdqqak9,1578674454.0,"Okay and thank you. I never heard of JADE, but I can see why that is not a good idea in this situation. Thanks for the advice:"
AskParents,fdqt93y,t1_fdqp5k0,1578674390.0,"Yeah, that’s a bit difficult right now. I do plan on that once my lease ends, if I break the lease, I will be liable for the unpaid rent left on my lease term (I couldn’t find an apartment that didn’t do this in the area, sadly). While I am careful with finances, that will be too much on me as I have 6.5 months left on the lease.

My neighbors watch out for me and tell him I’m not home. He also doesn’t have my keys, my neighbors do. I told them not to let anyone in if I’m at work/out."
AskParents,fdqswx4,t1_fdqovw0,1578674184.0,"So yes, I do have financial independence. To clarify, for the car insurance, I do pay it off, but their rates are better than mine due to my age. Everything else is under my name and I pay them back if they bought something (like I’ve been far too busy at my job+ CPA exam to buy a new coat, so my mom bought me one and I repaid her), mainly because I don’t like things being held over my head.

I am independent, it’s just that they still try to treat me like a child. And yes, there have been times I lost my temper enough. I did say ‘no’, to quite a few things-

1. Checking phone history and putting text/call blocks after a certain time
2. Paying my rent
3. Paying my utilities/maintaining my bank account
4. Insurance (exclude car, I repay them)
And so on.

I am independent and if I have an energency, I do repay them. I am good about my finances as well. It’s just I get sick of being treated as a kid when I visit and have walked out a few times due to that."

AskParents,fdqoo7d,t1_fdqg8pf,1578671560.0,"Thank you and I will definitely try that. Yes, they do have helicopter parent tendencies, especially him. I had him blocked for a long time, but then my sister started mentioning that he was going to start visiting and force himself into my apartment to stay, put in cameras, etc. because he’s worried about me, and I was like ‘fml’.


I’m all for visiting for dinner, but not like that. Yeah, no.

I still do love my parents. They did do a lot for me and were definitely supportive during my mental health issues in high school. They took me to every appointment and so on. They are willing to drop everything for me if I need help. So they do a lot for me, but I also need them to realize that I am not a kid."
AskParents,fdqo9mw,t1_fdqhwhf,1578671307.0,"I did say no. And listed reasons why. It’s still an argument.

They’re going with the ‘we track your siblings’ phones and it’s only fair we track yours too’. I pointed out that my siblings live with them and they pay for said phones."
AskParents,fdqo53w,t1_fdqmry9,1578671228.0,"Thank you. I meant to clarify- I do pay them back on the car insurance, but they pay it initially, then I transfer the money. I am independent on that aspect. I did mention that and we are still going back and forth with this. I’ve tried to be respectful and point out that it is unethical, plus I am independent, but they keep trying to treat me like a child and make decisions for me."
AmItheAsshole,fdp1nr4,t1_fdn80o2,1578617872.0,"It depends on what OP has. If she has work files, that’s an issue.

Like I’m a tax auditor. But I used to do taxes for a small business (my own) and may have to carry forms around. Some information was on my computer, others were paper documents that my client gives to me.  Some clients like to have paper copies. These documents have social security numbers, sometimes bank account information, taxpayer IDs, and so on. They were all in my backpack with my laptop, if I have to run into the store, I take it with me.

If I had gotten held at a store and they wanted to check my backpack, I would say no. Mainly because I have that sensitive information and it can get mishandled, lost, or the store can see it. Also, I can get in trouble (sued/even go to prison) if anything happens to that information, given the sensitive information on the documents.

So I would definitely say ‘no’ to a search like that."

I do hope so. Mochi is good with my brother’s cat in that she adores him, but he hates her. Not sure if she will like a kitten, maybe she will. My old cat, Eclair, and my brother’s cat, Almond, were close. She took him in, licked him, taught him to hunt, and so on."

Just an fyi, if you’re a smaller business, you might want to have your contractors sign a non-compete form.

Goals:

Get a second cat.

Max out 401K/Roth IRA. For 401K, my work automatically puts in 9.5% of annual salary and an extra 1% into a Roth IRA.

Open a HSA (maybe) later on, not sure, need more research here.

Look into getting a small house/townhome that can become investment property later on. I already have 10K in savings for this and can save up about 1.5K (or more, have to build budget)/monthly after March. I also want to live in said property for a couple of years, then rent it out.
