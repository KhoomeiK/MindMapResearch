I went upstairs to grab my cat from outside and let her up into my room when I was confronted by an extremely bright light just chilling in the sky.

I went inside to call my parents and tell them what I saw, and after the conversation ended, I walked back outside to take a video. The light had slowly begun to ascend at that point and by the time I got back outside it was gone.

My mom told me it was most likely a drone or a toy helicopter, but it was dead silent. I only heard crickets. I would’ve heard it if it were a drone. To top it off, Maggie seemed pretty skittish when I let her inside.
