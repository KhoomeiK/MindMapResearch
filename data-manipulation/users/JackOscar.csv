That only works for the normal distribution. This is a binominal distribution so there's no such thing as P(8.92 zergs). P(8 zergs or less) = 0.99617415406 so you would *technically* still need 9 zegs to reach above 0.997 which is 3 sigma for the normal distribution, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find a natural scientist who would accept 8 Zergs as just a statistical abnormality."
