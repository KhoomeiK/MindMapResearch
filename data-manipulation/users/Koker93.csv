After the hot bath, ice bath the steak for 10 minutes or so.  Just leave it in the bag and dunk it in ice water.  You cool the steak a lot in a short time that way - much more so than a trip in the fridge uncovered.  Then you can sear in a hot pan instead of a screaming hot pan and get that crusty sear everyone loves without overcooking the center of the steak.

Gas probably averaged $2.50/gallon.

So 746355/15*2.5= $124,395.50  Seems really high - I might suck at math.

Also - gas pumps at about 13 gal/minute.  thats 57,412 minutes - or 40 full days of pumping gas into this truck over the last 13 years."

I've had an Anova for 2+ years (black friday 2017.)  It died about 2 months before the warranty ran out.  But considering I'd cooked dinner with it 3-6 days a week for 2 years I wasn't upset - and then Anova replaced it under warranty.  Its been almost 6 months since they replaced it and it's got at least 300 hours on it - still chugging along."

Also - basically all the apps give a minimum amount of time, so if you go by the charts your cook times may get longer.  This steak looks about an inch thick?  At 131 that's 2 hrs and 45 minutes."
AskReddit,ffjjzmj,t3_ett7fr,1579999956.0,When I was 19 I set my parents garage on fire with the grill trying to make steak for lunch.  I put the fire out long before the fire department got there and after seeing the damage in the garage and hearing how I put it out the fire chief told me I should apply to be a volunteer firefighter.  I will forever regret not taking him up on it. I will always be mad at 19yr old me and the fact I'm chicken around real blood.
sousvide,ffjjdn8,t3_etwh12,1579999551.0,"If you're not happy with your sear (sounds like you'd prefer it was darker) there is a great method to do better, and it's not ""get that pan so hot you burn off the seasoning and then throw in the steak.""

Right after the hot bath, give the steak an ice water bath and get it right back down to fridge temp.  Now you have 2 choices.

1) throw the steak in the fridge and sear it anytime from now to 2 weeks from now.  If you follow a pasteurization chart a steak will keep in teh fridge for a good long time.

2) sear it right away.  If you choose number two, cut it out of the bag and dry it off.  Searing it will heat the steak back up enough that it will taste hot.  Mine get back up to 120 pretty easily.  But what you gain is the ability to use med-high heat ( a little hotter than cooking bacon) so you can get a great crust with less smoke and without overcooking the middle.

Give it a shot - you'll like the results if what you're after is a dark crusty sear."

And if the retractable cover rips its totally ridiculous what a pool company charges to replace it.  And the concrete deck around the pool was cracking, so he had to replace that.

It's not that a pool by itself is expensive, it's that if (when?) it breaks it costs a lot of money to fix.  Hopefully yours continues to only cost a few hundred a year..."
