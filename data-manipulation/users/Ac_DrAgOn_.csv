AskEngineers,ffkijin,t3_eu3cxp,1580023336.0,"*Technically* speaking there is a difference between ANSI and ISO tolerance standards when it comes to manufacturing chains and sprockets. That said, you may have lucked out in your case because 12.7 mm and 0.5 in are probably the closest approximation between the two systems so you’ll probably be fine. 

It’ll be slightly less energy efficient and increase the amount of wear on the components over time, but if it’s just a pet project it’ll probably work, at least for testing. 

Honestly though, of you’re ordering a sprocket anyway, you might as well get a length of chain from the same manufacturer to match just to have your bases covered."

AskReddit,feuvye7,t3_eqo6wd,1579390443.0,"Congress has already impeached him and that was the right move. His conduct is unacceptable if not unconstitutional and covering up his personal interactions with foreign governments is far from the first time he’s abused his power. 

The debate is whether or not he should be removed from office. He’s almost definitely not going to be convicted in a senate trial because he has enough influence to destroy the career of any GOP member that opposes him. That doesn’t mean that it’s not important, however. The American people need to see everything.

Personally I don’t think he should be removed. His ability to fuel irrational fears and instill a sense of victimhood in people is his only political strategy. He would surely try to cause unrest and insist that his followers take it personally if he were removed.

He’s going to do that anyway, but he’ll have less of a case if and when he’s voted out legitimately in a few months despite his attempts to once again misinform people"

You can use one on the bolt side as well if the surface is particularly rough or uneven, and that’ll help. Washers are not to be used as spacers though. If you have extra room, then you have the wrong bolt for the job."
