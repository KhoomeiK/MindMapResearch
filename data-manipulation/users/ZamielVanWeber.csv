menwritingwomen,ffft8y6,t1_fff2bxw,1579891299.0,This passage is so awful I instinctively protected my penis.
AmItheAsshole,fffrz3i,t1_fffpwyv,1579890510.0,Giving ultimatums to your parents concerning your siblings is eyebrow raising at minimum. This post reads like you hate your brother and are digging for reasons to be spiteful rather than you two merely being radically different people.
AmItheAsshole,fffjpys,t1_fffjedl,1579885438.0,Jealousy is negative. A jealous person will go to terrible lengths to protect/possess the object of their jealousy.
AmItheAsshole,fffiz7c,t1_fff2477,1579884980.0,Jealousy is when you fear to lose something you have. Envy is when you want to possess something someone else has. The definitions are starting to merge which can be annoying as fuck at times.
AmItheAsshole,ffe5zyf,t1_ffcv06x,1579837608.0,"The right to know is based on a right to your medical history. Right now there is a huge gap in OP's medical record and any hope of finding it is closing (or has already closed, to be fair). If I had to guess that information is long gone and OP has no choice but to let sleeping dogs lie, but waiting will only make that more likely. I would advise that cut a deal with their mother: pay for a genetic screening at a medical facility to develop a more complete medical history and OP buries this story for good."
AmItheAsshole,ffe535j,t1_ffdzyth,1579836917.0,"Making a salad a meal without animal products is difficult but man, did OP not even try.
Edit: this has brought an army of excellent salad suggestions."
AmItheAsshole,ffa1ffq,t1_ffa199f,1579725953.0,"The teachers might and that would be a nightmare, but that is a corner case. OP is definitely the asshole for not waiting and handling the situation with grace, or just explaining that some words are a bit different between the two countries but not to worry about it."
AmItheAsshole,ffa13za,t1_ff9mlnf,1579725768.0,Rubber specifically is going to be an issue as a few words have radically different meanings in American vs British English (eg rubber: condom vs eraser). Most of the time it will be weird minor stuff though that will likely be ironed out in school.
TokyoAfterschool,ff4ywoh,t3_erdxcg,1579575792.0,I just got Valentine Aizen trying to get Surtr. I just want Surtr as my husbando...
StoriesAboutKevin,fesko53,t1_fesfz8q,1579366214.0,"Yes. LSD is a liquid. Plenty of other nastiness in pill form though. Kevin could have gotten himself killed... or worse*





*expelled

Edit: LSD is a crystal at STP, not a liquid like I remembered. I stand corrected."
AmItheAsshole,fescwr0,t1_fes8xag,1579363956.0,That would make the host TA for giving catastrophically bad advice to their guest. You have a right to the property you pay for and are not an asshole just for defending it when it is stolen.
pettyrevenge,feolhbt,t1_feh06uz,1579301842.0,"Listen, making your children eat PB&J that they assembled with their own hands is essentially one step from boiling them. /s"
MaliciousCompliance,feoaqrj,t1_fek709u,1579297455.0,How is everyone missing that this is a Monty Python reference? Meaning of Life baby!
MaliciousCompliance,feo9a34,t1_femqewy,1579296811.0,"I was once told to find ""plain sauce."" Manager found out and handed me an empty container to bring back. They never tried anything like that on me again."
AmItheAsshole,fek9bgw,t1_fejvoet,1579195297.0,"As a note the alcohol in the wine does *not* evaporate in a relevant degree. That is a myth. I won't condone or condemn their behavior, but remember this tidbit."
schizophrenia,fe67g4p,t3_envio4,1578883489.0,There are two brief psychotic disorders. Also schizophrenia can go into temporary remission.
Gloryhammer,fe2saoz,t1_fe2rrzr,1578842357.0,"Regis is ""of the king"" and ""kobalos"" is a Greek spirit that came into English meaning ""goblin."" Properly translated it means ""king of the goblin"" not ""goblins"" but I assume the bad Greek was intentional."
Gloryhammer,fe2pd8e,t3_eno81f,1578841430.0,"It is a mix of Greek and Latin that roughly translates to ""king of the goblins"" or ""goblin king."""
TwoSentenceHorror,fdxfif7,t3_en8ip9,1578768215.0,I have a carpeted kitchen. It sucks but is not as bad as it seems. I do need to rent a rug doctor again...
schizoaffective,fdx9hpl,t1_fdx97os,1578766624.0,"Be aware that if you do not possess a high ""insight"" you may never realize how badly you need meds even when actively suffering due to being off them."
bipolar,fdx7r95,t1_fdx73ev,1578766134.0,Fairly. My psych had to convince my insurance to cover it but the change in quality of life and efficacy over Geodon was very pronounced for me. People were commenting on it pronounced. IIRC it is ~1700$ a month. If I did not have fantastic insurance it would be untennable.
bipolar,fdx6is3,t1_fdwd3k4,1578765816.0,"Antipsychotics cause weight gain by stimulating appetite. So avoiding weight gain on them is a matter of monitoring your hunger queues by being initially suspicious of them, not trusting. 

I ended up gaining and losing a ton of weight on geodon. Vraylar has been much milder on that front but I still get bizarre ""you are hungry"" queues that make no sense."
schizoaffective,fdwj5bn,t1_fdwesm6,1578759210.0,The weight gain is from appetite stimulation. You will need to monitor your eating carefully or try a drug like wellbutrin or topomax (they both suppress appetite).
furry_irl,fdwdrb5,t1_fdvfp2n,1578757645.0,They engage in frottage.
furry_irl,fdsennk,t1_fds8lhj,1578700967.0,"I am learning to be louder. My husband used to think I hated bottoming because I was not too noisy. No sweetie, I just enjoy relaxing with a fat dick up my ass."
tarot,fdqt023,t3_emsw7g,1578674236.0,The Voyager Tarot is my favorite.
FellowKids,fdpsg7z,t3_emm6dv,1578638710.0,I have used conlang (it is a word writers tend to use) and amazeballs. Most of these are foreign to me.
bipolar,fdode3k,t1_fdnpanh,1578603093.0,"Funny, because lamictal was absolutely non effective for me. Then again I have schizoaffective so they could be the culprit."
DarkSouls2,fdk6ohl,t1_fdk4d5q,1578497305.0,The infusion blacksmith is hidden in Lost Bastille and getting him to infuse weapons requires you to beat the Pursuer in FoFG.
MaliciousCompliance,fditybw,t1_fdi45z1,1578450974.0,I need to try those before they are gone.
tarot,fdfouvn,t3_el4fmh,1578366676.0,What deck is that exactly? That is so cool. My largest cards are nothing close to that size.
menwritingwomen,fde1dk6,t1_fdd19z4,1578328978.0,"While there is much to unpack, let's just throw out the suitcase, shall we?"
bipolar,fd5c9xa,t1_fd3q691,1578176182.0,"Wellbutrin causes weight loss. Both work on appetite, with abilify stimulating it and wellbutrin suppressing it."
schizophrenia,fd51l9t,t3_ejz2e2,1578173324.0,Yes. My cousin builds up a rapid resistance to any anti-psychotic he is put on. It is what ended up keeping him institutionalized.
schizophrenia,fd511zc,t3_ek1w06,1578173137.0,Once. I hear voices rarely and one did try to get into an argument with me.
AmItheAsshole,fczhldr,t1_fczh7ws,1578101424.0,"IIRC aquagenic urticaria can affect the throat, but not beyond that. Also the condition is profound and very rare so it is unlikely to be what we are seeing."
Youniqueamua,fcysbdw,t1_fcynrro,1578086017.0,"At that price you can donate 15$ to a Woman's Shelter and come out ahead financially, to say nothing of the scam. Then again, huns generally aren't amazing at math."
schizophrenia,fcwjx6n,t1_fcwab2e,1578027649.0,They are also born that way.

AmItheAsshole,fcllh2e,t1_fcjj0uy,1577750563.0,Two weeks is a courtesy primarily for your boss. If your boss is shit then they don't get courtesy.
AmItheAsshole,fclk0qe,t1_fclh9j6,1577749589.0,How did you get into Cambridge without recognizing an idiom...
AmItheAsshole,fcfr1i8,t1_fcbzpus,1577632881.0,"From experience they definitely have a problem with it, but it is just rarely worth the money to get angry about it. Legally it is stealing as the food is not yours until you have paid for it and they reserve the right to refuse service (making it impossible to pay for and thus making you a bonafide thief). It all worked out in the end this time, but what I recommend is grab the item to be eaten, rush and pay for it, then snack, making sure you keep the receipt on you. 

Also this time was definitely an all's well that ends well situation. NTA"
AmItheAsshole,fc8v5h4,t1_fc5kykq,1577542513.0,My father has a spare pair of Sennheiser that he handed to me and the quality on those is just perfect (plus their excellent noise cancelling). I always recommend those if they are in budget.
AmItheAsshole,fc3ipta,t1_fc2285u,1577390679.0,There is a Swabian dish (maultaschen) that supposedly gets its name from God's inability to see through pasta. Cheating a supposedly omniscient being is a surprisingly common theme.
Youniqueamua,fc38wge,t1_fc386ic,1577384295.0,30% off sale. That is the only non insane part of this ad.
delusionalcraigslist,fbrnsei,t1_fbrnk2w,1577044600.0,I know. The computers my father worked on are in a museum now. However there is no value to a machine like the listed one nowadays.
