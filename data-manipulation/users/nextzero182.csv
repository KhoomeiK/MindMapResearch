horror,ffeaoms,t1_ffe9964,1579841433.0,"I wasn't speaking in regards to this movie, just responding to that statement. But yes, even a simple shot like that could be a logistics issue. Films like that with huge stars tend to run on a strict shooting schedule with little opportunity for re-shoots; if things don't look exactly perfect, they have the budget to just fix it in post. It may have been a while since you've seen it but the first film has the same type of CGI-work so I really don't know what you expected from a sequel. 

I wouldn't let your bad impression of one major Hollywood horror/comedy dictate ""how far horror has fallen"". There are plenty of filmmakers out there still making fantastic horror movies with awesome practical effects."
horror,ffe8san,t3_et463c,1579839823.0,"> I get it, cgi is cheaper than practical effects

This isn't always true, really a case-by-case basis and the cost usually isn't the reason why filmmakers use CGI. It has more to do with the logistics of pulling off whatever effect they intend to."

sousvide,feuwbh1,t1_feuvv5z,1579390568.0,Yeah it's just a duck leg with duck fat but honestly you can just do a duck leg with no additional fat. The leg should have plenty of fat to coat itself once it starts to render.
sousvide,feun242,t1_feumypl,1579388090.0,I'll have to try that!

Just because an artist isn't popular on here doesn't make them ""slept on"", sometimes people just don't like it. For instance, I hate moneybagg and I wouldn't ever click on a thread about him. It's not because I'm ""sleeping on him"", it's because I don't like him."
