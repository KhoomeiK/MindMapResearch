islam,fd51een,t1_fd4gk1w,1578173257.0,"I agree with this, too.

I went through the same soul searching you did.  Exploring different religions, landed on Islam, heard Surah Fatiha recited, and I knew it was the one. I converted when I was a senior in high school. I lived with my parents. I spent that time learning.  I also lived at home two years after high school. Didn’t tell my parents until 4 years after my conversion bc my dad told me, prior to converting, that becoming Muslim would be an insult to the family. 

Sometimes I would leave the house to pray in my car. If I couldn’t leave or pray in the house, I would wait until everyone is asleep. 

As for fasting, I fasted when I could. I’m Filipino, so when you refuse to eat with the family, it is a huge insult. So sometimes I wouldn’t be home all day and fast (when the days were shorter).  Other times, I would break my fast and make it up another time. 

I think the most important advice I wish I received was: “Don’t be so hard on yourself.”  Allah knows the intention in your heart. Be patient with yourself. As much as we want to do everything all at once, Islam is about ease.  

Please feel free to reach out. I truly mean it.  Converting to Islam was one of the best decisions I have ever made. But it was definitely difficult, lonely, and challenging along the way.  It gets easier with time, InshAllah.  Don’t let the hardship and the teachings of Islam close your mind, instead, I pray it only continues to open and soften your heart. 

May Allah bring you ease and surround you with kind, righteous people. Ameen."

AskWomen,fch1wfb,t3_eh8tuc,1577646477.0,"Look at yourself in the mirror (without makeup) and tell yourself aloud, “You are beautiful, inside and out.  My imperfections make me beautiful.” [Then compliment yourself, ie, “I have beautiful eyes and I’m so thankful I have the opportunity to see this gorgeous day,” or, “I have a beautiful smile and I enjoy sharing it with others.”]

Repeat multiple times, and do it daily.  It feels weird at first, but it’s getting over the ego and moving into the subconscious and living a more grateful life."
