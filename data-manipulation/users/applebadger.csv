I like being with my friends and other people, but I’d definitely prefer hanging out with one person instead of a group. I get way too exhausted if I’m with too many people. 

Also I’m picky, so a lot of people annoy me >.>"

I don’t have a lot against her, but I dislike how much credit she gets. For example, she won album of the year at the Grammys, but the only song I heard from that was Bad Guy, which blew up. Whereas Ariana Grande’s album as a whole was much more listened to."
