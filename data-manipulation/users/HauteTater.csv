AskReddit,ffv14g8,t3_ebud5r,1580253280.0,"Never thought that Kobe would be added to this list, but his loss impacted me in a way I hadn’t imagined. Although many people are upset because of past allegations against him, I’m not one to judge him, or the people who are judging him. All I know is that since my junior year of high school, when I was a Seattle SuperSonics fan (still am, though I claim Clippers now) I started hearing about this 17yo phenom in LA. At such a young age his talent was undeniable, as well as his work ethic. 

The relationship that Kobe had with the community of LA was undeniable. He was the golden son, having such a successful career on and off the court. When he retired four years ago I didn’t get swept up in the fanfare, but admired the long goodbye being surrounded by “Thank you, Kobe” all over the LA basin. 

Never did I think that so soon after his retirement the communities of LA, and the sports world, would have to say goodbye permanently. Being the same age as him I feel impacted similarly as to when Aaliyah perished in a plane crash 20+ years ago (another avoidable tragedy). 

My heart goes out to my adopted community of SoCal (Laker fans in particular), sports fans, his family, and of course the loved ones of the others lost. Please remember to be kind to others, love as much as you can, and live your life to the fullest."
