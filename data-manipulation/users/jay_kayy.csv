I would like to say that I appreciate a lot of these suggestions and although it would be difficult in a hard moment, I’m passing this to my husband in the hopes that it’ll help him. We have a great relationship but I want him to always feel like he can tell me what he needs too, or to tell me when enough is enough for him. Sometimes it’s hard not to feel like a burden on those you love."
bipolar,fewcrhi,t3_eqmjik,1579408482.0,Nice! I toyed with getting this but got the one I posted earlier.
bipolar,fewc8la,t1_fevrsrg,1579408258.0,"I suppose it’s a matter of perspective? I think having the same tattoo as my bipolar peers is empowering and looking at it reminds me that there are so many others like me that struggle daily and I know we can get through it no matter the highs, no matter the lows and it’s a bitch. But that’s my take on it.  Have a great day!"

bipolar,feuc13a,t1_feu8blc,1579385140.0,Well it’s a bipolar tattoo so I would hope so :)
todayilearned,fbmo1zl,t3_edml8u,1576986626.0,It also shares traits with schizoaffective disorder. There are many different disorders that overlap and as someone with bipolar 1 I’d say it varies per person. Some people have shared traits with other mood/personality disorders but without my medication I would be severely depressed or extremely manic majority of the times. I’m not sure that borderline is similar in that respect.
