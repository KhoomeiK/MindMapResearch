Seek psychiatric help. 

Paranoid delusions really are a symptom of schizophrenia, which in rare cases manifests in outbursts of violence and self-harm. More frequently, those who do not get treatment experience a steady decline in mental health and basic societal function causing the sufferer to withdraw from personal and professional relationships, resulting in what's known as a ""downward spiral"" of antisocial behavior. If a psychiatrist diagnoses you with schizophrenia or a similar mental illness, you can be prescribed medication, and with therapy, you can live a normal life."

>The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader, and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.

>Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
Mind-altering practices (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, or debilitating work routines) are used in excess and serve to suppress doubts about the group and its leader(s).

>The leadership dictates, sometimes in great detail, how members should think, act, and feel (e.g., members must get permission to date, change jobs, or marry—or leaders prescribe what to wear, where to live, whether to have children, how to discipline children, and so forth).

>The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s), and its members (e.g., the leader is considered the Messiah, a special being, an avatar—or the group and/or the leader is on a special mission to save humanity).

>The group has a polarized, us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.

>The leader is not accountable to any authorities (unlike, for example, teachers, military commanders, or ministers, priests, monks, and rabbis of mainstream religious denominations).

>The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary. This may result in members participating in behaviors or activities they would have considered reprehensible or unethical before joining the group (e.g., lying to family or friends, or collecting money for bogus charities).

>The leadership induces feelings of shame and/or guilt in order to influence and control members. Often this is done through peer pressure and subtle forms of persuasion.

>The group is preoccupied with making money.


>Members are encouraged or required to live and/or socialize only with other group members.

>The most loyal members (the “true believers”) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group. They believe there is no other way to be, and often fear reprisals to themselves or others if they leave—or even consider leaving—the group.

I don't owe him, or you, civility. He lost that consideration after I watched the twentieth school shooting followed by zero action, thanks to the gun nuts refusing to compromise on anything.
