Pump moves the water through the filter through pipes and stuff then back into the pond via waterfall. The very first time I tried to clean everything out, I disconnected the pump and sat there thinking any minute it would stop flowing and I'd be good to go. Yeah after like 30 minutes when it was still going I realized that I was an idiot and I would have to remove the pipes from the water too otherwise the vacuum would just keep it flowing in a circle lol. Oops."

You got someone a pet that they didn't agree to as a gift with an improper setup. Beta are not supposed to be kept in a small cup of stagnant water and neither are those frogs. Doing this in the first place was wrong, as is your attitude towards pet ownership. You should not have animals. 
Good on him for (it sounds like) actually doing research and trying to give them a suitable home. He also potentially found a new enjoyable hobby for himself.

That said, he doesn't have a right to charge you for it. I understand where he is coming from because most likely in his mind, he's getting the basic supplies required to take care of these animals that he didn't chose to keep. Then again, he's also going a little beyond that, and two wrongs don't make a right."

Why don't you report them now before an incident actually occurs? If this continues (which I have no doubt it will) and your dog does bite the other one, you think you will get reported and that could cause trouble for you. Right now this person is the one causing issues and you can take preventative action by complaining to your complex. If your dogs did fight you could get injured, or even keeping your own dog from acting here could have led to you getting hurt. Address it while it is clear you aren't the negligent owner."

Anorexia nervosa has nothing to do with bmi. (want to specify I'm also not talking about the symptom of ""anorexia"" where you just don't want to eat, but this also has nothing to do with bmi). It is a mental/emotional disorder. You do not get disgnosed with a very specific mental disease because you lost weight. Weight loss can be due to a million things, healthy or terrible. That doesn't mean everyone with a low bmi is anorexic. Do you not understand how ridiculous that sounds?"

science,fc256oq,t1_fby1c0q,1577340910.0,"Well I am physically unable to take so many fillers, and my mom is worse. The compounded medications do just fine whether or not you say the fillers are ""good"". And why are they so different between companies then if they're necessary? Why am I not allowed to get generic brand A when I know it works for me just because that's not what the pharmacies work with, when the ""same"" generic med of brand B is known to give me potentially deadly allergic reactions? Now company B is out of business because nobody is working with them and I'm SOL. Or even the same case but without a reaction, instead A just works better for me. The system is messed up, and the fillers are not necessary if they can be so easily substituted. I am certain that because of her disease, a medication will be the cause of my mother's death. I'm not there yet, but she's gotten worse over time so I wouldn't be surprised if I'm in the same place one day. 

But please explain to me why the tetanus vaccine, yes specifically that one, is necessary. I'm sure there are others of the same nature. Uncombined. About every single person I know has had an incident of going to the hospital and needing a tetanus shot from exposure from a wound, all of them were up to date on the vaccine. How is that now or later? It's both. Let's sell double of the vaccine and make double money. Or on the flip side, if the vaccine is so ineffective that it does not protect me more than a month after getting it, I still don't see the use. The incidence of disease is ridiculously rare, the shot does not protect anyone else around me, and I am guaranteed to have to get one when something happens. My chances of dying from a vaccine are 100s of times more likely than ever getting tetanus, that is for sure. 

I know you're trying to do good, but just blindly saying ""vaccines good"" is only slightly better than saying ""vaccines bad"". What's needed is information. The spread of legitimate information so everyone can be more knowledgeable. And more choices and options. Monopolies are making it so that the consumer doesn't have a choice, and it's simply wrong. Brand A isn't going out of business because people don't like it or react poorly to it, it's going out of business because the owner of brand B paid more. That is not how something this important should be allowed to work. I went to med school (dropped out) but I'm no idiot. If you think I'm just some uninformed idiot who's contributing to a problem, I assure you, every medicine/shot/etc I've ever taken or refused, I have spent well more than a full day reading about. Nothing has convinced me. When the system stops being so broken, it will be a lot easier to get people on board. It's hard to trust people who don't have your best interests in mind."

TwoXChromosomes,fby28j0,t1_fbxh08b,1577206326.0,"Okay that is not true or at least not my experience. I have serious insecurity about my labia, but that is because of my body itself, nobody ever said anything to me and I didn't even know what normal was! Still it started when I was a small child much too young to think about sex when things got ""weird"" and I never fully got over it. I considered labiaplasty but I know it isn't worth it. Men I've been with have tried to make me feel better because I always immediately tell them my concerns, but I'll never fully be able to get over it.

If you want the specifics (understandable if you don't, stop reading) my labia at one point were normal and small. I actually think they were lretty perfect with the knowledge I have now. When I was around 7-8 years old, I suddenly had an issue with severe discomfort and itching on my left side labia. Came out of nowhere, crazy horrible itching and burning. I didn't have school that day and I remember staying in the bathroom all day long because it was unbearable. By the end of the day, my left labia had swollen to 10s of times its normal size. Almost a golf ball is how I would describe it. I knew that boys had testicles and I was afraid I was growing one or something so I was way too embarrassed to say anything to someone. I didn't want to become a boy! After that the swelling very slowly went down over time, but it didn't return to normal. The edges became jagged and discolored. It still was much longer than the other side, and when the swelling went down it just looked... deflated. Extra stretched skin all there. It was like that one side went through bad puberty except literally overnight and in a terribly unpleasant way. For years I was worried about becoming a man, but that fear eventually subsided into my teens. I was still traumatized by what happened. I know that many woman are uneven and that it could have been caused by hormones, but I remember it so vividly and I hate it, and I never got a real explanation. Plus looking and seeing the other side with the constant reminder of how they both used to be sucks. It makes me feel disfigured. I know there are so many risks and I decided I shouldn't put myself through surgery for it, besides I know it will never actually look like it used to, but I have often wanted to get the one side done to even it out. I guess not everything is about what men like. They don't care at all, but I do."
