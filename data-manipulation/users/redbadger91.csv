Basically, the holes the balls moved out of the body through when the fetus developed are still there and the balls can move through or at least into them and ""disappear"". However, they can be pushed out again by pressing on the area with your hand. It can impair fertility over time, but it's not dangerous and usually not painful either."

Warhammer40k,fehupqw,t3_ep8s1l,1579124244.0,"Apparently Rowboat Girlyman (Roboute Guilliman) gave the Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Cawl the order to start experimenting with Primarch DNA and other technology shenanigans ~10k years ago and Cawl found McGuffin-ways of improving Astartes further. He bred those improved Marines for ~10k years and also gave them better armour and weapons, because why not? Nothing he can't do apparently. When Guilliman returned, all those thousands and thousands of Primaris were taken on what was basically a Great Crusade 2.0 and all the chapters were given their share of Primaris. Additionally, more chapters were founded with nothing but Primaris.

It's basically a lot of McGuffins, ridiculous plot devices, Gary Stu/ Mary Sue and reasons to sell more and updated Marines, basically making the 10k+ years of Astartes history obsolete and saying that those Marines made by the Emperor himself were worse than what some toaster-fetishist could come up with.
