AskWomen,ff6khuy,t1_ff60g1h,1579629139.0,Wow this is a REALLY cool story. I'd love to hear updates from you as this happens. He sounds like a really nice person too. Congrats on your upcoming arrival :)

HomeImprovement,fevexvk,t1_fev9u1f,1579396590.0,"I am actually moving out in less than a month because I've had some disagreements with the manager (she is not the owner, it's a big complex owned by some private party). They twice entered my apartment without notice or even knocking and the owners are letting me out of my lease early because of these complaints and the fact that they should really be in huge trouble for that. 

They downplay my concerns about the wall, and I have no made a formal complaint yet. I guess since it is a safety issue, I should contact the city or health department with the complaint? I'd like to wait to do this once I'm out because the maintenance guy and the manager are really mean."

aww,feplgr9,t1_fepi3us,1579323613.0,"She became ""absolutely terrified "" when the baby cried, while being alone w the dog. The dog is the reason she wrote this post. There is no other reason she became terrified to go pee and have her baby let out a cry. All is nice because she came back and the dog was being cute. I have a mini beagle, never terrified it would bite a baby. She is, yet she left her baby alone."
aww,fepk21a,t1_fepiuhf,1579322525.0,It was an honest question. This poster said they left their baby to pee and became terrified. Indicates they were talking about the baby and dog being alone. I was wondering if that person knowingly left the baby while being aware the dog shouldn't be alone w the baby.
aww,fephl9a,t1_fepcelk,1579320691.0,You were terrified of the dog possibly doing something to the baby but you left them alone?

fasting,fe5kipq,t1_fe0afiv,1578870588.0,Very interesting. I'm a little less than you in weight and one inch taller. 20 lbs.... how noticeable was that in your clothes? Lots of water or considerable size difference ?

aww,fdpek4j,t1_fdoxx9a,1578626608.0,That's how I feel about Korea. Still smells the same every time I get out of the airport since I was 2 years old. I'm 38. It doesn't smell like that anywhere else I have been. It's some type of pollution but I'm so fond of it because of the childhood memories in that country.

Which is kind of annoying. I understand rules but this is almost funny how rigid the dude is. You are a laid back clan?"

worldnews,fdcs2a8,t1_fdbcna8,1578282684.0,"Whoa. Its almost as if these people are not the way our media portrays them, and are defending themselves against our military while knowing the American people don't deserve to suffer from Trump's war crimes."
worldnews,fdc2tuq,t1_fd5inu5,1578265986.0,"Congrats on acing your test. Yes, pls spread the word that Americans did not vote this man into office. He lost the popular vote by over 3 million and won because of our archaic electoral college system. I have 3 boys. I've always been anti war tho. We have more in common than we think and no one wants to send their kids to die for this maniac idiot president."

worldnews,fcpc0ju,t1_fcoptct,1577857725.0,"Thanks for the in depth explanation. Sounds like you guys have it just as bad as us. I'm thankful I live in California, but my vote doesn't mean shit compared to the bumfuck red states which are way less populated."
worldnews,fcok9k3,t1_fcnknw8,1577834347.0,Wasting the money is better than causing more fires w the fireworks.
worldnews,fcok5ic,t1_fcnjxin,1577834265.0,"Are Australians out in the streets protesting this awful shit? Their PM almost sounds worse than Trump. As an American, I'm quite sure if Trump was hosting a fireworks party in a burning state, many americans would be there in protest, and still a bunch of foreign redditors would be talking shit about us not having enough protesters. What's Australia doing about this? Honest question as I know nothing about Australian politics."

stopdrinking,fblypul,t1_fbltsoo,1576973772.0,"As for the fasting/meditation- How long are your fasts for and do you use an app for meditation?

CONGRATS on giving up on smoking. I worked in hospitals for over 10 years as an RN and I have seen a lot of people on their deathbeds from lung cancer. It's usually a relatively young age -60s. You can bet they regret all the years of smoking. You just saved yourself from that. Super proud of anyone that quits smoking, it's SO difficult. I did it 11 years ago."
