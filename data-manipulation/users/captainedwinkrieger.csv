Not that he isn't capable of being a badass (Starship Mine is a perfect example of this), I just think having him be Space Bruce Willis like he was in the Next Gen movies would be really stupid."

In GoT there's this big ice wall that separates the kingdom from this area that was once home to snow zombies, but since that time is (as far as most characters know) long gone, that area's just inhabited by wildlings, who are basically just scavengers. I'd recommend the show. The first 4 seasons are great, 5-7 are a constant decline in quality, and 8 is like being smothered by a pillow made of disappointment."
