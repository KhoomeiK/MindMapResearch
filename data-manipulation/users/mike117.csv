awfuleverything,ffdp7n3,t1_ffdnyij,1579825693.0,For real. I wonder what’s actually very public in this persons mind.
rarepuppers,ffdp1xo,t1_ffcmb1k,1579825594.0,Pitties have some of the most expressive faces. I wish I could meet more of them but I guess they’re not ver well liked :(
BoJackHorseman,ffdkwj8,t1_ffcypll,1579823048.0,"I thought she was holding a gun and that was the muzzle flash. I did a double take in whether this was really a Bojack before I went back and looked at the “gun” again.

Edit: From other comments in this thread, I now realize she is not cleaning the windows either."
Botchedsurgeries,ffdkczc,t1_ffd63hc,1579822719.0,Honestly this is the only thing I can see here. Someone who doesn’t see the good in themselves.

PublicFreakout,ffa5dwp,t1_ff95oti,1579728214.0,"This is in Brazil. I don’t remember the amount of money we would be paying but we were definitely poor at the time. I got turned away at three separate hospitals when I had a tiny shard of glass stuck in my eyeball. 

The third hospital recommended we try the first one. Paraíba, I will always think of it fondly, but I will never go back to living there."

AskReddit,feq1pn3,t1_fepr4v6,1579336199.0,You’re probably just really good at reading non-verbal cues. Couple that with a good guessing ability and I’d imagine many people would think you’re a psychic.
AskReddit,feq1ikf,t1_feprnpt,1579336104.0,Holy shit I have these exact symptoms (among others ofc). I had an early diagnosis of borderline personality disorder but it was left unconfirmed. Almost makes me want to go back to therapy.
AskReddit,feq18dq,t1_fepqgfm,1579335953.0,Pot has been known to increase anxiety just as much as it can reduce. It varies wildly from person to person.
