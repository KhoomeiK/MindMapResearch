I thought OP was me, but you are also me.

I'm doing IF, and I did notice also that once I start I can't stop. I end up eating a lot of snacks, and then still dining.

I decided to try to push the fast window as late as possible, and simply open the eating window with an early dinner. I think 1500 cal of stuff should last me till I go to sleep.

In my country we are used to dining at around 10-11pm, unlike the US where they seem to dine MUCH earlier, so it's a bit harder, but I'm trying to adapt to this haha"

This person is completely new to anime AFAIK, so I feel like she will miss a ton of the movie and it will just seem a ""weird movie"""

AskCulinary,ff6lnw7,t1_ff6l60n,1579629847.0,Aren't those basically the same but different brand?
AskCulinary,ff6iyli,t1_ff6et0t,1579628203.0,"It's not marketing jargon, it's rough translation by me. In spanish it's hierro estampado/prensado (pressed iron).

Not sure about the technical differences, but we normally have ""fundicion de hierro"" (cast iron) and this new ones that are just hierro estampado. The word for steel (acero) or carbon (carbono) are never mentioned in their name or website in spanish.

I did not know they where called ""carbon steel"" at all, sorry!"

edit: I checked the subs, and apparently they are going international. You have no idea how hard that is for angentinian companies, specially small ones. Kudos to them!"

Will check the subs!"
