you can’t listen to a book about physics, only if it’s a popular science book by Hawking or else, which is particularly designed to cater to an audience that is not interested in actual formula, which is physics, but just some cool anecdotes out of it.

if you’d listen to a physics book it would be something like R mu nu minus one half g mu nu R equals 8 pi gravitational constant divided by c to the power of 4 times T mu nu ... that’d get complicated very soon..."

aww,ffyedwp,t1_ffxq7v2,1580344424.0,"It’s a natural mutation, which was purposefully bred by some weird people in like 2010, who thought they could make money out of it. While OP’s cat just hit the Lykoi jackpot, there are quite some people who support the targeted breeding of this mutation. 

These cats are prone to develop skin conditions, get sun burns,  have problems staying warm and have oily skin - because of their lacking fur. On the other hand, they do not seem to have any health issues other than that and their whiskers are not absent like in some sphinx cats, but most of these cats, which mostly come from these breeders, just came into an age  where typical breeding related health issues would start to appear, so we‘ll soon learn about the consequences of the mutation soon I guess :)"
