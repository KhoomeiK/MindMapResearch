relationships,fe2xez7,t3_enn6w5,1578843952.0,"I dont disagree with your friend, everyone seems to want to broadcast all that's wrong with them.  Obv. You are  not a low IQ person.  And I'm sure you are strong willed, (ie. Achieving goals/education) and you've lived your life this far w/o the knowledge that you even had a disability.   

Myself; knowing people with stronger physical and mental disabilities, suggest you do  not over react to your friends playfulness about the subject.  IF YOU make light of it and joke about it, then it opens the door for others to do so as well.

Be gracious that otherwise; you are a healthy/happy motivated individual.

Good luck!
