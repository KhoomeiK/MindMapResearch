1. I was headed to my parent’s house from College for the weekend. I got into my car and I suddenly realized I was in my parent’s driveway. I got very scared because I’d apparently just driven 1 and a half hours and I don’t recall it one bit. Then I look at my clock and it had only been 10 minutes. So apparently my vehicle and I teleported. Still freaks me out.

2. I was driving on a highway separated by a median. There were no cars around me and I had the cruise control set to the speed limit. I suddenly get a tingly sensation in the back of my neck and alarms are going off in my head to slow down. I back off to about 20-25 MPH below the limit looking around to see... nothing.
I’m self assessing to try and figure out why I just had a sudden onset of dread for about 5-10 seconds. Then a sedan comes careening across the median from the other highway lanes and basically ramps over the road about 30-50 feet in front of me. I gather my nerves pull over, And call 911, and run back to this car. 
The driver was having convulsions and not responding. There were 3 other cars that saw what happened and one guy was an off duty paramedic, so we backed off and let him handle her until the ambulance could arrive. Everyone said they saw me braking before anything in the other lane happened, and I told them I just had a feeling. They looked just as wigged out by it as me."
