Basically there’s a small window after blocking an attack that you can counter attack while still blocking.

He’s great for taking our clone commandos with their crazy health. Stick with your troops, let them focus on enemy troops, helping when you can, but don’t go chasing groups of enemy soldiers in the open. If you get a bunch of guys close together in a room, use duelist and fuck em up. He gets more dodges than anyone so utilize that, don’t use expose weakness when you’re out in the open or against large groups, it’s not worth the damage you’ll take while exposed to single out one target.

natureismetal,feo0h48,t1_fentovo,1579293501.0,"I would guess it stings pretty good. Unless you don’t think it has pain receptors in the first inch of its skin. Also that is “breaking the skin” it’s breaking several layers of it, because that’s how skin works. If a cat claws you, it hasn’t ripped through your skin to the muscle, but it has broken several layers of skin and it likely stings. Same thing here at the very least, although I’d imagine even that’s underselling it cuz they’re goddamn lions. That hippo is gonna have some scars, and it’s a tough bastard but it’s gonna feel more pain than is comfortable. I’m not sure why you’re so insistent that 3 apex predators are incapable of harming a small hippo"
natureismetal,fent95x,t1_fenmthi,1579290469.0,"Right which has just as tough if not tougher skin than a hippo. I’m not sure why you people are convinced that animals with thick hide don’t have nerve endings in their skin. How would that be advantageous from an evolutionary standpoint. The thick hide protects from more serious damage but the animal still needs to know if there’s a cat standing on its back biting it. If they were impervious to pain from lions why would the hippo even care to run. No it’s got 3 giant fucking cats clawing the shit out of it and it hurts. Your skin is thick enough to be protect you from life threatening damage from a house cat clawing or biting you, but it still fuckin smarts doesn’t it?"
natureismetal,fensvk7,t1_fenqad9,1579290243.0,It’s not common but it certainly happens. Lions prides that are big enough sometimes take down lonely elephants. Hippos are the most dangerous mammal on that continent but that doesn’t mean they’re invincible and can’t feel pain
natureismetal,fenkr90,t1_fenj85l,1579286787.0,"A lions claws can be like an inch long, they kill large game with their faces for a living, they can break the skin enough to hurt a hippo. The hippo may be far more immune to minor grazes than an antelope but if it’s got lions hanging on it odds are that shit stings. The skin on our hands can be pretty tough and callused and still get gnarly paper cuts. That’s also not like the biggest hippo in the world, it looks fairly young to me, but I’m no expert. Anyways I’m almost certain there’s not many creatures on the planet that’s gonna get bit by several lions and “not feel it”,"
natureismetal,feni2ik,t1_fenh39c,1579285152.0,"Thick enough to avoid serious damage yea, but that doesn’t mean they won’t feel pain from their skin getting split open. A paper cut can hurt right?
