The kingdom of Mali was absolutely AWESOME.  All the gold Europe had during the Medieval period came from Africa.  Mansa Musa, or Musa I, of Mali was freaking LOADED, and is figured to be the richest man in history because of all the gold Mali produced.  European countries could only *dream* of the wealth Mali had. \*smirks\*  Other great empires and kingdoms that deserve just as much honor and glory as European dynasties get (if not more) : Kush, Timbuktu, Great Zimbabwe, Kerma, Numidia, Benin, and the Zulu, to name only a few.  Ethiopia is the only country in Africa to *never* have been colonized by a European power (so far as I know).  Italy tried.  The Ethiopian Orthodox Church is one of the oldest forms of Christianity (the art is gorgeous and worth appreciating for its own sake).  Christianity came to northeastern African years before it came to Europe."

ChoosingBeggars,ffs59cx,t1_ffos34i,1580173466.0,"Great mindset!  My dad tried to push me into a mold.  He wasn't trying to make me like himself, he was intent on trying to push me into being what he thought I wanted to be based on what I'd said as a small kid.

I said I wanted to be a vet when I was in 2nd grade, and, I guess, when I didn't deviate from that after a few years, or maybe even one year (or a few months), his mind got locked on 'My daughter's going to be a vet when she grows up' and that's the spiel he proudly told everyone for years and years and years.  Lucky for him, I continued to want to be a vet until about freshman/sophomore year of high school, when the musical theatre bug bit REALLYHARD and I decided I Absolutely Wanted So Much to go into theatre and major in theatre in college.  He was against that for various reasons (some of them legit) and refused to even consider letting me access the money set aside for my education if that's what I wanted to do.  I'm sure he was so very happy when I decided not to do theatre (in a nutshell, my dream died a hard, fast, painful death when it hit the hard wall of Ugly Reality), and  he returned to pushing The Veterinary Dream.  

I slightly altered my goal and focused on becoming a vet tech (can do everything a vet does except diagnose, prognose, prescribe, and perform surgery).  My dad, so long set on my being a vet, had it in his head I'd become a vet tech and then go on to vet school--even though I told him, repeatedly, I DID NOT WANT TO BE A VET, FULL STOP.  I didn't.  I did not want to put animals down and I did not want to perform surgery (the joke ended up being on me with both of those; you absolutely put down animals as a tech, and I had a small taste of doing surgery in tech school and it wasn't so bad.  Still didn't want to be a vet, though).  DID NOT WANT TO BE A VET.  Words went in one ear and out the other.

At the end of my first semester of vet tech school, my GPA wasn't the greatest, at least as far as I was concerned.  My father was also not impressed.  ""You'll never get into vet school with this GPA!"" he exclaimed when he saw the report (I wasn't yet at the point of being able to tell him to piss off, and he *was* kind of in control of the $$ that paid tuition and books and stuff, so...yeah).  

I exclaimed, frustrated he *still* hadn't gotten it through his head, ""I don't *want* to go to vet school!""

He looked stunned.  ""You don't?!?""

""No! I don't!""

""Oh.""

After graduating vet tech school, I lasted as a tech 14 months.  I liked doing the work, but it turned out to not be the career for me, so I decided to go back to school, focus on zoology and zookeeping, give that area a try.  I thought my getting out of being a vet tech because everything had gone south and having very little to do with the field had gotten across to my dad I was DONEDONEDONE with veterinary medicine and my focus now was zookeeping.  I'd been saying I was Done With Veterinary Medicine and I Wanted to Be a Zookeeper, a clear message that my friends, family, and mother had no trouble understanding, but my father's issues with hearing and listening...yeah.  He also did not seem to understand that the AAS I'd gotten in Veterinary Sciences and the AAS I'd gotten in Zoo Technology did not add up to a bachelors degree (I had that conversation with him multiple times) and, yes, I really *did* need to transfer to Michigan State to do a bachelors in Zoology.  I truly thought he'd Gotten The Message.  I'd been out of the field for years--but he hadn't. \*headwall\*

I had to drop out of Michigan State Because Money, and because wages were shit in my hometown, I decided, reluctantly, to do some part-time vet tech work for a vet I'd worked for right out of vet tech school.  It was a small practice, so it wasn't that busy and was the right speed for me to get back into working as a tech.  My first day there, an experienced tech was supposed to be keeping an eye on me and checking what I was doing, but she didn't check one Very Important Thing I did, which had SERIOUS consequences.  I have no idea why I wasn't checked.  I should have been.  It was decided that blame was on multiple parties, and that was the end of me working there.  I told my parents a shortened version of what happened and that I wasn't working there anymore, and my dad said something to the effect of, ""Maybe you should go back to school and find something else to do besides this veterinary thing"".  

I was *FLOORED*.  Literally jaw limp and hanging open, shocked, could not believe what I was hearing because this was *how many years* after I had done **exactly that**.  I was also pissed, because what the hell had I just been doing for the past decade-ish?  Aye carumba!  

""What do you think I've *been* doing?"" I said.  Being **Totally Done** with him Not Getting It--so far past burned out with him never hearing and never listening and not having a damn clue, I was a metaphorical pile of pure carbon dust--I let him hear all the annoyance and scorn I felt in my voice.  He had the look of someone who's just been made aware they totally missed something very important.  \*rolls eyes hard\*"

ChoosingBeggars,fdm233y,t3_elvug2,1578537969.0,"I used to work as a vet tech, and people like this CB infuriate me.  Not just because they want veterinary professionals to do our thing for free, but because they're totally ignoring something glaringly obvious: SUPPLIES AREN'T FREE.  ELECTRICITY ISN'T FREE.  THE BUILDING ISN'T FREE.  Every single person there could volunteer their time and services, and there would still be costs--costs that would have to be passed on to the clients so the clinic/hospital could stay in operation.  Vets have zero control over how much vaccines; cotton swabs; surgical gowns; radiograph film; FeLV tests; neoprene gloves; penicillin; and everything else used in the clinic/hospital costs from suppliers.  Zero, zilch, nada, none.  They can shop around, but that's it.  They can shop around for computers and, maybe, lab equipment.  The vet has no control over how much the utilities charge per unit/service.  None.

Vets will, within reason, do the best they can to work with you and your financial situation.  They want, so very much, to help your pet be the bestest, healthiest, happiest, most contentest cat/doggo/\[species\] ever in the history of the world, cross my heart and hope to die, I swear on a stack of Bibles and my gramma's grave.  If they could work for free, they would--well, some are greedy assholes and wouldn't, but the majority would.  Speaking for vet techs, if we could do what we do and not have to be paid, that would be fine, because you don't go into this field--and stay--because of money.  You leave damn fast if you're in it for the money, because there are days (so many days) there isn't enough money to stick around (speaking for all vet professionals on that).

The vets (and the rest of the staff) were absolutely THRILLED to have the opportunity to slim the dog down--and we did.  When we closed for lunch, the dog had the run of the back of the clinic and people played with him and he was walked at least twice a day.  He was also on a carefully measured diet of prescription weight loss kibble (he was Not Amused to be deprived of the fried people food).  As the weight came off, the crankiness decreased and he became a very playful, silly doggo who looked forward to lunchtime funtimes and having the opportunity to run around the backyard in the morning and late afternoon/evening.
