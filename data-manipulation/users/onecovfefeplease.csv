BDSMcommunity,ffph4qx,t1_ffpgcqe,1580094915.0,"hmm, if that's the case, then I think the easiest set I can think of if you don't have a frame is to buy some braided nylon rope and do a DIY under-mattress restraint.  Essentially, it's two pieces of rope long enough to wrap under your mattress; one will be for the wrists, the other for the ankles.  I'm not a fan of the web strap sets off amazon since the straps stretch pretty easily and are kindof ugly IMO.  But soft silky smooth diamond-braided nylon is easy to work with and doesn't chafe or bind as easily as hemp/jute.  Then you just learn a few restraint knots/loops and make sure you buy enough rope to go under the mattress, up the sides, over to the individual's wrists/ankles, and enough working length to tie your makeshift cuffs.  That would cost you less than $20 (plus a lighter to make the cut ends of the nylon rope all pretty and fray-proof)."
BDSMcommunity,ffpg4hg,t3_eu1mxe,1580094205.0,"What's your budget? Do you have a wooden bed frame? I've found that my favorite bed restraint system is to screw three rope loops each to the left and right sides of the bed frame as well as two at the headboard and two at the footboard (Home Depot, aisle 14 or whatever aisle is the rope and fasteners).  Then you pick up double-ended bolt snaps and nylon braided rope.  It'll cost you about 45min and less than $100 for a high quality, strong, and safe setup where you don't have to worry about questionable materials or long shipping times.

I placed the rope loops on my bed frame so that you can't see them when the bed is made.  Of my 100ft of rope, I cut it into 5 sections (4 short ones to anchor my wrists and ankles to the rope loops and one long section for my Dom with which he can use his ""artistic license"").  For my setup, I tied bolt snaps to each end of the short ropes for quick and easy fastening to my leather restraint cuffs, but if you don't already have a set, then I'd recommend either learning a few quick-release knots or spending $50+ dollars on a nice leather set (cheap leather, leatherette, and vegan leather don't always have the holding power of genuine leather and it'll wear out faster, so don't shy away from a quality set).  I'll upload pics if you like."
NoStupidQuestions,ffp835u,t3_eugf73,1580088573.0,"First of all, if you are happy with your hair then to hell with what your friends think.  Not everyone can have the same hair care routine because not everyone has the same scalp and hair needs.  

Second, you'll just have to experiment with different products and showering routines to see what makes your hair look and feel its best.  Sometimes scalps are oily because they don't get washed enough, other times it's because they get washed too frequently, or maybe it's not your hair products but it's your diet instead.  Same thing with dry or flaky scalps.  There's no cut-and-dry solution to hair care.  If you were looking for advice, I'd go to Ulta or another salon (not Hair Cuttery or Great Clips or MasterCuts and other cheaper places) to make an appointment and talk to a stylist about your hair concerns and how to handle them.

In their defense though, if you're shampooing with crappy drugstore shampoo like VO5 every day then yes there's a chance you're removing good oils from your hair."

AskReddit,ffjh14a,t1_ffjgnh8,1579998062.0,"LOL! if you're going with someone, then I'd say whatever pans out to be about 6 hours of driving per person. All that luxury of vehicle storage space is soooo worth not worrying about some schmuck running off with my board before I get to the baggage claim.  Plus, factoring in split cost of gas and windshield wiper fluid vs ticket cost can help the decision.

AskReddit,ffjfcxi,t3_etyq86,1579997070.0,"Depends on why I'm going.  If it's snowboarding, I'll drive up to 10 hours before I decide to fly and check my snowboard as luggage... I worry about my snowboard getting lost or damaged and I don't like paying for a rental since my truck is 4WD.  Plus, I can take all my frivolous stuff like my favorite down blanket, extra fuzzy pajamas, sheepskin slippers, etc. since I don't have to check/carry any heavy luggage.   If I'm just visiting someone and the drive is difficult or boring, the cutoff is usually around 5 hours of drive time."
ReefTank,ffjeuhx,t3_etyqfb,1579996769.0,"Aiptasia.  Be aware that if a fragment of it remains in the tank or if it broke off a piece during the removal process, you'll see more aiptasia somewhere else in your tank in a week or so.  If it's just one or two, try injecting it in its stalk with hot water and lemon juice.  If you have a ton of them and you've got the room/appropriate tankmates, try a peppermint shrimp (fun to watch and they're voracious aiptasia eaters)."

AskReddit,ffj0rjb,t3_etwlbo,1579987491.0,"If you don't have the time, then don't bother.  I've rushed a shave job too many times and the razor burn looks worse than if I'd gone stubbly or worn leggings/hose. 

My routine: sit in hot bath for 20 min. Shave slowly with a 5-blade razor and a shave cream (like Bromley's, Cremo, Eos, etc.). Olive oil works too.  Rinse, pat dry, apply aftershave (like TendSkin).  Wait 5min, then apply coconut oil.  Exfoliate 2 days after you shave.

Also, water is a terrible lubricant.  Do not shave any body parts under the water, that's a straight shot to nicksville on the U.S.S. FML Express"
