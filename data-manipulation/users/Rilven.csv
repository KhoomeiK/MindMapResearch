She eventually started fucking navy dudes at a nearby base. She ended up getting involved with a guy who was a superficial ass. She tried bringing him home and inviting him to family functions to make it look like she really like him, all an act to make the first guy jealous. Eventually the navy dude stopped coming by and we assumed they broke it off. Years later after a ton of other drama me and the first guy are talking. He lets it slip that my sister and navy guy got married and when things turned sour they filed for divorce. I’m pretty sure I’m not supposed to know and the other members of my family are either oblivious or refuse to speak about it."

One FNM I brought my gf to the store and the owner legit told my gf to break up with me because I played shit home brew decks which meant I was “ok with being a loser”.

On many occasions I would come in with a new deck and the self proclaimed “nice guy” of the store would look at it and say, “do you just not like winning?” instead of actually giving me advice. When I asked seasoned players for help one of them told me that the considerate thing to do after I lost was to drop from the event so I would hurt other people’s records.

Enough horror stories, time for the nice one and my last FNM at that store. (It closed. Good riddance.)
I was at FNM and I was losing horribly every game. Bad draws, bad matchups and my opponents popping off and calling me trash. I almost cried I was so pissed. Last game of the night. Terrible first hand, mulligan to 6. Opponent mulligans too. Another bad hand. Mulligan to 5, pissed. Opponent mulligans again. Terrible hand AGAIN. I exclaim, “are you fucking me! Got to 4!”. Opponent sighs and goes to 4. Then we make eye contact. We both smile. We both mulligan to 3. Then to 2. Then 1. We both keep and we’re both laughing like idiots. Asshole player comes to our table and asks “what the hell are you morons doing?” I respond “Shut up. This is the only fun I’ve had all night.”

There is no shortage of shitty players but in my opinion, the good interactions make it all worth it. It’s how I met my best friends."
