notliketheothergirls,ffpb88g,t1_ffktxya,1580090726.0,"My husband had an encounter too, the missus of one of his band mates. She had finished her tattoo sleeve on one arm and proud of it (nothing wrong with that), but she said: “I’m not like the other girls, i love tattoos. This is why i got a full sleeve!”
She’s your typical blonde sweetheart (no fillers, all natural and she’s a hair stylist), short: Average and normal. Again, nothing wrong with that!
The amusing part of the situation and what it made funnier for us: I have a bunch of big tattoos from head to toe. Not literally a body suit, for example a full sleeve and a half sleeve. In short: way more than her.

It’s more wholesome and funny than bitchy and putting others down.

And to add:
I don’t think i’m cooler or better than others with less or no tattoos! It’s a personal preference and choice, nothing to define personality over. It was just witty that she made that statement exactly to the guy with the ‘heavily’ tattooed wife. :)

Edit: missing punctuation"

Disgusting and dehumanising. Actually it’s a very similar mindset to the nazi view about everyone not being a straight, healthy caucasian to be a subhuman being. TO YOUR OWN CHILD!

I hope you don’t speak out of experience, no one deserves shit like that.

I’m not even a parent or LGBT+, but it’s just fucking common sense to see a human just as a human. Not gender nor ethnicity should matter, just the person themselves.

Reference photos are always a big help, in this case underwater photography. Light in water is actually not too hard to draw in black and white, as soon as you figured out how the flow works.
The tip with the lines and highlights was one of the first i got. Using more black took me some brave (you know how it is, the fear of ruining it, because the darker, the less chance to correct), but it’s gold and adds depth.
Maybe scan or use the photo of your artwork and play around a little with contrast, blackpoint, brightness and so on. So you have a safe game to find out what’s needed without risking the actual drawing.

Again: It’s a great piece! I love how you mixed aspects of insects with sea life. The anatomy has a perfect flow and everything fits together."
drawing,ffj1xbe,t3_etwyum,1579988334.0,"First off: This is really great work!
But since you ask for constructive criticism: Work on clearer (darker, sharper) lines and set more highlights. Can be done with a white gel pen or with a good eraser. That brings more dynamic and life to the picture.
If you want to go crazy, try to draw light plays in the water (keep a narrow gradient around Leviathan, so he stays in focus).

But seriously, the picture is already amazing. Good job!"
