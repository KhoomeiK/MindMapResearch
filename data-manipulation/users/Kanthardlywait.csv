In either event my comment wasn't for you but to highlight for others that the political narratives that the establishment push ( such as Tulsi being some right wing secret LGBTQ hating foreign government operative ) are more than just silly nonsensical rantings. They are designed to erode the publics ability to see the issues, to obfuscate reality, and plants seeds of doubt about those that are truly trying to better our country.

It is insidious and it is CULTIVATED. It is a key component for the ruling class to keep power by keeping the workers divided so they don't unite to see who is their real enemy. 

The internet provides the barrier of anonymity which frees what might otherwise be someone too cowardly to voice their rage in person and lets them shout their vile ichor without fear of having to confront those they demonize directly. 

When it comes to racism I look to the teachings of a small handful of men to show us how to be better. Fred Hampton, Dr Martin Luther King jr, and Mister Fred Rogers.

I think even the most skeptical can look at 2016 and see that isn’t the case at all. The DNC committed rampant election fraud in multiple states for the primaries and, regardless of your political leanings, Trump did not win the popular vote but was appointed by those who went against the will of the people in the Electoral College. 

In fact if you look at our constitution, the popular vote doesn’t have anything to do with the presidential election. 

Should the EC fail to appoint a president with two-thirds majority ( I believe it is ) then the decision goes to the speaker of the house who can appoint anyone they want. There is no legal requirements for them to base their choices on anything to do with the popular vote or even pick someone that was in the running. Legally they can appoint their cousin Phil without breaking any laws. 

To say that the will of the people still holds sway is naive at best."

I drove to the corner store. Not even a minute drive. As I got about halfway there I started sweating and my body started making those bubbly rumbles that foretell of dire events to come. I had little choice and pressed on. I quickly grabbed the one item I needed and got in line behind two other customers. The first was at the counter and finishing up. The next had a cart full of miscellaneous items and was being pushed by a young child. I swore internally and tried to ignore the growing discomfort in my gut. 

Then an angel appeared before me without any fanfare, no trumpets or divine light, not even a smile on her lips. “You can go ahead of me”. 

I don’t know if it was the sight of a sweaty man standing behind her, the fact that I only held one item, or if it was because that one item was a large bundle of toilet paper but at that moment I willed the universe to shower her in riches. With a very sincere thank you I stepped in front of her and hastily made my purchase, quickly making my way out and back home.
