aww,ffulrg2,t1_ffsm11k,1580244642.0, Thanks. I figured she was one.
UnresolvedMysteries,ffuln7u,t3_ev76pn,1580244569.0, Glad to know another Doe has been identified. It always pleases me when that happens.
aww,ffs9i9n,t1_ffrykex,1580176426.0, I think blue tick coonhound.
UnsolvedMysteries,ffs8hfg,t1_ffquwkf,1580175727.0, Great...we just have to hope the police will give the DNA evidence to scientists eventually. Hopefully in the next few years technology will be advance enough to get a sample from such a small amount of evidence.
UnresolvedMysteries,ffqub5l,t1_ffqezbd,1580143807.0,"Me too. Glad to know that he’ll be buried by family. It’s been a long time for his family to go without answers.

Edit: I hope his work has survived. It would be great to create a small exhibition of his art. I remember seeing an episode of History Detectives where one of them actually managed to find the painter of a piece of art made in one of the camps that housed Japanese-Americans during WWII. It was a really sweet episode because the artist got to meet up with the guy who found his painting."
UnsolvedMysteries,ffp2iqs,t1_fflsckt,1580084877.0," Poor family. Elena’s kids probably needed a lot of therapy after losing both parents in a span of years when they were young. And I agree this case, with advancements in technology, we could identify the killer. Was there any semen found in Elena? If the killer didn’t use a condom he could’ve left semen which could be used to create a genetic profile of the killer and thus identify him."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffp25y6,t3_eu8hc5,1580084661.0,Her poor step-dad. He’s lost two people and he still doesn’t have answers to his step-daughter’s murder. Has the boyfriend ever been investigated. Perhaps he was involved with something shady and Lelauni was part of a double hit? I would definitely look into the boyfriend’s friends and associates in great detail.
aww,ffjg2dn,t3_etrzpz,1579997495.0, I would happily give this good pup plenty of cookies.
aww,ffjftlw,t1_ffiudij,1579997349.0, That’s true. Freya is said to have her chariot pulled by a pair of cats and thus they are considered sacred to her.
UnsolvedMysteries,ffiqqux,t1_ffi1qou,1579980359.0, We can always hope.
UnresolvedMysteries,ffiqn11,t3_ethtsd,1579980285.0, I feel like these victims can be identified by genetic genealogy and that they were the victims of abusive partners.
UnresolvedMysteries,fffz7o6,t1_feiqh6h,1579895016.0, That too.
UnresolvedMysteries,fffz70l,t1_fecqjfd,1579895005.0,Rembrandt’s a bigger name than Titan. He’s more recognizable by people than Titian. Everyone can name the Nightwatch as a famous piece by Rembrandt.
UnsolvedMysteries,fffyydj,t1_ffa1vkl,1579894857.0, We could identify them via genetic genealogy. All it would take is finding collateral descendants or else distant cousins of the bodies and from there we could trace the lineage until we reach a match for the DNA.
aww,ffewf4s,t3_et6ari,1579868328.0,The floofest cloud I have ever seen.
UnresolvedMysteries,ff7u88f,t1_ff49uu0,1579658484.0,That too. It was partially deforestation by people which was helped by the rats. Important lesson here: never introduce an invasive species for you’ll have another Rapa Nui.
UnresolvedMysteries,ff3nw03,t3_erfm6z,1579545071.0," The old stories from Rapa Nui, regarding the moai, all say they walked to their places. This could mean that somehow the people dragged the moai via ropes. At one point in time Rapa Nui was covered in forests and it’s believed that one of the reasons why the moai builders’ civilization collapsed is because of the introduction of rats, by the original settlers, who ate the seeds of trees before they could germinate and sprout."
UnresolvedMysteries,fetnym4,t1_fepfho5,1579377409.0," Thanks. It’s just something I came up with a while back and as I look more and more at the book the more convinced I am that this theory is the most plausible one. If you look at what was going on at a time when an item was created it can reveal details about why the item was created. Also in the manuscript itself there’s a sketch of a town that has walls with dove tail crenellations. While it’s possible the book was created in Florence I don’t know if Florence’s walls ever had dovetail crenellations and the depiction of the women just screams International Gothic-late Gothic influence which would be commonly seen in Venice and Milan, not really much in Florence. I excluded Venice as a possible candidate because the Venetian republic had long relied on the lagoon to protect the city from invaders and as far as I can tell Venice has never had dovetail crenellations on its buildings. So the most likely point of origin for the Voynich manuscript is Milan, possibly in the possession of an alchemist who worked for the Visconti family."
UnresolvedMysteries,feoqkl3,t3_eq0404,1579304035.0,"My theory about why it hasn’t been deciphered is because the book is an alchemical notebook written in code for various reasons which could include preventing a rival alchemist from stealing personalized recipes to protection from the Catholic Church. Beginning in the 15th century witch hunts were conducted by the Catholic Church and later the Protestant church and alchemists could face harsh punishments if their work was confiscated. They often relied on the protect of ruling families to prevent them becoming another statistic but in exchange they needed to produce results. 

As it happens the date range for the creation of the Voynich manuscript falls within the start of the witch hunts so this could be the notebook of a court alchemist, most likely for Milan which had ties to the Valois family of France via marriage (a member of the Valois family married a Visconti and a member of the Valois family married a Visconti). The artwork does resemble, to me, a rough usage of the International Gothic-Late Gothic style popular in France at the time combined with the development of influences sneaking in from Tuscany with the detailed depiction of the plants. So basically I believe this might be an alchemist’s notebook, perhaps one of a few that have survived."
aww,fei18nl,t1_feh8r30,1579128076.0, So cute. I have a totaro stuffie.
UnresolvedMysteries,fehl3kh,t1_feez1kf,1579118736.0, I always hope that he’ll be identified soon. It will be nice to give him his name back. I just hope his abuser(s) are suffering in the afterlife.
UnresolvedMysteries,fehkw0y,t1_fegq5xb,1579118616.0, Good to hear.
UnresolvedMysteries,feelzb0,t1_fedk5d8,1579036452.0, I think we’ll be giving her back her identity soon.
UnresolvedMysteries,feb5v8c,t1_feb4578,1578955737.0, Yep. I think that’s what happened to the art. I hope the art can be recovered.
UnresolvedMysteries,feb3uhz,t1_feanwwo,1578955195.0," And I thought anything by Rembrandt was priceless as he is one of the big names of the Old Masters. I mean a fair number of people have heard of Rembrandt so maybe the person behind the theft, the mastermind, wanted bragging rights about owning Rembrandt’s only known seascape."
UnresolvedMysteries,feal7is,t1_feai3fn,1578950004.0, Really there’s a Titan in the Gardner?
aww,feak5e2,t1_fe41u6k,1578949781.0, That is a real story. According to the story a cat decided to take a nap on a piece of clothing Muhammad was wearing. Muhammad wanted to move but he also didn’t want to disturb the cat so he cut a piece of the garb he was wearing and allowed the cat to continue to nap on the cut off piece of cloth. There’s even a brand of cat food that’s halal named for a cat Muhammad was said to be fond of.
UnresolvedMysteries,feahkg1,t1_fe4zaka,1578948868.0," Exactly. This was a meticulously planned heist, almost as if the thieves were given a list of which artworks to target."
UnresolvedMysteries,feahcza,t1_fe97ju0,1578948765.0, That’s scary. Glad to know your grandma and grand-aunt (or is it great aunt) escaped.
UnresolvedMysteries,feah8g8,t1_fe8hxkc,1578948693.0, Wait...I’m from Connecticut as well and I never hear of this case before.
UnresolvedMysteries,fe4yrmp,t1_fe4ww38,1578864088.0," Exactly. The Russian millionaires and billionaires have generally purchased Old Masters and Rembrandt, an Old Master, was among the works of art stolen."
UnresolvedMysteries,fe4y905,t1_fdt7do1,1578863916.0, I feel like this case is solvable. I mean how many people of Korean and Mediterranean ancestry live in Japan? I know that Japan has a significant Korean minority. I think if America and Japan cooperated by having a project like DNA Doe analyze the foreign DNA found in the house we could catch the killer.
UnresolvedMysteries,fe4w4lx,t3_enrwnv,1578863347.0, I have a theory that the art is in the possession of a Russian millionaire or billionaire. It would only be over a year later that the Soviet Union would collapse and millionaires and billionaires started to pop up.
UnresolvedMysteries,fe4v024,t1_fe4oc3r,1578863061.0, I have to agree. My suspicions is that the Voynich manuscript is an alchemy book. Alchemists lived dangerous lives during the 15th and 16th centuries as the Catholic Church was cracking down on people they viewed as black magic users and alchemists lives depended on them producing results for their employers.
UnresolvedMysteries,fdzcovo,t1_fdw9tw0,1578788990.0, Well thanks to advancements in genetic analysis the killer(s) are going to find their perfectly laid plans fall apart. Someone needs to contact DNA Doe about conducting genetic genealogy for the two Does.
UnresolvedMysteries,fdzcdk3,t1_fdt7hex,1578788838.0, I have a feeling his killer was a furious parent/aunt/uncle/grandparent/older sibling who found out about his “activities” and decided that if the law wasn’t going to act and put the son of a bitch away for molestation then they had to deliver justice for their loved one. There’s a reason why there are tropes referring to papa wolves and mama bears. Because both animals are known to be protective of their young.
UnresolvedMysteries,fdzb4fd,t1_fdtco0w,1578788411.0, I have to agree. The bastard is hopefully suffering in one of the many hells. I’m not usually a spiteful person but he was a bastard and he deserves to be punished for his crimes.
UnresolvedMysteries,fdyrmgw,t1_fdwc2sp,1578782831.0, Good to hear. That means there’s a chance the project might take up her case. I mean I read police identified the body of a man who died over a 100 years ago with genetic genealogy so why not a 115 year old Jane Doe?
UnresolvedMysteries,fdwcsab,t3_en2fag,1578757421.0, I’m always happy when a Doe is identified. Also glad to know she was given a proper burial. Now she can be buried by her family. Rest In Peace Shirlene for your name has been returned to you.
aww,fdrqouv,t1_fdq38ym,1578688193.0, I was thinking the same thing.
UnresolvedMysteries,fdrpx2e,t1_fdqesom,1578687960.0, This is where genetic genealogy would come in. If we could find a person who shares at least one allele with the victim and trace the lineage back to the victim’s lifetime we could identify her and return her name. Is there a Canadian equivalent to DNA Doe?
UnresolvedMysteries,fdovxc4,t1_fdogygv,1578614095.0, Yeah. It’s probably too late to catch her killer but not too late to identify her.
aww,fdovtqw,t1_fdoitbr,1578614029.0, And adorable.
aww,fdofag7,t1_fdo09u1,1578604006.0, I saw him on the Dodo.
UnresolvedMysteries,fdof50q,t3_emefqr,1578603934.0, With advancements in DNA analysis we could identify the victim.
UnresolvedMysteries,fdijrnq,t1_fdhsaaq,1578444473.0, I hope the killer is sweating bullets because with genetic genealogy it’s only a matter of time before killers are caught.
UnsolvedMysteries,fdfhzct,t1_fd9lq72,1578362138.0, And great questions to ask. I feel really sorry for the kids. If their mother goes to jail then they’ll lose both parents. I hope they have a strong support network. When their mother gets arrested they’ll need all the love and support they can get. I hope their grandpa gets custody of them.
AnimalsBeingBros,fdfh8yw,t1_fd6y16r,1578361645.0, Very puffy. I want to hug them.
aww,fdfgo4b,t1_fdebbyf,1578361263.0, Quick before the hyena comes.
aww,fddjmhc,t1_fdctkd5,1578314876.0, They love to eat.
aww,fddjhdp,t3_ekoyam,1578314726.0, She’s a beautiful girl. Siamese?
aww,fdc7ogb,t1_fd9p6t3,1578268710.0, I think it is.
UnresolvedMysteries,fdbvldo,t1_fd8zajg,1578262667.0, I can attest to the that. Also at times I swear I can hear my name being called. Spooky thing is this occurs when I’m alone. Basically what I’m saying is that sometimes you hear things that you shouldn’t because of your mind playing tricks on you.
aww,fd5h3ff,t1_fd5fu4f,1578177576.0, I do that too. It’s supposed to help open the sinuses. Also works for cleansing pores.
aww,fct3pbk,t3_eir8a3,1577932069.0,Agreed
aww,fct3b3v,t1_fcpjqrz,1577931778.0, Lucky you. Both are sweethearts.
aww,fct38au,t1_fcpaxgs,1577931720.0, Can I see your bullmastiff? I grew up with them and they are among the best dogs to grow up with.
aww,fct2vfd,t3_eigy1b,1577931449.0, He’s going to be so handsome.
UnresolvedMysteries,fct2c3h,t1_fcsasuc,1577931052.0," Exactly. If anything it probably hurried his decline, although it took him 2 months to die."
UnresolvedMysteries,fcs0kq6,t1_fcrpz3b,1577909501.0, Yeah...I have to agree.
UnresolvedMysteries,fcqrkxq,t1_fcqmie3,1577891112.0," Read about Mercy Brown via Weird New England. And yes you got the facts right about the way to cure “vampirism” but you forgot they also took out her liver and burned it in order to blend the ashes with that of the heart ashes into water. They gave the concoction to her sole surviving sibling, Edwin, but he died two months later."
UnresolvedMysteries,fcqr1q5,t1_fcpmq0m,1577890853.0,"Yep.

Edit: Apparently there a theory that claims that he died because of Delirium Tremens, a condition related to alcoholism that involves people seeing hallucinations. He was known to be a heavy drinker so he might have died because of it."
UnresolvedMysteries,fcos0go,t1_fcnayrn,1577839982.0, He certainly lived a fascinating life. His life would make a fascinating documentary.
UnresolvedMysteries,fcorrw5,t1_fcob7rw,1577839801.0, Exactly. Since forensic technology has become more advanced we could use genetic genealogy to find any living relatives in order to identify them via tracing the lineage back to them.
Bullmastiff,fclo94c,t1_f9pazpv,1577752464.0, Too true.
Bullmastiff,fclo4eb,t1_fcihdm3,1577752374.0, So cute.

UnresolvedMysteries,fclmj4d,t1_fckxbio,1577751288.0, I agree.
UnresolvedMysteries,fckmj1g,t1_fc89l4q,1577728562.0, Alsace has long been a mixture of French and German culture and we know she had possible ties to Bavaria. It could be possible that she learnt the German phrases from her parents while she picked up her handwriting style while in Alsace.
aww,fck2a4o,t3_eha15f,1577714418.0,It’s so adorable. You’re very talented. The time I tried to do anything other than embroidery I wasn’t really good at it.
aww,fck22x4,t1_fciza5n,1577714239.0,Me too.
UnresolvedMysteries,fcihr9e,t1_fci32ip,1577662751.0," I hope so too. The fact they determined the killer is of mixed heritage, specifically what they suspect is Korean and Hispanic, means it would make it easier to find the killer. While Japan does have a sizable Korean minority I don’t think many have Hispanic ancestry in their lineage as well. However it’s likely that the killer was involved somehow with US military. Apparently they determined some sand found in a fanny pack came from a part of California (how they did it I don’t know) and the fact the killer hasn’t been caught could mean they are now outside Japan."
UnresolvedMysteries,fcih440,t1_fch4ch3,1577662448.0, All good questions...
UnresolvedMysteries,fchoc53,t1_fc8ekjn,1577652380.0,This is the likely answer. But why would she smell of garlic? I know about the secretion of garlic scent via sweat but it doesn’t explain why she regularly smelled of garlic. I don’t think traditional Norwegian cuisine uses a lot of garlic and this would be before the new Nordic cuisine movement. Anyone have an idea?
