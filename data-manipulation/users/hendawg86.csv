What the OC is saying is not that off base just because you’ve never experienced it. Most of those that I saw first hand that grew up still believing, had serious mental issues, dependency problems, and delusions of grandeur.

MyChemicalRomance,fg7rwvd,t1_fg7fa3j,1580599941.0,Same. There were four of us in the queue and I happened to get in first. Found four tickets for 200 except that when I went to buy them they changed it to 2 tickets and I bought them before I noticed. Had to wait for another friend to buy two more and they are now in a separate section. Either way though they were selling seats right next to mine for 700 and that was before resale. This whole idea of changing the price to inflate for demand is absolute horseshit and should be illegal. It’s not fair that some one who was waiting for the queue just like everyone is is left with only the option of a ticket that is 3x the price just because the got randomized into a separate purchasing group. It’s absolutely disgusting.

I get it from seeing where it came from but that’s not gonna help you win your own primary. That’s how primaries work. If this type of campaigning worked, party members would always be campaigning outside their party.
