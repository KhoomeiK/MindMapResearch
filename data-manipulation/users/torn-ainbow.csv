The mechanism is not the money collected. In fact you don't need to get any revenue. All the money collected from companies for carbon production can be given directly to the taxpayer as cuts. The only thing that is vitally important for it to work is that carbon costs something to produce. As long as that happens, capitalism will take care of the rest.

No government needs to dictate solutions. Nobody needs to know the correct answers. The market just needs to include carbon as a factor.
