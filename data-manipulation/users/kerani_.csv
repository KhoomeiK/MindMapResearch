unpopularopinion,fgnvpqv,t3_ezkjsd,1580953929.0,She’s a woman. This is definitely going to hurt her career in some form. I listened to the audios and she definitely needs professional help. I feel bad for her. And poor Johnny married her before he saw her true colors.
crochet,fgk4ykg,t3_eyypst,1580857589.0,"This is so disgusting. I’ve seen a lot of crochet designers go through this. I’ll definitely report her but, you might wanna consider watermarking your pictures to make sure it doesn’t happen again."
unpopularopinion,fgk4id2,t3_eyyq1m,1580857311.0,"You make it seem like homophobic people are harmless. It’s more than an “opinion”. Those people who are against homosexuality can vote for conversion therapy and bills that discriminate gay people to the point they can’t have a life. It runs deeper than “I don’t agree with their lifestyle.” If it were just an opinion than they obviously wouldn’t get shamed. When those people think gay people shouldn’t be treated equally, it’s a whole different story."
unpopularopinion,fgg9lwe,t3_eybtky,1580757205.0,It’s only pointless if you’re arguing with someone with a closed mind. People who are open minded and who don’t go too far on either side are reasonable. But both parties need to be respectful when debating politics.

cats,fgena8v,t1_fge96ex,1580703872.0,Okay. Thank you!
unpopularopinion,fge4yn9,t3_exyjl8,1580691478.0,"It should be whatever the mother decides. It’s her body, her choice."
offmychest,fg8d0bw,t1_fg8cu0y,1580615913.0,"Yes it is. Dude, I can go all day on this. I wouldn’t go to police. Police don’t take things that happen on the internet seriously. Lol."
offmychest,fg8cquo,t1_fg8clk0,1580615698.0,Looking at my profile/comment history is stalking. Especially when it’s just for making assumptions and being petty.
offmychest,fg8chqq,t1_fg8cbkm,1580615493.0,Lol. Yeah you did. You admitted to stalking me and now you’re pissed.
offmychest,fg8c97c,t1_fg8c3zf,1580615307.0,"Lmao. You exposed yourself, dude."
offmychest,fg8bwec,t1_fg8bogf,1580615025.0,Lol. I’m not nuts. You were stalking.
offmychest,fg8bjv1,t1_fg8bex2,1580614750.0,"Or maybe you shouldn’t stalk people you disagree with. It’s there for the user. Not for anyone else. It is stalking. And no, your assumptions were not logical."
offmychest,fg8ba6j,t1_fg8b44t,1580614539.0,"Your assumptions are not logical. And yes it is stalking. That’s fucking weird. Like damn, I know some get crazy on here but to literally go through my comments because you don’t agree is weird and fucked up."
offmychest,fg8ayex,t1_fg8a75b,1580614283.0,"Actually it is stalking and just plain desperate. And you only did it to make assumptions and to force your opinion. That’s really immature.  

And no. I’m not a liberal. It’s not deductive. It’s stalking."
