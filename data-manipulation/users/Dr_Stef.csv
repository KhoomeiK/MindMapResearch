Short answer: Outlook Junkmail filter has been 
crap for a long time. The junk is not from cnet but from people who have had your details for a while and obviously got more savvy getting around the filter, disguised as cnet newsletters. 

The suggestion I got from forums and M$ is change password, reset filters, turn on your filter in aggressive mode to make a list of trusted emails and block any new spam coming through. Supposedly there is also a way to have Gmail filter out the spam for you, however the hell that works I don’t know. I got mine down to 2 a day now, and they are the newsletter@cnet ones, which for some reasons are not filtered out because they keep changing them up."

AskReddit,fdm3171,t3_eluch8,1578538614.0,"There's probably tons of worse things out there, but for me the main two ones I've ever been in is back-pain and toothache, at the same time, during a thunderstorm. I see one of the top comments is a tooth abscess which is also something I had during that time. The thing is I had filling in one of my teeth from a previous rootcanal job, which was done beautifully. However after two years it started to hurt like mad, and I couldn't figure out why because I shouldn't be feeling anything. Also an abscess started growing just underneath it. I put my back out a few days earlier which is always lower L spine for me, and it hurts like a mofo and you can't move for days plus need physio.   


I go to the dentist on this bright, warm and sunny day, in a large amount of pain. They said they couldn't figure out what was going on, and had to pull the tooth because of the abscess. I bit the bullet and decided to lose the tooth. The guy had just put the anesthetic in my gums when a massive thunderstorm started to rage outside and in the middle of the procedure the dentistry lost power. Backup generators came in, but it was like a horror film, me lying on the table with flickering lights and loud bangs outside. All the time my back is killing me at the same time.   


In the end, my beautiful root-canal job was revealed to have been a botched one, and the previous dentist had left a split root in my original tooth that just flared up after 2 yrs.   
It was even visible on the previous x-ray and he still missed it. Cost me a lot of money back then as I didn't have insurance at the time. o_0.
So my wallet also got hurt rlly bad"
