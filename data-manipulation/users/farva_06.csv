When we got him home, I tried to move him, and accidentally grabbed him on his wound, and he yelped and snipped, and managed to catch my thumb.  I knew it was an accident, but my dog has never been aggressive before, and it just threw me off so much.  That, and I was still dealing with them having to cut his leg off.
