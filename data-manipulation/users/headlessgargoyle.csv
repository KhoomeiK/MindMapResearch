Even with the shortcomings of that tech though, I do think we could absolutely develop a system with near 0 false positives that would keep people who were waiting on the tracks alive (wouldn't stop a jumper of course), and for all I know it could even be in place today. 

The major issue is accepting that train travel comes with a decent risk of delays at that point, I'm not sure everyone would be okay with that, even if it meant more people staying alive."
programming,femd9td,t1_feko5z5,1579249596.0,"Let's not conflate being passionate about the project or company with being passionate about developing something awesome. 

I don't care what project I'm on, I try to bring my entire A game to it, and try to make it the best it can possibly be. Not for the sake of the project, or the company, or even the people I work with. 100% for me. I take pride in what I contribute to, and I want it to be the best at its job. Anything less is not acceptable to me. 

Don't get me wrong, I know it'll never get there, never be good enough. That's okay. I know there's a lot on any project out of my control, that's okay too. But anything in my control? Should be awesome.  And then I'll leave, find another job or team, and I'll do it again, try my best. It's okay that no project gets there, it's about the growth. That's the passion- getting better.

And I see so, so many people, basically everyone I've ever worked with except for a handful, who don't push, who don't try to do better, who don't try to wrest control from those who shouldn't have it. That's the lack of passion that hurts. That apathetic ""how it's always been done"", that do what your told and don't think for yourself, that guy who hasn't had an opinion on any code that's crossed his path in 10 years, and really takes no pride in his work, but hey, they perform to a standard right?

While I might come off as it I'm not trying to be holier-than-thou or anything, and I apologize if I do, I'm just saying I get it."
todayilearned,fematxf,t1_fem2oa2,1579246417.0,"I was immediately suspicious as well. It was really the use of the word ""accidents"" that screwed with my understanding, since a train hitting a person is still a vehicular accident, but they're explicitly referring to technical or human mistake."
todayilearned,fem4xxq,t1_felsug1,1579239908.0,"You're responding with much less vitriol than others in this thread, and I appreciate that, so thank you, and go you.

That said, surely there are some issues in which assumed consent or required dissent has negative enough personal or familial consequences that _we should not let that be the default_. 

After all, that's really what the whole computer privacy movement is about- an assumed consent/required dissent that it is okay to track your online behavior and data, and many people are very actively fighting to get that flipped.

Now while that has potentially far more negative consequences than organ donation, shouldn't it then follow that if a person or society views organ donation as having these negative personal or familial affects (say, bodily disfigurement at funerals, religious beliefs, etc), that we should instead treat it as an assumed dissent so as to not bring about these negative consequences?

I think that's really the core in the difference of opinion: if you're focused on how organ donation affects the deceased and their family, it makes far more sense to provide an opt in process. If you're focused primarily on how it impacts society then it makes more sense to opt out."
AskReddit,felyc9w,t1_feiwdsl,1579234067.0,"If you're really interested, there's a lot of resources online. You could look up ""basic crochet patterns"". From what I've seen they often include what types of yarn and hooks you'd need.

Those were definitely a more advanced project, but I'm sure you could build up to it!"
AskReddit,fely0qf,t1_fejj63j,1579233816.0,"She used to sell, and like I said I commissioned that as a custom piece, but sadly she doesn't sell anymore.

She does run a [blog](https://thecrochetedbutterfly.wordpress.com) though, with regularly posted patterns, if you or someone you know crochets.

Sorry I couldn't help more!"

Yes, even a basic understanding of germ theory would be fantastic in helping stay alive in the 15th century, but how would you convince people? Galileo famously had much controversy over his knowledge of astronomy, how would your knowledge help do anything but ostracize you as well? How would you convince anyone of the merit of the periodic table without some means of backing up what you know?"
