spinalcordinjuries,ffhr1c7,t1_ffhjnef,1579949359.0,I definitely love stand-up comedy. I am C4 level I have some games I even tried yet but I think if I set my phone up in landscape mode I can give it a go. Angry Birds Plants vs Zombies Fallout vault etcetera I tried Duolingo for languages but I thought it was crap. Before my injury my hobbies were martial arts climbing and triathlons so no luck there lol I also like writing when I was younger so I'm going to try and give that to go using dragon speech software

SuicideWatch,ffha24j,t1_ffh4k7z,1579927520.0,I agree with the dating apps thing I'm a quadriplegic and I never thought I would meet anyone because who would want to date someone in wheelchair who can't do anything. Within a couple weeks I had meant two people so don't dismiss the idea that you won't find anyone because I was lucky enough to. I would recommend finding somewhere to socialise first to help build up the confidence to chat and meet people it will make it more comfortable and you will have less anxiety about waiting for a response or match. I understand what you mean by feeling forever in the context of your life 5 years is a long time when you are 32 like me 5 years becomes nothing. The term things get better I believe things get easier better is very subjective easier means you can deal with the ups and downs but better comes and goes. I wish you nothing but the best I hope you can figure out your situation. You can always message me if you liked
cats,ff8pnkr,t3_es10yt,1579690661.0,Have you tried learning signalling and using other techniques to communicate with the cat I have seen some videos on Reddit where people have cool ways of communicating with their deaf cat
SuicideWatch,ff8pkcu,t3_es07op,1579690530.0,I know a few people who have done these things and end up worse and have feelings of suicide so to me it just seems pointless. The laws for assisted stuff needs to be universal of course it needs to be regulated but surely if someone decides their time is up they should be allowed to make that decision especially if they are right mind. It would be hard to create the criteria though as I see people who aren't disabled and wonder why they would be depressed and want to die. I would give everything to be able bodied but I've never had thoughts of death until I sustained my injury
SuicideWatch,ff5qrfv,t3_ers8ll,1579606478.0,May I ask how old you are? I recently broke my neck and I am completely paralysed at 32 I'm definitely trapped physically and mentally but I wonder what makes you feel trapped
SuicideWatch,ff5qlg3,t1_ff3n31f,1579606260.0,"You still can help people I recently suffered a serious spinal injury with the help of nurses and support carers I'm able to have some resemblance of life
This is just one example of how you can help someone I've met a lot of people who are broken that find helping people like me give them a purpose
There is so much out there you can do"

SuicideWatch,fexlyha,t1_fewplbh,1579433164.0,That is a good question I recently suffered a neck break and I'm completely paralyzed the way they talk about this injury it makes you wonder why anyone continues but there are people that have so it makes me wonder if time really does help and the only way to know is to give it time which is probably the worst considering there is no way to truly know

spinalcordinjuries,fe5kfzr,t3_enrxmh,1578870547.0,Hey I'm a male 9 months Post injury I noticed I could attain erections after my indwelling catheter was removed and replace with a suprapubic catheter. So far I can only feel inside my urethra which doesn't do much for me but give me a sense of that area. I've yet been able to orgasm as it goes down quite often but I've discovered that kissing and hugging and just being intimate has been massive for me. I think if you find the right partner you can connect with emotionally and physically orgasms aren't all that important.

spinalcordinjuries,fdpnzhi,t3_emffcl,1578634187.0,All I can say is while the situation can look bleak just no doctors still can't determine how much function can come back I have seen guys who are vegetables and eventually get finger movement and start to walk in a frame things are very possible you just need to keep a strong mindset because even if things don't come back what is the point in having a negative attitude anyway
spinalcordinjuries,fddfz4a,t3_eknfqb,1578310569.0,Broke my neck 9 months ago separated from my wife 3 months ago I jumped on Tinder and now I have a girlfriend I am quadriplegic if I can do it anyone can. You have no idea how much physical insecurities I have as well as mental but you have to try because someone will always care. The only thing holding you back is yourself. Happy to talk with you if you'd like all the best.
