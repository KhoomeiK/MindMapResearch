Not really. For quite some time cEDH has also lobbied heavily for other cards to be banned, [[Ad Nauseum]] in particular (which as an occasional cEDH player myself I understand banning AdNaus, but only for cEDH). 

Another example that has come up recently (see the AMA w/Sheldon last year), is some in the cEDH community wanting to eliminate color identify from Commander. Was really surprised to see that argument get support over at cEDH as color identity is what makes EDH so unique and flavorful.

EDH is the only major format in MTG that governs/makes banned lists based off of game enjoyment and not competitiveness. Every other format is regulated for the sake of the competitive community. Except this one, and I feel that is what adds to EDH's longevity; people aren't burned out by the Spikeyness and financial requirements like in other formats. The game is very much in a ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" type situation, and I think alot of it has to do with the fact the game is played and governed by casual play. 

I'm not a fan of making bans on cards that are otherwise benign in casual for the sake of cEDH. It's a precedent I don't want to see set....And again, cEDH just needs their own committee and banlists."
