lawschooladmissions,ffjgcxc,t1_ffjfymw,1579997667.0,"It's one of the classic rugby memes - Vahaamahina didn't know he was the captain for a test match, which was important because that is the only player who can talk to the ref. It's typically adapted to point out someone who has clearly made a mistake in their life/game/season etc. Like Sarries getting relegated for their wage bill issues."
soccer,ffj37gc,t1_ffix5y9,1579989242.0,I played college football - I'd say it's an entirely different discipline and as such I'm in different modes when I'm watching either sport. I'm more analytical watching American football - I'm more of a fan watching footy. I'm most a fan when I'm watching rugby because it's not something I grew up with.

todayilearned,fejqylt,t1_fejpjgu,1579183640.0,"Urban dictionary is not what you should be using. And whataboutism is literally a logical fallacy that was created to attack leftist arguments without engaging with them in particular regards to the Soviet Union. Literally the etymology and history of words is vital to understand what they mean, why they mean that, and how they were and are used."
todayilearned,fejkplp,t1_fej10qj,1579178151.0,So cool that you know that
todayilearned,fejknki,t1_fejfu24,1579178093.0,"Well urban dictionary is certainly the source you should always use... Whataboutism became popular both as a defense of ussr policy (by distraction) and then a smear to be used against someone who was pointing out particular similar policies etc. Two examples of historical writings that could be labelled whataboutism wrongly would be 'Cultivating the Masses"" and Paul Josephson's writings on similarities in 1930s American and Soviet environmental policy.
Nuance applies because you brought up whataboutism, which was often used by a spur by reactionaries to dispel the opinions and analysis of issues by historians operating under some form of historical materialism when analyzing history, preventing them from pointing out the nuanced discussions they wanted to have. 

Also don't assume gender, it's the same as the American assumption."
todayilearned,feiqnji,t1_feimuf6,1579144781.0,"Don't confuse nuance, or pointing out an obvious hypocrisy for whataboutism... Also whataboutism is ... Just a neoliberal way of saying neoliberalism is inherently right and anyone who says otherwise is a card carrying communist. While yes, when used to distract one issue in an argument with a superficially similar but unrelated issue it is a fallacy, but when it's used to address a nuanced issue, or point something out that might not be apparent, then it's not really a fallacy, or whataboutism. Just because it's inconvenient to you does not make it a fallacy.
In this case I think it would have been a fair point to make that after what was in ways irresponsible, a government adapted policy to prevent future instances of said unwanted outcomes - and that the United States frequently does nothing to alter irresponsible policies that result in undesirable outcomes. While you aren't American it loses all of it's value, but i believe it is a frequent assumption on Reddit that many participants are American.

Edit: oh yeah forgot to say - tons of us States don't allow for anonymous lottery winners ... Which again is something you described as common sense. So if this guy had assumed you were an American - then the stones and glass houses argument works pretty clearly"
