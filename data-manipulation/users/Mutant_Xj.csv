educationalgifs,ff4wo1e,t1_ff2w9fi,1579574237.0,Interesting.  It looks like it would not be able to cut harder materials though and I'm curious as to how clean the cut it.
educationalgifs,ff2uvsu,t1_ff2shil,1579525094.0,In this model there is nothing supporting the wankel mechanism. It just sits inside the square frame.
educationalgifs,ff2utlh,t1_ff2h766,1579525026.0,But in this model there is nothing supporting the wankel mechanism. The whole thing sits inside an open frame.
educationalgifs,ff2unl9,t1_ff2gxhy,1579524844.0,The small point would be moving sideways in a square pattern as it's trying to cut into the material. Think of trying to drill a hole using a standard electric drill but drawing a square pattern with the drill bit as you're trying to cut. It'll probably want to snap if it catches any resistance.
educationalgifs,ff2ud7m,t1_ff2886x,1579524518.0,If cutting wood it looks like it would have horrible tearout.
educationalgifs,ff2uaal,t1_ff2kcmb,1579524426.0,The drill bit that is rotating and cutting is not supported by anything. It sits inside the square frame and is driven by two universal joints. A standard drill bit is a solid shaft. This thing introduces several hinges into it so now it's no longer rigid.

A mortise machine is a totally different approach and actually works."

ZeldaOoT,felss2e,t3_epl6qp,1579230036.0,"I was fucking PISSED!!! My first playthrough was a few years ago on the 3ds version. My oldest daughter was maybe ten at the time, became fascinated with Zelda lure and read all the info online she could about it before she started playing the games. Well while her, her sister and I were watching a cut scene with Sheik, she burst out,""Oh! That's actually Princess Zelda!"" I think this was right when I first became Adult Link so it was the first time seeing Sheik. I was so mad at her because she ruined the storyline for me. It was so hard to explain to her why that was a bad thing for her to do and that she shouldn't spoil story's for other people."
PrimitiveTechnology,fece8gd,t3_eocaka,1578971820.0,Gigging! The river I live right next to used to have a large eel population back in the day. Many locals used to go eel fishing all the time. We find gigs of all types in the local antiques stores. I also came across a newspaper at my wife's grandmother's house from the early 1900s and there was a small article about a family that fell through the ice and drown while they were out eel fishing. It wasn't uncommon for drownings to happen in the valley from falling through the ice.

Pennsylvania,fcn19an,t1_fcm7991,1577800350.0,Ghetto in the Susquehanna valley tends to refer to city/urban trash or poor piss poor quality of something. More appropriate for us rural folk would be trailer park for rural trash or redneck engineering for poor quality of something. Although with the rise of Hip Hop culture in the 90s and the youth of the time embracing it as much as they have Ghetto is a popular choice for those in the under 40 crowd.

Pennsylvania,fcbybz4,t3_egu0yw,1577592331.0,"This hospital over the years has made a bad reputation for itself for trying to over charge its patients, treating them poorly, or threatening them for non payment. They fucked me over personally and I have several family members and former coworkers who have similar experiences with the hospital. Unfortunately the company that had purchased the hospital did nothing to revamp its image to the locals. Most of us would rather drive to Shamokin Geisinger, Danville Geisinger, or Evangelical in Lewisburg for much better service."
