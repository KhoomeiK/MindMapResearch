offmychest,ff6inb5,t3_erq8k1,1579628011.0,Good on ya! I have found my healing is amplified when I do what I can to help others.
offmychest,ff6ih51,t3_eru1na,1579627906.0,"It's so strange how we (especially women) are conditioned not to ""cause a fuss"" and when we get angry or whatever, we condemn ourselves for losing control."
offmychest,ff4qcs5,t1_ff408ye,1579569906.0,"What I have learned is that the only one who can give you closure, is you. You'll never get that relief from the person who hurt you. They oftentimes don't see it as an issue, which is a hard blow. Once you realize that you can begin to forgive yourself and move on."
offmychest,ff4q86l,t3_erg32o,1579569818.0,"Good for you OP. Being able to reach out like this at any instant through social media, etc., is honestly so dangerous. Have had issues with it myself. Hope you can move on from this soon."
offmychest,ff1r0my,t1_ff1qkti,1579484276.0,"It seems they are woefully under-funded/staffed across the board. I went to mine in a bad state of anxiety/depression and I was turned away. If you find your symptoms are pervasive, have you considered taking a medication? It's not a cure-all, but I find mine helps enormously."
offmychest,ff1pf6f,t3_er5mqb,1579483235.0,"Please don't think you are selfish for feeling anxious/depressed despite your looks, social privilege, etc. You're not weak for being sick, it's not entirely something you can control (outside of therapy, medication). Can you speak to a school counsellor about some therapy options?"
AskReddit,ff1oqx6,t3_er2m1h,1579482818.0,Meal-prepping for the week!
offmychest,ff1ofpn,t3_er5ksk,1579482626.0,"You have plenty of time, there's no need to rush things."
SkincareAddiction,feie2qw,t1_fec55f8,1579136352.0,I should try using every other day. I noticed after a break and coming back to it my face looked nice the day after I applied it... I'll have to start writing down this routine!!
SkincareAddiction,feidslo,t1_fedzkif,1579136164.0,"I think the Niacinamide + Zinc is breaking me out as well! I have noticed closed comedones at the sides of my nose which is not normal for my skin. Bummer, I really wanted to like this stuff. I think it is just a bit too heavy/occlusive for my skin."
