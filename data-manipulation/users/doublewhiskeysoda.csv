Stalin must not have been a fascist after all. I know that because you said, “he wasn’t a fascist.” Man, that really opened my eyes! I hadn’t thought about it like that before!

Yes, having some (perceived) benefits from the present system will reduce the likelihood of popular support for a revolution. That has been a concern of revolutionaries for centuries - whether to hasten the revolution by opposing these little compromises from those in power or to acknowledge them so as to encourage some immediate relief. 

It’s also a conscious tactic by the ruling class to turn everyone into investors. That’s how they see the world - in terms of private ownership and employer-employee relations and stakeholders. If you’re an investor, you’re more likely to see yourself as a temporarily embarrassed millionaire instead of a member of an exploited laboring class. 

Another thing many revolutionaries have advocated for over the years is building a skeleton for the future society within the shell of the current one. I’d like to think if we can get people to see themselves as a community, working together to help everyone’s lives improve, then we have a better base to build on in terms of organizing a large-scale resistance"
COMPLETEANARCHY,fgfmg5n,t3_ey6wd3,1580742608.0,"Clearly, the kind of revolution most of us in this sub are aiming toward - broad-based, voluntary, non-hierarchical, etc. - isn’t going to happen in the very near future. 

In order for it to happen at all, folks need to value community. They need to see how and why working together makes everyone’s lives better.

Building the revolution means building a sense of community - respect for your neighbors and coworkers, treating yourself and others with dignity - and Bernie’s the one advocating for those things. 

I want to see a government where Bernie’s the president we need to overthrow."

oldschoolcreepy,fgeotta,t1_fgeef3y,1580705125.0,"> Show me a communist society that hasn't become authoritarian in nature

Firstly, a communist society is threatening to every hierarchical social system in the world. So whether you’re the USSR or the US or whoever, you like your people to shut up and do as they’re told. The existence of a “real communist” society is a sign to folks everywhere that there’s an alternative to shutting up and doing as your told. That’s why any society that’s organized along communist ideals is crushed - because every other power structure in the world wants it to die. 

So when these things pop up now and then, they’re pretty quickly wiped out. 

That being said, [there are lots of communities - large and small - that have been organized in a non-hierarchical, “this is real communism” way](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anarchist_communities#Mass_societies)

To answer your question about ones of a certain size that didn’t devolve into pure authoritarianism, I’ll toss off a few suggestions 
 
* [Catalonia in the mid to late 1930s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia)

* [Modern-day Rojava](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojava) 

* [The Paris Commune of 1871](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune)

Look, I understand that the words and terms associated with “real communism” get abused a lot, but you should know that it’s a viable alternative to the top-down power systems we have now. The problems those types of bottom-up power structures face are certainly there and need to be addressed - but people within those systems need time to sort those out together. Instead, they (typically) end up spending their time simply fighting for the right to exist. 

This is where you insert the Eric Andre shooting Hannibal Burress meme about how dominant systems destroy non-dominant systems and then say “Hey, communism doesn’t work.”"

wholesomememes,fg4faz4,t1_fg4bwlt,1580502348.0,"Ok, but if people developed a well-considered political and economic system that met these standards - I mean, not allowing any single person to have enough power to abuse or to be in a position where their abuses wouldn’t be immediately noticed, would it be worthwhile trying it out? I think so. 

As for the point you made about communism, I’ve never known a communist government to be allowed to exist for more than a few months. The Paris Commune of 1872 fell within three months. The liberated areas of Catalonia (during the Spanish Civil War) were only independently held for like 8 or 9 months. The Free Territory liberated by Nestor Makhno’s White Army (during the Russian Civil War) was never even allowed to coalesce into a functioning thing. And the biggest one - the February revolution of 1917 in Russia - was stamped out by the October revolution in 1917. 

Every one of those opportunities was quashed by violent state action. So it’s a little disingenuous to say that it’d never work - it hasn’t had a chance. * insert Eric Andre shooting Hannibal Burress meme here *

Maybe we should try an actual system like that, some version of communism that is voluntary and non-hierarchical

I imagine such a system would need to be organized in some kind of bottom-up approach instead of a top-down style. That’d allow for the structural changes I mentioned in my comment above. Is there a social system like that - non-hierarchical and voluntary?

EDIT: I guess you’d still have to get it past the current politicians, but if they won’t support it, is it worth the energy to pursue a better system?"

wholesomememes,fg41uff,t1_fg3zfm3,1580494397.0,"So you think we should make some structural changes, then, huh? Ok, good thinking. 

How do we develop a system that will incentivize politicians to respond to the will of the citizens and the needs of the community more effectively? 

I’d say term limits, the power to recall elected officials instantly, and severely restricting (and maybe outlawing) lobbyists might be part of the solution. 

Agree? Disagree? Any suggestions or oversights? Any additions? 

And also, is there a public figure advocating for these ideas already? If not, how do we get one (or some) to support this stuff? If we can’t get anyone to support it, then what?"
wholesomememes,fg40ovu,t1_fg3y7gi,1580493701.0,"Money is not the only motivator in the world and it’s not even a particularly effective one. 

Not to mention that the reason American schools aren’t functioning well is because they’re not funded well. Capitalism will only fund them to the extent they make money, and once that initial “gold rush” period is over, it’ll be like any other service - some restaurants are fast-food and cheap; others are Michelin starred and expensive. Education is a social good, and shouldn’t be subject to the whims of a market. It’s one of those things where a rising tide raises all boats. 

If you’re interested in making schools effective and not destroyed by the capitalists’ profit motive, then there will have to be a broad solution. For starters, school shouldn’t be compulsory, shouldn’t be organized by age group, and they shouldn’t have a strict regimented 8am-3pm schedule. While we’re at it, they shouldn’t be hierarchical systems either - students should have say in what and how and with whom they learn. The country should quadruple its investment in schools at least. Teaching should be a difficult job to get in the same vein as other lines of work - like law and medicine - where you train for that specific career. 

Nope. Turning schools into versions of department stores (I can’t afford to send my kid to Saks Fifth Avenue, so I guess I’ll settle for TJ Maxx) isn’t going to do anything but make the whole thing worse for the country. It should be nationalized and treated like it’s the country’s lifeline - because it is.

wholesomememes,fg3xoh4,t1_fg3par3,1580491875.0,"No way! Privatizing it just makes education a for-profit institution. Then, all the schools will be making decisions about what’s best for their bottom lines - not what’s best for their students and parents.
