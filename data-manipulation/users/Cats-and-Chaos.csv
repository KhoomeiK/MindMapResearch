Aquariums,ffafpi4,t1_ffa9wo6,1579734670.0,"So the fish line anchors the islands? Nice! Are the plants live and if so what kind?
How does boiling help the pumice sink and can larger pieces than that work? 

Anyway, such a cool concept!"

He sounds incredibly toxic and while you may â€œlove himâ€ or doesnâ€™t sound as though heâ€™s capable of loving you."
relationship_advice,ff9u2ca,t3_esgfzl,1579721309.0,She doesnâ€™t even respect you enough to tell you the truth. It will be hard at first but youâ€™ll be better off without her.

relationship_advice,ff5vc96,t3_errja4,1579611514.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry this has happened to you, OP. If you intend to meet and talk to him Iâ€™d suggest you do it in a public space such as a coffee shop. Iâ€™d also consider having somewhere to go and decompress afterwards such a trusted friends house.
Also remember only HE can make the necessary changes to address this problem. That means he first needs to acknowledge and accept that his behaviour towards you has been abusive. He then needs to make active steps to change and be better. 
Also, his whole â€˜if you gave me sex more I wouldnâ€™t have effectively raped youâ€™ rhetoric is abhorrent."

relationship_advice,feylno6,t3_eqtvo8,1579447258.0,"As others have stated youâ€™re a mandatory reporter and have a duty of care towards the student. As the â€˜whistleblowerâ€™ there may be unfortunate repercussions for you but that does not trump the fact you are obligated to report this and should do so as soon as possible. 
This may sound harsh but you need to put all thoughts of your friendship with â€˜Henryâ€™ aside. Itâ€™s a really horrible situation for you but you have no choice but to put personal feelings aside.
I agree with those who have advised you contact your union rep. Also be sure to document everything. Iâ€™d suggest you ensure all communication regarding this matter is done in written form where possible and that you keep records of everything that is said. If meetings are to occur in person then ask that your union rep accompanies you and that a record of what is discussed is taken if the meeting itself canâ€™t be recorded."

Aquariums,feehla5,t1_fed1fkq,1579033907.0,Iâ€™m not sure but I think the smaller species (like this guy) are fairly common. Could always ask your LFS if theyâ€™d consider adding them to their next order?
