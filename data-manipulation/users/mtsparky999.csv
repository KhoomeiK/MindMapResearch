cat,ffavhk4,t3_esf4il,1579745441.0,So cute! Our cat is also sporting the same name.
dogpictures,ffasmul,t3_esiyfu,1579743553.0,Frida is absolutely adorable.
AskReddit,femn512,t1_fekns3t,1579263335.0,"While hearing the difference between pets walking is easy, but it's the same when my kids were little. Wife and I would be in the bedroom with the door shut, and we could tell which child was doing what. Our son moved like a ghost, had to really listen to hear him move. Our daughter... she sounded like big foot, thunking all over the place."
dogs,fejfnlo,t3_ep5ems,1579171927.0,"LMAO, our GSD/Golden retriever mix, Dolly, is obsessed with the dog park about 3/4 of a mile away. She's gotten off her leash outside three times. The first time she ended up being picked up by the police from the dog park and taken to the pound. Second time we found her running up and down the outside fence of the dog park barking at the other dogs inside the park. Third time I rolled up to the park, seeing a police car parked there. Got out and the police officer rolled down her window and asked if she had my dog. Since Dolly saw me and was going nuts in the back. 

She's a wonderful dog otherwise, very loving and mothering. Wouldn't trade her for anything."

AskReddit,fcaf6xo,t3_egr0oo,1577568198.0,"Well, as parents we've had a couple of times there were walk in's, will never forget being on top and inside the wife, looking into her eyes in that post orgasmic bliss, and have someone tickle the bottom of the foot. But my most memorable was wife and I going at it, really into it, not making much noise, but just really enjoying the act. There's a knock at the door, hear 16 year old daughter ask something, wife yells out a response then we hear the 16 year old nearly vomit out ""oh God"" when she realized what she had interrupted. Wife and I laughed and continued. 

I'll tell you, as parents, you get used to resuming after small interruptions fairly quickly."

dogs,fc6ppa7,t3_egftxr,1577486351.0,What an absolute mutt! She's adorable! Is she as intelligent as most mutts are?
AskReddit,fc3whhh,t3_efpp1t,1577400412.0,"Wow, I've actually got one for this. Many years ago, I worked in security. Was at an apartment complex with gated access. Basically, I sat in a guard shack, watched TV or read books as this was before smartphones. Press a button to raise and lower the gate based on stickers on the cars, or sign people in and out if they didn't have the stickers.

One night about 2-3 am, car comes up, the female driver is insanely hot, and wearing not a stitch. It took me a moment to find the button to raise the gate. I definitely got an eyeful."

Had a couple of months where I would wait until bedtime and make sure I had a full bladder. My parents never mentioned it, and I don't remember it ever really stinking. Either way, kids are weird."
