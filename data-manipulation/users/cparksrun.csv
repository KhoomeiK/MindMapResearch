I don't know enough to know if it's negatively impacting my playthrough, but the simplicity and elegance with which gates just open without a loading screen is so nice and seamless. I've been wondering why it wasn't a function of the vanilla game."

But it's been getting more and more expensive. Last year, I ended up paying over $100 out of my return just to file with them. So I might start looking at other options. Or squint really hard to try and find the free option."

At first I was wondering why a couple couldn't inseminate with the husband's sperm. But then I was wondering what good inseminating a man would do.

That perfectly sums up how I feel about a LTR that ended about a year ago. Thank you for putting it that way. This song already reminded me of that relationship, but now even more so.  


Particularly ""Hey baby: where were you back there when I needed your help? I thought that if I stuck my neck out, I'd get you out of your shell.""  


I was constantly acting like a dork, trying to get her to loosen up and she'd just react by closing up even more and getting embarrassed by my silly antics."
TheNational,fdlfw97,t1_fdihf8k,1578523147.0,My favorite song from SWB. And they released the music video on my birthday! And I kinda look like the chubby bearded dude dancing throughout! It's like they were throwing a party just for me.

videos,fczq2bf,t1_fcznbcd,1578106609.0,"Well put. But maybe there are steps we as a society can take to break free of the cycle. Because chicken, egg, whatever. The truth is that war makes some people extremely wealthy and many of those people are very close with our ""representatives"" and law makers. 

So the sooner we can reduce the influence of money in our politics, the less likely I believe we'll see things like this.

Also, it seems pretty obvious that this is a diversion tactic. Clinton did it during his impeachment, and now Trump is picking a fight to distract from his own legal issues. So maybe something can be done to remove that sort of power from any president going forward.

The point is, SOMETHING needs to change. Because ""people gonna people"" is going to result in lots more pointless deaths."
