Still plenty of wastes. But the PIN system is beautiful. It's not as smooth as I'd like, but it is much better than the stupid signature pad and much, much faster. Unfortunately, the email system for sending the initial PIN is dodgy as crap and has issues with Gmail the most (which is the most common email out there). You can do all the PIN stuff through Chrome!

But of course, AFRISS developers didn't enable the PIN in all the forms yet, so some still still require the signature pad (which I just have them usually wet sign and upload them)."

AirForce,feobnq8,t1_femwx3l,1579297782.0,"The official answer is asthma and/or inhaler usage after your 13th birthday is disqualifying and will require a waiver from the surgeon general.

If it's disclosed on the medical form and it occurred after your 13th birthday, it will require all medical documents regarding the the asthma or inhaler and likely the last 3-5 years of pharmacy records. If it's long enough ago that the records aren't available anymore, your parents would need to provide a narrative on everything about it.

If it's disclosed on the medical form and it occurred before your 13th birthday, they will require all medical records from the age of 13 until present to make sure you don't have any record of asthma after your 13th birthday.

Depending on the recruiter (and possibly depending on how long they've been in), they might recommend putting anything and everything on the form to stay truthful, others will suggest you leave anything out that can be potentially disqualifying, assuming it's not an issue now. It really depends on who you talk to.

If you disclose it to some recruiters, they may not be willing to work with you because of all the extra work involved (if the area has a lot of people interested and the recruiter isn't hurting for people). Others may tell you to just shut up about it so you don't disqualify yourself. And others will have you document it and go through whatever requirements needed for the condition.

If it is disclosed and medical records are provided, those medical records may include additional issues that will need to be documented and might require more records and could be additional items that can disqualify you.

Officially, you are signing a document stating that whatever on there is truthful. As long as you are ok with everything that is on that form, then sign it, and make sure nothing new is brought up during your medical exam."

There's no way to know what jobs you're qualified for until the medical exam is completed, but there are some things we can use to determine an applicant's ability to book a job. If you lack color vision, depth perception, driver's license, or are under a certain height, we know some jobs won't be available.

Otherwise, sometimes we, as recruiters, are as surprised as applicants are when the medical exam happens and the results knock applicants out of the running for jobs we were expecting.

If you haven't done your medical exam and the recruiter knows you aren't qualified for it, they should've never scheduled you for the DLAB."
Piracy,fenxgoa,t1_fen0yvd,1579292237.0,"To better explain it, 4k is related to the resolution of the video or the number of pixels horizontally and vertically. 4k can also be called 2160p or Ultra HD/UHD.

4k = 3840x2160
1440p = 2560x1440
1080p = 1920x1080

4k is double the resolution of 1080p, meaning it has double the rows and columns of pixels. If you multiple them together to find out just how many pixels are on the screen, it ends up being 4x the amount of 1080p (~2M vs ~8M pixels)

If your monitor is limited to 1920x1080 resolution, it can't physically display more pixels than it has. But streaming services will just stream a lower quality version, so instead of them streaming a 4k video, they'll just stream a 1080p version."

You'd want to lower the lights to leave you with about the same light distance on the road.

Washington state's regulations state that low beams should cover 150ft in front of you and shouldn't be able to blind oncoming traffic:

I wouldn't call into the low income and live in SL county, so I think I'd be getting $2800 towards it, but if it's going to cost me about that much to replace it, I doubt it would be worth it.
