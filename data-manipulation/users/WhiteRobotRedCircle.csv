That part when she said “Can somebody call the cops please?” She didn’t know how to just watch the two idiots fight for a bit. Plus everyone got their phones out. “Don’t get involved she attacked her first” is grounds for not wanting anyone to interrupt her precious drama? What the fuck?

I do think trump is a dickhead and is ruining the reputation of the American government and giving international credibility and power to Moscow and Putin through his own inability to handle international politics.
