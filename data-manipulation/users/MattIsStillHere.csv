She rode my trail bike which was better than hers. I rode my high-end downhill oriented bike because it's the only other bike I had. While looking at the trail map a guy with a spandex and brand logo laden group heckled me about whether I expected to ""use all that travel bro.. hehehe..."""

At my last employer I was at this point, informed them I was leaving instead of just doing so, I knew they were extremely busy and depended on me at this time, got a nice increase but I told them that was only temporary, that I needed more opportunity. Oh yeah? they asked. Got in WAYYY over my head! Your new salary is $100k now go figure out how to do business on another continent. Like, what??? I don't know anything about business at this level!

All of their husbands are overweight, boring, no hobbies, hen-pecked, and seemingly resigned to their fate. My wife is too nice to say this or tell them how we have good sex multiple time per week while the ladies complain about their men's lack of sex drive.

Chennai, India. Where does it go? Shrug. Up and out I guess. Anyhow, this wasn't some arrogant prick, rather, a poor housewife in an area with no trash collection despite being in a big city. It's both all she knows and her only option. The neighborhoods just behind this were trashed. The beach community was clean, because they use the ocean.

Those often hurt until the pressure is relieved, sometimes by hot needle or with a tiny drill. As a laser technician I used a laser to pop a hole in my fingernail to relieve the pressure. It  was under a camera at 50x. It looked like Mt Vesuvius erupting! Instant relief too. FYI, I found the right power setting on a nail clipping before the procedure. Good times."

Didn't even notice until a few days later. I still see spots that resemble individual laser spot welds in a little line, mostly only when I look at a clear blue sky or other light homogeneous background. The spots are just off center so I cannot actually ""look"" straight at them but every time I notice them my eyes automatically try to track them. Eye moves spots move... maddening but better then dead center in my vision."

I can't help but think of that on the rare occasion that I see him and I'm quite sure he's also thinking of the same moment judging by the half grin half guilty look on his face.

As an adult/parent with depression, I see all these people coming together for your dad and realize I don't have any community around me at all that will do this. Did he know that so many people cared about him? Did they come out of the woodwork only after he passed? I think that's something that often goes through peoples' heads when contemplating or struggling with suicidal thoughts. Would anyone care? Will anyone even notice I'm gone?
