news,ff4n3t5,t1_ff42980,1579567628.0,"Now this is something that really gets me about this current environment. There is no room for disagreement. If you are (X) party then you must agree with EVERYTHING they do. If you are friends with (X) person then you must agree with everything they believe. So many people now have taken an all or nothing view. 

One of the best friends I ever had was a diehard liberal. He and I could sit down with a shitload of beer and discuss anything and never once did either of us raise our voice. We could talk for hours. On some things, he had some great points. On other things, he admitted I had some great points. Most importantly, we never judged each other. 

Nowadays, you're judged before you even speak. People get drug through the mud for things they did or said years, even decades, ago. Most likely, that person was very different then. Peoples views tend to change over time. Ask just about any adult about the shit they believed as a teenager and watch them cringe. 

Ask yourself this: If my parties belief changes, does mine? The answer might tell you a lot about yourself."

In times of emergency, you gotta put all that shit aside. No ones life is worth a political point. We can argue all we want AFTER everyone is safe and provided for."

PublicFreakout,ff3lcq7,t1_ff3f1am,1579543502.0,My research: Comcast customer for 15 years.
PublicFreakout,ff20bdr,t1_ff1oxt1,1579490410.0,There is a reason that Comcast is continuously voted the most hated company in the US. It's because they are always coming up with new ways to fleece and fuck their customers.
The_Congress,ff15fei,t1_ff12lvi,1579475412.0,"He's never going to get one. The Dems will simply pretend that all that matters is he was impeached, which itself is just another word for indicted or accused."

videos,fezd08d,t1_fezaxu9,1579456049.0,"FEMA delivered the aid. For whatever reason, the local government did not distribute it to the point of having a security perimeter to prevent people from finding it. The governor just fired the emergency director for that. Remember all the politicians, from the governor on down, crying on TV about how the feds weren't sending aid? They just got caught with their pants down lying about it."

gaming,fevx3d2,t1_fevweio,1579402573.0,Agreed. Gaming went mainstream a long time ago.

WorldofTanks,fd4jbhw,t3_ejy6mn,1578168008.0,I've been having to play arty to get these damn missions done. I tapped an Obj 703 (the double barrel thing) for 977 last night. I felt so damn dirty.

He has severe anger issues. Replacing that chair does not make him face the consequences of him destroying it. I play games online and I get pissed off at things that happen.

Social media is proven to be at least slightly detrimental to mental health due to how it portrays ""reality"". In today's climate, bullying and attacking others for their views or beliefs is the norm. To much bullshit, too much drama, not enough compassion and tolerance."

You really never gave him a chance. You set him up with someone who set out to seduce him with insider knowledge of his likes and dislikes. 

How would you like if someone did that to you? Constantly punishing you for the sins of others. Constantly comparing you to the ghosts in their closet."
