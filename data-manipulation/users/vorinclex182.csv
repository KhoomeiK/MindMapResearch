IdiotsInCars,ff9khyv,t1_ff9jx20,1579714923.0,But if someone were to try and check the information how far do you get with “my country” as opposed to “in Spain”? Does it matter if they currently live there as long as they are knowledgeable on the laws? How does providing more information make your claim less credible? It actually does the opposite. It provides a base for somebody to be able to check for themselves instead of just trusting someone on the internet. You can easily say “in my country we do xyz” and no one would be able to disprove or verify.
