IdiotsInCars,ffns21l,t1_ffnr9ju,1580070009.0,"Not an idiot. No reason to not have them. 

It's because liberals have no idea what the fuck they regulated. You can't have wheel spacers bigger than 2"". This is because morons will just space out the studs and attach a wheel with no threads. 

You can get wheel spacers that thread on and have their own studs. Zero safety issue.

Yet here we are and they blanket restrict them.

You also need retractable seat belts. I have 4 point harnesses. Good enough for NHRA not good enough for DoT.

Here we have you doing the same thing they did. You are ignorant to what is going on and willing to restrict something."
IdiotsInCars,ffnqwri,t1_ffnnsib,1580069550.0,Oof that's rough. No reason I shouldn't be able to have wheel spacers. My vehicle is no less safe. Like I said the rules are absurd and I will not follow them.
IdiotsInCars,ffnjinq,t1_ffnj0dm,1580066775.0,"Doesn't matter anyway. You just avoid the rules.

They were made by liberals who have no idea what the shit they are talking about."
IdiotsInCars,ffndnnm,t1_ffncqbn,1580064595.0,"Not at all. The rules are absurd. You can't have line locks. No wheel spacers. You need a parking brake and it can't be a transfer case brake. Your wheels can't go past your fenders. You can't have any open holes in the floor. I could go on.

It's fucking silly."
