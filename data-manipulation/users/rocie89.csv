marriageadvice,ffdm8tr,t1_ffd77y9,1579823877.0,That's a really great question? You answer that and you'll have your answer.
AskWomen,ffcn9yn,t3_erdikl,1579803075.0,Sexual abuse.  I'm not exactly sure what happened.  Something clicked in my head. It was just my mother and two brothers. I knew that if I said anything she would have literally killed this person and I knew that would mean she'd go to jail. Eight year old me ofcourse didn't want that. That was the moment I realized the world isn't always nice so I spent a lot of time becoming more rational rather then letting emotions lead the way.  It's worked out pretty well.
DeadBedrooms,ffbtrv0,t3_eslkk7,1579782457.0,I'm so sorry man. People like her are just selfish. How did she think you were gonna react to finding out you had been tricked into a marriage where she had no intention on actually trying to make you happy too.
JUSTNOMIL,ff7p3k6,t3_erza38,1579654909.0,I'm sorry about your lost. Tou two seriously need to step away from that woman. Its one thing to not care about you but to not even feel at least a little sad that your own child is suffering is just too much. She can just go choke on it.
AmItheAsshole,ff63df6,t3_erskit,1579618119.0,NTA is your property to do as you wish and not your responsibility to take care of their kids

marriageadvice,feowiw4,t3_eq8fph,1579306925.0,2-3 days a week when you have 2 very small children at home is excessive.  I have no kids and rarely go out.

AskReddit,fegoawo,t3_eoyn3a,1579098609.0,A comforting hug.
marriageadvice,fdq8qs1,t3_emn3cn,1578659466.0,Because sighing those papers aren't important.  At the end of the day I'd rather be happy then married.  If you love your significant other then sighing that piece f paper isn't going to change anything.  To me the commitment to the partnership is more important than letting the whole world know. At the end of the day it's your relationship not the while worlds.

AmItheAsshole,fdhsvmf,t3_eld14g,1578429539.0,NTA if it's a public park she can't expect you to just go away cause she didn't properly socialized her dogs. That's not your fault.
AmItheAsshole,fdh25yy,t3_elawpx,1578413758.0,NTA you're sister is an asshole and she's raising an asshole.  What kind of person allows their kids to behave like this. Thinking that dumb things like best dressed are real accomplishments and letting them think it's ok to embarrass their family. I just dont understand parents like her.
