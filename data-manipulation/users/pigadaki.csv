You have seen the effects it can have and will treat any future child you may or may not choose to have with extra care as a result. My mother is a lot like yours and I am a kind, loving parent. In a way, it's like having a useful blueprint of what not to do. I'm not going to tell you that it's easy to raise a child without the help of supportive grandparents, and it's even harder when the grandparent is emotionally abusive, but it's healing to experience that loving parent-child relationship, and give your baby everything you never had. 

Please do not feel that you ever need to give anyone a reason for not wanting kids. But don't talk yourself out of it just because you think you won't be good enough."

AmItheAsshole,fdglihu,t3_el2ls9,1578401356.0,"NTA. I feel that when you become a mother, you lose your previous identity and gain a new one. It can take time to adjust to this, and taking care of your appearance can help enormously. Not to mention the fact that you are now probably getting dressed up to go out less, spending less time on your appearance and focusing on the baby for like 90% of your waking hours. It's perfectly reasonable to want some time to focus on yourself. When my baby was tiny, I remember fantasising about getting a massage or having someone brush my hair. The first haircut I went for felt like pure luxury. Treat yourself, queen!

Edit: please consider trying a few less intrusive treatments before you decide on surgery. You might feel a bit more neutral towards the changes to your body if the rest of you is on fleek."

IsItBullshit,fdbdua9,t1_fdbarb3,1578256431.0,"'Holiday' here is the equivalent to your 'vacation'. In the UK, salaried employees generally get Bank Holidays (Xmas, Easter, Mayday, etc) off on full pay, but you get your annual leave entitlement of top of that. For example, I get the bank holidays paid plus 30 days of annual leave (plus 8 days' paid volunteering leave, but that's quite unusual). 

There is no statutory sick leave limit, but when it comes to sick pay, it varies hugely. At my workplace, after three months you are entitled to six weeks at full pay, and this increases with each year of service (up to 6 months). If you are not entitled to company sick pay, you can claim the statutory sick benefit which is about £95 a week."
