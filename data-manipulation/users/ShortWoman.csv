I would certainly take renting off the table based on what you say here."

Getting off the mortgage is hard. If you have an FHA mortgage, he can assume it. If not, he'll have to refinance to get you out. Either way requires that he have enough income to afford the property on his own. 

TLDR he's not getting you out without having a job, and the two of you should consider burying the hatchet long enough to sell the place and go your separate ways m"

RealEstate,ffjxeyp,t3_etyud1,1580009592.0,"You are right. Can't do 1031 on a primary residence. 

The information you actually need is here and in the publication linked on this page: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc701. Do not take online tax advice from anyone other than the IRS. 

So yeah, if you sell now and don't have extenuating circumstances (job transfer counts, I've done it; suddenly need a wheelchair in a 2 story house probably counts), you'll owe capital gains tax. 

But here's the thing: you only owe taxes on your profit! Not the sales price, not the check you get at closing. Just the profit. And since you haven't owed it that long, you are unlikely to have a large profit. 

But please don't take my word for this. And certainly don't listen to anybody who suggests a 1031. Go read that IRS page and the official publication. It will put your mind at ease."
