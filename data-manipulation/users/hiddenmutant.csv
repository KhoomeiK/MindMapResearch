WitchesVsPatriarchy,fgszz7p,t3_f09dne,1581096181.0,"I’m still pretty insecure about my smile and my laugh, but it helps to see things like this.  I’ve been called “horse face” one too many times, particularly when smiling because my smile is pretty gummy and my teeth are on the larger/longer side.  My laugh gets to be like a weird hiccup (hyuck hyuck sound sort of) which really doesn’t help."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fgszdnv,t1_fgsxmss,1581095823.0,"“Constructive criticism” when it’s good can be sooo good, but so bad when people leave out the constructive part and still think they’re doing you a service.  ALSO be aware of when criticism is wanted *at all.*  

I had to drill it into my partner a couple of times that when I show him a piece of art I made, it’s not an invitation for him to break it down into every improvement that could be made (he’s arguably better at the fundamentals of art than me, but rarely does art from a creative perspective)."
toastme,fgsyach,t3_f03riv,1581095163.0,"The weirdest thing to articulate is that you look very doctoral!  You have a very kind face, and I’m sure your future patients will be happy to have you."
Fabrics,fgsxlj8,t3_f0cfqi,1581094752.0,"I’m not quite knowledgeable enough to recommend you a fabric for certain, but a friend of mine makes highly practical survival/camping/hiking gear, and her approach to pants like that is to make the half below-the-knee removable.  She uses her own processed animal hides though, so I doubt that’s an easy option for you (and different people don’t care for leathery pants).

[Waxed cotton](https://www.outsideonline.com/2298526/original-waterproof-breathable-waxed-cotton-works#close) might be interesting to you though.  I recently waxed a pair of jeans for the winter as a test run, and it worked extremely well.  It’s also going to be a very economical option if that’s important to you!"
fatlogic,fghwr4t,t1_fghrdge,1580796258.0,"Bru, I literally have pectus excavatum towards the right side of my chest, and conversely it forces my left ribs outwards.  My boobs tend to look two different sizes and nipple heights from straight-on, and it’s visible if I wear clothing that shows it.  I’ve never met another female-bodied person that’s had to deal with it since it disproportionately affects DMAB people.

I’ve since given up on bras because I’m lucky enough that my boobs are so small, but I remember what it was like trying to buy them (especially shopping with my mom/grandma and having to eventually just settle on an ill-fitting oversized one because they just assumed “a bra is a bra”).  My rib cage is kinda tilted forward below my bust, so even if I’m theoretically a 28A, the size really never fits properly and my breathing feels way restricted.

I agree with you on the mannequins thing.  Along with vanity sizing, I can’t count the number of times I’ve gone to find an article that was on a mannequin (that appeared my size), only to find even the smallest size is too big.  “Just shop in the juniors/kids section” gets really old too because it’s not really tailored to fit a literal adult.  Nor should I, a literal adult, have to be excluded from the literal adult section of the store."
fatlogic,fghmvad,t1_fgh8l8f,1580788473.0,"It’s one of the saddest directions body positivity could have taken.  Instead of supporting people who have no choice but to live in a body with amputations, skin discoloration (vitiligo, dense freckles/moles, etc), scarring, or visible disabilities (wheelchairs/other movement supports, hearing aids, colostomy bags, etc), we have.... supporting people who could lose weight but would just rather not.

Not to say all overweight people choose not to lose weight, I like seeing active wear for plus-sizes because we should be encouraging fitness and supporting people—as they might still be perceived as “not trying” when they truly are.  But the general message is not really that :/"
AskReddit,fgfx5eh,t3_ey2of6,1580749537.0,"When you peel an orange and all those oils get launched into the air, vanilla and geranium, rosemary, basil, and pine.  I don’t know what to call it, but also that particular way that “men’s” colognes smell vs “women’s” perfumes.  I love wearing just a little bit of old spice (or similar) along with my usual smells.

My partner smells much oilier than any other man I’ve ever encountered, that I don’t know how to place it, but that too.  If he ever wore a bit of all these smells I’d probably instantly be 8 months pregnant."
PornFreeRelationships,fge564r,t1_fgd32xt,1580691610.0,"Your argument is with the wrong person.  Did I say I was condoning the interest *ever?*  No.  I agree with basically every tenet of being porn-free, which is to say that it’s not only the addiction to the material that’s harmful to everyone who watches it, but that the industry itself is also absolutely terrifying and predatory on a nearly unimaginable scale.

I’ve been taken advantage of sexually by men.  I have friends of all genders who have been taken advantage of sexually by men AND women.  But all that’s seemed to have happened here is that commenters descended on the OP (who’s deleted the post as of now anyways) to yell at her about how she needs to drop everything and leave immediately and she’s basically a terrible person for asking any questions.  

Everyone has to start somewhere when it comes to making lifestyle-change decisions, and this isn’t the first time I’ve seen this sub scare someone away like this by chomping at the bit.  Maybe my tone seemed like I wasn’t “taking the situation seriously enough” for how egregious rape is.  My point was to try to help OP not feel overwhelmed in a confusing and quite frightening situation.  If this was an IRL interaction, would you yell at an assault victim just because they’re confused and asking questions you think are “stupid?”"
PornFreeRelationships,fg7z5so,t1_fg7l2z3,1580605246.0,"I don’t feel the need to get into my sordid 13+ year porn addiction, nor my partner’s (his was actually less lengthy and severe compared to mine).  When I say “not proud of”, I don’t just mean some fetishes or kinks that I’d just awkwardly laugh off if they came up in conversation, I mean things that I literally only spoke of when I had the “porn-free conversation” with my partner to be truly transparent with each other.  Granted, nothing illegal, but I couldn’t even begin to think about them as I am now.

The reason I’m in these subreddits isn’t because I need help or support anymore, but to help certain people understand that their situations can change.  My partner was initially skeptical of the idea of porn being as damaging as it is, but he *100% came around* and I know that he’s as porn-free as I am.  People can change, even PA men, and if I’d talked about the things in my relationship when they were occurring in a reddit post like this, I’m sure many commenters would have told me to dump my parter and leave too.

We go to couple’s therapy, equally paid for.  We have open communication about our sexual activities.  He doesn’t try to “play cool” if his friends start talking about porn, and supports the argument of how bad it is.  All of these things took progress, and the nuances of a private relationship can’t be explained in a single reddit post.  

I understand and support people (especially women) who choose to leave their PA partners, but until OP has a conversation with her partner about these things, none of us have any idea how he’ll react.  It’s an addiction like any other, which means if the addict is willing to overcome it, they deserve a chance.  I’ve had friends who were addicts in various forms, and kicked the addictions completely with work and help.  The ones that didn’t, I’m no longer friends with, but they were given the opportunity to change."
PornFreeRelationships,fg7cbto,t1_fg777su,1580589086.0,"This is the best comment here.  I was a little shocked to see OP’s questions and comments being downvoted, just because she isn’t immediately agreeing that leaving him *right this second* is the way to go.  None of us know her full relationship dynamic.

This is **NOT** to condone his behavior.  Absolutely talk to him, and make sure you have proof when you confront him (pictures of his searches, history, etc), so *if he ends up trying to downplay or deny,* you’ll have something tangible and won’t unwittingly let yourself be gaslit and convinced “it’s nothing.”

I’m not proud to think of my past porn search history, or my partner’s, but it was something we discussed very transparently when we ultimately made the decision to go porn-free, and we both have been for a year and a half now.  Yes, this should not continue, but give him the chance if YOU feel he deserves it.  If he doesn’t take your chance seriously and tosses it in the figurative trash?  Then it’s time to start packing bags."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fg4f95e,t3_ewnu20,1580502324.0,"My fondest gym memories are when I’ve been there alone and asked swole chadmen to spot me on bench.  I’m quite small, and can’t bench a whole lot yet, but I’ve never had one of them say a word about it, and more often then not they’re very encouraging and supportive without being condescending at all."
