NoFap,fejyjyr,t3_epfsk6,1579188771.0,"There’s honestly a lot of reasons why it’s not taken seriously. 

For one, porn talk is seen as mostly a taboo topic. I for one, would have loved to discussed the dangers of porn addiction to my high school classmates. I’m sure most of them would have disagreed and continue on with their coomer mentality, but at least I would have my point across. I think it would be essential for schools to talk about the dangers of porn addiction. Even though yes, porn “supposed” to be for 18+ year olds, a lot of boys watch it at a young age.

It’s actually extremely concerning when you look at it. If it was 30 years ago, it was almost impossible for a 12 year old to find porn. I mean you either had to have known someone who had it and was willing to give it to you, or be unfortunate enough to have parents who watched porn. 

Nowadays, with literally every middle school kid having a smartphone, all they have to do is search up porn on their phone. They didn’t have to face the hurdles that the older peers had to face.

Another problem is how normalized porn masturbation are in today’s world. It’s seen as okay for a guy to spend hours jacking off to some hardcore sex scenes. Apparently there’s nothing wrong with that according to most masturbators.

So the problem is that masturbation and porn are taboo topics and are seen as normal by a lot of people. So telling them to not watch porn and to stop masturbating will feel like a personal attack. It really sucks when you’re living in a time where hedonism is a widely accepted ideology, when in fact it actually leads to depression."
NoFap,fegyy5k,t1_fegrr27,1579105630.0,It just feels good to finally let go of my fears. That’s really the best part about it.

NoFap,feggq18,t1_feg7inj,1579092200.0,Yeah it’s really hard for me to not stare at women’s feet as well. I go to a college in Florida so girls are wearing flip flops all the time. Hopefully I get myself out of this mess.

TrueOffMyChest,febch3v,t1_febbjnz,1578957465.0,"Well right now I’m interested in my field of study (aerospace engineering). I used to play clarinet and just got back into playing saxophone.

When I have the time I sometimes draw portraits, it’s usually time consuming though. I also love cooking and have gotten into cooking food from scratch. I’m also interested in learning programming languages and I’ve gotten into learning python and java.

TrueOffMyChest,febbmee,t1_feb0rgi,1578957189.0,I guess the problem is trying to signal that I want to be more than just friends. I’ve never really had female friends so it’s definitely had a negative effect on me.

I really only have some people I kind of know on my dorm floor. But I really don’t have a deep emotional connection.
TrueOffMyChest,feb3x2t,t1_feb3njd,1578955215.0,Well really it’s mostly for the mutual affection and intimacy. I want to feel loved and connected to someone on a deeper level.
