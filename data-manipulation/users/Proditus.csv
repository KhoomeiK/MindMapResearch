AskReddit,ffic5sg,t1_ffhoiy9,1579970368.0,"That's been at the top of these sorts of threads every year since I joined Reddit. Eventually it's gonna happen I guess. Some lucky person will have the privilege of editing their comment with ""well shit"" and being showered with gold.

A similar thing happened with Harper Lee that one time, and probably a couple others who have slipped my mind. Crossing my fingers that Reddit doesn't ""kill"" any more famous elderly novelists at least. Cormac McCarthy still has a book on the way and he'd better not kick the bucket until I've read it."
wow,ffi7733,t1_ffi1sh9,1579966892.0,"It would honestly have made perfect sense for the Vindicaar to make a move on Orgrimmar during the war campaign as the Alliance's gambit to swiftly end the war early on. 

Not anticipating that the Goblins had already amassed enough Azerite to upgrade their cannon into more than a mere ballistic launcher, the Vindicaar approaches from across the sea, escorting a small Alliance fleet, and is swiftly blasted out of the sky. What remains of the Alliance fleet is quickly demoralized as pieces of the Vindicaar start raining down upon them, turning back towards Stormwind. 

Continuing the cutscene, half of Bilgewater Harbor is annihilated in the aftermath. The camera cuts to Gallywix, observing the blast through a pair of binoculars from the safety of his pleasure palace, who laughs and says something an warmongering economic opportunist who just struck gold would say. Then cut again to the northern wall of Orgrimmar, where Sparky Boi and a bunch of other soldiers are manning the parapets in preparation for the Alliance invasion, simply astonished at how the scope of war has changed and fearful of the destructive power of Azerite."

Sorry, that's the best I got. I bet they still taste absolutely delicious."
wow,ffdqkdt,t1_ffd04ev,1579826548.0,"The Maw has always been around, but was normally reserved for only the most evil souls. However, at some unspecified point shortly before the beginning of Legion, something began causing *all* souls to go there.

Sylvanas, who we now know has some sort of arrangement with the Jailer of the Maw, has been working to cause as much death as possible to send all those souls there as a calculated act.

We don't know for sure that she *caused* everyone to go there, but as one of the few individuals who was even aware of what was happening and has made an ally of the entity at the center of it all, she is very much directly involved."

apple,ffcfk3l,t1_ffceomu,1579798379.0,"Android has permission prompts too, just not repeated ones for every individual attempt like iOS. If people keep mindlessly pressing ""yes"" for every prompt that appears on their screen, that's on them."
ffxiv,ffc1r18,t1_ffc0frh,1579789345.0,"According to the Wiki at least, since I'm not willing to dig any deeper, the chapter of the manga in which Rock Lee first appeared (chapter 36) was first published in July 2000, which is a few months after FLCL. Rock Lee didn't get an anime appearance until 2003."
wow,ffbckes,t1_ffar0ua,1579759692.0,"World of Warcraft: The Hunt for Sargeras

Sargeras is let out of titan jail on parole, but fails to check in with his parole officer, Illidan Stormrage, for one of his mandatory bi-weekly check-ins. As the Champion of Azeroth, it falls to you to join Illidan on a journey through the lands of Lower W'est S'ide, into the hood of the mighty Sargeras himself, to bring him to justice and put an end to the illegal recreational fel trade once and for all."
ffxiv,ffb8ni3,t1_ffakdfr,1579755186.0,"It's a balancing act. Go too far in the other direction and you end up with Blizzard, disregarding just about all player feedback because ""you don't want that, you think you do, but you don't,"" and then being surprised when active sub counts start dropping."
Android,ffb589s,t1_ffaxtzq,1579752125.0,"Obviously not for making calls or texting, but the 3DS had apps and an app store, an internet browser, chat features, local networking, and so on. It's not what we'd expect out of a modern smartphone but if an iPod Touch counts as a device similar to the iPhone, then the 3DS is at least smartphone-like in base functionality."
Android,ffb3lsy,t1_ffb072c,1579750919.0,"One thing to note is that Samsung's displays are by default a bit taller than your average phone might be. They designed One UI so that even if you're using one of their taller devices, menu items are within range of your thumbs without having to reach up to the top of the screen. 

It may seem like a waste of space, but it was a rather conscious user-friendly decision for which they've gotten a lot of praise."

wow,ffb26p6,t1_ffax1s2,1579749921.0,"That is a good point. For all we know he might be involved with the Kyrian plot line, since Uther the Lightbringer is apparently a central figure there. Freeing Arthas from the Maw so he can have his inevitable redemption arc and be a true Paladin like Uther sounds like something Blizzard would do at this point for their ""in case of dropping subs break glass"" emergency plan."
wow,ffaslbz,t1_ffabhw4,1579743525.0,"They said the same thing about BfA, though. 

But then losing artifacts caused significant class changes across the board, and we can likely expect the same when we transition away from Azerite armor and essences and move towards Covenant abilities"
wow,ffas7qv,t1_ffaku7m,1579743269.0,"Arthas is definitely coming back. They're not just going to throw the new Lich King in the center of the plot, do all this revamping of the Death Knight starting experience, go to the place where all dead people go, where Sylvanas *saw* Arthas, and not have an eventual confrontation with Arthas himself.

The guy probably ended up in the Maw before Sylvanas' whole plot started sending everyone there. We're gonna end up with a raid made entirely of old raid bosses, aren't we?"
