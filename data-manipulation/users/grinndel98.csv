It burned like hell where it hit me on my back and neck. Sure made me run faster though, and I can truthfully say I've been shot with a shotgun! LOL"

My Dad owned a Mobile Home Dealership, so I was constantly seeing all of the latest trends in home furnishings. Remember all of the heavy, dark stained wood furniture? Mediteranean, I believe they called it, or Spanish Mission.... LOL I still love Avocado Green, I'm guilty."

I was a happy asshole most of my life. 

I still enjoy life, for the most part. 

Make every single day count.... For  something. 

Don't put off doing something you've always dreamed of doing, until you retire, or until you have this, or that.... You may never live to see those days, or you may be in such shape that you can't do those things anymore. 

I did everything I could. I drank, ate, breathed, every new experience I could, when I was young. I never thought I would live as long as I have, so I knew I had to drive myself harder, and compress more into a shorter time.

I'm so thankful that I did. I've seen and done enough, that I can let go when the time comes. 

Seize the day."

And it damn sure doesn't mean that a bunch of needle dicked town leaders get together and try to squeeze a business man out of business, by mis-using your authority. That is what happened. Now everyone is trying to rewrite history. They pushed Marv into a corner, and then started swatting their dicks across his face, rubbing it in....

Autoflowers,ff9uafb,t1_ff9t84h,1579721482.0,"Yep, but I'm always nervous about trying new breeders, it sucks horse dick to waste 90 days of my life on some shit genetics. I've been burned by the ""big name"" places just about every time, back when I was really getting the ""bell curve"" of learning to grow autos. LOL. I look through Instagram a  lot, and have tons of people who are involved in the cannabis business, in one form or another. That's how I figure out who is really putting out some sweet weed, by seeing all of these people with tons of experience, raving about some unknown  breeder, and then trying to find them and get some seeds!
Have a good 'un!"

This morning I harvested the last of my last grow, as the new girls are taking over the tent, just in the nick of time... Whew. Two of the three were his mystery seeds, they had quart gatorade bottle sized apical buds, and the ones around the edges weren't much smaller. Very dense too, not airy bud. I am getting mostly skunk aroma from the two mystery plants, a serious skunk odor. I love it. 

Good luck, good growin'!"

I used Coast of Maine amendments for the first time on my last grow. A mix of my own supersoil/compost, because I live so far away from where CoM sells their bagged supersoil. I ordered most of their granular amendments, and liquid squid for during flowering. I'm really impressed with Coast of Maine products, every thing I ordered off of Amazon was extremely fresh, and rich looking and smelling. I grow totally organic and this time all  of the smells/aromas of my weed came out. Its worth the cost for their products, I'm convinced. I just trimmed and jarred a Cherry Pebbles and a Hawaiian Skunk this morning. I can still smell the skunk aroma on my clothes. !

I haven't smelled such good, strong, smelling skunk weed...... In a long assed time.

Beautiful plants, every single one of them, but that skunk.... oh man, that Skunk...."

You can shove the crap out of someone that is standing/walking in front of you, then you turn around and look at the person behind you, as if they were the ones to shove YOU. And just keep doing it until they get off the bus/train.
