Organ, especially Hammond has other techniques than piano, you may be familiar with notes and chords but the playing technique and keyboard feel are different. Look up “Hammond smear/glissando”, using drawbars, and using the Leslie dynamically to see essential techniques that differ from the piano. 

You should definitely look into trying to find a Hammond L100 or M3. Eventually you would need a Leslie, or an alternative like a Motion Sound, or a guitar effects pedal that is a “Leslie sim”."

Guitar,fezu01c,t3_er042e,1579461638.0,"You’re supposed to carry it on. Try to get an earlier boarding zone to ensure you have an open space, otherwise they will have to move other peoples carry-on bags to fit your guitar in the event you are boarding at the end and the flight is full. Make sure you watch the other passengers, I had to stop someone once who’s mind must have been in outer space, trying to put a bag on top of my guitar. Usually people have a clue and won’t do that. 

The carry on bag sizes do not apply to music instruments. If you have a guitar, violin, saxophone, etc that can fit in the overhead bin, then it goes. They don’t want a social media PR nightmare of them gate checking your instrument and it getting damaged. I always use a gig bag with my SG because on full flights you may need to squeeze the guitar on top of a few small suitcases. Obviously you don’t want to cram it in there, but some of those compartments are bigger than others. A hard case may take up too much room, and will be a pain to lug around the airport (back straps are great). Good luck, it’s not a big deal"

I have the Korg ARP Odyssey app, it doesn’t sound better or function any better than the Behringer Odyssey (the app does stay in tune and is less noisy than the white face vintage one I briefly owned however). 

A sacrifice is using a Nord instead of a Fender Rhodes, using a Gibson SG standard rather than a 61 Reissue SG, a Fulltone Tape Delay rather than an Echoplex Ep3. A soft synth isn’t a substitute for a 4 voice para Minimoog (which never existed in the physical world until Behringer invented it). The Moog system 15 app on an iPad isn’t a substitute for a nice Eurorack system, and that Eurorack system most likely wouldn’t rival a System 15/55.
