earlsweatshirt,fepi5yn,t3_eqb0ga,1579321118.0,EAST is good because i associate it with really dank videos. But also just because earl made it and he doesn’t really make bad music. My personal favorite on FOC is El Toro Combo Meal but i’m also a Mavi fan.
teenagers,feo57di,t3_epw95a,1579295295.0,My parents are drug testing me and i have an F in a class that i had a B in last semester. This is the most relatable thing i’ve seen all day.

BringMeTheHorizon,fd9yhgd,t3_ekdp8p,1578239600.0,"I’ve been a die hard for CYB and Suicide season for years... But i respect their decisions for their music no matter what, even if i dont listen to TTS or amo. It’s part of being a conscientious music fan. Yeah, I prefer the old albums, but i would hate to align myself with those who give BMTH shit for trying something new."
