A lot of it seems to be learned (I have friends that have multiple beardies and each herd has similar temperaments) but they'll definitely let you know how they feel about you. Mine has been around a lot of people and seems to he generally sociable. One that belongs to a friend hs always acted aggressively towards me and I seem to be the only one she reacts to like that.  My horned mountain dragon (different species) is as antisocial as I've ever seen and I have to handle her daily or she gets very bitey. Others of her species I've handled have been quite docile. Given time (and food bribes) most of them will develop a level of comfort with most people."
aww,fcg4pii,t1_fcavou8,1577636432.0,Maybe I'm just doing bath time wrong. Mine has never pooped in the tub. He doesnt seem to mind pooping in his tank but he immediately wants out afterwards.
aww,fcau2gq,t1_fcap6wj,1577576622.0,"As for potty training, if someone figures that out they can have all my money for the secret. For the free roaming, yes, a lot of beardie owners let them roam in the house. It let's them get more excercise than just staying in a tank. I would also assume it alleviates boredom though I dont know how they feel about it. Mine tends to get restless if left in his tank for more than a day or two so I will let him run laps around my room. I know some owners that have leashes and will walk them outside.
They're just like other pets in that you have to be aware of what they can get into. They also like to crawl into small, dark spaces so it can lead to some aggravating games of hide and seek."
