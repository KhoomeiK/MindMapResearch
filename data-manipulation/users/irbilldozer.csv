- **Leather:** Black Shell Cordovan

- **Images:** [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/n8fwScw)
- **Notes:** These have never been worn despite being from the GMTO that /u/grizzly_giant ran in July 2018. I sat on them for a long time debating on what to do, ultimately I decided I should let them go before I wear them so someone can get them in their pristine state rather than slightly worn if I change my mind. As a result the shell has started to patina a bit, I highly recommend looking at the photos with sun in them. These shoes have begun to take on a really interesting color, the shell appears black generally but when the sun hits it right they appear a very deep rich brown.

piano,ffwhry3,t1_ffve847,1580301457.0,"I just got an FP10 last week, I think the speakers sound fine (one of the things the FP30 is supposed to improve upon). Most people here have said you only need the single pedal until you're many years into learning, at which point you could sell your FP10 if you really need more pedals. The only other feature the FP30 offers is recording directly onto the unit or flash drive, where as with the FP10 you need to hook up to your PC (I think you may be able to record with Rolands app also?).

I was in the same boat where the FP10 was already sort of pushing my budget on what I wanted to spend, but it gets enough praise for how the keys feel that I figured it was worth the extra money over a P45. I felt like it is really down to how much those extra features matter to you for £100, for me it was going to be a $200 difference."

>Right, but you can't do that without giving 1 trillion to the richest people in the country. Giving people access to better education is great, but giving out 1 trillion to the richest people in country does literally nothing. 

I'll be honest I'm not sure where to take this discussion because you seem really focused on a very warped view that people who went to college are all incredibly wealthy. The richest people in this country probably never took a student loan, their parents paid cash or donated to have a new building put on campus. The people who need forgiveness aren't rich or they wouldn't have the debt to begin with. 

I think I make decent money and am currently paying $700 a month to my loans every month right now and I graduated a decade ago. That is almost the same as our mortgage."
GlobalOffensive,fflsoax,t1_ffll9fx,1580043664.0,"So maybe don't look at it as a hand out. Look at it as giving all those people access to college, the ones you just said are missing out. Part of the plan with at least Bernie's student debt forgiveness is that state institutions at the college level should be publicly accessible and free just like K-12.

I do believe that swiftly reformatting 18% of our economy and eliminating private insurance for millions of Americans is not a realistic strategy, so we need to provide a new way forward on healthcare for all Americans.

He ends saying it isn't a realistic strategy. All the lingo following is about bringing prices down and price controlling. It sounds like he just wants more regulations but want to sell it as ""Medicare for All"".

To be clear I'm not trying to have my head in the sand, so if I've drawn the wrong conclusions from his campaign please enlighten me.

TameImpala,ff3x0az,t1_ff3kus0,1579550695.0,"> Fair. I can see your argument here, although I don't think Tame Impala's genre evolution has a sliver of the same artistic integrity and risk taking that Radiohead had. Kevins songs are simpler and more radio friendly than ever, versus Radiohead who (starting with Kid A) made something experimental that pushed music forward in general.

To me Kid A is the very epitome of taking risks for artists. After OK Computer, Radiohead could have made any number of rock albums and just taken the world by storm. They could have relentlessly cashed in on that wave. Instead they did a sharp left turn and decided they weren't going to put in a box with a label. They made an album literally no one expected them to make and as a result probably widened a lot of people's music taste in that one LP. I honestly can't think of another artist that big, that took such a major shift, and still managed to make an absolutely amazing album. Not to mention that album turned out so many solid B sides that we basically got Amnesiac out of that too? Insane."
TameImpala,ff3wfru,t1_ff27t8h,1579550335.0,">I don't think it is as much he thinks he's ""explored an entire genre in 2 records"" as much as he doesn't care about playing ""rock"" or ""psych rock"" (whatever that even means exactly) and never really did. He just cared/cares about creating music that is inspiring to him at that moment in time.

Exactly, I've seriously been baffled by some of the comments specifically around Kevin needing to ""return"" to ""psych rock"" roots of Innerspeaker and Lonerism. 

Does it not occur to very many people that Kevin never considered himself a ""psych rock"" artist? That is just what he wanted to make at the time or how he felt he could best convey what he had in his head then. He probably just sees himself as a guy making albums that are cohesive within themselves, he isn't ever trying to go and make ""psych rock"". It is sort of unreasonable to expect him to focus on a single genre until he has played it out."
Hiphopcirclejerk,ff34y1r,t1_ff2x37y,1579533779.0,">It does though because very often artists glom onto their wider appeal and go more and more commercial

I mean doesn't Death Grips claim to be above all that? Seems like an awfully good test of their character to me. Or do you not have faith that they mean what they say?"

2019 has been an amazing year though between Outer Peace, Soul Trash, and the video of Live From Trona being made more accessible on YouTube."

All prices are OBO so feel free to message me if you're interested and walk to talk price. Please note though I'm not really interested in trades, but I am very negotiable on prices and willing to work out very good deals for multiples purchases. One exception to the trade rule would be records but I'd only be looking for [specific vinyl](https://www.discogs.com/wantlist?page=1&limit=100&sort=artist&sort_order=asc&user=d_imil), not looking for random albums in bulk or anything like that.

I have went through a lot of trouble in terms of sizing with goodyearwelt shoes. I've ended up with a lot of shoes that it has taken me a long time to accept the fact that I need to let them go. Hopefully my inability to properly size shoes can help you score a nice pair for cheap.

Before the listing details here is a [photo of all shoes with timestamp & username](https://i.imgur.com/McNYy55.jpg)

- **Maker/Model:** Trickers Robert Derby
- **Size:** 12 (6 fitting) aka UK 12 Wide
- **Last:** W2298
- **Leather:** Black Shell Cordovan
- **Sole:** Dainite
- **Price:** ~~_$450_~~ _$425_
- **Wears/Condition:** 0 wears
- **Images:** [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/n8fwScw)
- **Notes:** These have never been worn despite being from the GMTO that /u/grizzly_giant ran in July 2018. I sat on them for a long time debating on what to do, ultimately I decided I should let them go before I wear them so someone can get them in their pristine state rather than slightly worn if I change my mind. As a result the shell has started to patina a bit, I highly recommend looking at the photos with sun in them. These shoes have begun to take on a really interesting color, the shell appears black generally but when the sun hits it right they appear a very deep rich brown.

- **Maker/Model:** Crown Northhampton
- **Size:** 12.5G (UK sizing, this is basically a 13E tennis shoe for US)
- **Last:** (the shoe style is the Overstone Derby)
- **Leather:** CF Stead White Calf Leather
- **Sole:** Gum sole
- **Price:** ~~_$150_~~ _$140_
- **Wears/Condition:** 0 wears
- **Images:** [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/XWZ3KNC)
- **Notes:** Never worn, but please note on the one toe cap the leather has a slight crease that you can see clearly in the photo in case that bothers you. I put these on and just immediately realized I couldn't pull them off and return shipping to the UK was going to run me way too much to be worth it.

- **Maker/Model:** Quoddy Camp Driver

- **Wears/Condition:** 0 wears
