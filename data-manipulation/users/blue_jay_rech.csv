Now that I'm in a relationship it's a little different. For example, I want to have all you can eat Brazilian barbecue (rodozio) and my fiancee doesn't like it. I have made plans with him to go for almost a year and at the last minute he always convinces me not to go. It actually is a little weird to eat at this specific kind of restaurant alone, but i have made up my mind and I am going somewhen next week by myself."

I must have sent about a hundred emails until I got an internship which allowed me to get into a master's program. Good.luck, and don't give up!"
