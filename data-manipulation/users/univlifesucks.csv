AskMen,fe7cr29,t3_enlczz,1578912873.0,"2017-I was a international student in USA (Iowa). Therr was this place called DEN which was like a common room in our dorm where everyone can come, meet and play board games. 

There was a an american guy I had a huge crush on and to get closer to him I used to play board games along with these guys (who simply didnt mind me hanging out with them , cool people). our friendship grew and we became close friends.

I know he somehow figured out that I was into him and really liked him. we used to talk a lot on phones , share memes. used to have dinner together bc it was compulsory to have meal plan. he sometimes used to allow me to use his free meals.

2018- the academic year was over. the dorm life was over . everyone moved out and we went our separate ways. we still stayed in touch, still besties. for fun I used to play games with him where he used to send me his tinder likes and I used to tell him to swipe right or left. 

2019- my life fucked up and I had to come back to my country and every person I knew from USA stopped talking to me bc what was the point right? but not him he is the only person who is still talking to me and is still here when everyone has left. I told him how no one is talking and i asked him ""why havent you left yet,I am useless to you anyways right?, u dont give a shit about me anyways right?"" he said "" if I didnt give a shit about you I wouldn't be here talking to you"".  I know I said we had a friendship but deep down inside I really loved him and out of curiosity, late but, I asked him why he never dated him. 
this was his reply -i wanted to, but I knew you would have had to go back to your country at one point in ur life. And it wouldn't have been fair for you or for me to be so far from each other. 
at first I was sad but then i thought about it and it does make sense.  
we still love talking to each other and now I think he would be much more happier with someone else because I simply dont deserve him. he deserves someone who is beautiful and close to him. Even if he gets married now, I will be super happy for him because I know he will be happy with her. 
sorry it's too long"
