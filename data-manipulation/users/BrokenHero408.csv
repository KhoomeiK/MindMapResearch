pics,ffk0vjf,t3_etr9un,1580012393.0,And if we look to the left we see this fucking post again.
SanJose,ffjqzit,t1_ffhkg02,1580004677.0,Haha when will folk learn criminals don't follow laws.
SanJose,ffjqtrw,t1_ffjqp3c,1580004572.0,Ah I read taco bell. Haven't been to bravo since they closed the one on the Southside.
SanJose,ffjql6w,t1_ffjnvsd,1580004410.0,Do you look at the value menu? Lol many options for $1 it's only expensive if you're dumb enough to pay 8-10 for a combo.
SanJoseFood,ffhjrxp,t1_ffh5jid,1579938465.0,"Well if consistency is all you require Michelin to evaluate then yes, good luck out there. I assume Chili's will be visited soon as I heard their burgers and drinks are as consistent as they come."
SanJoseFood,ffh3c2u,t1_ffh2k8g,1579921979.0,"I agree it's lost a step therefore it lost it's star. You're the first person I've seen going to bat so hard for veg house. It's certainly good but most would agree it's not Michelin quality, nothing sepeates it from non reviewed restaurants."
SanJoseFood,ffh1vzd,t1_ffh1a0r,1579920882.0,I did. Veg house isn't even close to being recognized as a single star restaurant it shouldn't be surprising it hasn't even been reviewed.
SanJoseFood,ffgzrp4,t3_etg2q6,1579919281.0,There's no way in hell Veg house gets a star when ADEGA lost theirs and their food & presentaion is above veg house in just about every way..
fbody,ffgzeef,t3_esoueb,1579919003.0,OP asked about coilovers and folks commenting about spring and shock combos lol
Sneakers,ffgytme,t1_fffpepp,1579918568.0,"Typical GR SB quality of the last few years, stiff, OK suede."
LivingMas,ffgwjfv,t1_ffb18u9,1579916870.0,I swear I went to one middle '10s in Eugene while visiting family?? Maybe it was something else but I coulda swore it was a Chili's
LivingMas,ffgwc7i,t1_ffgvg34,1579916723.0,That's not bad considering you went to school there so your ability to go out and try new things is alot easier than someone who Flys in for a few days. Plus 50% off? Yea I'd be there too if I were you haha
LivingMas,ffgu73f,t1_ffgu5av,1579915166.0,"I Def will, thanks for the info m8."
LivingMas,ffgtwr2,t1_ffbxxuc,1579914955.0,Seriously. Like when I see people going to outback steakhouse and apple bees it's confusing considering the comparable options that you can't find anywhere else.
LivingMas,ffgtqe9,t1_ffcuozm,1579914825.0,Idk what's up with the hate lol yea we all love taco bell here but it's fuckin las vegas lmao the amount of just food you can experience would take you weeks to check let alone everything else the city has to offer.
LivingMas,ffgtjqe,t1_ffb9mzd,1579914691.0,"How long ago? Gunna be in Vegas next month, gunna have to check it out if so. Don't wanna take a 30 min Uber and find out they don't have um haha"
LivingMas,ffgtf83,t1_ffclkbb,1579914600.0,"My local Cantina charges on the kiosk, app, and in person."
LivingMas,ffgrw2w,t3_etb9n7,1579913484.0,As game changing as the rolled chicken tacos. You could just pour franks red hot onto your TB if that's what you wanted.
oddlysatisfying,ffglsr3,t1_ffg33gu,1579909203.0,"There was quite a bit of red and dark orange glass at a local beach literally called glass beach. Now, since idiots have been taking bag fulls of glass from the beach there's very little glass of any color (as of last year anyway)"
SanJoseFood,ffdjj4y,t1_ffcxn30,1579822211.0,They have a brick and mortar also. The truck is open after standard store hours.
SanJoseFood,ffawlvr,t3_esf8lo,1579746183.0,How do you compare it to say Gen or Qpot (literally the only 2 KBBQ spots I've been to in SJ)
personalfinance,ff85fyk,t1_ff852hg,1579666500.0,"I've owned 2 beater Honda civics, both 5 speeds. Bulletproof. I wouldn't trust any old, high milage automatic though unless we're talking about something as old as a TH350 or 400. I wouldn't even trust a high milage 700r that's never been rebuilt. The Toyotas are around but you're not getting a decent 90s camry for $1500 unless you plan on pushing it home. But I guess it depends on people's defenition of decent lol"
personalfinance,ff84k8t,t1_ff83n48,1579665814.0,"I feel like alot of financial advisers have this same issue. They'll recommend you spend the change in your front pocket for a car while they jump into their 2020 7 series bimmer under a complete power train warranty that they'll return at the end of their lease for another warrantied vehicle, not having to worry about the constant mechanical and therefore reliability issues a car THAT cheap will almost always bring unless you were lucky enough to stumble upon one of those ""grandma owned for the past 25 years. Only went to the grocery store and back. Never drivin in the rain"" Toyotas or Hondas for a few grand."
Sneakers,ff816wh,t3_erzcox,1579663304.0,Like the SB city pack except boring.
space,ff7pr6a,t3_ervuig,1579655371.0,Will cost roughly as much as the actual ISS
