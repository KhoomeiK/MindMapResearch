sysadmin,ffh8y59,t1_ffh63h2,1579926529.0,I think you're misunderstanding.  I'm talking about removing OnTap off a NetApp and installing Linux (and various other arrays).

Let this be a lesson.  You have a job ahead of you now because no matter what you do short of ""shred""ding the disk... I can restore filesystem and retrieve some data."

I'm doing hardwood floor in my house right now.  The floor doesn't start until transitions are dealt with.  My first threshold was easy.  There isn't one, Lol.  Hardwood goes straight through the threshold.  Hallway and three bedrooms will be one seamless master bedroom will have floor rotated 90 deg parallel to joist.  Ask me how I'm prepping for that and I'll tell you how I cut up the sub floor and blocked every joist 12"" oc.  Fuuuun.  Wife loooves me right know, Lol!"

homelab,fffxjiu,t3_etdc1c,1579893979.0,"This is why everyone flashes their raid cards to pass-through.  Linux will land data on disk and the IO will pause until the disk says Yea it's landed.  It's slow but safe and not proprietary.

I am about to move my 6 internal OSDs on my single node to an external Promise Tech array.  This exposes me to a proprietary raid back end.  I am not pleased but I'm stuck and I'm less happy about that.  The disks will also need to be configured as raid 0 luns and presented to each host over direct-attached-sas (1 host 1 sas link 1 gig-e link for cluster replication 1 gig-e link for client access).  I'll have the option to add up to 4 hosts and 4 OSDs each.  This will force me to keep OSD count low which will help keep mem usage low as I expand the cluster.  I'm using cheap ass Core i7's / 16 gig mem nodes.  The crux is the J610 array is like a 10 year old array at this point and anything can happen to the guts."
homelab,fffw2qr,t1_fffp4dp,1579893064.0,">nsing. I think for the license they had it only let you add 1 mount?!? no clue, I didnt get into it. either way it was cash and I hadn't had a contract in a bit. its feast or famine.

That VTL license is draconian.  When it represents 30% of your infrastructure budget ... fuck that shit..."

Keep it in mind what these devices are for and you'll see they do their job well."
