But is she offering anything that a sweet guy would find attractive? Is she a sweet girl? Does a sweet romantic guy dream of finding a chubby, pregnant, divorced mum of three to shower his sweetness upon? Is that the romantic dream?

I guess it's fine to want something, we all do, but you have to be realistic and think about whether you have something to offer in return.

And how is this sweet mild mannered guy going to get on with the dual parenting shit? What are you actually exposing this guy to? Drama that he won't know how to cope with? Or actual danger from a psychotic ex husband?

But why think about what is good for him when you've got bills to pay, huh?"

The implication is that they are providing access to them and that should be enough.

The idea is that they are so used to guys approaching them for sex that they believe they have intrinsic value beyond simply their bodies. That is why they do not realise that as they age their value drops dramatically. They actually think that because lots of men are still willing to fuck them (or were willing to do so in the past) that they must still have value.

A better prospect for a marriage partner (if that is what you are seeking) is someone with an actual brain who figured out that most men that approach them want just sex and ignore these type of men. This type of woman also figured out that a man wanting to have sex with them does not add any value to them, even if the guy is hot, and is more concerned with men who want a serious committed relationship. This type of woman is a lot more likely to settle down in her early twenties with a decent guy in a serious relationship, rather than riding the carousel until she is thirty then wondering where all the good guys are.

The problem she has encountered is the reason the bar is not set very high, because women can get by on their looks and make it their achievement to have children.

What she has done though is to squander this. Rather than furthering her career in the absence of starting a family, she has rested on her laurels and had some fun dating. She probably never had to pay for anything more than the rent on her tiny apartment, while having fun with guy after guy and never thinking to find a decent one and settle down. 

And now that the fun is over she wants to get a second bite of the cherry and find the nice family man that she didn't bother with when she had the potential.

Sad."
WhereAreAllTheGoodMen,fdqcz07,t3_emltow,1578663347.0,"The use of the term harem here is ridiculous.

A harem suggest a wealthy male with enough money to support multiple **faithful** wives to live with him and serve him/run his household.

This is somewhat of an achievement or indication of status as it means the man has enough wealth to do this and the women will have had other men to choose from but chose to be in a long term committed relationship with him.

The men in this woman's ""harem"" are simply on a list of desperate simps who this woman allows to plow her regularly. There is no skill or work involved. They are not faithful to her or interested in her beyond sex.

Just to make it clear:

Male harem = the women a man effectively owns as his wives who he has managed to convince to live with him and serve him faithfully based on his own material success.

Female harem = the multiple dudes who currently want to fuck her disgusting body while they probably fuck many others."

How is that kind of thinking unique to Trump? People on both sides of the political spectrum hate whole groups of people due to the actions of some.

Many critics of Trump literally say that anyone who voted for him must be Nazi white supremacists."

Why would she write this? It's literal man-repellent.

How would anyone know what *she* considers to be using her or fucking her over? She might see breaking up with her as fucking her over.

I can't believe anyone would think ""oh, that's ok, I won't fuck her over, it'll be fine""."

WhereAreAllTheGoodMen,fdolrsp,t1_fdnlb6v,1578607728.0,"I figure these types of broken people probably either end up with other broken people in bizarre open/degenerate relationships. Maybe they end up with some old rich guy who just wants a trophy wife and the fact that he's with a porn star is something to boast about for him. But they're essentially prostitutes on retainer.

There's no way these types of women can have normal relationships. I think most of them are abuse victims and hooked on drugs. I certainly wouldn't want one raising my kids or being in a position where she could very easily take all my money.

There's a million reasons not to get involved with them from how damaged they are to do it in the first place to how different they are to a normal person in their values or their attitude to sex. No doubt that's all misogynistic to some of the degenerate freaks out there."

JordanPeterson,fdmuiam,t3_em763o,1578566414.0,"Progressive far left nutcase types generally use whatever argument furthers their cause. They don't look at the facts then decide what cause to follow. They choose what facts support their cause. This is why you will never find them saying ""oh, well I normally support this movement that is pro POC, but I can see how white working class men are disadvantaged here so they need more support in this case"".

They support whatever they support and deny any evidence that goes against it because they only care about power and their side winning.

They can probably accept physical differences because they are too obvious to ignore and they also often advantage people of colour who are often more athletic than white people.

With IQ, if it was found that POC had lower IQs, it would weaken any case they have that says that POC are oppressed because then someone could claim that black people are poor because they have lower IQs. Equally, taking for example working class white men, if someone claimed they had low IQs so needed help with employment, that would disrupt a narrative of being always a privileged group, so they would have less power.

The far left will twist facts to create the narrative they want and IQ makes it a little harder to do."

I didn't claim it was a dichotomy, but I suppose it is. Going quietly about your transition and making a big deal it of it is a dichotomy. You cannot do both.

Do you think I have said anything counter to this?"
