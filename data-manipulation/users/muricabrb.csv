aussievapers,ffkad1m,t3_etxaam,1580019547.0,"Go ahead, it's fine.. as long as the flavors blend well you won't have any issues. I was vaping a 25mg salt nic strawberry & watermelon flavor but it was too strong, so I add a bit of 3mg blueberry freebase to it. The flavors go well together and it cuts the harshness from the salt nic liquid.

Checked with some brewers and they said it's no problem, just make sure you shake the pod a little as the two liquids can separate if left alone for some time.

My current mix is about 25% of the free base liquid and the rest is the salt nic. It's been great and I've been on this for about 2 months now."
