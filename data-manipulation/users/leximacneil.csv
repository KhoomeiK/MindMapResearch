bipolar,ff8xhhw,t1_ff8l6i2,1579699273.0,"“Spoiled goods spilt/ how can i not cry? Is a reference to not crying at spilled milk. Because in reality he is just one boy, however it felt like we had something good. “Brick walls matched with cement” is a metaphor for how my walls around my heart have grown harder and stronger not. “Sunshine ripped from seedlings” talks about how all the hope that i had for us in the future to grow together has been taken away."
bipolar,ff8xbpm,t1_ff8l6i2,1579699130.0,"It’s all heartbreak. Crismon snaking through calcified enamal/puzzle pieces piercing bone. That’s how i describe when he told me. His tounge (crimson) snaking through his teeth left me confused to the bones. “Supernovas eclipsing supernovas/ shards of stars stuck in my lungs” is also a reference to a previous love poem i wrote about him, where i compared the way he made me feel to the intensity of a supernova."
bipolar,ff6k2k9,t3_ervdes,1579628877.0,Lol treated bipolar disorder also lowers your life expectancy. Bipolar it’s self lowers your life expectancy. We all typically get about 10 years less than every body else. So the real question is how do we make up for that?
