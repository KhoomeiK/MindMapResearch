If you buy Mykos, it will increase the root growth and nutrient uptake. To use Mykos, you can poke holes in the soil with your finger until you feel the roots. Then, pour a little teaspoon of the Mycorrhizae into the holes. Fill the holes, and water gently."

GERD,fcfvl1e,t1_fce2asf,1577634159.0,"You’re okay. Don’t blame yourself. These things are accidental. I used to take 30 mg extended release adderall. I took Omeprazole too. Are you worried that mixing these too will make you feel sick? I never had any side effects. I also take ibuprofen because I weight lift. Ibuprofen is only for muscle pain, not heartburn. Be careful how many oats you eat. Although oats are filling, they still give me gas. Maybe you could try Greek yogurt. I eat Chobani Vanilla. It’s super smooth and there is 20 grams of protein per serving. Do not be afraid to take extra Omeprazole if you have a stomach ache. Despite the instructions saying that Omeprazole takes up to 24 hours to kick in, this is false. Omeprazole will start working within 30 minutes. Don’t be worried if you have to take a couple Omeprazole throughout the day. It is only here to help. I recommend staying away from anything called Famotidine. It’s a heartburn medicine that can cause bloody noses and heart palpitations. I used to take Famotidine when I was 19. I could tell it wasn’t working when I was getting nosebleeds and irregular heartbeat pressure. Let me know if you need more advice. I have been fighting this for a couple years now. I will not give up."

Butter on toast. Another idea is homemade cheeseburgers. You can add as many vegetables as you like. Eat as many bananas as you can. Vanilla Greek Yogurt is really good too, I eat Chobani. Let me know if you’d like some more ideas. Try not to worry about what “triggers” heartburn. Concern yourself with taking medication on time, and building an eating routine."
GERD,fcc2cd4,t3_eg69mf,1577593625.0,"Please try to take a medication for heartburn. I would specifically try Omeprazole. You can buy any brand, I get the generic because it is affordable."
GERD,fcc1v62,t3_egejob,1577593470.0,This has to do with the bacteria in your gut. Try taking an enzyme along with Omeprazole. Don’t stop any medications until the heartburn is completely gone.
GERD,fcc1hk6,t3_egriew,1577593345.0,"You need to purchase medication called Omeprazole. You can buy the generic brand to save money. It is just heartburn medicine, but I works the best in my opinion. Do not take tums."
GERD,fcc0p2g,t3_egxuaz,1577593092.0,"I just bought my first digestive enzymes. It is a supplement from a store called Vitamin Shoppe. I recommend looking at their selection of digestive enzymes. You can also try some herbs like licorice. There’s also a supplement called d-limonene that is supposed to help. I just found out about these things last week. I’ve been dealing with GERD for three years. I’ve been taking Omeprazole for two. Some days I have to take 100mgs of Omeprazole. I have zero side effects. I’m 21, male, 215 pounds at 6 feet tall. My biggest concern about my heartburn is that I will never find a cure."
