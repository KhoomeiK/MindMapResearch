awardtravel,ff9p5jh,t1_ff9ntk7,1579717776.0,"I agree that legit frequent flyers have a clear gripe. They pay to fly and aren't being rewarded. 

The question is - who is in charge of the strategies? The credit card companies limiting cards? The airlines to limit redemptions based on paid flights? 

There are solutions, but what's the best way to solve it."
awardtravel,ff9m4pi,t3_esel09,1579715881.0,"They aren't wrong, but I would also say it is a bit disingenuous. It's like saying the banking crisis was ONLY the banks fault. Well, it is the lenders' fault (Airlines), it is the purchasers' fault (churners), it is the markets' fault (credit card companies).  

The airlines want more people in their programs, it makes them look good from a valuation standpoint. The banks want more credit card holders, it makes them look good from a valuation standpoint and MONEY standpoint. The churners want more miles because they want to fly. 

So everyone is getting what they want and everyone got greedy.

So, What's the point of having miles if they can't be used?  Miles holders are getting angry. Churners can't use their miles, and Frequent Fliers don't feel awarded. 

Look at what American did, they started pushing out churners. Is chopping down availability a better way to combat over-churners?"

I'm not hating on the mall, but once you've gone, it just becomes another shopping center. It definitely has its novelty, but that wears off."

projectmanagement,ff2yr4m,t3_erd02a,1579528896.0,"I disagree. A super villain is a charismatic leader, with capable team members to deploy his wishes. But there's often a team member who is behind the scenes coordinating the real necessary efforts. 

Look at it like a film crew. The director is the Super Villain with the grand vision and focused on getting the shot right. The AD is the person that ensures no one bothers the director while the shoot is in progress. By that coordinates the wishes to be deployed if any immediate changes come up. 

The Producer would be like the project manager. They are the ones who need to coordinate the different teams behind the scenes to make sure the shoot is going right. They are the one doing the juggling. 

So there is some ""left hand man"", that coordinates with the ""right hand man"" and the Super Villain to make sure everything goes well. The one who can ensure everything goes as planned. They are behind the scenes and practically unrecognized. They are...project managers."
