If that’s the start to your comment, then we have little to discuss, as you have already made up your mind. Your passion about Star Wars is pretty amazing.

Just to clarify, your position is that even though Luke clearly appeared to have very little idea who obi wan or old Ben was, he was just pretending and had been trained by him his entire adolescent life?  He had heard of the force, but needed significant training from yoda, and appeared to have little to no knowledge of the Jedi ways prior to meeting yoda, from what I’ve seen.

I really think this plot hole must be one of the main reasons why they had to cancel the series, but I’m totally open to contrary arguments.  It seems like quite a stretch to say that Luke had been trained by obi wan and pretended otherwise...especially in a series that began on a precipice of near incest, and George Lucas has not done a very convincing job of explaining that away from what I’ve seen.  Is this really your contention?"

I’m a terminal optimist, and in bouts of excessively terminal optimism, I often say, “Things Could Improve.”

Stay positive, my dude, and listen to more ween.  She doesn’t get to decide how you feel about things ever again, because you decide how you feel.
