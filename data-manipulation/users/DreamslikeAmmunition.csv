LongDistance,ffj2xta,t3_etx431,1579989054.0,"It's not stupid of you to feel hurt by that comment - not because it's true, but because it's an incredibly rude and insensitive thing to say. 

Yes, men enjoy physical contact. But so do women. And Some women and some men don't like to be touched a lot. It's a ridiculous notion to assume that men are incapable of going long periods without physical contact or sex. 

I'm of a Christian background and while I recognize that not everyone abstains from premarital sex, I just don't think it's vital to a dating relationship. Let me be clear - I'm an incredibly touchy person, even more so than my boyfriend. Neither of us are robots who don't want sex. Waiting for marriage is difficult. But...

This whole idea that men are savages and have no control over their sexual habits is bullcrap. Yes, men are more visual, but it's kind of offensive to assume that sex drive is the deciding factor of a man's actions. His CHARACTER is. 

Don't worry about what s/he said. If you and your partner are in a healthy, loving relationship built on trust and mutual respect, then it doesn't matter what s/he says. S/he's most likely wrong. 

Sorry you had to hear that. I can understand why what s/he said bothered you.

If someone you live with is sneakily stealing them, that might work, because it's harder to get away with stealing a whole lock box (or safe). But then again, they could just take the lock box. Do you know who's stealing them? Are they taking the whole bottle or just single pills?

ADHD,ffe84br,t1_ffe4kfd,1579839282.0,"There's gotta be some compromise here. There are different shades of green that aren't neon. I know exactly what you mean bc my boss makes the colors obnoxious and I can't stand it. 

Would it be uncomfortable for you to just take her aside and say ""hey, I don't want to be that person, but I genuinely have a lot of trouble reading the spreadsheet when the colors are so bright - that's why they were so washed out before. I understand we can't use the lightest shade as you need to be able to read it too, but could we pick something in the middle?"" you don't even have to tell her you have adhd.

ENFP,ffd6jla,t3_eswkl5,1579814394.0,"It probably wasn't one sided, but it sounds like he realized he was emotionally cheating when you guys crossed into something that was more easily defined as cheating. If that goes against his moral code (Fi), which I'm assuming it does as infidelity is seen as objectively wrong in most peoples' views, then he's distancing himself. He may still feel that way, but he loves his wife. This is probably my introverted feeling speaking, but his relationship with her and the promises he made to her when he said his vows most definitely trump his relationship with you. 

I understand that it hurts to see someone you care about pull away and I'm definitely not trying to belittle that. It hurts. But it might help you feel a little better to realize that he's just trying to stay true to himself by not compromising the integrity of what he believes in (fidelity and commitment). If he still has feelings for you, he might be trying to *stop* feeling that way because it goes against his beliefs. It seems to me that distance and detachment is the best way to 1. stop his feelings for you and 2. ""make it up to"" his wife (even if she has no idea what was going on.)

As an ENFP, It's not usual for me to go from loving a person to being indifferent toward them, even if I act that way. We are passionate people, but we recognize that feelings do not rule everything. We may feel a certain way, but realize that acting on those feelings is wrong. Whether that be anger, lust, or whatever the emotion may be. 

I'd say give him some space and time. Let him process his feelings and bond with his wife. Maybe you can be best friends again someday, but probably not any time soon. I will admit, it's unlikely - especially if he's come clean to his wife, which he probably has. The guilt would probably consume him and he'd have to tell her. I'm sorry to say that. I hope the best for both of you."
mbtirelationships,ffc96gt,t3_estmt1,1579794398.0,"I'll try to be as concise as possible. 

1. I'm sorry you're feeling suffocated and overwhelmed. You absolutely need to make time for yourself. That is a need, not a want. It's important that you get that time, so even if you have to schedule it out, do it. (I know you said you hate schedules, and so do I, but sometimes you just have to or it won't happen.)
2. You're right when you suggest that breaking up with her may not help her love herself. She needs to seek out counseling if she isn't already. Nothing you do will make her love herself or accept herself. That is something she has to want and it's something she has to work on, preferably with a professional.
3. It sounds like you care for her a lot and it hurts you to see her view herself so poorly. Have you talked to her about this? Obviously don't guilt trip her, but tell her that it's important to you for her to make a reasonable effort to learn how to accept herself. Her happiness is important to you. You appreciate all that she does for you, but she needs to make herself a priority.
4. Related to my previous statement, you both need to make yourselves a priority. Both people in a relationship need to be individuals. I used to subscribe to the  whole ""my other half"" thing, but I don't anymore because a relationship is a team. It requires two autonomous individuals. You need to spend time with yourself and she needs to spend time working through her issues with a professional. It will be better for both of you.

If you haven't already, you should really discuss your concern about her feelings toward herself. Do this in as kind a way as possible. Whether or not you decide to end the relationship, she needs to know your concern for her. I believe you could absolutely work through these issues together, but like all relationships, that is going to take a lot of work. It sounds like you love each other, but you both need to be willing to work to make your relationship the healthiest it can be. If you feel that you cannot see a future with her, you should not stay in a relationship solely for the well being of the other person or to spare their emotions. I'd suggest spending some intentional time alone before you make a decision. Do some more thinking and then discuss your concerns with your partner. 

I wish you luck and hope I could be even just a little helpful.

Your cat peeing outside the litterbox can be a warning sign for many things and none that I can think of are good. Behavioral issues in animals are normally caused by some kind negative external stimuli in the home. And if the cat normally goes in the litter box, it can be a sign your cat is sick when he suddenly starts going outside the box. Contrary to popular belief, cats don't pee on your belongings out of spite. Giving your cat a timeout doesn't actually teach him anything. He most likely doesn't even understand why he's being punished."
ADHD,felvlbu,t3_epujbl,1579232033.0,"I'm a Christian and I have to say, I laughed very hard at the line about your wallet, bc I felt the same way for a long time. Sometimes Christians tend to overlook the practical for the spiritual, but practical solutions are not seperate from God.

To answer your question, therapy has been useful to me already and I've only been diagnosed for about 4 months. Looking into medication as well. Ive learned a lot of good coping mechanisms. Its a lot of work, but its slowly helping. 

My biggest tip is to get a planner or better, use a calendar on your phone and set up a reminder *immediately* once you plan something. Do that for now while you look for a therapist or psychiatrist (if you want meds) who lists adhd as one of their specialties or focuses. If your parents insist on you seeing a Christian counselor, there are Christian counselors who can help too - mine actually is-, but you will have to see your family doctor to be prescribed medicine. Which is what I'm in the process of doing. 

But seriously. If you do one thing in the meantime, it should be to start writing things down and setting reminders. If you're like me, you *will* forget. So write it down!

Best of luck to you!"

I started dating my current bf before we ever met in person. I was worried he might not like me as much when we met in person for the first time because of the same things you're worried about.

antiMLM,fekp3x5,t1_fekdiec,1579204681.0,"""Thieves"" oil existed long before Young Living came along. It's just a blend of clove, lemon, rosemary, cinnamon, and eucalyptus essential oils. It's always been known as 4 thieves oil. 

It got the name because a group of 4 thieves during the Bubonic plague would rob corpses but weren't getting sick. They were former spice merchants who doused themselves in the oil blend and covered their faces while scavenging dead bodies. Most of the reason they didn't catch the plague was probably due to covering their faces. 

There are some essential oils that have antimicrobial properties, including eucalyptus, but these huns act like it's as good or better than bleach. It's simply not. Just because something resists some microorganisms doesn't mean that it resists all types of microorganisms. So, as with a lot of lies, the effectiveness of 4 thieves essential oil is based on an exaggeration of the truth."

Then, there's this stubborn little part of me that wants to do it **even less** than I did before, even though I wasn't *opposed* to it in the beginning, just not necessarily interested. It's not that the person suggesting it has malicious intent or anything like that. I think it's the fact that it's being pushed so hard and that makes me push against it even harder."
jenniferkesse,fee7frr,t3_eoowmz,1579027957.0,"I had wondered the same thing. And in a more recent episode, a search was done in an area close to her job. I think it might have been a lake? I can't remember. It's in one of the most recent episodes. But In that episode, they mention that a seemingly reliable source told them about a neighbor of hers who lived at her condo complex at the time of her disappearance and still lives in the same condo. Allegedly, the neighbor purchased a parcel of land in the same area the search was being conducted. And if I remember correctly, he purchased it relatively shortly after she went missing. It's been a while since I listened to that episode, but I'd been thinking about that and wondering if it was the same neighbor mentioned in the episode you're referring to. 

I've always subscribed to the construction worker theory until that tidbit of info was mentioned. It made me remember what Drew Kesse said about a neighbor knocking on the door in that early episode. I wonder if the person was ruled out somehow?"

antiMLM,fdsocbr,t3_en0des,1578705846.0,"I'm so sorry to hear this. One of my best friends, someone I've known since I was 9 years old, is part of Arbonne and it's ruined our friendship. 

She's in her Aunts downline, but was never super committed to the company. Shes gone down multiple career paths, so i think she just never had a concrete idea of what she wanted to do. She ended up in the military and got married to an airman, but ended up having to honorably discharge because of epilepsy. This is when i think her committment to Arbonne really amped up. She couldnt drive and was confined to the house taking care of her young son. Shes told me that arbonnes products have helped her in her health journey and honestly, i think she thinks that it helps with her epilepsy. But thats false hope. 

The Aunt has been shilling Arbonne since we were 12 (I'm 28 now) and my friend ended up being completely sucked in because she was isolated from friends and family and Arbonne gave her this sense of camaraderie and belonging and a sense of purpose. Shes not a very emotionally intelligent person, and is very opinionated, but she's someone I was once very close with. 

We had a falling out because her negative qualities have amplified since committing fully to Arbonne. I tried to explain about how most of their products were misleading (the fizz sticks are caffeine and citric acid... the skincare has false bottoms, is overpriced, and is deceptive about how *clean* and *pure* it is) But Shes pushy, unwilling to listen and desperate to sell. All she talks about is Arbonne and when I see her together with her hun bot Aunt and cousin - who used to be like family to me - I run the other way. I'm cordial with her and her family, but it's just not the same anymore. I want to tell them the truth about this garbage company, but they won't hear it and are way too far gone.

Your friend is a new recruit and it might not be too late. I would suggest researching MLMs, sending her Arbonne income disclosures, and trying to help her get out of it by being honest. You could save her from lost relationships and financial ruin. I'm so sorry, friend. My heart goes out to you. But I'm glad your boyfriend stopped you from saying yes to something so awful."

I think people jump on the bandwagon of ""natural"" products. Because natural=good and ""chemicals"" =bad. (Even though everything is a chemical, but a lot people don't understand that and just have negative connotations for the word). 

My theory is that because there is actual scientific backing for *some* health uses for essential oils, it makes their wild health claims seemingly credible to people who are unfamiliar to oils. 

MLMs suck. They give essential oils a bad name. None of us who love EOs wants to be associated with YL or DoTerra."
