Awesome website. You can filter based on what part of the world your partner will be from. It’s a great resource for all language learning, not just Portuguese.

Another way is to find local language clubs in your area. Depending where you are it may be harder to find European dialect speakers but many Brazilian Portuguese speakers. I use meetup.com for that. I found a Portuguese club that features dialects of both regions. We usually meet for dinner then people break off into groups for casual conversations. Speakers of all levels welcome.

Oh and a less realistic option for many: study abroad. This required a loooot of research. Schools can get expensive unless you know where to look. I applied directly to Universidade de Lisboa’s intensive language course. It was around 800€ for 5 ish weeks, my dorm was 150€ for that time. If I had gone through a study abroad program through my university it would have been well over $5000.

You could also try to find some kind of host family program... I don’t really know anything about it though but it’s worth looking into."

BipolarSOs,fejctsv,t3_ep5m8q,1579167650.0,"I’m BP1 with a non-BP SO.

I’m so sorry that you and your family are going through this. I encourage you to gently guide him in to seeking further health care if you can, with support from other friends and family. Again, gently. Many patients do not acknowledge their bipolar diagnosis (even if they have recognized it in the past) which further compounds them not wanting to take medicine. Do what you can but the harder you try, it could backfire and feed potential delusional/paranoid thoughts he has. He will come down eventually, we just don’t know when. For him to get better, he has to put in work too. There’s only so much you can do, and by no means should you ever feel guilty for feeling tired, for wanting the problems to go away or to disappear or feeling frustrated with him. You’re going through something very difficult right now.

Protect yourself and protect your family. Your children will remember this and it may help to give you something else to focus on. I wish you the best. Be strong. I’m glad you’ve sought support for yourself and your children. If you can, try to continue creating happy memories for yourself and your kids. You’re not alone in this."

bipolar,feerqyq,t3_eor6d2,1579039806.0,"I ultimately had to change because of that but mainly other side effects (I became a zombie and was so heavily sedated I was late to work all the time and couldn’t concentrate.)

bipolar,feer95u,t3_eork0a,1579039507.0,"For me, staying away from electronics altogether, because light makes things worse, even if it’s decreased blue light. Staying in bed and resisting the urge to check the time, pick up the phone, complete tasks or even to write things down so I wouldn’t forget—“It can wait.” became my mantra.

My psych said that if I was absolutely unable to sleep after a few hours (while avoiding electronics and noise) to get out of bed. She said it was counterintuitive but the brain had to be retrained to associate bed with sleep. I would go to the living room and do some low energy, low concentration activity under dimmed light, NO ELECTRONICS. Then go back to bed and try again. I had to be strict with bedtime/wake-up, even if I felt unrested. No naps.

I haven’t tried blue light specifically for depression or anything. I lived in the PNW for a while where sunset would be about 4PM during winter. I spend time around my indoor plants with full spectrum lights and it may have helped, but I’m not sure."

femalefashionadvice,fdq3oxr,t1_fdpqceq,1578653335.0,"Depends on the shirt ""cut"" as someone else said. Some of my shirts, I tuck middle-ish and side, so I get like 2/3 of the front tucked. It takes some rearranging to keep the shirt from bunching up too much on the side and adjusting the length of the shirt you tuck in.

bayarea,fdphb7a,t3_elmzxi,1578628621.0,"I was with Falck up in Mountlake Terrace, WA. We had mostly IFTs so it was boring but they were good to work for. Pay wasn't the best but we had very low call volume (in WA), like 4-6 calls per 12 hour shift on a typical day up north. Higher call volume south in Fife/Tacoma area. It was very flexible and easy changing shifts, so we had a lot of EMTs that had a second job, had young children, were going to school, etc. It's also easy to pick up OT. 

For the interview be prepared for a couple of questions testing knowledge and skills. It's not gonna be like skills write offs or the NREMT again, just basic skills, CPR, first aid scenario questions. Besides that, there's nothing unique about the interview. They just want to gauge that you're a competent human being who won't do harm to a patient with reasonable level of judgment. Some ""customer service-y"" type and standard interview questions, ""what would you do if x, y, and z were to happen?"" ""What was a scenario where you and a co-worker didn't get along? How did you resolve it?"" ""What would you do if co-worker was doing...?""

No, “I need to do the dishes first,” or “I need to call my doctor’s office to make an appointment.” Just get out that door and go for a walk, or get on your way to the gym/park/trail.

I will say that not everyone experiences the same exact symptoms during their episodes. Like, during my mania I start spending like crazy, getting super social etc but I don’t have the sexual promiscuity for most episodes. Bipolar also tends to start manifesting during your 20s usually, for me hypomania at 22 and first major manic episode at 25.

There could be a number of things influencing your moods besides biochemical causes. I’m no psychologist but things like events during your early developmental stages, familial relationships, other life experiences may have an effect on you. It’ll affect how you process information, react to stressors (both eustress and distress) problem solving, decision making and all that stuff I know nothing about. 

It sounds like whatever is going on is definitely making you unhappy and impeding your ability to live life contentedly. If you have the resources available to you, it might be a good idea to bring up these recent moods, citing specific events, to your primary care doctor or finding a therapist (ideally a trained psychologist). They should be able to refer you out if there is specific care you need.

I hope you find out what’s going on and can work on feeling better and finding happiness. :)"
