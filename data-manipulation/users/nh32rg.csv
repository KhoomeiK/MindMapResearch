cats,ffwqh5f,t1_ffwpwh1,1580308529.0,No worries I have 4 cats and they’re always fighting with hisses and such but then they all curl up together and groom each other and sleep.   As long as they’re not actually hurting each other like drawing blood or taking out several chunks of fur it should be fine. Also in your video the white cat is on its back exposing its belly which if it was a real fight that would never happen.

otr,fdmh5tf,t1_fditbav,1578549750.0,Thanks. Now I can’t sleep. [Porch light](https://archive.org/details/Nightfall-cbcRadioProgram-episodesMp3Format/Nightfall_CBC_82-02-26_14_The_Porch_Light.mp3#)
Patriots,fdkepd9,t3_elv7vc,1578502288.0,Had some good runs but I think the majority of them went for under 2 yards. Didn’t seem to be able to find the holes or wait for them to develop just ran into the pack. That’s fine if you’re Derrick Henry and can push guys around but Michel is not that. Never fumbled though if I remember correctly so gotta give him that.
Patriots,fd7gbdk,t3_ek8x1f,1578204042.0,All we needed was one other reliable receiver not named Edelman. Sanu and Harry were not clutch. They looked like paycheck players.
cats,fcmalh1,t3_ehxr9w,1577768804.0,What a unique cat!
nostalgia,fccd1sh,t1_fcc7s0y,1577597005.0,I gave my nieces a couple of sets for Christmas they were a huge hit. Got them at Walmart.
