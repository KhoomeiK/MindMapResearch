Go to exercise classes that have both sexes (it can take some time (many months) for the other people in the class to bother talking to you because at first you are just a stranger but after you show commitment to the class, they will probably ""take you in"" and try to get to know you, and 2. be a Volunteer (either for politics or, even better, for charitable causes) because you will meet nice people that you can have genuine interactions with (instead of in bars where it's based on alcohol-fueled perceptions), 3. Take self-improvement classes that will help enlarge your abilities/perceptions, and you get to meet other people.

Also, don't have obvious hopes/expectations of romance in every encounter with a desirable woman. It's not a good thing, but women hate desperation and can smell it a mile away. Confidence comes from having women friends because you can become comfortable being around women generally.

MedicalGore,ffzoj3m,t1_ffyif85,1580388079.0,"Man, you can tell you are a nutcase just by the length of this reply with a lot of pro-pitbull links. Sorry, but those of us who live in the US have many, many stories of pitbull attacks in our own cities and have friends and families personally involved. Whether or not a pit bull is more likely to bite than someone's lapdog Chihuahua (that are famous for being nippy and protective of the person whose lap they're sitting on), you are neglecting the main problem of pit bulls. First, they were bred to fight and kill other dogs. That requires aggression. It is bizarre that you would deny that. Second, they don't bite and leave a couple tooth punctures. They grab and hold on with their powerful jaws, and then start shaking, using the weight of their muscular bodies to tear flesh of the bone. Most pit bull attacks require plastic surgery thereafter. It is the method and power of the attacks that are the problem. Other dogs can cause damage, but nothing like pit bull attacks. One problem is that because they are so awful, this makes drug dealers, criminals, wanna-be badasses, and idiots attracted to having them, so there has been a population explosion of them, and are often owned by people who have no business having any kind of dog. They are the number one dog in dog pounds.

If you want to have a breed of dog that factually is responsible for more horrific injuries and deaths than any other breed of dog because you have some savior complex about the ""poor, downtrodden, misunderstood"" pit bull, go for it. Just own it and quit being a puss and making up this bizarre shit about ""nanny dogs,"" and other nonsense to try to change the facts about the breed."
