Pro women soccer is a lot more enjoyable at times, because they do tend to try to play straight more often than not. It may not be as dramatic, but it's less frustrating when all you want to do is watch a solid game"

gifs,fee0zqk,t1_fedu8mm,1579024129.0,"Yeaaa.. our overflow drain in the tub leaked through to the kitchen ceiling below. I unscrewed the overflow drain cover.. only to find that they never pulled the black rubber lining through, so there was absolutely no seal for the water to properly go down the drain. Just dripped directly down onto the floor and eventually through the drywall onto the kitchen floor.

Also, they left a half inch hole in the roof which caused a leak in the top floor ceiling (my room), and a slow drip down through all the windows. VA inspector. (Veteran Affairs)"
