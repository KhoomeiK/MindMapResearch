todayilearned,fg8mzy4,t1_fg7osrh,1580624941.0,"If people actually knew how to use 4-way stops, we wouldn't have to bother with traffic circles."
todayilearned,fg8mtfg,t1_fg7sq6x,1580624746.0,Because our normal right-of-way rules is yield to the driver on the *right* (as at a 4-way stop).   So you have to change your reflexive way of thinking.   That makes people slower to evaluate and respond to what they're supposed to do.
todayilearned,fg8mnun,t1_fg7pbzh,1580624575.0,"Have always had a few in NJ, at least since the 60's, and we always called them traffic circles."
todayilearned,fg8m4t5,t3_exdi9i,1580624010.0,"They suck if you are on a bicycle.   Every turn is a right hook accident or near miss.

I both drive and ride.   Roundabouts annoy me when I'm driving because I don't trust anyone to yield (and sometimes they don't).   They terrify me and and  I avoid them if I can on a bicycle because I can't predict which car is going to right-hook me.   And no, I am not going to ride in the middle of the roundabout pavement with a stream of cars behind me.   Anyone making a minor mistake in that circumstance could mean death.

suggestmeabook,fg8m0qv,t1_fg6hp6u,1580623891.0,Becky Chambers books are pretty good if you can get past the gender soapboxing.
relationship_advice,ffpoesk,t1_ffpbl92,1580100296.0,Hopefully he'll learn something from people's responses here.
HumansBeingBros,ffpnmmb,t1_ffpak25,1580099647.0,"Undoubtedly shoving many women out of the way in the process.   Because that's what happens when there's a group of men and women and something involving lifting heavy objects is involved.

But it's all good, the guys are stronger on average and the pedestrian lived to see another day.   So let's all give the gender wars a rest and just enjoy people being bros."
preppers,ffplvn1,t1_ffpdrht,1580098279.0,Probably because s/he has a really nice bugout place and it's spring.  So why not test it out?
Frugal,ffpjzq3,t1_ffmpni8,1580096880.0,FWIW I basically agree with you even though everyone else seems to be in a high dudgeon.   It's the quality control that the company can afford not the location of origin.   I know what I can expect from McCormick products in general but small asian brands that I have no other info on can be a crapshoot in terms of freshness and contents.  If a friend recommends one to me though then that's additional information and a different story.
sewing,ffedtne,t3_et4l2n,1579844339.0,I love it.  How did you choose the colors?   I like that color combination.
science,ffdw6f2,t3_eswz5j,1579830434.0,"How is ""mass shooting"" defined?    How many total people are killed annually in mass shootings as defined?   (ie in the context of the numbers does this even really matter?)   How would this be reduced if we imposed stiffer penalties on early domestic violence (eg incarceration), which is known to start small and escalate?

It ain't science kids if you start with a conclusion and hunt around for evidence to prop you up."
CatsAreAssholes,ff9vdqo,t1_ff9k8ud,1579722319.0,Well it provoked her.   What can you expect?  :-D

ruger,fe6empi,t3_end9ca,1578888626.0,"I took a look at the Mark IV manual and this sure looks like one of the springs on the diagram.    I'm not sure which model exactly you have (it seems there are a couple of variants), but you could check the manual and probably figure it out.   Exploded parts diagrams start on page 36:

dechonkers,fe6d722,t1_fe6ctb6,1578887481.0,She's beautiful and you are a fantastic owner for getting her healthy and keeping her that way.   It's tough to put cats on a diet especially... and vet visits aren't cheap.
dechonkers,fe6cn4s,t3_enp282,1578887058.0,Did she have fleas?    One of my cats did this and it turned out to be a flea allergy (confirmed by vet).   It took about 6 weeks after starting flea treatment for the dermatitis to go away (and the excessive licking to stop).
AmItheAsshole,fe0li68,t3_endfbx,1578815573.0,"You sound like a self-righteous ungrateful shallow douchebag who spends way too much time watching TV.  Parents love and miss their children. When you get involved with someone you have to compromise on ""ideology"" (which in your case seems to be a conflict about what channel to watch on TV).

YTA.   You don't have to live in a house they buy, or even move back, but you need to grow up and learn how to get along with your SO's parents or at least be tactful.   You need to talk to your SO about their desire to have more contact with her.    They are being quite generous (though possibly wrongheaded) and you need to learn how to say no thank you more graciously.   Claiming the fact that they watch Fox News as an excuse for treating them rudely is very immature.

And why in hell would they outright buy you a house?   9 years and you're not married?      They are no doubt concerned about what happens to that asset if (a) you find another chick and break up with their daughter, or (b) something happens to you.   (If you don't understand the importance of thinking about capital assets, then you don't understand basic financial responsibility and they have even more grounds for not giving you a gigantic gift.)"
assholedesign,fdpb6bu,t1_fdnifnu,1578624263.0,Not giving you more product but less packaging.   They could be saving .1 cents of packaging per package.    The bottles are the biggest cost to the producer... the soap inside is a lot cheaper than those bottles.
assholedesign,fdpb38e,t1_fdnh3wq,1578624205.0,I do exactly the same thing.  In the kitchen I dilute the dish soap with a lot of water for the foaming hand dispenser.   Bacterial growth has never been an issue.   fwiw I never buy antibacterial soaps because they are mostly pointless when not actually harmful.

redditsecurity,fdownzm,t1_fdnuwpz,1578614579.0,"There's US Constitutional free speech which is protected in the US, and then there's reddit's supposed free speech policy.    You are absolutely right that reddit does not support free speech."
redditsecurity,fdowgst,t3_emd7yx,1578614447.0,This seems really very minor in the context of the massive systematic censorship intended to manipulate election-related content that reddit admins themselves engage in.

AmItheAsshole,fdludj0,t3_eluqog,1578532707.0,"NTA.   Keep your SIL as far away from your family as possible.  She's making excuses for an addict and a thief.   Maybe even call the cops and report the theft if you are pissed enough, but discuss that with your wife."
politics,fdb4a83,t1_fd8zh98,1578253600.0,"In your rush to prop up your extremist point of view you miss the large middle: defense has a cost, whether by Obama or Trump, and we are best defended with decisive leadership.   There's real debate to be had but you are not engaging.   You are lazy, sloppy, and self-centered."
