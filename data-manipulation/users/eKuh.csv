berlin,ffq7t3p,t3_eula1v,1580124980.0,"I do not want to defend anyone who actually throws trash on the ground intentionally, but to me it looks like a case of bad ashtray/trash can design (flat top) in combination with a bit of wind?

It's a bit hard to see, but it seems like most of the cigarette buds spread on the ground in a cone shape, originating from the can.

They also look like most of them have been put out by being pressed down, not by being stepped on.

You can see a bunch of buds still on top of the can that will probably fall with the next gust of wind.

Edit:
A comment below informed me that this might not be a smoking area and that there is actually no ashtray on top of the trash can. That would of course invalidate my argument about the bad ashtray design :D"
foodhacks,feh5bb4,t3_ep461u,1579109448.0,"For anyone else who has no idea why candle warmers exist:

Apparently they are used to heat scented candles to extract the smell without the fire hazard and soot that comes with an open flame. 

Sounds pretty obvious, but as someone who has never bought a scented candle, this was quite a surprise.

Highly endorsed, I learned a lot, thank you!

Edit: Huh, now that I think about it, I only checked on imgur, because you specifically recommended it. Do people often annotate their uploads on imgur? how much info have I been missing out on all these years?"
