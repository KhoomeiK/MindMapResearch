For a dog that freaked out at a person, it's far better to quit when you are ahead.  In this case, when she calmed down and sat, that was the end of the interaction.  Getting petted by the neighbor is for another day.

If she's 12 lbs at 12 weeks, I'm guessing she'll get to 15, maybe even 17 lbs at 16 weeks.  That would put her at less than 40 at adulthood.

dogs,ffqvk6h,t3_euagp2,1580144617.0,"Long time collie owner here.

Regarding collies and kids.  We had three collies, Dino, Zeffie and Pablo, when our son was born.  Pablo turned 1 on the day we brought our son home from the hospital and the family lore was Pablo was an exceptionally lucky collie to get his own baby boy for his birthday.  The three were incredibly gentle and careful around our son and obviously considered him precious. 
 
So yes, collies can be awesome family dogs but to be honest, a lot depends on the family - the people's temperaments & how they react to the world.

Here's one of the [best write-ups on collies](https://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/collies.html).  In fact that website has IMHO very honest and fair write-ups on all sorts of breeds.  

The part about emotional sensitivity is a key factor in how well a collie fits into a family.  My SO, son and I are all mild, easy-going, upbeat introverts and we joke that we are collies in human form.  Even so I've also known content collies in homes of extroverts but they are easy-going and stable.  

What collies can't handle is anger, yelling, arguments and toxicity.  They get convinced they did something terribly terribly wrong to cause it and it just kills them inside. That can also trigger future anxiety in that the collie gets worried he'll mess up again.  Collies in those situations tend to either shut down (get hesitant and sad) or get neurotic (barking & overwhelming anxiety)   

That said, with kid crying, collies are sweet.  If our son cried at all, Zeffie came running to me (""COME NOW!"") while Dino and Pablo stayed with our son.  They all were collies in touch with their inner Lassie.  ;-)  If a kid is sad or has been corrected, collies are stricken (but not the soul shattering level of family anger) and I've always thought [this old Victorian painting (of a child who was put in time-out)](https://imgur.com/a/n78wXEU) pretty well captured the typical collie response.  Often after giving the parent the disbelieving ""how could you"" look,  the collie would go to the kid and push her head under an arm.  

And finally the main criticism of collies is barking.  Collies are a naturally vocal breed but, being highly trainable and biddable, they can certainly learn to be quiet.  Of the collies we've gotten as pups, they have all been quiet - quiet enough to live anywhere, go anywhere and everyone is happy.  The important thing to remember is that barking can become a habit, an ingrained one, and once is does, it's a huge problem.  We've owned two collies which came as older pup / young adult with already ingrained barking habits and a that point, there was no compete cure but training to mitigate the barking along with a heaping dose of management.  I love collies but never want to adopt another with a ingrained barking habit again. 

The key is to never let the barking habit start.  From the moment a baby collie comes into our home, we interrupt and distract any barks.  This is all done low-key and calmly.  Never yell, never scold. Just mild discouragement.   And remember Puppy Barking is Not Cute.  It Is Never Cute. Preventing a barking problem is honestly pretty easy and the benefits profound.   Oh, and never ever stick a collie outside alone and leave it - it's a pretty surefire way to start a barking habit. Partly because collies would rather be inside with their people than anywhere else and partly squirrels, enough said."

>when passing other dogs on our way in and out of our building, he gets cautious and walks a bit closer to us, but if the other dog lunges or barks at him then he will let out a growl or bark as a reaction 

IMHO, he's not showing inappropriate behavior at all.   His response is defensive.  Of course he's walking closer to you.  He's scared and if a Dachshund cross, isn't very big.  He's still trying to get a grip on what's happening and just can't deal with other dogs right now.  Growling or barking is the only way he knows to tell the other dogs to give him space.  By allowing other dogs to do this to him, he feels like he has to defend himself because he has no idea if you will protect him.  

>he is quite scared when a new person comes into our place (sometimes he shakes quite a bit) and takes a couple of hours to let them pet or get close to him

Part of the protocol is to seriously limit visitors, ideally none during this period.  If the dog is showing fear (which your dog is clearly doing)  visitors need to completely ignore him.  By persisting in making contact just stressed out the dog even more.  He feels pressure and no one is helping him.  

>he is pretty terrified of fast traffic when we are walking on a busier street. Today it stressed him out for awhile afterwards.

As /u/solasaloo mentioned, your dog should go out for bathroom and then back inside.  He's showing you that he just can't handle traffic, it's just too much.  

>This is also at least the 4th place he has moved to in the last month, including his trip from California to the rescue society here in Vancouver.

Sprint races are much shorter  from 4 to 25 miles.  For sprint racing breeders experimented with greyhounds but they didn't work well at all for multiple reasons, including their lack of endurance, temperament and lack of instinct.

When pups bond overly tightly, as is the basic issue with littermate syndrome, all emotions tend to be extra intense. What can often happen is that one will be the bold one, one the timid one.  Two halves of a whole. Neither a separate whole individual.  They can get to the point that they freak out if separated.  Imagine if one has to go to the vet or to be groomed or for any reason has to leave for even a few hours and the other goes into a panic attack.  Imagine if one dies?  

Alternately with these intense emotions, if there's any animosity, it can trigger some serious aggression - fights with real injuries.

To raise two pups and prevent littermate syndrome means keeping them separate nearly all the time.  Sleep apart, eat apart, trained apart.  They can have set playtimes but otherwise live separate lives.  Which pretty much negates the reason you are thinking of getting a second pup.  And think about it, to do it right means one pup will be isolated - away from you and the family half his puppyhood.

Edit: the greatest gift we can give a pup is our attention and guidance to become the best dog possible.  For him to see you as an awesome partner to go out and learn about the world.  Getting a second pup is you passing off that interaction, giving it away to the 2nd pup.  It's extremely difficult for a pup to take two pups out into the world, especially two Akita pups,  and so your first pup's world will be even smaller, just him and the other pup."

In those cases, a common complaint is that the owner can take the dog for long walks and yet when the dog comes inside, as soon as they can, they sneak off to poop.  

For those cases, I've found that an extendable leash in a grassy area can be helpful to allow the dog some space.  Even better if there's bushes or the like that the dog can go behind.  It really helps if the owner turns away so the dog doesn't feel like under the spotlight and keep tract of the dogs actions with his side vision."

TinyHouses,ff9n61t,t1_ff9jyen,1579716496.0,"I've pondered Murphy beds or other solutions.  

I've thought about a [pulley system](https://imgur.com/a/niKrhp7) to raise or lower the bed but the examples I've seen on line just look too fragile.  Even if the thin rope is actually strong enough, psychologically it would bother me.  And they would swing.

When looking up the pulley type bed I found a version which has the bed on rails pulled up by a pulley.  It would open up space and not swing around.  This one is a [pulley with rails](https://imgur.com/a/YePPwYw) and this one [a motor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEurdaURavw).  Because I'm paranoid, I'd want some sort of mechanical blocks in place on the rails to prevent even the chance of it going down on its own.

When I look at murphy beds, I think it'd be hard to keep the sheets, cover, and pillows in place.  With a bed that can be raised and lowered, that's not an issue."

TinyHouses,ff9f8he,t3_esbk7d,1579711742.0,"The ""transparent bathroom"" gets a hard no from me. If I had that place, that glass would get window film on it ASAP.  Maybe full opaque for the bottom 4/5ths and semi-opaque from there to ceiling. But clear glass?  Hell to the no.  

I'm most  curious about that itty bitty washing machine. I've never seen anything like that before.

The kitchen looks fine.  

I like the number of windows as it lets in a lot of light.  I'm guessing they have sliding shades.  

I dislike that all the windows look unable to be opened. That means if it's at all warm & sunny, it HAS to have AC and if there's no power or the AC breaks, it's basically a solar oven. Besides I like to have the option to have air from the outside flowing in.  No matter what I want the ability to get fresh air.  And I want screens on all windows.  

I can imagine maybe  the reasoning for ""earthquake resistant"" is that 1) it's not structurally part of the ground with a foundation.  An earthquake could rattle and shake it but it wouldn't twist or tear the building apart.  And 2) that it's made fairly robustly.  A mobile home is also not anchored to the ground and thus during an earthquake would not be torn and twisted like a house with foundation but most of them are barely nailed together and I think with a strong earthquake could be bounced to pieces.  So maybe this cube can bounce about and still stays whole?  

Another of my bugaboos about tiny home design is the near inevitable non-ergonomic sofa/lounge seating. So many are like this - a pad on top of a flat surface with token pillows that even if bunched together would still not likely to be comfortable.   There's a reason that sofas and comfy chars have the seat sloping back and with an angled, and well cushioned back.  They are made to conform and work with the human body.   

When not used for sleeping, beds are a huge floor space hog.  One way to get around it in many tiny homes is to put the bed up on a loft.  Maybe this place could be made slightly taller so that the bed could be elevated, resulting in being able to use more of the floor?

Anyway, my random thoughts.  Again, the thing that intrigues me the most is that eensy washing machine."
Dogtraining,ff9bkm7,t3_escj4m,1579709227.0,"This is a self-rewarding behavior - both the food and the gamble (he never knows if he's going to get a huge payoff)  

The best option is for a dog to never learn that there is something like counter surfing and thus never develop the habit.  

Once a self-rewarding behavior has gotten into place and especially if it has resulted in some awesome rewards, the desire to do it will always be in place and, yes,  it's all about management.  

Punishment will result in evasive behavior.  For example, if a kid likes to go out partying with this friends.  His parents don't like this and they yell or ground him or take away his car keye.  The kid still wants to party and now will just be more sneaky about it.  Be sneaky enough his parents won't know or won't know the extent of it. 

It's *sometimes* possible to stop a rewarding behavior with super strong punishment but that has to be done very very carefully and can backfire big time.  And for some dogs, even that won't stop them.  For example, there's scat mats - an electrified mat placed where you don't want the dog to go.  For some dogs, that's enough to make them stop.  However some dogs will be so freaked out that they will develop fear and superstitious behavior.  Fear of the room or of something that happened at the time (if it was raining out side for example) or generalized anxiety.  Alternately if the desire is still strong enough, there's dogs that will study the situation and figure out how to get around the scat mat in some way.   In particular, the downside to having a scat mat on the floor is that it can zap a human and thus the human needs to always remember to turn it off or move it.  A clever dog would be watching for his opportunity.     

Positive training could hypothetically work only if the reward was far far better than the self-rewarding behavior but in RL, there's often nothing that good.   There's no treat, no toy, no anything that would be more rewarding to a Terrier then chasing small critters. 

And so it's management, blocking off the room and keeping all food off the counters or tables."

Dogtraining,ff92tuy,t1_ff7k2s7,1579703469.0,"> I always put the crate in a quiet room.

Funny thing is that I always do the opposite.  Maybe it's a collie thing maybe it's a show/performance dog thing because that's been our MO for many years.  

Collies babies tend to come with a previous introduction to crates so that's a head start.  What they hate is to be isolated and separated from their people.  Put a collie in a quiet room, away from their people is the best way to make them upset and trigger some hard core barking.  

>I imagine if I crated my dog in a high-traffic area, even my quiet-as-a-ghost dog would bark too. All the movement and sound, the FOMO, is winding him up and distressing him.

As well, go to any dog show or trials, an exciting place with a lot of dogs,  and you'll see many many dogs hanging out in their crates dozing or watching the action.  A dog barking his fool head off in a crate is actually not very common. Except in flyball but that's kind of nuts anyway.  And some agility competitors who allowed barking - not just in the crates but as the dog works.  

It's remarkable how, overall, it's quiet it can be at a show/trial.   The crates often have a towel/sheet on top and draped down 2 or 3 sides but that's partly to make the top into a table like surface and that it's nice for the dog  to not be exposed on all sides.  But to cover all sides would be, honestly, unfair to the dog.  I've put my collie's crates alongside high traffic areas and in view of the action and they just settle back and watch the parade.  

Having a dog on a tether or leash at a show or trial tends to actually winds them up and agitates them.  

When I've needed to have a collie crated at home (Alfie doesn't need it anymore), I have crates in all the places people are. Being with their people is all that matters.  Knowing that their people are elsewhere makes makes the human returning into a bigger deal than it needs to be."

dogs,ff7vpwx,t1_ff7n886,1579659488.0,"Starting in the '60s, there's been talk of making the Cockapoo a breed and no, it's never gone anywhere.  To make the Cockapoo into a real breed means a huge number of foundation dogs (in the several thousands in order to prevent inbreeding issues), coordinated effort by many many breeders and finally strict criteria and culling (removing from the gene pool and breeding consideration) offspring that do not fit into the ""Cockapoo"" type.  

It's easy to make a new breed when there's one recessive gene involved - such as going from the Whippet to the Long haired Whippet (long haired gene supplied by a Sheltie) which was then refined into the Silken Windhound.  They didn't have to worry about having a very large  foundation gene pool as it was no problem to cross regular whippets with LHW/Silken Windhounds and still maintain  LHW/SWH breed type.  

Puggles and the various ""doodles"" have the same issues as the Cockapoo.  The ""classic"" Cockapoo, Puggle, Labradoodle, Goldendoodle and so on are F1 crosses produced from crossing one purebred to another purebred. The results of each cross (Pug x Beagle or Lab x Poodle) is predictable.   Cross F1s though and all predictability goes out the window.  

When working with such dramatically different types such as Pug vs Beagle, it takes a lot of crossing and a lot of culling to get a population that will breed true.  In many litters only a few will fit the new breed type and most will need to be removed from breeding consideration.   That was the downfall of any attempt to create a Cockapoo breed, it's a lot of work, effort and discarded dogs when it's just easier to keep doing F1 crosses.   

The only real progress being done with Doodles is down in Australia where they are trying to standardize it and it's still having  a lot of trouble.  They are now crossing in cockers.   In the US?  Just a few kennels and what I've seen is that they'll give it a try and then fizzle out."
McMansionHell,ff7e64c,t3_erxdpx,1579647475.0,"IMHO, there's some  components of McMansions that are key for me: wastefulness, poor design - setting the house up for failure and oversized ego. 

First off,  A foursquare or craftsman or ranch were all made for the average family and were affordable for average families.  The design choices were largely utilitarian.  Yes, within a style, but still the goal was a useful, secure place.  

You had rooms for different activities - bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room, perhaps a family room or den or playroom.  Typically a family lived there and all the rooms were likely utilized.

A McMansion is generally greatly oversize with all spaces exploded in dimensions.  Rooms and structures are made in ways that they *can't* not be wasteful.  High ceilings make a place hard to heat, tons of hard-scaping creating heat islands, walls of fixed windows requiring AC to be livable.  One can live wealthy or frugal in a craftsman or ranch but one can't live poor in a McMansion.  

If there's a design choice, McMansion architects tend to choose the most wasteful option and the one that is at greatest risk for failure.  My bugaboo is roofs.  Here's a [McMansion](https://imgur.com/a/1jA16Nl) from McMansion Hell.  The peaks/roof lines of that house are way way high and the top is over twice the height of the house below it.  To create a huge roof like that takes a lot more resources and engineering that doesn't give back in living space or anything useful.  It's an insanely tall roof just to have an insanely tall roof.    

Water is the biggest danger to a home and the roof is the umbrella to protect it.  McMansion roofs are created so complex that there's typically many points of potential failure.  In fact, many are a guarantee to fail.  

Roof replacement and repairs are expensive no matter what.  Fixing or replacing a roof on a ranch, with it's simple design and low pitch is the easiest and most economical.  You don't need to be an engineer to figure how to do it or any flashing, nor is there much danger.  McMansion roofs are typically extremely high pitched with a lot of complex, bizarre unions and valleys.  You actually need people who understand roof design and water flow to correctly figure out repairs and flashing errors.  With those steep pitches, the price ratchets up rapidly for anyone to work on them.  

Anyway, that's some of my thoughts on McMansions."
