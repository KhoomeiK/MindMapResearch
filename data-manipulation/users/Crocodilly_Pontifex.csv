WhitePeopleTwitter,ffi6y62,t1_ffi5bs7,1579966712.0,Are we suddenly debating whether sales taxes are regressive or not? Is this even a question?
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffhyfjm,t1_ffhx7ed,1579959236.0,"Nothing you said is false, but it could be misleading in the conclusions it leads people to.

Yes, each state is separate, but there *is* a federal government and it unites the separate states. Cities and states have the power to levy their own taxes, but they aren't *required* to issue sales taxes.

They could, for example, choose to tax income, property, or capital gains. Then taxes wouldn't be a factor in prices on the shelf.

The fact is, the reason prices don't include taxes is because there's no law saying companies have to do so, and since it's not required, they're not going to do the extra work.

Price labels are printed at the store, and it's not like this stuff changes daily. If they wanted to, they could.

I totally agree with you about it being just another way to stick it to the poor."

TwoXChromosomes,ff73vp8,t3_ervyqi,1579640599.0,"You don't understand. They're fine with abortion. *Especially*  their own abortions. They want poor women to be financially dependent and easy to control. Look at it as a whole:

1.) These groups also minimize the damage of domestic violence. They try to lessen the perceived severity of domestic accuse related crimes.

2.) They pass laws that are very unfriendly to people getting abortions, or outright hostile to them, if they can. Make sure that women can't get an abortion without telling the father. Try to require both to consent when possible so as to take even more power away. Require a trans vaginal ultrasound, so you can force women to let someone shove a dick sized piece of plastic inside their body, as a further deterrent. Nobody *likes* a procedure that invasive, but this is especially affecting for women with sexual trauma in their past. (So, most women)

3.) They pass very anti-family labor laws so that, as a mom with kids, you're encouraged to shack up, settle down, and get married. 

4.) They minimize the importance of rape, especially in a marriage. 

5.) Heavily stigmatize not having children. Deify the role of mother in society. Stigmatize staying single

Help me understand how, of all the available options, this seemed like the best one?

You could have: 

1.) Stayed out if it and provided loving support to the kiddo afterward.
2.) Talked to other friends and family members and tried to get them involved to change the parent's minds.
3.) If you really feared for the child's well-being, you could have called social services and gotten them involved. They wouldn't remove him from the home. They would most likely do an interview and refund a good counselor to help the family thru this rough patch, not to mention making the point abundantly clear that humiliation is not an effective parenting technique. It would have carried extra weight with the parents, and it would have been less disruptive.

And before you say ""that seems extreme,"" I want you to consider that this is about 200% likely to happen *now,* as a result of what you *did* do.

INSTEAD

You told a 12 year old with behavior problems ""your parents are about to betray your trust and humiliate you, but don't worry, because I'll completely undermine them because I think they're wrong. Why don't you take some time to figure out how best to emotionally manipulate them? Aaaaand, GO!""

TO A 12 YEAR OLD.

You act like this was an unforseen consequence. Have you ever met a 12 year old? Healthy ones are literally incapable of accurately predicting consequences of their actions, and they're *baaaarely* more empathetic than Ted Bundy.

What in the fuck did you *think* was going to happen?

You need to come clean and tell Mom and Dad what you did. If you don't, the doctors who see the kid are going to be acting from bad assumptions; i.e. that he came up with a death threat against his *parents* cold and extemporaneously. That's a *real* different diagnosis than if he came up with it after his fuckwit Uncle told him to do it.
