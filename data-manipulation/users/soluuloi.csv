Coronavirus,ffmvqgy,t1_ffmts11,1580059419.0,"Just wear a mask, avoid direct contact, dont sneeze/get sneezed at, wash your hands whenever you can, and tell the doctor your symptoms. It's NOT that the virus is easy to spread, it's that you MAY have been infected without knowing. Now that you know the basic steps to avoid getting infected, it should be much HARDER to be infected because the virus is not that lethal (yet).

Also, in the best scenario, you still know why you have nose bleeding."
