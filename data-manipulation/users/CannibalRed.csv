fo76,ffod0ul,t3_eu4na8,1580076431.0,"Agreed the main problem isn’t dmg, it’s that the perks require too much of a spread between skill trees to make it viable. Rifles and melee (the best builds are basically all nicely fit to one or two trees. Pistols aren’t. If Beth just moved some perks to make it fit better and pistols could be fun."
MonsterHunter,ffgy8pf,t1_ffgxelx,1579918139.0,Thanks. Hero King Coin.
MonsterHunter,ffgwdlz,t3_etitif,1579916752.0,"For a Lance, this fight is a godsend. I’m currently grinding Barrioth for the event and holy crap that dude is constantly jumping away. Aggressive monsters mean constant fighting and lots of counters, perfect for Lance. I’ll take an aggressive monster over a passive one anyday. It all depends on your weapon. Sorry Stygian isn’t for you, but he’s freaking fantastic for some others. Just like I’m sure some fast weapons enjoy Barioth even though he’s the bane of my existence.

Oh I also play Glaive and he’s a pretty fun/easy fight with that as well. Maybe Duel Blades just aren’t as suited for the fight."

pokemon,feud10d,t3_eqjcaz,1579385367.0,Unpopular opinion but I was always super disappointed by Blaziken. I had dreams of an epic fire rooster and got... whatever the nuts that thing is. Got super excited for Emboar when he was announced as well. Dreaming of an ancient boar with bellows of flame erupting from his mouth as he charged with giant tusks... but then I got a wrestler. And then the same thing again with Litten. Delphox is the only fire starter I’m ok with being bipedal but only because we already have Ninetails and coincidently is the only fire starter I’ve ever chosen to play through a Pokémon game with.
Overwatch,fecfrmy,t1_fecf2ag,1578972854.0,Lol ur totally right. Sorry saw a very similar clip early from a Keph stream. That’ll teach me to not pay attention lol. Mb
Overwatch,fec6tqe,t1_fe9dvbp,1578967638.0,"You’re watching two top 500s in this clip. The stand and let them walk into it doesn’t work at that rank. Each player is doing more than just taking pop shots here. They’re trying to predict the other person. It looks almost stupid to the viewer but I can assure you it’s not. Btw that widow is Kephrii, you should check his stream or YouTube. Dude is legit amazing. Played in the pros in Korea for a season as well."
ForTheKing,febfil9,t1_febee83,1578958257.0,"Yeah the no chaos factor in Frost made it a lot more of a chill experience. My only complaint with the mode is that the world is a littler smaller than I’d like. On more large landmass or biom  been appreciated as my world only had 2 (idk if that’s normal).

Thanks for responding about the wiki. Anything you add to it will be very appreciated by new players."
ForTheKing,feaxisj,t3_eob7w1,1578953231.0,"I ran sword shield Blacksmith, spear shield Trapper and Scholar. Not exactly a meta team and it wasn’t easy, but I got it done with what I’m pretty sure is underleveled gear and at only lvl 10. Oh but it was on Apprentice mode cus you know, first timer and all.

Now that I feel a little invested in the community, can I ask why the Wiki for For the King is such trash? There’s just the bear minimum of info on there and tons of totally blank pages. With the knowledge you have combined on this sub I’m sure y’all could fill the gaps for the wiki. I’m sure it’d help those FTK players that don’t use Reddit."
ForTheKing,fe5u8x6,t1_fe5u43c,1578875067.0,Thanks for the info :) Now we can use less Lore and maximize our game.
science,fdsblwq,t1_fdr3n9c,1578698864.0,"Look like you got a bit of hate friend, so I came to say I grew up with guns and my parents taught me how and when it’s appropriate to use them. I felt safe knowing I could lock myself in my parents room and protect myself in an emergency. Oh and I live in Texas so maybe there’s some more fuel on the fire for haters. 3 children grew up in that house with guns (out of their reach until they took gun safety courses and had range practice) and no one shot each other or themselves.

But still, it does happen. My family took guns and education seriously. Not all families do. And not all kids are as mentally stable as we are. I’m sure if my parents felt we were unstable the guns would’ve disappeared. Still for some I guess that might be too late. It’s a complicated issue like pretty much everything else. The black and white opinions of Reddit are as ignorant of each other as ever. Personally experiences shouldn’t be downvoted. They hold more weight than options. Wether they come from a good experience or a bad one."
todayilearned,fdmcjpo,t1_fdmbupx,1578545585.0,"So then the bailouts were loans from the federal government with no strings attached? It’s just money exchanging hands? Or is it more complicated? Was the government also taking on a responsibility to support the company in other ways or simply support them monetarily?

I know it’s a lot of questions and I probably just need to look into it myself. Might as well try to educate myself here with whatever knowledge people want to offer though."
todayilearned,fdmbq71,t1_fdmbaso,1578544908.0,"Thanks for the response but I’m aware of the “why” of the bailout (and make no judgments or assumptions as to wether this was the right or wrong decision). I’m wondering the repercussions and how it may have or may not have an effect on government involvement with competitors of companies bailed out. It wasn’t just a “have some money and good luck thing” I assume. What responsibility does the government have to GM in keeping them afloat during/after the recession, and could it effect support for their competition and alternate forms of transportation or green projects?"
todayilearned,fdm8jry,t3_elxxzn,1578542461.0,"Question, (and I’m not knowledgeable on the subject so don’t ram it too far up my backside) but with GM’s bailout in the 2000’s didn’t the government dig themselves a deeper hole into GM’s pocket? If they support projects like said rail, aren’t they working against the interest of a company they bailed out? Is there some sort of relationship between the government and the company that they bailed out that would make it more difficult for government support of their competition?

I’m imagining a sort of “we bailed you out a decade ago because we couldn’t risk losing you then, but now we are helping your direct competition and potentially destroying you”. Or is it more like there’s so much government investment in GM that they would never support the rail? You know like how everyone assumes/knows that many politicians are so involved with or dependent upon support from the oil industry that they throw down every green energy solution they can. Anyone know what the actual inner workings and repercussions of the GM bailout were? Sorry if I’m a bit off the opringal posts topic."
borderlands3,fdcnc6z,t1_fdcn7br,1578279186.0,That’s smart. I messed with a lot of Tediore before lvl 50 and enjoyed them. If I find a solid legendary Tediore I’ll keep it in mind for Phoenix farming. Thanks.
borderlands3,fdcfwcr,t1_fdcetyt,1578273900.0,That’s very kind of you friend. I don’t mind farming my own tho. If Graveward has about the same chance of dropping a Deathless and is a faster farm then I’ll just head over and vent my anger on the big guy.
science,fbndvsj,t3_ee0bpw,1576996252.0,Can r/science stop with the posts about studies that proof obvious things people already know. This place is like a feeding ground for getting likes for pointing out the obvious. Already unsubbed to r/psychology for this. How about posting studies that break expectations instead?
