There are some special diets in which there is a *viable medical reason* that it cannot be broken, such as meat allergies, Celiacs, etc. Veganism does not fall under that at all, vegans will not encounter medical issues after consuming animal products.

I'm a vegetarian because I just don't enjoy eating meat. I ate bone broth by accident the other day because the host of the dinner party didn't let me know, and being a socially mature human I *did not* start screaming and throwing shit on the ground."

bikers are the most stuck up, pretentious assholes. seriously wtf mate, you have an entire ass bike lane to yourself, which first of all is still annoying since there are absolutely *zero* bikers that actually use it... but also, not following traffic laws, swerving in the middle of the road like fuck off mate it's a 35mph road, if you're not doing that or a bit over get tf off the road since you're holding us up

and then they get pissed when drivers complain like wtf mate why do you think we hate you? fucking pests. the sidewalk is perfectly fine, or if you're going to go on the road, do it in the bike lane or go the speed limit."

Rey’s usage of the force seems shoehorned in, her ability to fucking yeet Ben solo in TFA with absolutely zero lightsaber training is bs. And it’s explained by the movie as “well she’s badass so duh.” Rose/Finn was completely unnecessary.

Whereas in mandalorian they 100% had an idea where to go. Where there filler episodes? Sure, but everything wrapped up perfectly in the last episodes and those “filler” episodes serve a purpose in the grand scheme."

However with the new sequel trilogy and TROS specifically the entire saga turns into the story of Palpatine and it’s 1. Disrespectful to George and 2. Just badly written. It’s a retcon to make the entire 9 movies about Palpatine since that’s never what it was meant to be anyways."
