They literally covered up the research and then began a tremendous disinformation campaign because they were so ass-blasted about the fact they would get blamed for it. Capitalists lazily doing what they should have done decades ago is the lowest form of defense. Capitalism allows us absolutely staggering capabilities for production, when will we *all* be able to enjoy the full products of our, yes, *collective* labor? Quit regurgitating talking points and critically examine this mode of production and the ecological disaster it's brought upon us."

I also find it interesting how you keep claiming ""every socialist country"" has failed and yet, like I mentioned earlier, Cuba, Rojava, and the Zapatistas are doing just fine.

""Repeating the same mistakes"" is how capitalism has continued to cause economic disasters time after time. No one is advocating for a centrally planned economy anymore. Leftist theory is extremely critical of the early socialist experiments and being ignorant of that is not a valid reason for dismissing everything altogether."

If you want to say that wealth taxes are difficult to implement, well I don't know how you got there from here but sure I'd probably agree. But you're completely misrepresenting policy, no one advocates for 10% of all wealth be taxed. What has been advocated is a 2% (sometimes 3%) tax on every dollar of wealth after $10m ($32m for Bernie's plan). This would affect a miniscule percentage of the US population and still [potentially] generate billions of dollars in new taxes. Not to mention, it would in no way eliminate billionaires and they would continue being ultra wealthy. They'd just finally be contributing their fair share."
