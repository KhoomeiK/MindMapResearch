worldnews,ffaxdhp,t1_ffasde8,1579746691.0,"Not really true by any stretch. Never observed only means that we have never seen it in people or in the few studies that look into ancient viruses. But our bodies have been in the business of hunting for viruses for much, much longer.

This kind of comes down to just how 'never observed' these things are. Are they never observed in the sense of being new serotypes of known viruses or are they entirely new type of viruses (having a unique glycoprotein capsid arrangment or mechanism to establishing infection within a cell). Essentially, what can we relate them most to of what we have observed?

This will determine whether or not they will be loose cannons that we aren't prepared for or if they are simply walking into a gunfight with a butter knife. There are certain 'motifs' or patterns that our body can recognize as being clearly viral - be they composed of protein or carbohydrate or nucleic acid or lipid. 

It's just kind of a convenience of nature that certain lineages stick to certain tricks. Once they have set into a certain host system then these tricks evolve in complexity but seldom do they make dramatic jumps in the core aspect of their composition. It's possible many of these viruses that had never been observed before might have 
not had enough time to put hats on their hats enough to disguise themselves from our immune systems in the same way that modern strains of the flu are constantly shifting around new permutations of their H & N moieties as well as creating new forms through random genetic events.

And all this supposing they are even capable of being pathogenic to humans. None of this is specified in the article - and most viruses are not dangerous to humans. The diversity of viruses is so staggering and we only know of so few that actually affect us."

""It will not be amiss to distinguish the three kinds and, as it were, grades of ambition in mankind. The first is of those who desire to extend their own power in their native country, a vulgar and degenerate kind. The second is of those who labor to extend the power and dominion of their country among men. This certainly has more dignity, though not less covetousness. But if a man endeavor to establish and extend the power and dominion of the human race itself over the universe, his ambition (if ambition it can be called) is without doubt both a more wholesome and a more noble thing than the other two. **Now the empire of man over things depends wholly on the arts and sciences.

And frankly is the existence of a being at our level of intelligence even truly significant in any way at the scale of life's existence? We're little more than a fresh new experiment that's gotten a bit out of hand - nothing really special on a strictly genetic level.

It's not just the people building the pyramids which is a staggeringly difficult and complex operation requiring off-site quarrying of exceptional precision, specialized transportation systems for such enormous cargo, and a purpose-build dock for reception of the materials. But let's think about the auxiliaries here. An entire city built on the spot to sustain and accommodate a ridiculously huge building project. You need housing, you need food depots, you need camel-handlers, security thugs, and payroll people. There has to be entertainment for your drones when they aren't toiling. People to transport goods and people in and out of the place without mucking up your specialized transportation of building goods. All this stuff going on and you're communicating with runners passing notes and people haven't quite gone for the two-ledger accounting system yet.

science,ff4rnds,t1_ff4j7sa,1579570795.0,"So, have you ever asked yourself why a pronghorn antelope is so fucking fast? They are running at like 75mph and the only thing not running on an engine that's getting near them is a puma with a hot 50mph in a sprint. But that's still 50% slower than the pronghorn. Bears are a cantankerous 30mph while wolves can be springy enough to bump 40mph in a short burst. What makes those silly track and field deer go so fast?

It's because there were once cheetahs in North America. And not only that, it's actually where the cheetah first evolved. A common ancestor of the cheetah, cougar and the jaguarundi (but not jaguar) crossed into America over the Bering Land Bridge where they then diverged into separate species. The cheetah made its way its way back to Asia and from there to Africa.

During the Late Pleistocene Extinction Event, cheetahs hit a population bottleneck - they die out in North America, their numbers are severely impacted in, completely gone in Europe. Only in Africa do they persist. Which strikes this really bizarre contradiction compared to the fact that most megafaunal extinctions are sort of creeping out of Africa with the expansion of human population out of it. It's almost like they got grandfathered in on the relative stability of an environment already being messed with by people.

The cougar also has a somewhat interesting evolutionary history in this regard. It came with the cheetah along for the ride when its common ancestor made its way to America. But unlike the cheetah, it was a primary participant in the Great American Interchange of the Cenozoic era. Cougars very successfully colonized South America. But wouldn't ya know it, the cougars of North America are pretty much entirely extirpated around the same time as their American cheetah compatriots. Luckily enough, the cougars of South America just edged their way back in to repopulate North America once things had sort of mellowed out and all the bodies had hit the floor of the mass extinction."

science,fepmnbu,t1_fen22ga,1579324555.0,"I think trying to look into the eyes of your dog and understand exactly what the world looks like through their mind is equally unfathomable as looking into the eyes of any other human being any understanding what it is they must be seeing and thinking at that moment. The subjective experience of human-to-human is kinda alien if you get really deep into.

Think about the last person that you talked to face-to-face. Try flipping the tables of your visual memory of that moment. What do you think they saw past your head during that conversation? What do they remember of it in their minds eye? Were they color-blind? Can you think of what the place you were in would have looked like if you were color-blind?

But Judaism went through a really transformative phase in the wake of the First Roman-Jewish War, destruction of the Second Temple, and the mass eviction of Jews from Judea. Due to the fact many Jews were no longer able to access the places their religious rites had been centered on, a more mobile for of spirituality was born and Jews retained a pretty big deal of ethnic identity wherever they ended up among the diaspora due to the stringency of their cultural-religious practices. This left them as frequently being the 'others' among their fellow countrymen and thus the person who was an easy target for exploitation in many ways. But to justify exploiting someone it was often tactful to make them out to be the villains - thus the need to make Jews seem bad.

I mean, going even further back before the diaspora begun - the whole root of the Roman-Jewish Wars was that the Jews would not compromise to Roman demands for imperial diety worship. The Jews historically take their right to their religion really seriously and tons of people historically don't jive with that.
