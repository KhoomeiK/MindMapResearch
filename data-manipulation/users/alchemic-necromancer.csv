Although the way she was talking, I could see her trying to pressure him into adopting it."
RATS,ferh24u,t1_feptj5o,1579353760.0,"Personally, I don't think it's worth the risk. Two of my girls decided to work together, and one distracted me across the room, which gave the other time to pull the barrier out enough for a cat paw to get in. A claw snagged her lip and tore a chunk out. There was so much blood. My regular vet was closed and the pet ER didn't take anything but cats and dogs. 

She was fine within a couple of hours, and by the time the rat vet got in, it had already pretty much healed.

We got lucky and I only wound up with a little scar face and some stained carpet, but it could have been a LOT worse.

We reinforced the barrier, although none of our girls went near the door after that."

I definitely have a love/hate relationship with the debug items because of how hard it is to find something."
thesims,fefgr4t,t1_fef5ker,1579055984.0,"This would be useful for paintings, too! Some swatches change the actual painting, not just the frame color.

I discovered a painting Swatch of one the other day that I absolutely loved, but didn't use because it didn't fit with what I was building. And now I can't find it again."
SeriousConversation,feeyd5n,t1_feevj41,1579043920.0,"There's a difference between ""a little discomfort"" and your budget being so tight that a $50 doctor bill will cause you to overdraw your account.

Anyone working full time should make enough to have their needs reasonably met, and have a little extra left over. Otherwise they're going to be super stressed, which is going to make them more susceptible to illness. 

In middle TN, two years ago, you needed a minimum of $10/hr for 40 hours to scrape by. That was assuming you rented a room in the sticks or in one of the small towns.
After rent, you had ~$400 for food, insurance, whatever. It'd be a crappy life. And you'd better pray that there are no emergencies."
AmItheAsshole,fe5wt38,t1_fe4y78u,1578876702.0,"Yep. And if state board/whoever is in charge of licensing for the area were to walk in and catch the receptionist waxing a customer, the salon would get a hefty fine.

You can cause injury with waxing."
LifeProTips,fdwq49q,t1_fdwp29x,1578761306.0,"I wish I didn't have the experience to believe you, haha. My cube mate had someone call in because their password wasn't working and he was getting a message that he didn't understand.

The message was ""Caps Lock is on.""

This was, of course, a fault in our software and not him needing to learn.

I also had a guy that I was walking through something and he needed to hit spacebar. He asked me what the spacebar was, but I need to believe that one was just a brain fart on his end because it was the middle of our peak season and late in the day."
LifeProTips,fdwe1pa,t1_fdsf708,1578757745.0,"Same here.

They usually ask how it's spelled, too. I ask how they think it's spelled, they rattle off something that's usually wrong, and I'm just like ""You got it. How can I help you today?"""
LifeProTips,fdt28ds,t1_fdsafc9,1578710967.0,"All of these! But especially the part about getting someone else to help you if you're not confident doing something.

I did tech support for a software company, and for some stupid reason the bosses decided that it'd be part of our jobs to walk people through setting up their office networks.

We'd regularly get people that didn't know how to open up their control panel, or even what antivirus they were using, and we were supposed to help them network.

""Slow down, I'm old.""

""Ma'am, I just told you to right click and select properties.""

""Hang on, hang on.... What does right click mean?""

I wish I were exaggerating."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fdjzhva,t1_fdju8o4,1578492215.0,"The minimum tank size a single axolotl needs is a 20gallon long. It'd take up most of a normal desk. The more space they have, the more active they get (so more chances to be clumsy). 

Mine started in a 20long tank, and she was active around feeding time, but a cute lump the rest of the day. We upgraded her to a 36 gallon tank and she swims around and moonwalks up and down her log all day.

They're great pets, but definitely read up on their needs before getting one, like anything else."
AskReddit,fdii3nc,t3_eld4mi,1578443416.0,"On mobile, hopefully formatting isn't wonky.

In 6th grade, my homeroom teacher haaaaaaated me because he found out that I disliked sports, and he was one of those Sports Are Life dudes. I think he also disliked me because I'd been home schooled the prior year, but mostly it was because I would rather sit and draw instead of play sports.

Anyway.

Our class was in those portable buildings some schools have, and we shared our building with another class, separated by a thin wall. The other teacher had complained about us being loud, so Mr. Sports made a rule that if he left us unattended and came back, the first person he saw talking would get in trouble. 

I sat toward the back, along the same wall as the door. For someone to see me, they'd have to specifically turn their head to look for me. Basically, no way for me to be the first person he'd see, even if I was talking.

I was looking to my side, just watching one of my friends do something stupid. I wasn't making a peep. Mr. Sports came in, screeched ""You!"" Friend got the ""Crap, I'm in trouble,"" look because he'd been talking when the door opened.

Nope. It was me. I lost recess for a week for just looking at someone, when the entire class was chatting.

Another time, at lunch, I traded something out of my lunchbox with another kid. Mr. Sports came storming up to our table yelling about throwing food. We were all confused because we'd just passed it to each other. Nothing was thrown.  Apparently I was the only one ""throwing"" food. Despite protests of my classmates, I was forced to sit by myself at the far end of the teachers' table, five feet from the trashcans.

At the end of lunch, my class got up to throw things away and line up to go to the restrooms/after lunch recess. Typically, kids banished to The Table got up and joined their class at that point, so that's what I did. Mr. Sports lost his mind and made me sit back down until he told me I could get up.

Which he never did. A few minutes later, one of the other teachers was like ""Why are you still here? Your class left, dump your trash and join them.""

Mr. Sports caught me walking toward the restrooms by myself, and I got in trouble for wandering the halls.

There were other things, but those two still stand out over 20 years later."
AskRedditAfterDark,fdfo3oy,t1_fdfnoix,1578366177.0,"Yep, her dad.

I don't necessarily think he wrote it one-handed... It's really not that explicit at all. It mostly focuses on Bev thinking about birds. The last 100ish pages are pretty terrible and it's obvious he's on something. I feel like his drug-of-the-day went ""You know what this battle is missing? Sewer sex. With birds!"" For shock value or something."
AskRedditAfterDark,fdfj6ud,t1_fdfaci3,1578362952.0,"I just finished reading IT a couple of days ago. The train happened after they (thought they had) defeated IT and were lost in the sewers. The power that bound them together was fading so Beverly was like ""Hey, boys, put your things in me!"" To strengthen their bond so they could get out.

Also probably to keep from losing her virginity to her dad.

It makes sense in the context, but it was also a weak excuse to write a teenaged train scene."
facepalm,fde1y7q,t1_fddeatm,1578329354.0,"At my old bank, if you went in and were just like ""Hey, I need my bank statement!"" They'd just print off a list of your transactions and dates, but there's no identifying info on it. You have to specifically be like ""I need bank statements because I'm applying for a mortgage"" for them to print ones that actually have your name and such.
The generic statements are free, but to get your name on them, it's $1/page."
aww,fda2on1,t1_fd7vmc8,1578241002.0,"Like the other response said, they're not the smartest. Mine knows when it's food time, and will swim to the feeding side of her tank.... And then proceed to get too excited and completely miss the food raining down on her. 
They're derpy little things. 
Their faces just look like that. Cute lil' smile, 100% of the time. Sometimes I get lucky and catch her yawning and the cuteness goes up to 9000 (search YouTube for axolotl yawns)."
aww,fd6fk8p,t1_fd5qy76,1578190219.0,"Once you have the tank set up, they're not too difficult.

The biggest things are a big enough tank (20gallon long is the minimum recommended for a single axie) a constant, cool, temperature and making sure there's not much of a current. 
I feed mine every other day, do a daily spot clean of her tank, and a 30% water change every 6 weeks or so. She'll be 3 next month and handled a cross country move just fine."
aww,fd6db99,t1_fd49c2x,1578189226.0,I do this from mine on occasion. I have to pour it on a plate because two of them like to roll around in it and would (and have) spill a bowl.
