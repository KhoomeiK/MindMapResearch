At the end of the day, you can be right, but not get your way, OR you can be right and get you way by *communicating your ideas to them in a manner they understand*. 

Now, is that a bit manipulative? Sure. Would you perhaps be making them feel like its their idea and they came up with it? Yup. 

But if changing their mind/opinion is something you need to do in order to support your team, for example, sometimes it's better to get something than nothing at all. Part of that is learning to communicate with rigid individuals who would otherwise prefer to do nothing you suggest!"
