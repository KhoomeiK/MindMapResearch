There are detailed mathematical proofs of every tool that they do what they say on the tin.  But you are *required* to follow the instructions and limits.  As I have said my specialty is public policy analysis.  We deal with controversial topics like gun control, minimum wage, health care, whatever.  Passions and controversy abound.  Yes, I have seen garbage work passed off as a 'refutation' of good work that proves an unpopular position (this means you Black and Nagin).  I have seen lazy garbage get published too often to count.  Sure let's see that ten thousandth paper on minimum wage that lazily used government data that doesn't include people who drop out of the labor force completely.  Never mind that's there's this really good study over here...  Note that unemployed in the data does **not** mean everyone who doesn't have a job.  If you haven't looked in the last month you aren't 'unemployed' you are 'not in the labor force'.  

Every position has studies published supporting every side.  Saying 'there's a study' is meaningless.  So, no, I do not intrinsically trust academics.  I am one and know them from the inside.  They're no more honest as a group than any other random group.  Just as lazy and incompetent as well.  You think it perfectly implausible that 97% of climatologists were perpetuate bullshit.  Given the incentives in the system I find it implausible that they *wouldn't*.  I have seen overt lies and active fraud perpetuated with no financial incentive at stake, just political feelings (Bellisiles).  

As for modelling complex systems... I know a lot about that.  I know what it's limits are, and especially what the plausible limits of certainty are.  The AGW crowd are telling fairy stories.  If they were honest they would be saying ""we can explain *part* of the variation in weather patterns with this theory with such and such certainty.

Thing about statistics, it is very much not a game of do as you please.  there are very strict rules on what you can and cannot do to generate useful results.  You use a tool on data to generate numbers with specific properties to test a hypothesis.  if you break the rules the tool will still generate a set of numbers, but the numbers are meaningless.  You absolutely do not do it to 'generate a clearer picture'.  Literally all Mann does is plausible sounding bullshit to promote his agenda.  He is substituting a false narrative for the real one and not revealing anything.  note there is no coefficients, no t stats, no adjusted r^2 reported with his picture.  Those are the very point of statistical tools.This is a very big deal.  I have seen statistical bullshit and utter laziness in serious and prominent academic works many times.  

I will admit Mann does not use a spline fitting.  I haven't bothered looking at his work in decades and misremembered until I liked it up again..  A spline fitting would have looked like bent straight line.  What he does is just pointless.  Not only that, there is literally no statistical test that can be performed on his 'data set' because it isn't one.  It isn't a time series.  It's two different and unrelated series taped together.  That is pure gibberish, incompetence and basically fraud.  Don't be fooled that they seem to be measuring the same thing.  They are not.  tree rings show an average over time.  Temp measurement shows a peak.  Peak is always higher than average.  if you take an average series and tape on a peak series, guess what you get?  This is why he lost his lawsuit and never released his data despite the fact the doing so would be basic science publishing and saved him three quarters of a million dollars.  (Science is not a game of i have a secret and trust me.)

If Mann had used an actual data series (it would have to be tree rings throughout.  This has its own problems as tree ring width is a function of many inputs, temperature is only one.  you cannot 'measure' temperature with tree rings.  Btw one of them is CO2 level) and used proper tools and reported proper results... He wouldn't be an utter fraudulent incompetent jackass."
