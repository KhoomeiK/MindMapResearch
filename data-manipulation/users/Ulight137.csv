ChoosingBeggars,fel2s7o,t1_fel2ijl,1579212818.0,"No no, I mean it seems like it would be good for all parties involved. If you go to small claims you don't want to keep on posting these and your lawyer will tell you not to. Plus, it kinda feels weird to read this one because it's airing out some seemingly very private bits of this person's life including abuse (because financial abuse is abuse too). You're posting some very sensitive stuff."
ChoosingBeggars,fel1np9,t3_eplznn,1579212120.0,Stop posting these.

instantkarma,fechvkh,t1_fec9xvd,1578974300.0,">Currently there is a very young, and very vocal extremism taking place on the left in our country. 

The left? Nah, it's a big deal on the right, too, it's just that youngsters tend to be left more often.

>It's no coincidence that this happens to take place shortly after the first election, wherein many of them were old enough to vote for the first time, that their preferred candidate lost. 

It's also no coincidence that it's taking place where fascism is coming dangerously close to taking over free world in multiple countries and has spread to some like Brazil, Turkey, the Philippines, Russia... AND also while class stratification is at the highest it's ever been, you get the idea.

If this happened every time a new generation voted and their candidate lost, well, I have some bad news for you because there's young people that vote for the first time *every election*."

I agree with Sam, though. He was such a minor character that we didn't have a lot of emotional attachment to who felt almost out of place at the emotional denouement of the movie, even though he was a Cap character."
