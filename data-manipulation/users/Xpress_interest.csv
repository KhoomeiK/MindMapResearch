The Obama era ended up being a massive under-correction that failed to move the country far enough back to the left while also failing to hold Republicans accountable for Afghanistan, Iraq, the Patriot Act and all the rampant corruption that came with them. A black president also drove millions of otherwise apolitical sorts to the GOP and here we are.

In the end it isn’t about the power of unions (which in nearly every other case have been neutered by capital masquerading as the state) but about the disproportionate power of police, especially their intimate connections with the justice system at every level and ability to find understanding judges to exonerate nearly all behavior.

We’re 2-3 generations into the retraining of Americans to accept *anything* if it comes from the right channels and be willing to reject *anything* that doesn’t.

- Sorority Noise

Iâ€™m missing a bunch but these are a good start!"
Emo,fca8m7o,t1_fc9wrcv,1577564739.0,Jeez man donâ€™t apologize! Iâ€™d be so down for way more comments in this vein - even if itâ€™s just you writing super long comments to nobody in particular. There arenâ€™t nearly enough discussions here about what makes the different sounds in the scene sound...different.
Emo,fc90ifg,t3_egqt7j,1577545056.0,Gotta do your best to live your lives without the regret of causing a catastrophic venue collapse with your music.
news,fc6geij,t1_fc69thb,1577479958.0,The number of sanctimonious assholes in this thread intentionally misreading comments is insane. Donâ€™t worry about them.
news,fc6g9z7,t1_fc67s2o,1577479872.0,Iâ€™ve never seen so many comments quoting Mr. Rogers while simultaneously angrily calling others selfish pieces of shit. Sorta makes you doubt their sincerity...
news,fc6fq50,t1_fc6aw3l,1577479502.0,And calling others â€œselfish pieces of shitâ€ for suggesting employers should pay their employees for added potentially dangerous job duties? Itâ€™s pretty gross how ingrained and accepted corporate irresponsibility has become in our society.
news,fc6dxxw,t1_fc6bgir,1577478295.0,"It seems like a great program, but I see where these comments are coming from. It isnâ€™t about selfish people wanting to be paid in order to transactionally help someone. Itâ€™s a separate discussion about millionaires and billionaires signing up minimum wage employees to do the heavy lifting while they reap the benefits - in this case the goodwill and free advertising of this safe place program. Iâ€™m sure most employees are happy to help regardless, and thatâ€™s exactly what employers bank on: everybody else willing to help for the good of humanity even while theyâ€™re also being exploited and are in need of help themselves."
politics,fc41inb,t1_fc3qw3z,1577404170.0,"Weâ€™ve learned terrible lessons since Nixon. The only moral president weâ€™ve had in living memory was eviscerated by the nascent corporate media, ushering in Reagan and the post-Watergate GOP and dems, which have been all about training their bases to ignore any dissonance reality poses to their messages. Weâ€™re 2-3 generations into the retraining of Americans to accept *anything* if it comes from the right channels and be willing to reject *anything* that doesnâ€™t. 

The number of people who believe there is some sort of intrinsic left-leaning trajectory to history is pretty crazy."
