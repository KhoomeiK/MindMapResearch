ramen,ffeft1l,t1_ffeda77,1579846354.0,Were you making this from a recipe or is this your own recipe? Looks amazing!!
sandiego,ffbareb,t1_ffb0szw,1579757762.0,My half brother found his dad through Ancestry but it took a while to get a hit. I think he was on it for about a year before he found him. He was in his mid 40s when he found him and our mom passed so he had lost hope. Could just be a waiting game!
puppy101,ff7cm5m,t1_ff6tn1s,1579646435.0,That’s a good idea!! Ours is still weary of them so I should try making them fun.
DogCare,ff5ej0x,t3_erq4gg,1579589480.0,Contrary to popular belief? What normal dog owner doesn’t think their pet deserves care and love?
puppy101,ff59405,t1_ff583ya,1579583935.0,Nice! I’m glad you were able to get that rest. The hardest thing is forcing yourself out of bed when you hear that puppy whine
puppy101,ff57e4v,t3_ernv3c,1579582387.0,Did he regress and now he’s doing 8 hours again or did he just start? We’re getting close to adolescence and I’m worried we will go backwards on his amazing sleep habits!
puppy101,ff57b5n,t1_ff559l5,1579582315.0,That makes sense! This one was also blasting too- like fire reaching out of the cage on top. It was super hot underneath which probably added to the fear. He’s not very happy with the BBQ or oven when it’s on either.
puppy101,ff578vl,t1_ff51fyb,1579582259.0,"I didn’t even think of rolling luggage since we don’t travel with it often, but when our guy saw one for the first time I think he damn near had a heart attack. I felt so bad I had totally forgotten about luggage. Lol"
Eyebleach,ff4fxyq,t3_erdvyd,1579562669.0,If you go to the San Diego zoo safari park you can see one of the cheetahs race his dog buddy!
puppy101,ff4e6pq,t3_eriqtz,1579561490.0,"Rolling luggage, and those tall heaters at restaurants- which are just very very tall hot balls of fire to our dude, and totally terrifying. Lol"
sandiego,ff4dux3,t3_ereu3k,1579561272.0,We just bought a new house in Vista about a mile from Shadowridge! You guys have the best view during sunset.
food,ff4dk13,t1_ff493u3,1579561072.0,Their Thai tea one is so good I have to stop myself from eating the whole box at once. Lol
