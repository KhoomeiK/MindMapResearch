trump,ffcet6g,t1_ffceipe,1579797923.0,Thanks againâ€”I did just try to find it. Bummer! I thought Reddit wasnâ€™t like twitter and Facebook in trying to limit speech.

trump,ffcdyc6,t3_estj9x,1579797393.0,I am new to Reddit and thought that I was signing up to more of a fan page; I can find criticism of our president anywhere.

trump,ffaymjq,t1_ffacx2u,1579747516.0,"My reply got detached from the thread:

My ex-husband and now dear friend is black, my daughter is mixed, my best friend is black. In those relationships, race just really isnâ€™t much of a dynamic. We all have issues resulting from living, and Iâ€™m seeing a counselor to deal with mine. Life gives us enough burdens without reaching to the past to assume a mantle of oppression that doesnâ€™t belong to us in the present. Kanyeâ€™s got that so right! Weâ€™ve had conversations through the years, but race just doesnâ€™t really factor into how we relate to each other."

trump,ffa8d0c,t1_ffa3yq4,1579729868.0,"Honestly, I donâ€™t personally know anyone who doesnâ€™t think that way. The Trump supporters I know adhere very much to MLKâ€™s notion of â€œcontent of their characterâ€; race, creed, color, gender donâ€™t figure into our assessments of people. 
Of course there are plenty of people on Twitter who stress identity politics, but thatâ€™s on the left. I truly donâ€™t see that happening on the right, certainly not among the people with whom Iâ€™m involved."

That and an occasional spray of the carpet with Static Guard keeps the shocks at bay. 
Two dogs, rare shocks. 
Good luck!"

Iâ€™m thinking twist and rip and doing partial dreads. I like a very messy look. Just wondering what anyone experienced might have to say. I did one small section with T&R and kept it in for about a week. I loved it, but took it out because I hadnâ€™t done any proper sectioning."
Dreadlocks,fewlqfz,t3_eqrtd4,1579413876.0,I had extensions installed to get an idea how I might feel about dreads. Have started removing the extensions and am planning on having (at least) partial dreads soon. So excited to begin the journey! All the best to you on your journey!

dogs,fejd02f,t3_epcl4l,1579167915.0,"Awww, Iâ€™m so sorry to read this. I have an almost 15-year-old JRT myself, who is my female â™¥ï¸ dog. When I got her as a puppy, a vet told me on multiple occasions to be glad that she would never be the size of the pitbull I had at the time. Also, according to Temple Grandon, when the dog genome was mapped, it was discovered that the Jack Russell Terrier lacks the submissive gene. Think about that... I just donâ€™t know how effectively you can train an 11-yr-old JRT out of this pugnacity. Iâ€™d suggest separation. And Iâ€™d be super careful with his relationship to the new pup. I currently have an almost 8-yr-old Staffie girl in addition to my JRT, and the JRT will go after the Staffie if Iâ€™ve not managed high-value treats carefully enough and *will not back down*â€”Iâ€™ve had to diligently train the Staffie to avoid responding to confrontations and provocations and have to monitor them constantly. I separate them whenever I leave the house. 
Something has changed the dynamic between your pups, whether it was the introduction of the new pup or not, I donâ€™t know. But I think your JRT needs you to save him from himself. ðŸ˜¢"

dogs,fej8qjr,t3_ep5jpm,1579161759.0,"If she had some wheels to help her be able to move around, how do you think sheâ€™d be? 
Sounds like her lack of mobility is the biggest issue. You can get diapers for her. If sheâ€™s eating/drinking and still â€œherself,â€ Iâ€™d wait. If you canâ€™t bear the thought of letting her go, that it might be too soon, Iâ€™d wait. 
Iâ€™ve had to make the decision twice, and I couldnâ€™t make it until the dogs let me know they needed to leave. Sheâ€™ll let you know. My last one, 12-yr-old boy in January of 2018, I brought him home in spite of a vet saying I should put him to sleep. He wasnâ€™t ready, and I wasnâ€™t because he wasnâ€™t. One evening soon after, he looked at me; and I understood that look as plain as if he had said out loud, â€œI donâ€™t want to go, but I need to go.â€ So I let him. It broke my heart, but HE was ready. Sheâ€™ll let you know when she needs to leave. â™¥ï¸"

""There is a cycle of love and death that shapes the lives of those who choose to travel in the company of animals. It is a cycle unlike any other. To those who have never lived through its turnings or walked its rocky path, our willingness to give our hearts with full knowledge that they will be broken seems incomprehensible. Only we know how small a price we pay for what we receive; our grief, no matter how powerful it may be, is an insufficient measure of the joy we have been given.""

Only thing I have to offer is donâ€™t let him off-leash in an unfenced area until he has a bullet-proof recallâ€”and maybe not even then? Not experienced with hounds, but Iâ€™ve read that they can take off. Others with experience with them can offer more, Iâ€™m sure."
Dreadlocks,fctwbku,t3_eiwcoq,1577962850.0,"I just watched videos by Lazy Dreads on YouTube. He said as locks mature, they shrink up and tighten, then grow length again.

Hope it helps."
