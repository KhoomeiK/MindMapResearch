I am absolutely shocked at the replies to this thread. I expected to be downvoted and brigaded like crazy from ravenous Revan fanboys. He's so beloved by everybody."
swtor,fftjmbf,t1_fftgedc,1580222272.0,"I dunno, Sidious and Nihilus at least have some nuance. True, Darth Sidious becomes the most OP thing ever after Return of the Jedi, which is dumb, but before that he experiences struggle and hardship. Darth Sidious in the Darth Plagueis novel is great, and Nihilus is wonderful because he's a living symbol of what's wrong with the Sith: they are immensely powerful, but that's because of the Force, they rely on it, and in turn if you take it away they become no better than anyone else. 

Vitiate by contrast, especially in regards to origins comes off like a bad fanfic by somebody that just wants their original custom character to be better than everyone else's. What's his story?! The way KOTOR 2 built up the True Sith, they were supposed to be unique, almost Lovecraftian. Never before have I seen such a terrible backstory for a villain. He's borderline Rey levels of Mary Sue. This villain is so bad I cringe every time I think about him.

""Tenebrae's eyes were said to be as black as the void of space, and even as an infant he showed no emotion, nor did he ever cry. Animals avoided him, and his voice seemed to carry power and weight beyond his years.""

So he's the anti-Christ. He's born evil and kills and tortures people at age six. Great writing. /s

""Tenebrae's stepfather confronted his wife in front of a six-year-old Tenebrae, and he proceeded to attack her in anger after she admitted to having had an affair with Lord Dramath. However, Tenebrae fed off the man's anger to fuel his own strength in the dark side, and he used his newfound powers to telekinetically break the farmer's neck. Tenebrae then tortured his mother for months with the Force before killing her for betraying their family, and began to subjugate the other members of his village with his powers.

Over the course of the next four years, Tenebrae's influence and reputation grew as he conquered neighboring villages and raised legions of followers. Some followed the child out of fear of his immense power, while others served out of fanatical loyalty."" And also a couple of years after that Marka Ragnos gave him his own planet ""because he was just so impressed with the 13 year old and his super awesome unstoppable power!""

*********** WHAT?! You know what this crappy villain sounds like? It sounds like something an edgy teenager would write for a fanfic because he wanted to make his character betterer and strongerer than his friend's character.

""Oh yeah? Well my character was so strong that he could beat Revan!""

""Well...well my character ruled a planet as a kid!""

""Well MY character could eat all life on a planet!"""
swtor,fftgyu6,t1_fftfz7r,1580220259.0,"Oh man, Valkorion is almost as OP as Legends Sidious. In Legends he could kill all life on a planet with that power from light years away (Dark Empire and the Book of Sith) which is something **I really hate.** So they bring over a fleet killing/planet killing ability into Rise of Skywalker, only to have it blocked with two lightsabers after it EMP's an entire fleet. How does that make sense?

 Darth Sidious in Return of the Jedi is awesome. Afterwards, meh. If you're going to have a character with that kind of power, at least also make it their greatest weakness like Nihilus. Nihilus is great because it shows that the greatest strength of the Sith is also their downfall. It's symbolic for what a Sith would be if they didn't have the Force. 

Their two pillars of power:
Nihilus-power in the Force, and Sion- the *will* to power in the Force, and yet remove the Force from either of them and they both die. They literally can't live without it. They rely on it. That in turn makes them weak. Symbolism is great. 

Being a fanboy of a character simply because they are super powerful is not. If somebody likes Revan, fine. I can't take that away, but I'm not going to along with it either."
swtor,fftg5x3,t1_fftfojv,1580219608.0,"You are absolutely correct. I have problems with him and SWTOR because there was *potential* with him. He wasn't much of anything but he could have been great. But nah. God I hate the Revan novel and SWTOR's story. The game itself is good (the class stories are cool) but the overall plot is disgusting. 

It's like Revan's potential was sacrificed to build up the worst villain in Star Wars. The Mary Sue of the Dark Side. Vitiate/Valkorion is like fanfic level bad, at least with his origins."
swtor,fftfuhq,t1_fftelsb,1580219345.0,"I know what you mean.

swtor,fftf3vk,t1_fftdixu,1580218726.0,"That's what I mean, in KOTOR 2 he actually seemed like a person, a *character* with motivations and intelligence. After that it's just that he has a cool mask...Alrighty then.
