electricians,fcx11pe,t1_fcwvqco,1578046439.0,"It’s extremely rare to have a set with a 9mm, generally 8,10 skipping 9.  9mm exists but it’s esentisly a specialty tool, I think there’s some truck breaks out there that require it. But If you wanted to mess with the new guy or get someone to stop hovering over your shoulder asking them to grab a 9mm Allen should do the trick and less obvious then the ole left hanged crescent."

electricians,fct36f5,t1_fcsasef,1577931680.0,"My know it all entitled neighbor is having solar installed on his house. He shoots me a txt asking for a 9mm Allen wrench,  I reply that that’s essentially like asking for a left handed crescent wrench “well the electrician asked if I could track one down”  best laugh I’ve had in a grip. I feel for the electrician"

castiron,fc1xy24,t1_fc1mfe1,1577333186.0,"Thanks for the interest. I (30 yr old) found this in my grandfathers barn who passed when I was 2-3 years old, I do believe my father had been using it for Some time also, but he passed when I was 16. It was on a pressure treated wooden  stand and had been covered in a plastic sheet that melted to it when last stored. I tore it down completely and replaced all hardware plus fresh paint and of course lots of vinegar to break down the rust. It’s on a metal frame with casters that I built."
