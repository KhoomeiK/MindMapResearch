Try to distract yourself with something, even if it means indulging heavily in your favorite tv show or an intricate hobby. If you have any meds for anxiety, make sure you’re taking then. Maybe see if you can get some over-the-counter melatonin, and load up on that before you go to sleep.

I had one therapist even “fire” me because she could not handle the fucked up brain I was (and still kind of am). I’m not usually for this, but if you think they’re going to end up spitting you out worse off than when you went in, try to learn to work the system. It may take a while, but maybe you can ease out with some negotiating. It sounds like the people you’re working with are kind of crappy. I’m not quite sure what you mean by saying that you’re “escalating in levels of care”, but if they keep treating you like you’re getting worse and worse, when you, in fact, are not, try to get out. 

I dunno. Maybe this advice is shit. I feel for you, though. What do you mean that society has shunned you?

(By the way, you are not, by any means, “damaged goods”. You may be a little broken, but that doesn’t have to be part of your title. You are not nearly as broken as they tell you. Really. I know it probably means next to nothing coming from some stranger, but it’s true. I’m not one to lie.)"

It’s alright, man. One step at a time. You can never take anything back, and it may always stay with you, but you can learn to lighten the load and carry it. It may be harder than the average person’s task of living, but you got it.

Yes it is important to destigmatize mental health, but it should still not be talked about with levity. It still holds the same weight, it is just more open now. Obviously mental health is important for everyone, but I’ve met some people who make mental illness (which does not apply to everyone) a personality trait. They figure that they should be fucked up because everyone else is talking about it. This is not true for all young people, but it irks me to no end when people make up mental issues because it’s tReNdY. Come on now, peeps. Show some respect.

Edit: just wanted to clear a small detail up. 

What I mean by “it should not be talked about with levity” is that tasteless jokes for the sake of ostracizing people who struggle or shock factor are inappropriate. 

I did not mean that it always has to be a somber topic. Humor is one of the best ways to cope and be able to share your struggles with loved ones in a non-threatening way.

Thanks to the people who pointed that out. :-)"
AskReddit,ffdibah,t1_ffcse82,1579821467.0,"A similar story: I was eating out on New Year’s Eve with my family a few years back when a lady rushes in explaining that she had just escaped her abusive husband, and that she and her children were staying at a nearby motel. She asked if we could spare 12 dollars, which was just enough for her to pay for the night. My father, a very generous and humble man, slipped her 40 (or some amount larger than she asked for), and bid her on her way. 

About a year later my mom was having a nice late lunch about 8 miles from where we had dinner that night. She caught a familiar lady, speaking to some customers, out of the corner of her eye. She stared at the lady for a while before realizing it was the same exact lady, telling the same exact story. When the lady noticed she was being watched she hightailed it out of there. 

It brought a whole different sense of sadness to her *true* story. She’s probably an addict or something along those lines."

AskReddit,fezvt7m,t1_fezpreh,1579462309.0,"Superiority is subjective. There’s no way to measure who is best when we don’t even know what we’re measuring. It really depends on the individual’s values and opinions. 

Someone could think they are superior because they own a multi million dollar company, while the other think he is superior because he has a happy family, while another may may feel superior because he can play piano. Who knows? 

I guess it’s okay to think that you are better than another person at something. Like if you feel better at managing money, tending to your family’s needs, or reading music. But, imo, it is not okay to see that you are better at one aspect than them and assume that you are better than them as a whole. We all “outrank” each other in one way or another.

It’s hard for me to get a job. I don’t have public transportation where I live (which is the stupidest thing, I know), and I don’t have my own car, so I’d have to depend on my parents for transportation, which is a huge burden on them. They’re busy as it is. 

Plus, because of my age, I was rejected from multiple jobs, as the laws in my state are very restricting. I just recently had my birthday, so maybe I should try again. 

I really want to get a car, and my therapist is vouching for it, as I need to get out of my house. I hope I don’t sound super spoiled. My dad said he wants to get me car, but he seems reluctant. 

Also, forgot to mention: I’m graduating a year early, so I’ll be leaving the house at 17. Do you think that’s a huge difference developmentally? Will it be harder than if I was 18? 

Thanks for listening. I’m scared, yet excited. I know I want to get out of my house, as my living situation isn’t ideal, but what will I do after that? I’m determined and hopeful, but I don’t know if “chasing my dreams” is going to be worth it. 

Also, is there a way I can learn basic financial skills? Overall, I suck at all things money, and school is literally useless when it comes to basic skills for life. I’ve begged my parents to help teach me, but they’re both too busy or don’t care enough to even talk about it. I’m so underprepared for that aspect of being on my own. How exactly do I budget? How exactly do you do taxes? What are all the different kind of bills? How much do bills vary based on location? How do you invest in stocks? Is it worth it? How does credit work? What exactly is your “credit score”? How does interest vary? How expensive is renting an apartment in the city? How do you split it amongst roommates? Does living in a dorm save you money? I dont even know how to cash a fucking check or open a bank account!!!

His parents spent all their money on their eldest kid going to college, leaving all the other kids kind of completely on their own (as spoiled as it sounds to be complaining about not having your parents pay for part of your higher education).

AskReddit,fefkrfr,t3_eoo9kn,1579058412.0,"As others have said, I don’t say offensive things just to say them, you have to use finesse when implementing dark humor into life. Rape is 100% off limits, especially having been friends with victims. Never, in any context, will that *ever* be funny. Some of the “rape jokes” I’ve heard... well they didn’t sound like jokes. 

In general, most of my dark jokes are self-aimed. It’s a good way to share your humor, not offend anyone, and slightly reveal your eternal struggle with depression, anxiety, suicide, and trauma in a comical and nonchalant way."

AskReddit,fe2cm8j,t3_enmvjq,1578836874.0,"My grandparents house used to have this one music box that would play a really sweet version of “On My Own”. 

That was my favorite place as a kid. It was so safe, and filled with my wonderful cousins and aunts and uncles and grandparents. We would play “town” and create worlds of ridiculous imaginative tales. We would pretend to be puppies, and moms, and police. We would sing original songs about pie, and watch tv while we ate breakfast. We would all get matching pjs for Christmas, and have a “pajama parade” around the house. We collected tons of inside jokes throughout the years. We went through familial troubles together. Heartbreak and joy. We cried and laughed together. We shared our greatest fears and wounds. 

Now my grandfather has passed, as has my closest uncle. Some of the cousins are married and off, living their lives. Others have experienced so much hurt that they’re forever changed. I still talk to my closest cousins, but we live states away. Innocence is gone amongst us all.

I miss that. And sometimes, when I hear a music box, I just cry."
