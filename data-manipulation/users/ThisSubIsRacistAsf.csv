Note: (below, wasn't already said, I'm responding)

>By NIMBY groups, using policies or govt. regulations to ""exclude"" competition I'd assume these ""interest"" groups have the power to influence regulations. Otherwise, it wouldn't matter what group you belong to, you could use the same regulations to ""exlude"" competition in the same way an ""interest"" group does.

Now the reason I asked could an ""interest"" group change a ""ghetto"" into a higher valued area, was because I had the assumption that they have the power to change policies that could allow these same interest groups to get incentives (tax abatements, improvement on land deals with govt owned properties, etc. ) to help change an area's value. Also, I didn't understand fully how value was determined. I've seen ""high"" property tax neighborhoods that aren't as good (upkeep) as lower middle class neighborhoods. And I thought you could explain that to me in more depth."

badeconomics,ffc0lul,t1_ff9wjvo,1579788475.0,"No, no, no. In the actual case for why OP believes 1% exist (which I think he's wrong because of the functions of making money and being athletic are different), your example is wrong. OP asked ""why does M.J. shoot 3 points so good?"" Implying that he is naturally a better 3 point shooter than most people. But why is he better ""naturally"". Well he had to be ""given"" this talent right?? Okay, regardless of socioeconomic status, Bill Gates would have never made it to the NBA, because his abilities physically would never add up. Nor could any amount of training get him there. But his chances would increase with the abilities of his parents before him. I don't believe the 1% of the NBA and the 1% of ""money earners"" have any correlation because the functions to get there are so different. However, I could be wrong."
badeconomics,ff92i2f,t1_ff6i5bi,1579703235.0,"Don't you think in that case, that the closest example to that would be NBA players who were born into athletic families?? Stephan Curry, Mahomes, Klay Thompson, Ray Lewis, Jon Jones, Gronkowski, etc. All these guys had fathers or mothers that played professional sports. I'm willing to bet, that the majority of NBA players have parents that played sports on an elite level. The inheritied their an abilities and so now they have the ease of being able to make it to a professional sport than any other avg Joe."

We have seen Cerrone get the snot beat outta him, and still fight.

I say stuck because I could potentially make a lot of money here and the CEO is a legend in real estate world in Ohio, and I get to talk to him everyday if I wanted to. So I just don't want to waste a good opportunity to make some real scratch and learn some real skills, for chasing a Investment banking dream that people say is hard to break into and it's not as lucrative. I'm just have an avg Intelligence, good work ethic, trying to make the best decision for the long term. Working a job isn't really something I like doing anyways, I'd much rather train and be a fighter or something, but getting my brains Knocked out for pennies is hardly something I dreamed of.

AskEconomics,fdl1rea,t1_fdibgp7,1578515549.0,">This study formulates an alternative empirical model to that of Groot (Applied Economics Letters, 5, 535–8, 1998) to estimate the rate of depreciation of human capital, in which the post-schooling investment and the difference between the potential and the observed earnings of the individuals are taken into account. As an illustration, the model has been estimated for a sample of Spanish men and women. The results show depreciation rates of human capital of around 1–1.5% per year.

I'm sorry what exactly are you saying? I couldn't follow. Are you saying that post-schooling (graduate school I assume) leads to faster human capital deprec (I assume that means productivity drops off, and bottom line profits drop). What do you mean, I got super confused.
