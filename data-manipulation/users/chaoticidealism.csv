Heck, two thousand years ago Jesus said ""Man cannot live by bread alone, but by every word from the mouth of God""---and this was a guy who had experienced hunger and was at that moment homeless. He was saying that knowing your place in the universe, knowing your relationship to God and what God wanted from you, was just as vital as having food to eat.

If you are one of those extreme introverts who truly does well without emotional intimacy, you're in the minority, but that doesn't necessarily make you unhealthy. Only if it's part of a bigger picture of being emotionally detached, passionless, and uninterested in the world does extreme introversion merit any kind of diagnosis or counseling."

What humans really need is interaction and social stimulation. That can be indirect, by way of phone calls and Internet and even books, and it can even be provided by an animal; but it has to be there. Introverts need less, but bond more deeply; extroverts need more. In childhood, we need physical contact and interaction to learn and develop properly, and in adulthood we do better emotionally with human contact. Sex is only one of many kinds of human contact, and though allosexuals who don't have sex may miss it, they can still have happy lives without it. 

Lack of interaction and social stimulation is part of what makes solitary confinement torturous. If we put someone in solitary but gave them a phone and a bookshelf, it would no longer be torture."
disability,ffd3rq9,t3_esuqps,1579812849.0,"Yeah, that's internalized prejudice. I went through that for a while with my autism--because I look normal, because I can walk and wipe my own butt and so on. I told myself I just wasn't trying hard enough, that I was actually just lazy. It didn't help that this was what my (abusive) mother told me repeatedly growing up, why I didn't get any therapy or special ed as a child. Instead of therapy, I got taken out of school and home-schooled, and told I was lazy, rude, selfish, obnoxious, etc. so I wouldn't be ""labeled"" as having a disability.

The stereotypical disability is obvious, severe, and always visible. With that stereotype stuck in our heads, we are hesitant to call a disability a disability when it isn't obvious to the casual observer, when it isn't extreme to the point of needing 24-hour care, when it isn't physical, or when it varies in severity so that you have some good days.

And have a chance to keep your education in some sort of order, which you wouldn't do in a program.

Ironically, access to your parents is protective. Programs know that if you can logically expect to be able to tell your parents ""They didn't feed me yesterday"", then they'll probably feed you. That means you want to be somewhere where your parents can visit you anytime on a whim--in the same town, preferably; an hour's drive away at most. 

Explain to your parents that you don't want to move away from them, away from your family. Tell them you want to go somewhere local, so you can sleep in your own bed at night. If you've fallen behind in school, ask about tutors and summer programs; if you need mental health help, ask about outpatient programs and day programs. There are options in between ""no help at all"" and ""residential program"", and they are all better than a residential program.

If you are in serious mental health crisis, your best bet is to get into a local hospital's mental ward, get stable on meds, and then go home or to a day program. Staying institutionalized is dangerous. Being institutionalized somewhere out of town is horrendously dangerous. 

Stay out of institutions. If you can't stay out, get your parents to look for short-term placements.

A few extremely advanced healers or very strong Jedi have used it to directly cure disease, but it tends to be very difficult, takes a long time, and depends greatly on the patient's will to live.

Extending life is not something light-side Jedi tend to do at all, but becoming a Force spirit after death is completely possible, and does imply a sort of quasi-immortality because the spirit keeps its personality from life. To do this, a Jedi has to accept death as a natural part of the Force.

raisedbynarcissists,ff05fs0,t1_feue1qq,1579465361.0,"CW: Frank discussion of self-injury and suicide.

This might be controversial, but I actually wouldn't categorize self-injury (the superficial sort that involves small scratches, cuts, burns, and bruises) as ""serious"". Yes, it's an indicator of severe stress, but it's also extremely common, and it's not a psychiatric emergency the way psychosis or a suicidal crisis would be. Survey research found about one in six college students report having self-injured on one or more occasions. Self-injury is a coping mechanism--something you do to try to bring yourself out of dissociation, or deal with overwhelming emotions, or use the adrenaline rush to push past exhaustion.

But it's not a good coping mechanism, because when the effect wears off, your problems are still there. It's in the same category as drinking too much, eating too much, exercising to injury and exhaustion; it's abusing yourself to try to cope with life.

Self-injury, as an indication of severe stress, is often present alongside depression and anxiety disorders, but sometimes it exists on its own, and sometimes it's part of a personality disorder like emotionally unstable personality disorder or CPTSD. Regardless of whether it's comorbid to another mental illness, it's not the same thing as suicidal self-injury (attempting to kill oneself, or making a suicidal gesture) or major self-injury (which usually happens during a psychotic episode and is much more dangerous).

The best way to treat a self-injury problem is to find out why you are resorting to self-injury, why you need it, and what else you could do instead to either serve the same purpose, or else change your approach so that you don't get into the situations where you need it to begin with. Cognitive-behavioral therapy helps, if the therapist doesn't freak out over your self-injury habit (some do; it's probably a visceral ""injury=bad=emergency"" thing; if you find one like that, find another) and is willing to help you find common-sense solutions."

The theory is that you analyze the child's behavior, decide which things you want the child to do and stop doing, figure out which things prompt the child to do or not do things, and either remove the prompts or add more prompts while rewarding desired behavior and either ignoring or punishing undesired behavior.

ABA is based on the supposition that the mind is a ""black box"" whose contents are unknowable and thus irrelevant, and that stimulus and response are the only components of behavior that it is useful to analyze. It dates back to Skinner boxes and behaviorism, when it was heretical for a psychologist to even talk about an animal's internal state or ascribe emotions to it.

autism,fev2hwd,t1_fesw956,1579392374.0,"True, but often times it's not ABA that makes us seem robotic. It's often just us doing our best to learn NT communication and not quite getting all the subtleties. It's like someone who is inexperienced at sketching trying to draw a human face; the face looks wrong not because they don't understand the task but because they have yet to gain a high level of skill. Trying to make small talk, as an autistic person who understands why NTs make small talk (that is, a conversation focused on social connection rather than information transfer), can still be quite difficult even if you have watched a lot of NT small talk and are trying to fit yourself to the patterns. We seem robotic because our behavior when we try to speak the NT language is drawn from an abstract understanding of what we are trying to do, but without the many nuances that NTs use and don't even really know they are using.

I think that when it comes to communicating, it is best to focus on the communication itself, not on whether it looks unusual. We have to figure out how to get the NTs to understand what we are saying, without conveying any unintentional, false information as well. To do that, we have to study how NTs think and how they perceive other people, so that we can send signals they will understand. That is easier said than done but it is the goal."

I have occasionally talked to autistics and/or therapists (yea, there are autistic therapists) who call their therapy ABA mostly for insurance reasons, but actually use an approach closer to play therapy and speech therapy for younger ones, and CBT or sociology/psychology classes for older ones.

If it's actual ABA, even if it never uses aversives or negative reinforcement, even if the therapist is well-meaning and always appears kind, it's abusive.

Yeah, it makes sense to get rid of the knife. If at this point in your recovery you feel better without sharp knives around, then you do what helps you feel better. Someday when you're better it'll be time to work with knives, to use them as tools and divorce them from their connotations of self-injury; but for now, in the early stages, your desire to keep yourself away from sharp objects is rational and sensible. Don't develop a superstition about it; just think of it as a way to make it more inconvenient for you to self-injure while you're trying to develop some better coping methods.

Incidentally: I had a rather stubborn self-injury habit myself that I was hospitalized for twice in my mid-twenties. Now at age 36 I am stable and have lots of other ways to cope. I haven't hurt myself in quite some time--years, probably; haven't felt I needed it for so long that I've stopped counting.

Learn to put those to work; use leverage and stay aware of how the center of mass shifts when you lift something. Cis women, if they care about using their bodies to do physical labor or play sports, learn how to put them to best use to the extent that many of them can keep up with a same-sized cis man despite his higher overall muscle mass. You can learn the same skills as your own muscle distribution changes. I recommend things like yard work, sports, walking for transportation, anything that keeps you moving."

autism,fefe8b6,t3_eorny9,1579054441.0,"Yeah, women are often underdiagnosed. The stereotypical autistic person is a boy; girls fly under the radar unless their autism is extreme, obvious, or both.

If you immediately recognize yourself in the experiences of other late-diagnosis autistic women, I wouldn't be surprised if you were autistic yourself; and if not autistic, then at least having strong autistic traits.

Regarding bipolar disorder: I wouldn't immediately discard the diagnosis; it's entirely possible to have both that and autism. Before my autism was diagnosed, in my early twenties, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and major depression; after the autism diagnosis, the borderline personality disorder was discarded (it had never fit, and had really been quite useless), but the depression diagnosis was still quite as valid as it had been before we started considering autism as a possibility. It's common for us to have more than one valid label, and looking at the whole picture will best help you to figure out who you are, the help and accommodations you need as well as the things that are simply part of you and are better just accepted."

cataclysmdda,feez5kr,t1_fee84qp,1579044430.0,"It would be an interesting trait to have, for sure. Not everyone sees it that way, and in a world with very few people left and thus very few hunters to put pressure on the animal population, it wouldn't be particularly bad for the animal population--but it could be considered disrespectful to the animal to kill it and then not eat it.

It would be a hard trait to code, though. How do you detect what counts as wastefulness? What if you don't have the ability to butcher the animal? What if you killed it because it attacked you and you were defending yourself? I think it would have to be simplified somehow--maybe a trait that gives a morale penalty for having food rot in your inventory?"
cataclysmdda,feeyt2r,t1_feegu47,1579044204.0,"Exactly. I mean, think about it; say you're in a lifeboat with three other people, but you're badly injured and you're going to die; do you hate them for eating your body once you're gone? Heck no. They're just doing what they have to do. Might even make you feel a little better about the whole dying thing to know that your body will be helping them survive."
cataclysmdda,feeydk1,t1_fee7wkl,1579043926.0,"Sure, one's more common than the other, but does that really make it more morally acceptable?

Humans see various actions as undesirable, but we see them that way for different reasons. There are some things that we are taught to see as ""disgusting"", while other things are categorized as ""evil"", and they're not the same thing. Trouble is, we often squash those two things together in the same category (cf. ugly villains, pretty heroes).

So you're looking at your reaction to an arbitrary cold-blooded murder, comparing it to your disgust at the thought of eating a fetus, noticing that the second one gives you a stronger emotional reaction, and assuming that must mean the second one would be worse. But is the thing that you find more viscerally repulsive also necessarily the more damaging to your psyche in the long run?"
cataclysmdda,feexmut,t1_feek0u2,1579043447.0,"Generally ""baby"" refers to a baby that has already been born, but with added context (""The baby keeps kicking me in the bladder!"") it can easily mean a fetus. ""Baby"" is generic and it works perfectly well for the purpose.

If you want to specify the age of the newbie homo sapiens in question, you can go with zygote > embryo > fetus > neonate > infant. You will sound clinical, but you'll be precise. If you don't particularly care, you can just say ""baby"" and, I promise, English speakers will understand you."

cataclysmdda,fee8ni7,t1_fee7pwl,1579028670.0,"Absolutely. Killing an innocent man would haunt me for years to come. Eating a baby that was already dead when I found it would just nauseate me occasionally when I thought about it.

That's why I mentioned ""Alive!"" and its account of desperation cannibalism and how people cope with having to eat the dead. They were saddened, disgusted, desperate--but they weren't coming down with raging cases of PTSD."
cataclysmdda,fee3ogi,t1_fedxn3k,1579025736.0,"Er, yes. You are indeed eating a dead baby. Why do you think it's a -60 morale hit, the worst for anything short of murder?"
TransyTalk,fedr5db,t3_eohp69,1579018107.0,She's trans? Dang... that's kinda awesome. I have to try watching her videos now and I don't even wear makeup.
cataclysmdda,fedqk22,t3_eoku7j,1579017733.0,"Nah, that makes sense to me. The fetus is already dead and you didn't kill it--you were just desperate enough to eat it. That's pretty darn terrible of course, being that hungry (or desperate for mutagen). But directly killing another human being who (theoretically) is innocent and never did any harm to you is even worse than eating human flesh.

Ever read ""Alive!"", the story of the plane crash survivors who had to resort to cannibalism? It was a pretty hard experience for them, but they would have felt even worse had they been responsible for a human death. From what we know about desperation cannibalism, it doesn't tend to be nearly as traumatic as you might think it is, whereas killing another human being seems to be nearly universally traumatic. The -60 hit for a human fetus makes sense because it's a whole human that looks like a small baby; a less-visibly-human piece of meat is less traumatic (there's a reason that people who resort to cannibalism in desperate times usually avoid faces and hands; they're recognizably human).

The morale hit is completely legitimate. What needs to be tweaked is NPC behavior--what a passive NPC will and won't do. We should be able to designate areas or vehicles as belonging to us (perhaps by building signs and designating zones based on them), wherein non-hostile NPCs won't do any damage or pick up any items."

I bet she was afraid your sister would start liking you, if she lived with you. She was afraid your sister would start to act on her sisterly affection and natural tendency to want to help her family.

She did this because she's worried that your sister will wiggle out of her GC training and helplessness. I bet right now your sister is getting love-bombed and told how much better than you she is...

But you're free, and your sister is still in the spider's web. With any luck your mom will turn on her as well, and when that happens, you'll have to hold a safety net for your sister. But for now, just focus on getting established yourself, getting stable and independent. When your sister needs your couch, she gets it.

I guess that's something we have in common with cis folks; we all feel the pressure to conform to stereotypes, whether it's a matter of passing better or not being ridiculed or not being seen as odd.
