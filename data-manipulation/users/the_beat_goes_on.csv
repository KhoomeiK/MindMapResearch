genetics,ff6ot3y,t1_ff67xyu,1579631754.0,"I agree with this advice. I'll expand on it to say- a typical path would be to get an undergrad degree related to biology, either an engineering degree (biomedical engineering or chemical/ biomolecular engineering, for example) or a science degree (biology, genetics). Science degrees are good if you want to work in academia as a professor doing research to discover new knowledge about biology/ genetics. Engineering degrees are good if you want to develop new technologies/ apply the knowledge gained by scientists (whether in academia or industry). Do a lot of research in undergrad, try to get a publication if possible. Make good relationships with at least 3 professors (go to their office hours, ask advice- one of these will be who you're doing research with, so you'll have a stronger relationship with them). This is because you'll need 3 good recommendation letters from professors to help you get into grad school (also helpful for industry jobs). Next, either go into industry with a bachelor's if you're ok working not in a leadership role. Or, get a Phd if you want to work in a leadership role (whether in academia (like becoming a professor running a research lab) or in industry)."
HomeworkHelp,ff1u9nu,t3_er5v42,1579486325.0,"Themes aren't so hard. When you think of Goodfellas, what are the top three things that come to mind? I'd say organized crime, violence as a tool, and a hunger for power are prominent in the movie- these are some of its themes. Misogyny is another. Next, think of some other media that share those themes. Surely, news articles about organized crime would. So would movies and books from the same genre. You could structure your report as discussing one theme at a time and showing other examples of where that theme is displayed in the other media."

Biochemistry,febvcyz,t3_eoctrv,1578963106.0,"I can speak to my experience. I was a music technology undergrad who worked in studios for a few years and decided to go back to school for engineering. I had to do a second undergrad in materials science and engineering (starting at 26 years old), during which time I did a lot of research. I graduated in 2018 and started a PhD in bioengineering, and I love it- I'm 32 now and I'm very happy about the decision to switch focus. 

Since you're so young, I think you shouldn't feel constrained at all by your background. If it's more interesting to you, it'll make for a better life overall, even if it takes you more time to get through school.

HomeworkHelp,fdcblu6,t1_fda4oos,1578271039.0,"Good point- it's hard to tell visually whether the right and left edges of the semicircle would have more than one point on a vertical line. In this case, we have to use a bit of mathematical analysis. A circle is made up of all the points in a plane that are equidistant (r units) from a center point. The points on the x axis are r away from the center, but what about the points right next to those at the edge of the circle? In order to still be r away from the center point, if they're less than r away on the x axis, they have to be some distance greater than 0 away on the y axis (the distance you could find with the pythagorean theorem). Thus, no two points are r distance away but with the same x axis value, so it must pass the vertical line test. 

Another way to think about it is that a circle is continuously curving, so there are no straight lines on its surface, so it can't fail the vertical line test (so long as it's just a semi-circle and not more)."

sciences,fcmbajg,t1_fclvzs0,1577769410.0,"""I'll tell you about it when you're older"" is probably what I'd tell a five year-old. I'd be happy to explain it to you, though. Assuming you know what proteins are and that they're made out of amino acids according to the genetic code: protein functions depend on protein structure. Protein structure is devilishly complicated to predict based only on the amino acid sequence, because many things influence how a protein folds, including hydrogen bonding from surrounding water molecules and the quantum mechanics of amino acid electrical interaction. Modeling how proteins fold based on their sequence alone is something of a holy grail, because it would allow us to design more effective drugs more quickly, not to mention useful biomolecules and biotech of all kinds. One important influence on how amino acids fold is what they're surrounded by, and newly-added amino acids are surrounded by previously added amino acids when they emerge from the ribosome, which may or may not themselves already be participating in a folding interaction. In short, the protein folds as it's being made, and this is important to keep in mind when modeling protein folding."
