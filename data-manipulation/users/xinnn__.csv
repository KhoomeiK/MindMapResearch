depression,fcvspjs,t1_fcvrjma,1578009239.0,"besides being anonymous on Reddit, i haven't told anyone irl except one of my closest friends that i feel this way and to be totally honest sometimes I wonder whether its just a figment of my imagination and im just overreacting, because I feel like theres no way I could actually be sad for reasons ive already mentioned."
Crushes,fcvrhq5,t1_fcvmntq,1578008450.0,"yo the group chat hits different u know, like, on the one hand, you want them to notice, on the other hand you dont, and imma grow a third hand because youre hoping no one else notices"

depression,fcvom4m,t1_fcvk57k,1578006612.0,"honestly as someone whos only 16 i aint got much business saying ""oh yeah i relate to this"" seeing other people worse-off than me really just kinda hits rubs salt in the wound for me, like, my life is, realistically, pretty good and im still pulling reasons to be sad out of my arse :/. think what OP said about being ""replaceable"" is actually my whole vibe"
Crushes,fcvo13o,t1_fcsrgoq,1578006244.0,"yeah that too, honestly, the amount of times ive rephrased something is unreal"
Crushes,fcsn6ho,t3_eikqem,1577920181.0,yes yes yes yes yes and yes. I spend a good 15 mins staring at a text im about to make and then delete it because i figured im not worth her time

depression,fco2nc8,t3_ei5dzk,1577822924.0,"feel u man, got everything good in life and there's no reason to be sad. u hear other people in worse situations and u understand why they're depressed and sympathise with them. then there's us with no good reason"

depression,fcmyu9p,t3_ei28qn,1577798034.0,"Yup, in my experience, on days where I feel really down I don't have the energy for anything but the only thing that keeps me getting up is school lol."
depression,fckupmn,t1_fcku1vg,1577733596.0,"I have this friend that I had been talking to quote a lot, but it turned to a point of where I would talk to them everyday, and it would distract both me and her from normal stuff like schoolwork, etc. So  I have this slight paranoia of ""oh they don't have time or don't want to talk to me"" and so forth"
depression,fckucy3,t1_fckorjt,1577733379.0,"That is true, but I've always had this innate fear that when I tell my parents they won't take it well or won't take it seriously. Since I do quite well at school they have high expectations for me, so I don't want to ""disappoint""them, but also I don't want them to worry about me either. I've debated it quite a bit and never reached a conclusion."
depression,fckecg7,t3_eho3gc,1577723429.0,"YEAH, totally get u man. idek if im depressed or my mind is playing some sort of sick joke on me. if i cant even compose my thoughts to myself, how am i meant to do it to someone else. and a problem ive found is that for me, when i do open up to someone, they become the only person i open up to and i talk to them regularly, up until the point where i think im bothering them and they dont want to talk to me. Even if its not true, ill make myself believe it. Anyway im kind of ranting here, sorry lol, but yeah ur not alone"
