AskPhysics,ffh6ye2,t3_etdznu,1579924839.0,"[Spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime) is the background that fields exist on, and subatomic particles are excitations of those fields. Mass and energy affect the shape of the surrounding spacetime, producing the effect we know as gravity. 

The exact shape of the spacetime (including how far away events are in space and time, and the paths that objects follow in the absence of force) is described by the [metric tensor field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity\)), the relativistic version of the gravitational field. The math on that wiki page looks complicated (and it is), but it's almost the same kind of math used to describe the shape of any curved surface. In this case one of the directions along the surface is time, which is almost like a spatial direction but not quite.

The path of an object traces out a curve in spacetime called a [worldline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line), each of the points on the curve corresponding to the position of the object at a particular time. The velocity of the object at any point on this curve is determined by the tangent vector to this curve, the direction in spacetime the curve leaves that point. Breaking down this vector into components requires a coordinate system that will depend on the chosen frame of reference, which is why velocity (the spatial components divided by the time component) depends on reference frame."
AskPhysics,ffb8g38,t1_ff9zpt5,1579754938.0,"The spatial Fourier transform gives you the momentum-space wavefunction, f(p,t). Then |f(p)|^2 is the probability density for momentum states, so to get a probability that the momentum is within some range you'd integrate the density over that range. It's just like how you'd integrate |psi(x)|^2 over a range of x to get the probability that the particle will be found in that region. 

The momentum eigenstates (for which f(p) is nonzero only at one specific p value) are not usually going to be stationary states, they are just the states that are eigenstates of the x derivative (stationary states are eigenstates of the t derivative). They are only stationary states for the case of a free particle (constant zero potential). 

The stationary states are always energy eigenstates, given by the time independent schrodinger equation. It's harder to calculate what these are since it depends on the potential that is used in each scenario, but once you know what they are it can make it easier to analyze how the wave changes over time by breaking it down into a sum of energy eigenstates."

As you speed up, gravity stays (roughly) the same, while the drag force continues to increase due to your increasing speed. The total force is the sum of the gravity downward and the drag upward, and that force determines how fast you accelerate. 

Terminal velocity is the velocity that produces an amount of drag force on an object equal to the gravitational force on that object. At this point the total force is zero, which means that you won't accelerate any faster, and you stay at the same speed from then on.

It's not taken for granted, but it would be in your best interest to take it for granted for now until you learn more. You can't use predictions of quantum field theory like vacuum fluctuations to argue against foundational principles of the same theory (constancy of a maximum speed).

The vacuum is not a medium, light travels in the electromagnetic field which does not act like any medium you're familiar with. The presence of vacuum fluctuations (what is commonly and incorrectly referred to as particles popping in and out of existence) doesn't make light any slower. Even with that effect it's still completely massless and for that reason it travels at the maximum possible speed. There's no need for any further correction, it's already going as fast as it can."
AskPhysics,feigjku,t1_feidsf7,1579138016.0,"I'm the last person to ask about error propagation tbh. 

All I can say is that this problem is caused by the fact that only two values are being considered instead of the range of values in between. The formulas work just fine for those two values, what breaks is the assumption that if a<b<c, then either f(a)<f(b)<f(c) or f(a)>f(b)>f(c). This isn't true if the function has a local maximum or minimum between a and c. Sine and cosine have local extrema at the quandrant boundaries, so that's why you have to be careful. 

You could just plug in all the values in between to find the true max and min of your range. That's effectively what you're doing by graphing the function between your max and min input values. There's no easy general formula for it, the endpoint values just get overridden if there is a lower minimum or higher maximum in that region."
AskPhysics,feif8jy,t1_feibiwq,1579137139.0,"Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^(2)

gravitational potential energy is mgh, h being the height above some reference level (usually the ground, but in this case you could choose the center of the circle, so the top would be a height of +r and the bottom would be a height of -r). g is gravitational acceleration, equal to 9.8 m/s^(2)

Conservation of energy means that the total energy (sum of kinetic and potential) is the same at the top and bottom, because no energy was transferred to or from the system. We can write out the total energy at the top and set it equal to the energy at the bottom:

(1/2)m(v_top)^2 + mg(r) = (1/2)m(v_bottom)^2 + mg(-r)

you're given m, r, and v_top, so you can solve for v_bottom

Vertical acceleration just means the vertical component of acceleration. Acceleration is a vector, and you can always break a vector up into a sum of component vectors that are purely horizontal or purely vertical. In this case we care about the vertical component because tension and gravity are both vertical, and there are no horizontal forces (at least at the top and bottom). 

For your FBD of the bottom, the forces are in the vertical direction (tension up and gravity down). The sum of these forces (the net vertical force) is what you plug into F=ma, the a is the centripetal acceleration given by v^(2)/r (it's a vertical acceleration because it points straight up towards the center of the circle).

cos(0±60^(o)) = .5 ± 0

It's true that the highest and lowest possible angles both have a cosine of .5, but the values in between have cosine of between .5 and 1. So the real answer would be .75±.25 instead. 

This is always an issue with functions that aren't monotonically increasing or decreasing.

A rotating frame is unnatural to use in this situation since the ball doesn't revolve at a constant speed. 

In circular motion, centripetal acceleration is the radial acceleration needed for the object to follow the curved path, and it's directed towards the center. The sum of all the radial forces divided by the mass have to be equal to v^(2)/r and directed inward for the mass to remain on the circular path."
AskPhysics,fei7mun,t3_ep6i40,1579132091.0,"Yes, that's all it means. Seeing them at the same location just means the position coordinates (in the observer frame) are the same, which means an object traveling in a straight line between them would be motionless relative to the observer. 

The simplest example is if the observer passes through both events without accelerating. Then the proper time between the events is the same as the difference in coordinate time the observer measures with their clock. 

Any observer at rest relative to the first observer would see their position as the same during both events and would measure the same time, so that's why the definition is more general."

There is a way of ""multiplying"" two vectors to get a scalar, called the dot product a·b. 

a·b=(length of a)\*(length of b)\*cos(the angle between them). 

If a and b are in the same direction, then the angle is zero and the cosine is 1, so the dot product would just be the product of the lengths of a and b. 

v·v is the dot product of v with itself (both are clearly in the same direction), and the length of v is the speed. So v·v is equal to (speed)\*(speed), or speed^(2).

An object on a circular track experiences radial (centripetal) acceleration of v^(2)/r. When it's at the bottom this is also equal to the total vertical acceleration. The total vertical acceleration times the mass is the net vertical force, which includes tension upwards and gravity downwards.

Mass is the rest energy of a system (but in different units, E = mc^(2) is just to convert the units of energy to mass). Mass, energy, and momentum are closely related. 

Basically energy is a measure of how a system changes over time, momentum involves changes over space, and mass is a combination of those two that is the same in any frame of reference. 

The reason that physical systems behave like that is either from an action principle or the schrodinger equation (also closely related), which there is no known justification for as far as I know.

She says besides this things are predetermined, but it’s not really something worth worrying too much about.

Branching only happens when something on a small scale affects something, which affects something else, etc. If it truly affects nothing then it won't branch. Small scale events affect large events all the time, they just mostly (but not always) get lost in the noise. 

The branching is deterministic overall, it's the fact that we can't tell which branch we're on that causes the appearance of randomness. The probability of being in a particular branch isn't equal on all branches, but every world that's allowed by the laws of physics does exist. 

A lot of the things we consider deterministic are just things that happen in the vast vast majority of possible worlds, but there are rare exceptions. You just shouldn't expect them to happen in any given world even if you waited longer than many times the age of the universe.

Absolutely. The theory doesn't explicitly involve observers, it uses the standard rules of quantum mechanics (the Schrodinger equation) to describe how the wave function of the universe constantly splits or ""branches"" into multiple self-consistent parts, or worlds. This happens whenever interactions between physical systems produces effectively irreversible entanglement between them (aka quantum decoherence).

An observer would be anything that measures or records a property of some system, by physically interacting with it. Because quantum systems can be in superposition, this usually produces different measured outcomes in different worlds, which appears to us as quantum randomness."

The aether is supposed to be a background of stuff that other things move through.

In other words, a special frame of reference that moves with it that other things can be compared to.

Such a special frame of reference does not exist, instead we have a principle of relativity which states that the laws of physics are the same in a wide variety of different reference frames in different states of motion. This principle is one of the most solidly verified experimental facts in science. 

The theory of relativity is a mathematical framework for describing physical systems that is built on that principle, and modern physics with all of its experimental successes has been based on it for about a century.

You can define a generalized past, present, and future for any observer corresponding to their past lightcone, spacelike separated region, and future lightcone respectively. But this is relative to the observer, and no observer can consider themselves to be living in the ""now"" more than any other.

A tensor is a multilinear map, a function that takes in some number of vectors and outputs a number. ""multilinear"" just means that f(A + B) = f(A) + f(B) for any input vectors A and B. This is useful because to know what this function does to any vector, all you need to know is what it does to the basis vectors (for example, unit vectors along the x,y, and z axis). Then the result for any given vector can be calculated by breaking that vector down into basis vectors, running each of those through the function, then adding the results back up to get the final answer. 

A matrix is an example of a rank 2 tensor, because to get a single number out of it you have to input 2 vectors. The rows and columns of a matrix are a summary of what it does to each possible combination of basis vectors that you can give it. Multiplying that matrix by one vector gives you a rank 1 tensor, the output vector. To get a single number out of that output vector you have to give it a direction (some basis vector) to get the component of the vector along that direction. 

For the moment of inertia tensor, you input the angular velocity of the object as a vector, and another unit vector in some direction, and the function tells you how much angular momentum the object has in that direction. If you do this 3 times giving it the x,y, and z basis vectors, you get the components of the full angular momentum vector."

The L1 point is where the earth's gravity, sun's gravity, and centrifugal force balance exactly (for a stationary object without coriolis force).

In the rest frame of the traveling twin, they send out signals every year. For the twin that stays still, the time between the emission of signals is longer due to time dilation. But the time between receptions of the signal is even longer than that because each subsequent signal is sent at a further location in space and takes longer to reach the other twin. 

When the twin turns around, the emissions are still slow due to time dilation, but because every subsequent emission happens closer and closer, the time between receptions is shortened. 

This applies not only to the frequency of the light (determined by the time it takes for each peak and trough of the light wave to pass by you) but to any period of time that you measure by intercepting light signals emitted from the events you're observing (so a clock would appear slow or fast based on the light you see from it). 

The travel time of light does not matter in the [Einstein synchronization of clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_synchronisation), which is how the time coordinate is defined in each reference frame (and how time dilation of one reference frame compared to another is defined). This is because events are labeled by the time read on clocks that are at the same time and place as the event (and moving along with the reference frame), which means there is no delay between the event and the measured time coordinate of the event. But the timing of light signals far away does depend on the relative motion of the emitter and receiver."
