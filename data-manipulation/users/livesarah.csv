I love your picture (and that you still have it). My 5yo daughter loves to draw too, sometimes while I’m doing her hair, and I especially love her self-portraits :)"

MedicalGore,fg2tqhz,t1_fg1vbuo,1580455518.0,"My first baby was 5.44kg (12lb)and the midwives were super curious to weigh my placenta- it was 2.2kg (4.85lb according to google). It explained why I felt so HUGE and tired so early in my pregnancy, when the baby is supposedly minuscule, as the placenta finishes growing around 16-18 weeks (from memory). It was like having all the life sucked out of me for 9 months but it made sense when he was born (and made me feel very justified at being miffed when I was  told “every first-time pregnant lady feels like their baby is really enormous”. Even just the placenta was almost the weight of a normal baby!"

This photo is no exception!"
trashy,fftaytw,t1_ffspl19,1580214917.0,"Also no one has yet mentioned the red marks on the kid’s tummy from the scrubbing? Who cares about the writing, it’s better to leave it to come off over time than scrubbing your baby’s skin red raw!"
Art,fft9kec,t3_ev27gs,1580213441.0,"I didn’t expect to like this so much. In spite of the trippy colours it looks so lifelike. Beautiful! I’m going to show it to my 5yo daughter, who fancies herself a serious artist- I know she will love it!"
LifeProTips,ffhy8kd,t1_ffffvkh,1579959032.0,I’ve always wondered! I have a super common first name and a very uncommon surname- I’ve only ever come across another one ‘in the wild’ here in Australia once. And there are only 4 people with my name combo in the US according to that site.
LifeProTips,ffhxptz,t3_etb8je,1579958454.0,"I’m Australian and we have a fair few kiwis living here. I had to urge my husband to think of another name for our first born son when I imagined how the traditional ‘first born son’ name he’d been thinking of would sound when pronounced with a kiwi accent (like a slang term for boobs).

I googled heavily for the shortened version of my second son’s (also traditional) name - it is a legit boy’s name across several disparate cultures (with different meanings in each)- but I did not realise until I started learning Spanish with Duolingo that it also sounds very much like the Spanish word for ‘Dinner’!"
MedicalGore,ffhrer7,t1_ffhirsr,1579949944.0,"Wowwww scary that it was in there so long! When you say it only spread to a few organs, do you mean it was malignant or that it just got so physically large it kind of invaded them?"
SandersForPresident,ffbqbbc,t1_ffb8350,1579778372.0,"Women AND girls, if I recall correctly. I was pretty blown away when I saw it, just how many of them there are and how blatant he could be and get away with it."
brisbane,fext0r4,t1_feu8bq3,1579435593.0,"It doesn’t always work that way though. I’ve shared a 9yo article on the bigoted leanings of the Maleny Dairies owners, Ross Hopper and family from the Sunshine Coast Daily News a bunch of times in recent days, including on FB news feeds for a couple of media outlets. All of a sudden, in the last 24-48 hours it has been paywalled, after being free for the last 9 years. So there’s no guarantee that a linked article will be free at the time someone clicks on it, regardless of whether it was free when it was posted."
gifs,fexg9hy,t1_fewq8ff,1579430497.0,Is it claustrophobia? Because I’m not claustrophobic at all but watching that video gave me a sense of rising panic. I was wondering if there is a special word for the fear of getting snowed in/trapped by snow... I’ve never really seen snow but that looks kind of terrifying!
news,fevc3ay,t1_fetqfgt,1579395642.0,"I had a pretty cool teacher in high school who used to travel to Asia a lot. We loved him because he was good natured and would give out Asian lollies for correct answers in class (in a terribly boring, racist, white-bread country town in Australia in the years before such things could be ordered over the internet this was pretty magical).

Years later I found out from a mutual friend of my mum’s and his that he was a single gay man (all the gay teachers at my school were single while I was there as it was too hard to live as an openly gay person). But I also found out he travelled to SE Asian countries twice a year, and  I haven’t been able to think the same about him since, knowing what Australian paedophiles get away with over there (often with the knowledge of authorities here). He might be a good person who likes to travel to an amazing part of the world that he loves and can do so regularly because he isn’t saddled with a family, but damned if I don’t give the side eye to ANY man who goes there on his own on a regular basis. Knowing what goes on there has poisoned it for me."
whatsthisplant,fernjvx,t1_fer8mal,1579356151.0,My first first thought was that it could be a relative. Apparently we are both wrong but I think it was a good guess!
mildlyinteresting,fern9s3,t3_eqfduy,1579356048.0,Has no-one suggested posting this on r/mildlypenis yet?
Naturalhair,feqz6co,t3_eqbvzi,1579347770.0,I bought an adult sized one for my 5yo daughter and it just barely covers her head- in fact it is SMALLER than the kid-sized one I bought for my son. I’m following for some good suggestions because even my kids marvelled at how bad the most recent one is!
CozyPlaces,feqozjs,t1_femfuci,1579344426.0,Cool! I’ve only been to the Bunya Mountains once but it is a stunning area. Feels so ancient and remote despite not being terribly far from Brisbane :)
brisbane,feqoox6,t1_femhszs,1579344306.0,"Rather orange-y red. It might be close to the shade of the bowl at the front, I think, or the bowl at far left.  If you like I can take a look when I’m next on-site and ask the builder about the prospect of collecting some- there’s probably enough to get a 20L bucket full I guess? Builder will probably think we are both nuts but this is actually a really cool project!"

news,fepyrw1,t1_fep9eph,1579334864.0,"I think there might be a bit less stigma associated with digestive functions. When my roommate got terrible food poisoning one day, she was very detailed when recounting her bowel movements to me after she got out of hospital. Very matter-of-fact. I don’t think it’s a bad thing, but when you’ve been raised in a culture that does the opposite it’s confronting."

loseit,fed22qc,t1_fecaf56,1578994836.0,"They will help with satiety, micronutrients that your body may well be lacking after years of poor diet, and protein and fibre along with the ‘good fats’. Don’t feel like you need to use them too sparingly, they are excellent plant-based foods to include in a healthy diet! A little extra-virgin olive oil on your salads is a good thing for your body, too. It will help those bucket-loads of leaves go down in an enjoyable fashion. You’re nurturing your body, not punishing it :)"

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdsetq3,t1_fds87xr,1578701088.0,"Stop with the straw man, the British Museum stole and disrespected the remains of many different people from cultures all over the world. They have been shamed into returning the remains of indigenous Australians only in the last few years. They are thieves."
TheWayWeWere,fds8vpc,t1_fdrpkjk,1578697013.0,I’ve read enough old recipes to know that bland British food predates any of the world wars.
todayilearned,fdpg93a,t1_fdpbukx,1578627833.0,"My husband is just like this. I ate traditional food in his parents‘ country and he lived off packets of biscuits and sliced white bread. And when we went to Malaysia he felt he had done his bit to eat local food by ordering a burger from Hungry Jacks that had black pepper sauce (instead of whatever it is they put on burgers in Australia). He never tires of telling me that if we travel overseas I’m at a much higher risk for horrible diarrhoea diseases, while he is ‘protected’ by his terrible diet!"

That said, when my kids first started watching it I assumed from the little I saw that it was puerile and silly, like a lot of kid’s shows. I’m quite fond of it now, after paying a bit more attention to the content (although I feel the writing has gotten lazier in the last couple of seasons)."
