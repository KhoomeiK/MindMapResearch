UCI,ffsuh9l,t3_ev01yu,1580192950.0,"It just sounds like you're scared of not knowing the full picture/scale of the virus and that fear is keeping you from being able to focus. 

The virus is on par with the flu -- if you're in poor health, it is something to worry about. But since we're young adults our health is very exceptional. That doesn't just mean that you will experience very light symptoms, rather you may not even experience symptoms at all (i.e. not get sick). We're still in flu season. It happens every year and even in previous years students came and went as usual regardless of how many were infected. 

And seeing so many people cough/sneeze is likely a confirmation bias you have in your paranoia. Normally you'd dismiss someone clearing their throat or allergy sneezes but it seems like your mind is wandering off to the virus possibility. It doesn't help that the media has been milking the crap out of the virus by using headlines such as ""lethal"" and ""death toll"" for something that has barely killed anyone for how widespread people are perceiving it to be. The flu is more widespread and kills even more and nobody gives a crap.

I can't change whether you feel safe at school or not, but I'll just be another voice that says people are taking it way too seriously and you can choose whether or not to believe it."
UCI,ffstzw5,t3_ev0zsb,1580192423.0,"I wore a mask because I had a slight cough and I didn't want to transmit disease. Keep in mind that it's flu season.

Some people are (overly) paranoid about the virus. Depending on what you do at the arc, it might not be advisable to wear a mask. If you're not used to breathing stuffy air, it might be best to do rather light exercises when you are wearing one. 

Regardless, nobody will judge you for wearing a mask. I wouldn't become surprised if it starts being in fashion."
UCI,ffstfb2,t1_ffssuqr,1580191802.0,"Yep, and I definitely won't argue against that possibility.

UCI,ffst915,t3_euutpm,1580191621.0,"I'm going to try to introduce a different point of view to your issue. I think that there's the possibility that you aren't feeling complete burnout as much as you are experiencing the stress of the increased workload/pressure from UCI. 

  
Are you unable to find motivation to do work because you didn't perform as well as you hoped in the last quarter? It can lead to a bad spiral of self doubt/demotivation. Remember that one quarter's worth of GPA will not hurt you very much in the long run, especially this early in the game. It's common.

Are you finding it hard to understand the homework or taking so long to complete it that you are sick and tired of sitting around and slowly figuring out? People tend to be more motivated to complete work when they actually have an idea of how to do it. LARC, office hours, and study groups can help with that.

UCI,ffssgu0,t1_ffrpzbe,1580190814.0,"This just sounds more like a placebo. Judging by his character (especially the homeopathic stuff, which is pseudoscience crap) he's pretty likely to turn small things into a really big deal.

The big things that tick me off is that both you and the person don't seem very composed about this, and I guess I can't blame you. However, being resentful towards ""mainlanders"" and him just talking about the corona virus aren't symptoms. The big list of ""evidence"" seems to be doing more to scare you other than consolidating possible symptoms.

The only symptoms we have to go off of are that he has had a cough for a long time, he's been snoring (since when? Snoring can be cause by a whole plethora of causes), he ""sounds like he's dying"", and you think he doesn't know he's had a fever because he has been tired. If he has had the virus for so long, you more than likely would've gotten sick. And it seems like you aren't. Honestly, it sounds like the whole homeopathy stuff has been catching up to him, especially as a result of travelling to a foreign country (with different weather and bacteria there that he likely hasn't grown used to).

You should report him not because you think he has the corona virus but because if he maintains this condition and you have a period of stressful times it increases your chances of catching what's more likely a mild disease. Contact your RA or CA to report it. And most importantly calm down and don't lose your mind over what you're worried could happen."

A good LA would check your answers, but I get the feeling that he doesn't. In a sense, they're really only there to take attendance and make sure yall aren't breaking anything.

&#x200B;

If your labs were like ours, they taught content ahead of the class, which is difficult. The important takeaways (in my opinion) are the equations. The exercises mostly aim to give visual evidence and representation to the concepts talked in class, which are centered around equations. If you can feel comfortable with equations, not being sure with instructions is okay in the grand scheme of things. As a physics major still doing lab stuff, I still find it difficult to know what I need to do even if I've read the manual.

I know someone who has been tutoring students for several years and he says that hard work has always trumped over ""intelligence"". He has never seen someone who is motivated to learn and improve not succeed.

Comparing yourself to others is something you'll have to learn to stop doing because it takes away from you focusing on yourself -- and how to improve yourself. Obviously, it isn't going to happen immediately. However, it's something you can overcome.
