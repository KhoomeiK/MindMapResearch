Some hostels have rules against laundry, since it can bother others especially in a dorm (or maybe they have a laundry service they'd rather you pay them for). In a private room though it should be fine since it can't bother anyone. Try to find a sunny spot next to the window. As a side note I usually stay in a dorm and still do laundry sometimes, unless there is an explicit rule against it. If the weather is good then hanging outside would be more effective, some hostels even have laundry lines that you may be able to use (you can ask if you want to be sure).

Again though in my opinion doing hand laundry is hardly worth the time or effort. And there are more effective ways to save money such as staying in shared dorms or cooking some of your own meals."

solotravel,fee9m0q,t3_eojdqp,1579029236.0,"Laundry services are usually easy to find and not very expensive. Many are full-service as well so you just hand them your laundry bag and get clean, folded laundry a few hours to a day later.

Now I sometimes do laundry by hand because I try to shoestring where I can, but to be honest it doesn't save me a significant amount of money. Even if paying for laundry every week it should only be about US$20 a month.

When doing hand laundry I make sure I am staying in a place for at least 2 nights (so they have time to dry) and have some sort of space to hang them (I improvise often).

Also having a few quick-drying clothes helps, this is one of the reasons some   people like to use Merino wool (and supposedly it doesn't need laundry as often either); Merino is too expensive for me, most of my clothes are just cotton which takes quite a while to dry - however my Dri-FIT shirt, zip-off travel pants and travel towel are all fast-drying.

If travelling under two weeks I tend to just pack everything I'd need. Otherwise I pack for 7 days and do laundry once a week (usually hand laundry every other week just to save a few bucks)."

solotravel,fe6l6uw,t1_fe6jv3f,1578894585.0,"Great questions mate.

Firstly I should note that I never actually tried Merino wool. I can't say anything about it other than the price which seems too high to me, but for all I know it's as good as they say and worth the hype. I'm still not going to spend that much on clothes, especially as I have a tendency to lose them while travelling.

I think a decent alternative to Merino wool though is Dri-FIT. They're breathable and quick drying sporty T-shirts, and pretty cheap as well; I would think so since all the Dri-FIT shirts I have are ones I got for free from sporting and other events. Having quick-drying zip-off style travel pants has also been useful for me (it's not Dri-FIT but a different material, can't tell you what...). I think quick-drying is an important quality, but indeed Merino wool is not the only material that has this.

Now for my top 3; indeed a quality backpack is something I consider important since it carries everything I have while travelling. As for packing cubes, they might not be necessary depending on your packing style, however it's likely you'll find them useful as did I; the good thing is you can find cheap ones which I think should be good enough - at the end of the day there's no reason a simple cube with a zipper should cost too much. Thirdly - layers! Well that depends on where you're travelling too, but assuming you're going to also head into somewhat colder climates you should come prepared; rather than having one massive heavy coat you want to have a few lighter things that you can layer to get as warm as you need. Investing in a foldable Uniqlo (or similar) jacket as well as a foldable raincoat can be worthwhile; also having thermal underwear - it doesn't have to be anything fancy, I just use long-johns I had lying around. Side-note: I ended up losing both my rain-coat and Uniqlo while travelling - I bought a new coat instead in a local travel goods outlet, which has served me well. This goes to show that even if you find you're missing something, it's quite likely you'll find what you need on the road - so don't worry too much about buying everything beforehand (and also don't overpack)."

Consider what you really need and what's most important for you.

On the other hand, Merino wool clothing - sounded cool but also needlessly expensive; I'm not going to spend that much on clothing just to potentially lose it in some laundry mix-up...

solotravel,fe5332f,t3_en4y4o,1578865209.0,"Why not both? Well that's what I did.

Last summer I worked as a camp counselor for two months, then flew to Central America for a month and from there continued to South America for another 5 months of travel. Flights between those were actually quite cheap.

I've always wanted to travel California as well. A popular trip there is renting a car then going on a road trip between the cities and national parks in the area; no doubt you'll meet friends at the camp who'll want to do the same and you could rent a car together. I thought about doing this although my camp was in New York (which I've already travelled in) and that would have required extra flights. I decided to head to Central America instead; either way the plan was to head down to South America after a month.

Now the USA is incredible and I still dream of seeing its stunning national parks, however travelling there is significantly more expensive than in Latin America. I immediately noticed the cheaper costs when getting to Central America, and then South America is even cheaper! I'd estimate travel costs in Latin America to be about half or even a third of North America (USA and Canada), at least in my experience.

As for my flight back home (the camp included  flights to NYC and back), I changed it to be back from Brazil. That change cost me money but not quite as much as buying a ticket back myself.
