DunderMifflin,fgq95uw,t1_fgpxeen,1581020188.0,And then after it got cut Pam was asking why they had to film it for real just to get cut? I think that episode was written and directed by Brian the boom guy.

xboxone,fglbz0s,t1_fgk6mvd,1580890075.0,I haven’t dated in a long time but my wife’s single friend was telling her how many dick pics she gets daily. I was genuinely surprised it was as many as that. I knew it happened but I didn’t know it was like that and thought it was something that might happen once.
instantkarma,fghl98g,t1_fgh4712,1580787376.0,But what if I have that concern because I’m already a self-entitled a-hole and I’m concerned he’s going to be better at it than I am?
PublicFreakout,fg7ieew,t1_fg792d1,1580593267.0,Yeah isn’t supposed to be the sole punishment but because of capitalism it has become the most profitable. Non-violent crimes should not result in prison for the most part. There’s always different circumstances but mostly we should be using non-violent criminals to do other things in the community.

wholesomememes,fg7e87x,t1_fg7d59p,1580590365.0,Yeah that makes sense because of rivalry. 49ers have always been my second favorite team but I e also historically liked the Chiefs as well.

dankmemes,ffphxct,t1_ffpdq8d,1580095466.0,Somehow I came to the impression there was an editor feature that could update to past tense as a feature for higher level editors. I guess I read it or saw it on Reddit or someone lied to me idk but it makes sense they would have a feature that could do it quickly.
tifu,ffmq0bm,t1_ffm6xcx,1580057765.0,I had my first not long ago and it was excruciating. Like OP I was rendered completely immobile. The headache itself was building a little during sex and that wasn’t normal but it just made me want to finish faster. Bad idea. If that ever happens again I now know just stopping is a million times better than hitting that orgasm and taking that headache.
todayilearned,ffmlwtz,t1_ffm867e,1580056457.0,"I’m also a developer and I like the open team space but not the open office space for everyone in the company. I’ve been management for a long while now. I’m also extrovert. 

Going back to my last production development job was an open team space and it was fine. My last job I spent 5 years with my own office. Before and after that I was remote for years. Now I’m back in an office but I’m also with the team in an open space. I love remote and I love open team space. Both have their pros and cons for me. I really like going into the office though and seeing, taking, and meeting directly with people. I also enjoyed the freedom of remote to work GoW and when I wanted. The only purpose of the personal office I had for years was the symbol of management. It probably did protect my team from me telling to them all the time lol."
Showerthoughts,ffja4ws,t1_ffj3mv4,1579993996.0,At the end his entire speech is about how he doesn’t know if he’s the one who emerges from the other side or not. People are always trying to debate that.
Showerthoughts,ffis6y4,t1_ffipkoy,1579981384.0,"It’s a good movie until you realize the gaping plot hole that ruins the entire consideration part of the movie. Idk how to put spoiler tags on mobile but I’ll update with the spoiler if I see how.

E: I guess what it says the spoiler formatting is doesn’t work on the mobile app. Oh well don’t read if you don’t want a spoiler. 

>!Spoiler:

There’s two machines A and B. 

Early in the movie guy goes in machine A. After the process there’s no two versions of the guy. One in machine A and one in B. After they come out, the version from machine A shoots and kills the version from machine B. 

We have this info but we don’t know which is the real him. Possibilities:

Original goes in machine A, a copy is made in machine B, original remains in machine A. 

Second possibility, original goes in machine A, is transported to machine B, and a copy of him is left in machine A. 

If we assume the first possibility, the original is alive at the end of this process and the copy is killed. If we assume the second, the original is killed. 

Later in the movie, it is revealed the guy is murdering the version left in machine A. 

If we use the first possibility above, the original survives the test and is killed when he starts murdering the machine A version. 

If we use the second possibility, we already know the original is killed after the test. 

Therefore, there is no scenario where the original is alive at the end of the movie. !<"

How should we handle situations where individuals were sent to prison for weed and then while in prison they commit other offenses like assault etc and receive additional sentencing? It’s to be argued the state put them in the position to commit those additional offenses."

WritingPrompts,fetnfik,t1_fetk7iz,1579377194.0,No it’s probably dead. I’ve written probably 10 half books and have only ever finished 2. It takes too much from me and I lose confidence which then leads to losing interest. Couple that with too little time for all hobbies and it’s a recipe to having a lot of unfinished stuff.
WritingPrompts,fesywmr,t1_feqrrbv,1579370293.0,"Crazy how people have the same ideas about 10-15 years ago I wrote about half a book similar to this concept. Instead of 1,000 kidnapped, the aliens used something I called at the time space-phasing to move Earth to a new galaxy that was near a cluster of planets of peaceful alien races. The planets were close enough you could see and easily travel to and from. Using the space-phasing tech the aliens had engineered the solar system to align with each planets needs so some aliens required a little closer to their star etc. 

The Earth was actually facing a mass extinction event from a meteor so they agreed to be space-phased to the new system and in return they would provide military protection from an outside group of aliens who were spreading across the galaxy. The space-phasing aliens had evolved to be more science minded and required more base minds to run military operations. 

Full of holes all over but I never did finish it. I think it even turned out the peaceful aliens had engineered the meteor in order to ensure humans accepted the offer. Idk."

videos,fdmep50,t1_fdm31r4,1578547445.0,"It’s not even he rapes but he saves situation. It’s more about the moral discussion and acceptance/rejection of the quid pro quo. The idea of the casting couch has been around for decades and many people then and even today don’t think there’s anything wrong with it let alone those people considering it rape. They simply don’t. There’s even a famous porn studio making tons of movies based on the casting couch idea. The problem arises because the choice is given despite the choice being much bigger than “will you have sexual with me?” It’s “do you want to have a career” or “do you want tour dream to crumble?” Even if you phrase it like that there still going to be people who say it’s still a choice. 

So I don’t think it’s people ignoring raping to enjoy movies. It’s really people ignoring what they consider an ok choice to enjoy movies."
