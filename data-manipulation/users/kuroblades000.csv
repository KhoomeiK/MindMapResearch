depression,fejj1a4,t1_fejbnqt,1579176357.0,"Same. It feels like a never-ending loop going on with thoughts of ""I can't suddenly off myself yet, I'm still working"" and other days has been very tiring to the point of ""I don't want to do this anymore. I hate myself. I want to end myself."""
depression,feivh3j,t3_ep4bw6,1579148315.0,"I feel the same. Now that I'm still alive, I'm just doing whatever I'm told to do enough that would keep me good financially. Day by day it's the same feeling and thoughts etc.. why am I still here? Why haven't I off myself? I don't deserve this."
depression,fegeakz,t3_eovzz6,1579089730.0,It's like all the years of depression suddenly VaNiShEd!!
depression,fdh0bkf,t3_ekwbox,1578412588.0,It has probably been about almost 15 years since I had this feeling although it would be on and off throughout the years. I'm in my 20s. I got depressed and started hating myself for existing. I would think that the world and the people close to me would be better without me.
