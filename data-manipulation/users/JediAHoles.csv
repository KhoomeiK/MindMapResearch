depression,fczbxre,t3_ejnol5,1578097827.0,"I've spent my entire Christmas break just worrying about school and not actually studying anything meaningful. I have my final exam in physics next Friday, and I dont understand physics at all. I didn't have physics at high school and now I'm expected to understand uni level physics... no idea where to begin. I'll probably end up dropping out anyway, since dealing with everything just makes me sick. So I'm kinda giving up on school right now. And it hurts like hell, because until now, being a ""good student"" was my only goal in life. Which lead to me wasting my teenage years but that's a different story"
depression,fczbfr6,t1_fcz5kgq,1578097538.0,Great advice! Just personally I despise the sunshine. It tires me and just makes everything look much worse imo. The mess in my room (and life for that matter lmao) is less obtrusive when the sun has set.
