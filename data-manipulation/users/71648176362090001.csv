DotA2,ffi2ku4,t1_ffi1gqx,1579963229.0,Puppey id the better drafter Overall. Kuros drafts are not considtent sadly. One game theyjudt straight destroy the enemy with the draft the next they get outdrafted hard. Problem id also that the last one happens too often. Maybe more Practice After the major will make them more better and less one dimensional
