You only need to worry about it if you have discharge, white is normal, a funky smell, burning when peeing, or just general pain or discomfort. Then you see your doctor. Just know that all vaginas smell. It’s not a bad thing. They all have a scent and there’s nothing you can do about it."

mentalhealth,ffjypby,t1_ffjyery,1580010615.0,"Well what were you looking for? That’s literally what causes PTSD. As for treatment, therapy is always a great option. One of them being EMDR therapy."

TrueOffMyChest,ffhp418,t3_etope1,1579946380.0,"I’m so sorry you feel this way. Just remember that just because you think you don’t you have valid reasons for being depressed, doesn’t invalidate your feelings. Depression has a tendency to not make sense.

TrueOffMyChest,ffhnxoa,t1_ffhnuzg,1579944564.0,"I have PTSD from a few things that happened to me in my childhood. It really sucks because of the stigma about PTSD only happening, or being valid, for military."
mentalhealth,ffhnw7q,t1_ffhnqgo,1579944504.0,"Yeah, definitely try therapy. But don’t just give up after a few sessions because it doesn’t seem to be working. It takes time and you need to build a relationship with your therapist. Build that bond of trust and honesty."

TrueOffMyChest,ffhnr2f,t3_etnhdq,1579944285.0,"Yeah, definitely sounds like PTSD. I’d see a psychologist to confirm, then figure out a treatment plan from there. Therapy, maybe EMDR therapy specifically. It’s really good for people with PTSD."
