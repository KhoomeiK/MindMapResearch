trippinthroughtime,ffensal,t1_ffemqi6,1579856351.0,Raw opium is pretty unremarkable compared to heroin
hiphopheads,ffekw4j,t1_ffegxgu,1579852338.0,Exactly my thoughts smh
hiphopheads,ffee68w,t1_ffedtqa,1579844681.0,"It's really a great example of how easy it is for misinformation (or even something more nefarious like blatant lies) to be spread and quickly made more visible to users that don't know better. Reddit is a terrible place to try and disseminate information from, once bots see the initial up/down ratio and the rest of the bandwagoners come along suddenly folks will believe whatever has a positive score. 

It's weird because he probably called me a fucking retard useless crackhead about 42 times, told me to delete all my comments and delete my account, and said he was going to block me while subsequently responding to anything new I wrote.

This didn't throw up any red flags for anyone? Lol"
hiphopheads,ffedli8,t1_ffe6c83,1579844117.0,"Yeah, really weird to defend that position while linking equivalency charts and other irrelevant random info. We're talking about basically a single therapeutic dose of oxy vs the specified amount of naloxone to reverse an OD. If naloxone couldn't take hold of his receptors after less than a single oxycodone dose (much less a big shot of heroin or fentanyl) it wouldn't be effective at doing anything and we wouldn't even know about it because it would have failed any and all trials intended to prove its use."
hiphopheads,ffeddd4,t1_ffebs15,1579843900.0,"I'm sorry you feel that way, but if someone replies to my message I'm going to continue the dialogue most likely. Didn't meant to personally offend you by it."

hiphopheads,ffdn1ms,t1_ffdk1nb,1579824366.0,"Probably no one, I just want people to be aware of how easily they're goaded into thinking someone is being truthful or presenting new information just because there's a positive value at the top of their comment. 

So much speculation, misinformation, and blatant lying in this thread. It's to be expected but reddit users can be incredibly naieve. Not everyone on the internet is saavy (a surprise I know)."
hiphopheads,ffdfbch,t1_ffd8qm6,1579819677.0,Indeed
hiphopheads,ffd7ba6,t3_esyctd,1579814820.0,"I think it's hilarious that anyone cares, or worse, believes that the any award show could be 'fair' or 'transparent'. By design, they couldn't possibly. They aren't a public poll, and they're not based on any metric."
hiphopheads,ffd6m94,t1_ffbpm0r,1579814434.0,"I'm incredulous as to how my argument would trigger anyone. I suggested that his dosages were way off, then he linked various resources that didn't back up his argument in any way, or present any new relevant information to even suggest that they were right.

I guess my posts should have had some blue letters in them, then reactionary bandwagon riders looking to white knight an EMT with a dangerously poor undestanding of opioid overdose protoclol would be more likely to try and comprehend what I wrote."
