offmychest,fffb8ju,t3_et7o4i,1579880136.0," I don't work in MH, but I am a fellow health worker. Some of what we see in the course of our jobs just hollows us out. We work so hard to make the world a better place for the people we care for, yet our minds focus on the memories of the mistakes we made, the people who were unhappy with our actions, the patients we couldn't save. It is the great paradox of health care.

 I attended a lecture by a college professor and former police officer. He talked about a time when he and fellow first responders pulled two young men out of a manhole after they were overcome by CO. One lived, and the other didn't. He couldn't remember the name of the person he saved, but talked about the man who died at length, even reading from a letter from his parents. It was incredibly heartbreaking, still makes me tear up years later.

 Self care is absolutely vital for our emotional well being and sanity. Make sure you take time to do something special just for you each day, and especially after something like this has happened. Have a fat, juicy steak for dinner. Go see a movie. Spend time with loved ones. Buy yourself something nice that you've been thinking of. Be mindful of the signs of caregiver burnout, compassion fatigue, and PTSD. 

 I was once a single father, and did not have custodial rights to my child. His mother has CD issues, MH issues, and was very neglectful. It took me many years and many thousands of dollars to get custody and protect him from his mother, since the abuse and neglect he suffered was under the threshold for someone stepping in. He is already suffering the negative emotional effects of the things he experienced with her, and will for the rest of his life

 I'm someone who is incredibly grateful for heroes like you, with the courage to step in and save kids from their unfit parents. My own experience has shown me how horrible the situation needs to be before a child is removed from a parent's care. 

 God bless you, friend."

 The guy used to constantly dump work on me, until I was so overwhelmed that I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He would tell me ""just do it"". The promotion carrot was constantly dangled.  I caught him taking credit for things that I had done, when I was accidentally forwarded emails. He would take me to lunch, where he'd vent about people we worked with. I had a little one at home, and he knew I didn't have any other prospects, so he just didn't give a shit about my happiness at work. At all.

 Then when I gave notice, he came running back to my office, sobbing like a little girl. He said ""aren't we friends?"". What? I was stunned.

 When I had my exit interview, I came clean about what my work life was like. He had expected me to lie, and just tell HR I got a better opportunity somewhere else. He got pissed off, and wouldn't give me a reference. Fortunately, I changed careers, so it didn't hurt me, but it could have.

 One of my friends told me ""you need to be in a position where they need you a lot more than you need them"". That's the best career advice I've ever received. I will never let anyone back me into a corner at work ever again, and I urge you to take the same approach. 

 Cheers."
gretsch,ff67dg9,t3_ermr4v,1579620883.0," I have two 5420s with Bigsbys that get plenty of use. I had a bone nut installed on each, with the saddles angled toward the tuners. Everything else on them is stock, including tuners. I play hard. Tuning stability is stellar.

guitars,fewnbi2,t1_fewmnl6,1579415584.0,"  I found Tone Pros Klusons on eBay for $40. They dropped right in. There's a eBay seller that sells a Tone Pros tuneomatic bridge and stop bar tailpiece set for $77. These are really nice, because they're held together with set screws and are a lot more solid than the originals."
guitars,fewlx61,t1_few55yf,1579414069.0," I hear you man. I'm not in a hurry to change anything on mine. But being an Epi, I expected the hardware to be sub par, so I just started picking up parts as I found them. And I have yet to buy a newer guitar that had a really good nut on it, so I just replace those right away when I get the first setup done.

 For some reason, the gold plated hardware on the import stuff does not seem to go the distance, and it is surprisingly bad on this guitar. It's completely worn off the tops of the string saddles and the upper left corner of the bridge already.

 The other thing I have read about the pickups is, you can thin them out a little by lowering them all the way and just raising the pole pieces. I've tried it on the neck one and had a little success, but I definitely would like to try the staple.

guitars,few8ijz,t3_eq4ddb,1579406893.0," I think that's actually backwards- people buy online because the experience at the store leaves something to be desired.

 I wanted a Epi LPC Inspired by 1955. Nobody local had one. Tried to order through GC, got dicked around like crazy. They even tried to substitute a used return with a broken headstock for a small discount, much less than the repair would cost.

 I ended up going through an online retailer, and had a much better experience. If there was a solid local shop that carried guitars I could afford and wanted to play, I would go there. Unfortunately, that seems to be a bit much to ask these days."

 Nowadays, almost everything hanging there is in the $300-600 range, almost nothing used, and they're unplayable more often than not. My son likes going there and looking, but it has been a very long time since I have played anything cool at GC. I wish they had sick guitars in my area."
guitars,few4lad,t3_eqhecm,1579405274.0,What do you think about that Burny?
guitars,few2wzs,t3_eqds4g,1579404710.0," My Inspired by 1955 has been just fantastic. Hand built, long tenon, ebony board, medium jumbo frets, Gibson P90s, huge baseball bat neck, light weight and resonant (8 lbs). It's my main guitar now.

 Mine had major tuning issues when I first got it. I had a new bone nut and Tone Pros Kluson keys installed right away, and it has excellent stability now. The plating wore off the bridge after a few months of playing. I plan to install a Tone Pros bridge and aluminum stop bar next time I have it apart. I also plan to install the 'staple' neck pickup as mentioned by another poster, since the stock P90 is pretty wooly.

 How has your experience been with yours?"
Shitty_Car_Mods,fenkto8,t1_fenf3t4,1579286829.0, See my earlier comments.
guitars,fek6s9y,t3_epd5ps,1579193793.0," Very nice. I hope you enjoy it. The most important thing is that you like how it plays and sounds. A good musician can get a good tone out of pretty much anything, and doesn't waste time ragging on other people for what they play.

 I was a kind of a guitar snob when I was younger, but I have since learned that the cheaper stuff can be good, too. Nowadays, I pay more attention to the specs of a guitar than the name that's on it. I once owned a US '52 AVRI, and I still have a blonde '50s Reissue (almost it's twin) that I bought new in 2000.

 I just got a Classic Vibe 50's myself, that I picked up used for $260. I got it primarily to try out the modern fingerboard radius. It's been upgraded with good quality controls and an Electrosocket, because those are the weak points of that guitar. The bridge pickup is very bright, but I haven't spent enough time with it to decide what to do about it yet. It may end up with something a little darker, so it isn't such a contrast with my other guitars. It's a surprisingly well made guitar for what it is, and I get a lot of compliments on it. If I sanded off the Squier logo and stuck a Fender one on there, nobody would know the difference.

 The only thing with the Affinitys is, the neck wood doesn't seem to be cured as well as the more expensive models. I've seen a lot of them with twists and warpage over the years. My own Squier has a little twist to it, which I've been able to minimize with a truss rod adjustment, but it's still there. The electronics, switch, and jack are cheaper than cheap, but easily upgraded.

 Pardon my ramble. Cheers!"
Shitty_Car_Mods,fejk1k7,t1_fej047j,1579177460.0," I worked for a maintenance contractor for one of the major phone companies. I ran a crew of guys who went out and worked on their vehicles on-site during the off hours. There were something like 700 units housed around the greater metro area, and a lot of them were in private parking facilities. I just remember what a turd that van was to get around in, and it seemed like we were always having to watch the clearance. They were the tallest of their class, and I wished we had gone with Fords more than once. It's a major hassle when you spend a bunch of time tracking down a vehicle that needs work, then can't get to it because the stupid van is too tall."
Shitty_Car_Mods,feir4tx,t1_feinaez,1579145116.0," I actually did, and there were a few of them that didn't have enough clearance. I had to be careful in certain bank and restaurant drive throughs, too."
Shitty_Car_Mods,fegr22u,t3_ep2h7p,1579100530.0,"Not only does this look like shit, but it's completely impractical. That's a 1 ton cargo van, and already sits high enough to where you really have to watch your overhead clearance. I drove a G3500 like that for four years, and I'd have caught that wing on something in the first month."

Needafriend,fegpm7v,t3_eoz7et,1579099540.0," About 12 years ago, I lost everything like that. I managed to hang onto my job, but everything else was gone, and I was in a very dark place. I ended up driving a $500 car for awhile, and living in a crappy rented room while I got back on my feet. It took me about 18 months to really start feeling like things were under control again. I just put one foot in front of the other, and did what needed to be done, even on the days when I didn't even want to get out of bed. It was like that for a long time. I hadn't even scratched the surface at 5 months.

 It was a long, slow, frustrating process, but I eventually got my life sorted out. I felt like I was out of my comfort zone, a lot of the time. I went back to school, changed careers, got custody of my son, got married to the love of my life. Things are a lot better.

 You can PM me if you want, but there's really not much more to say than that. Someday, you'll look back, and it will all be just a distant, unhappy memory. Right now, it probably feels insurmountable. It's not."
relationships,fego9i6,t3_eoplvt,1579098581.0," People who want to spend time with you will find a way to do it. She sounds like someone who is a net emotional drain.

 I know a guy like this. We got along really well when we were younger, but things changed in his life. I know he is not happy, but he has made his own choices. He began doing things exactly like this. 

 The last straw for me was when he invited me to a guys' weekend, then ghosted me at the very last minute. I didn't tell him off or anything, but stopped making any kind of effort in the relationship with him, because I knew what it would get me. 

 Often times, people have a difficult time articulating their feelings, and will say one thing and then do something quite different. When I find myself in those situations, I have learned to disregard what they say, and instead focus on what their actions tell me. In this case, my friend was telling me he was done with our relationship. It sounds like your friend is telling you the same thing. It may be complicated by the fact that she enjoys getting attention and emotional support from you.

 I definitely wouldn't invite someone like this to participate in my wedding, or invest any more energy in the relationship. Let it rest, and see what happens in the next six months."

 I have owned a ES135 with P100s, a LP Special DC with P90s, and a 80s LP Standard with a factory Kahler. I really should have hung onto the last two, but you don't know what you don't know.

LesPaul,fe6aqcq,t1_fe63lf9,1578885646.0," I would agree. It looks like the same body shape as some of the Agiles. They're made in South Korea, though.

 I think there are some advantages to Gibson, depending on how much you spend. But having a G on the headstock is not a guarantee that the guitar isn't a turd. You have to spend a good chunk of cash on a Gibson to get good pickups, a long tenon, nice finish, etc. My buddy toured one of the plants, came back with horror stories.

  When I was in my early 20s, my then-girlfriend was looking at a Camaro SS. The salesman was a total ass, and among other things, wouldn't let me test drive the car. We told him if it was that big of a deal, we'd just go elsewhere. He encouraged us to do so.

 This was in an area where there were a lot of large car dealerships very close together. As we were leaving, we saw on the lot directly across the road (probably within sight of the other guy's office) a beautiful, almost brand new, Camaro Z28 convertible. They made her a deal she couldn't refuse. It was a great car, and a far better deal than the SS.

 Don't fall for the BMW hype over oil. BMW does not make oil. Definitely don't go as long as they tell you to go between services. They will also tell you that the transmission doesn't need to be serviced, which is a lie.

 I was working in my backyard one day, and I heard him playing football with the neighborhood kids in his yard, hanging out with them and giving them popsicles, just being a good neighbor. He's always like that...you'd never even know he's a cop unless you got to know him.

 Our community has a lot of drug and property crime. It is what it is. I know he's out there working with the bottom 1-2% of society, every single day. He keeps things compartmentalized. His family is wonderful, well adjusted, and happy, house immaculate, great kids in college.  

 If we had more great guys like you and my neighbor working in LE, the world would be a much better place. I am very distrustful of police, due to some of the things I've seen, but I know a good cop when I see one. I'm not out there yelling ACAB.

conspiracy,fdmr15n,t1_fdkfcii,1578561529.0,"  I'm not a commercial pilot, but I did do a little flying when I was working on my private pilot certificate.

 There is a phenomenon called ""ground effect"" we learn to utilize, during grass field takeoffs. Basically, when you're closer to the ground than the width of your wingspan, the aircraft floats at a speed much lower than that at which it will actually fly. 

 Let's say my minimum takeoff speed is 70 mph, but I can get into ground effect at 35 (just throwing those numbers out there). Because an unpaved landing strip causes so much more drag, I would get the aircraft up a few feet off the ground at 35, allow it to accelerate to 70, then climb out. 

 I don't know this for a fact, but I have read that the aerodynamic forces responsible for ground effect would prevent an aircraft of that size from even getting close enough to the ground at that speed to strike the Pentagon. 

 The other glaring issue I have seen with the Pentagon strike is, the total lack of environmental damage along the path of approach. It really should have looked like a tornado touched down outside the Pentagon. Even street lights which should have been directly in the path of the aircraft were undamaged. It just doesn't make any sense.

 So no, I don't think the turn and descent described would be a huge deal. But I don't see how the aircraft could have flown as fast and as low to the ground as it was said to, especially without damaging anything.

 And ALL of the CC camera footage from every single building that had cameras within miles of the Pentagon was confiscated by federal agents almost immediately. None of that footage has ever surfaced. Hmm."

And being Hyundai, it WILL break.

 RVing is a way to get us all out together to experience the world. If we allowed electronics and video games, that would be all the kids would want to do on our trips. They would have their faces in their screens, and be totally disengaged from us and the environment. 

 I told them that they could do this (pantomime using a game controller) exactly the same way at home on the couch, so why go through all the time and expense of running the RV only to have them do it there? I established that rule early, and I have never regretted it once. We're all forced to talk and interact, and it always works out for the best. I do all of the driving, and my family will often play board or card games, read books, and hang out together. On very long drives, I will sometimes run the generator so they can go in the back bedroom and watch a movie, but not often.

 For example, driving across Nebraska last year, we explored a little partially abandoned town. It looked interesting, and we cruised the side streets, looking around, talking about what life was like there and what could have caused it to end up how it was. We'd never have gotten their attention from their screens had we allowed that. 

 Our kids each have their little jobs to do when we get to our campsites. For example, I call one of my boys ""the mat master"", and the other is ""the awning master"". We all work together to set up, keep things running, and tear down. If something goes wrong, I try to get them out to help fix it. It's all a learning experience. I remind them how lucky we are to have a nice MH to travel in, and what a huge luxury it is. It's a very special time for all of us, well worth the hassle and expense."
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdelunv,t1_fde8zdi,1578341766.0," I've had experiences like that as well. Especially since I worked at a fleet shop where I was regularly forced for farm out work. I think the most egregious example was when the independent shop that PMed one of my 
E450 step vans sold us all of the low hanging fruit, including a fuel filter that was literally right next to the badly cracked rear leaf spring front hanger bracket (2 of 3 rivets not connected to the frame). And once I found it, and went back to express my displeasure, I was told that I shouldn't be upset because it was a hard vehicle to work on.

 But seriously, this all paled in comparison to the incompetence I witnessed at the oil change places. They do things like write procedures that require you to have six techs, but then only allow you to have three techs in the store, so no matter what you do, they are always cutting corners and on the verge of disaster. And that's assuming they even care about their jobs (most don't, since they're just glorified fast food workers that get treated like slaves).

 You can expect grease fittings to be missed or completely skipped, oil filters to be wiped off and reused instead of replaced, tires to be massively overinflated or not checked. All of the things they say they check for you? Nah. But you will 'need' a PCV valve, wiper blades, and an air filter every time you go, since those items are the low hanging fruit, and everything going into your car will be cheap trash. You'll be lucky if you get out of there with oil in your engine, a drain plug that's not stripped out, and the correct filter on and tight, and that is no exaggeration. 

 I can do exactly the same thing they do, in my driveway with hand tools, for about $20 worth of stuff from the store and in 15 minutes."
FullTiming,fdeh6wd,t3_ekx3t1,1578338945.0," I got our class A stuck in a driveway on some hunting property. We were fine going in, but severe weather turned the place into a muddy mess while we were there. I hired a heavy wrecker, who charged us about $250 to winch us out."
GoRVing,fdeg6gx,t3_ekxfwk,1578338320.0,"1. We've been RVing for about 6 years, and go out 5-10 times a year.

2. We have always loved camping. My wife really wanted to try RVing. We've only tent camped once since we got our first MH.

3. We weren't in a financial position to just go out and buy anything nice. We started off with an old pickup camper, and then a 1982 MH. We fixed them up ourselves (and learned a LOT along the way), then upgraded when we could.

4. RVing brings us together as a family in a way that is unique. We have a 'no electronics' rule with our kids, where we allow them to watch movies before bed, but there is no phone or video game use in the RV. There is nothing like going to a remote park in a different state, unwinding and just having a good time together. I love watching my wife relax in the passenger seat. She always looks so serene when we're on the road in our MH.

5. What sets the RV apart from a hotel, resort, etc., is that it's basically like bringing your house along with you. We only need to load it once when we leave, and once when we get home. We don't have to stop anywhere to eat or use the bathroom, and we're totally self contained once we get where we're going. And while we're underway, my family gets to be comfortable and hang out, just like we're at home.

6. I would agree with that sentiment. RVers have to be a little fearless, and not mind fixing things (because you'll be doing a lot of it). Having lots of disposable cash doesn't hurt."

guitars,fek6s9y,t3_epd5ps,1579193793.0," Very nice. I hope you enjoy it. The most important thing is that you like how it plays and sounds. A good musician can get a good tone out of pretty much anything, and doesn't waste time ragging on other people for what they play.

 I was a kind of a guitar snob when I was younger, but I have since learned that the cheaper stuff can be good, too. Nowadays, I pay more attention to the specs of a guitar than the name that's on it. I once owned a US '52 AVRI, and I still have a blonde '50s Reissue (almost it's twin) that I bought new in 2000.

 I just got a Classic Vibe 50's myself, that I picked up used for $260. I got it primarily to try out the modern fingerboard radius. It's been upgraded with good quality controls and an Electrosocket, because those are the weak points of that guitar. The bridge pickup is very bright, but I haven't spent enough time with it to decide what to do about it yet. It may end up with something a little darker, so it isn't such a contrast with my other guitars. It's a surprisingly well made guitar for what it is, and I get a lot of compliments on it. If I sanded off the Squier logo and stuck a Fender one on there, nobody would know the difference.

 The only thing with the Affinitys is, the neck wood doesn't seem to be cured as well as the more expensive models. I've seen a lot of them with twists and warpage over the years. My own Squier has a little twist to it, which I've been able to minimize with a truss rod adjustment, but it's still there. The electronics, switch, and jack are cheaper than cheap, but easily upgraded.

 Pardon my ramble. Cheers!"
Shitty_Car_Mods,fejk1k7,t1_fej047j,1579177460.0," I worked for a maintenance contractor for one of the major phone companies. I ran a crew of guys who went out and worked on their vehicles on-site during the off hours. There were something like 700 units housed around the greater metro area, and a lot of them were in private parking facilities. I just remember what a turd that van was to get around in, and it seemed like we were always having to watch the clearance. They were the tallest of their class, and I wished we had gone with Fords more than once. It's a major hassle when you spend a bunch of time tracking down a vehicle that needs work, then can't get to it because the stupid van is too tall."
Shitty_Car_Mods,feir4tx,t1_feinaez,1579145116.0," I actually did, and there were a few of them that didn't have enough clearance. I had to be careful in certain bank and restaurant drive throughs, too."

Needafriend,fegpm7v,t3_eoz7et,1579099540.0," About 12 years ago, I lost everything like that. I managed to hang onto my job, but everything else was gone, and I was in a very dark place. I ended up driving a $500 car for awhile, and living in a crappy rented room while I got back on my feet. It took me about 18 months to really start feeling like things were under control again. I just put one foot in front of the other, and did what needed to be done, even on the days when I didn't even want to get out of bed. It was like that for a long time. I hadn't even scratched the surface at 5 months.

 It was a long, slow, frustrating process, but I eventually got my life sorted out. I felt like I was out of my comfort zone, a lot of the time. I went back to school, changed careers, got custody of my son, got married to the love of my life. Things are a lot better.

 You can PM me if you want, but there's really not much more to say than that. Someday, you'll look back, and it will all be just a distant, unhappy memory. Right now, it probably feels insurmountable. It's not."
relationships,fego9i6,t3_eoplvt,1579098581.0," People who want to spend time with you will find a way to do it. She sounds like someone who is a net emotional drain.

 I know a guy like this. We got along really well when we were younger, but things changed in his life. I know he is not happy, but he has made his own choices. He began doing things exactly like this. 

 The last straw for me was when he invited me to a guys' weekend, then ghosted me at the very last minute. I didn't tell him off or anything, but stopped making any kind of effort in the relationship with him, because I knew what it would get me. 

 Often times, people have a difficult time articulating their feelings, and will say one thing and then do something quite different. When I find myself in those situations, I have learned to disregard what they say, and instead focus on what their actions tell me. In this case, my friend was telling me he was done with our relationship. It sounds like your friend is telling you the same thing. It may be complicated by the fact that she enjoys getting attention and emotional support from you.

 I definitely wouldn't invite someone like this to participate in my wedding, or invest any more energy in the relationship. Let it rest, and see what happens in the next six months."

 I have owned a ES135 with P100s, a LP Special DC with P90s, and a 80s LP Standard with a factory Kahler. I really should have hung onto the last two, but you don't know what you don't know. The neck was terrible on the Special, and I never really warmed up to the Standard, but they were cool guitars in their own right."
LesPaul,fe6aqcq,t1_fe63lf9,1578885646.0," I would agree. It looks like the same body shape as some of the Agiles. They're made in South Korea, though.

 I think there are some advantages to Gibson, depending on how much you spend. But having a G on the headstock is not a guarantee that the guitar isn't a turd. You have to spend a good chunk of cash on a Gibson to get good pickups, a long tenon, nice finish, etc. My buddy toured one of the plants, came back with horror stories.

 When I was looking for a Les Paul with P90s, the Gibson stuff starts at $2500. That is the 'cheapy' model. The middle of the road reissue is 6k, and the high end '55 Historic was almost 9k. Ouch."

TalesFromTheCustomer,fe50s3t,t1_fe41r3d,1578864623.0," LOL!

  When I was in my early 20s, my then-girlfriend was looking at a Camaro SS. The salesman was a total ass, and among other things, wouldn't let me test drive the car. We told him if it was that big of a deal, we'd just go elsewhere. He encouraged us to do so.

 This was in an area where there were a lot of large car dealerships very close together. As we were leaving, we saw on the lot directly across the road (probably within sight of the other guy's office) a beautiful, almost brand new, Camaro Z28 convertible. They made her a deal she couldn't refuse. It was a great car, and a far better deal than the SS.

 I had a 2008 R56S, and my wife drove a 2013.  We had them for years, no engine issues on either car (even in my failure-prone N14 engine). I have other BMW vehicles that I use this oil in, which have also never had any type of issues.

 Don't fall for the BMW hype over oil. BMW does not make oil. Definitely don't go as long as they tell you to go between services. They will also tell you that the transmission doesn't need to be serviced, which is a lie.

 A BMW service advisor once told me that BMW doesn't care about their customers after their warranty expires, and just wants to sell more vehicles. I believe it!"

 One of my former neighbors is an investigator for the sheriff's office. He's SUCH a good guy and does some great work for our community.

 I was working in my backyard one day, and I heard him playing football with the neighborhood kids in his yard, hanging out with them and giving them popsicles, just being a good neighbor. He's always like that...you'd never even know he's a cop unless you got to know him.

 Our community has a lot of drug and property crime. It is what it is. I know he's out there working with the bottom 1-2% of society, every single day. He keeps things compartmentalized. His family is wonderful, well adjusted, and happy, house immaculate, great kids in college.  

 If we had more great guys like you and my neighbor working in LE, the world would be a much better place. I am very distrustful of police, due to some of the things I've seen, but I know a good cop when I see one. I'm not out there yelling ACAB. I think a lot of people have fallen into that mindset because they feel powerless and that there is nothing left to lose.

 Just know that there are people out there who get it, as much as someone who doesn't work in LE can. I do really, really appreciate you."

 I admit that I didn't consider how bad 10 was in the Anoka area, during the time the stadium was being planned.

conspiracy,fdmr15n,t1_fdkfcii,1578561529.0,"  I'm not a commercial pilot, but I did do a little flying when I was working on my private pilot certificate.

 There is a phenomenon called ""ground effect"" we learn to utilize, during grass field takeoffs. Basically, when you're closer to the ground than the width of your wingspan, the aircraft floats at a speed much lower than that at which it will actually fly. 

 Let's say my minimum takeoff speed is 70 mph, but I can get into ground effect at 35 (just throwing those numbers out there). Because an unpaved landing strip causes so much more drag, I would get the aircraft up a few feet off the ground at 35, allow it to accelerate to 70, then climb out. 

 I don't know this for a fact, but I have read that the aerodynamic forces responsible for ground effect would prevent an aircraft of that size from even getting close enough to the ground at that speed to strike the Pentagon. 

 The other glaring issue I have seen with the Pentagon strike is, the total lack of environmental damage along the path of approach. It really should have looked like a tornado touched down outside the Pentagon. Even street lights which should have been directly in the path of the aircraft were undamaged. It just doesn't make any sense.

 So no, I don't think the turn and descent described would be a huge deal. But I don't see how the aircraft could have flown as fast and as low to the ground as it was said to, especially without damaging anything.

 And ALL of the CC camera footage from every single building that had cameras within miles of the Pentagon was confiscated by federal agents almost immediately. None of that footage has ever surfaced. Hmm."

 RVing is a way to get us all out together to experience the world. If we allowed electronics and video games, that would be all the kids would want to do on our trips. They would have their faces in their screens, and be totally disengaged from us and the environment. 

 I told them that they could do this (pantomime using a game controller) exactly the same way at home on the couch, so why go through all the time and expense of running the RV only to have them do it there? I established that rule early, and I have never regretted it once. We're all forced to talk and interact, and it always works out for the best. I do all of the driving, and my family will often play board or card games, read books, and hang out together. On very long drives, I will sometimes run the generator so they can go in the back bedroom and watch a movie, but not often.

 For example, driving across Nebraska last year, we explored a little partially abandoned town. It looked interesting, and we cruised the side streets, looking around, talking about what life was like there and what could have caused it to end up how it was. We'd never have gotten their attention from their screens had we allowed that. 

 Our kids each have their little jobs to do when we get to our campsites. For example, I call one of my boys ""the mat master"", and the other is ""the awning master"". We all work together to set up, keep things running, and tear down. If something goes wrong, I try to get them out to help fix it. It's all a learning experience. I remind them how lucky we are to have a nice MH to travel in, and what a huge luxury it is. It's a very special time for all of us, well worth the hassle and expense."
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdelunv,t1_fde8zdi,1578341766.0," I've had experiences like that as well. Especially since I worked at a fleet shop where I was regularly forced for farm out work. I think the most egregious example was when the independent shop that PMed one of my 
E450 step vans sold us all of the low hanging fruit, including a fuel filter that was literally right next to the badly cracked rear leaf spring front hanger bracket (2 of 3 rivets not connected to the frame). And once I found it, and went back to express my displeasure, I was told that I shouldn't be upset because it was a hard vehicle to work on.

 But seriously, this all paled in comparison to the incompetence I witnessed at the oil change places. They do things like write procedures that require you to have six techs, but then only allow you to have three techs in the store, so no matter what you do, they are always cutting corners and on the verge of disaster. And that's assuming they even care about their jobs (most don't, since they're just glorified fast food workers that get treated like slaves).

 You can expect grease fittings to be missed or completely skipped, oil filters to be wiped off and reused instead of replaced, tires to be massively overinflated or not checked. All of the things they say they check for you? Nah. But you will 'need' a PCV valve, wiper blades, and an air filter every time you go, since those items are the low hanging fruit, and everything going into your car will be cheap trash. You'll be lucky if you get out of there with oil in your engine, a drain plug that's not stripped out, and the correct filter on and tight, and that is no exaggeration. 

 I can do exactly the same thing they do, in my driveway with hand tools, for about $20 worth of stuff from the store and in 15 minutes."

There is nothing like going to a remote park in a different state, unwinding and just having a good time together. I love watching my wife relax in the passenger seat. She always looks so serene when we're on the road in our MH.

5. What sets the RV apart from a hotel, resort, etc., is that it's basically like bringing your house along with you. We only need to load it once when we leave, and once when we get home. We don't have to stop anywhere to eat or use the bathroom, and we're totally self contained once we get where we're going. And while we're underway, my family gets to be comfortable and hang out, just like we're at home.

6. I would agree with that sentiment. RVers have to be a little fearless, and not mind fixing things (because you'll be doing a lot of it). Having lots of disposable cash doesn't hurt."
projectcar,fdd7i7d,t3_ekqcdc,1578298266.0,"That's a Celica Supra. I had one like it years ago, one of the most fun cars I've driven."
GuitarAmps,fdcymxl,t3_eklcbr,1578288222.0," Sweet! I've never owned one of these myself, but I did have a Hotrod DeVille 4x10 that was freaking loud as hell.

 A guy I know was big into these at one time, and had a few different silverface and blackface versions. He's one of those people who can't leave anything alone, always buying, selling, and modding stuff. One of the silverfaces got these replacement speakers with huge freaking magnets, and he could barely lift it into his car afterward. Not sure what he was going for there."
todayilearned,fdcrqig,t1_fdcn0oz,1578282434.0," I guess it could have happened that way, but my coworker who was there didn't seem to think so."
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdcii76,t3_ekgmez,1578275743.0," I worked at a quick lube place in the late 90s. The standard oil change service was $29 after tax, and we were expected to run a $38 average ticket. Pretty much everyone needed to be upsold, and the ancillary services were heavily marked up. Most of the people working there had zero automotive knowledge, and a lot of important things got missed, skipped, or done incorrectly. After what I saw there, I'd never go to one, nor let anyone I know use one."
todayilearned,fdcb7vd,t1_fd9sowc,1578270799.0," This one is in a different state. It's still going, but the building and the area it's in have both become a little run down."
MechanicAdvice,fdcax6x,t3_ekiv4o,1578270623.0," Nice Scout!

 As others have said, lube everything, and try rocking the levers back and forth until they come loose."
ExtremeCarCrashes,fdcac5o,t1_fdbwo48,1578270253.0," I'm from the Midwest, and I rode through southern California on a trip one time. I'm a fairly aggressive rider, and I was on edge the entire time. People will run you down as soon as look at you. I had cars passing me in my same lane. I remember going down one of the freeways in a 55 zone, and cruising at around 100 mph in order to keep up with traffic and not be hit from behind.  

 I thought it was an adventure, but I can see why there are so many bike fatalities out there."
GuitarAmps,fdc9g7k,t3_ekh4ao,1578269730.0,"Nice amp bud. I bought a brand new 4x10 once, and that thing was a monster. I liked the sound though, especially the reverb."
todayilearned,fdc7a8u,t1_fdbb3si,1578268497.0, That's awesome. I had no idea!
Shitty_Car_Mods,fdao0sa,t3_ekefq4,1578248244.0,"Looks like someone bought a cutaway van, and threw a pickup box on it so they could use it. The frame and drive shaft will probably be shortened up at some point. It's a little ugly, but not necessarily a shitty mod."
AmItheAsshole,fd9s6cv,t3_ekb6tr,1578237377.0,"NTA.

 The patient knows what the deal is with their pain meds. Both you and the MD have licenses that could be jepordized if that patient was overmedicated. You covered all the bases. They made a weak attempt to bully you by threatening to go AMA. There's the door, buddy. It's not your job to kiss their ass or beg them to stay. I would do exactly the same thing.

 In the US, insurance sometimes won't cover any part of the stay if the patient goes AMA."
TrueOffMyChest,fd9oytb,t3_ekad1u,1578236250.0," Thank you for your post. I admittedly knew nothing about any of what you posted. You are 100% correct, and I am intrigued enough to learn more about Iran.

 I didn't spend any time on social media in the early 2000s, but I recognize the same sort of hysteria that I saw leading up to the Iraq invasion. People are afraid, and fearful people believe what they're told. 

 Americans are not typically free thinkers, and we've been indoctrinated by several generations of sitting in front of TV. Unfortunately, it is what it is."
GoRVing,fd9n6ee,t1_fd9ifpd,1578235590.0,"You're right about the first iteration of the bridge, and it was probably fine for a very long time.

 I'm just surprised that the government didn't take measures to fix the low clearance issues long ago.  I watched some videos at that website probably 6 years ago, and there were probably 50 accidents between them. One of them was a guy pulling a travel trailer, which was a smaller bumper pull unit.

 I wonder if they could lower the road bed somehow for the extra clearance?"
GoRVing,fd9erq8,t1_fd9ebkb,1578232416.0,Why not? Aren't they supposed to be working for the citizens of that town?
guitars,fd985ny,t1_fd8ugw0,1578229755.0," I used to go to this old luthier for guitar work, and he had nothing but good things to say about Yamaha. They're very well made for the price."
GoRVing,fd97gsa,t1_fd8y0vj,1578229560.0," That may be. But if there are enough bridge strikes to generate a parody YouTube channel, then someone isn't looking out for the people's best interests."
todayilearned,fd96a8w,t1_fd8t7yz,1578229083.0, That's what I have heard about him as well.
todayilearned,fd93udm,t1_fd8mfuu,1578227999.0," Dave Thomas only showed up once during the time I worked there, and it wasn't while I was actually at the restaurant. My coworker was there, and saw him. I made the same assumption you did (partially because of the way the corporate management treated us). Coworker told me he was pleasant, and just got a bowl of chili and sat down out in the dining room. He didn't say anything about getting raked over the coals afterwards. 

 On the other hand, I saw managers from the corporate office a lot. I remember thinking about how unfair it was, because they'd show up during a lunch rush when we were just up to our eyeballs in people, and yell at us if anything was out of place. I was relieved after I started closing and didn't have to deal with them anymore, since they only worked 'banker's hours'."
GoRVing,fd89rr5,t3_ek3pwq,1578215598.0," I've seen a few of the videos from this bridge. They're entertaining, and it's easy to sit back and ridicule the drivers who hit it. But you have to wonder what the people who designed it thought they were doing. And with all the people who have just railed it over the years, why did they think lifting it only 8 inches was going to be sufficient?"
todayilearned,fd85d00,t3_ek78af,1578214047.0," I worked at a Wendy's back in the 90s that was a flagship store. The place was built in what was once a huge bank, and the corporate offices were attached. Every once in awhile, a herd of guys in business suits would spill out of there and into the restaurant, and pick the place apart. They weren't nice about it, either. 

 One of my coworkers was there when Dave Thomas himself showed up. He said Dave just sat down and had a bowl of chili. I think he was actually a decent guy."
