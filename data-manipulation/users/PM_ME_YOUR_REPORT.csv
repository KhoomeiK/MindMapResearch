In 1945 people who’d been living somewhere for generations were disposed on the basis of god given right from 2000 years ago. And since then Israel has unilaterally continued to dispossess people on the basis of race.

No one says Iran isn’t bad, no country should be a theocracy and definitely theocracies shouldn’t have nuclear weapons. But Israel is no better, they’re just technically on our side. And the US is almost as bad. 

If a major war starts in the region Israel while likely be to blame for the escalation just to satisfy internal political hawks."
