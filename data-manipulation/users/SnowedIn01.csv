I really hate to say this because I feel like the biggest neckbeard from /r/atheism, but why? Isn’t the assumption of “something after life” pretty presumptuous considering there’s no tangible evidence or even theoretical evidence of it?

I just really doubt I’m important enough to live on in any capacity after death"
