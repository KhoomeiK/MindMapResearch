Even as we begin this life together, I am just as afraid of it being all for nothing, I fear that despite all our effort, all our strength, that we’ll simply fall apart. So I’ll place my unwavering loyalty and faith within you, but I beg you to keep me steady, as I will fall for you, over and over."
