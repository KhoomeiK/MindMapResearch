SuicideWatch,fftbuzz,t3_ev137e,1580215789.0,"One other thing that didn't really help was my psychiatrist. They never tried to get intimate with my problems, it was like I was just some damaged goods in their eyes. An easy way of getting money. I know that they don't have to pretend to be your close friend or anything else since they are professionals, but man, they almost act like a soulless doll just waiting to give your recipe and call another patient.

Coincidentally, I've heard that over 50% of psychiatrists suffer from depression or another kind of social disorder. They HAVE to close their hearts because otherwise most of them would break. They just get used to seeing shit every day that it becomes normal. This is not much different from police officers/investigators/lawyers who deal with lots of murder cases.

I'm at my limit these past days. I've been dealing with depression for about 4 to 5 years. I've always had anxiety problems in places with lots of people, mainly school and college, but it only became a problem for my day to day life for the last 3 years. I don't want to burden my family even further. They don't know that I've been hiding from them all of these problems since they must think I'm over it for a while. I just fear for the worse and I may be found dead when I can't hold it anymore. I must keep up, but it has become so hard lately."
BlackClover,ffsb8wd,t1_ffs8gf1,1580177599.0,"Promised Neverland and Chainsaw Man are crazy good. And to think that Chainsaw Man has just over a year of serialization and already has sold more than a million copies is incredible. From all the manga presented here, Jujutsu Kaisen is the only one that I haven't read anything but heard good things about it."
