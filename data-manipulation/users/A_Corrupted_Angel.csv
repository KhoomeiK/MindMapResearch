depression,fclmm3l,t3_ehotyn,1577751343.0,"I’ve been the exact situation you’ve been in. They are greatful for having you to cheer them up, but whenever you try to talk to them about your feelings, it seems like nobody cares. I think they think that their problems are so bad, that they can’t relate to anyone. So, whenever you try to open up, I don’t think they think that your problems are that important to their problems. That’s just my guess thought. Could be anything. Sadness can turn into anger if your not careful. Depressed people can snap at the littlest things because they feel sad."

I’m looking forward to actually getting my friends to notice my depression because it seems like I’m hiding my emotions pretty well."
depression,fcar7fx,t1_fc8bkws,1577575011.0,"Even if there was someone to talk to, I’m scared. Scared that if I come out, my mother will treat me like shit. She’s done this before. I forgot to talk about it. After my dad passed away, my sister started getting depressed and she was not coming out of her room. My mom found out and she sent her to a mental hospital. After she got out, she said it was nothing like a mental hospital. I’m guessing that mental hospital had really poor budget or something but, it really didn’t help her mental state at all. After hearing the stories from that place, I’m really scared to come out. So, I’m hiding my feelings, until someone finds out and is capable to throw me into a mental hospital or until I can get my hands and a rope and I commit suicide."
