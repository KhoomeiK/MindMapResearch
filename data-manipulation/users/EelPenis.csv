Infrastructure, utility, common carrier all have a specific legal meaning that is not arbitrary.

The 1st amendment not only doesn't give the FCC charter. The 1st amendment fact limits the FCC's charter. The 1st amendment is used to combat the FCC's overreach, as it should be.

Facebook is not a public nor is it a public forum. It's exactly like your garage because you can run a Facebook out of your garage today. If you want different standards to apply you have to first distinguish Facebook and the companies like it. The fact that you're calling them public is exactly what I'm saying. They're not, but they should be. Right now they actually are your garage and if you start slapping laws willy nilly they'll haunt you in your garage."

I'm not against regulation. I'm against the wrong regulation, such as free speech. I keep saying if it's infrastructure regulate it like infrastructure. The reason you can say what you want over the phone is not fucking free speech. It's the FCC. Coal, electricity, water, sewage, transport, telecom are all public utilities.
