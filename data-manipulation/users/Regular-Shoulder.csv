offmychest,fecsh9c,t3_eo902v,1578982900.0,this is really confusing me. how does the water reach your toothbrush? when you flush does all the water spurt out of your toilet? cause for me it usually just stays in.... my whole bathroom doesnt get covered in toilet water everytime i flush. only occasionly do little drops get out but even then they wouldnt travel all the way to my toothbrush. or are you talking about some weird thing like particles in the air spreading from the water? idk. this makes no sense to me
