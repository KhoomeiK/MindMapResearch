Bend over and grab it without moving the bar.
Allow your shins to move forward until they touch the bar.
Now, keep your hips there. Push your knees out, rotate your chest up so it feels like you're leaning back.
You'll feel the bar click up against the plate hole and even flex. That's the slack.
You'll feel like your whole body is under tension, your ass and hamstrings will be screaming.
Now, you are ready to pull.

Leg press the floor away from you and stand up tall.  Keep your back extended the whole time.
