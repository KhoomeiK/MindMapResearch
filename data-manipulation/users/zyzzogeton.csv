I am going to embark on the odyssey you outline in your several, very informative posts on the win-raid forums, and I am wondering if you ever found a solution to the problem in the Dell BIOS itself that causes this to begin with.  Specifically [this discussion](https://www.win-raid.com/t5787f16-Dell-Server-unable-to-Post-with-UEFI-GPU-s.html)

I don't have a win-raid account so it might be odd to ask for you to discuss another forum's discussion in yet another forum but doesn't this seem like a bug in the R210 BIOS that it can't handle even slightly modern UEFI vBIOS?

Also, since I am going to flash my vBIOS on my 710 the way you describe... I can just put that in a machine that boots with that GT 710 right?  I don't need to have some special benchtop PCI flasher do I?  I haven't poked hardware like this since I had to format CP/M drives (perhaps an exaggeration) but I would hate to lose my $50 investment (gasp!).

Finally, did you remove the cooling from the P400 Quadro and replace it with something passive?  With the R210 there isn't much clearance and the stock fan would seem to be pressed against the lid, making for poor air flow."

Also, that blade edge notch... I don't know if it is something you do when making a nata, but it looked like a fold like one made to weld a piece of harder steel in for the edge on a knife (to prioritize steel for flexibility along the knife body and spine, and sharpness on the edge)... and now it is just gone there."

Overall it was very difficult to get everyone on board with no anesthesia, even though outside of the US it is the norm.  They even had the anesthesiologist come in while I am laying there in my johnny and try to convince me that it would be better and easier with fentanyl.  I said no, and the procedure wasn't pleasant, but I would describe it as ""uncomfortable"" more than painful.  Like having bad gas, only it is a probe with a camera instead of gas.

So if you are in a position where you don't have a loved one who is willing to drive you to and from the doctor, or you have real concern about using anesthesia, be aware that you don't have to go under for a colonoscopy."

Also, don't try to ""sneak"" fasting past your parents.  They might not be terribly supportive, but they will be even less supportive if they feel you are hiding behaviors (even good ones!) from them. 

I suggest you start by just logging your food and letting that be a point where, if they show interest, you start a discussion.  Finding out that there are 7500 calories on the table for 3 people at a single meal can be pretty eye opening, but what you don't want to do is make whomever is the meal preparer feel attacked.

Lastly, I read your comment above and some of your other comments in this thread and you seem to want to be able to lose a weight that it took you 12 years to get to... in an unrealistically short period of time.  I am really sorry to have to tell you that it just doesn't work that way... when I said 1 lb a week for 40 weeks to lose 40 lbs, that is a really safe, achievable and most importantly: sustainable goal... I know you want it to go faster but all the information I have seen on ""crash"" diets and excessive fasting indicate that they either aren't effective or they are detrimental to the long term goal of weight loss.  Intermittent Fasting is not something I would recommend a 12 year old do, you are about to have a crazy time with your developing endocrine system, all humans do, and messing with your insulin levels is probably something you don't want to put your pancreas through.  I'm not a food scientist, or a doctor or anything... but for what it is worth, I think the various kinds of long or short term fasting are unsustainable and dangerous for anyone at your stage of development."
