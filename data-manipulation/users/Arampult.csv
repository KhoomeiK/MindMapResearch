unpopularopinion,ffxu7rm,t1_ffx3po0,1580332517.0,"Well. Even tho you are correct about everything, I get the sense that you do not take it through the realistic perspective. 

Winners write history, duh. But having the power of lies and deception IS PART OF THE WHOLE THING. That is, like it or not, part of being that person who will sit at the top. This, in fact, is the exact reason communism doesn't work in practice. Some people are just better with the ways of making money. Whether that be skills to be deceptive and play the intricate political games, or through sheer power of merit and skill on a topic. All of these traits are a part of being a successful person. The ideal person you are talking about, is the most skilled programmer working at the Silicon Valley making perhaps several millions a year, whose name the world will never hear of. But he is not the 100 billion dollar net worth man Bill Gates is. Because, stealing operating systems from another person to get rich, stealing ideas from Tesla, or stealing the Microsoft OS design for Mac, is like the shortest summary for capitalism. It is part of the trick itself. 

So. Expecting people to be apologetic about their wealth is just a pathetic argument for economic incompetence. You don't ditch the rich, it is the rich who will take your money to ditch you."
unpopularopinion,ffxswsm,t1_ffx8ma3,1580331772.0,"People do not deserve where they were born. The thing is. Arguing that you shouldn't gloat about your wealth because it is just luck, is a fairly incompetent point of view. If a persons family got wealthy through honest means, it is likely because they had some merit that let them do so. Most of these things can be genetic. And thus, the breed of these arguably superior(in means of abilities for money making competence) people can, in fact, own up to their wealth they have inherited however the fuck their heart desires. And you do not have the right to complain about it.

If they are just spoiled brats, tho, you shouldn't even lower yourself to care about them. So, from every perspective, OP's post is nonsensical."
oddlysatisfying,ffwrqfo,t1_ffwqslu,1580309419.0,What did I do. I just got excited to see the same comment just under my comment.
unpopularopinion,ffwqo3n,t1_ffwp5fs,1580308669.0,Are you saying what I am saying wouldn't be the case?
unpopularopinion,ffwoyfh,t3_evl873,1580307425.0,"People don't just ""get wealthy"". It is all about competence and superiority. And that has a lot to do with genes. People don't just end up where they are because ""life sucks sometimes"". If you are the son of a wealthy family, that most commonly means that you are likely a competent person as well. And when the time comes, they take on their families wealth and sometimes triple it, with that shred of competence. Now, I can see no reason to justify to say that people born into wealthy lives can not act like they deserve it. They can, and they do.

The rest of it is about parenting. If a wealthy kid is spoiled, then that means he/she will waste his/her potential.

If you take all the resources Bill Gates has, and give him time, and put him in the spot when he started his empire, he would be able to build it back up all over again. You know why? Because he is competent like that. This applies for most people that earned their wealth. And his children could claim to be righteous of all that wealth, because they are most likely going to wind up in good spots if they are not spoiled, as well."
