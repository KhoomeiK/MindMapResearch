politics,fff2uhm,t3_eta19v,1579874200.0,"Well, I don't know. While I don't agree that the law shouldn't be interpreted strictly as how it was intended when originally written, I'm also having a difficult time barring judges for their personal beliefs. I mean, the constitution was written and then amended when the founders realized that it didn't cover everything it should have for the time. It was then amended a bunch of other times when society presented issues or questions that weren't conceived during the original drafting. Interpretation of the law is exactly what judges are supposed to do. This sets precedent for future cases. And if the people are unhappy with the interpretation of the law, then they craft new laws to address the specific issue. 

So based on that, if judges are of the opinion that they should not interpret the law, and that is a core duty of their job, then maybe they should be barred from being judges? Like for example, if I worked at mcdonalds, and my job was to take the burger and cook it and serve it, but I felt like we should present the burger as it was originally given to us, raw. Then perhaps I shouldn't be working at mcdonalds."

politics,fetzm60,t1_fets1hb,1579381622.0,"That really depends on the level of decency and morality the person has. I'm sure you've noticed a trend in public figures. Some that have been caught doing misdeeds have denied, deflected, and even doubled down. While others that you've seen have, at the mere suggestion that they've done something wrong, by either ignorance or ineptitude, stepped down willingly. 

It goes to the mindset of the person, for what I call the 'right and the privilege', which goes like this. Some see themselves as the rightful leaders of others. That their ideas and desires are the best for them and those around them. Sure, others may get hurt in the process, but ultimately they are the best person for the job, and despite whatever they've done to hurt others, they still deserve to keep their role and continue on. 

On the other side you have those that see it as a priviledge to lead. In these people, you'll find, that they believe that they might not be the best person for the role, but having been granted the opportunity, they will fulfill the role to the best of their ability. And if they do something that, again through ignorance or ineptitude,  hurts others, they will willfully step aside in order for someone more worthy to have the privilege of leading. 

Unfortunately,  you'll find that those with the mindset that they have the right will manipulate those that believe they have the privilege into resigning in order to install others with the same mindset that they have the right. In addition, those that believe they have the right, will perform any task, no matter how low, in order to secure their power, with the self imposed knowledge, that they have the right to rule, and that the ends justifies the means."

My point here was that the Amish, who initially rejected the vaccine, saw the necessity of it and reversed course on their objections.  And that citing religion as an excuse for not vaccinating is not a valid reason."
politics,fdsh79u,t1_fdsa5os,1578702680.0,"You're right of course. Your body, your choice. However, what your missing here us that while you may have the right to not vaccinate yourself or your children. You do not have the right to subject your petri dish of a body on those who have legitimate reasons for not being vaccinated, and may be harmed or killed by your selfish attitude of ""it's my body and to hell with everyone else"".

Let's try this in a different way. With no experience and very little research you can put together your own motor vehicle. It has a wheels, it has a gas tank, it has seats and a steering wheel. You may take it around your back yard and think, ""this is a safe car. I only have brakes on one tire, no seatbelts, no muffler, no headlights or taillights, but that's ok. I don't need to put all this safety stuff on. I've never got into an accident before. Besides, It's my car, my choice."" 

But here's the deal. You try to take it on a public road, and you're endangering everyone you come across. Not just pedestrians that cant be in their own vehicle for various reasons, but also those in their own vehicles that got all those pesky safety features that you skipped out on. And in addition the police will force you to take that deathtrap off the public road, because you might not care about your own health, but you will not be allowed to be a threat to the public.

However, religious freedom does not grant any right to infringe on the freedoms of others, and that extends to the health and safety of others. Even the Amish, let me say that again, THE AMISH chose to vaccinate in 1979 during a polio outbreak. After initially refusing the vaccine due to religious restrictions,  a successful campaign to explain the need for vaccination resulted in the Amish community vaccinating, citing that it was for the health and safety of the non amish community as well.  Even the Amish understood the concept of herd immunity. (Not trying to disparage the Amish community, just pointing out that a community that eschews technological advancement saw the need of vaccines for the health and safety of all.)

The point is, religion is never a reason to harm others. And if you call yourself a christian, you should learn that the most christian thing you can do in this situation, is to not force others to sacrifice their health, their safety, or their lives for you, but to do everything in your power to aid your neighbor, your community, and your fellow humans."

I can technically see sho they call, and I can see their text messages, but it's not something I've gone into. I've explained the danger of certain types of selfies and the like, and stressed that they should never text something to someone that they wouldn't be willing to say to that persons face. Other than that, the conversations they have with their friends are none of my business. It does enable safe searches for google, bing, Yahoo, etc. And will block porn, and warn them that they may be about to access restricted sites. But again, this isn't something I'm super concerned about. The boys especially will bypass this wherever they can. (Puberty) one of my sons wanted to show me a meme he found funny, and I saw that one of the other tabs he had was a wikipedia entry for oral sex. They're gonna use whatever they can get their hands on to jerk it I guess."

Mom: you want fishsticks?

3yo son: no

Mom: how bout pizza rolls?

3yo son: uh.... no... I want a sandwich

Mom: a sandwich? You want tuna or peanutbutter?

3yo son: no

Mom: what kind of sandwich?

3yo son: um... marshmallow 

Mom: you can't have marshmallow.

3yo son: uh peanut butter and jelly.

Mom: ok, you want strawberry or grape?

3yo son: uh strawberry... I'LL GET IT! *runs to fridge *

>She arched a brow at me. ""Does the color really matter?""

>""Huh?""

>""A lot of the use of magic is all tied up with your emotions. With what you believe is real. when I was younger, I learned a lot of stuff, like the role of colors in the casting of spells. Green for fertility and prosperity, red for passion and energy, white for purity, black for vengeance, and so on. It could be that the color doesn't matter at all--but if I expect the spell to work because of the color used, then that color is important. If I don't believe in it, the spell won't ever get off the ground.""

In addition, props aren't necessary either. Harry says that all magic can be done in the mind, again all tied up with belief. if you can maintain in your mind/imagination, the idea of an audible beat, maintain it with such clarity that you can hear it yourself, that would probably work too. 

Necromancers probably use an audible beat because that's how they were taught. it's what they believe will work. If someone was trying to put it together for themselves and didn't believe that they needed the audible beat in order to raise a corpse zombie, they would probably be able to. Although, i do agree with some of the other comments on here. You're doing enough by performing necromancy, probably be a bad idea to tie your own heart beat thaumaturgically with a zombie. If nothing else, i'd say it might cause a link back to you that if someone did something to your zombie, it could flow back to you with the same link."
