minipainting,ffh9xvi,t3_ersuns,1579927412.0,"Weird, my experience is opposite to most folks here. The first proper paints I got were Vallejo and found them really hard to work with. Got some GW base trivially cheap in a magazine and loved them, now I've a bunch of base and contrast stuff and only use my old Vallejo's to fill in the blanks. I much prefer the pots (I just damp by brush to thin) and I've no issues."
