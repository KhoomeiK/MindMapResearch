espresso,ff9deug,t1_ff7yaii,1579710565.0,This machine only has a steam pressure gauge but I was reading that the brew pressure gauge isn't usually accurate anyway so I'll willing to forego that feature. I'm curious as to what site you found your machine on. I'm located in Canada and I don't really wanna pay import fees so I'm gonna stick to Canadian sites for refurb stuff. Keep hoping that I'll find someone who's looking to upgrade their current machine and wants to sell it. I'm handy so I think I could fix things that need fixing as long as it's not too technical. Only thing I'm worried about is how the machine was stored.
espresso,ff8zkil,t1_ff74g70,1579700985.0,Lol neither. I just deducted 10% from its original value in CA$ each year for 10 years. So as the principal reduced in size the 10% was also lower. Figured it was simple but it's probably not too accurate.

Coffee,fed9g4n,t1_fed913x,1579004630.0,"Same here! I found out about it on a show called the Expanse. I thought it was silly but I figured if I had old coffee, how much worse could it be. Oh make sure to take it black or it'll curdle the milk. Also, try a few drops first and see how you like it.

Edit: In the show, they don't have access to fresh coffee and lemons in space, so they make do with matchstick heads. Not sure how well that works, but I've seen some people say internet that they tried it and liked it."
Coffee,fed8xkv,t3_eok9wg,1579004082.0,Try squeezing some lime or lemon juice after brewing. Works with darker roasts better.

bapcsalescanada,fdtyoww,t1_fdsei71,1578724434.0,I saw a ThinkPad x395 for CA$800 a couple weeks ago. On the Lenovo IBM EPP website. Maybe it's still on sale? You can get some cashback with the Rakuten plugin. I know that it was 9% cashback for me during the Boxing Day period.

bapcsalescanada,fdsctsz,t1_fds8r71,1578699700.0,AMD Ryzen 3500 or 3700 would also be a budget good alternative to the i5 or i7. Usually around 200$ cheaper than their Intel equivalents.

Coffee,fdn8ccx,t3_ema2zc,1578580010.0,It's worth it for work. My workplace has preground ESE pods which I do not appreciate and I figured it would be very distracting if I brought in my electric grinder so I invested in a cheap $20 hand grinder but the plastic insert cracked and I saw some chips on the ceramic burrs so I took that as an excuse to upgrade to an mbK AerSpeed for Christmas (although I did order the new grinder before the old one was damaged). The Aerspeed is at least twice as fast as the knock-off Hario grinder. Definitely worth it.
