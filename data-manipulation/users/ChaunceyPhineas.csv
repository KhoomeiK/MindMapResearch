That said, I was only pleasantly surprised because of how low my expectations were going into it, and it was slightly better than I expected, but still ultimately kind of garbage.

Looking through my 60-some game, I would have to say...Disgaea 5. I love Tactical RPGs, but this game is just a huge miss for me. The difficulty curve is all over the place, and it leans into so many bullshit tropes.  


And the game just keeps relentlessly throwing subsystems at you. Every time you complete a mission, you go back and get 1-3 new game systems thrown at you, for skills, crafting, whatever. It's been a while so I don't remember specifics, just the impression.  


Eventually I just collapsed under the same pile of JRPG bullshit that always drives me away from Japanese RPG games. It's like they're all competing to show how much unnecessary mechanical bloat they can cram onto a cartridge, and it's always totally disjointed and uninspired."

I don't even know how I'd react to that.   


I grouped up with a friend of mine and his boyfriend one time. My friend doesn't have any sort of inflection other than a slight accent from being French-Canadian, but his boyfriend has a VERY animated and inflected way of speaking. I don't want to just say ""a lisp"" because that sounds derogatory, but that's what it is. He speaks in a way that virtually advertises that he's a gay man. 

I was nervous every time we joined group chat in each game because I was waiting for someone to say some shit. But it never happened. A dozen Comp games and not so much as a peep about the way he spoke, let alone anything derogatory.

I really do think people are selling themselves short by applauding this game. It's really 100% flash, and that's saying something for a Pokemon game. I really appreciate how beautiful the game is, but as a GAME it's just objectively bad.

What really bothers me about it is that there's no reason for that. Pokemon is the most valuable IP on earth. GameFreak has a game it KNOWS people are going to buy.

I have pretty much everything I want in life that money can't buy, and a shitload of money would enable me to stop worrying about the things it can. I'd be able to buy a house, get rid of my debts, and sack away enough in trust funds for the next 2 generations of my family, and pay off all the debts of the people closest to me.

I can't say that I wouldn't make the same mistakes others who end up ruined by the lottery make, but the last time I came into a windfall of money, I blew 10% of it and was super careful/paranoid about the way I used the rest. I felt that the key to not wasting all that money was to earmark a specific amount of it for tomfoolery, and I was able to get a car, take a cruise in style, pay off all of my bad debt, and buy everything we needed for our new baby, while also building a bomb-ass PC and buying a bunch of Mega Man action figures and shit.

And it would enable me to start the business I want to start (But have no reasonable way of securing funding for without jeopardizing my family's security), and I think that would really make me happy, especially if I was able to do it without going into debt, and doing it how I want to.

And most of the bad times my wife and I have had are directly or indirectly due to money, but very few of the good times we have have required it, so I think that's a good sign too.

I don't really view money as a salve for something missing, and I don't care about status or vanity. I see money as a way out of worries, as a way to let people actually live their lives. I feel like the only reason people want to buy shit half the time is because they can't. So when they can, they scramble to fill a hole they feel they have. I've been there and I've felt that."

But, people also do this when they don't think the DM would let their plan work if they explained it to them, and they are trying to catch their DM offguard so as not to give up the whole ruse, and by letting the DM resolve each part of the ruse without being aware of the broader plan, they basically trap the DM into allowing it.

While there's nothing against the rules with that, it's pretty dishonest. Again. I can't SAY you were trying to do this, but ""DM doesn't know what I'm planning"" really suggests it is.

And again, I understand why people do this. I have done it before.

But it shows a gulf of trust between the players and DM. That alone makes me think that the DM probably was punishing you, if for no other reason than to avoid having to redirect the narrative to allow for that (potentially) radically different course.

I understand why someone would do that as well.

What I would recommend is ALWAYS TELL YOUR DM WHAT YOUR OBJECTIVE IS AND THEN DISCUSS USING YOUR ABILITY AS A MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. It turns it, with an at all decent DM, into a collaborative experience that most DMs will make work just by virtue of you coming up with a creative and clever plan to accomplish something.

This also gives the DM a chance to modify how the event plays out so that it works for them as well as you. This is what I ALWAYS do when I come up with crazy plans.

Schedule sessions weeks, months in advance. My group has twice-monthly sessions on the schedule through March.

This way people can try to work their schedules around it.

Especially into adulthood, people will start planning things further and further out, because our schedules get more complex. I don't see why you wouldn't do that with your RPGs.

And sure, people can't make it often enough. Stuff comes up. But this hedges your chances. Either way, if 2/5 people can't make it, just get together and play board games, or google [SchoolGirl](http://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1474519157780.pdf) RPG and run that for a couple hours that night. We specifically have a campaign set up in Beyond that's random characters, and we have a prepub campaign we will run if a random assortment of people can't make it and we just want a hack and slash.

And if you have the Spouse who will grouse at the notion of planning a ""Game with your friends"" weeks ahead of time, just remind them that it's not about the game, but it's about seeing your friends, and about the fact that the game only works if people commit to trying to show up. It's not that it's something you can't miss, it's just that we have to coordinate well ahead of time to make sure people can make it.

EatCheapAndHealthy,fdjahq2,t3_eljrnk,1578463270.0,"Breakfast? Get a GOOD small, nonstick pan. Scrambled Eggs requires 1 small bowl, the pan, and the plate.

Wanna spice that up? Chop up a couple spinach leaves, or dice up a really small amount of ham. Or a pinch of sharp cheddar. A very little bit of ham, cheddar or spinach adds a lot of flavor. But don't go heavy on the cheese. Less is more here.

You'll get it down-pat and it'll take you 5 minutes start to finish and it's mostly idiotproof, and it's really easy to add to your morning routine, and you can mix up how you make it.

Cooking isn't about skills or discipline. That all comes later (or doesn't). It's about finding a couple things you can make, and then getting good at making them. Then pieces start falling into place. My mother in Law makes the same damn cheesy potatoes every thanksgiving, but they turn out the same every time, and they're fucking amazing. Repetition.

My signature dish is a Balsamic Roast Pork Tenderloin. I can make it with my eyes closed, and it turns out the same every time, and I honestly think it's restaurant quality. It's only like 6 ingredients and I do it all in 1 pan and 1 measuring cup. It takes about a half hour, but most of that is oven time. It's not so good because i'm talented. It's because I found the recipe and kept doing it.

Plus eggs are dirt cheap, and honestly if you only use a small amount of it, Ham and Spinach are too. You could have a filling, HOT breakfast every morning for 5 minutes of your time, for probably like $1 in total cost. Throw in some toast if you really need them carbs to get you going."

Personally I just [brine](https://fortheloveofcooking.net/2015/05/brined-and-baked-chicken-breasts.html) my chicken breast with salt, lemon, peppercorn, and some thyme. I'll leave them overnight, and then sous vide them. Packed with flavor. I tend to go a little lighter on my salt because i'm leaving the chicken in longer. I think you'll usually be ok if you put your chicken into the brine before work in the morning, and then take them out when you get home.

Before I had the sous vide, I would sear them in my stainless pan, and then bake them. Just when baking chicken breast, check that temp ALL THE TIME, and pull them out when they're at like 160. They will keep rising in temp. They need to just barely touch 165.

In general, I recommend buying a [2 probe thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/SMARTRO-Digital-Thermometer-Cooking-Commercial-Grade/dp/B07WNV6HPK/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=dual+probe+thermometer&qid=1578462231&sr=8-18). I like to put one probe into my thickest piece, and one into my thinnest. The little bit of extra effort to get the temps just right will make all the difference.

More than anything with chicken breast, it comes down to how you cook it. You can always make a sauce or something if it's not flavorful enough.

Also, I suggest pounding out or [butterflying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP_TRCBjTRc) your chicken breasts to help them cook faster. Just get them all to a roughly even thickness. The less time you need to cook chicken boobs, the better.

Understand, while you're in a game, Diablo 3 does LITERALLY NOTHING to make you compete against other characters IN ANY WAY. The \*ONLY\* way a player can negatively impact your experience is if you're trying to do content you can just barely manage. Otherwise, you're only benefiting.

A lot of people either have a lot going on, or they're just not GOOD at reaching out. There's always a million reasons not to reach out, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's not uncommon for a group of friends to have someone who serves as the lynchpin, who makes an effort to keep them all together. That doesn't mean those people aren't real friends, it just means that they're used to having someone there to maintain the group bond.

So you have to ask yourself, do you want to have this circle of friends? Is there someone maintaining that group bond? No? Well then do it. IT's not ACTUALLY that hard, but it's a daunting task that will often, especially into adulthood, be met with regular failure.

THis is one big reason I love D&D (As a blanket term for RPGs in general), is it gives us an explicit reason to get together on a regular basis. We piss away half the night catching up and talking about mututal interests, but that's the point.
