TeslaSolar,fgm93h2,t1_fgm7nbk,1580920209.0,"The PowerWall was the real reason we got solar in the first place.  When we moved to Milford, CT, within a month of moving in, we experienced an outage which lasted 10 days.  It was a freak 3-foot snowstorm in October and it brought down a lot of trees, but still.  We had a kid on the way and decided we needed help.  We didn't want a roll-out generator which required constant fueling, noise and monthly testing when not in use.  We also didn't have the space for a pad, exterior fuel source, etc for a generator which could live outside.  Along comes Elon and we're good.

I hope your system stabilizes after the new inverter gets installed.  The inverter really is the work horse of the whole system and they will need replacement over time.  If you're in central Mass, it's likely we share the same electrician from Solar City/Tesla..."
TeslaSolar,fglz93n,t1_fglysil,1580914547.0,"While I don't know if you leased or bought (we bought), I don't think it matters.  There is a minimum service standard which was likely discussed before signing off on the project.  That's what you'll be able to hold them to.

One thing we've yet to resolve...  We have a PowerWall but are unsure when it is in use.  I got a text about a month ago from my neighbor at 10pm, saying he was jealous of our solar.  I was confused until he noted the whole neighborhood's power was out, but our house was lit up like a Christmas tree.  I liked that - never even saw a brown out - but we would have reduced the use of unneeded power draws, like our electric dryer, had we known it was out..."

TeslaSolar,fglpgwy,t3_eyzp8n,1580907294.0,"At the onset of our solar purchase, our inverter went bad a few times.  They eventually replaced it with a larger one which could handle significantly more power than originally expected.  Now it works great and has for 2+ years.  Being winter, you're not generating all that much power anyway, so they're likely to have fewer employees this time of year.  

In year one, when we had our inverter problem, it was over the summer.  Tesla, true to their word, did the estimated difference in power generation and paid us for the solar power generation goal which was missed.  I'll take it."

unpopularopinion,fgii71h,t1_fgifaek,1580822396.0,"Sounds like we agree that there's a middle ground somewhere.  Not every public primary educational system is like Simsbury, Farmington, Avon, New Canaan, Darien, etc.  But it's also not like Bridgeport, Hartford, Waterbury, Willimantic, etc.  On average, it's a pretty good system which will prepare kids who have college in mind, for college.  Most offer courses which are accepted at colleges and will not only introduce kids to Calculus or advanced science or history, but complete the needs for 101 and 102 classes, which are the biggest beasts at school, especially for year one students.  Sitting in an auditorium with a hundred other kids, learning the basics, can be dreary, especially when college and lack of parents within close proximity is a new experience - and at 8am....  Having that knowledge in your head for a year already gives a great foundation for getting through those classes.  Once a student has reached the more advanced 200 level classes, the topics are typically more specific and the focus allows the student to really explore the subject alongside other students with similar passion for the topic."
