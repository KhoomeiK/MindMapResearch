I think they just have higher energy and if they have buddies around they’re more likely to play and wrestle. We conceded and let them go about and figure life out on their own. Once we got them neutered they calmed down a bit. They’re boys so they’re still a little rambunctious, but they’re much calmer now. Just takes time."
cats,fdk5epx,t3_eltwgo,1578496464.0,"I’ve had the same problem! My cats are also 8 months old or so and one of them used to meow like crazy at the door. He’d wake me up every night at 3 am, 5 am, and again around 6 am before our alarm. I couldn’t sleep and was getting so irritable. I tried letting him in, locking him out, but what worked best was truly ignoring him. I know you said you did this but it took us a few months and now he doesn’t meow at all, at least not until 7 am when we’re already awake. I got ear plugs for the time being and they work wonders. I also recommend maintaining a routine with your cat, so always keep them outside your bedroom at night and feed them at the same time everyday so they don’t wake up hungry and meow for food."

SkincareAddiction,fdj9rc3,t3_elntyo,1578462595.0,Tea tree oil! I put it on red spots and a whitehead almost never forms and it goes away naturally. I’d recommend reducing your washing to once a day at nighttime and just water in the morning. Over washing can irritate your skin and lead to greater breakouts. If you’re oily just use a toner in the morning.
SkincareAddiction,fdj9jcj,t3_elicin,1578462397.0,"I always recommend going natural, non-foaming face wash is better and a light oil with a fragrance-free (minimal ingredient list) moisturizer if needed. I use jojoba oil and that’s it. Avoid fragrance as much as possible!

It’s tough because unless your work friends are close they probably don’t know what to say in those situations, especially since you’re new. I’m sure they all feel genuinely sorry for you and have your best interest in mind, some people just don’t know how to show it. You’re lucky your friends are so understanding and are there for you, so I’d rely on them! But who knows, I’d keep an open mind about your coworkers and if you open up to one you may find someone who responds sensitively which might strike up a new friendship."

My suggestion is to open up to your family about what you’re going through and to let them know how you feel and how they can maybe help you. I’m an open book so I’m always big on communication even if it’s uncomfortable at first, it always leads to a good outcome. My second thought is to try exercising (if you don’t already). I run and do at home workouts and I always feel like a new person afterwards. Those endorphins really do help."
hsp,fdfuh7e,t3_ekp52y,1578370533.0,"You can definitely be both! When asked, I describe myself as an introvert who’s really good at being an extrovert. The way I think of it is how do you get your energy, from being around people (extrovert) or having alone/down time (introvert)? I get it from both, but definitely need down time more than time with others. It’s funny my brother is the complete opposite, and so if one of my best friends. But they understand that side of me so it’s great having people to go out with when you’re in the mood but also who won’t take offence when you need to be alone.

Edit: now that I think about it, the hsp in me is why I’m so good at being an extrovert cause I hate when other people are uncomfortable (cause I absorb that energy) so I’m more likely to approach them and make them feel welcome etc. But I can only do that so much, then I need to be alone for a few days."

We were able to snag quite a bit of furniture from my parents which is old but better quality than many new pieces out there so inevitably we won’t be tossing things out as much. I recommend buying consignment and/or good quality furniture/home goods as spending the money will reduce waste in the long run. I also recommend donating as much as you can in the process or selling it on kijiji. For small things I know can’t be donated I usually put them on kijiji free which is better than going into the landfill. Good luck on the move!
