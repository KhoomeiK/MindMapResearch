Disagree, we just know they responded in the system the ship came from. They might be able to respond through any gate at any time, but chose this one. Also, they do consciousness and vacuum bubbling attacks in Sol even though the gate hasn’t been used in the preceding hour/short period.

I think the authors are definitely pointing to Tecoma being a trap set up by the Protomolecule Builders for the Goths. After the GRB the Goths rapidly retaliate in the slow zone. That tells me they were not expecting that. From their perspective:

Us: Antimatter train station bombing
Them: Proportional targeted air strikes in Tecoma
Us: NYC nuked via Tecoma
Them: Nuke the slow zone and flip a shit?

I think it is a bit contrived, but the idea is that there are maybe 40 systems without planets that the rings decided were worth connecting to. This was the only one without some obvious artifact (like the diamond sphere) that was worth studying that Duarte didn’t want to risk breaking. Why was Tecoma important enough to have a ring to/connect to then? Because it was an elaborate (but untriggered) trap."
TheExpanse,feilzdm,t3_ep3eto,1579141649.0,"They were searching for a system with nothing of value, in case of retaliation.

They say only a few, maybe 30-40 systems don’t have habitable planets - those are the ones Elvi is investigating, because most has something else interesting going on, something important enough to dedicate a ring to.

They didn’t anticipate the way the Goths responded - by having the vacuum bubble out mass much much faster than they saw in Sol, triggering the GRB. 

It seems pretty clear that the Protomolecule builders set Tecoma as a trap of some sort, which is interesting, because it tells us they knew how they would respond and that the Goths didn’t understand GRB/the danger.

 It’s not clear why the pile of the neutron star being aligned with the ring (which was unusually far out and on the pole, not the equatorial plane, like usual) didn’t skeev Duarte out. You would think that would’ve smelled fishy/dangerous."

lifeisstrange,fddjowi,t1_fdd8hyp,1578314949.0,"Ok, I almost stopped reading when you started insulting me for making a different choice in a game than you. I’m not valuing Chloe’s life less, just not valuing it more than everyone in the Bay. You keep making this hair splitting distinction croon over whether or not it’s a trolly problem because Chloe is safe when you make the decision. Why on Earth does that matter? If the trolley were about to harm the 5 people in the original, and Chloe were on the other track, and your choice was to let the 5 people die or change tracks and kill Chloe, it would be the same thing. 

No one in this argument was judging you on anything except your insistence that this isn’t anything like a trolley problem because reasons. At the end of the day, most people would sacrifice the town irl, but that doesn’t change the moral problem. You have the power to save the Bayers at the cost of Chloe. She willingly offers to sacrifice herself, and you have to choose. It is fine to choose Chloe. It is a better story if you choose Chloe. Max will be happier. It is also fine to say you have to save the Bayers, because you have the power to do it and their lives also matter. 

Insisting that all that matters is affirming Chloe’s self worth is equally myopic. There’s people in the town. They also have worth, and you can save them. You get two timelines, two tracks, and whatever you choose, someone suffers. No one would demand that a soldier throw himself on a grenade to save 12 guys around him. But no one would call him anything but a hero. Chloe is willing to die, yes, because she is depressed and suicidal and has low self worth/esteem, but also because her Mom is in that diner iirc, and because people she knows and maybe even some she cares about will die if she doesn’t. That’s heroic, and tragic, and choosing to allow her to make that choice to save the Bay is not wrong either. Both options should pain you. It leads to a less complete story. The story isn’t complete without the other ending, you’re supposed to watch both, obviously."

>The galactic disk looked the same as it had in Sol system, but the constellations not quite like her own. Parallax, she knew, was how they’d started mapping which systems were on the other sides of the gates. She’d seen a map once - the splash of systems that the gates connected. Thirteen hundred stars in a galaxy with three hundred billion of them. They’d been clumped together, the gate- network stars. The two furthest systems were hardly more than a thousand ly apart. A little more than one percent of the galaxy, and still unthinkably vast.

So it certainly sounds like they’re in a little clump."
lifeisstrange,fdd7m9j,t1_fdd4k4o,1578298417.0,"Its a giant 1/2 mile plus wide tornado, so at least like, F2, F3. It doesn’t need to kill 100%, just like, 20, for the case to be relevant. Plus, again, Max can always keep the photo and find out if everyone makes it and then make/remake her decision, but it’s pretty clear the audience is supposed to assume there will most likely be deaths, probably many based on the size and possibly supernatural nature of the storm. I suppose there could be no deaths, but it’s doubtful. 

In the second paragraphs, I agree with all of your characterization of Chloe, I’m just saying, it’s pretty clearly a trolley problem. You can say it’s a bullshit reason, but that’s the question, do you choose to save the larger number or is that bullshit. Same with the various trolley problems, like the famous organ donation problem. Why shouldn’t terminally ill or depressed patients be killed and their organs harvested to save 5 or 6 other sick people who could live decades? Because fuck no, that’s why. Why sacrifice Coventry, England to keep the German codes broken - because it’ll save more lives down the line if we can end the war sooner. You don’t have to agree with saving the Bay, but the choice is a bloody trolly problem. How you solve it is up to you. 

The trolley problem isn’t a solved problem. There isn’t an answer. That’s why it’s in philosophy books. Most people will say, sure kill the one person. Then the prof says, “but it’s your grandma”, and the students squirm and say I guess. And then the prof says, ok, now it’s your Mom and we’re harvesting her organs, and the students say “hold up, that’s different,” and the prof says not really, I’ve just changed the method death, and made the trolley metaphorical, but that is clearly wrong, so you see that it’s not trivial. And that forces you to start saying, well, if a father killed his terminally ill self a month early to save his wife and kids injured in a car accident he caused via his miraculously compatible organs, we might call it noble. But if we lived in a society that started requiring people to give organs or accept euthanasia to save ill patients, we would call that a dystopia, so clearly the morality of the action relates to its scale there. Maybe on the margin it’s noble, but if it’s a social rule or even a law, it becomes bad. The whole point is you can go back and forth on it 100 ways.

In this case, I would argue the game pushes the drama and character development the way the decision plays out, rather than exploring the moral quandary in detail, which is fine.  By having Max visit the Two Whales before finding Chloe, which begs the question of how much time people had to get out, despite clearly suggesting that there’s a lot of people already stuck or trapped, the undermine the choice they’re forcing you to make. Then they make it worse, because you don’t have the option to go find out what happens if you save Chloe, survey the damage, then jump back and let her die and see if that really stops the storm at all, because that would be a bad game and kill the moment. But it’s probably what Max would decide she has to do. She would want to know what decision she was really making, and unlike most people, she actually has the power to find out. They do the same with tome travel generally throughout, it’s not always used in necessarily the smartest way and all the weird solutions Max could come up with aren’t offered, because the branching options are in service of character development and story, not navel gazing at time travel paradoxes and clever hacks (which Max herself, if this were real, might desperately try to exploit given all the awful things that happen).

As for the third paragraph, what texts? I don’t remember."
worldbuilding,fdd4rnj,t3_ekpe5b,1578294761.0,"Honestly, biggest failing of most narratives is that they are all recovery narratives. They spread this idea that - you get sick, you recover, you get better. That’s how a depressive episode works for most people, or recovering from a trauma, or a breakup, but it’s often not how mental illness works. It often recurs and becomes a problem again or is chronic. The trick is learning to cope with it so the symptoms don’t interfere with your life so much.

The bad thing about this approach is that while it’s a satisfying power story, it’s gives people unrealistic expectations when people in their orbit deal with mental illness, or when people deal with it themselves. 

They think of it like cancer - you battle it, win, and then you’re a survivor. If it comes back, it’s metastasized and you fought the hard fight, but it eventually gets you. For some people, that may be a good analogy, but it pigeonholes a lot of people as “untreatable/unsaveable (I.e. pathetic, losers, etc) and it also completely discounts the possibility that a lot of people who are never cured may be more like people with a disability that is sometimes a problem for them, like color blindness or having to use a wheelchair, and can still lead good lives that society shouldn’t throw away by telling those people they are toxic, broken, etc.

On the other end, you’ve got shows that just kind of show off mental illness realness, but don’t really think about recovery at all, and just show it as if to say “here’s something you can relate to,” rather than dealing with the characters learning to cope more functionally/healthily, despite still dealing with symptoms."
lifeisstrange,fdd3zoz,t1_fdd32aa,1578293825.0,"Where did Max come from? I don’t remember. If you’re putting the onus on people to escape a tornado, I’d point to like, every F5 tornado to ever hit a popular area to say that’s dumb. 

I don’t disagree that what happens to Chloe if you sacrifice her is unfair and awful or that she offers herself up in large part out of self hatred. It’s one of the big reasons I liked the game. I related to that. But in offering herself up, the town is saved, and the people who die in the storm would survive. We know that because the other ending exists.

The town being destroyed isn’t “the events of nature” any more than Chloe dying is. Neither timeline is the “proper” one. You can let Chloe be murdered and the town will live, you can save her, but the town dies. 

And Max was hanging from the tree in BtS imo because Chloe was deeply hurt by her abandonment. She needed Max and she abandoned her, at the same time her Dad died, she had to deal with puberty/middle school, and her Mom probably withdrew some, before dating a guy she hates. She was furiously hurt by Max."

TheExpanse,fdd1sdb,t1_fdcnc4z,1578291383.0,"I thought about Naomi just being wrong. I think that’s what they kind of suggested with the 50,000 in Cibola - that it was an exaggeration. Problem is she says she saw a map once (I looked up the chapter), and there’s no way 23rd century astronomers would have that much trouble, after 30 years, locating systems. Gaia is measuring systems today that are tens of thousands of light years away, so by then, I expect that it should be possible, with enough computer time, to simply chart all the bright stars in a planet’s sky and see where in the Milky Way might match that. Then confirm it by taking a 15 inch scope to one of these systems and trying to observe a couple of pulsars or nebula. Hell, even just pointing at Sagittarius A* should give you a good idea of the angle between you, the center of the galaxy, and Earth (because you can see the stars orbiting the black hole. Although, actually...that would be hairy, but still, might get you there. You could also use globular clusters as a set of beacons. I mean, bottom line is that there are just soooo many ways to get the rough galactic locations that if they’re all within 1000 ly of one another on the map, I’m guessing the map is right and mostly complete.

I agree that the slow zone is definitely not in our realm, I more meant that the station knew “oh, new gate opened, huh...Earth, been waiting on that one for a long time. I guess I’ll open the 1300 gates I have, you probably want the stars closest to Earth right now, right? I’ll do that”. Although, you’re right - not sure why that would make the most sense if the slow zone isn’t anywhere in particular. Not like it saves power."
lifeisstrange,fdd0yrm,t1_fdcmtbz,1578290496.0,"Whether the storm is Max’s fault or not (it isn’t) is irrelevant. The final decision is presented by the game as - photo jump to the bathroom and see if that saves the town, sacrificing Chloe, or save Chloe and accept the consequences, which are probably that the town gets destroyed, and a bunch of people die. She’s presented as standing at the switch. 

Now, sure, she has imperfect knowledge, but given the stakes, she could go back to the bathroom and figure out if it stops the storm. Then she would still be able to go back to the bathroom again and make the choice to save Chloe with full knowledge of the consequences."
TheExpanse,fdcmmni,t1_fdclpey,1578278681.0,"The interesting thing is that this doesn’t explain the 1000 ly retcon. Even if the systems that survived were originally in a small cluster, they’d be spread out by now. If all 1300 are really that close, it kind of implies there are a ton more intact rings in the Milky Way, like 1,000,000 more, that weren’t burned, and the station just connected to the ones close to Earth."

That sentence about the lead based paint is a legally required notice, so the lease may not be BS. 

Ask them for a new copy. It’s not ok for them to give you an unintelligible copy, and if they hem and haw about it, they probably aren’t someone you want to live with. Also, they could be hiding something in the unintelligible lease if they did it intentionally."
