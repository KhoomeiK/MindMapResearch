wholesomememes,ffpx2cf,t1_ffoo72l,1580109147.0,"I hear that. Back some 3 years ago now, during my first 'relationship' if you could even call it that, we had known each other and played R6S together nearly daily for 2-3 months, didnt talk outside of the game. Had an opportunity where she was stuck in the car for a lot of hours and at her dads house with nothing much to do we got to talk a lot. after talking intensively for a week or two me, in my antisocial divot I had created in the prior 2 years, had the purest form of affection for this girl. I could empathize with her on depression and anxiety, she could be the caring hand when I was down, at the time we were perfect for each other. But times change, we all grow up eventually. Despite her being just under a year younger than me she grew up before I had. She told me that a long distance relationship would never work, especially not with the state she was in. She never really said goodbye but she was gone. I held on,.I actually thought I could make her love me if I just gave myself a chance. It never did. I would check and read the last few messages I had sent every day, when I woke up, any free moment I had, and before going to sleep. It took all the strength I had to not send a never ending flow of messages. Despite this I sent a message every couple of days, only ever getting a reply every couple of weeks. By no means large replies. If I was lucky I would get a couple short messages back and forth before she hid again. I was desperate, I knew it, we all could see it. At that point I had only ever seen the one picture she sent to me the night before she dissapeared. I kept that photo as my phone background for 5 months. I dont know what it was about her, or that photo. It just made me feel happy, it gave me something to hold on to. It only changed from my phone background when I started to make some bad decisions, got into another online relationship to try to fill the void left by my expectations. I surrounded myself with unhealthy people, doing unhealthy things, not taking care of ourselves. After no more than a month that relationship ended. It wasnt good in any metric. I was usurped from that group afterwards, by my ex. Within a week of that happening I got into another relationship, the difference was this girl didnt have any negative traits about herself. I was the dysfunctional one. Spent a week in a mental hospital after a few days of being in that relationship. In that hospital I dont know what exactly it was. I hadnt talked to anyone outside my house for nearly a month. It turned out the person I was roomed with I knew from school a few years prior, and had it not been for him I doubt I would have ever recovered. I think it was on my third day there that he had been discharged and got to go home. That was the first thing I had remembered affecting me since the girl stopped talking to me. A few days later everyone that was at the hospital when I arrived was gone. But there were new people. One of the people that really stuck with me was this guy named Barry, he was unique, he liked jogging and I had bonded to him. When I came back home and was back in school I still felt the sadness of knowing I would never talk to most of the people I met there at that hospital. That feeling never left, and only grew as the days went by. I was still in a relationship with the girl, after two months or so I had to end it. It was no fault of her own but I had issues I needed to resolve and she was a hiding place. When I heard her cry something changed inside me. It made me feel genuinely horrible. It had been nearly a year since I had shown any real emotion. After this I improved an extreme amount with being social at school and reaching out to people. I was still waiting and holding on for the first girl. At one point, I dont ry remember when, she had an abnormally long discussion with me. It only lasted 20 minutes or so but that's the best I could get. She updated me on how her life was, how it was going with her family, troubles with housing, and that she got glasses. Something about her as a person stood out to me. Her getting glasses gave that sense of familiarity it's own personality. While communication from her was more common, it was still very sparse. It wasnt until the end of the school year that she finally talked to me in length. She didnt have much to tell. She said she had made some friends, she had plans to go to a party in a few days. Around this time when she talked to me again I just didnt have the same powerful affection for her. She seemed more like a normal person. It was some 3 days later that she came to me with good news, she had met someone and was in a relationship. Being in the mindset that I was I should have been enraged by this, but I wasnt. I almost felt like I had a duty to make sure what happened to me never happened to anyone else and I conveyed that feeling to her extensively. In the discussion when she told me she found a relationship she told me he was from across the country and was just visiting when this party happened. This made me completely hopeless. The following hours were the closest I have ever been and the closest I will ever be to suicide. Afterwards, sobbing, I layed down and fell asleep. When I woke up I had nothing left to lose. I directed all of that energy into my work. I started modelling, started coding, and started a close knit community of my own. I started to feel genuinely happy. I made plans and went out for the first time in years. I made local friends. And this lead me to meet my SO.

wholesomememes,ffptduy,t1_ffpp57q,1580104999.0,"Ok, I understand, if you arent old enough to drive 99% of males you would be interested in are not going to be that kind of person. Stay away from the edgy kids, but go for someone more reserved as I have found they have better manners. Dont be afraid to just be friends with people and have casual conversation. If the people you are talking to havent explicitly made it clear that their conversation is to build a relationship you arent leading them on. Be painfully honest, be painfully blunt, except when comforting someone or an existing partner. If you have issues within a relationship, dont keep them to yourself. A relationship that is functional where you can voice your concerns and opinions is the type of relationship that will mean the most to you. There is no shame in not liking some things so long as you are considerate of the other party. Never allow unfaithfulness."

Your 'Fixed' texture seems to not have any finish on any of the metal. This can and most likely would lead to rust and abrasion to the working surfaces. Also the grip seems to be some variety of wood. In the majority of 1911's available the grips are some type of polymer as wood at that thickness doesnt always hold up the best. The metal seems to have too much contrast in the detail and it quite dark.

PhantomForces,ffnhl0y,t1_ffhugvk,1580066085.0,"No, a railgun is not an electromagnetic pulse weapon. It is a gun that shoots rails. There are two ways of achieving this with varying success.

The simple way is to have electromagnets set up in a line to pull the metal rod forward in the direction of travel. (this is difficult with the timing of the magnets and safety)

The complicated way which involves a lot more science and math uses two high voltage rods (like really high voltage) that a metal projectile sits on bridging the connection between the two. This short in the circuit at the insanely high voltage will create an electromagnetic field at the connection points which pull the projectile forward at insanely high speeds. This has drawbacks as the rails erode from the voltage as the electricity welds the projectile to the rails.

Side note: the model in game seems to be of the first variety I mentioned."
