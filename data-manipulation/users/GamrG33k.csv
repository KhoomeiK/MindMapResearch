You get looks and judgement then when you DO discipline your child And/Or when if you don't discipline your child. You're dammed if you do, and dammed if you don't.

That said, I do agree with your sentiment.. Sometimes you can tell when a child is just a spoilt bratt, and children definitely need discipline and love in equal amounts"
