YouShouldKnow,ffjf0ph,t1_ffjchhp,1579996868.0,"Don't know if it's a joke but I can tell you that Vinland is where it's said the Vikings explored after landing in 'Markland' aka Labrador/ part of Newfoundland (the first European settlement in North America is at L'Anse aux Meadows). The exact location of Vinland isn't known for certain, but more evidence is mounting that it could be around New Brunswick because the grapevines referenced (and physical evidence found at L'Anse) only grow as far north as New Brunswick, and its relative proximity to NFLD makes it a probable location. Unfortunately, Vinland wasn't a permanent settlement, partly because it was so far from other outposts, and no physical evidence has been found in NB to support it. 

Vinland could also be multiple places, and possibly further down the coast of Atlantic Canada and USA."

I got injured in September and was laid up for almost 3 months. I returned to work and didn't have enough energy to bother with makeup and hair for a while. I didn't realize how much of my self-esteem was affected by looking so tired and sickly all the time—I just didn't feel like myself at all. I'm doing much better now though."

onguardforthee,fff42oy,t1_ffetf3b,1579875158.0,"It depends on the province's regulations, but I know that in some areas, preference is given to kids with some French at home because they already have the support around them to succeed. Issues with French immersion often revolve around exactly how immersed the kids are in the language. It's not enough to only speak French in the classroom to become functionally fluent, so any extra exposure outside will likely lead to better outcomes."
learnart,ffezwfl,t1_ffewj8j,1579871734.0,"I think the size of the eyes and how pronounced they are gives a more cartoon feel. If you want to make it more realistic, study facial proportions and how things like the corner of the eyes line up with the nostrils, and the corners of the mouth should fall close to the middle of the eye. The Loomis method is helpful for that. Also, don't be afraid to darken and define those shadows, it helps define the planes of the face."

He was trying to be kind and supportive but you twisted it into an... I dunno, offense? Then you whip out that you don't like being told what you can and can't say, which yes is your choice, but you turned a nice moment where this guy wants to encourage you into something combative. 

You don't know this guy in person, he doesn't know you but just reading text alone, you come across as oppositional over nothing."
