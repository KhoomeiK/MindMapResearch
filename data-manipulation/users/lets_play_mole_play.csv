A real life Truman Show, where two comedians prank a very gullible, angry man... hilarious and sometimes bizarre and disturbing. 

Lots of celebrity cameos, fan participation and unbelievable storylines. it’s art.

The prank has been running for 27 years, it’s a continuation of the movie Windy City Heat ( https://youtu.be/ancwTUkXyKk ), whose 3 stars are the podcast stars. The podcast continues today as part of Simply Don The Podcast.
