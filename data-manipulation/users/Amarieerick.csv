>!Trubel is Nick's 3rd cousin on his mother's side so there for this reasoning it was still the same Grimm blood in all Grimms. !<"
grimm,ffpmymx,t3_euie34,1580099110.0," Nick's blood cannot cure Juliette because of the connection between Nick, Juliette, and Adalind. ... Nick's blood originally stole Adalind's power. Adalind now has Nick's blood permanently in her system, keeping her from using her own hexenbiest side.  


There were a few episodes where Juliette was likeable, I just couldn't understand all the times she kept things from Nick under the ""Oh he won't understand"" or ""he won't believe this""    even after Nick told her about being a Grimm and the others showed their Wesen side, she still made excuses to hide things."

TwoXChromosomes,ff7jlsr,t1_ff69zrz,1579651087.0,"To piggyback on this, it's not only that they only want old white men to be having sex, they also want to make sure that ""uptight moral Christians"" still have the right to ""tsk tsk tsk"" and judge those whorey little girls who are out having sex and getting pregnant.  If you let the girls have control over their body, they might choose birth control or , they might  choose abortion and take takes one of the  ways that people can cluck their tongue and whisper about them in their morally superior groups."

As you can see the furnace has a small door that can be opened, and in ours there was basically an inverted cone with a flat top that you could put a pan on to heat up things like soup. 

Now I'm sure you really didn't care to have your snarky comment answered but there it is, that's how.  And BTW if you live in a house that doesn't lose the furnace when the electricity goes out, you can set a pan on the floor grate and use the same  **technique to heat up things,** no you can't fry an egg but you can take the chill out of some foods."
MapPorn,fesspl1,t1_feq6v6n,1579368624.0,Ahh yes there is that.

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fepeurb,t1_fepcev0,1579318753.0,Exactly.  And this is something that deserves to be punished at the highest level possible.  I just hate that they didn't bother to explain this to its fullest extent so people understand that while it's definitely needed but that it's not as broad as people want to believe.

Everyone heard ""Trump signed the PACT act and now animal abuse is a federal felony"", what most people missed or what wasn't explained is that this ONLY applies to ""Crushing Videos""  and extends current laws against crushing videos to a federal felony if they are transported across state lines.   


It has absolutely NOTHING to do with the neighbors dog who's outside 24/7, it has nothing to do with breeders or anyone else, its is specific ONLY to crushing videos and the people who make them."
