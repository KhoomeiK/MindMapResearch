Workbenches,ffipz3o,t1_ffi4b5x,1579979821.0,"Lol yeah. I spent about $200 on supplies to build this 3 shelves high. Two shelves go 16 feet long. The top is about 10 feet because of the garage door. I also added jack studs on the front legs and braced between the plywood joints. Used  GRK screws too so this is built like a tank.
