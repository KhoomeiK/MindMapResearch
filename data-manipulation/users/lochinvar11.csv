&nbsp;

Sentiment:

r/BlackPeopleTwitter is one of the most racist subreddits, needing proof that you're black or you'll be removed.

A lot of their posts are ""Country Club Only."", meaning only verified black people are allowed to comment at all. The reasoning is that back in the day, white people got privilege to speak their mind while oppressing the black man. So i guess now it's just payback or something... but it just perpetuates racism in an era where we should be working to eliminate racism instead.

I suppose reddit mods are afraid that if they make them change the rules they'll called racist and have to deal with a lot of backlash."

wowthanksimcured,fdr96qp,t1_fdqa1wi,1578681160.0,"To each their own. 

Saying ""you’ll never be financially ready so you just gotta make it work"" is incredibly stupid. Some people are financially ready, but for those who aren't, they simply can't afford it and won't go into crippling debt just to sight see.

I'm 30, my job send me all over the country and I have the extra money and vacation time to travel on my own as well. And you know what? Other places around the country aren't super different than where you live right now. Half the time you could be on a stay-cation and not know the difference.

To add to this, most pictures you see of people travelling, where everything looks so peaceful and amazing and isolated? It's not really like that. You're seeing edited highlight reels. Just like everyone's life looks amazing in social media but isn't, these trips look amazing but aren't as amazing as they look. 

Don't put yourself into crippling debt for this."
wowthanksimcured,fdr7312,t3_empcrr,1578680377.0,"So lets say you follow this advice and take 6 months off of life to travel and do whatever you want.

Lets assume to fund this, you took a personal loan of $20,000. This covers food, phone, hostels, travel (double the loan amount if you hope to travel out of the country).

At an interest rate of 6% over 10 years to pay back, you'll be looking at paying $26,600 total at $222 per month once you return.

So ""while your young"" you're starting life $26,000 behind.

Also typically ""while you're young"", you'll be in college. Taking 6 months off likely means you'll graduate a full year later. This is a full year of making less than you would if you had stayed in school. ~$20k-$40k.

So now, your travels ""while your young"" have set you back ~$60k, and what have you gained from this?

Yes, while travelling you can see some nice sights, meet all kinds of different people, and not deal with the stress of life for a bit, but once you come back, life is much harder than it was before, all for 6 months of stress free sightseeing.

If you'd spend the same time in school instead, you could have a real career than pays well and gives vacation time. Do your travels during that vacation time and you won't drown yourself in debt. You'd also be building your resume, putting yourself further ahead and closer to an earlier retirement. This education will also teach you how to proofread and spell the word ""than"".

If you live to travel and piss away your future, you'll be a greeter at walmart at 80 years old because you were never able to build a retirement fund properly."
