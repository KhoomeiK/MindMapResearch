todayilearned,ffw3m2h,t1_ffvsk1t,1580282852.0,"> Honestly I'm not sure any president has threaded the needle as perfectly as Lincoln. You had Republicans who wanted full freedom for black folks and Republicans who wanted to deport them to Liberia.

Yes Lincoln really threaded the needle with the many shades of Blue & Grey when it came to slavery and the Civil War in that time you had:

*  On one end you have the Quakers(very huge in the movement), Frederick Douglass, the northern part of the Methodist Church(founder John Wesley denounced human bondage as ""the sum of all villainies"") -- being true abolitionists 

* Many Union soldiers view blacks as inferior and desired the USA to be a white man's country 

* Henry Clay supported and was the President of the American Colonization Society that wanted to do what you mentioned send free blacks back to Africa. He was a slave owner. 

* Some Union Army Generals kept a practice of returning escaped slaves to their masters, particularly democrats such as Generals Henry Halleck, George B. McClellan, and Don Carlos Buell.

* After South Carolina left the Union the AG of South Carolina opposed rebellion saying ""South Carolina is too small for a republic and too large for an insane asylum.""

* Sam Houston who while in office as president of the Republic of Texas and later as governor he refused to permit payments to bounty hunters of escaped slaves. He also prohibited slave ships from trafficking in Texas. He was removed the office of Governor of Texas because he refused to let Texas leave the Union. But in the end supported the land ""for whose defense my blood has been spilt"" aka Texas. He also owned his own slaves. One of his slaves Joshua would take the last name of Houston, visit the family after Sam's death, and named one of his sons after his former owner. Sam also let his slaves keep their outside earnings.   

* Then you have on the other end the Fire-Eaters who urged the rebellion to happen as early as 1850 and they not only wanted slavery in the States but some sought to revive America's participation in the Atlantic slave trade, which had been illegal since 1808. Something that the Confederate Constitution didn't allow, Article I Section 9(1) ""The importation of negroes of the African race from any foreign country, other than the slaveholding States or Territories of the United States of America, is hereby forbidden; and Congress is required to pass such laws as shall effectually prevent the same."""

On the first subject of not being able to manage the land they had. When US forces got into Santa Fe during the Mexican-American War, Colonel Alexander William Doniphan, under the command of Kearny, recovered ammunition from Santa Fe labeled ""Spain 1776"" showing both the lack of communications and quality military support New Mexico received under Mexican rule.

* In 1838, Iowa, while still a territory, allowed unmarried women to own property. At that time, women did not have rights and in most of the U.S. they were considered property themselves.

* In 1846, The same year Iowa became a state, it became the second state in the nation to allow married women to own property (as long as it did not initially come from her husband).

* In 1851, Iowa became the second state to legalize interracial marriage… a century before the rest of America. California legalized it between 1948 and 1967. National it was legalized in 1967. 

* In 1851,  Iowa legislated that the property of married women did not vest in her husband, nor did the husband control his wife’s property.

* In 1857, The University of Iowa became the first state university in the nation to open its degree programs to women.

* In 1860, The Iowa State Supreme Court ruled that a married woman may acquire real and personal property and hold it in her own right.

* In 1868,  Iowa became the second state to outlaw segregated schools… ninety years before the rest of America. The Iowa State Supreme Court ruling was used as cited in Brown v Board of Education

* In 1869,  Iowan Julia C. Addington became the first woman in the United States to be elected to a public office. Within a decade, 75% of the county superintendents in Iowa were women, another first in the nation.

* In 1869, Iowa became the first state to allow women to join the bar, thus setting the stage for having the first female attorney in the U.S., Arabella Mansfield.

* In 1871, Ada E. North became the first woman in the United States to be appointed to a statewide office. She was appointed the Iowa State Librarian.

* In 1875, Emma Haddock of Iowa City became the first female in the United States to practice law before a federal court.

* In 1884, The Iowa Civil Rights Act was passed. It prohibited discrimination in public accommodation. It was one of the first civil rights acts in the nation.

* In 1894, Iowa became the third state in the nation to give women the right to vote.

* In 1934, The first mosque built to be a mosque in the United States is built in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It is now known as the Mother Mosque of America. Cedar Rapids is also the home of the Muslim National Cemetery, the only exclusively Muslim cemetery in the United States.

* In 1949, The Iowa State Supreme Court ruled that Katz Drug Store in Des Moines discriminated against Edna Griffin (an African American, also known as the Rosa Parks of Iowa). It was the first successful enforcement of the Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1884. The ruling was preceded by a boycott of Katz Drug Store in Des Moines by both white and black residents. This boycott occurred seven years before the bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama.
