Advice,fd5lsn8,t3_ek3u39,1578178838.0,"I suffer from the same problem (though in different domains) and although they didn't really help me that much, this is advice I have been given by others (not on Reddit). They might work better for you. I've made them mostly domain-independent.

* **Just start**. When it's a good time, mentally force yourself to start. If it's something you enjoy, starting is probably the biggest hurdle, and once you've started, you should be fine.  

* **Make a 'schedule' and set reminders for that schedule**. If you always start at the same time it'll be easier to start a new habit.  

* If possible, **set frequent small goals for yourself.** Make sure they're really easy to reach. This is again in helping you get started and keep it regular.  

* Try to **reduce prominent distractions.**  

* **Remind yourself why you want to do this.** If you're feeling unmotivated, really think about why it's important to you. This should help you get started again. If you find you're not sure this is really what you want, allow yourself to consider that too, and don't punish yourself for those thoughts should they occur.  

* If possible, **find others who share the same interests/ambitions**, and work towards them together. Social 'obligations' can be a way to both force yourself to do things. They also have the added benefit of growing together and having someone with the same passion to chat with, which can help with motivation."

Wonderful plant! I hope to get my own soon. Say hi to them for me!"
Archery,fd54sro,t1_fd3nfto,1578174169.0,"Unless I don't get what you're asking, usually when people say 'recurve' they mean a recurve bow with a sight, stabilizer, and clicker. 

You can shoot barebow with a 'normal' recurve bow that doesn't have all those extra tools on it."
dataisbeautiful,fd53n9i,t3_ejwlja,1578173891.0,As someone from Europe all these straight borders are really fascinating. I actually like that more than the data that's displayed. :'D
drawing,fd32i3y,t3_ejxose,1578154158.0,"I'd say start with something you're somewhat confident in, if anything.

If nothing, start with something that is inherently forgiving. Rocks, skulls, and insects tend to have interesting shapes to get you back into art without looking bad too quickly. Simple scenery such as sunsets over a beach are easy and have nice and satisfying colours. Also, don't be afraid to use references. In fact, I highly recommend using references to study from. Professionals do it all the time, too.

Once you're more confident in your control over your pen, you can gradually move to more difficult subjects such as animals from the side, and then, when you feel ready, you can try human portraits, but mistakes show very easily there.

Don't be too hard on yourself. Nobody becomes a fantastic artist overnight. As long as you manage to find back your joy in art, improvement will be so much easier! :)"
