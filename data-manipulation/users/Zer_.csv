I got the Reforged Edition on release and I'm fine with it.

I see a lot of people mad at it so I do a bit of digging and find out that a few planned features never made it. Turns out there was a proper Press Release about the change by Blizzard, but Marketing didn't get the memo and still hasn't removed that from the Store Page Feature Set for the game... Well played Blizzard. Shit probably wouldn't be half as bad if they'd kept on the ball and updated their Store Descriptions.

bestof,ffwon85,t1_ffwhh2s,1580307191.0,"> We are also attempting to bring in skilled workers and such, because our healthcare system is in shambles, but we’ve had some trouble getting doctors from overseas to be able to practice in this country.

In shambles is a bit hyperbolic. If you want shambles, take a look at the NHS in Britain. There is a lot of room for improvement, however. It also varies by Province greatly. Quebec has near total coverage, including prescription drugs. All except Dental and expensive Name Brand pills generally covered.

By Contrast, Alberta's is much more threadbare. Though, there is a national minimum at the very least, even though I feel like the entire country should get a more Quebec style plan, ideally including Dental care (even up to ~$600 insurance coverage a year) could cover 2 cleanings a year.

Beyond that, there are definitely areas where improvements need to be made. In Quebec, we have a cap on the number of licenses we distribute to General Practitioners. The very long waiting lists to getting a GP are largely due to that. The system could definitely use some shoring up and some (actually well thought out) systemic redesigns to make it leaner, but also more secure."
DaystromInstitute,ffuj2hg,t3_ev7ju6,1580243010.0,"It's not an Uber Vessel. It's just a very fast ship. Probably fast enough that only a few larger factions really pose any major threat to her if she kept to herself entirely.

In sheer Firepower vs Weight, the Intrepid completely outclasses the Galaxy. That's not the only thing that makes a good ship. The Galaxy is built for projecting power, acting as a mini-Starbase wherever she is stationed. While that would provide some benefits in the Delta Quadrant, it would also provide a lot of negatives.

Voyager was a fast, sleek ship. Not too much cargo space for her size, but enough to hold supplies for an acceptable mission length. So the Galaxy may have it easier at first, due to her vast cargo space. She would definitely be far more supply hungry in the long term. The question is whether the Galaxy's compliment of support craft would help offsetting that increased supply need.

Voyager's sleeker design, fewer amenities and such means that she runs more efficiently when it comes to resource consumption. That's a huge benefit in a place like the Delta Quadrant."
worldnews,fftn1uz,t1_fftjmio,1580224692.0,"Yeah, I'd somewhat agree with you if it were just oceanic acidification.

Large mammals likely wouldn't be able to survive in the long term.

Combine that with the unsustainable loss of insect biomass on land and you have what comes close to a perfect storm.

MensLib,fftloix,t1_ffth8dn,1580223743.0,"> Animals don't socialize the way we do.** Well adjusted hurt humans seek out other safe people when hurt. It's because even if we are going through something unfixable, social contact that feels safe helps us feel calmer and cared for. Think about how in movies the caring family gathers around someone with a hopeless cancer case to offer emotional support even though they can't fix the situation. Men hide because we've been socialized to avoid social support and feelings.

As far as we know** however animals socialize regardless. In fact more recently, we've found some species socialize quite a lot more than initially assumed.  I think people are misrepresenting my words. Nowhere in my post am I saying ""It's all good, it's just a natural thing that happens.""

Issue is, trying to address this without understanding where it came from in the first place could be pretty damaging to society as well. We assume we're taught to keep to ourselves when hurt, address it as such, and fail to address the potential that it's not something that's taught at all, but more instinctual."

DaystromInstitute,ffpuc7v,t3_eui5de,1580106025.0,"It's always most accurate to say there's no *Centralized* currency in the Federation. Administratively, it makes the most sense then to have a barter system, with perhaps a sort of credit system on the side that helps cover any situations where bartering is inadequate.

The Federation likely keeps a fair chunk of cash available, from Latinum  to other currencies used within and outside of Federation space. These would be needed to allow Starfleet Officers to be given small spending allowances. Otherwise, this pool of currency could likely be tapped into when dealing with other factions such as the Ferengi, although we know that The Federation tends to favor bartering, you can't deny its usefulness in certain diplomatic or economic situations.

Honestly, I think there would be quite a lot of currency floating around Federation space. I'd imagine planets such as Earth, in spite of the Federation's lack of currency, likely has an abundance of various currencies flowing through it. Official currency or not, Earth is an economic hub. I'd say an enterprising Ferengi could make a pretty good profit going to Earth at the right time and place."

Games,ffk8ybw,t1_ffk20m0,1580018914.0,Note that this is just a guideline. The value of PLEX changes. EVE is a virtual economy.

Games,ffk8ji9,t1_ffk0evn,1580018713.0,"In short, the players/developers are doing so jointly. I think it's false to just say ""the developers"" or ""the players"".

When you look at EVE like a self contained nation, then you can understand what it's about. PLEX is something you can buy for real money to sell for in-game currency, or use PLEX to purchase in-game subscription time or cosmetic items. You can play for free, however having a Subscription offer you far more economic opportunities in game.

In short that means that in-game currency (ISK) has real life monetary value. All those past articles about huge battles in EVE that cost ""Thousands of dollars worth of ships"" literally means it costs that much to wage large scale war in EVE.

EVE is a (largely) self contained economy."
