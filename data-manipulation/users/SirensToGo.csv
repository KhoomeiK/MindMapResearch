berkeley,ffpwv57,t3_euh4yd,1580108900.0,"Can't speak to others or say which one, but at least that the one I'm in intentionally takes steps to prevent you from using any sort of connections by assigning your essays and resume to an interviewer who doesn't know you. Nobody likes nepotism and it's not a good look anyways. 

Some clubs track interest through a google form or something like that at their info sessions but generally that doesn't seem to be a major factor. I do still recommend going to the member meet and greets though (even if you don't believe they are tracked) because if you think all the members are dicks there's no point in joining. For the most part, getting an interview is purely based on your resume and essays. Resume wise, as a freshman nobody expects you to have an internship under your belt. Cool projects though are always a plus! After the first essay and resume hurdle though, it's based on how you behave/if they vibe with you which is a lot more difficult to give specific advice for.

How far in the process did you make it last semester in most clubs? If you got cut before the interviews, the answer is obviously to work a bit on your essays and pick more interesting/honest answers as well as to hone your resume so your work really pops. If you find yourself getting cut at the ""coffee chat"" stage, my only advice would be to chill out. Remember that your interviewers are Berkeley students too (some are even freshmen!) and that if you get in you'll be hanging out with them. Be casual, be fun! The worst thing you can do is treat it like it's a job interview (hence calling it a coffee chat and NOT an interview). Be kind and treat it like a conversation with some randoms you just sat down with at a lecture."

My procedure, step by step:

1. Punch where I need to go in to google maps. Use the arriving/departing time as needed so I get to where I need to on time or leave when I can. Google will handle all the scheduling you need, don't need to think hard about this. Some people use the Transit app but it isn't very good compared to Google Maps in terms of actually having bus data for whatever reason. Each stop also has a list of timetables on the bus stop post but they're less useful since AC transit it reliably late/early. 
2. When you get on the bus, have your clipper card out and scan it against the reader thing. It's electronic and makes a loud screaming noise when it works. You need to have your clipper card completely separate from any other cards or you phone (iPhones will mess it up). The reader says something about it costing $2.50 but it doesn't actually charge you anything. No idea what it's about but it might just be how they implemented the thing.
3. Sit or stand somewhere. General spidey sense about ""this dude looks funky"" is good. Sitting up near the driver late at night is also good if you're easily spooked/a likely target like me. In 

Since you're asking about the basic, it's worth knowing that BART costs extra money. The only times I've used it is for SF which cost me about $5 each way. You can load it online/setup autoload or load balance at the station. You get charged when you *exit* the station (and getting stuck in the station when you're trying to catch a flight is a fat L) so I really recommend autoload because having to go and furiously load cash on your card sucks. Again, for BART use Google Maps. The colors (""yellow"" and ""orange"") are meaningless AFAIK because the trains all look the same. On the light up boards it'll flash the train name when it arrives.
