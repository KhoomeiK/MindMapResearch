OpenChristian,fgsfmw9,t1_fgrt0cw,1581083013.0,Yeah I'm afraid I dont understand.
OpenChristian,fgrsdwx,t1_fgrr5i6,1581055893.0,"So, to clarify, all humans are participating equally in this project and we either succeed or fail in our portion together?"
truechildfree,fgrpsjl,t3_f02rc5,1581053525.0,"I adore playing with my friends' and cousins' kids.  They're fabulous and I love being an auntie Tony best friend's children.  Doesn't mean I want any of my own.. at least, not small ones.  I might give an older kid who needs it a home if I ever am financially stable enough.

And that other sub is *toxic*.  I had to leave it almost immediately.  Kids may not be for you, but they are for some and they certainly don't deserve to be hated for simply existing!"
talesfromcallcenters,fgrp4yn,t3_f033fl,1581052941.0,Did he actually admit to threatening you/your office?  What a stupid person.  Like that will ever end well.
Nicegirls,fgrowxm,t1_fgrmfra,1581052748.0,Made me laugh
EntitledBitch,fgrlolx,t3_ezvs4q,1581050069.0,Never heard of this guy.  Sounds like I havent missed much.
OpenChristian,fgqcag8,t1_fgq968h,1581021616.0,"I've never even heard of that idea, project spirituality.  Care to expand?"
Type1Diabetes,fgqbxj8,t3_ezsc33,1581021446.0,"I rotate a lot, but I've had it for 25 years and there are definitely build ups that will (probably) never leave.  That said, I've lost 15 lbs in the last three months, and my stomach and abs are probably the most noticable area.  So that kind of gives me hope that maybe those hard spots may too!"
talesfromcallcenters,fgq85vk,t1_fgq2umq,1581019657.0,You always have a back up plan even when things go smoothly.
Type1Diabetes,fgq3ob2,t1_fgq1vf1,1581017269.0,"Lol fair enough... I cant focus if my hands arent busy.  I always either brought food, a crochet project, or used a coloring app on my ipad.  I never got in trouble as I always sat as far to the side as possible so as not to be a distraction, and participated in class.  Got some weird looks, but people got used to me :D"
Type1Diabetes,fgq1mly,t3_ezw478,1581016160.0,"I’ve had t1 for 25 years and never had a pump.  I work outside with kids and animals and I feel like there is too much risk for it getting pulled out or damaged.  I hear a lot of people say it works better, but I’ve also heard of cases where it just stopped working randomly...
I can’t afford one anyway so that has been the biggest factor in my never having tried it.  But if you can, it seems like it might be worth a go.  Could always switch back if you don’t love it."
Type1Diabetes,fgq1bk2,t1_fgpyx2a,1581015990.0,"Off topic, but did your classmates not eat the entire time?  My entire college classes did haha"

HumansBeingBros,fgq0vwe,t1_fgpqs3n,1581015751.0,"Actually it can... just chase a two year old down the aisle who can run (and escape) really fast and have him also accidentally get too close and see ALL THE BUTTONS.

Yes, this happened to me with my nephew.  He escaped while his mom and I were trying to manage his baby sister who was hungry and needed a diaper change."
LifeProTips,fgq0ca7,t1_fgpwoil,1581015452.0,"I did retail for five years lol... getting out of it was one of the best decisions I ever made.  I will say though, three of those five were in a hardware store which was considerably better than the “regular” consumer stores I also worked in.

Being outside and moving keeps me far happier than anything else a job could offer!"
AskReddit,fgpu5jd,t1_fgpmuv9,1581012059.0,Also followed.   You're fantastic
CasualConversation,fgpsbhv,t1_fgp6kft,1581011040.0,I'm so sorry you're experiencing that.
CasualConversation,fgps5oe,t1_fgp482a,1581010953.0,"That's crazy haha.  ""Oops, sorry I forgot to tell you about Ron.  How long do you have?"""
CasualConversation,fgps1ez,t1_fgoxldq,1581010888.0,"They probably are thinking the same thing!  If Facebook doesn't work, there are other options :) I've reconnected with people from my past and I was always the one to step out first, but in several cases the effort back was 100% matched.  It's a great feeling."
CasualConversation,fgprt9o,t1_fgpbu7h,1581010764.0,My friends range from teenagers to in their 70s and 80s... a broad range is great!
LifeProTips,fgpqm5g,t1_fgowwak,1581010098.0,You have single-handedly convinced me to never work in an office except to log field data (if I have to).  That sounds atrocious.  I'll keep my tight team and outside job even if I never make good money lol.
AskReddit,fgoqbtb,t1_fgomjvc,1580981350.0,What about non-professional circumstances though?
LifeProTips,fgoq8k4,t1_fgopqcy,1580981220.0,"I’m currently working as a tour guide and musher for dogsledding tours.  It is relaxed in some ways, but also stringent in that we have to keep all our guests and dogs safe and happy every day... this creates a kind of bond I haven’t experienced before, and I’ve worked at a lot of tourist places that were chill."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fgonkr9,t1_fgome6i,1580977413.0,She is Mongolian.  There's a link to the source farther up.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fgoni2k,t3_ezfskn,1580977312.0,It is a life dream to visit Mongolia.  It's so different from everything I know.
LifeProTips,fgonalp,t1_fgohnsi,1580977035.0,"Is this just a corporate thing?  I've always worked blue collar jobs and the more ""out of an office"" (so to speak) the more I have to trust my coworkers and we become friends simply through having to rely on each other to keep ourselves and our clients safe and happy.

I work outside now, in a heavy mix of tourism and science, and have for a number of years.  I just don't really understand the office protocol.  It sounds very cutthroat and depressing.  I think being friend with your coworkers is the main way to make work more enjoyable..."
LifeProTips,fgomshi,t1_fgolg80,1580976360.0,"That poor guy.  Was probably keen on the field too, and got snuffed out right in the beginning."
