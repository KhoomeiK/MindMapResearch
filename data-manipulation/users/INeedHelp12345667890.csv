I have cheated myself and I regret it every day. It was by no means okay and *i had no right to do what I did to the person I did it to* that being said also helped me realize that the relationship was not one I committed to and I didn’t want to be in. So I admitted my wrong doing and I left the relationship. I think if I had just grown up and acted like an adult and left it before hand it would have saved a lot of hardship."

personalfinance,fdkecso,t1_fdke3a1,1578502075.0,I called them on Monday to tell them I wasnâ€™t going to be able to pay until Friday. They had put a notice on my door on Tuesday that said if I did not pay the charges in full by Friday that they would practice their lock out rights and if I wanted to regain access to my apartment I could after I paid the unpaid balance. Iâ€™ve never been in this situation so I have no idea how it works.

Iâ€™m currently searching Craigslist and Facebook for small jobs I can do today, as itâ€™s fortunately my day off but I go back for 12 hour shifts tomorrow. 

I hope my landlord will be reasonable though last time I asked, they said they had no way to alter the amount I have to pay as itâ€™s all done online and with debt card now."

relationships,fcz9d2x,t3_ejgs7n,1578096306.0,"Okay so I actually just got out a relationship because of this situation. However, I would and still would consider being with him if he sought out help. Basically I let my best friend move in with me, and it brought us a lot closer and we fell in love. When I tell you we fell in love I mean deeply. I always had feelings for him, and him for me but I didnâ€™t ever know about it and when I finally confessed mine to him our relationship really took off. It was amazing at first, we did so much together laughed, wrestled, cuddled, discovered new things, encouraged each other and everything in between. My boyfriend had lost his job very suddenly because he had went off on an employee for talking about his Korean mother a certain way. He apologized but his job fired him anyways, saying the job was too high stress. (He worked on pharmaceuticals) it was a job he was really happy with and made him feel important, whole. And when he was fired everything changed. I continued to encourage him as much as I could but it was apparent something was off. He was less active with me, spent a lot of time away from me playing video games, we stopped eating meals together, and he even started sleeping on the couch which devastated me. I tried to talk to him about it but he always told me he was fine. I understood his pride was hurt and he was beginning to slip into a depression. This started going on for MONTHS. However things got worse, he started getting really angry, heâ€™d often take it out on me and snap at me for extremely small things. A lot of times it was to the point that I was in tears then he would belittle me for crying. He started to make me feel horrible about things about myself and when we did have sex it became very one sided and almost every time he HAD to watch porn during it. Sometimes to the point that he wasnâ€™t even paying attention to me anymore and was completely focused on the porn. It killed me inside and made me feel extremely ugly. I spent a year begging him to go to counseling, I was supporting him fully, financially, and mentally and I cooked and cleaned and cared for him sometimes spending hours just massaging him so heâ€™d feel better. A year later I had finally snapped, I had enough, I was lonely, tired, frustrated, and I was growing to dread coming home from work to be with him. I kicked him out and told him he needed to work on himself and I needed to work on myself as well because I was extremely unhappy. He reacted by physically shoving me down into the ground, calling me all kinds of horrible names, and he tore my clothes, and destroyed my stuff and mocked me in front of the friend who came to pick him up while I was sobbing. 

Since having left him I still miss him a lot but things are getting better. Like I said I would probably take him back, not right now, but years into the future if he got the help he needed. I always just wanted what was best for him and he refused to help himself. Iâ€™m not sure how heâ€™s doing as he still hasnâ€™t talked to me, but I hope heâ€™s doing okay.....

I guess the point of this VERY long comment is this: 

If something significant happened in his life that could have hurt his pride or even caused some depression, or if he already maybe has depression or anxiety, or something like that I would suggest asking him to seek help. If you arenâ€™t sure, I would just straight up lay it out. Ask him if something is bothering him, if heâ€™s feeling okay, use the differences as points as to why you would ask these questions because he may get defensive. If he refuses to change his behavior and itâ€™s CONSISTENTLY making you unhappy on a day to day basis. If you feel like you are starting to resent him it may be time to let go. Iâ€™m sorry about your experiences and I hope this is a little helpful!"

BreakUps,fcamtrm,t3_egrv25,1577572374.0,"I donâ€™t agree with this. My last break up was me getting the courage to leave someone who emotionally blackmailed me, called me horrible names, broke down my self esteem on a daily basis, and someone I gave everything including my heart to. I encouraged them to do what they liked, follow their passions and dreams and they choose otherwise. I let them go not only for my mental and physical health but for their own mental health. I still love them to death and itâ€™s taking a HUGE amount of healing to move on and learn to be myself again. I dumped them, I fight myself on a daily basis about it and I still care deeply for them and hope they get the help they need to get over the past issues that have hurt them to the point where they projected it on me."
