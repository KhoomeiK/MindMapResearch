Showerthoughts,ffiqc8m,t1_ffinrib,1579980075.0,I feel like this is a silly argument as we don’t know how the physics would actually work. What if we figured out how to actually teleport every atom. Like surely we would know we we just destroying all the atoms and recreating different ones and would be like nah maybe not.
philosophy,ffhtchu,t1_fffq8vs,1579952875.0,"What if you could experience another’s reality through peering into their brain. Would that viewpoint of reality proof to you it exists? and that you have an incomplete version of it?

It seems reality is quite explainable in some regards. I can describe my experiences and recreate a lot of them in computers/video games so it feels kind of like it obviously exists it’s just you don’t have the words to describe it accurately because well it’s not words. Reality is the carving of the senses. The bending of light and sound with math, and we’re just machine learning algorithms that can understand things by staring at patterns. When you look at a chair, you do not think it is a chair because there is something intrinsically that makes it a chair but because you were told a thousand times objects with those shapes are known as chairs. The reason your reality is incomplete is because from another’s perspective they could have been taught that the chair is actually a wall and there’d see a wall where you see a chair.


Reality is a constructable thing, if you want to understand it don’t spend your life philosophising it, just learn how to create it yourself. It’s easier than you think. Learn to code."

PS4Dreams,fdk349q,t1_fdgdgzo,1578494894.0,"Design speed is fasted out of any engine, it has every type of role incorporated perfectly, sound, programming, art into the same system. Where in others you kind of put all these different systems together from different sources. The UI is so much better than other software, while others might be put off by it’s childish style I’d say it’s hyper understandable and clean. I was making my first game by the end of the day. The asset sharing is built into a social media. People actually have a reason to submit assets as they get followers and likes in return. These followers aren’t just for your assets to, it means they’ll see you games too. There’s 10x more assets than unity already, better quality and all free. The assets are far more likely to fit your game and work properly, there’s no hassle setting them up. I’d say the sculpting tools are the best I’ve ever seen and make 3D modelling which is usually so time consuming, as easy as doodling with a pencil. The programming is incredible powerful and yet you only have to learn like 8 things to be able to do it. My little 13 year old brother made a pick axe mining game for the VR controllers. He made a garden, a cave mine to go into, the ability to switch to a flash light from the pick axe, breakable blocks with gold in them and a shop. He was talking about making a randomly generated dungeon when I left. He made it all in a day in a couple hours. It looked as good as most current VR titles. That’s insane."

PS4Dreams,fde7v9n,t1_fddm3lf,1578333101.0,"Dreams does far to many things better than other game engines for them not to adapt to it in some way I think. Yes AAA game companies won’t be as interested as they’ve achieved a higher level of design than Dreams makes possible but in my opinion AAA game design is stale as old bread. They pump out the same games with better graphics each year and I’m tired of it. I’ll bet ya a penny that 10 years from now, the games people will play will be the innovative exciting ones and right now that ain’t where the old gaming industry is headed. 

Plus the stand out part of Dreams is that you can share and use so many of other peoples assets.  Just imagine how many assets will be available in 4 years. The games will get grander and grander and easier and easier with time. I think the difference is a million minds are pouring there hearts into this, even a team of 100 of the most talented game makers ain’t gonna last long against that."
