MtSAC,fge8z0f,t3_eflx2a,1580694084.0,"i believe you only get financial aid for fall and spring course. The BOG waiver should cover your winter course though, but you won't get any of your grant. That's why you usually get it all during fall to save towards winter. 

someone did say though your winter course counts towards your spring course for full student. so since you took 7 units for winter, you only need 5 units to be seen as full term. so i have heard, don't take my word for it. it's best to call or go to the financial aid office."
TenantHelp,fg7gnym,t1_fg7g87p,1580592056.0,"Honestly I was ready to pay the whole time while waiting for the bill. I'm just more mad it was sent directly to a dent collector. I've been having issues with them all year. They continuously lied to me about a lot of things which got me to pay more money,and even then I just wanted to leave and have nothing to do with them. But them not trying to contact me and claiming they mailed a letter, I feel like this was on purpose/ill intent.  They didn't even apologize for anything. Maybe I just want Justice for me and the others they have done this too. I'm just going to pay and leave a bad review about everything so hopefully no one else falls victim to them. My dad lived at the sister location and they treated him the same way. I moved into a more expensive apartment just to escape that place."
legaladvice,fg16ru8,t1_ffc7lwr,1580421848.0,"So I emailed it to them to make sure they got my statement. This is what I received back.

""I am in receipt of the attached documents, and I will reiterate what I disclosed in our conversation yesterday, that your documents were mailed out via USPS on December 5, 2019. This puts us in complete compliance with the law in regards to the notification of the reconciliation of the security deposit for 28D. I have attached a copy of the documents that were mailed to you. These documents were also forwarded to Kimball, Tirey and St. John for them to begin the collection process of the balance due.
As I advised yesterday, you will need to speak directly with the Account Manager assigned to your case with any communication going forward. I have included the Account Manager, Adam Willard,  in this email and I would recommend that you contact him at your next possible convenience in order to take care of the balance due.
Adam has been made fully aware of your situation and if he is in need further information, he can contact me directly. Please be aware that all communications will need to go through Adam.""

I then emailed both this account manager and the head Manager for the apartment complex asking ""Adam did not respond to me, so i will put what i sent him here.

I would like to know then why I did not receive any calls or emails about the balance due, like previous tenants got? You claim this letter was mailed out during December, an extremely busy time of year where mail constantly gets lost. I personally feel like it was bad faith and ill intent for not getting any Courtesy calls. Your company had three different phone numbers and emails. Yet not one of us received anything. I see in reviews for your company that this happened to another family where they did not receive any email, mail, nor a phone call and was sent to collectors. Another family didn't receive anything until the day it was due where they received a courtesy call. 
I had gone into the office sometime in December to pick up a package, and i had called about a package. At those times, I could have been asked if I had received the move-out statement.""

But neither of them will respond to me. I sent it first to Adam on Thursday, and I sent this again to the other manager I was talking with earlier. 
I'm baffled by this now. Should I just go pay the debt or keep trying to talk to them?"
kia,fg0sna0,t1_fg00jzd,1580414230.0,It's been at the dealership this whole time on hold.
kia,ffxi338,t1_ffxhgxg,1580325583.0,I first made a case vis their Kia support team. I wrote about what was happening to my Kia and how it should still be under warranty. I waited a few days then called Kia support. I talked about my Kia with them and explained everything. Each time someone couldn't help me I kept going up and up. Finally I got a head Manager for the region. It took a long time honestly.
college,ffw3mlg,t1_ffux0f6,1580282868.0,"I also took 7 years off. I'm 25 and first year of college. Personally though, I like this. When I was fresh out of high school, I didn't want to do any homework or cared for school. Now that I'm 25, I'm taking my general Ed but choosing courses that help my everyday life."
legaladvice,ffw3j4o,t1_ffvqkxe,1580282754.0,"I agree with this. Keep a paper trail. Don't talk face to face about issues, email them always be. Bathroom breaks, ask again about your hours. And email each manager so you can have all of their responses."
kia,ffw3b65,t3_evao8s,1580282481.0,"I was having engine problems with my 2014 Kia cadenza. Was at a 3rd party mechanic who said it seemed like a defectes engine because the threading for it was loose when it shouldn't be. Been arguing with Kia for 6 months and got them to agree to pay for some of my new engine out of ""good faith"" because my warranty expired 11 days after I took it to the shop. (Even though I had prood the issue was before my warranty expired). I would say talk with Kia and keep arguing for someone above."
legaladvice,ffaiz23,t1_ffab644,1579736881.0,"Thank you for your help. I decided to use the website to form a demand letter from them for not providing me any move out statement before sending it to the debt collectors. Now all i can do is sit nervously and wait. I first emailed it to them, stating i will also mail out a physical copy for them too. god im stressed."
legaladvice,ffaa3gd,t1_ffa9p2q,1579730847.0,"I updated my address, which is across the street from them. My phone number has never changed not has my email. 
Thank you so much for the response. My question is how do I show proof that I never got the letter? Even though the manager said it could of gotten lost, wouldn't they assume I'm lying?"

college,feinyct,t3_epchz8,1579142964.0,"As a very open and outgoing person, i do hope you can make some friends. Though I have no advice for such a situation, i do offer my online friendship. If you have a discord, you can add me. :) I'm a huge gamer, and maybe talking to someone online can slowly help you build to talk to people outside.
