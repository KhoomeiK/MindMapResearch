Deaf people who have ASL as a first language and English as a second tend to have minor— and I mean minor— difficulties with English grammar. Usually it’s more just spelling mishaps, but I’m friends with some who will text in semi sign language grammar. Generally, it’s simply cause their first language is ASL, not English. 

Source: I lived with and worked with deaf people in a religious/humanitarian captaincy and these are just my observations is all lol."
