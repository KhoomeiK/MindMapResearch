I am 5 years out from a 20 year marriage with children. Like you I lost a ridiculous amount of weight, immediately divorced, and got very healthy physically and emotionally in about 2 years time.  

You have succinctly distilled what a person needs to do to heal. Move to make your abuser your ex ASAFP, followed by limited (or ideally no) contact with said ex (that includes your brain! Yes it takes practice)

Stoked to see you doing well!"
survivinginfidelity,fest68y,t1_feqpuyt,1579368783.0,Sorry for the confusion. It was a dealbreaker for me and there was no sex after d-day. Divorce was final 6 months later. Still took me a couple of years to gain perspective. (20 year marriage).

WTF,femwdfx,t1_femrjm5,1579271344.0,Nah it's definitely an empty food dish. So whatever is down there is probably very hungry. It might be a good idea to bring someone who runs more slowly than you! ;-)

survivinginfidelity,fdwnn5q,t1_fdu02qb,1578760561.0,">I think it's time for me to step back and focus on myself and the boy.

You have it right there. Please devote your energy to where it belongs and is of use. 

For multiple reasons, your ex is not a reliable or safe partner or parent. That has never really been under your control, and you can't fix her. She might get her shit together, and then again she might not. In the meantime, the best thing you can do for her is to save yourself and the boy. That means taking care of yourself and him by having the absolute minimum possible contact with her. 

Best of luck to you, Dad."

survivinginfidelity,fcole5r,t3_ei9oqz,1577835162.0,"Not dumb at all!

Ask yourself this: What in the last couple of months has she done to make herself a worthy partner for you?

Answer: Not a damn thing. She just found out the grass wasn't quite so green.

Edit: I know it's hard, and she's pulling all the classic manipulative moves with the old pictures and so forth. She's your ex for a damn good reason."
