Some show nudes, some show light coverings (like swimsuits/leotards), some are graphic and show the muscles and planes. All of them help.

Try quickposes.com or posemaniacs.com. On youtube, newmastersacademy and ""draw this"" both have timed sessions with models for drawing. 

Those body-kun models do well in a pinch if you can afford one, because it gives you that practice of drawing from life as opposed from a flat screen like a computer, video or photograph. 

Good luck with it."

13ReasonsWhy,fetd8sr,t3_eq79x5,1579374136.0,"I don't think this will happen mainly because of the statement Mrs. Baker made to Clay in S3 about how Hannah lost sight of her most important instinct: survival. And she tells Clay to ""survive this."" 

IMO, Clay was designed to be a counter to Hannah, so I don't think the series will let him succumb. He has to survive to send out a message that you *can* survive. 

Also, I do think S4 is going to be about how the bonds fracture, and how it becomes every man for himself.  Which is like a mirror of Hannah's relationships in S1/2.  In S1/2, Hannah (and Clay) learned there is no such thing as loyalty and people's decisions are self-serving. Some weren't deliberately trying to hurt Hannah or anyone else, but their own selves take priority over someone else.

I think that will happen again in S4, as everybody has something to lose here again. Clay's greatest strength is his loyalty. He actually *would* sacrifice himself for others. So the question I'm waiting to have answered is whether they will decide if these characters from S1/S2 have learned to be loyal over self-serving or if Clay will learn to let toxic people go for his own self-preservation? That's my take on it anyway."

13ReasonsWhy,fdwrb9e,t3_emh935,1578761574.0,"I'm specifically annoyed by the presentation the show gave to Bryce breaking Zach's leg vs Zach breaking Bryce's leg. 

They treat Zach's broken leg like a minor inconvenience, and a 'boys will be boy's' kind of encounter. Zach is patched up and back on his feet within hours, whereas they really drag out Bryce's injury, making sure to add a nice crunchy sound effect to the break, and letting Bryce moan about it endlessly. As such, the viewer interprets Bryce's break as a significant injury and virtually forgets Bryce even touched Zach.

This sort of treatment is evident in several instances throughout the 3rd season, and it peeves me to no end.  One of the most major complaints I have regarding the storytelling in this show."

ArtCrit,fdwad5n,t3_en6gea,1578756707.0,"This is a really cool and powerful piece. I agree with others that the background colors should be toned down. That will help them recede into the back where they belong. Same with the ribbon (they look like arms/hands, are they? If so, it's really cool). But I'd make the ribbon in back a slightly muted red so you can see the space between the two ends. 

You also could add a drop shadow on the figure or change the weight of the texture on the background (make the linework thinner, as right now the linework is the same weight as the figure). 

Just some ideas to play around with it. I really like it!

Edit: If you're looking to salvage this particular piece, you might consider repainting the figure on another material and attaching it back onto the piece with something like foamcore to give it a 3D look."

television,fcm15y6,t3_eghdau,1577761534.0,"So, I’ve made it to episode 3 and I can say it’s pretty objectively bad. I’m not familiar with the source material. Literally the only thing I knew about Witcher before watching was that it was an internet meme: “Witcher 3” and I’m not even concretely positive what the meme was about. I watched episode 1 and thought it was good but, 

The show does feel like an Encyclopedia of Witcher where they had a checklist of canon bits they needed to check off one by one. And it feels like - I don’t play games - but I think they still have little “movies“ that play in between levels to advance the plot, yes? So it feels like a collection of those little movies strung together but without the narrative that was supposed to go in between. I did have to keep checking that I didn’t miss an episode because it seemed like giant leaps in plot happened off screen and new characters appeared out of nowhere that we are presumably already supposed to know. I’ll probably finish but it might be a bit of a slog."

Your comment made me think back to an online class I took by [Steve Huston](https://www.trojan-unicorn.com/main-event/knights/steve-huston/thu-2017), where he argued for signing and dating all your sketches and to fight, if you can, against that urge to scribble a drawing out and write yourself nasty notes about it in the margin, explaining how that action is a measure we take to protect our ego so that some stranger doesn't get the wrong idea and think we (as the artist) might have considered that piece, God forbid, actually *good*.

But there was Jon, not only buying into it, but happily spreading about that absolute fertilizer like a farmer sowing seed. 

I get the guy really likes his pals and would find it hard to believe the worst, but history is filled with ""otherwise good people"" who did terrible things and/or allowed terrible things to happen so long as their own bread continued to get buttered - and the real disappointment is realizing that even guys like Jon Stewart can't see the forest for the trees when they find themselves too emotionally connected to a particular issue.
