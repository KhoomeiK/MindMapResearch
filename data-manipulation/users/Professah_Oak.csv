forestry,ffapvxw,t3_eshnvt,1579741706.0,"I've had a standard 362 for seven or eight years and have put a few hundred hours on it. I discovered the spark plug hole was cross-threaded just after any hope of a warranty solution, so I helicoiled it and have had no problems since. I used it for bucking 2-3' Douglas-fir when I was working in the west, but find only occasional need for it since moving back east. I run a 261 mostly, but I really do like the saw and keep it around for when I need to cut something big.  


I sometimes run a 441 and find it feels a lot heavier with a 20"" bar vs. my 362 with 25"" bar. I like my 362 more every time I run the 441."
Professors,ff4w1oa,t1_ff4fx36,1579573812.0,"I would think it fair if the cheating were reported and that official record taken as disqualifying. Likewise your example of not hiring convicted rapists to watch the kids--good call. What I have a problem with is a faculty member classifying an academic offense as so minor as to warrant no official follow up or record, but then following up with further punishment on an ongoing basis without the support of documentation. Some crimes are disqualifying, but those need to be documented officially and open to appeal, not kept in the personal memory of the professor. 

That said I don't know if you could access those records to make hiring decisions or not, so maybe it's for nothing. 

We are coached to make faculty hiring decisions based on the verifiable facts and responses to standardized interview questions, but I have also seen decades of personal history and hearsay get dragged into it. We are told that this can and has been the basis of legal action against the school, but have not been given the details."

My short two cents: stand dynamics and climate change together are more than the sum of their parts, and nothing in modern ecology happens without the influence of both.   


As far as I know pine beetle has not achieved two full generations in a year in BC or elsewhere. [Mitton and Ferrenberg's](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/665007?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) paper on that subject was from the Colorado front range, and was rebutted by [Bentz and Powell](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_journals/2014/rmrs_2014_bentz_b002.pdf), and with the following [response from the original authors.](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/678404) I think their disagreement came down to what defines a generation in a situation where individual beetles and their offspring cannot be traced."

If memory serves, BC classifies its fire-adapted forest types as ""maintained by fire"" meaning a regime of low-intensity ground fires consumed accumulated fuel on a regular basis without killing most of the mature trees, and ""replaced by fire"" meaning the fires tended to kill the mature cohort and make way for reproduction. Ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forest types at the grassland interface are examples of the former; lodgepole pine is the classic example of the latter.   


50-100 years of fire exclusion led to an unusually high amount of fuel accumulated in the former type, leading to catastrophic crown fires killing all trees (see Williams Lake 2017), and an unusually high amount of mature forest in the boreal (to the benefit of the mountain pine beetle, which prefers this situation).   


Australia's forest types also have extensive natural history with fire, and a recent history of fire exclusion, but their fuel loads seem to come back faster than we would expect in our temperate forests according to these papers:
