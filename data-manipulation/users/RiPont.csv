This is the fundamental breakdown in reasonable discussion with anti-gun proponents.  You simply cannot get them to agree on nearly anything as a valid Defensive Gun Use.

1. A shot was fired.

2. Police were involved and there was a police report.

3. The shooter was 100% clearly in the right and was not charged with anything so much as a traffic violation themselves.

4. The shooter wasn't off-duty or retired law-enforcement, as that doesn't count for some reason.

5. The recipient of the shot was human.  Self-defense against animals also doesn't count, for some reason.

The justification is that these numbers are ""hard"" evidence, whereas most other DGUs are ""anecdotal"".  While true, it doesn't mean that the non-recorded (in a way that can be easily tallied) DGUs didn't happen, it means that the recorded ones are the baseline minimum number for DGUs, whereas we *just don't know* the real number, but we know that it's higher.

We'll just have to agree to disagree, there.  Burying plastic is just not sustainable at the levels of plastic waste we're generating.  Furthermore, it contaminates the ground.  Burying plastic with the rigor and safety we plan for nuclear waste would be very expensive.  Burying it with something in between ""dig a hole anywhere"" and nuclear waste safety would quickly become another situation we have now with recycling, where a few places would initially welcome the business, then realize that it was terrible environmental disaster for their local area and stop taking it.

> Are you referring to recycling?

No.  Not for plastic, not in volume.  There's a small market for recyclable plastic of specific types, but the viable market for recycled plastic barely scratches the surface of the plastic problem.  Furthermore, there are so many different types of plastic, it's functionally impossible for consumers to recycle it properly.  We bought into the plastic recycling lie because China let us conveniently toss everything in one bin and ship it to them, but those days are over.  Some small amount of plastic recycling might still have a niche, especially if we can tag the recyclable plastic with a UV dye or something so that it can be automatically extracted from the waste pipeline, but that's not a solution for plastic waste in general.

> It depends on the reason for taxation. Are you suggesting a tax to raise funds to further provide public goods? Then we can discuss the merits of such a thing. Are you imposing a tax simply to punish people for doing things you don't want them to or simply to take money from people you don't want to have money? That's a problem.

I'm not proposing a tax for punishment, I'm proposing a tax to capture the direct cost to society that is being hidden.  ""Digging a hole and burying it"" has a direct social cost in loss of land, contamination of land, smell that reduces real-estate values nearby, possible contamination of waste water, etc.

The vast majority of plastic packaging is completely unnecessary, and is only economically competitive because the cost of processing the waste is hidden from the consumer.  The consumer would end up *not* paying much more, because the economic incentive would shift towards more reasonable packaging.

We're already at a crisis in waste disposal since China stopped taking our trash.  We shopped around a few other countries, but they come to the conclusion that it's a disaster much more quickly than China did.  Make no mistake, the consumer *will* be paying the true cost of disposal in the US soon, one way or another.  Unfortunately, it'll likely be a painful transition of waste management companies hiking rates, municipalities trying to pass laws preventing them from hiking rates, and so on back and forth until we finally admit that the days of cheap garbage disposal are over."

All GUIs must translate between the idealized data model (e.g. Person.Name.SurName etc.) and the view, which is made up of Buttons and TextBoxes and other UI-specific classes which have nothing to do with the problem domain (as their problem domain is UI).

The old way of doing this was to directly set properties of the view objects in code.

    form1.TextBox1.Text = person1.Name.SurName + "", "" + person1.Name.GivenName + "" "" + person1.Name.MiddleName[0];

This gets very verbose, very fast.  Your syntax above is more declarative, but still functionally the same.  State changes would happen with an Event-driven model, and also got exponentially more complicated as the complexity of the domain model and view increased.

The XAML world uses declarative syntax in XML to do the data binding to the model, but that's just trading one syntax for another and not really changing the complexity.

MVVM simply adds the ""ViewModel"" in between the view and the domain model.  The ViewModel is an idealized (and simplified) model *of the UI*.  The View no longer needs to be aware of any of the complexity or specifics of the domain model.  `form1.TextBox1.Text` binds directly to a `DisplayName` property, without caring that the DisplayName is a composite of various pieces of the person's name.  The ViewModel contains all the complexity of notifying the UI of changes and receiving changes from the UI, managed by `INotifyPropertyChanged` and `ObservableCollection`.

In turn, the domain model no longer needs to be aware of any of the complexity of the view.  It no longer cares if the data is coming from a textbox, password box, drop-down list, etc.  It just interacts with the ViewModel in plain-old-C# and gets values from a simple property."
worldnews,ffcofsc,t1_ffbzuwq,1579803795.0,"> I think you have a misunderstanding of how businesses operate. You've already agreed that recycling isn't cost competitive. Businesses will gladly provide recycled goods at a higher cost to consumers, the issue is that for the most part, consumers simply don't value recycled goods. This isn't some conspiracy, it's plain ole economics.

And I'm simply saying that if you priced in the cost of disposal, whether it's recycling that actually happens or landfill or biodegradable, at the time of manufacture, then ""simple economics"" would make consumers prefer the easily recyclable or biodegradable packaging.

> Okay so Coca-Cola is paying $0.05 cents to dispose of my plastic bottle instead of me (even though I'm probably going to be paying $0.05 more per bottle).That doesn't solve the issue that recycling is not economically viable at this point in time.

*You don't have to solve that problem*.  You've funded the true cost of disposal (and it would be more than 0.05 for a plastic bottle) *or* proper recycling (which doesn't exist for plastic right now).  So if it's not economical to recycle, it won't be recycled, but it won't end up in a river, either.

> You just need the public to value creating less waste, which there's progress being made every day. If you want to get to your goal, you have to accept that you can't get there over night, it takes steady progress.

You could spend billions on ""awareness"" and it would shift behavior a bit.  As soon as you stopped your PR campaign, laziness would reassert itself and people would slip back to old behaviors.  The easiest, most effective way to get the public to ""value creating less waste"" is to simply put a proper monetary value on the waste at the time of purchase.  That way, there is no disconnect between the waste decision at purchase time and the cost of disposal later."

That's the false dilemma. That's what producers want us to believe, because it is the business model they know and keeps their products cheap.

I'm saying that if you priced in the cost of disposal/true recycling into the product at time of manufacture, the free market *would* respond and producers would be forced to switch to more sustainable materials and packaging.
> but where I live (USA) you have to pay someone to come pick up your garbage and dispose of it

Because the price is *being ignored*.  Rather, recycling has a cost associated with it, but throwing something away does not (or is flat rate), and neither is paid by the manufacturer/wholesaler/retailer.
