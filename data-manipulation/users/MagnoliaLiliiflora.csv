Sims4,ffuae99,t1_fftlr7c,1580237829.0,"Same with my husband! He is so sweet and he occassionally just asks how my sims are doing hahaha in return I pretend to care when he's talking about call of duty and try to remember to ask him how he's been enjoying it when he hasn't mentioned it in a while. That's true love though! You have to be able to let your partner share what they love with you, even if what they love is kind of boring! Hahaha"
aww,ffj1uzk,t3_etsgzl,1579988287.0,She is too cute! Happy year of the rat!
plants,ff7a4v6,t3_erwc9d,1579644355.0,Something like these would also be nice test tube holders for water test kits Aquarium enthusiasts use.
aww,fehpgk0,t1_fehdkqs,1579121255.0,This! Cats are perpetually 14 and dogs are perpetually 4.
aww,fehoyz1,t1_fegy8eg,1579120974.0,"Whenever I leave for more than 5 minutes I enter my house to both of my cats waiting by the door, just behind the dog. They don't bark and jump around like idiots but they follow me around meowing until I give them each a hug. Some cats arent all that complicated."
LifeProTips,feayeon,t1_feaxsw2,1578953518.0,That is a worth while point to continue making! There are a decent amount of people out there who still don't realize just how little privacy they actually have online.
LifeProTips,feaxhtp,t1_feavu7f,1578953223.0,"I'm sure reddit knows or would know if they needed to know my identity. I never implied that reddit itself wouldn't know who their users are, what I meant was that its users, for the most part, do not publically tie their real life identities to their reddit profiles. On Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter the intent is that the user's  public profile is tied to their real life identity. On reddit the intent is that the user's public profile is only tied to their real life identity if the user chooses to do so."
LifeProTips,feasrj4,t1_feaq036,1578951893.0,"Technically yes. But, I think op meant forms of social media in which your actual identity is attached."
mildlyinteresting,feaog7j,t1_feao5z7,1578950839.0,I'm in the US. I think my gal pals and I could make it a thing!
mildlyinteresting,feannxm,t1_feal87f,1578950632.0,"I've only heard the term one other time on an Australian show.... is the term more commonly used outside of the US? I generally just hear heart or anatomical heart to clarify what type of heart a person has drawn. Or is it a new term that's getting popular? ""Love heart"" is kind of cute sounding."
mildlyinteresting,feaixu2,t1_feahhl5,1578949432.0,"Ok, so this is the second time in a week I've heard the term ""love heart"".... what is a love heart? Isn't it just a heart shape? Why call it a love heart? Is it a cultural thing? I'm genuinely just curious. Hope I don't come off as rude for asking...."
blackcats,fbzw4wd,t3_efbyxe,1577264812.0,Your tree is still standing and has ornaments?! Looks like one cute little floof has been sleeping on the job! I'm jealous. I gave up on fighting for the right to a christmas tree this year.
