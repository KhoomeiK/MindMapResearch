todayilearned,fe7apnz,t1_fe5ycq7,1578912158.0,"Yeah, that sucks. You’ll get there though! Take your time, and don’t forget you’ve just had a bit of you chopped out, because that takes time to recover from. I pushed myself to much once the initial pain had passed, but there’s still a lot of healing to do so take it steady."
