I've recently finished the version by Seneca. I'd known about the golden fleece and all, but the story put into a tragedy was influential. It made me wonder about the psychological tendencies which result from anger and love. I'd say there are Jason, Medea, the poet and another important figure in the poem.

The speakers here can be Jason and Medea or the poet and a loved one or Jason/the poet and Medea/loved one; all sharing common interests, emotions and experiences (the poet didn't give such a reason in reality though). The poem arose from the question, ""What in the story am I really affected by?"" Jason knows he's feeling guilt for his doings and is scared of Medea's wrath, yet at the same time he knows he is not the killer of his children. He is scared, because he admires the limitlessness of Medea's love; he is also relieved, because there is another one who has done much worse than him, and maybe he thinks that the whole thing was his fate (first being rewarded with such a great love, then everything turning upside down), which is a relief.

On the other side, Medea is in love with Jason and pursues her love until the very end when she's left with nothing but the despise of Gods. So, I believe she's already punished and we don't need to find anybody to accuse of the things they did.

In the end, I think this whole thing is not to be judged but it should be watched to ask questions. I don't really have any clear judgement or try to induce the reader, other than the things you would read above. And the main question I'm seeking an answer to is: was she able to achieve what she wanted?

poetry_critics,feg8cri,t3_eox2aw,1579081888.0,"I always try to be careful when approaching love poems. I'll try my best.

Very pleasant and good at capturing the special moments you share with someone important to you. The mirror effect used in the poem is also unexpectedly beautiful (surprised me in the second block). In the second part also is that different language which makes it easier for me to understand there are two separate people.

As a general thing, it might also be a good idea to use sound of words overall to picture the differences and get it moving. Imagery is pretty good. (That breath of poem part in particular.) 

So, I think you could use some play with sounds. Thanks for sharing."

AskMenOver30,fe5wd5h,t3_entnld,1578876422.0,"I'm 26, (maybe it's impolite to comment on this but kind of feeling I could contribute) don't consider myself successful all the time, but when people in my family see my brother, I'm successful.

If I'm to compare myself to others around me, I feel bad because of the lack of success, but if I compare myself with my brother I feel relieved. Then, some sort of shame because he's my brother. Yet, he doesn't treat me well as if he doesn't want me to earn it (sounds like your fear of losing all the things you have), so I think, ""I'm not the one to feel bad. I work hard and you don't."" 

Some characters in life take the reality as it is, they don't have any grudges for others' success. They're laid back, OK with the bad decisions they've made, ready to undertake some more or make some improvements. They already compliment and respect for what you have done. Some characters like to not see their deficiencies. It's not only not seeing, but also an effort to draw the attention to more minor things. In other words, they are always focused on other people's achievements, which makes them feel petty (another reality is that we are all going to die, therefore we are petty and weak). 

I don't exactly know about your situation, it sounds like it's happening only on your side. But your time is and was definitely precious. You might have been lucky, but that's life. You can help others if you like, but there some others who cannot be helped as well (I like the analogy of saving somebody who's drowning in sea on this).

We should show love to ourselves first."
poetry_critics,fe507ao,t3_enow1k,1578864467.0,"That's a beautiful insight here. Personally I like imagery a lot, and sometimes think I should use it less. Inspirational.

I like how it resolves at the end. That's how we feel when we finally find some time to understand ourselves and shadowy parts of our brains open to us."

I totally agree with you. And I do that from time to time. As we grow in population and develop more technology like social platforms, it seems we have more information as to what other people do. If this flooding input is not controlled we also kind of lose touch with our minds and thus goals. 

When that happens I immediately take control over what I do: delete apps on my phone, rearrange my habits. I also see a minority of people do that. As it's minority we don't notice, but in reality there are people who feel like us and try to find a solid way to improve on something specific. And they're on track and they can achieve their goals.

So you can do it too."

I don't live in the States, so I can't try it myself but it looks like-minded people started some organization and that's enough to help me. 

My father's been drinking like a horse since he was 16 or sth. Even bypass didn't stop him from drinking. When I got to university I had to move into his apartment and enjoyed it quite a while after all those years looking for a father figure. Then I slowly began thinking it had been mindless of him. And recently I've met and chat with some people with the same experiences. And there you go... It all makes sense all of a sudden. Now I can even tell why I've always been attracted to broken people.

To those who feel shame of some sort, those who are desperately looking for esteem and those who would undermine themselves without noticing.

I've also met people who's had the same experience which relieved me a little, but never realized that it was a common trauma which would shackle minds up.

I even remember telling a psychiatrist about my background, but she didn't address the situation as you did at ""child being the parent of his parents"""
