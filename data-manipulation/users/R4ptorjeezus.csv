BreakUps,ff23ut4,t3_er6y1m,1579493074.0,"Something I read on Reddit quite recently, that helped me, is that your body is going through oxytocin withdrawal. The emotions you’re feeling are going to be amplified, and your brain is going to try and obsess and reason etc to get that fix of love chemicals, even though you know logically that you can’t get that. It’ll ease off with time.
Another realisation I had - your ex partner’s opinion of you and the relationship is their business, and doesn’t diminish your intrinsic value or worth, or define you as a person. I’m sorry you’re hurting right now."

Don’t give up on yourself. I’m sure we will both remember who we are, and what we do well out in the world, soon enough, and have the strength to return to normal. I hope you’re ok"
offmychest,ff1vq33,t3_eqxx45,1579487251.0,So happy for you both ❤️
UnsentLetters,fc7cggp,t3_egl1ls,1577503381.0,I am so sorry for all of that.
