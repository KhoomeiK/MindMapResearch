No, the terrorists who blow shit up, rape women, stone gays, etc. Haha, you don't have the balls to say it when evil stares right in your face. You ""atheists"" do not realize how spineless, zealous and unskeptical you are. New atheism really is the easiest mass of people to control. I bet my friend you would say this btw, that's why I'm having this reaction. I'll leave you this.

ConsumeProduct,ffsexc0,t3_eup4nb,1580180047.0,"I’m more scientific than these “atheists”. They just ram against Christian religions because it’s the most peaceful one and they don’t have the balls to bash Islam. More importantly, they’re religious fundamentalists and they fail to grasp and by nature of the infinite universe, we all have beliefs to help us justify our finite lives. They also replace spiritual lives with material lives and claim that it’s better as we can see here.  Ironically, those living material life’s often accomplish much less because their driven by their base desires only which are quick to change and easy to satisfy. These people are losers. There’s a 90 year old who built his own cathedral by himself in Spain. That’s what happens when you have beliefs beyond getting an instant high like these sad, pathetic losers."

ImGoingToHellForThis,ffhhba9,t1_ffhaeq9,1579935228.0,"Not at all dude, not at all. People on 4chan have conviction. There’s no upvotes and you just care about your arguments getting heard or getting info while being able to discern yourself. Redditors are the lowest drugs of humanity, they have no motivation, self-awareness and you could calculate their opinions just by seeing what posts get the highest upvotes. They are a particles in a wave with no will of their own which makes them the antithesis to “moral people” as moral people have a code regardless of the circumstances. The world would be better of without redditors."
SuicideWatch,fffq8r8,t1_fffh096,1579889442.0,"You do realize the whole point of Christianity and religion is because it realizes man errs towards sin and that it's not good for him to do so. You corrected your mistakes, and now you have to repent for them by not doing it again and living a commendable life. Thinking about regret constantly is just another form of wasting time, the best thing you can in accordance with your beliefs - is to face whatever the consequences from your addiction are head-on and deal with them. Help others. Read the Bible if you are so worried. And read it thoroughly. Or go to confessions. I have not admittedly."

The meme is that despite being 13% of the population, people of that population commit over 50% of the crime. Meaning they’re hugely over represented. It doesn’t mean that all 13% commit crime, saying that’s what people mean is disingenuous. I don’t even think you’re aware of what you are saying."
