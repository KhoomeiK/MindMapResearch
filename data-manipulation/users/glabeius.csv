For example, 8s commonly learned 8ness from their father or another authority figure. 

7s report having a strong gather figure that was too strong to avoid, and embrace femininity and charm instead

Without a doubt, nature and nurture affect enneagram type. Considering that the 9 types are part of collective unconciousessnes passing down to us, there's no way we didn't learn it one way or another."

RealTesla,ffnfkgv,t1_ffn2ovk,1580065329.0,"Well no, there's a pretty big misunderstanding that Marx would be considered big government.. In fact there are lots of misunderstandings of Marx. For example, he highlighted the opening of labor force to women and children as destroying the family unit and bad for society which is pretty contrary to contemporary liberal opinions. This is similar to thinking he was egalitarian which is also a pretty big misunderstanding.

In terms of looking at things like democratizing work places there are some interesting examples in Spain and Italy. The ideology is usually called anarcho-syndicalism or syndicalism which essentially creating better worker rights through strong trade unionism.

The issue with Marx is that he was in general mostly theoretical philosopher, philosiphizing the advancement of capitalism to eliminate class distinctions (before it was serf lord king, which changed to laborer, bourgeois, and capitalist class) due to the end of scarcity. The only issue is Marx didn't really predict the size and ability for consumer culture to capture everything. (Which is why certain post modern ideas became popular philosophically in one)

This is why the pejorative of communism as some centrally planned economy don't really make sense, because communism is an utopian idea of post scarcity (you can download a car or whatever literally get any physical good you might ever want)

Star trek is a good example of communism"
RealTesla,ffmzj7p,t1_ffmjjnn,1580060482.0,"Well you're arguing from the perspective within a capitalistic economic system, so in that sense you are correct.

In our current society, getting rich, to an extent, allows upward mobility of class if you can raise yourself to a capitalist, rather than laborer (be the one who owns the hospital rather than the doctor) even though a doctor may get to rich, he didn't significantly raise class other than be at the top of working class.

The reason that Marx is against egalitarianism, is because it is a worthless concept. If you make people equal in one way (equal pay) you make them inequal another way (one produces more than the other) if you make them equal for how much they produce, then one works longer.

Forcing or making equality a goal just simply isn't helpful or realistic. Humans are inequal, some are relatively strong, weak, dumb, smart, intellectual, hands work, leader, follower. Etc. Etc.

What Marx would possibly consider a way to remove class distinctions, would be for example a restaurant that is collectively owned and profit is redistributed to the workers based on labor and output, not based on who was the financial owner of the store. And this isn't even really close to a proper socialist financial system, just first steps.

This would require some financial restructurings in a sense and isn't something that would happen overnight, but transitionally. Marx was always of the opinion that capitalism was a great advance past mercantalism and feudalism, and that socialism would be the advancing stages of capitalism. This is a historical materialist style of analysis. Essentially historical materialism is the idea that class distinctions, revolutions, social changes, occur due to the material needs lack or desire in society (this is simplistic, but a rough understanding of contextually what this means)"
RealTesla,ffmiezn,t1_ffl5ts8,1580055164.0,"Well when he speaks of class distinctions, he means in an economic sense of one who can raise capital or own means of production of their work vs selling labor.

Doesn't mean abolition of differences of humans"

It's weird how ethnostate and anti mixing supporting people tend to intermingle themselves. 

The hypocrisy makes it confusing

It's like men talking about how they want a traditional woman to raise their kids but will only go on a date with a woman with $500 makeup on and some fancy dress and bag w/ heels"
RealTesla,ffijlr7,t1_ffi6i7i,1579975424.0,"Kind of, but his reasoning is capitalist in nature.

By the way, Marx is anti-egalitarian. The whole leftists egalitarian thing is a SJW liberal concept"

RealTesla,ffg3ctd,t1_ffg26xc,1579897572.0,"Eh, we can chalk this down to semantics. Left is used for many different reasons but I personally think it's better to differentiate, politically, left vs liberal as they are extremely different. Is Yang to the ""left"" of Republicans? Maybe a little? The only person that really even delves into being more ""left"" is Bernie Sanders or green party. 

My problem with calling things leftist is that they lump liberal into that category, when economically Democrat liberals have pretty much been in the same page as Republicans, just with a weird crusade of social justice that marxists cringe at."
RealTesla,ffg1rmn,t1_ffg1h0x,1579896590.0,"No, that's not at all what I'm saying.

I'm saying there's almost nothing in his solutions or plans that are leftist in nature. They are closer to libertarian, centrist, and liberal, market solutions etc. He is a mixed bag and I'll stand corrected that he isn't really a true right wing libertarian, but he holds similar values and that's why his support comes from there.

If you could pinpoint anything Marxist or left about his policies I would love to see it. But if you dig deep into Yang he tries to get support from left leaning people with clever wording despite not actually supporting anything left leaning"
