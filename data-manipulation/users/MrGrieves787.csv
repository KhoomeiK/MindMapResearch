Advice,fd67vr0,t1_fd657w1,1578186832.0,"You can't honestly be surprised that you ranting in a one-sided fashion about communism didn't result in a date. Why even bring that up? Almost 0 countries practice communism (I can think of maybe 3); it's not really relevant at all. It reads as, ""I'm a right winger who has obsessive thoughts.""  From the way you describe it, I wouldn't have wanted to chat with you either. I'm guessing the other guy she was talking to talked about a movie he saw recently, her interests, something fun he did over the weekend or a new TV show. He may have waited for her to initiate a conversation, and chose to moderate his responses in a way that was appealing to her.

I'm starting to think you're not ugly at all; more that you're just not a good listener and your conversational style is aggressive and obsessive. Even in this conversation, you seem more interested in preaching than listening.

Are you able to work on this at all? What have you done to try to improve your social skills? Have you considered running these experiences by a professional counselor who can point out where you need to make adjustments? 

I think you're probably a decent looking young man who could have turned out differently, had the dark corners of the internet never got to you.

And if you need a definition of ""hyperbole,"" look no further than ""I know lots of 10 out of 10 women who all told me they had sex with 40 men."" Even if it was true (it isn't), you should know that no one is going to believe that besides other incels."
Advice,fd62b5j,t1_fd5zo4i,1578184574.0,"Reading this, I'm gonna say you've spent way, way too much time online. You exaggerate and hyperbolize, feel sorry for yourself, and make up situations that fit what you already believe. 

I do feel for you; it's clear life has not always been kind to you, and I wish your circumstances had been easier. It sounds like your friends haven't been helpful. I know that social anxiety makes it worse.

But king, you're certainly not as ugly as you think you are. You're too young to give up. Uglier men than you get married, have families and live happy lives. However, if you continue with your beliefs that women are inherently shallow, life is all about the way you look, and that you are a victim in all of this, you will never get better and you will not be attractive to anyone.

I'm sorry if I was mean to you earlier. If you need some support, you can dm me."
Advice,fd5v0qp,t1_fd5uqm4,1578181842.0,"Yeah man I can picture you meeting 10 after 10 after 10 while they all immediately disclose their sexual history (40 guys each).

You read all this shit online. I get that you're depressed and dating hasn't worked out for you, but this is all incel mythology that belongs in the garbage.
