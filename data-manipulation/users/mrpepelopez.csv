The same state has Yosemite and Joshua Tree National Parks (plus 7 others) You could drive through the monotonous central valley or mojave desert areas for hours and feel kind of like you were in Texas but only a couple of hours away is every other kind of climate (well except tropical). 

The highest elevation  in the contiguous US (Mt. Whitney 4,421 m) and the lowest one (Death Valley - 86m) are only about 175km from each other. There are people skiing in the mountains at the same time people are surfing on the coasts. 

Helps that California is coastal and mostly longer than it is wide so with all the the different elevations and microclimates it's a very diverse area."

Plenty of people born in the 70s had parents born in the late 40s or 50s meaning they were X and their parents were boomers. But boomers also started the trend of waiting longer to have kids. My mom's similar aged siblings had kids in their 30s instead of 20s so my cousins are millenials."

There's already a smart and final down the road and I don't think a foods co or something like that would do any better.

 I only brought up winco because it's one of those cheaper stores that seems to appeal to people across different income brackets kind of like grocery outlet so you could draw customers both from the long term working class residents of Oak Park as well as the newer higher income people."
PraiseTheCameraMan,fdw8y6n,t1_fdw2ozb,1578756278.0,"I would think it's pretty common for TV nowadays. For film it may not be as necessary because you only are shooting for a set amount of time and then the whole thing is done so you might as well just shoot on location for authenticity although a lot of times Toronto or Vancouver or whatever substitutes for the city it's supposed to be. 

If a TV show is on for years it doesn't really make sense to have to do all the work of having the cast and crew go to NY or wherever just to get the occasional outdoor scene. Back in the days before CGI they would just do shoot a bunch of stuff outdoors in whatever city it was supposed to be one time and then use snippets of that for establishing shots for the whole series. So Friends or Seinfeld or whatever would just show some generic image of a NY neighborhood and then cut to the actors on a stage in LA pretending they are in NY."
