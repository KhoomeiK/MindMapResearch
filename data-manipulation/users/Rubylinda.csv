KetoWorld,ffib9n1,t1_ffgjbjf,1579969755.0,I tried the recipe. Made 4 normal size cupcakes. Baked them almost 15 minutes as they were still quite mushy at 12. Turned out yummy and moist. Almost like a lava cake. Both hubby and I enjoyed them.

RBI,ff9lm6f,t3_ese425,1579715578.0,Water control testing or some type of quality control testing. Freeze the packs then use in the container they sent to send the water or product back for testing. Had to do this for my previous job.

I have no problem with eating sugar (10 years out) but I just prefer to not use it unless a must. Using sugar just gets us back to eating unhealthy - which is part of why we're here in the first place."
KetoWorld,ff5ddaj,t1_ff4z2h3,1579588192.0,Well CRAP! Looking for something to satisfy my sweettooth that doesn't involve ingredients that I can't find in my small European town. I can find small pouches of almond/coconut flour (after taking out a small bank loan) but that's as exotic as it gets. Several recipes that I've tried are dense and boring.

Cooking,fekdhiz,t3_epl173,1579197757.0,Sorry for your loss. Hubby did the same thing to my stock once. But that pales in comparison to when I told him I broke the needle on the sewing machine and by the time I bought a new needle (2 weeks) he had thrown away the whole sewing machine.
