That’s actually how I found out I had synesthesia.  I was googling calendars to plan my year and they all looked the wrong way to me, because I was imagining it the reverse way in my head."

dankmemes,fegdcvr,t3_eoog7j,1579088658.0,I mean all memes aside this is stupid. no rapper has ever rhymed the n word with itself. You can’t rhyme the same word with itself or else you have weak ass bars. Honestly this tells me you probably have no clue how internal rhyme schemes work and just assume it’s simplistic because that’s the last word of each sentence.

We always got rid of them if they got donated because dogs just tear them up and eat the stuffing. Much, much more trouble than it’s worth and a safer bet is toys designed for dogs."

WayOfTheBern,fee3mj3,t1_fee1vy5,1579025705.0,Lmao he was famous literally almost twenty years ago for allowing the massacre and rape of Muslims when he was governor of gujarat. This year he and his party passed the citizenship law that’s causing mass protests because it disproportionately stops Muslims from gaining citizenship. He’s a Hindu nationalist and he has a record of hurting Muslims.
WayOfTheBern,fee2zjf,t1_fedz1co,1579025326.0,"I think she’s just too dishonest for me. She misrepresents stuff like other politicians and once I saw her exposed for it I realized she doesn’t hold the same values as me. There’s an hour long video by Nathan Robinson that solidified things a lot for me that you can watch, the one example that really stood out to me was about schooling. She was asked why she supports public schools when her children went to private schools, she got indignant and said “my kids went to public schools.” Well, turns out they did for part of the time but they spent a lot more time in private school. Instead of standing for her values and explaining them she tried to trick us. In the news the past few days a lot of people are disappointed with her handling of the tensions with sanders."

This part always gets me:
When I was 5, I told my mom I wanted to die
Then we cry, the crazy shit, man, it wasn’t a lie
Man, this life, is filled with stress
So much oppressed, call New York City ""9""
I sit alone and reflect, took me 28 years to realize that I'm blessed
Aunt Pam died from cancer; I quit them cigarettes
Weight of world on my shoulder—I just finished my reps"
thedavidpakmanshow,fecccvd,t1_fe6v23s,1578970636.0,"Bernie is winning the independent vote. According to one poll I saw he was the only candidate who had any support among independents, in the 20s while everyone else was hardly in double digits."
Synesthesia,fe72j9y,t3_enxn4h,1578909063.0,Yeah this is exactly how my synesthesia works. Like the other commenter said your personal connection to the song plays a huge role in the way your synesthesia responds. List your favorite songs and they probably have a synesthesic response. Or songs that strike you. A lot of songs give me no response at all but they’re the ones I also forget easily. At least that’s how mine works.
thedavidpakmanshow,fe6udqi,t1_fe6gosj,1578905417.0,"Bernie appeals to the class of people who are tired of being jerked around by the “establishment” that spans prey lines. His policies are very popular but more than that he has values that line up with many more Americans than joe Biden. People overwhelmingly want someone to change the way things are. Whether they can beat trump is hard to say in the primary but I don’t think joe Biden has a shot in hell. Bernie Sanders’ messaging appeals to many of the same people trump got in 2016, people who were completely uninterested in the establishment (bush, Cruz, Rubio). They both had anti war, anti corruption, pro-working class, anti-status quo planks in their campaigns except only one of them actually believes that stuff.  I think we’re in the process of realignment around those issues so regardless of the outcome of 2020, I expect this process is going to continue for a long time."

thedavidpakmanshow,fe68k7o,t1_fe61kvn,1578884142.0,I disagree completely. I don’t think joe Biden appeals to the country the way Bernie does. I think if we saw both options of the general election Bernie would gain traction and Biden would be humiliated way worse than Hillary

He thought for sure he could beat the mongols by just hiding out in his castles but he didn’t realize they had Chinese siege engineers since they had just conquered northern China. His empire fell immediately and left the entire Middle East open to the mongols who invaded and sacked Baghdad.

QuotesPorn,fddc2qf,t1_fdche7r,1578304972.0,It’s historically dubious to claim that the founding fathers were divided on the issue of white supremacy. They were all firmly white supremacist just like all of Europe. Obviously this was a lot more common back then but that doesn’t excuse anything.

RussiaLago,fczxgt3,t1_fcz3vrl,1578110296.0,It’s one thing to be skeptical of regime change and war in the Middle East but that’s just not true. They support terrorist organizations throughout the region that advance their interests including in Iraq. That’s headed by Quds.
