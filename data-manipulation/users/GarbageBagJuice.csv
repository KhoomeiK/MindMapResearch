When I ordered my head unit I accidentally got one that was only compatible with cars that came with that screen, and ended up changing my order. This headunit may not be directly compatible.  It may be just a difference in space available or some major compatibility issue.

If everything is working besides the speakers, you could just buy a wiring harness and wire it up by hand.  Seicane has a wiring diagram on their website.  Buy something like this:  https://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_70142_Axxess-AX-ADFD02.html

Then clip the incompatible plug from the stereo, and wire it up using the seicane and axxess diagrams.  You can even wire in your steering wheel controls with this, I believe.   This would replace the plug that comes from the seicane unit.

The plug that connects the speakers also is the CAN-BUS connection.  Did your head unit come with a CAN-BUS decoder/encoder?

Did you send them a picture of your stock head unit before they shipped it?  I'm pretty sure they have 2 different wire harnesses for different setups.  They should be able to send you the right one if it exists.

Which stereo setup did you have?  I believe there are 3 configurations, the one with no Bluetooth/Ford Sync at all(what I had), the basic Bluetooth/sync model, and the full spec one capable of navigation/backup cam setup(MyFordTouch?).   The first two are compatible with the same Android head units (but may need a different wiring harness), but in at least some cases, the MFT setups require a different head unit for whatever reason.

If everything else is working on the unit, you could get an after market wiring harness, and wire the plug from that to the wires coming from the headunit(seicane has a wiring diagram on their site).

If you can still return the unit, I'd recommend looking for a px3 or px5 based head unit instead.  I hate how this head unit is setup, and there isn't a way to hack the firmware on these, or even get root.  I've spent far too much time making this thing usable for Google maps and Google play music, and my backup camera still isn't triggering on it's own.

I worked at a dotcom company that gave 50% on 3%, or 100% on 6% in company stock.  Basically everyone took the 100% match and had nothing when the company stock crashed.

Seems like a way to pump your stock price at the expense of your employees financial security. A lot of people use their 401k as their emergency fund.  If your 401k is full of stock in the company you work for, it won't be a very good emergency fund.  Like all of those Enron employees that didn't get backpay or severance couldn't dip into their 401k's because almost everyone took advantage of the more generous matching if they bought Enron stock."

AskReddit,ff3510y,t1_ff2to2u,1579533837.0,"I think it's important to communicate your limits when the person is not in crisis, if possible.

Some depressed people(especially those with borderline personality disorder), may take statements like ""I need to set a limit of 15 minutes today"", the wrong way.  To someone who's in the wrong state of mind, this can be seen as a signal that you don't care, or that you don't understand the seriousness of their current crisis.

It's not ideal to declare these kinds of boundaries when the person is in the middle of a crisis.  Depression isn't a good frame of mind to have a rational discussion.   You don't want to let things get so bad that you snap at someone who's reaching out for support.  

Instead of picking a time limit, I would wait the 15 minutes (or however long you feel you can deal) and then say something like, ""I'm not in a good frame of mind to talk about this today, can we do this tomorrow?""

May also provide access to my research databases.

MA: Minuteman Library Network - https://library.minlib.net/selfreg
6 month membership that gets you access to the MA ebook system, Overdrive, and access to state research databases.  Other features likely, as the card will work at any library in the network.  Open to all MA residents.

You should ask the mechanic that told you the car was manipulated to hide the check engine light to be a witness if necessary.  If it was simply that the codes had been cleared before you took possession, he can claim he made a repair and needed to clear the codes.  If the mechanic can tell that the code was repeatedly cleared,  or that he somehow manipulated the system to try to hide a defect, then maybe you can prove that he intentionally concealed a defect.

If you've got good lemon laws in your state, you can get triple damages if you can prove he intentionally hid problems with the car.   Even without a lemon law, you probably have a small claims case, since it's essentially theft by deception.

Before you sue, you should read up on your lemon laws, and search the guys name for civil judgements through your courthouse(you can do this online in many states).

The other hurdle is that these shady fucks know how to work the lemon laws.  Usually you have to give them a certain number of repair attempts, and they'll jerk you around about them, do nothing, or try to delay.  Know the law, and when he's passed his limit to try and repair the vehicle.
