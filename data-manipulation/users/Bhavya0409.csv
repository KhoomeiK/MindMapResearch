CompetitiveTFT,ff706yd,t3_erzo56,1579638491.0,"Thanks for the tips! My highest was d1 but I'm hovering d2-d3 now :(. What do you do when you roll down to upgrade your board, and you think you're strong, but you lose the first round after pve? Do you roll down because you might still be weak or econ up?"
CompetitiveTFT,fe9frk1,t1_fe91czr,1578937174.0,"Go next. Not even joking. If you have bad econ and low health, you screwed up hard early game and now the rest of the lobby is stronger, better board, more health, higher level, etc.

If you want to try, then maybe try to roll down at 0 at level 7 and try to stabilize so you try to top 6, if not top 4. Cut your losses as much as you can, figure out how and why you got to that position, and try not to do it again.

This is d1 elo where you get punished for falling behind, so lower elo it should be easier to salvage."
CompetitiveTFT,fe3h56j,t1_fe2v5nv,1578849214.0,"You have to gauge the strength of the lobby. This takes practice you have to play a lot of games to determine power spikes of each comp, but once you know, then it's easy to say, ""doesn't look like i beat the majority of the lobby"". If you end up thinking that your weak, and will likely lose >10 health in a round, you should roll down.

Also keep an eye out for when most of the lobby levels. If you see 3 people get level 6, you should probably also level so you don't fall behind."

I know you run electric warden with tank items, but I tried running the comp yesterday and never got the zed and bottom 4.

CompetitiveTFT,fdhjyyv,t3_ekuitp,1578424254.0,"Biggest red flag I see is being sad that you have pairs. Pairs, unless they are necessary in your comp, are baits early game. I always prioritize econ over pairs early, since selling the pairs allows me start compounding interest, and also allows me earlier pick at stage 2 carousel. I usually tank until then, get 20-30g by carousel, then level to 5 afterwards, roll down if I need to to stay strong, and chill. This will allow you to get some 3 stars that you can use to build a mid game comp around, and since you have more items, you should have a good direction you want to go, which also solves the ""I don't know what comp I want to go"" problem you said you have.

One small thing that helped me is, if when trying to decide what comp you wanna go is, instead of just looking at your items, think of all your items + any item you think you can use. Like if you started with gloves, cloak and bf, that might not be an obvious answer, but if you think ""if I get a bow on car, I can make an ie and runaans, which are good items for rangers"" that not only helps you identify a comp, but will also help prioritize what units to keep/pairs to throw for econ early.

Hope this helps. Im D2 for reference (although hard stuck as well :( )"

Especially since the last time giant slayer got updated, it was buffed (albeit, only 1%). My issue lies with transitioning late game, mainly at level 8 around the 5 cost units.

CompetitiveTFT,fd3y0gr,t1_fd3op9g,1578162611.0,"You ask a lot of good questions, so I'll try to be as detailed as I can. But keep in mind, I'm the one asking for help so I'm definitely doing something wrong here haha.

I used to econ hard like with most other comps, but I find that since rangers are not that strong late game, I've had more success leveling early. Also, you have to play aggressive in high diamond lobbies to keep up so that's another reason. Every game is situational, but I tend to level to 5 after carousel, 6 after krugs, and 7 around stage 3 carousel. You want to avoid rolling down until you hit 7 since you need ashe/twitch to figure out if you wanna do a poison or crystal variation. In my experience, leveling is more important than econing since if you have decent items and a decent frontline, you can stay top of the lobby for the majority of the game. That might not be the right play, but it was worked for me.

I think its important to talk about itemization here since it concerns a lot of other stuff, so I'll discuss it now. Bows are super important on rangers (duh), but what really helps me stay stable throughout the game is early runaanns + X on 2* vayne. X can be anything, like IE, GS, Statik, Hush, Red (although you wanna save belt for morellos). Vayne with runaans melts since silver bolts procs on multiple targets. It's so good that I usually don't sell her until I get my Ashe or Twitch 2* since she constantly tops dmg every round. She's the reason I stay healthy until mid/late game. Other than that, obviously bow and ranger items are good, but if you end up getting rod or belt, make sure you prioritize getting morellos since you can put that on malphite, amumu, or singed late game.

In general I like to have 4 rangers and 2 wardens, or 2 rangers and 4 wardens plus something else. This is usually like an annie for inferno, or yorick in case i have nasus and vayne still up for light, but any extra unit that is good can be put in. The comp you mentioned leaned toward shadow rangers, which is really strong, but it's not usually the build I target (although I probably should).

As for twitch vs ashe, I'm partial to ashe since the crystal buff is really strong. Also, if you itemized well, then ashe should output tons of dps, like 9-10k a fight, with the next most being like 1k. The only reason I don't like twitch is because hes really squishy, but that might just be poor positioning on my part since he gets blown up a lot. (One note: if you get the ashe but not the taric, make sure you try to get a skarner cor crystal since that's super important).

I hope that answered a lot of your questions. On the flip side, if there is anything wrong with what I said, feel free to tell me since there must be something I'm doing wrong and want to improve. Although, this setup has usually netted me consistent top4's at d3-d2 so climbing this way up until here should work. Also tftteacher put out a ranger guide today so take a look at that as well. It seems mostly in line with what I said."
CompetitiveTFT,fd3em99,t1_fd1tvi4,1578157608.0,"I know blender and zerkers really well, I've just been trying rangers out. Maybe I'll go back to zerkers since they're strong again. I also know transitions well, I'm usually top3 until level 7 or even 8. But I think your right, it's hard to fit in mystic which is why I get decked late game.

To add to that, I also know itemization well. I get pretty good ranger items every game, as well as a morello for either malphite, amumu, or singed late game. There was a game where I started with two tears and a cloak, and played ocean mage wardens and got third. I'm by no means any good, but I have a solid handle on comps. Just trying rangers cause the units are uncontested for the most part"

Although thinking ""RNG is bad, lemme play for top4,"" might help you top4, even that might not work at all because your carry units are contested and getting to even top4 will be hard. Ideally, you'd want to think of a good pivot given what you have. The best way that I've done that is before rolling down (at stage 3, when people usually roll at level 6), think of 4 cost units that you can pick up that you can transition with. If you don't get ur carry unit, u can pivot using that 4 cost. For example, I wanted to go berserker one game and started with 4 wardens. Rolling down, I didn't find any olafs, but I found 2 malphites, so I transitioned into electric wardens and got 2nd (woulda got first but I pooped the bed)

One more thing, and this may not matter much for lower elos, but I found that when I hit diamond, the lobby is much more aggressive and have a stronger current board state at all points of the game beats having 5 econ. If you have a weaker board, that will compound over time; you'll lose a lot more health and you won't get the units you need. At times, it's worth it to roll from 40g to make sure you don't bleed in order to stabilize instead of greeding for that 1-2 more econ"
