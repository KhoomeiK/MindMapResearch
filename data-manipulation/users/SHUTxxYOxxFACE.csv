quit yer bullshit you're barely out of high school. you have no idea what anything before this *millennium* was like that you didn't see on TV or hear about in music. In the good old day's, the country was prosperous because of socialist programs like the interstate highway program and the new deal and montgomery GI bill. Capitalism worked alongside liberal ideals like progressive taxation, where the richest paid their fair share and helped rebuild the country. All your favorite institutions, like the military and public police and schools.. they're all based on socialist principals. You're parroting what you're told about the good old days, not knowing what going back would mean to civil rights, to general welfare, to public safety minded regulations. Do you wanna go back to when we had no problem calling someone a fag or n\*\*r? back when we had separate drinking fountains? or back when we had no EPA to regulate corporations that dump toxins in rivers?

How about open up to what your future can be if you strive to make it better for all people, rather than wishing to be in a time and place that will allow you to say dumb shit out loud without having anyone call you on your bullshit.

you may be more successful asking in the general nms sub. most people here are traveling toward the hub which is approx 700000u from the center.

Ringo took the picture. Ringo had the picture. Kids tell everyone that Ringo took their picture but no one believes them. Ringo publishes a book of photographs. Much older kids see the picture.

If custom waypoints are still bugged on xb, visit omutsiju xvii by portal (there's a portal next to my base at Estelles Solanium Thicket) complete a mission from the vendor at the space station but don't turn it in, portal back then if that mission is still active in your log, when you go into the galactic map you can select ""active mission"" and it will highlight the route right back to the desired system :)"

hey side question? do you still have your olverha colony base? visited recently? since I got mine back after it was featured, only one other base appears on the entire island now. of all the originals, they're all gone. I'm worried the 2000u buffer around featured bases to protect them.. wiped out the entire colony :( or that they just won't display for me, but they still exist? I dunno"

NMSGalacticHub,fe31ash,t1_fdy6qr5,1578844960.0,"(for XB) next time... visit your desired system via portal, as long as there is a space station you can complete a mission from the vendor at the destination system but don't turn it in there, portal back and if that mission is active in your log, when you go into your galactic map and select ""active mission"" it will act the same as a custom waypoint :)

for those on Pc/PS4, just visit your desired system via portal, portal back then through your discoveries tab you can create a custom waypoint to a system you've visited. With the waypoint set, you will see a route highlighted when you select ""custom waypoint"" from the route selector.

In either case, make sure to use the guide lines as just a guide. Free your camera and point yourself in the general direction those lines lead, then just zoom out until you hit your jump limit. Many people complain about having a 2k+ warp drive but only can get 500ly on their jumps.. because they're actually following the guide lines which take you well off path and end at a fraction of your jump limit.

anyway ya'll safe travels!  and welcome!"

Do your research, the cost you would pay into universal healthcare with taxes, would be far less than you pay into private insurance with premiums subtracted from your wages. You would have more money. Period.

Why are you resistant to a tax for something you can actually use. If you pay taxes you're paying for school districts whether you have kids or not. Fire departments whether your house is on fire or not. Because they're there when you need them. Just like hospitals. 

I don't want to forcefully tax persons that don't give a shit about others, I want to set them adrift on an iceberg because if you live in a fucking society you can't be anti social and expect to not be called a shitbag for it. Grow up."
