explainlikeimfive,ffgnevv,t1_ffgj9r9,1579910300.0,"""Drink"" is a humourous exaggeration, I concede, but I maintain what I said. As for sources, most of what I describe is easily found in the first page of Google as it's hardly an obscure practice. Personally, it's something I studied when in university, and then talked about with my sister, a GP (it's the kind of thing that sticks with you).

I can't speak for every medical professional - and considering so many drugs have multiple routes of administration I'm not surprised that other methods are used - but in the cases I covered and the occasions my sister either performed or observed the procedure, the slurry was administered through an NG tube. You comment about the acidic nature of the gut, but you forget that not only are these bacteria specialised to live in these conditions but it is also exactly where they are needed; C. Diff is very hardy, and its spores are a nightmare to remove, and colonising the stomach biota is vital. Additionally, administering through the colon seems somewhat insufficient, as it lacks the ""coverage"" throughout the gut for lack of a better word, as the alternative. Plus, an enema bag is designed to flush stuff *out*, not push it in.

Lastly, I very, very much would like to discourage you and anyone else from trying to perform a faecal transplant at home. Like, seriously, don't do that. Leave penetrating yourself with tubes to the professionals.

Edit: I forgot to write that on the contrary, the whole purpose of the treatment is that your stomach *does* need those bacteria, hence the procedure."

However, it is extremely antibiotic resistant, so when people are put on powerful antibiotics (generally the type found in hospitals rather than general usage), it can find itself the sole survivor. Before the regular balance can be restored it then grows out of control, causing severe acute issues that can prove fatal.

It can also be considered amongst the most disgusting, as it is often treated by orally-administered faecal transplant in order to re-colonise the GI tract with a stable gut flora."
