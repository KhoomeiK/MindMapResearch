politics,fegjrn2,t1_feghpmg,1579094896.0,"I mean ""believe women"" means to not immediately dismiss their accusations and to examine and investigate them instead. 

I am a Bernie supporter but I didn't immediately dismiss her accusations, I listened to their arguments and determined that, based on the fact that they were the only two present for the conversation (making this a he said she said by nature) and that Bernie has been openly in favor of female candidates, and on the record in 1988 saying ""a woman could become president"", and tried to get Warren herself to run in 2016, that him trying to put women down and say something derogatory is completely out of character. In addition, Warren has been very soft on this, fence sitting and simply making implications and she doesn't come off believable at all. It also makes sense for her to attempt to smear her ""closest"" political rival as she's sinking in the polls and he's rising. 

Whereas with Kavenaugh, literally all evidence points to the fact that your side supports an alcoholic, sexual predator, and dismissed all testimony to the contrary immediately, citing imagined political motivations. ""Boofing"" is a drinking game?  Clearly bullshit."

pcgaming,fdqci94,t3_emkzif,1578662961.0,"Was in the same boat as you a couple months ago and I have almost fully transitioned to keyboard to where I could beat ""controller me"" in 95% of situations now.

I would recommend using a mouse with 2 side buttons on the left (for a righty) where you can bind lethal and tactical grenades (side note: if you use c4, double tap F to blow it up. For some reason double tapping the lethal button is really laggy in this game.) I would recommend leaving *most* keybinds the default because COD uses pretty industry standard FPS keybinds so if you get used to that you'll have to adjust less when you play other games. One that I would recommend changing is using double tap to mount so that you don't require a key to mount your weapon. 

As others have said, keep your sensitivity low and I'd recommend a DPI of around 800-1000 on your mouse. You'll want a DPI around that level so that using other applications (if you ever start to game on PC) won't require switching to a usable DPI outside of the game.

You can play practice matches vs bots in private lobbies to get better with aim and movement and I like to use a gun like the Mk2 when I do that because, with the highest difficulty bots, or second highest, it's either hit a headshot or die basically. This will teach you to be accurate (but not how to track, that's a separate skill which you can use an AR for.) 

For movement, just practice. You do miss some finesse when moving away from analogue sticks to a keyboard and your mouse will play a larger role in your movement because of that, making small adjustments possible. This was the hardest part for me, and I almost gave up on it honestly, but stick with it. Once you get over the hump it's not so bad. I blindly hit the M key the other day for my map in Control and was pretty happy with myself :)"
