I feel like getting upset about a stereotype is just, but putting words in someones mouth so you can disagree with them isnt. It discredits an otherwise legitimate comment despite the fact that the spirit of it is true.

His post read very much from the perspective of someone who was raised to believe that it is a man's duty to provide and protect as their duty over taking care of themselves. As a man i know that that is a common and harmful belief. Some would argue there is a biological compulsion to support this as well as a social one, i haven't looked into that so i wont argue one way or another.

I do know that it is an expectation i have seen pressed more on men (again, I have seen, maybe I'm getting an inaccurate picture)

Nothing he says implies women dont feel, or that they aren't as altruistic, or as smart. There are certainly men who do think that, but bringing that up anytime someone speaks about their experience with their own sex is counter productive. 

As much as we would like men and women to be identical, they aren't. There is no superior sex, but that doesnt mean dome things dont apply more to one segment of the population. 

 He simply is speaking to his values (altruism, service, protection) which are ones society expects from men.


For example. If you were to talk about the expectation your family outs on you to have and raise kids, no one would say ""women just assume men cant care for children or provide good parenting"" because the societal expectation to want a family is pressed harder on women, even though obviously many parents still bother their sons about grandkids or whatever."

dropRogue

Sci-fi roguelike about an indentured servant mercenary that pays of their debt by using a halo/warhammer drop pod to slam into alien/rebel complexes/caves/forests/ruins completing a set of semi-random objectives, and extract again.

The base ship you extract to will be where you purchase items (perhaps level up as well, im not sure if that will be in game).

Depending on the mission or mode, there may be no extraction and you may just fight your way as deep into a complex as you can in a more traditional roguelike manner.

Not sure how much I want to play up the indentured servant part. Original concept was to nickel and dime for damages to property, rounds fired (restocked) and with various bonuses. Not sure if that would lead to unfun gameplay when traditionally fun things (explosions!) Are punished.

Also since your goal is pay off your debt, money spent on gear means you have to survive more missions to win, while the missions are always getting harder. This incentivize's you to make the most of the gear found in environments you are dropped in, despite the fact that some of the better gear in the game can be purchased outright."
