But please get her another kitty as a friend, this would make her double happy!"
AskReddit,ffrpqjb,t1_ffbnc5g,1580163089.0,"wow... I am sorry to hear that. I admit I came here because of your post in the writing subreddit, which made me so sad, but this now, -as a german- makes me even more sad... You arrived savely at home again, right? Did you get any compensations or something for your expenses and time spent here?"
occult,ffr3jxn,t3_eujhpi,1580149685.0,"Hi! I am just a lurker here. But with your sculptures,... I must say, they're amazing. You do an incredible job and I hope you're doing this professionally and you make a lot of money with it.

&#x200B;

As you already know how amazing your sculptures are, I don't need to tell you this again.

So I'd rather say something that's missing here for me.

The female attributes here. Of course, the snake coil is both male and female (in my interpretation), female Goats can have horns, and being stripped down to just muscle tissue, the body is more gender neutral, which really matches the ""original concept""  in my opinion of being ""just both yet none of them"". But I think a little more natural and a more definite male and female attribution on the figure would make it even better. But that's just my opinion. I am a huge fan of ""Baphomet"" or ""Tsophia""- both in art and concepts/interpretations, and I love how people interpret this concept fresh and new!

Please don't bite me here, I did not wish to insult you or anyone else here in any way.

One question however: HOW DO YOU MAKE THESE SCULPTURES?! :O"

Yet... this kitty might be in danger, which is very concerning to me. I'd rather have like 100 cute pictures less than 1 hurt kitty!"
