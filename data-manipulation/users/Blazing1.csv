MusicInTheMaking,ff6sbn3,t1_ff6buln,1579633856.0,This subreddit has been taken over by self promoters
MusicInTheMaking,ff6s9lx,t3_ervka0,1579633822.0,"This sub used to be about nothing but collabs, but now self promoters are ruining it."
AmItheAsshole,ff50lyd,t3_eri7oc,1579577033.0,"NTA. If you can't bear the thought of crashing or hearing about it, then dont fly. Your anxiety doesn't control other people."
AmItheAsshole,ff50f4i,t1_ff4vacl,1579576891.0,"If you can't take the anxiety of flying, don't fly. It's a luxury. I have huge plane anxiety, but I don't expect anyone else to make accommodations for that."

nottheonion,ff45vs9,t1_ff32u6w,1579556224.0,"I don't really see why you posted this. Are you saying the people who believe the title just need a mindset shift? The problem isn't that people want something for nothing, the problem is people are losing faith in capitalism to provide a better life."
nottheonion,ff454l2,t1_ff35arl,1579555749.0,We can't all be that person. That's not how capitalism works.
masskillers,ff39imb,t1_fezwi9a,1579536855.0,"I don't think it was notoriety. If you look at the timeline of his last year you see a clear degeneration. He lost his one IRL friend, stopped going on public forums, and seemingly lost interest in life completely. His last few months he barely did anything at all that didn't involve being in his room. During Hurricane Sandy he did nothing at all when the power went out supposedly. Then in the last few days he sustained a ""bloody"" head wound, which I think could have had an effect on him carrying out the shooting, but that's just speculation.

From this timeline it seems he was looking for an exit above all, the shooting seemed to be a byproduct of his wanting to die. He posted about wanting to have been born a chimp, and regarded ape society as better than ours. It's clear he could not handle being alive, and he chose a method of suicide that played into his mass murder fascination."
popheads,fezbork,t1_fez6p35,1579455734.0,It's got lots of buildup in the prechorus and the chorus is big
SandersForPresident,fetl394,t1_fesy3i1,1579376445.0,I'm disappointed by Biden. I thought he was good during Obama's presidency and even after. His speeches on grief were well articulated and full of emotion. But now it seems he's just an old man yelling at a cloud.
AmItheAsshole,fepp4x6,t1_fenajnt,1579326669.0,"Wow, what a post. Are you okay?"

patientgamers,fenqejq,t1_fen0ptm,1579289242.0,"TLOU drones are downvoting you for an opinion, which is not what the downvote button is for."
John_Frusciante,fen3ucv,t3_epzad6,1579276370.0,What I take from John is to always be learning. For example when writing a song it's useful to start the process by trying to apply some new concept as a basis for it.
ADHD,fen3dpg,t3_eq1xjq,1579276077.0,I haven't yet but kinda wish I could. The shit talking I get at work really hurts.
ADHD,fen37nj,t3_eptmse,1579275970.0,"Vyvanse has had the opposite effect on me. While it helps with task saliancy and starting tasks, my organization is a lot worse. I can't organize for shit on Vyvsnse"
google,fek9azd,t1_fej5ujk,1579195289.0,Why does google keep doing this. They keep making their website styles worse with each update.

RedHotChiliPeppers,fehprn1,t1_feat5j5,1579121433.0,"I think I might be the only one disappointed by john coming back. His solo music, especially his EP Outsides was the reason I started making music myself. I love his solo work"
RedHotChiliPeppers,fehpblx,t1_fecthrr,1579121175.0,He seems to be the type where making music has to get him somewhere artistically. If it's not a good process then in probably made him feel miserable.
AmItheAsshole,fehj39u,t1_fehhu47,1579117572.0,I think its the case of ESH then
AmItheAsshole,fehh0y7,t1_fehgkwz,1579116363.0,"You're making a lot of assumptions. The facts are he asked her, and he refused. He didn't communicate that he was going to let her off anytime soon. 

He had many excuses, some of them straight up illegal ""I'm not stopping off a girl here with no coat""

You need to reread the story."
AmItheAsshole,fehgcde,t1_fehfvpe,1579115966.0,"In her version, he refused with excuses that didn't say he was going to let her out. You pull off to the side of the road immidietely when it's safe. You dont have the right to say no."
AmItheAsshole,fehg243,t1_fehf6hg,1579115796.0,"Um, ya they are under obligation to let you out. You can't say no to not letting someone out, you say ""yes I'll pull over as soon as its safe"" and then clearly show you making that effort.

You dont say ""no"" and continue driving, that's some Ted Bundy shit."
AmItheAsshole,fehfohz,t1_fehc8fb,1579115576.0,I can't even debunk this cause your comment made me do angry. YTA

AmItheAsshole,fehcm3t,t3_ep1qtx,1579113798.0,I'm gonna go against the grain and say NTA. So much wasted plastic. Just because you're pregnant does not give you the right to create needless waste
popheads,fefr8ie,t1_fefow1m,1579062875.0,"Where I'm from in Canada radio plays the same songs everyday. The radio literally plays ""reminding me"" by shawn hook and vanessa Hudgens everyday and has done that for 4 years."

popheads,feajh5p,t1_feafj64,1578949586.0,Lmao if you're tryna say he's a plant that's funny.
popheads,fead6ku,t1_fea4rh7,1578947165.0,That's interesting to say considering he's one of the few pop stars who actually came from nothing. I support him purely for that.
