controlgame,fdhdtww,t3_elaa71,1578420586.0,"As someone who played the shit out of horizon zero dawn, I would recommend buying this game IF it’s a cheap enough price. I find it’s an odd game to recommend because the good parts are on par with some of the best games I’ve ever played but the issues and problems I have are more in line with independent and small time studios. 

The games atmosphere is one of the best, if not the best that I’ve seen of its kind. It has the perfect balance of creepily normal and reality breaking factors that make you feel like you’re just on the edge of understanding the world as a whole throughout the entire game. The gameplay is great, keeping the transition from “out of her depth civilian” to “telekinetic badass” relatively smooth. 

The few issues I have with the game would ordinarily be quite minor, but they seem to make themselves known for much more of the game. Difficulty level seemed change inconsistently through my first play through, rarely did I come away from an encounter without thinking it was either too hard or too easy. Many aspects of the story can be uninteresting or forgettable, not unlike the main character. 

Many technical issues remain unfixed since release. 

If you can get past the awkward take off and clunky dialogue, control remains an addictive game though, seeming to leave  most who play it eager to explore every nook and cranny of its diverse environments and intriguing lore.

The general impression I got from this game was that of an unfinished masterpiece, and considering DLCs and expansions, I’d say that it’s worth a buy now that the price has come down a little."
