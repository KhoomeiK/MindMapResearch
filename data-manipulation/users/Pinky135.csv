Yes it is. But maybe it's time for him to finally get thrown into the deep end and be an adult. He's been with you for 16 years, he never learned to take care of himself and he obviously doesn't want to change that. If he's alone out there he will have to. He needs a tough lesson, throw him out. No 'maybe he'll change', because you've seen he'll fall back in his old ways.

To make it a bit easier on your conscience you can help him get a place for himself. Make sure he can afford it and then leave him to get his life together. If he asks you for financial aid, help him set up a budget and don't give/borrow him money. Not ever. He needs to learn the hard way."

The screening was adapted a few years ago, instead of everyone getting routine screenings every 1-2 years, regardless of HPV infection, the HPV testing comes with the first screening. If no HPV is found, the next screening is in 2 years. This takes a lot of stress out of the offices, because the attendance is very, very high. Doctors simply couldn't get all those women in for only a pap smear so they trained nurses to do it.

Some liver enzymes do rise, but not to levels that indicate liver failure.

Your decision to taper down on the dose is good. Acetaminophen is a drug you can safely taper down with on your own. It's good of you to take your dr's advice and not take the opiates, as those can be addictive and would have required the doctor to help taper you down to zero. Acetaminophen is not addictive and does not leave you with the nasty withdrawal effects opiates can have.

Abuse in relationships often goes through a long, slow buildup and can creep into it as years pass.
