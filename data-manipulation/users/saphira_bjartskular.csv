Nah, think I'll go back to pirating, thanks. I'll go back to paying when they go back to not being shitcunts. Not OP, but it's not about the money. I can afford it.

TrueOffMyChest,fcg4pha,t1_fcam0bh,1577636432.0,"The problem with childhood trauma and PTSD is it doesn't stop when you stop being a child. It can fuck with your head to the point where you find pain in some of the shit most people would consider a basic consequence of being alive (rejection, failed relationships, things that wouldn't cause lasting distress to healthy people). These events contribute to a continuation of harm that can be incredibly difficult to overcome without external help and can just make it worse and worse.

It's not a matter of ""getting over yourself."" The brain is a pattern-recognition device, and if you went through emotional or physical trauma as a child, that can color how you perceive things into adulthood; your brain's just doing the thing it has evolved to do. It's still completely fucking valid and there are so many people out there who spend their careers/lives helping others overcome it. 

Stay strong, look for help if you feel you need it (and maybe even if you don't feel you do). Everyone can use a visit to someone who looks after their mental and emotional health as much as their physical health.
