I was just looking at additional ones in case the competition is fierce and we don't win. You have to be accepted to be nominated first, and then to actually win an award is up to the organization hosting it. It would be out of my hands after applying. 

Why wouldn't you want recognition for hard work? How could it not benefit your company and bottom line? It would provide further reason for clients to choose my company over others and further legitimacizes our service. Just because I am seeking additional awards options isn't ""begging"" rather, it's forward thinking and looking at the endgame. If I win an award, yeah that would be fantastic. If I don't, I'm not going to be upset about it because I know there's a lot of valuable, interesting and innovative businesses out there as well and they also deserve recognition.

In fact, by [2030, all new construction in Canada will have to be NZE ready](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/stories/construction-innovation/laying-foundation-net-zero-energy-ready-building-codes-2030).
