education,ffpbn85,t3_eudnsi,1580091017.0,"1. Have a teacher persona. 
2. Be consistent.
3. Create structure. 

Students will see what they can get away with. Even if they’re good at first, at some point they will purposely act up. They’ll even pit you against your cooperating teacher. Explain what your expectations are in a clear concise manner.

You are not their friend but you are an adult who cares about them. 

Touch base with each one of them at some point early on in regards to their work/behavior. It means they matter as individuals.

Depending on where you teach, some of your students are coming from horrendous home lives. It affects them. Try to help them understand that while it sucks, the world holds them to the same expectations.

There are usually one or two students that once they’re good with you, all the other students will be good with you."

education,ff0hov3,t3_er1od8,1579468946.0,"I was an IB student in the early 90s in Missouri. I found out as a senior that if I had taken all the IB courses, rather than two, that a very few colleges would offer me college credit if I scored above a certain point on all the tests. So, ultimately, it was a waste of time for me to worry about it. 

I went to Washington University in St. Louis and they didn't recognize any IB credit. (This was the 90s though, so I can't comment on it today). Rockhurst College in KC told me that I would be given 9 credits if I had the full certificate, which would have required me to go back in time and take classes that I didn't sign up for. University of Evansville didn't recognize IB credit.

Honestly, talk to colleges too. In Illinois, a lot of colleges don't really give you any college credit for AP anymore unless you get the highest score on the test. (I'm a high school teacher). So, they're good for helping students understand college level expectations, but may not end up giving your student any college credits."
