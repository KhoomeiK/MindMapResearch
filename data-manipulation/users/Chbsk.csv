The current socioeconomic structure bubbles corrupt and greedy entities to the top and hands them power. No one actively wants to be oppressed by giant corporations/governments/politicians and between the growing gap in power, money, technology, techniques and influence it is increasingly difficult to fight against them."

onejoke,fegzz6h,t1_feg7nwq,1579106258.0,"Being tall and short are opposites. Both cannot be beneficial for the same thing. They are either non factors or one of them is relatively a ""defect"". That is the point I'm making.

If the condition you are discussing is debilitating to physiological well being then yes, you can call it a defect. Red hair and white skin is not a debilitating condition in our modern age.

There is no real benefit to having slightly different phenotypes in many aspects of life. You also have no authority or basis to arbitrarily decide that a specific frequency of some phenotype has to occur for it to be considered normal. I'm not pleading to your emotions at all here. You just don't. But I understand. Social sciences can be subjective. We are discussing cold, hard truth. 

If you absolutely must prescribe to some specific confidence interval (no idea why) to describe people as defected then it would be weird if you didn't go with the 3-sigma rule. Which would include 99.7% of all people."
onejoke,feg0x4j,t1_fdjoywg,1579072215.0,"My entire career and field of study is deeply rooted in statistics and maths and I can certainly say you're wrong about how values outside a confidence interval are defects. Not because I'm on anyone's side. You're just purely, objectively wrong.

For example, if I have a Gaussian probability distribution function of the incidence of hair colour then it encompasses red hair. The existence of red hair is a valid value. It does not include naturally green hair. That is an anomaly (still a stretch to call it a defect since it does not impede the function of hair).

The permutations of specific chromosomes and the phenotype associated with them are logically on a spectrum (its why humans vary so much such as no two people having the same iris). These mutation exist as a probability distribution function as well. Intersex is a valid value on this distribution. Dragon wings are an anomaly (as far as we know).

All this aside, calling someone a defect is very subjective. People are not things. They are not designed for a specific purpose. From Usain Bolt's perspective, you could be a defect since you can barely run as fast as him. Or tall people are defective because they cannot fit smaller places.

Tl;dr You're objectively wrong."

quityourbullshit,fcrylhg,t1_fcqardf,1577908436.0,"So when I consulted the family doctor I was really worried I had some kind of tumor or something in my brain (no medical knowledge whatsoever) so I asked him to recommend me for an MRI. He simply told me that he can do so if I wish but his professional opinion was just that I was dealing with ice pick headaches and there's not much he can do so I just left it at that. They typically happen around 2~3 times a year and it's very spontaneous so I can't really take medicine for it I think. Luckily I only had one attack in 2019 so fingers crossed.

I looked up paroxysmal hemicrania and it does sound really similar to my issue. Mine is on the left side if that matters at all. Thank you so much for the info!"

Overwatch,fcnosn7,t1_fcmskc6,1577815576.0,"I'm a little confused about the math here.

Deadeye ramps up as follows:

0.2s - 1.0s : 80 dmg

1.0s - 1.5s : 137 dmg

1.5s - 6.2s : 2585 dmg

With the 5 Windows it should grant (80+137+2585)*6 = 16,812 dmg which it does as tested previously. 

But the deflection through 4 Windows and a Zen orb only grants double dmg?"
