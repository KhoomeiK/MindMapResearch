witcher,ffebscu,t1_ffcv8op,1579842423.0,"Man, you just reminded me how much I hated playing the first game. I couldn’t stand the mechanics, and it was a shame because I loved the story and had read a few of the books before the game came out so I was pumped. I got about halfway through the game before uninstalling it, though, because the mechanics were just atrocious. I *hated* the combat most of all. So clunky and just all around lame. Good story, but shit mechanics."
witcher,ffebha9,t1_ffcqnfb,1579842143.0,"For some reason, as soon as I got to Touissant in my first playthrough I immediately thought of Don Quixote. Seeing the windmills I couldn’t help but remember the famous scene where Quixote attacks some of them thinking they are giants. Later on as I was going through the posts on one of the notice boards I ran across one that read something like “Knights Herald, I respect what you do and all but *please* stop attacking the windmills. They’ve done nothing to you.” I thought that was a cool little reference. There’s also a place of interest called “Dulcinea Windmill,” named after the woman he’s obsessed with, and a few other references. Before seeing any of these I was thinking of Don Quixote, so it was nice to know it wasn’t just me."

It was basically just mentioned that she has chestnut hair in the books and that’s pretty well it (and chestnut in polish is a different color than what we call chestnut in English; it’s more of a red tint, though not as red as in the games)."
memes,ff40i8d,t1_ff3mvq0,1579552878.0,"I remember when I was like 10 or 12 there was a commercial for something at a fast food restaurant being only a dollar and in said commercial a guy pulls out a single dollar bill, hands it to the cashier and receives his item. I rode my bike to town once and ordered the exact same item because I only had a single dollar bill. To my surprise it ended up being $1.06 after tax and the cashier acted like I was the biggest idiot in the world for only giving her a dollar. She cancelled the order and told me to scour the parking lot for loose change or go home. Ever since that moment I have absolutely fucking hated commercials for dollar menu items or any other item that is priced at an even dollar amount and shows the customer handing them that amount sans tax. I still get so worked up about it, and I’m about to turn 30. I remember how gutted I felt that time and it ruins my whole day."

Iamactuallyverybadass,ff2ik76,t1_ff2hxc4,1579507696.0,"Just because they “work” does not mean they belong. Yes, if you take out what is between the commas the sentence still works, but the sentence works just as well, if not better, without them. 

They hired drug traffickers to sell massive amounts of cocaine in the US in order to fund a terrorist organization. It’s that simple. You don’t need to separate the part about them selling massive amounts of cocaine. There’s zero reason to separate it and the commas are wholly unnecessary and give the sentence pauses that serve no purpose. “They hired drug traffickers, to sell massive amounts of cocaine, in order to fund a terrorist organization,” makes everything more complicated than it should be. Just because they technically *could* work doesn’t mean they belong. Any editor who knew what they were doing would take them out because they are *unnecessary*, which is the entire point of this conversation. They’re not needed. They serve no purpose. They hinder the sentence more than they help it.

And yes, I am an avid reader and I also write for a newspaper where we adhere to very strict rules about punctuation. This isn’t being strict, though. They’re just unnecessary, plain and simple."
Iamactuallyverybadass,ff2hp3d,t1_ff2hfw4,1579506600.0,"The second and third commas (I’m not about to type out the entire transcript, just just count the commas; the first, after “1996,” is okay) are 100% incorrect and make the whole thing an absolute pain in the ass to read. They just don’t belong at all. There should not be a pause of any kind there and the sentence should have zero punctuation aside from that very first comma and the period at the end."
