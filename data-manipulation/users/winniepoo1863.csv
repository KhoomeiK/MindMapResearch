volleyball,fff0ou5,t3_eta34i,1579872432.0,"For only playing for a few months your coordination is pretty good. It took me way longer to adjust my rhythm. Anyway, as the other user said, you need a bit more speed on the last steps. I know in boys volleyball is done more often then in girls, but the 4 step approach is a bit tricky. Considering your height, it may help you gain a bit more momentum. From the video you didn't land to far forward, so you jumped corectly. So keep in mind, a faster approach (you will need to adjust your timing a bit but considering your first months result, it shouldn't be hard) and using the momentum to jump upward, not forward . Keep practicing and hope to see you in an official match soon!"

MakeupAddiction,ffd8og3,t1_ffd82gs,1579815590.0,"If you want a good detail brush, buy one from an art store. One of the make up artists I follow and also one for whose trainees i stood as a model for practicing admitted that paint  brushes, in the case of eyeliner, work the best. And since the line on your face isn't much thicker than a wing, I think it could work. Also, the ones in the art stores might be cheaper than those sold as 'eyeliner brush'"
MakeupAddiction,ffd8cn2,t3_esv19l,1579815399.0,"It's a good start. Your eyecolour is beautiful, ngl. You could also try learning how to define a bit more your eyebrows, meaning filling any spots where the skin is more visible. From the angle i can't tell for sure, but your eyebrows look normal, not bushy, so you could try making them thicker if you want. Good luck on your make up journey and really excited to see updates!"

MakeupAddiction,ffd75c3,t3_esx09b,1579814731.0,"I also suggest adressing to a professional. As another comment said, you arms and neck are also good indicators. Your foundation must be the right undertone but it also needs to blend nicely with the rest of your body (like in summer you can't use your go to foundation because your arms tan inevitably and even if you cover your skin, the contrast will be pretty obvious and switching the foundation colour is necessary)."
MakeupAddiction,ffd6q9b,t3_esxhd2,1579814497.0,"Firstly, your face and skin look amazing. It looks intersting, the only suggestion is to clean up the line a bit more, to define it better"
MakeupAddiction,ffd6ith,t3_esxjgk,1579814382.0,"Focus on your skin to look healthy rather than make up itself. Also I admire how you manage this busy lifestyle. Is suggest resuming to only a few key products and quality make up. A good concealer (can't stop from nyx has great reviews), powder ( i think loose is more resitant), mascara and a those 2 in 1 things for tinting lips and cheecks, and if you want a bit more, go with a mini palette with some tones which you can use as bronzer, eyeshadow, highlighter as well as for eyebrows if it is pigmented enough. Also a mini moisturizer and a lip balm will help protect your skin. As for tools, beauty blender, a fluffy brush for powder and one for eyeshadow (usually glitters and shimmers best apply with fingers so no need to have many brushes). I think this could easy fit in a small pouch. Hope this helped and good luck with the school and the job. You go girl!!!"
MakeupAddiction,ffd4g06,t3_esy20c,1579813224.0,"I have tried nyx compact powder, the one a bit greenish for tonig down redness. It had a lot of flashback and also dropped it and imediately the content broke. Now I have the loose powder from make up revolution, shade banana. I only wore it a couple times but it's pretty ok. The price is very affordable, but one pretty big downside for me is the lid (it's very small and my powder brush is bigger than it). Check more reviews for it so you can be sure, but for the money, it does a pretty good job. Also if you are a beginer, don't go for the most expensive brushes at first. I bought mine from aliexpress and don't have any regrets. They are not amazing, but they help you get the feel of applying and are really, really cheap. Hope it helps"
MakeupAddiction,ffd3r76,t3_esyg2l,1579812841.0,"Your eyelook is amazing! It also goes really well with the eyecolour ( I feel all the brown eyecolours go well with most of the colours).

haikyuu,fezoda6,t3_eqwpyp,1579459643.0,"Regarding hinata's jump, it is exaggerated both from the jump itself  but also from the angle it is usually drawn (like those powervolleyball clickbaits). The higher you jump, the more your leg muscles develop. You also need to be light enough so you can lift from the ground. Considering hinata's jump, he should have bodybuilder legs and already some knee weaknesses. One weird thing in the anime which I just realised is the lack of that tape used for muscle pain. In real life, there are more players who have those long, usually colourful strips rather then their fingers taped"
haikyuu,feznft6,t3_eqx80i,1579459324.0,"All the other comments are corect. Shortly, mbs are usually tall and it takes them more time to reach the deffense position. This and their natural reflexes for jumping instead of deffense makes harder for them to receive. Short players usually have quicker reflexes, better stability and control, thus they are usually trained as liberos. However, if another player besides the setter is generally not so keen on receiving, liberos can swap them aswell. There is allowed only one libero on the field and on the team roster 2. Most pro teams have 2 liberos. You can see them clearly at the team line up: one standing after the captain (the second starting from the net) and one at the end of the line"
haikyuu,fezmc9n,t3_eqxapw,1579458956.0,"I am shocked! The hype was well worth it. Two teams full of star players. You could feel the tension before the start of the game. Hinata's position came a bit as a shock (I expected him to be a outside hitter) but it increases the overall team deffense (I feel he is now kind of the baby of Daichi and Noya) as he dreamed of. The wait was worth it. However, there is the question from the previous chapters regarding Noya's absence and the new one, about Tendou. I hope chapter 381 could answer at least one of these questions"

I understand it is standard for the team to rewatch the plays and better that the referee point of view for example, but is not the best to judge the front line players. The other comments were right, the timing is a bit off. Arriving early meand you need to delay the jump and keep the tension in the muscles more in order to slow down your rhythm a bit but this, aswell as the whole spiking steps, can be perfected through practice. While in the air, due to the timing, your spiking point is a bit too close to you, meaning you move your arm more upward than usual, leading to loss of momentum. It took me a pretty long time to adjust my timing and ended up with a pretty weird tehnique but the best advice would be practice and advice from your coach. Work separetly with your setter and ask him to set botched bpasses too, in order to simulate the real deal better. Also working without the ball to perfect your timing and body movement, focusing more on yourself and where your ideal spot to hit the ball is may help."
