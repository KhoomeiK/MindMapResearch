nutrition,ffjqcek,t3_etvtsk,1580004254.0,I think it's incredible. It gives the gut a break from working so often and allows it to heal. It also provides lots of natural energy and mental focus

addiction,ff7msce,t1_ff7mm44,1579653286.0,"Excellent! So yeah, just imagine how powerful you will feel if you can get 30 days of NoFap goin! I think it works wonders, and PMO is one of the *biggest* producers of dopamine, period. You got this"
addiction,ff7l742,t1_ff7koai,1579652186.0,"I can totally relate! I encourage you to try the dopamine fast, or at the least aim for 30 days of NoFap.

Please feel free to keep in touch and keep me up to date on your progress"
addiction,ff7k6ul,t1_ff7jpqr,1579651486.0,"Oh! I am so sorry, I thought you said TM instead of TMI. Yes I practice vipassana and have completed one of the retreats, it was life changing. I'm sorry to hear you feel stuck. The only other thing I could think to suggest then is a dopamine fast, if you want to look into those. Basically just trying to bring all your dopamine receptors way back down so you have less of a drive for the high dopamine producing behaviors/addictions"
addiction,ff7jafi,t1_ff7j5jf,1579650874.0,I'm glad to hear you already have experience meditating! But I have to say from both research and experience that TM cannot provide the same result as mindfulness when it comes to trauma and anxiety. Sorry to hear about your job but just do the best you can for now. This is the best advice I can give
addiction,ff7j1qe,t3_es3c80,1579650708.0,"Hi! First off let me just say I know how you feel. Second, I have a suggestion but I don't know if you will like it. What I recommend you do is meditate. Sit quietly with no music or distractions of any kind. At first it will be tough but try to stick with it. The longer you can just be still and observe your thoughts, the more answers will come to you. It's really quite remarkable. If you try this and enjoy it, consider attending a full 10 day silent retreat. It has the potential to unlock and heal things inside you you can't imagine. Practice mindfulness meditation, and you will see how it can help unpack repressed trauma and heal your original wound. Feel free to DM me anytime"

I just want to say first that it is even *more* dangerous to abruptly quit benzodiazapan medications like that one you are taking so please be safe there first and foremost. Second, are you able to see a therapist? Was there any type of specific trauma that occurred when you were 15? People tend to have difficulty with things like anxiety and depression unless they can really get to the root issue, which often involves seeing a therapist or having a meditation practice. Great work staying sober this long for sure and please continue to do so. As far as the aches and pains I would highly suggest yoga and meditation—they can both be beneficial for chronic pain.

While games aren't as bad as most drugs, sure, they still do produce high levels of dopamine which at the root is what we're all sort of addicted to in some way. And also in almost all cases, it's because we are trying to avoid something. I bet if you can put down the games and get serious about school your mind will rebel at first since the school won't produce all that dopamine, BUT in the end you'll be very happy you were able to reintroduce serious discipline in your life and make a vastly positive change while you are still so young!
