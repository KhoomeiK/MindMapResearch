He was always a bit right leaning, but it all came to a head my senior year. He came to my house and was just hanging out with my brother and Mom when I hear a scream, something like ""get out you fucking piece of shit!"" It was obviously said by my brother. Well, my friend had been telling my family all about how it would be best if every black person was just sent back to Africa from the U.S., especially given their ""violent tendencies."" He also said other awful things, but from this you probably get the idea. Anyways, never really spoke to him after that, despite years of close friendship. And  interestingly enough, he has an identical twin who I remain friends with years later."

With just a library I.d, it gives you free access to 5 movies a month. Unlike Netflix and others, these are mostly classic movies like those from the criterion collection, and a whole bunch of thoughtfully selected newer ones. 5% may not sound like a lot, but over the course of a month I’ve found it’s prefect."
