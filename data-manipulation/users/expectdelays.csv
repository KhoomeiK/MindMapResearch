WTF,fgk941u,t1_fgk2sq0,1580860165.0,I was watching a docu on cat hoarders and some of them keep their homes/litter boxes very clean. To the point of waking up in the middle of the night to clean like 15 litter boxes and vacuum the floors.  Then of course the rest of the people's homes were a complete wreck.

Also forgot to mention I set up a Bluetooth speaker near the food and played a YouTube video of a mom cat meowing for her kittens.  They came right out.
WTF,fgdegyq,t1_fgctwff,1580681630.0,"My wife and I foster a lot of kittens and last year we had a group of 8 ferals in our ""foster room"".  The kittens managed to find an opening in the wall so they all decided to go into the floor where we couldn't get them and they refused to come out. So that's what I'm guessing happened here.   Oh, and to finish the story we did eventually get the kittens to come out by putting food on the side of the room furthest from the hole, me hiding under some blankets and waiting for them to come out to get the food.  I then just put my body in front of the hole while my wife came in to the room and collected the kittens."
