Dems need to rebuild from the ground up, fighting over towns and cities to build a large pool of mayors and governors to draw from with popular support, to push for a majority in both houses of congress. Until then, whoever gets elected president will be a figurehead at best, and used by the republicans to demonize future dem candidates at worst"
politics,fed6efa,t1_fecso9u,1579001101.0,"Sure a heart attack wont, but half the government being republican majority, and the other half compromising with center-right dems to at least *have* representation, thatll stop him.

You cant throw a a left-leaning president into an election where every other branch is compromising with center-right just to get their party in office. Dems need a majority, then they need to maintain that majority for a few elections to start shifting the focus of the party from ""compromising"" to ""leading""; move the party's reps from center-right to center, then center-left. *then* their will be the political power for bernie to actually push forward any of his ideas.

Electing him 2020 will leave him with a lot of plans that will all die in congress"
politics,fed67hi,t1_fed5222,1579000845.0,"Eh, it's more because were still fighting to get majority for dems in half the government, and of the dems that *have* been electable, most are center-right and therefore wouldnt properly support bernie.

Bernie is the kind of president you throw in after 2-3 consecutive voting periods of strong dem turnout, where the majority is secured and you can start worrying about ""purity"" tests to fight over what ideals need to be represented.

But instead dems are fighting over those ideals *now*, splitting their base and support, while republicans largely present a monolith following a party line, allowing their comparatively weaker representation to take a majority."

Swords were for honor duels, executions, and last stands in a losing battle. Only a few historical figures had the heroic abandon to charge into battle with a sword alongside their men, and most of them are only known because of the way they died.

Also, even in japan, the *preferred* weapon of mobilized armies was still the spear or pike. Swords were more common among honor guards, personal retinues, and cavalry, because quality swords are too expensive to mass produced for levied peasants. Only time japan used sword en masse was when they were importing them from china, who had the infrastructure to support Japan's comparatively much smaller armies. And even then, due to the swords breaking often, they moved away from them as soon as other doctrines proved viable."
