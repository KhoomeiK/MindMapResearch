Also why people drop the last of the 3 digits and add the suffix in to refer to models. For example the 777-300 would be the 773."

Legal tender is valid in discharging debt already incurred but you are not forced to accept it for goods or services. That’s an important distinction.

“United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.""

“This statute means that all United States money as identified above are a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a creditor. There is, however, no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless there is a State law which says otherwise.”"

simracing,fcsjl9g,t1_fcrpojj,1577917869.0,"If anyone is curious: the reason for this is the rules say you have to use driver force only when braking (your road car there are systems that multiply the force on your behalf). As well, you’re pretty much always going to only smash on the brake as late as possible in a given turn so “light braking” doesn’t really translate over.
