Advice,fef3d7z,t1_fef0lsu,1579047219.0,"Heh.. yeah.. that's my conundrum: talk now, or talk next time..

I just don't want to 'try to let it go' and wind up suppressing my anger and having it fester. 

I don't HAVE to be friends with everyone at work, but it makes it a heck of a lot easier to get through the day when everyone's getting along and working together."
Advice,fef26ma,t1_fef00ii,1579046422.0,"I know I can't control other people, but I feel like my supervisor and I have a relationship that is good enough for her to *maybe* listen to me? We're usually pretty friendly, and she's at least talked out issues with the other secretary and apologized to me before when she knew she was wrong..

I kind of want to talk to her about it, but I don't know if I should tactfully confront her now or just let this time slide and wait for another situation like this to arise to be more assertive asking for help, then.

I also know that the Office Manager and the Doctor I work for would be VERY upset if I told them what happened.

And yes, I should probably get a different job, but I really do like some of my coworkers, some patients, and this job is growing on me. I'm getting better at working through my anxieties, better at my job, and well... I kinda want to stay at least another 9 months so I can have the amount  of experience needed to get a better paying job."
