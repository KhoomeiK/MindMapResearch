It looks like people are basically saying bleach is ineffective when they are pushing their own product or process (and, ironically,  often their products contain bleach).

Several caveats to my blanket statement that “bleach works” is that, while it will work on porous surfaces (many sites say it won’t), it’s not the best for penetrating porous surfaces.  So to fix that, add a drop of dish soap to your bleach mix.  That will give you the surfactant you need to help the bleach penetrate porous surfaces.

Also, don’t use pure bleach out of the bottle (the concentration you can buy varies in strength depending on where you buy it - some are stronger than others).  Use the concentration suggested on the bottle.

Also, don’t mix bleach with ammonia.  It forms a toxic gas that is dangerous for humans and pets.

Here’s a good informative source:  https://www.cdc.gov/mold/control_mold.htm

One more comment.  The reason you can’t create a “super-mold” with bleach, analogous to a multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria, is because in order for a bacterium to become antibiotic resistant it only needs a couple of gene mutations to render the antibiotic ineffective.  Whereas bleach is a chemical process that damages any organic material it comes in contact with.  For a mold to become resistant to bleach would require a combination and number of mutations heretofore unknown in the annals of science.  It would be like a mold mutating to something that is resistant to fire.

Also, in the lab, when we wanted to kill our molds, we used bleach.  There was literally nothing better.  It also destroyed most toxic materials the fungus produced (mycotoxins like aflatoxin).

I hope this info is helpful to you."
WTF,ff3v1cm,t1_ff3kcdz,1579549465.0,"I would say no.  Vinegar is actually acetic acid, which, believe it or not, could serve as a nutrient for the mold.  Bleach will not serve as a nutrient and is actually toxic to the mold.  Vinegar is good for hard water deposits, but not for mold."

Floor vents are vastly superior to ceiling vents (esp in winter because the warm air collects at the ceiling), but slab foundations are cheaper so most new construction has slab foundations and vents in the ceiling.

I'm not sure about the 10%.  It's a number that has been thrown around but I'd have to spend more time looking into it to give you references.  Basically, the cows are worn out in about three years, not six.  I don't know if you are actively running a dairy or not, but the prices are such that it's necessary that the cow produces as much as possible when they are being milked, so they're producing something like 10x more than they need to feed a calf.

Once the cow is not sufficiently productive - off it goes to the slaughterhouse.  And as I said above, that's looking more like about three years.  And if you understand the dairy industry, you know they have calf farms where they're bringing up replacement cows ready to slot in once the current milking cow's production begins to taper off.  So the replacements are ready to go.  It is not an expensive process to replace the cows with fresh, or, rather, the expense of keeping a calf farm has already been incurred.

You may not have been involved in the business as it is right now - razor thin margins and losing money as often as being profitable.  I would not want to be a dairy farmer in this market.

American Journal of Pathology
Summary:
Current research suggests that the flu may predispose to secondary bacterial infections, which account for a significant proportion of mortality during flu pandemics. 

Current research suggests that the flu may predispose to secondary bacterial infections, which account for a significant proportion of mortality during flu pandemics.
The report by Lee et al. appears in the February 2010 issue of The American Journal of Pathology.
Influenza affects between three and five million people annually, causing up to 500,000 deaths worldwide. While most people will recover in one to two weeks, others will develop life-threatening conditions such as pneumonia or bronchitis. High-risk groups for seasonal influenza include the very young and old, people with compromised immune systems, and pregnant women. However, during influenza pandemics, mortality may be significant in previously healthy young adults.
A common complication of flu infection is a secondary ""super-infection"" by bacteria, which greatly increases the morbidity and mortality of the disease. The most common bacterial agents found following flu pandemics have been Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Group A Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, reports of infection with antibiotic-resistant strains have been increasing in recent years.
To explore the mechanisms governing the increased pathogenesis of flu upon super-infection, a group led by Dr. Sally R. Sarawar of the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, San Diego, California confirmed that otherwise nonlethal influenza and H. influenzae infections cause high mortality rates in mice when flu infection precedes H. influenzae infection. Their data confirm a restricted time period for this heightened susceptibility and highlight that excessive bacterial, and not viral, growth is associated with increased lethality. The fact that this increased mortality was observed in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice suggests that even normal healthy people are at increased risk for complications following bacterial super-infection.
Lee et al. suggest that the ""lethal synergy between influenza virus and the bacterial respiratory pathogen, H. influenzae, is mediated by innate immunity. They observed that severe damage to the airways was an early event in the co-infected mice, eventually leading to death. This underscores the need for early antiviral and antibiotic treatment to combat severe disease in human patients and highlights the importance of vaccination and effective hygiene measures to prevent secondary bacterial infections during influenza infection.
This new model will be useful for further investigating the mechanisms underlying severe disease caused by the interaction between influenza virus and bacteria, which may have resulted in numerous deaths during influenza pandemics and continues to constitute a significant clinical problem in susceptible individuals."" Currently ongoing studies suggest that this model may also be useful for identifying target molecules for the development of novel therapeutic agents and strategies.

Basically livestock operations use antibiotics in exactly the *worst* possible way because using some every day whether the animal is sick or not (which is what they do)is the easiest way to create antibiotic resistant bacteria.  And if you read the article we are commenting on here, you will see that China is using one of our “last line of defense” antibiotics on their livestock.

The problem is not the family doctor prescribing antibiotics for the flu.  In fact, that is not always a bad idea because a flu (a viral disease that won’t respond to antibiotics) can result in a secondary bacterial infection.  If this regularly happens to you, keep those antibiotics on hand in case this happens.  For example, the flu resulting in bacterial pneumonia.

When one country allows a citizen of another country to enter, the country that you are REQUESTING to enter has a right to determine whether or not they want you there, and the ESTA does not do that:

>ESTA does not guarantee entry to the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers make final determination of admissibility (entry) to the United States and may cancel/deny ESTA at any time during travel, for example for suspicions of giving false information in the application.

It doesn’t matter if a country is a democracy or a totalitarian government.  **They** set the rules as to whether they want you in their country or not.  Not you, nor an ESTA.  If you don’t want to show them the contents of your phone, that is your choice.  But if they ask and you refuse, you will be turned away at the border.

Before Uber and Lyft, cabs were just as bad.  Trying to call a cab was an exercise in futility.  Sometimes someone would answer the phone, sometimes a cab would come - eventually.  Sometimes they said they would come and never arrive.  All in all, the success rate was probably about 10 percent.  Plus the cabs were so disgustingly dirty - they smelled bad, there was a greasy dirty film over everything, there were no seat belts, and usually you got treated to some racist rant by the driver.  So while I don’t approve of the Uber and Lyft business practices, there is no loss if cab companies go out of business, unless they literally clean up their act.  It’s ridiculous.  I try to help out Uber and Lyft drivers by tipping them well, in cash.

It looks like people are basically saying bleach is ineffective when they are pushing their own product or process (and, ironically,  often their products contain bleach).

Several caveats to my blanket statement that â€œbleach worksâ€ is that, while it will work on porous surfaces (many sites say it wonâ€™t), itâ€™s not the best for penetrating porous surfaces.  So to fix that, add a drop of dish soap to your bleach mix.  That will give you the surfactant you need to help the bleach penetrate porous surfaces.

Also, donâ€™t use pure bleach out of the bottle (the concentration you can buy varies in strength depending on where you buy it - some are stronger than others).  Use the concentration suggested on the bottle.

Also, donâ€™t mix bleach with ammonia.  It forms a toxic gas that is dangerous for humans and pets.

Hereâ€™s a good informative source:  https://www.cdc.gov/mold/control_mold.htm

One more comment.  The reason you canâ€™t create a â€œsuper-moldâ€ with bleach, analogous to a multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria, is because in order for a bacterium to become antibiotic resistant it only needs a couple of gene mutations to render the antibiotic ineffective.  Whereas bleach is a chemical process that damages any organic material it comes in contact with.  For a mold to become resistant to bleach would require a combination and number of mutations heretofore unknown in the annals of science.  It would be like a mold mutating to something that is resistant to fire.

Also, in the lab, when we wanted to kill our molds, we used bleach.  There was literally nothing better.  It also destroyed most toxic materials the fungus produced (mycotoxins like aflatoxin).

I hope this info is helpful to you."

I'm not sure about the 10%.  It's a number that has been thrown around but I'd have to spend more time looking into it to give you references.  Basically, the cows are worn out in about three years, not six.  I don't know if you are actively running a dairy or not, but the prices are such that it's necessary that the cow produces as much as possible when they are being milked, so they're producing something like 10x more than they need to feed a calf.

Once the cow is not sufficiently productive - off it goes to the slaughterhouse.  And as I said above, that's looking more like about three years.  And if you understand the dairy industry, you know they have calf farms where they're bringing up replacement cows ready to slot in once the current milking cow's production begins to taper off.  So the replacements are ready to go.  It is not an expensive process to replace the cows with fresh, or, rather, the expense of keeping a calf farm has already been incurred.

You may not have been involved in the business as it is right now - razor thin margins and losing money as often as being profitable.  I would not want to be a dairy farmer in this market.

Date:
January 22, 2010
Source:
American Journal of Pathology
Summary:
Current research suggests that the flu may predispose to secondary bacterial infections, which account for a significant proportion of mortality during flu pandemics. 

Current research suggests that the flu may predispose to secondary bacterial infections, which account for a significant proportion of mortality during flu pandemics.
The report by Lee et al. appears in the February 2010 issue of The American Journal of Pathology.
Influenza affects between three and five million people annually, causing up to 500,000 deaths worldwide. While most people will recover in one to two weeks, others will develop life-threatening conditions such as pneumonia or bronchitis. High-risk groups for seasonal influenza include the very young and old, people with compromised immune systems, and pregnant women. However, during influenza pandemics, mortality may be significant in previously healthy young adults.
A common complication of flu infection is a secondary ""super-infection"" by bacteria, which greatly increases the morbidity and mortality of the disease. The most common bacterial agents found following flu pandemics have been Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Group A Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, reports of infection with antibiotic-resistant strains have been increasing in recent years.
To explore the mechanisms governing the increased pathogenesis of flu upon super-infection, a group led by Dr. Sally R. Sarawar of the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, San Diego, California confirmed that otherwise nonlethal influenza and H. influenzae infections cause high mortality rates in mice when flu infection precedes H. influenzae infection. Their data confirm a restricted time period for this heightened susceptibility and highlight that excessive bacterial, and not viral, growth is associated with increased lethality. The fact that this increased mortality was observed in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice suggests that even normal healthy people are at increased risk for complications following bacterial super-infection.
Lee et al. suggest that the ""lethal synergy between influenza virus and the bacterial respiratory pathogen, H. influenzae, is mediated by innate immunity. They observed that severe damage to the airways was an early event in the co-infected mice, eventually leading to death. This underscores the need for early antiviral and antibiotic treatment to combat severe disease in human patients and highlights the importance of vaccination and effective hygiene measures to prevent secondary bacterial infections during influenza infection.
This new model will be useful for further investigating the mechanisms underlying severe disease caused by the interaction between influenza virus and bacteria, which may have resulted in numerous deaths during influenza pandemics and continues to constitute a significant clinical problem in susceptible individuals."" Currently ongoing studies suggest that this model may also be useful for identifying target molecules for the development of novel therapeutic agents and strategies.

Futurology,fe4v3ib,t1_fe4qguk,1578863093.0,"Hey, Russia was our sworn enemy not that long ago - to the extent that we had hundreds of missiles pointed at each other and the only thing stopping nuclear annihilation was â€œmutually assured destruction.â€  

And yet now we have a president who believes Putin over our own intelligence agencies, asks russia to hack the opposing party (and russia does), meets with Putin secretly, has laundered money for russians, etc. etc. etc.  I sincerely believe that tRump has been compromised by russia in some way and is acting as their agent. 

I am not someone who buys into every conspiracy theory that comes along.  But this one looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck.  So itâ€™s a duck as far as Iâ€™m concerned.  If Iâ€™m proven wrong, Iâ€™ll own my mistake, but Iâ€™m pretty sure that isnâ€™t going to happen."

science,fe4o8xa,t1_fe3ak0o,1578861293.0,Thank god you have a smart doctor.  There is a lot of misinformation in this thread.  The last thing you want during your first trimester is the flu.  A fever could result in a miscarriage or birth defects.
science,fe4nygd,t1_fe3lehv,1578861220.0,"There is so much misinformation in this thread.  You donâ€™t have the flu shot in the first trimester to pass the immunity on to the fetus. You do it so you (the mom) doesnâ€™t get the flu.  The flu and potential secondary infections will likely result in a fever, which can kill the fetus and result in a miscarriage.  If you want to make sure the baby has immunity at birth, simply get another one later on.

But fevers are terrible for early pregnancy.  Why do you think they tell moms to stay out of hot tubs.  The fever will very likely result in a miscarriage."
science,fe4n32m,t1_fe3pisu,1578860995.0,"No, it is not reasonable to wait until the second trimester.  Do you know what having the flu could likely result in if you have it during the first trimester?  A miscarriage.  A high fever from the flu or potential secondary infection such as pneumonia is very likely to cause a miscarriage during the first trimester.  That 0.005 percent is far lower than the risk to the fetus if you actually get the flu."
science,fe4m78n,t1_fe36i76,1578860782.0,"Exactly my point in multiple comments.  I was told not to get the flu vaccine when I was pregnant.  Ended up with the flu in my first trimester, which resulted in pneumonia and a high fever (high enough that they had to put me on a cooling blanket), and guess what - miscarriage. It turns out that at the time CDC recommended against flu shots while pregnant because if you did have a miscarriage, they were afraid the flu shot would be blamed.  

Now maybe I would have had a miscarriage anyway, but Iâ€™m sure that prolonged 104 degree fever did not help."
science,fe4lny4,t1_fe2jv7i,1578860571.0,"The flu shot absolutely CAN NOT increase the risk of miscarriage.  In fact, not getting the vaccine CAN increase the risk of miscarriage if you have a fever, which can kill the developing fetus (which is why they tell pregnant women to stay out of hot tubs).  Your doctor is either ill-informed or is straight up lying to you because she doesnâ€™t want to be blamed for giving you a flu shot that *you might believe* causes a subsequent miscarriage that might (wrongly) be attributed to the flu vaccine.

I cannot stress how much you need a new OBGYN.  Just go to the CDC website and look for their recommendations."
science,fe4kl4v,t1_fe2yhtn,1578860288.0,"It sounds like you are better informed than your OBGYN.  I would suggest you find another one.  If he/she doesnâ€™t know this, imagine what other things they donâ€™t know.  Or heaven forbid, they may be antivaxx, in which case you still need a new OBGYN.  I would also ask them why they are not adhering to the standard of care suggested by the CDC.  These recommendations are not new."
science,fe4jkc1,t1_fe43100,1578859982.0,"Another fun fact, tetanus and botulism are both caused by Clostridia bacteria, who are obligate anaerobes (oxygen will kill them).  The reason you get tetanus from things like stepping on nails is because the bacteria are deposited deeply enough that air cannot get to them and they can reproduce unabated.   

Iâ€™ts also why you shouldnâ€™t feed a baby honey.  It has Clostridium spores that can germinate in the babyâ€™s intestines, and cause botulism."
science,fe4ikdf,t1_fe40bib,1578859690.0,"You can still get it.  Your two year old has developed resistance to pertussis, but there are still newborns and babies with various conditions who cannot have the pertussis vaccine, so get it for them.  Get it for you also, because pertussis resistance is not life-long and having whooping cough as an adult is no walk in the park."
science,fe4hcp9,t1_fe3pv2c,1578859306.0,"Interestingly, when I had my children CDC recommended that pregnant women NOT have the flu shot.  Not for any scientific reason, but because CDC was worried that if a pregnant woman had a miscarriage after a flu shot, the flu shot would be blamed. So they were afraid of bad optics.

That opinion cost me a pregnancy.  Iâ€™m glad they finally got their heads out of their asses and are recommending flu shots - something they should have done all along.

Germany is behind the times on this.  Get the shot."
science,fe4gnt2,t3_enllpo,1578859141.0,"Yeah ~~itâ€™s~~ *not getting a flu shot and subsequently getting the flu is* also a good way to cause a miscarriage if you are in the first trimester.  Donâ€™t ask me how I know.

Plus having the flu while pregnant is dangerous because your immune system is suppressed to avoid your body rejecting the fetus.  Then you end up with things like pneumonia and necessary antibiotic use, plus the fever that causes the miscarriage.

So for the love of god, if you are pregnant or are planning on becoming pregnant get a fucking flu shot."

Futurology,fe4cv5w,t1_fe3yr8t,1578857979.0,More strict with antibiotic use in factory farming operations.
Futurology,fe4cp80,t1_fe3n2ld,1578857918.0,"Thatâ€™s where they are found, but itâ€™s not where they come from.  See my comment above in regard to antibiotic use on livestock in factory farms."
Futurology,fe4ci27,t1_fe3kud9,1578857849.0,"The problem is the irresponsible long term use of antibiotics in livestock operations - especially in factory farming where there is high animal density.  They feed the livestock antibiotics prophylactically which results in bigger healthier animals and antibiotic resistant bacteria.

Basically livestock operations use antibiotics in exactly the *worst* possible way because using some every day whether the animal is sick or not (which is what they do)is the easiest way to create antibiotic resistant bacteria.  And if you read the article we are commenting on here, you will see that China is using one of our â€œlast line of defenseâ€ antibiotics on their livestock.

The problem is not the family doctor prescribing antibiotics for the flu.  In fact, that is not always a bad idea because a flu (a viral disease that wonâ€™t respond to antibiotics) can result in a secondary bacterial infection.  If this regularly happens to you, keep those antibiotics on hand in case this happens.  For example, the flu resulting in bacterial pneumonia.

We need to stop the irresponsible use of antibiotics in factory farming operations.  That is where the resistant bacteria are coming from.  Countries that have done this are seeing their rates of antibiotic resistance plummeting."

When one country allows a citizen of another country to enter, the country that you are REQUESTING to enter has a right to determine whether or not they want you there, and the ESTA does not do that:

>ESTA does not guarantee entry to the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers make final determination of admissibility (entry) to the United States and may cancel/deny ESTA at any time during travel, for example for suspicions of giving false information in the application.

It doesnâ€™t matter if a country is a democracy or a totalitarian government.  **They** set the rules as to whether they want you in their country or not.  Not you, nor an ESTA.  If you donâ€™t want to show them the contents of your phone, that is your choice.  But if they ask and you refuse, you will be turned away at the border.

Even though I work in an urban environment, there was never a cab around when I needed one, and god help you if you tried to call and order one.  It was something out of the medieval times - like â€œsomeone will be there in an hour, plus or minus and hourâ€ if anyone even answered at all.

Before Uber and Lyft, cabs were just as bad.  Trying to call a cab was an exercise in futility.  Sometimes someone would answer the phone, sometimes a cab would come - eventually.  Sometimes they said they would come and never arrive.  All in all, the success rate was probably about 10 percent.  Plus the cabs were so disgustingly dirty - they smelled bad, there was a greasy dirty film over everything, there were no seat belts, and usually you got treated to some racist rant by the driver.  So while I donâ€™t approve of the Uber and Lyft business practices, there is no loss if cab companies go out of business, unless they literally clean up their act.  Itâ€™s ridiculous.  I try to help out Uber and Lyft drivers by tipping them well, in cash.

So that custom is probably outdated, but now itâ€™s a tradition and it continues on.  The didnâ€™t just make stupid rules.

I wouldnâ€™t judge those that are happy with their circumcised state however.  You really donâ€™t know what they are experiencing.  

Now if you wanted a REAL experiment, get a bunch of uncircumcised men, give them a survey rating how enjoyable they find sex, then circumcise them and give them the same survey.  It would need to be a huge study because there are going to be many, many confounding factors.  It would probably need to be repeated a few times because I guarantee you, the wrong questions will be asked initially.

While youâ€™re at it, survey their partners pre- and post-circumcision, to determine how their experience of sex changed.

We need statistics, not anecdotal experiences.  

Iâ€™m not up on recent research, but I do recall that there is no medical need for circumcision except that circumcised men were less likely to be infected with the AIDS virus, due to a reduced number of receptors available, but I donâ€™t know if that has held up.

So, in the end, even though my religious heritage STRONGLY encourages circumcision, my male offspring remain as they were originally made.  They can decide if they want to be circumcised when they are older and can make a more informed decision."
