childfree,fgmwiob,t1_fgle6vh,1580933373.0,Yeah. Its frustrating because the reason elderly adults are being harmed by the detergent packets is they didnt have detergent packets when they were younger.  So if you have dementia there isnt any context or knowledge of them being a dangerous item.

childfree,fgl93vu,t1_fgkmjkf,1580886492.0,"Yup.  My dad grew up on a farm and has a more conservative approach to pets, the dogs were outdoor dogs for the most part, not allowed on furniture ect.  But they had damned nice heated houses in the winter, airy ventilated houses in the summer, lots of play, and were welcome in the house to hang out with us.  Hell, the reason for the oddly wide stairs from the house to the patio in the backyard is so one of the dogs could keep laying next to the door after the renovation.  My dad is the one who asked for that design adjustment.  There are photos of me as a baby laying next to one of them just chilling.  I would army-crawl to the big backyard glass doors to look at the same dog laying in his favorite spot.

My parents taught me from an early age that animals have feelings just like people and that they need to be treated with care.  Sure, I never got along too well with cats as a kid (hyperactivity and cats don't really mix) but dogs were a fantastic fit."

GirlGamers,fgf07z7,t1_fgezcal,1580717521.0,I just played through Portal 2 again recently.  I never played the co-op portion so I've been doing that with a friend.  Portal and Portal 2 are easily some of my favorite games of all time.
childfree,fgf018z,t1_fge6ysc,1580717261.0,"I have family friends who have a child that has behavioral problems.  The kid comes from honestly the best damn house a kid with their problems could.  The parents have the resources to get their kid counseling, treatment, and even sent to a special summer camp for kids with learning disabilities and behavioral problems.  

I am going to call this child Y.

Y has threatened school shootings before.  Y has thrown scissors at a teacher. Y has slapped babies just to watch them cry. Things Y has never done: premeditated harming someone or something.  All of these incidents were on impulse. 

Y has impulse control problems which their parents have been working on since day one.  Y understands what they are doing is wrong and wants to make a change but they cannot always control themselves.

After the shooting threat Y was almost expelled.  The only thing that stopped it from happening was when Y's parents flat out said they don't own ANY firearms or weapons in the household (which they do not, and they do not ever plan on having).  They also are upfront with the parents of Y's friends and state they are not comfortable with Y going over to the house to play if there are firearms there.  The friends are welcome to come to their house to play.  Y lost a lot of privileges after that incident and knows if they do it again they WILL be expelled. 

It also infuriates me when kids with problems are just passed over.  It is BECAUSE of the therapy and help Y has gotten that they are better able to control themselves.  Y hasn't hit anyone other than a schoolmate who was the instigator in years.  Y now has coping skills that they try to use when overwhelmed, it doesn't always work but they are sure as fuck trying.  Y has even reached the point they can recognize when they are having a meltdown and express that they need cool-down time.  This is 10 minutes where they can fidget with a small toy, draw quietly, or read a book.  Sometimes Y will just scream into a pillow for part of those 10 minutes if they are at home and it has been a particularly stressful day.  This is a MASSIVE improvement over the previous behaviors of lashing out blindly.

If early intervention hadn't happened I wouldn't be surprised if Y grew up to be a danger to themselves and others.  I doubt Y would be able to participate in school or interact with other children in healthy ways."

LateStageCapitalism,fgeyes4,t1_fge9o9q,1580715101.0,This isn't the pain Olympics.  We are all being fucked sideways by pharmaceutical companies using our lives to fuel their greed.  That is absolutely abhorrent that medication you need to survive is so expensive and I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
LateStageCapitalism,fgeybi2,t1_fgenrbt,1580714983.0,"The problem is companies are tweaking old versions, claiming they're ""new"", and removing the originals from market.  This enables them to raise prices in perpetuity."
LateStageCapitalism,fgey9qy,t1_fgecmzf,1580714920.0,"My dad, who should be retiring, is literally starting up a small business so I can have a job and health insurance.  It is fucking absurd.  I have a chronic injury and haven't been able to find an employer who would work with me."
LateStageCapitalism,fgey4wu,t1_fgedfq8,1580714746.0,"Yup.  Not to mention how incredibly hard it is to get into the system to start with.  The number of people who are ""not disabled enough"" to qualify, yet who cannot hold down regular work because of their disability, is unacceptable."
LateStageCapitalism,fgey3fi,t1_fgeaxd6,1580714694.0,"Yes. My grandfather is on a thyroid medication that is vital.  It costs over $700/month without insurance because it doesn't have a generic and they company can charge whatever they want.  In Canada the same medication is $90/month. 

The antidepressant I need to function is $287.29/month without insurance at the least expensive retailer.  I have tried all the other more affordable options and had very bad reactions to them.  I hate it because the one I was on previously (until I started having problems) was only $17/month without insurance.

At least the other medication I need to function (treatment for my ADHD) actually DID get a generic and is now only $35/month.  Before the recent price drop it was $170/month WITH insurance.

Those two medications aren't price gouged nearly as badly since people won't literally die without taking them.  The more vital a medication is to living, the more likely it is to be price gouged."

I know the husband, Ed, did the landscaping and took care of the roses.

childfree,ffsefb3,t1_ffs7p82,1580179707.0,The problem is when you're a kid stuck at these things.  Now I do totally get drunk while waiting for the wedding party to arrive.
childfree,ffs7t5e,t1_ffqnq87,1580175259.0,"Ding ding ding! I didnt mind the ceremonies since around here they aren't incredibly long. But I *hated* (and still do) waiting an hour for the wedding party to get their butts to the reception.  I was always bored to death at receptions.   There weren't even any kids my age in the family since I was the youngest (8 year difference with first cousins, 17 year different with second cousins)."
childfree,ffs7kxt,t1_ffqxtu4,1580175100.0,Or it's at the expense of the bored out of their minds kids. I didnt mind the ceremony but man I hated wedding receptions. Especially since in the midwest we have this stupid tradition of the wedding party going and faffing about for an hour and THEN going to the reception. So the guests just have to wait for them to get there.
childfree,ffs7c0a,t3_euoct1,1580174920.0,"Bored, unsupervised children ruined my mom's best friend's wedding dress (they spilled crap on the floor and the train got destroyed).  Screaming babies ruined a cousin's wedding recording.  Another cousin had to pay hundreds of dollars for damage to the venue by a group of destructive and unruly brats.  *I* was bored out of my mind at wedding receptions and just wanted to go home as a kid. 

You are NOT a bridezilla for wanting to enjoy your wedding day.  You are NOT rude, callous, cruel, or unkind for wanting an adults only event.  All that matters is that you stated this on the invitation in advance."
childfree,ffs6urd,t1_ffr6q33,1580174586.0,"I use it for when I get a bad cold or my health issues act up since I dont have much control over those. But I agree, when people use it as a blanket copout there's a problem."
childfree,ffs1l0z,t3_eus5n5,1580170902.0,"Yup. At this point I am pretty much antinatalist.  You cant consent to be born. A parent cant guarantee a child won't suffer immensely in life.

The fact I know I do not want children was the start. Not wanting to pass on genetic problems was the first nail in the coffin. The fact that having fewer (or no) children is the best thing I can do for the environment was the final part. 

Then I did some soul searching and realized it is morally wrong (in my opinion) to bring a child into the world when I know they will suffer."
news,ffrxny7,t1_ffqjcd7,1580168236.0,Yeah. The biggest problem for me is I am autistic and have ADHD along with a sleep disorder and seasonal affective disorder.  Literally everything they tell you is a symptom of a TBI is something I already have to deal with.  So I didn't even realize I was affected until almost a year later when I started to recover.  How the hell is someone suppose to even notice the difference?
Symphogear,ffn2yig,t1_ffmsv5r,1580061462.0,Also weren't they on a pretty tight budget too? Making a show with so much original music plus fight choreography cant be cheap.
todayilearned,ffn2mm0,t3_eu5wt2,1580061339.0,I fucking hate open concept offices.  Cubes suck but if they're decently tall its not too awful.  The problem with both is you need to be mindful of how much noise you make. One asshole raises the volume for the whole space like a domino effect.
news,ffn0juc,t1_ffjmsfi,1580060719.0,That would be interesting but the difficulty is pain is so subjective.  Something that registers as a 3 for me could be a 6 for someone else (on a scale of 1-10).
news,ffjldup,t1_ffh4qqy,1580000910.0,Awesome on you getting sober.  It is hard but you've got this.
news,ffjl9ep,t1_ffg8ulv,1580000825.0,"I am INCREIDIBLY lucky my TBI issues are almost entirely resolved. Not 100%, but I can actually focus again. I didn't even realize how much it was messing with me until after I recovered.  I still experience sleep issues and have a very hard time waking up in the morning."
news,ffjkt99,t1_ffi5d9j,1580000516.0,Laundry sinks seem to be much less common than they used to be in general. My house doesnt have one and it easnt flipped. It just never had one somehow?  A laundry sink is on my list of things I need to add. At least there's a bathtub.

news,ffjkaya,t1_ffi11vx,1580000172.0,"Gonna be honest here: acupuncture has helped me with some chronic pain issues.  But that could be the placebo effect.  Also I have it done in a sterile, licensed clinic here in the states."

news,ffjjhaz,t1_ffi5wk9,1579999620.0,"I had to have jaw surgery in 2012 due to literally being unable to open my mouth from severe TMJ. The procedure that would fix the issue had been underwritten out of the policy as ""cosmetic"". Yes. I would totally have my jaw broken in four places, the nerves to my upper jaw severed, and my jaw wired shut just because I wanted to look pretty. Fuck that shit."
news,ffjhjlw,t1_ffimtbt,1579998368.0,Idk. Depends which part of Nebraska.  If they're out west they are fine.  If they are in the southeast there is always a possibility of an international student having brought it back with them (UNL in Lincoln NE has a decently sized chinese student population).
