mentalhealth,fexayjt,t3_eqt9he,1579427913.0,"It does sound like intrusive thoughts, I would definitely lay off porn for a bit, figure out what you're doing when you have these thoughts (are you stressed, bored ect.) And seek counseling because they're clearly causing discomfort. For what it's worth, I don't think you're a pedophile, and there's nothing wrong with liking petite women."

birthcontrol,feijy6x,t3_epbm6v,1579140271.0,"I had to take plan B and honestly the side effects weren't really an issue, only occasional discomfort and that was very brief and honestly I think it had a lot to do with me being paranoid and excepting the side effects. Take plan B as soon as possible, because the sooner you take it, the more effective it is."

mentalhealth,feid2vk,t3_ep9qqe,1579135682.0,"I can totally relate, it took me over 10 long years without any friends to finally make a few. Almost all of them are long distance, and/or rarely message or talk to me. My bestfriend only like like 7 minutes away but I haven't heard from her in months. People that I thought were my friends have stopped talking to me and distance themselves from me. I've also been used by others claiming to be friends. I have so very few people now... this is the main reason I'm not going to allow others to have an eulogy for me. Why, so they bullshit their way through meaningless crap to make themselves feel better?"

mentalillness,fdn5s0p,t3_em3kle,1578578068.0,"Your dad sounds extremely closed minded. You're not alone OP, there are millions of people who have to take medication everyday for A.D.D, there's no shame in it. Your dad is going to believe what he wants but that shouldn't stop you from taking care of yourself. I grew up with siblings who have A.D.D and saw them before and after they were able to take their medication and it honestly does help! I highly recommend looking into A.D.D for yourself if you're still doubting"

mentalillness,fdgsljq,t3_el9tf4,1578407258.0,"I am diagnosed with a depressive disorder and severe anxiety. When my mental health starts spiraling into depression, I have a playlist,  it starts with sadder songs that tend to match my mood and it gets more up lighting with each song. Most of the time it helps. Another thing I do is watch a playlist of videos that have made me laugh in the past. It helps me forget my depression at least for a little bit, and it always makes me laugh, so even if I'm still depressed I've at least gotten a good laugh."

It would be be weird for us to have it two different rooms, I would miss getting to spend time with him."
