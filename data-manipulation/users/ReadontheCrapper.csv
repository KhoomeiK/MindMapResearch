Reminds me of a ‘crazy’ customer we dealt with years ago. Early 2000’s. Supervisor for a call center that handles Landline service issues, so we’re used to dealing with nuts. Heck, we had official verbiage advising people to stand on rubber backed bath mats if they were worried about being electrocuted whilst using their phone. 

Frequent caller said that her neighbors had tapped her phone and were listening to her calls. Cue eye rolls at every report, we’d send a truck and, of course, nothing is found. She kept reporting, saying when her phone rings she can hear theirs ring too, they know about conversations she’s had, etc. A call finally gets escalated to me because she really wants another truck sent out, but the rep refused because we’d already dispatched a number of times. 

She tells me that every time we dispatch, two trucks come out at different times, and nothing is found. Crying. So I call a tech supervisor I have a good rapport with and tell him the story, not really believing her but just looking for a way to make her feel better and stop calling. He questions the ‘2 trucks’ thing and dispatches one more time for a specific time window. 

She has my direct number now and calls before the window to say a truck is there and a guy is on the pole. Call my dude, no truck was supposed to be there then. Wah?!?!?!

Wait a few days, she calls and says the truck and guy are back. Nobody should be there now. Call my guy and he rolls an unscheduled check the next morning 

Tech finds that - yeah the drop has been split and her neighbors were on her line too. Commence Everyone Freaking Out!  

Tech fixes it, I call and tell her, she says she’s calling the police and her lawyer. Apparently she’d testified against some bad people and was still getting harassed about it. Ended up calling me a few weeks later to say thanks, that she was moving again and probably changing her name. Never heard from her again, hope she’s doing ok.

AskReddit,fcn6joa,t1_fcmifvc,1577804581.0,"I tried making fudge this way so many times and it always came out as syrup. Better than Hershey’s (no  Ghirardelli back then) so when my dad ran out he’d always ask me to try to make fudge again. He’d literally say that - I’m out of syrup, why don’t you make a batch of fudge?

Edit: grudge to fudge. Lol"

I have no f**king idea how she did it and I watched so many times. So many amazing meals lost for lack of a recipe. Sigh. I miss my Nana."
