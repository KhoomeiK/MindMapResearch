WritingPrompts,fcqujzb,t3_eif3w3,1577892418.0,"I rubbed the corner of my forhead, where my horns had been. I had liked them. Payed hundreds of gold to have a nice elvish lady carve patterns of them. Real gold. Something I'd probably never see in such quantities again. I can almost feel my tail swishing in annoyance at the thought. 

After that wizard had kidnapped me and a few friends Ayva and myself had decided to make his world our home.

Dungeons and dragons was never my favorite system, but it seemed to be the bases of the world I was in. One thing it lacked was a system for the trauma of adventuring. After 20 years there we were put back here. Neither of us chose it, and now, neither of us could sleep at night, and had no one to talk to about it besides each other. 

And then a sentence ripped me from my thoughts. ""The tiefling woman introduces herself as Guinivere, and gives you the name of her companion, Scarlet."" I choke and panic a little. My name for tiefling, with a companion with the same name as my wife? It was just coincidence. It had to be. But now I was intent on the game. The lady running it did bear a striking resemblance to Scarlett. As she talked and wove her story the coincidences kept adding up until I was in the bathroom crying and having a panic attack. 

She was so far, I needed her, I needed her here by my side, to tell me it's okay. I messaged ayva. Too early for her, but I hoped and prayed she'd be on the other end. 

Knock knock.

""Guin honey, you okay? I didn't mean to upset you."" Her voice. She waited for my response but it didn't come. ""I've come a long way to find you. Come out when you're ready. You look cute as a human too btw.""

AskReddit,fc5lklg,t3_ega9qc,1577460829.0,"I don't go to the gym, but occasionally I get into running. Of course everyone knows you need to stretch before hand to prevent injury, and are probably aware that stretching after aids in preventing next day soreness, but did you also know you need to strength train? Twice a week you should be strength training your core and lower body. I'd also recommend some light upper body training to help maintain good posture. Keeping your chest open helps breathing. The excersices will help you maintain good form, and the big one, prevent injury. I used to get runners knee till I started working out my legs. Afterwards that pretty much stopped. 

Also, try to eat healthy. Your body needs a certain amount of potassium and sodium, as well as protein to heal and recharge the muscles."
