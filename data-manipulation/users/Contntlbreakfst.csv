college,ff6xflg,t3_eryxub,1579636874.0,"Hello me. I was so bad in high school/early college that I couldn't even enter a room without feeling like I was going to vomit/pass out. Nothing doctors could prescribe helped at all and I ended up having to drop out of high school and complete it online before going back to college. It took me 8 years to graduate college and every semester was some sort of new fresh hell for me. There are a few tips and tricks I used to get me through it though that I'll share.   


1. This is probably something you're already doing but scout out the seat closest to the door on the first day of every class. Knowing that you can just quietly get up and leave without bothering the class if you start feeling sick or overwhelmed takes a lot of the claustrophobia pressure off your shoulders. 
2. Plan AHEAD for presentations. Not just the content but everything down to where you'll stand and what you're going to eat on the day of. Always go first if you have the option, if you get it over with the second you walk in, you won't have time to be psyching yourself out once you've already shown up. I choose to do it on an empty stomach (I feel like I'm going to puke. If I don't eat, I know I can't puke so it's easier to ignore those feelings.)
3. If your anxiety is really bad, let your professors know you have a chronic health problem. You don't have to go into detail at all, but it'll help you out. I found that in classes where I told the professor beforehand that I may need to step out of class occasionally, and they said that was totally fine, I almost NEVER actually did it. I used to obsessively watch the clock thinking 'okay I just need to hold on for 38 more minutes then I can leave the room'. Getting the okay to leave when I need to has totally changed that; I stopped being stressed about it knowing that if I felt sick or claustrophobic I could just get some air and then come back and it's not a big deal, and I became a lot more comfortable in those classrooms. 
4. Your life will not end if you miss a presentation. I do not in any way recommend intentionally skipping them because you will need presentation skills in most jobs, unfortunately, and you should learn them as early as you can. It's much more humiliating to bomb a talk in front of a new boss and coworkers than a room of college students. However, if you're an overall good student, in most cases missing one presentation in a class won't bomb your grade. I missed a final presentation once and still made it out of the class with a B-. Life goes on. 
5. Use the health services that your college makes available to you. Counseling is definitely offered which may help a lot if your barriers are mostly mental. If you have an underlying condition that makes your anxiety worse than you should see a doctor about it and use disability accommodations. I mostly toughed it out because I don't like medicine and it historically hasn't worked for me, but my doctor at the clinic that served a lot of students gave me a trial prescription of xanax to get me through the last round of presentations before graduation. Some people can conquer anxiety with therapy and practice, but for others there's a physical component that can't be fixed without medicine."
college,ff6qh5k,t3_eryvyv,1579632751.0,"Keep in mind that you can't have a minor without a major, so if you end up completing your degree at a different school, the minor(s worth of credits) you're currently working towards may not be accepted. 

Unless you for sure know that you would be completing your degree at this school or any other schools will take all of your minor credits, it is not saving you any time or money to satisfy the minor requirements at this school. 

I left a state school to go figure myself out, and went to a community college before transferring back to a different university to finish my degree and I don't regret it at all. I am much happier having done all that than if I would have continued with the program I started in."
college,ff6jdvb,t1_ff6inup,1579628461.0,That's pretty common for professors to drop the lowest assignment or quiz.
college,ff6ihbm,t1_ff6gpjt,1579627909.0,"If you haven't been graded on the assignment yet, but know you got a zero on it you can calculate your current grade like this:

(current grade in decimals) x (1- weight of assignment in decimals))

So if that particular assignment were 13% of the \*whole\* grade (like a final project or something), if you had a perfect A (100%) in the class up to that point and got the 0 it would drop you to an 87%

A 90% would drop to a 78.3%, an 80% would drop to a 69.6%, etc.

&#x200B;

I'll often set up a spreadsheet that does the math for me, and allows me to test possible future grades/test scores. It's nice to know how much leeway you have, like for example if you have a B in a class and the finals are coming up, you can plug in the percentage weight of the exam and it'll tell you the minimum grade you need on it to maintain your current grade (B) or what you'd need to get on the exam to push it up to the next grade point (and if that's even realistic). This isn't as useful for classes that show you your grades as you go but for ones where grades are locked until the end of the semester it really helps you keep an accurate perspective of where you're at at any given time."

Maybe try attending some student clubs that aren’t affiliated with a sorority/fraternity.

They’re definitely designed to be tricky a lot of the time. 

I suggest quizlet flash card sets for studying for the multiple choice. You can find sets for most commonly used textbooks and they really, really help especially with getting familiar with the phrasing of the questions and how to logically think through a multiple choice question format."

For these that may be specific to to institution there will be some sort of public board (probably a website) or mass email sent out to tell you about them. 

You can also just straight up call your financial aid office at the school and ask about scholarships. They can tell you ones you may qualify for and help you apply.

The test isn’t invasive, it just involves wires taped to your head, chest, and legs, and during the overnight portion a chest strap and one of those nose tubes (that doesn’t actually go inside your nose more than a few millimeters) that record your breathing and brainwaves. About half the stuff attached to you during the overnight will be taken off for the daytime portion.

AskMen,fej9nji,t1_fej8hfy,1579162997.0,"Some of the people who I’ve told struggled with it because they couldn’t get over the ‘lack of sexual attraction doesn’t mean lack of general attraction (thinking they look nice, wanting to be around them) or lack of love’ mental hurdle. Even if they understand it logically, I think for people which sex is such an intrinsic part of their life experience, it’s hard to emotionally accept that I do love them fully, just in my own different way. A few accused me of lying about loving them because ‘how could I love them if they don’t make me wet?’. (I still don’t even know how to respond to that) 

The idea that love can’t exist without sex is pretty cemented into our culture, and some people just won’t ever get past it. And for some reason sex with platonic love is totally fine for hookup culture but suddenly not cool in long term relationships? Cultural norms don’t always make sense 

Honestly, most of the time it doesn’t work out, but right now I have a phenomenal partner who truly loves me for who I am and the way that I love him back in my own way. I think friendship should be the basis for all relationships and when you’re partner is your best friend at the start, those big hurdles become microscopic so long as you have good communication and check in about each others needs.

If you’re not 21 or want a better option you should ask your doctor about a fast acting anti-anxiety medication like lorazepam or Xanax.

You can get 10 Xanax pills per year (20 doses if you snap them in half which you should) without having to do a psych evaluation, so if you could get through the course without finishing the trial amount it may be a good idea.

When my mom flies domestically she does just do 2-3 short flights and then come home at the end of the day, but When she flies cross country or flies to Europe she usually arranges it so that she has at least a full day of vacation in whatever city she’s in.

And you don’t have to work everyday. You could say, work a trip that goes *to* Paris, then spend a few days off there before working another trip that goes *from* Paris back to where you started, or to somewhere else. 

Also because flights are free, you can go anywhere you want that your airline flies to on your time off, so you aren’t restricted to going places you’re paid to fly to. You could work a flight to Paris and then decide ‘well hell I have 4 days off now, so instead of flying back home for it maybe I’ll go to Berlin for a while’.

It really sucks to only have one friend. I went through that for a while when I moved and hadn’t made friends in the area yet. When I started wanting to do things socially and only knew one person, I wanted them to be available at my beck and call because I had no one else, which is unreasonable. Even though I knew they were busy it didn’t make me feel less lonely. 

I’ve experienced this the other way too where I was the only friend of one my friends, so they wanted my attention all the time (they’d come over for a full day once a week, and once I moved away they wanted to text every day) and as much as I loved them, I don’t think they realized how hard it was to give them that much time and attention with the other things going on in my life. I was constantly rescheduling my things or having to say no to other people so I could give time to them. 

1. recognize the significance of the time they do give to you (After work/school I sometimes only have one hour a day to spend with my boyfriend who I LIVE with, and often go days without having time to actually talk to any of my friends)

2.  make an effort to make more friends so you have options when you want to socialize (which is hard, I know, and takes a lot of time when you’re meeting people naturally. It took me 2-3 years here to feel like I had a group of 3-4 people I would be comfortable doing things with)"

Advice,fdptill,t1_fdpt0jr,1578639875.0,"I would deal with the flies and the box separately. First quickly open the microwave just to close the box. You could get a big bag of ice and quickly shove it in the microwave (make sure it’s relatively watertight so you don’t make a mess) and freeze the loose flies that got out of the box (this basically puts them to sleep). This will also kill any eggs that are in the microwave if it gets cold enough. Then you’ll be able to take out the box and just wipe away any microwave flies with a damp towel. 

It’s especially important to kill the eggs and reduce the number of escapees since you live in the Philippines and they can reproduce so quickly there.

Then dump out the box somewhere outside and away from the house. We used to dig a hole under a designated tree to bury food waste like this. One time we lost some soup in the back of the fridge for a year, I drew the short straw on that one and oh boy."

They can’t expect you to easily produce a professional wedding photography set when you’re a sports photographer. You’re not set up for it. 

Explain to them that the photos will turn out all wrong because you don’t have lenses for portrait or event photography. Tell them how much the lenses you would need would cost, and that you simply can’t afford to buy equipment to shoot one event. 

If they’re still not convinced it wouldn’t hurt to voice concerns that while you’re a photographer, there’s a lot that goes into wedding photography (like the potential for capturing certain candid moments) that you learn to recognize by repeatedly doing wedding photography. You want them to have the best photos they can of their special day and you just don’t specialize in weddings, so you can’t guarantee that you’ll capture those moments as well as someone who specializes in weddings.
