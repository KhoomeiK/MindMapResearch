>Ship them back to the bottling plant to be washed and reused? 


Soft drinks in 250-350 ml glass bottles are still widely available in my place (India). If you want to take them home, you pay a bit extra. If you later drop them to the store, they refund the charge. Even mom n pop stores literally ship multiple crates of those empty glass bottles back to the companies on daily basis. They pick them up themselves while delivering fresh stocks. The problem is that these glass bottles only come in small sizes (below 500ml), and not with resealable caps. As such, people who want to buy larger bottles, has no option other than plastic bottles. If same could be done for 1.5-2l glass bottles (must come with air-tight resealable caps though) we wont need plastics anymore.

I seen beer bottles to be disposed in a similar way in EU. Supermarkets have automated machines (similar to vending machines) where you can drop empty glass beer bottles, they give coins back."

secondlife,ff56i2b,t3_emeycb,1579581623.0,"Hi, I just started playing for 10 days or so, and so far found 1 set up which is (almost) free.

First of all, do not bother with Altamura and e-body free bodies. they are basically demos, and you can customize almost nothing in them. Also clothes fit very poorly on them unless you make part of your body transparent (alpha) so that your body do not poke through the clothes. Also RuthToo and variants are low-poly mesh - they do not look as good as a proper meshbody.

Safybell has a bento mesh head in her land. You have to play the games and collect 30k points to unlock it. The slot machines gives a total of 1.5-2k per day (10 times per day limit). The sploder can be run unlimited times and give 200 per 2-2.5 min, which translates about 5-6k an hour (Tip: do it when you are alone, and nobody else is running it, you get more points that way). If you have grinded anything in a hardcore mmo before, you should probably be able to grind this in 1-3 days max. The head is actually pretty full-featured, and comes with adjustable skin/eyes/ brows/ ears etc. and lots of bento animations. There is an omega script for it (100L$ sperate purchase at the omega store), which should let you do even more stuff with it (I am yet to get it).

The Ocacin standard body is a bento mesh body at only 250L$ and comes with bento animation scripts. The clothing options are a lot less than top brands, but with a bit of looking you should be able to find enough tailor-made (should mention Ocacin in product page) free/almost free clothes for it. Do it by web-->market place-->apparel and search for Ocacin, and then turn on women's apparel, 1-500L$ (there are lots of 0L$ demos in which we are not interested), no demo filter (it mostly dont work, still cant hurt to check it), and price low to high filters. 

Now the problematic things: 

a) The head comes with multiple skin tones and a full body skin applier - which works nice if the body has omega support. But unfortunately the Ocacin body does not support omega. There are other ways for manually matching the head and body skin tones as per the documentations, I am currently experimenting with them. The head comes with a very convenient neckband though, so if you are not overly fussy, you can just snap the body and the head as use them as it is.

b) You would be needing 350L$+. You have two options for this: easy way - buy it, it costs peanuts. F2p option: grind it at the L$ sploders. I went f2p and grinded the required money in about 2 days. Weekends are great for this since lots of clubs run 1kL$+ sploders at late night with 30-40 people. So 10-20$ per run (15-20 min idling) is guaranteed and with a bit of luck, you can even score 80-100L$ in one run. You can track running sploders by voodoo network. Be considerate though, lots of people equates to lots of lag, so if possible use a basic avatar with no AO. Also dont run around/ push people/ click stuffs unnecessarily, otherwise they might ban you."
