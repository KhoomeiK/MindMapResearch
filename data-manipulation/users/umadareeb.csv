DebateReligion,ffq65ff,t1_fflu510,1580122592.0,">The conclusion isn't baseless, the premise is in the sentence you responded to. 

It is baseless. There's no reason to assume that God find one thing more important than another based on size. He created both, and is independent of physical size. It's as arbitrary as saying that God would consider a part of the universe with more hydrogen more important than a part with less, since both are properties of the universe that God created. Then we have moral agency, which plays heavily into every theistic religion's overarching themes. 

>Your sentence didn't make sense, and being butthurt doesn't make that any less true. If you felt otherwise, you could have elucidated, but not doing so is a tacit admission I was right. 

I can't elucidate when you didn't say what you did or you didn't understand. If you didn't understand terms I used, then I would be happy to define them. If wanted me to reframe it, I would have reframed it. You didn't do any of that. Saying that my sentence didn't make sense and leaving it at that is entirely unproductive. I could do the same thing to any of your sentences and then call you butthurt if you call that unreasonable. 

>I'm not disputing any definitions of the term God. You're not making sense. 

I'm glad you have realized how absurd it would be to do in this discussion, but you did. I mentioned the classical conception of God, and stated that it is what theists agree upon, and you replied with ""That doesn't matter, since what some theists agree upon is literally what this sub was created to debate."" If you weren't disputing definitions, that entire line of conversation never would happened. Go back and read it. 

>The word insignificant doesn't merely mean physically small, I've literally written it's definition, but since this is about relative insignificance, yes piece of the universe could be insignificant to the universe. That doesn't make insignificant meaningless, it merely states the vastness of the sum totality of the universe. 

That is my point. That relative insignificance is not a objective standard. If you want to at least attempt to find a objective standard of significance, then you need a standard that doesn't make every thing except for the sum totality of the universe insignificant.  To put this in clear terms, if we are defining insignificant as ""too small to be important,"" then I am disputing that the Earth is small, and I am also disputing the unstated assumption that size and importance are correlated in this context. 

>I literally said nothing's axiomatic unless agreed upon given the context of the debate. 

And we didn't agree on a conception of God. You were the one who contested it initially. 

>The scope of God's consciousness and power is something agreed upon in a debate about humanity's significance to God in light of that fact. Your response was an outright lie. 

So can we agree that we are talking about an Abrahamic God here? I'm glad you are doing this here, but keep it consistent; don't protest an explanation for questions raised by you or OP as not satisfactory because they come from a religious text. If you agree that we are talking about an Abrahamic God here, then that is completely legitimate but earlier you seem to have been against that. 

>Intuition about relative sizes doesn't mean any more than guesswork just because you get lucky enough to be correct. Your assertion only means something now that you have evidence, which your lazy ass could have done originally. 

I'm starting to think you don't even fully read what I said. I never claimed my intuition was more than guesswork. Nor did I claim my assertion meant something, or that other people should accept my belief. I made no epistemological claim about my intuition. You quoted what I said, so you can see that for yourself. Nobody has the time to do something as tedious as provide evidence for every single thing they say, especially when they never claimed they had evidence for it. It was your mistake to look at what I said and take it as a actual point. 

>Of course, those relative sizes are still irrelevant, so your spinning your wheels trying and failing to make a stupid point. 

No, they are extremely relevant. OP thinks that humans and the Earth are small. What really is small is the Planck length. We are more medium. 

>That was merely an example that demonstrates what likelihood means. The expectation of likelihood increases when enough chances are given for an event to occur. Saying one in a million accounts for variables, otherwise one in million wouldn't be the ratio. If you had any real life example, which would factor variables, you would consider an event a one in a million chance likely to occur with a million chances. 

That's all well and good, but I still don't know where you are getting your numbers from and whether it is even possible to calculate the likelihood of life existing in unexplored or explored parts of the universe. And yes, I do know that these numbers are an example, but you used these examples to prove your point, so it's fair to ask where you are getting them from. 

>This whole debate contains terms not agreed upon. Insignificant has a clear dictionary definition that I was reasonable in assuming you know, and now that you do, quit your bitching. 

I know the dictionary definition. I also know that this discussion contains terms not agreed upon. That is a unavoidable problem in any discussion with human language. Nevertheless, the important terms should be defined as accurately as possible. We don't want us talking past each other and using different definitions, even if they are slightly different.

>It is your fault that your writing skills aren't up to par. Try harder next time.

Everything I said in that sentence made perfect sense. If it didn't, you could ask me what it was I meant by specific terms and I could explain it to you. Calling it incoherent when it's grammatically correct and using English words either means you lack reading comprehension or you don't want to engage with what I am saying. 

>That doesn't matter, since what some theists agree upon is literally what this sub was created to debate. None of that should be taken as axiomatic unless otherwise agreed upon for the context of particular debates.

Ok, so when you say ""would be insignificant to God,"" what are you talking about? The classical conception of God? A theistic one? A deistic one? A Abrahamic one? You can't come to conclusions to God and then dispute definitions of the term by saying ""this is what this sub was created to debate.""

>Maybe get your reading comp up to par. Or don't be so snide about problems you clearly have but think you observe in others.

There's a huge difference between me not understanding what you said here and what you did. It seemed to me that the term you used made no sense in that sentence, so I asked you what you meant by it and whether you meant to use another term. That's not what you did, you just refused to engage. 

>You merely need to compare the earth to the universe in its sum totality to understand it's insignificant.

You are free to do that, but if ""insignificant"" here means physically small, then the word small can be applied to every single thing in existence except for the sum totality of the entire universe. It loses all meaning. We could also compare the Earth to other stuff in the universe to determine the scale of the Earth and whether we are extremely small compared to other things in the universe or extremely large. That's a completely arbitrary standard you have set up. 

>Considering gods consciousness and power expanded as far as the entire universe and beyond, it follows that what's insignificant to it is every bit as significant to him. 

How are you assuming these things? I thought you weren't holding anything about God to be axiomatic?

Just a bunch of baseless assumptions that some follow. I don't think you are understanding the point of the post.

Sure, that doesn't conflict with what I said at all. Either way works. 

>One in a million chance seems unlikely, but if you have a million chances, that something happening once is likely. And the universe is vast enough and old enough that life can arise in it, hence why we're here. 

But that's not the ratio. And that's not accounting for all the variables either. If certain things didn't happen, life wouldn't exist, but then there is the probability of the conditions happening for those crossroads to even be there in the first place. I still don't understand how you would even go about measuring the probability of life arising in a vast and old universe. Are you assessing conditions within the universe we have already explored, or outside of that scope? Both ways don't help your case.

>Insignificant means too small to be of any importance. Excuse me for being charitable enough to think you're smart enough to realize something that obvious in the context of a discussion of an insignificant objects importance to God. 

And I was being charitable enough that I thought you would know how important defining your terms is in discussions like these. We can work with your definition here, though you would have to prove that physical size and importance have something to do with each other. 

>Again, I was operating under the assumption you understood what a common word means or had access to a dictionary. 

I know the dictionary definition. The term itself, while having a set definition, is still subjective in different contexts. That's why defining it is necessary. 

>And if you didn't have an understanding of the definition of the term, you couldn't have mounted a counterargument, since you wouldn't understand what you're arguing against, so you can drop the pretense that I haven't met any requirements for asserting my point. 

No, I just think our discussion can proceed further once we accurately define our terms. I've found that when discussions get to a certain point, it helps to do this so that we actually understand what we are discussing.

You need to prove it's tiny in the universe it is in. And you also need to substantiate the claim that because God transcends the universe he has less reason to care. Do you not understand the concept of a personal God who created the universe intentionally? I didn't prove your point. I brought up God existing outside of the universe to show you how absurd these size comparisons are. Instead of giving a good rebuttal, you changed the goalposts to saying that God being outside the universe means that he has less reason to care, without explaining why.

>What's insignificant to Jeff Bezos, or God for that matter, does not Hinge on what the insignificant thing in question is relative to anything else, so your nonsense contention about atoms to earth and earth to God is just that, nonsense. 

But this just disproves your point. Following that reasoning, we can safely say that what is significant to God (in this case, Earth) does not hinge on how significant Earth is relative to the universe.

Link or quote where I made this claim. 

>You wouldn't need a scientist to say relative significance requires you judge the insignificant object to that which is insignificant to it to determine scale, because any scientist would know that's bullshit. 

Why is that bullshit? I'm asking you to place this significance in context. I'm asking you to define your terms. If you want to accurately portray just how significant Earth is, both of these are necessary unless you don't you want your portrayal to reach a minimum level of intellectual rigor. You aren't talking about relative significance, you are talking about significance in general. I've already accepted that the significance relative to the cosmos is not much. That doesn't mean that on a universal scale, where everything in the universe has to be taken into account, that it is insignificant.

Only if the likelihood that in a vast universe life would arise is greater than how unlikely life arising is in general. How would you even go about measuring that likelihood, when that would require you to make claims about the composition of unexplored regions? Unless you believe that life will or has risen in regions we have explored, but not completely? What is the probability there?

I'm not redefining anything, you just refuse to define your terms! It's a basic axiom of any reasonable discussion. Significance is something that is subjective, as you have pointed out. It varies from person to person. You can't use it in a argument and act as if you proved your point without coherently defining it and explaining why you choose too define it this way in this discussion.

There's a distinction that you are missing repeatedly. I am not contesting that the Earth is insignificant compared to the cosmos (insignificant here being defined as physically small). What you are trying to do is then equivocate this to the Earth being insignificant in general and then claiming that if not, the word loses all meaning. In reality, you are making the word lose most of it's meaning by defining as a term that can only be used when in comparison with the cosmos.

>Religious frameworks can say whatever they'd like about how much God cares, were debating why we should believe them given what we know

I am fine with this framing of the argument. This means that, since we are debating about the consistency of these frameworks given scientific  evidence about the size of the universe, we can use axioms of this framework to prove that this framework remains consistent despite the inclusion of the scientific evidence to the worldview. 

>The whole point is that the earth is insignificant to the master of the universe since it's so insignificant to the greater cosmos. 

The difference in the significance of the cosmos and the Earth that you are referring to here is size. However, God is outside of the universe. Size is not applicable to him. God is not the greater cosmos. He is independent of the universe. Therefore, it doesn't follow that because Earth is physically insignificant to the greater cosmos that it is insignificant to God. 

>Again, if a million dollars means a lot to an average person, that has nothing to do with how significant it is to Jeff Bezos, which is analogous to what we're talking about. 

That's not a valid analogy. Jeff Bezos and the average person are both human beings. Their scale of significance will come from the same things.

That's right. And you wouldn't need a scientist to say that if someone wants to call the Earth physically insignificant, then he should compare it with both things smaller and larger than it, so that he gets a good idea of where it stands. 

>There's nothing vague about the fact that considering life arose on a planet with the right conditions, it could and likely did do so on another of the innumerable planets in the universe. 

The problem with this is that life arose on a planet with very specific conditions. These conditions are not likely. In fact, they were very unlikely. And there's also various other variables that you aren't accounting for either. 

>I never said we aren't moral agents, I challenges you to demonstrate why that matters. I said it's debatable, and it is, but that's an aside.

I haven't claimed that once, but that's not a cop out. It is a very common tenet, especially in Abrahamic religions, that humans cannot fathom the full extent of God because of our finite minds. We can understand some things and reasonably believe other things, but a full understanding is impossible to achieve.

I am not denying that the Earth is insignificant to the cosmos. But does that fact mean that the Earth is insignificant in general? No. In general, Earth is not insignificant because most things we compare against it in daily life are much tinier, but if we change our general framework to that of the universe, then the Earth is not that big anymore but that doesn't mean it is ""insignificant."" It could be in between, or ""below average,"" whatever these terms mean on a universal scale. You have to define you terms.

And this is coming from a person who is calling me pretentious. Do you realise how arrogant you sound? My answer isn't bad, everybody has intuitions. Your question bad. You asked me what I was basing something I said on, and what I said made no epistemological claims. I told you the truth, and then you told me not to mention it, and now you are telling me the answe was a bad one. It was definetly your question that was unreasonable. 

>No, I know it's a good argument for it, and you clearly do too, since ""that's not true,"" is your only retort. Precedent is a strong indicator of the likelihood of future facts. 

So you think that the likelihood of life is a good argument for extra-terrestial life? Sure. Let's examine your argument a little bit more. Are we talking about life that previously existed but doesn't now, life that exists or life that will exist? Precedent makes no coherent sense here. It's far to vague to be applied. Life existing on Earth wasn't even a likely outcome if you look at the probabilities.  

>So what if we're moral agents? To what degree were actually agents is debatable, and animals of all kinds can reason, but putting that aside for a moment, were still further beneath the power and significance of a god than a termite is to a human, so why care?

If you don't believe that we are moral agents, this conversation is pointless. Not only will we not have common ground, but the entire point of this conversation is to discuss the consistency of religion within a religious framework given evidence about the size of the universe. As to the point about the difference in power, you must define your terms. God is much more powerful than a human than a human is to a termite. Humans are also much more moral to God then termites are to humans. In the cases of termites, they aren't even moral at all because they aren't moral agents. The other point that you didn't account for properly is that these comparisons are assuming equivalencies between God and humans. God has a greater capacity to care for humans than humans do for anything, even other humans.

If there are things much smaller than us, and things much bigger than us, than we aren't small. That's how something being smaller makes us less small. Because being small is relative. Say we found a previously unknown, isolated group of humans who are extremely small. As a consequence of that, the average height for humans would decrease (if in this hypothetical there is a substantial enough number to do that). That means that people who were previously considered small could now be considered average. They have become less small.

Yes, I know. I'm just explaining the point to you since you seem to have misunderstood it. 

>You can compare earth to smaller things, but those comparisons don't matter. The Earth is larger than an atom. So what? Here on Earth is supposedly everything God cares about, which is a strange thought considering how insignificant the earth is.

We don't know whether it is everything God cares about, but that's a different topic. We simply know he cares. These comparisons do matter, because you are calling the Earth insignificant. So the questions that needs to be asked is what is the Earth insignificant in comparison too? God? The  universe? If it's with God then that is a nonsensical comparison, and if it's with the universe you have to account for the other comparisons I mentioned. 

>That an electron is insignificant in scale to the largest atoms has nothing to do with whether an atom matters to a person, so in the same vein, the scale of earth to atom says nothing about the scale of earth to cosmos and how much God cares. Understand?

How much God cares has nothing to do with anything of this. The physical size of matter doesn't determine what a being outside of the universe cares about more or cares about less. I'm simply contesting the claim that the Earth or that humans are insignificant in size compared to the universe. We are bigger than a lot of things, and smaller than a lot of things. If you want to prove ""insignificance,"" you have to account for that. 

>Your intuition says nothing about the relative scales of various components of the universe, so don't bother mentioning it. 

I made a prediction, and you asked me what it was based on. I answered your question and you tell me not to mention the answer? 

>You don't know that there isn't life elsewhere in the universe. Considering there's life on Earth, and plenty of the elements that support it throughout the universe, so there's a strong argument for the likelihood of life elsewhere throughout the cosmos.

That's a horrible argument for alien life and you know it. But you are right, I don't know and neither do you. We have no idea whether alien life exists or not, so we can only speculate.

>That having been said, even if life only exists on Earth, and the earth is as insignificant as it is, why does the omnipotent master of the universe care anymore than I care about the most insignificant termite?

Because, as I explained in my post earlier, we are conscious. We are moral agents. We can be punished or rewarded for actions we have committed. Animals cannot. Matter cannot. What we are to termites is not what God is to us. We didn't create termites. Termites are not moral agents. And if you are conceding that life only exists on Earth, then why is hard to believe that the only place with life in the universe is the most important? 

>For the same reason I don't think something so beneath me is significant, it strains credulity to imagine something as far beneath the master of the universe like a person on the tiniest speck of dust, or that speck itself, matter to that being.

The universe isn't just everything larger than Earth, it is also everything that is smaller than the Earth. If you are comparing Earth to the universe in terms of its size, then you should place it on a scale of where it falls from the smallest things in the universe to the largest things in the universe, or the rest of the universe besides Earth combined. Earth is very large compared to an atom. It is also very small compared to far off stars. I don't know enough or care enough to do the calculations to find the ratios, but you are free to do so. I'm sure they have been done already, actually.

>You base that on what? 

My intuition. 

>Also, how much consideration for Planck's do people have. If you want to use that as a comparison, it should cause you to think about the likelihood the omnipotent master of the universe is so invested in our tiny speck of dust. 

It's not a good comparison. There are no sentient beings running around at the quantum levels that we are aware of. Nor are humans omniscient or omnipotent. 

>Putting aside what animals are aware of or why that even matters, your question only further raises the point that the vastness of the universe puts a bit of a hole in a core tenet of the Christian faith.

Why it matters is that a place the size of New Zealand which has a hundred people who are conscious is much more significant than billions and trillions of kilometers of empty space and different combinations of matter. None of those combinations of matter have resulted in sentient life, much less consciousness. I'm not sure what tenet in the Christian faith relies on the size of the universe. Could you enlighten me?

But let's get rid of the hypotheticals for a second, because all they are really doing is assessing what our moral intuition is (which is not necessarily what is morally right) to try to reach conclusions about the entire moral spectrum of this subject. This hypothetical doesn't prove much at all; I could believe that I would choose that because that would be my moral intuition, or because I make a distinction between frozen embryos and live embryos, or maybe because I believe that their value does not add up to a child's.

This is because those who comply with the requirements of the boycott have a larger market to sell to - they don't lose customers by joining, but they do lose them by not joining.

This is true, but it ignores a possible variable of counter movements. What it is demonstrating is the effectiveness of the boycotts, but the situation here is obviously different so it can't be compared beyond show how both would affect the market.

No, I said have no issues with targeting American soldiers if they are in your country. It's a basic principle to support the right of people to defend themselves against foreign incursions in their country. Nobody honest can really disagree with that. I said nothing about terrorists. I don't really like to use that term because of how sensationalized and politicized it is. 

>Those kind of ideas, are what get terrorist killed. Just because you may not act on your beliefs, doesnt mean that someone wont consider you a threat to them because your beliefs historically end up targeting and killing innocent people.

But your belief (American exceptionalism) has historically gotten a lot more people killed. Even if you what you say about me is true, then my beliefs are a threat to one nation. Your beliefs are a threat to the entire world. There's a reason why America polls consistently as the biggest threat to world peace internationally, and it isn't because the entire world irrationally dislikes American culture, it's their foreign policy that makes that clear."

I make it clear that I am not against killing American military if they invading a country, since soldiers are valid targets. I am against the killing of innocent civilians everywhere, and I take a very hard stance on it; in fact, a lot harder of a stance than you do since you actually justify the nukes, which means you believe that killing hundreds of thousands civilians can be justified. In that case, even if I was saying that 9/11 was justified, you should have no problem with it. You think something a hundred times worse can be justified.

I think you lack reading comprehension problems. I'm trying to get you to define terms since I don't believe you have a consistent methodology or moral code when examining these issues. I believe you are a nationalist who will take whatever line supports your ideas. You are not against killing people who you define as terrorist; that's the whole point of your comment.

Which means you can't justify Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Are you really this dense?

>America, to my knowledge, has NEVER targeted innocent people. Innocent people get killed in the crossfire yes, that is a sad side effect of war. Doesnt mean they are the targets. 

America, as a general rule, doesn't target civilians but you have countless cases where they know civilians will be killed and they do it anyways. This is actually worse than killing civilians by directly targeting them. Knowingly doing something that will kill these civilians but not caring because their lives mean nothing isn't justified by claiming ""collateral damage.""

>And Im sure you may bring up Japan in WW2. That, was necessary. If you need me to educate you on WW2 let me know.

I don't need to be educated on WW2 by a nationalist who probably hasn't even read his own countries scholarly histories. You'll just repeat to me what I can find out by attending a American elementary school. 

>I think Americans and most of the civilized world agrees on the definition of terrorist. You seem to either intentionally not understand it, or are one of them.

Doesnt matter at all. You need to define terms when you use them in a discussion, or else the discussion becomes useless.

The sanctions target innocent civilians. The cyber attacks don't, but both are still acts of war according to the Pentagon. The US doesn't really care about targeting civilians, but they also don't care about collateral damage.

>You know, the same kind of people who killed thousands of innocent Americans in 2001?

What's your definition of terrorist? If you can call goverment officials terrorists, then I'd be happy to throw US, China, and Russia under the bus along with the terrorists who killed thousands of innocent Americans in 2001.
