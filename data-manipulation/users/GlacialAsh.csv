I'm well prepared for the weather, and don't plan on being more than a half hour walk from my car at any point. Tbh, this is more of a scenic road trip then a true camping trip. It will be an interesting trip, being so out in the open. In Canada, you are generally camping in dense woods so while the weather can be brutal in the shoulder season, you often have a reprieve or at least a little bit of shelter from the trees. 

I'm going from April 26-May 5th, and I know Spring weather can change in an instant. I'll bring lots of bug spray, and wear my bug proof clothes."

They came over to Peterborough because there were not enough options to complete their degree in Durham."
mildlyinteresting,ferjnjx,t1_ferfmlx,1579354745.0,"Yes I do. They're usually formed in extremely cold temperatures, and are caused by small currents rotating the ice as it is formed. The large circle in the back is most likely formed because there is a bend in the river, causing a circular motion of water. This never let's the ice freeze all the way across the river, and because of the constant spin, circles are formed. The small disks are usually formed in a similar way, but because there is no bend to hold them in place as one large disk they are formed individually. The spin is usually caused by changes in water density causing a mini eddy, forcing the ice to rotate in a smaller area. 

This is a pretty rare phenomenon in general, however, in this river I see if pretty often due to the unique shape and the way the waves from the larger river it flows out of come in. I've also seen disks in the larger river, but they never end up being the entire span of the river, mostly just small disks caught in Eddys."

I'm actually still taking one class this semester to check a box for a certification I'm going for, so I've been around campus lately. 

Pros: beautiful campus, the upper year classes are usually small, lots of help (academically or personally) if you need it, you can generally get to know your proffs, lots of labs are extremely hands on. 

Cons: They are letting too many people in and making first year classes unreasonable large, the cafeteria food isn't great, doesn't have great masters programs, no good study spaces with plugs on the east side and barely enough on the west."
PlantBased4ThePlanet,fera9hf,t3_epzw1o,1579351715.0,"I dont follow a strict plant-based diet for specific days a week, but generally I flow a plant based diet unless there are no other options. So, I am mostly plant based, but allow myself to enjoy time out with friends or eat food cooked for me ad a guest with no restrictions. 

I would also say I'm plant based, not vegan, because I choose to wear leather and keep pets.

But as I continue to eat like this, I find myself not having to actively about meat products as much because I just dont want them. It used to be that if I went to a resturant, I would have to force my self into the vegetarian option because I knew it was better, but not because I wanted it. Now, I literally have no desire to order something that's meat based, I would much prefer to have a plant based dish. Meat adds almost nothing to me. 

So I liked this article, because I think if more people simply cut back on meat products, the  they would stop missing them too."

Sure, I wish a  bit more of Geralts personality came through in the show, but I am generally really enjoying the show for what it is so far. 

A show can just not world build and get the same feel as a novel. And as much as we all love the Witcher novels, they are the be all, end all of literary masterpieces. There is no way it can be perfectly adapted into an amazing show. 

I choose to appreciate them seperarly for what they are, and just enjoy the monster-hunting goodness of both."
wiedzmin,femrrc0,t1_feji555,1579267732.0,"I think Yenn being naked kinda added to the ambience of the scene. While it maybe wasn't necessary, I think it kinda added a powerful feel to the whole scene. 

I absolutely agree that they could have shown that the two were friends better. They could have shown this by simply keeping the original plot, that jaskier and Geralt were simply fishing and happened upon the Djin. They could have literally kept the rest of the dialogue, and it would have come off a lot better. I also agree that the orgy scene was a weird choice... like it just doesn't seem like something Yenn would do?"
