They're very happy together, have been dating for 5 or 6 years, and are starting to discuss marriage. That's all that matters really. I fail to see how that's inappropriate"
MyChemicalRomance,ffgg5yc,t1_ffgfyh9,1579905489.0,Good call! I was not that smart... Pretty sure I just kept them paperclipped together and stuffed somewhere in my desk lmao
MyChemicalRomance,ffgfj2i,t3_etdb9j,1579905089.0,So jealous you held onto that! I used to have a collection of tickets that I saved over the years including their black parade tour and projekt revolution but it got lost when moving out of my parents house
Hulu,ffgf7oe,t1_fffy8ny,1579904889.0,"I suggest downloading the speedtest app on your Apple TV to test that it truly is getting a 50mbps connection

When you say ""on demand"", do you mean something included only in the Hulu Live package? Or does this also happen on other seasons of shows that all Hulu memberships provide?"
TheGoodPlace,ffgdo74,t1_fffwzvv,1579903923.0,"Because they were a collosal waste of time otherwise. Many fans, myself included, found them to be rather unlikeable (entertainment-wise, I get that they're not supposed to be great people). 

So, after making us put up with them for several episodes.. it just feels weird to make us spend so much time with them rather than focusing on the main cast for the final season. And then it felt like they rushed a season's worth of material within 10 minutes of this episode which makes it an even bigger headscratcher."

TheGoodPlace,fff7e5h,t1_ffewc1l,1579877586.0,"Im aware of this... How many times do I have to say I understand the message they're portraying? I'm just saying it's up for misinterpretation that could be harmful to younger, suicidal people."
TheGoodPlace,ffef5gs,t1_ffedpgk,1579845669.0,"I think you missed the point of my comment. I realize the show doesn't mean to simply say ""suicide is the answer"". I agree with you. I'm saying the nuance of what they are trying to say can be lost on some people. You don't think rationally when you're in a dark enough place to be on the verge of suicidal thoughts, which is a bit different from just being obtuse. Combine that with being young and impressionable while your brain is still actively developing and it's just a risky message for some. Especially when it's been such a positive show, so parents wouldn't think twice about their kid watching it"
TheGoodPlace,ffebu7y,t1_ffdyk6h,1579842470.0,I agree.
TheGoodPlace,ffebk4i,t1_ffe2rwt,1579842216.0,Because there will be some young people where the nuance will get lost. Some 13 year old struggling with depression to the point of suicidal thoughts may not be thinking rationally and then they're just left with their favorite show telling them that suicide will bring them peace if they want it.
TheGoodPlace,ffebbkn,t1_ffe7axu,1579842001.0,"I understand the message they're giving. But that nuance can get lost to some, and I don't know that ""suicide is the answer to finally bring you peace"" is a great message to show a young teenager struggling with crippling depression, for example."
TheGoodPlace,ffeaj3c,t3_et2p4s,1579841300.0,"So Eleanor puts two seconds of thought into encouraging people to kill themselves? Ehh. 

I get the message the show is trying to portray, but I worry about a young teenager going through a dark time in their lives seeing this and getting the wrong idea"
