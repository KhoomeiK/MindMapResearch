ChildrenFallingOver,ffbtcsx,t3_esh1j7,1579782021.0,"... when I was a little girl my mother's pet Doberman Pinscher used to do something similar. The dog would try to snatch the tennis ball from my hand, gently with her teeth. I'd hold it above my head so she couldn't get it. Then she would grab my pony tail and pull me onto the grass and very annoyingly walk all over my face before laying on my face. I was stubborn and would hold the ball outstretched. The dog would keep her body on my head and reach her front paws and then teeth for the ball. 

It was always such fun. It was the same regime every time. I was heartbroken when she died. Absolutely heart broken. 

I have two small children myself now and I have a beautiful Doberman Pinscher pup who is just 14 weeks old."
piercing,ffb3h35,t1_ff9ygyb,1579750825.0,Thanks we ended up with some cortisone cream. Do you think I should switch her over to 9ct gold?
piercing,ff8vh3k,t1_ff5ofbd,1579697467.0,"Thanks so much! Your advice is wonderful. I have an appointment in 12 hours time with a very good doctor. I'm keeping it under control with the salt water for now. 

Normally I would agree with you, but my daughter is like a little old lady and very reasonable. She never touches them because they've always hurt a little but also I've explained. She knows how infection works because she had appendicitis. When she had gastro, the same surgeon whom operated saw her (the Gastro was two days after operation). She says without a skipping a beat, 'Well. We know it's not my aplendix. You already took that out!'  she was only 5. Haha!! But seriously, little old lady has reminded me every few hours to Salt her ear. 

The earrings she has are intended for healing. Infact she really wanted hello kitty but the lady at the piercing shop advised against those until she's all healed up and to go with the titanium which they recommend for initial piercing. I deliberately went to a place that is just peircinga and nothing else."
CasualConversation,ff5ungj,t3_ernnbu,1579610846.0,"When I was a little girl, there was a man who lived next door to my aunt who had the hots for my mum. He was a lovely old man. He was in the Navy, I believe and had fought in the war (Aussie).  He would have been about 65 at the time and it was about 27 years ago.

I had never seen a tattoo in my life. I was scared of his tattoos. He told me not to be scared of the eagle (he called bird) on his arm because it was his good friend! My eyes widened.   'Sometimes when  I wake up in the morning, there's an egg laying on my pillow! I cook it up and have it for breakfast'. 

I'll never forget that! I was 3 years old."
piercing,ff5n1yg,t1_ff5n05q,1579601118.0,... going to the doctor in 36 hrs. Wondering if there's advice other than what the local phamicist has given. Gee Wizz.
DobermanPinscher,ff5lwea,t1_ff4icus,1579599339.0,"Thank you so much for your reply. I have decided that I will seek out a second opinion for her desexing and will also put her back on the BARF diet which was recommended by the breeder. 
You're so lucky to have found a vet that loves Dobermans. They aren't. Very common breed where I'm from. I've only ever seen one in my neighbourhood in the decade I've lived here."
DobermanPinscher,ff4ffvd,t1_ff36qjm,1579562328.0,"Hi, I'm wondering if I can ask you a few questions about my doberman pup please? 

I had her on a raw diet, raw wet food (mix of vegetables, fruit, minced chicken carcus, fish etc . I was giving her bones. 

Unfortunately she found a bone in the backyard that had been out for 24 hrs in extreme heatwave (Australia!) I managed to get it off her (she was 11 weeks). She became sick with diareah for a day after that. The vet told me to switch her to canned wet food and dry food only with just carrots for her teeth.  I disagree with this in my heart. What's your opinion on raw vs cooked? I think giving her bones which she can finish in one sitting would be a better option? 

Also, the vet wants her desexed before she is 6 months of age whereas the breeder has told me to desex after two cycles. I'd prefer to do it earlier because with two small children I don't want to deal with messy heat as well. I also don't care if the dog grows to full size or not. She's not a show dog, she's a member of the family! 

I hope you can answer these questions because they're bugging me. [Bonnie - 9 weeks old (now 13)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/qhgPsrDR2zbtLYoVA)"

todayilearned,femipvj,t3_epsu7m,1579257621.0,"I feel as though a member of my extended family has this syndrome. The child is 4:
- is overly friendly (will sit on a stranger's knee) 
- has trouble focusing on tasks like dinner without getting into trouble from his parents 
- each hand has siemien crease
- wide set eyes with low nasal bridge 
- loves music , like way more than other kids 
- is short in stature and small frame despite his father and grandfather being tall and large frame 
- is happy go lucky 
- doesn't seem as alert to his surrounding as other kids his age and does not contribute to much conversation - he will ask questions to his parents and grandparents


The parents have not opened up about his condition. I have made assumptions."

I'd rather an animal accidentally kill me than some arsehole decide my time is up. I live on the back of bushland and garden barefoot. I've never encountered a snake because I make lots of noise and stomp around. If I encountered a snake, I'd leave it alone and very slowly back away."
DobermanPinscher,fehy759,t3_ep6yz1,1579126243.0,"I grew up with both breeds. 3 GSDs and 3 Dobermans (all different times). They are both a great breed. Had agression issues with one female Doberman which resulted in a rehome. 

I had a Toy Poodle for ten years. Now I've got two small children of my own and decided to get them a best friend. I had a lot of trouble choosing between GSD and Doberman. 

I went with the Doberman just because I didn't want to deal with the coat of GSD as it's an indoor dog."

TrueOffMyChest,febzy0o,t1_fe8imtw,1578964748.0,"Yea, sugar doesn't cause diabetes at all. Diabetes doesn't cause stroke or heart failure either.  What was I thinking!

Too much sugar in your diet can also cause fatty liver which can also lead to liver failure. 

I'm not saying a few milkshakes or soft drink caused her to die but if she was overweight and eating unhealthy foods as part of her regular diet then yea it's a 'thing'. 

WATER CLENSES your body. 

If you didn't drink anything or eat any food with water in it for 3 days you would die from dehydration."

TrueOffMyChest,fe5agtz,t3_enstex,1578867024.0,"This chick is selfish, immature, disrespectful, toxic and guess what? She doesn't give a hoot about your feelings. She seems to enjoy hurting you and loves that you chase her when she's single. 

If you really want her back then you need to treat her as she has treated you. Tell her you've met someone and don't want to jeopardize your new relationship. Ignore her for exactly one week. Don't respond under any circumstances. 

After a week message her saying oh sorry my new girlfriend took me on a holiday. Watch her die. Then you can say your new girl is going away on work and now you're just in a flirting relationship with her... 

Personally I'd bloody run from that chick. She's a piece of work."
TrueOffMyChest,fe57rd8,t3_ensi4a,1578866345.0,"Suicide is final. There's no going back. 

All the suicidal people I have ever known get better. They meet new people, change jobs (or get a job), find a new hobby, loose weight and become fit, become a pet owner or even have a baby. They go on to live amazing and fullfilling lives. 

Suicide is cruel and selfish because the people left living never get the opportunity to help or see the person recover - when statistically they will if they get help."
