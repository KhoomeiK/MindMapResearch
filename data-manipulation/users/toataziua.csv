Conclusion is: 1% is more than nothing."
MadeMeSmile,fed5arz,t1_fecxz2d,1578999586.0,"Because if you saw the video of her 3 years ago when it appeared online you would've laughed at her, just like everyone else, and then ignore her for the rest of your fucking life. I would totally do the same thing as her if I was in her position: FUCK EVERYONE WHO WASN'T THERE WHEN I WAS DOWN. I even admire her for how she's changed her life, but instead of her being the main subject here you still talk about yourself. Why do you even consider yourself important in HER story?"
getdisciplined,fdpzeyi,t1_fdp7ngi,1578647265.0,"For every productive habit you're trying to implement you have somewhere around 2.5 - 3 months of time. With every habit that you add, the time becomes shorter and shorter as your body and mind get used to being productive."
getdisciplined,fdn9tae,t3_ema2hu,1578581064.0,"Yes it is normal. Your body and mind got used to  a lazy lifestyle and now that you're trying to be productive it's like they are going through a small ""shock"", but the good thing is that as you persevere with the thing you want to do the ""withdrawal"" will become less and less visible and in the end disappear."
europe,fdatuox,t1_fdatezx,1578250078.0,"Are you sure? The same thing about a low tournout was said for the latest elections and it wasnt true. 

And note that USR is just one of the 2 parties. So if USR gets 18% and PLUS gets 5-6% then that's ok for me. You cannot magically change the politics over night."
getdisciplined,fdat405,t3_ekh0j2,1578249771.0,Yes you can. I was able to shift to being an awesome being. What you need to know is that the reverse is also true. You can go from being a disaster to a disciplined being to a disaster again if it gets to your head that you are awesome and dont need anything else.
europe,fdard7t,t1_fdaqzt4,1578249236.0,I totally agree with you.
europe,fdar66o,t1_fdaikid,1578249173.0,"if you mean the ex-governing - PSD party, then yes, they going down."
europe,fdar15p,t3_ekg6kt,1578249128.0,"I dont think any party will get over 40%. This prediction is somewhat wrong because USR+ (this is a coalition between 2 parties, USR and PLUS, not just USR as presented in the picture) will have around 20% and I also think PSD wont have more than 20%."
europe,fd88zk2,t1_fd88ch3,1578215371.0,"If I can learn about remote places I have never been to (like Ethiopia, Niger, Bangladesh and so on) then he can learn about Eastern Europe too. You're just too indifferent to learn anything."
europe,fd7ozsz,t1_fd7olkj,1578207848.0,"Let's not rush to make assumptions. I know people can be proud of the area they come from.. maybe this is the case for him too, but he HAS to specify that Transylvania is in Romania."
europe,fd7koct,t3_ek1jgm,1578205987.0,"Please specify that Transylvania is in Romania. You make it sound like it's a different country and that's weird.

LE: the irony is strong within you, I see that. I'm sorry for trying to say something that is actually correct. I will not try next time. Thanks."
europe,fd7kis4,t1_fd6dmva,1578205920.0,Then this says a lot about you.
