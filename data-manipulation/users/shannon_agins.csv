AskReddit,ffb8hg6,t1_ffac6hc,1579754982.0,"I knew the end of babies r us and toys r us would be in the horizons about 3 - 4 years before closing. That giant clearance blast sale was the last of our really good sales. Right after that, the entire sale structure changed and not for the better. 

I transitioned from babies to toys that season and pricing wise, that was one of the worst I had seen. My area was a good area for the business, busy locations, decent amount of hours for staff, and the store manager flat or refused to have any cashiers, even during season. I was the front end supervisor and I was the only cashier Monday thru Friday. 

The toys r us I was in was a side by side,and there were chunks that looked old, and it really wasn't. The babies r us I was at was a very nice store and was larger than the side by side. The standalone toys r us literally looked like it was falling apart. Somebody set it on fire and outside of the charred shelves, it looked the same. That toys r us is now an Ollie's and it still looks the same. 

I went back to help my BRU out to close, and despite it having been three years, all my vacation time was still in the system from my final season, so I can't complain about that."

We had family members who are in precarious health positions so our main priority was immediate family when we did the ceremony and making sure they were ok."
fatlogic,ff3353m,t1_ff2vx43,1579532459.0,"Same about my endocrinologists specialty being diabetes! she didn't beat around the bush either. 

Honestly, at this point I've done really well eating what I want in moderation and eating actual portion sizes since my diet was pretty balanced between healthy and not healthy foods. Volume was my biggest issue, and it's one that's hard to fight."
fatlogic,fez9lso,t1_fez2w76,1579455069.0,"My endocrinologist was the only doctor who hard core mentioned my weight, but her solution was a nutritionist that wasn't covered by my insurance and I couldn't afford them out of pocket."
ChoosingBeggars,feyws0s,t1_feymjq1,1579451497.0,This was why I just went to the formal section at the department store. Bought an absolutely beautiful dress that was my actual size and was less than $100.
AmItheAsshole,feycea2,t1_fewr3c1,1579443698.0,"We've had two of our cats pass in our arms instead of them going to hide. Both of them only started showing signs they were sick the day before and had vet appointments in the morning, but they refused to leave our sides as they got closer."
iamverysmart,fesrih9,t1_fesmxsv,1579368255.0,"I'm not a big jewelery wearer ether, the only jewelery I wear is my wedding band and engagement ring, both super thin, dainty bands. I physically couldn't move my finger with bands any wider. Downside of your hands not growing since you were nine. 

I got so frustrated when we were ring shopping because with almost everything the band portion was too wide, we found maybe 3 engagement ring options and only one wedding band that really worked for my finger length. 

I love the look of stacked bands, I want to get a few for my right hand but I haven't been able to find ones thin enough and I'm too scared to try Etsy ordering."
iamverysmart,fesmqhd,t1_feslz0f,1579366876.0,"I wear thinner rings because I have short stubby fingers! My hands are literally the size of a child's tho, so it ends up balancing out. 

There is a perk to thin bands, you can stack them to change up the look whenever you want."

fatlogic,feh30ks,t1_fegmp60,1579108090.0,"I think one thing I'm kinda bitter about is that i need to buy new clothes when they get too big to wear without deconstructing them. Darn you professional job. 

On the plus side, that means I've been investing in better quality clothes and still spending less money."
MiddleClassFinance,fedokjo,t3_eomncv,1579016486.0,"We are at about 13% without car payment but including my student loans at this point. About 28% with car. Final student loan cost will be about 20k, car is half paid off, 18k left with interest calculated, and consumer is about 5k. We annually make between 90 - 100k. 

We do not own a home yet so that likely skews numbers, but we are saving. Our biggest expense outside of rent is car insurance because the husband has one fault - his driving sucks."
fatlogic,fdgxat9,t1_fdguop4,1578410610.0,My sister in law gained back 40 pounds in six weeks and I just wanted to cry. I couldn't figure out how she did it and this makes me even sadder to realize the math.
MadeMeSmile,fddtb6n,t1_fdcj9f5,1578323435.0,"Yup, this is what happened to me. I couldn't get financial aid and my credit kept me from qualifying for loans so I was paying on my own my first time around. I fell short my last semester and couldn't make the payments in time. Finally paid it off so I can continue elsewhere."

They do have an official partnership with Budweiser because otherwise monster wouldn't be able to be sold outside of liquor stores in areas that require all products of beer and alcohol companies to be sold in specific locations. Monster was created by Budweiser."
TwoXChromosomes,fckz875,t1_fckfebd,1577736365.0,"It frustrates the hell out of me because at Walmart I could pay $4 for my face wash (before they stopped carrying it), I can TRY giant at $7, or I can go to CVS and pay $8 and know they have it. 

My CVS isn't even marked up much on things like tampons compared to Walmarts prices for them. But walk down that face wash aisle and you get smacked in the face with it."

 I knew I wanted to do something creative but couldn't get my body and mind to work. A friend bright her knitting bag over to the house to work on a baby blanket while we were all hanging out and an obsession was born. 

I just broke a year long lack of crojo and pumped out three throw blankets in a week of working from home."
AskReddit,fcjml1f,t3_ehj6wr,1577694000.0,"I never really came out, just had interests in both boys and girls that was never really talked about, it's just not a big deal in my family. So I didn't even have any weird reactions until I was in my mid 20s. 

The weirdest reaction was a coworker and I talking about our experiences moving south and being LGBT (both of us are bi and polyamorous) and another co-worker yelled out ""I knew it! I knew you were a rug muncher!"" Apparently she was one of the only ones at the store who hadn't caught onto it."

TTC_PCOS,fcgfox9,t3_eh6wm9,1577639458.0,Our parents and friends know. One of our friends even gifted us ttc friendly lube and a few boxes of pregnancy tests for Christmas. It's been easier this way considering we are the last couple who wants kids to have them so it stopped a lot of the questions.
tumblr,fc5fka5,t1_fc57wnh,1577456142.0,"The only thing that gets me about trying to search for knitting and crocheting patterns thru Google is all the damn free pattern websites that just congregate links that for some reason never seem to have the right link or that just link to another of those sites, or a blog post about the pattern. They're worse than Pinterest. 

Can I just get a ravelry link somewhere, please?"

I start back on reducing calories tomorrow, but I am so excited that I can do maintenance. I don't know why, but I was worried about it. 

I have dropped to a 2x shirt and even wearing a fitted 3x shirt it looks like an oversized tunic. Perfect for leggings, not so great for anything else."
fatlogic,fbwhs0w,t1_fbw8644,1577150274.0,I posted there once and some of the comments were super nasty. The mods over there were very quick to remove it. Those comments were exceedingly nasty on that lovely user's post.
