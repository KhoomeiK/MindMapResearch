NoMansSkyTheGame,fff0pug,t1_ffervex,1579872455.0,Hold up....is this really a thing?? How am I STILL learning new shit about this game?? Can we actually build terrain made out of activated indium?? Imagine the possibilities with all the different colors! I dont think I've ever seen a photo where this technique was used. I really hope this is true.
veganrecipes,ff22744,t1_ff20ii4,1579491797.0,Nutritional yeast is like the vegan cheat code. Enhances literally EVERY dish! Chili? Salad? Tofu scramble? Burger? The answer is always yes!
offmychest,femxsx2,t1_fehp1q1,1579272380.0,"Damn man...my brother's name was also Jonathan...and I have also taken his ashes with me to many places, just not in a necklace. My parents, sister and I all have tiny matching urns with some of his ashes and the main urn stays at my mom's house. I have taken him to concerts that he wouldve fucking screamed if he knew these guys were playing together (he was a drummer) 

It's nice to hear that others are going through similar stuff. There are so many times when I feel like no one could ever understand how I feel or what I'm going through. I can't imagine if I shared my birthday with him. That's some next level weirdness of emotions...trying to celebrate your life and at the same time mourning his. I'm so sorry. 

I'm glad to know you exist. Sucks that we are part of such a shitty club, but it really is nice to know the club exists and there are many of us. Much love. I hope you find some peace in all this."
offmychest,fefnfnr,t1_fefb57f,1579060147.0,"Fuck man I know exactly what you mean! Almost feels selfish in a weird way :( but it's not man, we are just trying to cope! How long ago did your brother die? I have been through so many different bouts of feeling like its not fair for me to have fun when my brother isn't around to experience it too:( it's like survivor's guilt. I feel guilty enjoying things when he can't."
offmychest,feezgt0,t1_feezcbs,1579044632.0,Same...its been 8 years for me and I already notice memories fading:( its scary to imagine how much will just be lost to time
offmychest,feez0hy,t3_eojf0n,1579044340.0,"Fuck man... I dont want to add to your already overflowing inbox,  but I want you to know that I also lost my brother and that you may feel alone and like no one could possibly understand what you're experiencing....and while that may be true to a degree, there are so many of us that fully resonated with this post when we read it. It's been 8+ years now since my brother overdosed on heroin and this post immediately took me back to that night. I remember so vividly. And so will you. This moment will undoubtedly alter who you are as a person, but I think it's important not to let it define you. Much love to you and your family. I'm so sorry that this has become part of your reality. You're not alone. You're welcome to PM me anytime if you're feeling crazy or like no one gets it because I promise you I fucking get it. I'm so sorry."
NoMansSkyTheGame,feexokc,t1_feetkx2,1579043476.0,"Bro....welcome home:) we are family here. So many of us play for the same exact reasons. To get lost. To escape. To help cope with reality. This is the perfect game for that. 

Pro tip: turn the music volume all the way down and use Spotify :) even more immersive and catered to your personal style.

Enjoy! If you have any questions check the search bar as we have most likely already talked about it  numerous times :) much love"

What an amazing keepsake from what was probably a very strange and difficult time for her. So lovely. It's like the perfect juxtaposition of pain and beauty. Thank you so much for sharing this."
offmychest,fdk3t6i,t3_eloypz,1578495374.0,"Hey I'm going through something very similar! You're not alone! I'm not going to quit completely, but need to cut back. It has always been either zero alcohol or just keep drinking until I fall asleep....but lately I've been practicing moderation. Just being mindful of it has helped so much. Really nice to read this...I wish you well"
NoMansSkyTheGame,fdbo4pb,t3_ekib9j,1578259363.0,This looks so freaking epic!

pics,fd02a81,t1_fcznfq3,1578112583.0,"I had tickets to see him on April Fools Day!!! There were like 12 of us all furiously texting each other at work trying to figure out if it was real or not! It was insane! That was a day I will never forget. I actually called the number on the back or his CD ""for booking inquiries"" and the guy that answered sounded so fucking sad and just said ""yeah, it's TRUE, I'm sorry"" :("
StayAtHomeDaddit,fcwjjne,t3_ej0thh,1578027347.0,"Yeah shit happens :) we've been talking a lot to my son lately about going to bed early so he can get a good nights rest and be ready to wake up and spend some time with his mom before she goes to work.... and he is like ""dad you NEVER go to sleep when me and momma do."" Touche bro...lol"
nomanshigh,fcwj7xs,t3_ej1f45,1578027085.0,"I highly recommend playing solo with headphones on. And seriously just play. Just do whatever you want. It's an experience with so many options. 

I think my biggest piece of advice would be to remember that there are no time limits on any missions/storylines/etc.. you will see messages pop up in the corner reminding you to do stuff, but you dont really HAVE to if you dont feel like. There are rewards and definitely things to learn from completing stuff like that, but dont let it make you feel like you cant just chill and do what you want. 

To me, that is why i play this game. The freedom to just walk around and gather resources if I feel like it. Shoot off into space and just shoot some asteroids for a while. Build a sweet base or just wander. So much freedom."
Psychonaut,fcofbyg,t3_ei1hcf,1577830865.0,Ignorance really is bliss. That's why so many look to escape and momentarily forget. You're not alone. Much love.
nomanshigh,fcn4usd,t3_ei0poi,1577803312.0,"I really like Cloudkicker's ""Let yourself be huge"" and Aphex Twin's Ambient Tracks volume 2 really has a unique atmospheric alien vibe to it"
