NintendoSwitch,ffbni9v,t1_ffaqwuz,1579774263.0,">But people like you have to make it a censorship issue 

It *is* a censorship issue.  If it weren't, they could use the latest version, and swap out the art assets for the originals and then re- localize the single affected story chapter. 

If censorship had nothing to do with it, then either laziness or money (or both) was the culprit.  Don't talk like it is somehow ""impossible"" to have ported the game the way the fans would have wanted it.  Leaving the censorship in the game wad a deliberate decision,  not just something that they couldn't change."

If they ever do a MG Graze it might come with parts to make a 1st form of Barbatos."

Edit: not that I care about downvotes but I am curious as to why people didn't like my comment.  I wasn't being sarcastic and people might really not know about faster ways.   If you aren't abusing the time skip glitch to earn money,  then you're spending a ton of time EV training,  and if you are abusing the glitch for money then toy might as well do it to save time EV training via pokejobs."

Gunpla,fdows0a,t1_fdovu6t,1578614652.0,I did it with mine and it works well most places. The places you really can't do it is on the knees and the upper part of the shield.
Gunpla,fdotu28,t1_fdoeusr,1578612731.0,"Actually you can get a similar effect with the molotow chrome but you can't do it the same way.

This whole thing is confusing a lot of people,  but the only thing confusing me is why they are confused. 

It's really not hard.   Like every other thing called ""expansion pass"", you get all parts of it as they're released (2 parts in this case), and since there's two different games (sword, and also shield), there's an expansion pass for each one."
pokemon,fdot1ue,t1_fdnl2yg,1578612235.0,Maybe you should watch the direct before spouting off nonsense.
pokemon,fdo1gtv,t1_fdnbf2o,1578597138.0,">How would that work if both games are under one nintendo account?

They're still two separate games. It's no different logistically than buying the expansion pass for Zelda, and the expansion pass for Fire Emblem on the same account."

NintendoSwitch,fcyehkv,t1_fcxevh4,1578078929.0,"I prefer the current way they're doing retro games rather than the old virtual console format.

I, too, want to play the games from previous generations, but rolling them into a cheap ass subscription service instead of selling them piecemeal is far superior."

Hahaha.  HAHAHAHA!

No developer under EA makes anything independently. This is literally the same BS that they say everytime a studio is acquired by EA and it *always* devolves into EA stepping in more and more until the studio is nothing left but the name to bamboozle you into buying.  I learned this way back with Bioware.  Nothing has changed."
