I've seen quite a number of video's of these weapons being used directly against people, and even though it makes a big bang, usually I see more people walk away from it afterwards than one would expect when seeing such an explosion. This would suggest that the primary type of injury is concussive and internal, caused by the shock wave (injuries that often have a slightly delayed impact on the victim, giving them time to stumble away from the scene before collapsing), rather than laceration wounds caused by shrapnel (which would have an much more immediate and immobilizing impact)."

Not sure if that's the case here as well, but if you look at Brazilian favalas like Rocinha (that started out in a similar fashion as OP's photo, and still shares many resemblances), you'll notice that on street-level these area's appear in a better shape than you'd expect when seeing it from above ([streetview example of Rocinha](https://www.google.com/maps/@-22.9892755,-43.2515731,3a,90y,300.18h,88.57t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swqH5v8GGBMaOG_xNOPxmEg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)).
