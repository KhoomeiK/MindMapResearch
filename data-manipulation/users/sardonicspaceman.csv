AmItheAsshole,ffsapqd,t3_eurjt5,1580177246.0,"DO NOT LET HUSBAND/FIL DRIVE YOU TO THE HOSPITAL!!! CALL AN AMBULANCE, CALL A TAXI, CALL YOUR PARENTS OR FRIENDS, BUT DO NOT GET IN THE CAR WITH THEM!!! 

Psycho FIL is going to do everything in his power to make your birth a natural nightmare, and psycho spineless husband is going help him! Do NOT give them an opportunity to leave you stranded!!! 

Please, OP, we are all so worried for you. This is a horribly abusive situation, please understand that you can still get out and save yourself and your baby!"
JustNoSO,ffkne9t,t3_eu2k0b,1580025623.0," I’ve been where you are, and it’s horribly depressing to be betrayed in such a violent way by your SO.  

You are NOT being over dramatic. There is something very wrong with a person who can treat their SO like that, drunk or not— it doesn’t matter. His attempt to downplay what happened and “start fresh” the next morning is just the start of a downhill trip. If you decide to stay (which I completely understand if you do; these things are complicated) be prepared for some major gaslighting and probably more aggression from him. 

You deserve love and compassion, no matter what he leads you to believe. Stay strong."
JustNoSO,ff87dnh,t3_es55rk,1579668105.0,"I’m sorry, she smokes all day? Like, even with your school-aged kid around? 
And I’m going to be that person and say self-diagnosing is toxic and unhelpful. She’s claiming to have PTSD, for Christ’s sake, something you actually have been diagnosed with. I think she’s trying to get you to over-empathize with her to the point of where she doesn’t feel guilty for not even trying. Having a mental illness is awful, and can be debilitating, but it’s not an excuse to abandon and abuse your family; It’s still her responsibility, even if she didn’t ask to be mentally ill. She needs to stop blowing money on weed and get therapy."

I understand your family’s frustration, as son is a minor and that’s probably all they’re considering, but I don’t think you’re an asshole knowing the context."

JUSTNOMIL,ff3jukq,t3_er98j4,1579542585.0,"I think you both owe each other an apology, to be honest. No, she shouldn’t have taken your kids out of state without your permission, but you shouldn’t have banished her from the house and her grand children, either. You’re both facing some of the most painful losses (spouse and child), and neither of you are thinking very clearly. It is not the time to push each other away; You all need to be there for each other, even if you’re (understandably) too angry to see it right now."
AmItheAsshole,ff2ercs,t3_er4rxt,1579503107.0,"Info: How old was daughter when you and dad split? 
Were you and dad kind to each other and daughter during that time? 
Did daughter receive any sort of therapy during that time/now? 

Daughter may legally be an adult now, but I don’t think it’s fair to assume her emotional/decision-making intelligence is up to date if it was stunted earlier by the trauma of a bad divorce."

JustNoSO,felvpgp,t3_eptzkm,1579232116.0,"You deserve better. Take your stuff and go. When he sees that his little ego tantrum (“reclaiming” the house as his own) didn’t devastate you, he’ll fall off that high horse. And he’ll be sorry when his parents take advantage of your absence, but that shouldn’t be your problem anymore. It’s 2020, and no one that matters is going to shame you for leaving an emotionally abusive marriage."

Also, do you really like Amy, or is the longevity of the friendship what keeps you around? Not only is the hinting thing obnoxious, but she claims to not like your other friends. Obviously, not everyone has to like everyone else, but does she really have any legitimate reasons not to like them, or is it just the fact that they take you away from her? She also claims she “doesn’t have anyone to go with”, which is concerning because are you really the only friend she has? I don’t know. Amy just doesn’t sound like a great friend, overall, and you’re completely justified in not wanting her to go."

AskWomen,fdd28qn,t3_egx7on,1578291873.0,"Like many others here, my former BFF just refused to make any effort. I lived 40 minutes away in my college dorm (it was required freshmen stay on campus), no car and no friends there, yet. I told her how lonely it was, and how I’d love to go get dinner with her sometime. Apparently, she “never had time”. But, she could visit her (ex) boyfriend, who lived a neighborhood away from my dorm multiple times a week. One time she even last-minute invited me to a concert just to say “Oh, sorry, you’re out of the way”, after I said yes— in hindsight, she was totally just bragging, not truly inviting. Later on, I moved to be with my husband, states away. I told her she was always welcome at our house, and she should come out in the summer. How did she respond? By telling me she’d much rather spend her money to go to Ireland. But here’s the kicker: after finding out her boyfriend would be visiting his out-of-state friend, she shamelessly asked me if she could come out to see me during that time. Lol, nah, I told her we’d be busy. She never went to Ireland, either lol. Looking back, she never was a very good friend, and pulled shit like this regularly. Anyway, we stopped talking last year (the end of 10+ years together) after I let her have it, and it’s been a blessing."

offmychest,fd32y82,t3_ejual2,1578154301.0,"Don’t you dare take any of the blame from that sick fucker. Rapists are the only cause of rape. You were simply a victim of your body’s reaction to extreme fear and stress, and that is not your fault.
I was actually in a very similar situation last year. Therapy and anti-depressants/anxiety helped pull me out of the disgusting pit I was in after the matter, and confiding in a few great friends brought some relief. Accepting that I am not the one at fault, and that I am still a powerful, capable person has been hard but not impossible. 
I hope you find the support and love you deserve, and I hope that rapist chokes to death on a gumball.
