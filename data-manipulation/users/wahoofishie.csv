AmItheAsshole,ff9xvog,t3_esc727,1579723871.0,"NTA... but i do feel bad for her. elderly people often suffer from loneliness. not defending her behaviour obviously, but she probably wanted to be friends, although she was very inappropriate. you should just sit down and have a talk with her about it, if she still doesn't understand and apologize then you can cut her out for good"
