The vast majority of Trump's supporters don't want liberals dead, dude. We just think that you're very clearly batshit insane and it just seems like an incredibly bad idea to let you have any power whatsoever."
tucker_carlson,fg521b5,t1_fg4sfq9,1580516353.0,It's disappointing that you're getting downvoted. I never registered to vote in California but I still got jury summons. This really isn't difficult to verify.
explainlikeimfive,ffxw2gb,t1_ffxo4z2,1580333550.0,"Man, why the hell do we set limits on RF exposure low enough for this to ever be a thing? It's just fodder for idiots to claim that we're all being irradiated to death by our phones."
explainlikeimfive,ffxvmlu,t1_ffxn8pj,1580333304.0,"No, not necessarily. All charged particles produce an electric field whether they're moving or not. It's just that protons and electrons are usually balanced pretty well. All you need is something that's keeping the charged particles of different polarities from mixing. Living tissue contains a lot of electrolytic solutions and a lot of dielectric materials, and that won't necessarily change once the nervous system stops firing."
explainlikeimfive,ffxv9sd,t1_ffxshya,1580333104.0,"Damn, that's a scary thought. I already knew about the diffraction limit, but I never thought of it in that context. The heat death of the universe is probably going to look pretty JPEG."
explainlikeimfive,ffxuy4x,t1_ffxr7xs,1580332924.0,"No, there's no real connection between being alive and having an electric field. The electric field is more of a consequence of the physical composition of a body. We're pretty much a bag of electrolytic solution. Mostly salty water. When you dissolve an ionic compound, it separates into a positive ion and a negative ion. This wouldn't result in a measurable electric field on its own because the charges will necessarily cancel out, but there are a lot of other things in our meat solutions that can produce an imbalance, which means there is an electric field. After all, all protons and all electrons produce an electric field, but since they cancel each other out perfectly, you need to get a shitload more of one polarity in one place before we can really measure it. 

I mean, keep in mind that all of the space around us is full of ripples in this electric field caused by the motion of charged particles propagating through spacetime (like radio waves), so any localized electric field needs to be strong enough to stand out against that background, like someone yelling in a room full of people talking. 

So really, the electric field is associated more with biological material rather than a ""soul."" Dead meat doesn't stop being meat for quite some time."

WatchRedditDie,fff48ew,t1_ffej2i2,1579875278.0,I mostly agree except for your last point. It's not uncommon for very profitable companies to do fundraising. I worked for a company that raised $150m from venture capital despite being very profitable. The VP of engineering had me help with a presentation to the prospective investors. We were about to open a new data center. Companies don't like to spend their own money.
explainlikeimfive,ffekysm,t1_ffdafx5,1579852432.0,The mean free path decreases as the pressure increases. That means the oxygen molecules are statistically more likely to collide and react with any gaseous fuel molecules. It absolutely makes a difference even if it's a pure oxygen atmosphere either way.
ShitPoliticsSays,ff8p3n8,t1_ff8844t,1579689848.0,"Absolute fucking bullshit. Automation has been around for centuries now. The number of jobs lost to the switch to further automation pales in comparison to how much our population has grown. The labor supply changes in response to demand. There are hundreds of millions of people now employed doing jobs that no one could've imagined in 1850. These jobs didn't just replace the ones that were lost, they increased further than that.

To pretend that somehow automation will result in a significantly higher unemployment rate is fucking preposterous and unfounded. Automation increases the value of each employed human being. You're assuming that the value in the economy is a fixed quantity, but that has literally never been true at any point in human history. The individual value of each person's labor would decrease if that were the case, but in reality, it has gone up exponentially.

If it hadn't, I wouldn't have to listen to dumbasses on the internet who are oblivious to what they don't know and parrot bullshit talking points from people who want us all enslaved and dependent on the government. We'd probably both be dead of smallpox, but best case scenario would be farming.

When a farm only needs a tenth of the labor thanks to automation, that means 90% of those laborers are now free to create value in other ways. They might go to work in a factory making cars, or maybe they go to school and become engineers or scientists. Then they can invent entirely new fields in which to employ the masses. This is the basis of a healthy economy. Government interference destroys this."

Most of them are based on radio triangulation that operate on very different frequency ranges that the military won't be jamming.

It's kinda weird that they're doing this on US soil, though. Makes me wonder if it's routine or if they're preparing for something. GPS jamming would only really be a concern with a more advanced foe than we're normally up against."

spacex,fem2ic6,t1_fem0zj2,1579237609.0,"This is a nice thought and all, but thinking like this really isn't helpful. There's a reason SpaceX doesn't really employ any theoretical physicists. None of that translates into real construction at all and won't for several hundred more years if we're lucky. It's honestly not even good inspiration. The majority of people on Earth don't give a single fuck about Kardashev's bullshit scale, and for good reason. It doesn't affect them, will never affect them, and its very existence represents a tiny drain of human effort that could've been directed towards improving everyone's lives.

Sorry to be such a downer, but I just want more people to realize how inspiring the _near_ future really is. When the US economy experiences a downturn, you'll notice a lot more long-term fantasy type thinking like this crops up because the real inspiration has disappeared and left behind a vacuum. The economy now is fucking fantastic and it's time to bring your head down out of the clouds so we can start making the dreams into reality. Real life involves a lot more engineering and a lot less Fermi estimation."

I've often thought about becoming fully energy independent, but that prompts a thought about how that affects the market. It's going to be interesting to watch this unfold. Fewer customers to amortize the costs of infrastructure put the utility company in a weird spot. 

I'm assuming taxpayer subsidized infrastructure will fill the gap, but man, that sucks. The more people move to independence, the higher the taxes will go to. Eventually we'll all be paying more in taxes than we saved if that keeps up."

Military planes fly at low altitudes like that all the time. Granted, it's probably quite rare for something with such a huge radar cross section to be that low in enemy territory, but I'm just not fucking buying that this was an innocent mistake. Commercial flights are extremely regular and scheduled. All missile crews should absolutely be very aware of the positions of any airliner, they're broadcasting their position, airspeed, and altitude CONSTANTLY."

This is why I just can't agree with a lot of conservatives on abortion. Yeah, it's morally abhorrent and I see why they're against it, but I personally think that in most cases, the abortion itself is merciful. As much we want to, we can't help every kid with batshit insane parents. Many of them just commit suicide after years of suffering. It's ridiculous and it's unfair, yeah. But so is forcing a child to be born to mentally unstable parents and forgetting about it until those parents starve the kid to death or whore them out as ""drag queens."" Until we get a hell of a lot better at helping the kids who need help right now, it's irresponsible to bring in more. And by better, shit, I'd be glad if we really did anything at all."
