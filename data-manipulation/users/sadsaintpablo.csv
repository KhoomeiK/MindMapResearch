As strange and absurd the explanation is in the third movie i liked it, because nothing was explained in the first two movies and their plats were crazy. it just makes sense to me that when we get the explanation for how everything happened it is crazy and out of nowhere.

He said he didn't care either way because it has never been defined more than just pay 10%.
