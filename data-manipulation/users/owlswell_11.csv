relationship_advice,feknzpz,t3_epkcq1,1579204021.0,"In a healthy relationship a partner stops trying to initiate sex after being said no twice (max). No explanation needs to be given.
The fact that you had to explain that you were sick  more than once and he still cared about sex rather than your health, is enough to conclude that the man you call your partner is neither a good partner nor a good man."

relationship_advice,fde7hd8,t3_ek8wyo,1578332862.0,"You would much rather confront him. **Why**?? You need to get away from that person. ASAP.

You cannot make him think about his actions. You cannot make him better. He will react in either one of the 2 ways - a) violently. b) say he is sorry. But that will just be pretension. If you want to confront him, do so in court.

By going to confront him, in whichever you, you are risking your safety, if not immediately, then certainly in the future."

relationship_advice,fd8ssqh,t3_ek8wyo,1578222952.0,"Also, please don't hate on me for saying this, but both of you need basic biology classes. Women can get pregnant anywhere between ages 10 to 40. But you don't want to make a 10 yr old a mother just because her periods started. This 18-24 as the perfect age to have kids is masonic era bullshit. And the fact whether you push a boy out or not depends on the guy. See all you have is the 'X' chromosome. Men have both 'X' and 'Y', and the gender of the baby depends on that.

You are not grown at 18. A lot is left (both physically and mentally).

P.S - RUN. FAST. To a University. Your boyfriend (hopefully ex) doesn't seem to be the type of guy who goes anywhere near one."

islamicsub,fd8opxd,t3_eiscyu,1578221055.0,"Nobody will give you respect based on religious identity. In this world, people earn respect based on the work they do, the value they create. How weak must you be that you need religion to give you identity? Have you no useful talent at all? Prophet (PBUH) said that education is the highest form of worship one can offer to Allah.

P.S - You make a whole video shitting on people regarding the way they spend money. Yes, it may be capitalist businesses that incite emotions, but still, everyone feels good when they receive a gift. You rebuke people for not living the way exactly you want, and then you wonder why people are wary of Muslims. It's because of people like you.  And whenever someone questions Islam logically, so-called true Muslims like you beat around the bush with emotions, with silly vitamin B, vitamin r, vitamin I non-sense."

personalfinance,fd8dvqa,t3_ek6o84,1578217238.0,"If you are in a long term relationship, you should try and help. Even if it's $1K. It will make her feel that she is not all alone in this. If your relationship is young, I suggest you talk to her about payment options.

P.S. - I am not saying that you do this for her, but if you ever NEED to ask people for money (for health issues and such), do it. Swallowing pride temporarily is better than suffering and contributing to your own long term misery."
