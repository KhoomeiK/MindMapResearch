I don’t like being hit suddenly when I’m asleep, I have PTSD from being hit by an ex and I know my husband well enough to know that he doesn’t know what he’s doing when he’s sleeping.

childfree,ffgi7ea,t3_etha4w,1579906809.0,"I have 3 dogs, and they are definitely different than having a cat. If you’re not into the puppy stuff, get an older dog. They’re usually a lot calmer and does pick up on consistent schedules quickly. 

You do have to walk them, especially if you don’t have a yard because a) potty training, you don’t want them to go in the house, b) they do need the exercise, you don’t really want a 100 lbs dog running up and down your house and tearing things up, that’s a bloody nightmare. I walk mine 3x a day. 

You do have to give them baths, and groom them though you can always get a short haired dog that doesn’t shed too much and pop them at the groomers if you like. 

Upside is that you can leave them alone once they’re trained for up to 8 hours maybe 9, depending on your dog. You can crate train them if you like, some dogs are fine with it. Or get a walker to walk them midday while you’re at work. You’ll always have a friend to go on long walks and hikes with you, they’ll probably get you going out of your home whether you like it or not.

Downside is that, having a dog is closer to having a child compared to a cat. A lot of the spontaneous things that you’re used to doing, you’d have to think twice cause Fido needs to have his walk, food etc. it’s a lot easier if you have someone who’s ok with sudden changes like that and can pick up the slack. 

If those aren’t appealing then don’t get a dog. Wait till you have the time to spare to commit to a dog before getting it."

The handler don’t just stay at home while their dogs roam around unsupervised, sniffing bombs or what not. They are there working alongside the dog. The dog did something right, they reward it. If it did something wrong, they’re right there correcting the dog. I don’t even know where to start with this. It’s like you don’t understand dogs at all. 

Ask yourself this seriously, if a child of 3 is constantly getting sweets from strangers, how exactly are you suppose to teach the child not to take sweets from them when A) you don’t want to watch/supervised the kid when it’s walking up and down the streets all day or B) keep the kid in your home where you can monitor what the child eats? It’s the same reason why you can’t teach your dog to not accept food from strangers if you’re not there. What’s stopping your dog from saying no? No one."
