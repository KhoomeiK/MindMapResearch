flashlight,fexvg1a,t3_eqks2f,1579437114.0,"I just picked up the fenix HM61R and I feel that is a direct great grandchild of a maglite. All the lights we like these days feel that they are made lovers of the maglite. Milled, black, simple."
flashlight,fexuvfj,t1_fex6l89,1579436835.0,I loved my maglites. But they just cant keep up. I never thought of them going  the diy root. That's fucking brilliant. I hope they have someone lurking the forums for ideas that sees this.
knifeclub,felm8vs,t1_feli2vx,1579225544.0,"It is! And it feels really nice in the hand. Feels like a work horse. Heavy in the palm. Easy to index, feels great in the hand. Feels like it will use like a large knife yet it is very small and out of the way when carrying it."
knifeclub,fel70gq,t3_epqvmp,1579215419.0,"After looking st it awhile, I came very happy, a few fit and finish problems.  Small gap where the scales end near the lanyard hole cutout. File marks on the spine . Jimping on the spine is a little sharp. The o ly one that bothers me is the tiny gap in the scales. It is just enough that it shows a tiny bit of a hole in the tang."
knifeclub,fel543e,t3_epqvmp,1579214256.0,Came scary sharp. Fits into the ksf pocket sheath like a dream. Gotta get an appropriate  light to go in the other pocket! Luck me

AskReddit,fdda4xo,t1_fdd9wje,1578302040.0,I LOVE YOU! I wanted to post this because I know reddit is always hilarious and often wise. You are both. Thank you again.
AskReddit,fdd9snx,t1_fdd9nkd,1578301533.0,Thank you! I have a 9 year old niece who is just getting into reading and writting. Reading was such a huge part of my life growing up and I would like to support her. I send her books ( Roald Dahl right now) and letters and she really seems to appreciate it. I am trying to make a note book for her with cool quotes and rules. This will be in there!

DrawMyTattoo,fcswhty,t3_eiqn3j,1577926880.0,"Hey. All good tattoo artists will draw you up custom work to make sure you are happy. They may charge you a deposit so that you are not waste their time but then that amount will come off the top of the tattoo price. 

Do not be deterred by a long waiting list. 
Do not be afraid to spend real money. 
The thrill of a cheap tattoo soon fades.
A shitty tattoo lasts forever. 

Good tattoo artists can charge $150-$250/hr depending on where you are. If you need any help choosing an artist there are some good resources available."
