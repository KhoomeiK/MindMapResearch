Genealogy,ffhmkp1,t3_etmk6s,1579942499.0,"So whenever I did the Ancestry DNA and my results posted, someone messaged me within an hour or two who turned out to be my 2nd cousin. I had already seen the tree he had been working on and had been insanely helpful even before we started messaging. He's also one who has helped others in trying to complete their trees. Also when I first started attempting research, there was a kind redditor who helped me find more information on my paternal grandmother and thanks to them, I have a lot more info on her family than I ever would have without!"
velvethippos,ffeyo1u,t3_et0qc5,1579870591.0,OMG! She's way too adorable and I could die with pibbles kisses! It's honestly the best part about coming home is seeing my two pits so happy to see me that they're wagging their tails hard enough to wiggle their butts!
MakeupRehab,ffey7yn,t1_ffdk82q,1579870160.0,Might be thinking of last year's Valentine's palette release. Pretty sure it was Estee Lauder and it was in a heart shaped container. I'm avoiding this release like the plague because I bought too many singles and can replicate most palettes.
Nightshift,ffexzn7,t3_et35vv,1579869933.0,"Don't break your sleep up during the day unless you absolutely have to. Also schedule any important things right after your shift so you can knock it out and go home without interfering with sleep. I'm about to lose sleep today because I failed to plan ahead lol.

Vitamin D supplements are pretty much mandatory at this point too."
muacjdiscussion,ff92d3w,t3_es8gus,1579703136.0,"I simplified my skincare routine and stick with the good ole HGs like vanicream facial cleanser, eucerin for moisturizer, and dove for the body. I use Amlactin for a chemical peel and gold bond for a PHA if I need something gentler. I don't need any fancy snail mucus or drunk elephant BS.

There's a reason they're tried and true HGs. Everything else is a gimmick imho."
RedditForGrownups,ff7flp5,t3_ervvi2,1579648419.0,Love from your dog imho. We don't deserve them.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff7dnnz,t3_eru9eo,1579647142.0,"That's been me lately. I ended up getting my 2nd dog last week and she's given me more joy in my life!

Just remember that we're all at different paces in life and there's no competition to do all these things. It gets better somehow!"
muacjdiscussion,ff27st5,t1_ff1qam8,1579496288.0,Now you got me wanting to do this with my eyeshadows I'm not using so I could have liquid eyeshadows! Thanks for the idea!
