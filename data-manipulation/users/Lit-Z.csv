TrueOffMyChest,feh0epu,t1_feglarl,1579106520.0,"I definitely see your point. But also, sticky notes arent going to save someone's life, in almost every case. It seemed like a low effort attempt. Also I'm not sure it was the school who did it, it may have been some random student who wanted to feel good about themselves. Either way, a sticky note that says ""smile"" won't prevent suicides, in fact there was a second suicide less than a month later."
