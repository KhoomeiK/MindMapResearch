Damnthatsinteresting,ff8bdgj,t1_ff8azwv,1579671761.0,Yes. Exactly. Also i didn’t see the downvotes. Wasn’t me. Come to think of it i rarely ever downvote things. I did downvote someone being hella rude in this thread somewhere. Idk why people get so emotionally charged.
wholesomememes,ff8b6t7,t1_fev18l0,1579671579.0,"I experienced that once. I kinda felt like this fat troll. When i became single after 11 years i was like who the hell is gonna ever want to see me naked again? I waited two years and finally when i became open to it and dating again i was utterly shocked that no one ever thought i was a troll and in fact were appalled to hear i ever felt that way. Being totally blunt here, casual sex changed my entire sense of self image.  I no longer feel that way about myself. Of course it’s been like 6 years now so i’d hope so but you see my point hopefully. Please go give yourself some credit, life is short honey and everyone is someones 10, please be open to letting someone enjoy what you have to offer."
wholesomememes,ff8arc0,t1_feusl56,1579671164.0,Um. Call me old fashioned but the more i love someone the more i want them to objectify me lol. “The male gaze” yeah gaze them eyes all over me please. Its selective. Just my person thats the exception.
wholesomememes,ff8anam,t1_fev0jzh,1579671058.0,Don’t let her sour attitude ruin you doing that for someone else. The right woman is going to love it.
Damnthatsinteresting,ff8a70b,t1_ff8a0ai,1579670628.0,Oh i wasn’t trying to imply you were being rude. Just responded to you in the thread because it seriously annoys me how google doesn’t answer shit! If didn’t happen nearly as much as it does when i have googled pregnancy questions like “when will i start to feel the baby kick” and it gives me the time in which the baby grows feet. I click all the other suggested drop down questions and just say forget it. This is just an example. Again in no way directed at you to be clear.
Damnthatsinteresting,ff89maz,t1_ff87xlu,1579670083.0,J google things all the time that come up with a generic response that actually doesn’t even answer my question. So to ask someone deliberately who seems to already know is really the best thing to do in my opinion. Even if some snooty fucks wanna get themselves in a tiff there will usually be at least one person willing to bd decent in a response so long as you aren’t being a dill hole in the question.
Unexpected,ff40d34,t3_eqwr0o,1579552787.0,That was an awful kiss too tbh.

instant_regret,fel3j9s,t3_epkwd7,1579213284.0,I don’t love stumbling upon a video of any ones death on my feed thanks
books,fedk646,t1_fedilss,1579013569.0,Gore triggers my trauma. And i have adverse reaction to adrenaline so for someone with anxiety my whole life i find horror to be absolutely awful. Exhausting. But people find the things i read to be boring and exhausting too lol.
AskReddit,fecuzzs,t1_fecfuaj,1578985693.0,Yeah im in agreement in this. My size small v is not a most size fits all. A horse cock and i are NOT physically compatible. Please warn me.
books,fecu4pb,t3_eo5wzv,1578984707.0,I don’t read horror or watch horror movies yet i am still resilient in life and from my trauma. Now i wanna know why
instant_regret,fecqk51,t3_eo9cqx,1578980961.0,My brother did shit like this to me all the time as a kid. The two of em talk about it and the one still laughs about it. I have struggled with a traumatic brain injury my whole life but i guess i’m glad they can laugh about it cause i didn’t die. I’m just dumb as fuck and i hate it.
aww,fe027y4,t3_engp0j,1578801240.0,"This is me today my friend.  One of my cats is the worst, the other is so clung go me. When i cry she comes runnin. Its strange and wonderful."
holdmycosmo,fdtq4wv,t1_fdtpzge,1578720472.0,Yeah yours is better. What you said.
holdmycosmo,fdtp9jr,t3_en04g3,1578720092.0,"I get the impression, and i am totally making this backstory up, but, it appears this was likely a hoppin spot probably when the clubs close for peeps to sober up, some yahoos come in stealing orders when (insert ladies) these gals had a rough night and you don’t come between a woman whose danced all night and them carbs."

HumansBeingBros,fdajav4,t1_fdaet5e,1578246690.0,Thank you
HumansBeingBros,fdaj7t2,t1_fdabvah,1578246653.0,Yes. Yes i believe they do.
HumansBeingBros,fd9s1y1,t3_ekcz9b,1578237317.0, That kangaroo has seen things it should never see. This breaks my heart. These animals are going to have ptsd no doubt. Lord i cannot fathom being near all of this its hard enough to watch from america.

AskReddit,fc43xfq,t3_efqzp6,1577405988.0,"I spent this christmas alone for the first time ever. It was pretty okay just felt like any other day, Just before midnight my ex texted to wish me Merry Christmas, was kind so I figured i would go look on his gf’s IG to see what they were up to for the holiday(he doesn’t have social media), i have looked at pics of them many times and felt fine, bit seeing them kissing in front of a christmas tree really gutted me all of a sudden. I cried for a good hour."
AskReddit,fc429hr,t3_eft9mt,1577404729.0,"Being pregnant, honest about it, not seeking a baby daddy or sugar daddy, and naively hoping there are more dudes out there than just pregnancy fetish ones. I deleted it after 6 hours and a lot of disgusting offers. God forbid i just be a normal woman looking at single motherhood wanting some normal company."
