dresdenfiles,feni5bs,t1_fen9a1a,1579285200.0,"No, that's only a part of it.  He was definitely very racist,  even by the standards of the time,  or a better term might be xenophobic - frightened of anything that wasn't Upper Crust New England. He  also displayed a fine lack of understanding science and math, even to the Middle School level. I don't know how smart he was, but if we are to use his writing as evidence, he was pretty stupid.  He tried to make things he didn't understand, with this simplistic understanding of math and science, into things that were frightening.   But non-euclidean geometry isn't scary. We live in 3d, all of our geometry is non-euclidean. It's not bizarre and otherworldly, he just failed to grasp the concept. Because he wasn't very bright.  EM radiation outside the visible spectrum isn't scary.   You've never seen the color that your TV remote emits have you?  But it's still not scary. Unless you’re Howard Lovecraft.      

On top of all that, his characters are extremely uninteresting. The case can certainly be made that he had uninteresting characters on purpose, to set them against the background of a incomprehensible universe that just didn't care about humans at all. I get that, but it's still boring. I like interesting characters!"
dresdenfiles,fengg0t,t1_fen8zyr,1579284149.0,"Sure, all this is very well said. On the other hand you gave five reasons that Harry wouldn't take up the black staff, and this is the only one that holds up.      

Yes, he >!is of winter!<. But he's not exactly happy about it and him taking the black staff/cane could easily start him on the path to increasing political machinations therein.   maybe even a way for him to get out from under that. maybe just simply a compelling story arc. or maybe you're right.   Plenty of room for the story to unfold in any of those ways.  

We've seen several times that the senior Council is not able to freely enforce their will upon A Harry.  maybe this would be circumstances different, maybe not.  

He has certainly not turned down every other similar deal. You said it yourself.  >!Winter!<

Does this seem like a story about a protagonist who never has to do something he finds horrible/uncomfortable?"
