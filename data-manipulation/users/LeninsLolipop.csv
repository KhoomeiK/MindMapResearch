wholesomememes,fenbpnb,t3_eq32x2,1579281263.0,Yeah but really wouldn’t recommend taking paracetamol after a night of heavy drinking since your liver is still processing the alcohol and paracetamol is literally poison for your liver making the combo a quick way for liver failure
explainlikeimfive,fekeaay,t3_epmy96,1579198236.0,"Pigeons can navigate using earths magnetic field and they will fly back to where their nest is. So if you want to send a message from castle A to castle B you‘ll need a pigeon considering castle B it’s nest and then brought to castle A and vice versa. For different locations you’ll need different pigeons, not much training involved. 
Since this is pretty costly, kinda complex ( keeping track which pigeon belongs to which place ) and not necessarily reliable since the pigeons could get attacked etc. most messages were delivered by human and pigeons only used in emergency cases where time was of essence."

memes,fdxjt8l,t1_fdwqccv,1578769482.0,"Well it is ‘supposed’ to be a more civilized place now seems a very shaky assumption to me. I’d even go as far and saying we are less ‘civilized’ then in the 80ies as with the end of the Cold War conflicts got more regionalized, often along ethnic borders rather then ideological ones and no superpower to control and retain local militias. 

With my initial comment I just wanted to show that shooting down a commercial aircraft in a situation of high tension ( remember, Iran hat just fired rockets at military bases in Iraq where American soldiers are/were stationed ) isn’t a sign of how ‘dumb’ or ‘amateurish’ the Iranian army is. It was a disastrous decision made by an Iranian military officer that had little to no time to answer to a perceived thread in the middle of his capital. 

If you were at the military and stationed near your capital and the warning system gave a warning of a immediate thread that could possibly leave hundreds if not thousands dead, how long would you think about a possible error of the radar?"

Most bridges in Germany used to be equipped with charges as well, there are special containers for mines ( even nuclear ones, America was crazy in the 60ties ) and a lot of highways can be build into rudimentary runways but in a time where you don’t need to see anything to just blast the hell out of it it all got kinda outdated"

Edit: 

Yeah okay so that came of pretty bad, I didn’t want to upset anyone.
Addiction is horrible and crippling and heroine is especially bad. I really didn’t want to be disrespectful. I have taken heroine once and I see why people don’t come off of it. I know od’s are a serious problem. What I wanted to express was that although I’m definitely no expert I know a lot of addicts/ex-addicts, they told me many stories and at least I haven’t heard of many stories where people died after 2 years just from heroine alone. Speedballing, yes but just heroine, very little. Maybe drug culture is different where I come from. 
I’m very sorry for everyone that I have offended with my post, I really didn’t mean to piss anyone off.

Edit edit: 
Many have mentioned fentanyl which might just be the cause of the confusion since here in Europe it’s more or less unknown and pretty much impossible to get."

I don’t want to disrespect the dead that were ambushed in a heinous attack without a chance to defend themselves but by far it wasn’t the worst thing in American history, nor the greatest betrayal in military history or whatever. It’s worth noting, the dead should be mourned and honored but at least in my opinion it shouldn’t be the national trauma it is"
facepalm,fby0lx4,t1_fbx6yhz,1577205216.0,"Yeah but do you really think it’s ‘good’ food? It’s food yeah, probably better then what you’d find in a dumpster, true. You have a (very small and uncomfortable) shelter, yes. But people that tend to argue that prison is better then being homeless miss one important thing you’ll lack in prison, your freedom. Being in jail means you cannot leave. Your situation cannot improve. You’re stuck there until you’ve served your sentence but you’ll be punished by society until the day you’ll die. If you get a day job as a homeless person, or people are kind enough to give you some money you’ll be able to get some nice food, not the same stuff everyday they’ll serve in prison. Besides that no one can force you to do anything as long as you’re free. 
I get that being homeless seems so frightening that many people would prefer a prison sentence above living on the streets and especially in some countries it might be better to stay in prison than to stay out in winter but 15 years is 15 years. 
People nowadays tend to forget the value of their freedom because they’re used to it but it’s one of the most valuable achievements of humanity that at least a great part of the total population can live and die in freedom, don’t throw it away easily."
