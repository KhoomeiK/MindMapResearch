I feel like her character got the worse ending out of everybody, only only did <!her sister die!> She is also forced to live with herself and the pessimistic mindset she develops during the events taking place.
I found her a little annoying in the beginning, but her character is a 15 year old, basic LA kid which makes it understandable. She's the person who genuinely didn't deserve any of this."
