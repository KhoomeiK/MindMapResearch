The process of impeachment is used for non legislative branch officers."

Sacramento,ff2t2if,t1_ff25mzf,1579522978.0,"No contest is the exact same as guilty.  You'll pay the same either way.

You can fight it, but fighting an infraction offense is actually hard in CA.  You'll usually have better luck if you get a real judge rather than an admin law judge which is just a lawyer who does infraction cases.

You can also fight it by trial by mail.  

IANAL so contact one if you want legal advice."

Want a more expensive drug that's on same tier of the formulary as the cheaper drug?  Fuck you.  Oh, the cheaper one doesn't work as well.  Well fuck you even more. 

I despise Kaiser."
