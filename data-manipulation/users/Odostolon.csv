According to the wiki page on the r-process, it is responsible for the creation of half of all elements heavier than iron. And: it is considered to not only happen in merging neutron stars. It is also thought to appear in low-mass supernovae and type II supernovae.

Which takes energy. But energy can’t be created so it has to come from somewhere. The neutron stars are losing kinetic energy, meaning they will get closer and eventually collide.

worldnews,ff5sd0u,t1_ff4g42m,1579608408.0,"A maglev train can reach speeds just shy of 600 km/h. Let’s assume an average travel speed of 500 km and we use the distance between Regina and Toronto because it’s a driving distance of 2,700 km. This distance could be covered in roughly five to six hours. 

According to google flights, Air Canada covered that in roughly three hours. 

Now keep in mind that flights are relatively often delayed and can be made impossible by weather conditions. Additionally, the airports will take some time away from you. I tend to make sure I’m at the airport 1.5 hours before departure. Half an hour before departure is when boarding starts and I‘d like some buffer for security checks and possible delays. All in all my travel time is 4.5 hours already. Then I still need to get into the city itself. I’ve never been to Canada but where I live, airports are not in the city center. In Munich, getting to the main station takes an additional 45 minutes by train. So let’s add another 30 minutes. 

So from YQR to Toronto city center we’re talking about five hours. Assuming the maglev train travels from main railway station to main railway station, we have roughly six hours.

At more than 28 solar masses a star turns into a black hole. The reason why there’s not a lot of them near us is that there are no stars being born near us. Large states burn out fast and die. That means, without new stats being born here, the large ones that used to be here are long gone.

Long story short, Nvidia does a terrible job implementing things like the OpenGL standard. Because of their market share, game devs use Nvidia cards as reference while developing. The game works on the messy Nvidia drivers, it gets shipped and then breaks on AMD and Intel because they actually implement the standards correctly.

From Pop!_OS website: 

„Privacy os precious. Pop!_OS does not collect or store any information from user installations. Minimal OS and hardware version data is used (but not stored) to provide [...] updates and connectivity verification“

Judging by that it would seem Pop! never adapted Ubuntu’s scummy data selling practices."

In addition, by doing that, they’re doing the exact thing that pushes a lot of people (me included) out of using Microsoft and Google systems."

Looks like people mostly have a problem with canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. 

From my personal perspective: I don’t like Ubuntu‘s package manager, I don’t like the unity desktop, I don’t like how bloated it is by default and I don’t like how it just feels so much like Windows, as in „it does everything for you“.

Additionally, I didn’t stop using Microsoft’s operating system just to jump on the bandwagon of the next company with an OS. I want my OS to be open source and community supported."

nvidia,fej7jeq,t3_enjaew,1579160200.0,"People that use Nvidia with Linux: 

I’ve read quite a bit about Nvidia using scummy practices related to their market share and implementation of the OpenGL standard. Additionally, their open source drivers are said to be borderline unusable for gaming. 

Both these things are kind of big deals for me. Can you give me a convincing reason to use a budget Nvidia card anyways instead of AMD? 

The AMD card I’m looking at is the upcoming RX 5600 for reasons of price and acceptable performance per Watt. Price/Performance and Performance in general is not so much of an issue for me."

TechNewsToday,fehtj2j,t1_fehkfz3,1579123573.0,"He’s right, though, at least in this instance. Three people accused of spying for China is laughable compared to the spying the US does on germany. This goes from wiretapping the German chancellor’s Phone over industry espionage to „bulk collection“ about the German population. 

It’s suspected that the top floor of the US embassy in Berlin hosts IT Equipment for that very purpose. It is windowless with a high energy profile as anyone with eyes and an infrared camera can tell you. These kinds of spy rooms aren’t a myth either. They have been found in the US before."

Apple is actually pretty damn reasonable when it comes to user data. Relatively speaking of course. The only thing I don’t agree with is Siri and even then it was just „I don’t want to use it“ and Apple was like „oh ok“ and i wasn’t bothered again.

Oh and on the topic of Sign In with Apple: that’s actually pretty amazing. Sure, Apple will still have your data. But if you use a smart device at all, somebody will always have your data. What Sign In with Apple dis is it prevents third parties from also getting your data. You’re simply reducing the amount of entities that know everything about you to 1. 

Would I rather use no smartphone than Pay the Apple price? Yeah. Are their services good? Also yes."
