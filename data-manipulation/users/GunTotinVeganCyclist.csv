AskReddit,fcjavuc,t3_ehg5ac,1577681673.0,"Was waking the dog at 11pm at night with my wife, between the train tracks and the backside of a gym. Up ahead, 2 guys stumble out from under a tree, look at us, talk for a second and start walking in the same direction as us, but slowly. Every 15 paces or so, they stop, look at us, talk to each other and keep going, but slowly so we catch up. The do this about 6 times. Eventually we get close and by this time I'm ready. Once we're within 5 yards, they turn towards us at the same time, one tries to get behind us while the other started talking to us super rapidly to distract us. The one trying to flank us was holding a tazer and had completely blood shot eyes. The one doing the talking had a strobe light. Out came my came my .357 Magnum with laser (S&W 686+ with crimson trace grips for you gun people), they got one look at it and took off running as fast as they could. Called the police to file a report. Find out later that 2 men were arrested matching my discription, they were wanted for murdering another homeless man. Not positive if it was the same guys, but they sure looked like it.

TL:DR, Had to draw my revolver on two homeless guys trying to mug us. They were wanted for murder."

Too much, you die, too little and your virtually paralyzed but conscious and feeling pain. Anesthesiologists have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for liability insurance and is a profession all it's own. It's too much for 1 person to be responsible for your anesthesia and your surgery."
