Although we aren't exporting any tropical fruit, you will see that there is a steady export trade in potatoes, tomatoes, carrots etc while also importing them.

I read an article many years ago that stated that Canadian carrots have a great taste and are shipped to the USA, however they have more blemishes.  Canadians preferred the better looking imported carrots. Other reasons may include exporting produce used in specialty applications like cereal ingredients or feed, while importing similar produce for table service."
explainlikeimfive,ff5u8wv,t3_ertxg6,1579610439.0,"Scientists who studied diets would look at what a recommended balanced diet looked like and then start removing different elements one by one.  When an animal would start to demonstrate  certain effects from the lacking diet (compared to those receiving a normal diet), it would be determined that the missing element be considered as essential.

One guy named Casimir Funk (one of those names stuck in my noodle) found that a certain type of chemicals called ""amines"" were essential...or vital. He named them ""vital amines"" or ""vitamins"".

Although vitamins are no longer strictly amines, each one has a different role in the body (skin, bones, neural networks).  A lot of foods may start with vitamins in then, but due to heating, mashing, etc in the food processing, they can become ineffective.  Because a lot of food travels long distances to reach us, or is heavily processed, it is recommended to supplement our diets with vitamins and other elements.

TLDR: each one is different and does different things."

todayilearned,fdqiw8r,t3_emr4e7,1578667775.0,"I used to perform international air ambulance transport and in my experience, air expands at altitude, meaning an air pocket gets bigger as you climb.  This would have made her condition worse and the immediate thing we would have done would be to descend (if at all possible) to a level where a sea level cabin was achievable. 
 Note that a pressurized cabin of an airplane at 37,000' doesn't pressurize to sea level, but to 4000' or so.  Flying at 25,000' might get you close to achieving a sea level cabin but that consumes a ton of fuel due to denser air and you would have to stop more frequently.  This may have not been possible due to the topography and other issues.  Regardless, a pneumothorax is an immediate thing that has to be dealt with.  The trapped air starts to build with each breath, literally taking the place of where the lungs would expand (i.e. you can't expand the lungs) and the heart starts to get squeezed.

Therefore, I don't believe the issue to perform surgery immediately had to do with *increased* *air* *pressure* *during* *descent*, but because of the immediate need to resolve the pneumothorax.  Still, it was an excellent resolution for an immediate critical situation."
