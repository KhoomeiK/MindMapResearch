I find it nice to taste the ingredients more individually before combining them (that is if I even decide to combine them in the end)."

And if a lock is the only thing preventing them from stealing, they're not honest in the first place. Keep them honest=prevent opportunist thievery, which is a silly expression."

FoodPorn,fftchaq,t1_fftbvmc,1580216372.0,"Wtf? A dish is not defined by its sides, and ""fried chicken"" is never pan fried in a small amount of fat. ""Hot chocolate"" isn't simply chocolate that's hot. Offer somebody 'hot chocolate' and then stick a Hershey's bar in the microwave and see how they react."

FoodPorn,fftbklo,t1_fftahyv,1580215515.0,"Chicken nuggets are chicken nuggets, and fried chicken is fried chicken. Fried chicken in homes doesn't have to use a deep fryer, but you do use a lot more fat (traditionally done with at least 1/4"" of fat or more, often lard back in the day, in a cast iron skillet)."

FoodPorn,ffta7ul,t1_fft8kl8,1580214142.0,"I call BS. This is the land of KFC. ""Fried chicken"" is a nationally known dish. Of course what OP did is fried chicken in that it's chicken that's fried, but 'fried chicken' almost universally refers to deep-fried (often pressure-fried) chicken with a characteristic blend of spices."

Gouging like that is gonna lead to violence. But you also gotta wonder how much access to proper jobs dude had.
