AskReddit,ffc87ws,t3_esi1iu,1579793780.0,"I worked at Circuit City from 2004-2006. It was my first job out of high school. I was hired as a temporary worker during Christmas but then stayed on. I was a sales associate in the computer and camera sections. We knew the company was failing, but the closure was a bit of a surprise. 

When I first started the big thing our managers pushed was attachments. This means when selling a printer, make sure they get the USB cable and ink. When selling a digital camera make sure they get a memory card or two, a case, a strap, and maybe even a photo printer. Finally, everything should be sold with a Circuit City ""protection plan"" because it's in the customer's best interest. It should be noted that at Circuit City cables, ink, memory cards, and all the various accessories had the highest margins. We're talking like 300-500% markup over stores like Walmart. I didn't think much of it because, while a bit shady, we were still selling quality products that people needed. That all changed suddenly in late 2006.

I don't remember the month, but suddenly our management team changed. We got a new store manager, merged several departments and eliminated the overlapping managers, and they introduced team leads. The team leads were sales associates that were also responsible for managing employee schedules, working as an escalation point for customer issues, and ensuring the sections were clean and had proper inventory. Basically they offloaded management's responsibilities to some sales associates and gave them a $0.50 raise. 

On top of all that, there was a huge push to sell the protection plans on EVERYTHING. For those that don't know, the store ""protection plans"" are anything but. It's a warranty of sorts that is sold by a third party. They will do anything possible to avoid paying out for a claim. You bought a $400 warranty on your new laptop and it broke? Well it's probably because you left it in your bag and were too careless with how it was handled. Oh you got the accidental damage protection plan? Well I'm sorry to tell you that a broken keyboard is normal wear and tear, and isn't covered. It was terrible. The store managers would have training sessions in which they spout the same of mantra that the protection plan was in the customer's best interest. It helps protect them when the manufacturer doesn't. This all came from some corporate office somewhere. None of the sales associates believed it. We were required to ask about adding a protection plan, but we all knew not to push it. While this approach used to be acceptable, suddenly we were being written up for not meeting our numbers. Which we all felt was ridiculous because you can't force someone to buy something. (We did actually have a manager tell us once that if a customer is buying a big ticket item, like a computer or a TV, and they refused the warranty, that we should refuse to sell them the item and ask them to leave.) We lost several people when that happened.

The next sign of failure was when they announced massive lay-offs. While I and most of my coworkers were hired on as hourly employees, we still had some veterans around that worked on commission in the past. Commission wasn't a thing anymore and hadn't been since 2003-ish. What Circuit City did for their commissioned sales associates was to take their average pay via commission and convert that into an hourly pay. This meant that while I was making $10 an hr, these folks were often making $17, $19, or even $20 an hour. Well Circuit City fired all of these folks. Anyone making over $15 an hour was terminated. These people were then offered their old positions again at a pay rate of $12 an hour. We lost a lot of people when that happened.

Circuit City used to care about its sales staff, which meant that the staff cared about the customer. Sales associates made decent money thanks to commission, and had been around long enough to learn the product and could actually help customer's make informed decisions. Suddenly the shopping experience was dealing with some young kid with limited knowledge who was more interested in selling you a protection plan than helping you pick out a good TV.

The final nail in the coffin was quite literally the announcement of closing. I wasn't around when this happened, but kept up with a few friends that still worked at Circuit City. We had heard rumblings about how the company was failing the last few months I worked, but we weren't involved in the sales meetings. We would just hear our manager deliver the ""numbers"" to us and say we all needed to do better. We knew that nothing had changed and we were doing just as well as we always had, so something had to be up. According to my friends, there was a store meeting that took place one morning in which a number of managers said their goodbyes. The staff was informed that the company was closing all stores and a transition team would come in to see through the closure. A liquidation manager took over and told everyone they could stay on and help liquidate the store. Sales staff only, as managers had all been let go as this point. The staff would be compensated at their normal hourly rate. From what I heard from my friends that stuck around, they never were paid. I don't know what ever came of that.

I don't miss Circuit City one bit. The managers there were some of the worst people I have ever worked with. The corporate office cared only for one thing: making money. I ended up going back to school, getting a degree, and kick starting my career as an IT engineer. I credit Circuit City for that, because after working there for 16 months, I knew I needed a real career or I would be stuck in that hell hole my whole life. Or I guess at least until they went down in flames."

It was great because it really reinforced that he wasn't a good guy anymore. That child was Arthas and the dude we had been chasing all xpac was the Lich King. We haven't had an expansion that focused on a super villian from the start since Cataclysm. It's been this stupid cycle of horde warchief is kinda bad, wait he's just crazy, no he's definitely bad bad super bad, we stopped him, or maybe we didn't, stay tuned next expansion for more!"
