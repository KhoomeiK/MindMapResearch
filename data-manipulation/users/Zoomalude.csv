comics,fgk0n8b,t3_eyrbpz,1580855076.0,It's almost like there's a difference between an audience member paying money to go to a comedy show (and thus the comedian getting paid) and tuning in to listen to a free podcast.

Hold the marshmallow close to the coals, not near the flame (notice in the picture you can see very burnt down coals). This applies intense, fairly constant heat to the marshmallow without chance of catching. Wait for smoke to start coming off the side facing the heat. Give it 3-5 seconds after that then pull it away and marvel at your creation."
