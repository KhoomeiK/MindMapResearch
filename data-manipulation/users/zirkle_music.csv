AskReddit,fepao3k,t3_eq1wzh,1579315922.0,"Enough money to never have to worry about a bill again. I am sick of tired feeling never good enough for my girlfriend all because of money. Living paycheck to paycheck isn't the life to live and I want that to change so bad. With me being in college and working only 20 hours a week, it never feels like enough. My parents can't/won't help me out because they have their own things to deal with. I can't catch a break and it's making me forget why I even try to keep up with everything. I'm sick of it all."

drums,fdsfpw5,t3_emxkpt,1578701732.0,This man was the first drummer I was introduced to when I started out at 12 years old. I watched his drum solo videos constantly and would always sing along with him since I knew every single thing he would do. Man this hit me hard seeing it.
AskReddit,fdrx1f4,t1_fdqhqgc,1578690986.0,This is all I needed to invest in their products! I've always been super scared of how expensive their stuff is. But this gives me a lot of confidence! Thank you!
college,fd6d80a,t1_fczzmnd,1578189185.0,You could add Iowa to the FAFSA to see what you would get from there and that could help out with deciding!
college,fczz0p4,t1_fcz4y8j,1578111077.0,Have you done your FAFSA yet?
college,fcyao20,t3_ejeuio,1578077239.0,"Have you looked at University of Iowa? I'm currently there and their accounting program has to be one of the best in the nation. I don't know how they work with students from out of state but I haven't really seen a tuition difference amongst someone who's lived in Iowa their whole compared to someone who's from Illinois. Something to definitely consider though.

Their financial aid office has helped me in more ways than I can count now. With small fees on my u-bill that I couldn't pay at the time would just disappear because of them.

I would definitely take a look here if you aren't still sure on what to do!"
