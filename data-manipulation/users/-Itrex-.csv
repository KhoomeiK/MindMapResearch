Edit: craft the L7 team stamina rune with 3 speed runes (or other runes of the type desired). Best case you will get an L8 speed rune. More likely the level will stay the same or decrease by 1. And the type may not change either. In my case, it downgraded the first time and did not change type. I tried again and it downgraded again but did change type."

Full disclosure I was born in 1962, so am technically a boomer. But the phrase is bullshit. People are people. They do their best, or don’t, and frequently fuck up. Pinning the ills of the world on a particular generation is a cop out. Bernie and Donald are both boomers. Presumably most of you admire one and detest the other. So generation is pretty useless as a way of categorizing people."
