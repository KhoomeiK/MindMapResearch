The scientists didn't miss it, they were not the ones reviewing the photos. They were the ones who set up the equipment and knew what photos to take. They didn't use his home-made telescopes, they used expensive professional kit. He was performing a task that today would be automated. The task did not require a degree, just patience as for any menial task."

> We should use nuclear, nuclear is clean and it is going to last for centuries without refueling

[If you are talking about existing technologies that are commercially viable, nuclear will last around another 80 years.](https://phys.org/news/2011-05-nuclear-power-world-energy.html) This is when suitable reserves of uranium run out, leaving only things like seawater extraction, which make it too expensive compared to the alternatives.

If you are talking about sci-fi tech, like fusion or thorium, neither of these are commercially available despite decades of research and billions in R&D. 

It's more sensible to switch to clean, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies like renewables + storage if we want to achieve a carbon-free grid as soon as possible."

dataisbeautiful,ffrjidu,t1_ffrh7we,1580159294.0,"> And yet, no one is writing articles about England's breakfast culture. 

Because it's well-established and therefore not newsworthy. England is already famous for it's elaborate and extravagant breakfasts. Somerset Maugham famously said in 1898, “To eat well in England you should have breakfast three times a day.” Australia has finally caught up with the rest of the world, hence journalists rejoice and write about it. 

> If you'd been to Australia in the last 10 years you would understand.

I have done. The breakfasts are lovely, if you go to the right place, but nothing you couldn't find in almost any major international city for decades (excluding horrific indigenous roadkill - you can keep your koala tartare or whatever other local monstrosity you concoct). 

Your comment reminded me of Jules Verne's description of Phileas Fogg's breakfast at a London club in his 1873 novel, Around the World in 80 Days, to describe the breakfast of an English gentleman at the time:

> His breakfast consisted of a side-dish, a broiled fish with Reading sauce, a scarlet slice of roast beef garnished with mushrooms, a rhubarb and gooseberry tart, and a morsel of Cheshire cheese, the whole being washed down with several cups of tea, for which the Reform is famous. 

So, as you can see, indulgent brunches are hardly something new or unique. It's on page 13 here if you want to read it yourself: https://www.planetebook.com/free-ebooks/around-the-world-in-80-days.pdf."
