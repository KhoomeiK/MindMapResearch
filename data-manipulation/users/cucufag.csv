> To receive the $300 checking bonus: 1) Open a new Chase Total Checking account, which is subject to approval; AND 2) Have your direct deposit made to this account within 90 days of account opening. Your direct deposit needs to be an electronic deposit of your paycheck, pension or government benefits (such as Social Security) from your employer or the government. Person to Person payments (such as Chase QuickPay® with Zelle®) are not considered a direct deposit. After you have completed all the above checking requirements, we'll deposit the bonus in your new account within 10 business days.

So the question is whether or not your tax returns is considered a direct deposit from the government. You can try calling up customer support to ask. At the very least, I would maintain the minimum requirement to avoid balance fees in case it doesn't work out, so you don't lose money trying. The easiest condition in your case is maintaining a 1500 dollar balance in the checking account every day until you close it."

Frankly I don't even understand how so many people think that 300+ hour gameplay is an attractive draw to a game anymore. If someone tells me a game has more than 40 hours of content, I lose a lot of interest in playing it. We no longer live in a world where you buy like a couple games a year and hope it lasts you. Everyone has dozens of games they own and have in their backlog and haven't touched.

Some personal takeaways from this.

Allegations are singular and anonymous, so we can't give it too much credibility. I'm not dismissing it, I'm just not going to assume it is true either. Floating the possibility until additional witnesses step forward, or the anonymous person provides evidence or some sort.

Best Buy's internal investigation is probably going to turn up clean regardless of what they find.

Timing of her sexual activities with an executive possibly be related to her promotion to CEO? Seems far fetched and conspiratorial but I'm entertaining the idea. Also I would hate for a female CEO to be accused of sleeping her way up.

She should absolutely NOT vacate her position during the probe. The accusation isn't substantial enough to warrant such a huge move, and if this could make CEOs stop working then it would empower people to start imitating them.

If it turns out to be true, I wouldn't actually mind too much because I think Corie Barry is a huge disappointment compared to Hubert."

> If I can make a game in a week and make $500, maybe I can make a game in a year and make $50,000.

Releases can flop regardless of the past or added dev time and effort so always be careful when making a large plunge like this. My rule of thumb is that if you want to quit your job to make games full time, you should be financed enough that you won't need to sell your house or car even if the game is a total flop."

This model doesn't have a slot or anything to fill out artwork. Outside of doing some hardcore diy modding, the most convenient options available to you are going to be decals. You're either looking at a print service for a full top sticker style with button cutouts, or maybe something like a waterslide decal for a more hands on approach.

If you're really hardcore, you could sand down the topcoat, spray paint it, and then waterslide it for a truly custom job, but that's a lot of work. You'll want to seal it, and automotive finish is the recommended option for a professional looking polish and durability.

For anyone looking at this thread, if you're wondering when you should leave, the answer is now. Recruiters love geek squad agents. They'll take you at 6 months of experience. They'll take you even if you're worried that you didn't get enough experience because you didn't get to fill the ARA role. You'll swiftly find a better job. 

Geek Squad is very powerful on your resume. Clean that paper up. Look up resume guides, format it, get it reviewed by professional contacts. It will at least land you the interview. Then practice your interview skills. This is the most important skill you'll refine in your life. You don't need to actually know anything about tech. You'll learn most of what you need to do hands on at your next job. The month I decided ""maybe I'm ready to start looking"" I got a dozen interview offers. I landed a solid gig with Delta despite not actually being properly qualified. I sat down at the interview and was immediately told my tech background was lacking. I left that interview being showered with praises and despite being told they had a dozen more interviews to do that day, everyone in that room basically knew I had the job."

I honestly view everyone below 23 as kids, lol. Heck I still catch myself thinking I'm a kid. I'm almost 30 now and it's only starting to dawn on me that I might actually be an ADULT.

I certainly don't think I was properly equipped to deal with being an adult in my early 20's. I had to make a ton of mistakes, and a lot of things I didn't even know I was doing wrong this whole time for years and years after.

If I had a kid and they want to go become independent at 18 I'm not stopping them but I'm probably going to encourage them to stick around until their career or start of family takes them elsewhere. Also if you want to leave at 18 then you're gonna sit through adulting bootcamp first and not move so far away that I can't come take care of your dumb ass mistakes."

If you do not have any connections to a recruiter, try updating your LinkedIn account and start looking for jobs there.

Of course, phones department always lists as 0 dollars in sales, since phones are ""sold"" at 0 dollars and the store receives a massive kickback behind the scenes for the contract/plans. 

Even though the profit on strawberries were like 12 cents a case and the profit on a phone was anywhere from 200 to 400 dollars, the managers didn't respect a phone sale because it meant nothing on their sales numbers.

GeekSquad,fc92uhc,t3_egi79y,1577546130.0,"It's most likely just the LCD panel. Will need to be replaced. This will not be done in stores, but rather at a repair center, as the work is a bit more specialized than most store agents are equipped for. This means if you don't have an accidental protection plan, you do have to pay in to a deposit for the shipping and diagnostics and be without your computer for a couple of weeks.

The cost can depend on the model. If there is more damage than just the LCD, you may see costs going beyond the value of your laptop. Was it a touch screen? The digitizer can add costs to the repair. It's been a while since I've been in the consumer repair game, but that looks like an inspiron 3000?. I know we don't like to quote prices since it could end up being a lot more, but I just want you to know that barring no other damage and assuming it is NOT a touch screen, hope for about 150 price tag for the OEM LCD and expect upwards of 250 for other damages in the screen.

As RCS adoption continues to replace SMS messaging, one of the final inherent benefits of iOS (iMessages) should be waning away.

Hardware is probably the other big contributing factor though. Despite being a life long Android user, I absolutely cannot stand Samsung phones. I hate how they look. I hate the stock Samsung OS. I hate the company. It just keeps getting worse. I hate bixby. Alternate options for premium phones are hard to find, and require research. Google has gotten really confident in their competition to Apple lately and that's resulted in a shift towards an incredibly obnoxious pricing with their Pixel products, and I haven't been happy with the design since 3 and onwards anyways. The only other clean OS I can really find with a good design are the OnePlus and I have concerns about China and privacy. I'll be using my Pixel 2 until something that resonates with me comes out, and that might be at least another year or two. iPhone users don't really have to worry about these kinds of things, they get the X or whatever the newest is, or an 8 if they really want a home button badly enough.
