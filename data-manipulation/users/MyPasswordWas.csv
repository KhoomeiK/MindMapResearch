toastme,few55xx,t1_few216d,1579405546.0,Thank you so much for that. It’s true my 20’s have been exactly that. I have a very open mind about new opportunities.  I’m trying to remain optimistic
toastme,fev3eaz,t1_fev2tuu,1579392645.0,Thanks! I’ll write that down
toastme,feuc4ou,t1_feu954k,1579385175.0,Thanks I appreciate it. I’m trying to stay patient for June and July to roll around. I think that once I have a well paying job from graduationthings will start to change and I can focus on creating the life I’ve always envisioned. Including finally being able to put myself first.

Liberate yourself!

You’re young so if you are truly loved by him he will show it in his actions.

relationship_advice,feaumbk,t3_eoauk8,1578952314.0,"Part of me that wants to troll you on the inside says *they fuckinnnnn*

But another part of me says give him the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise. ... is it to much to check his messages? Idk. If the opportunity was there to check that text history between the two I’d be all over that like white on rice.

I’m just one person though."

SuicideWatch,fdzx2ha,t3_enakk8,1578797890.0,"Yah. Was literally listening to music driving In the rain and looked up into the night sky and thought “I don’t want to be alive rn, wish I could just do it but I don’t want to” 

I wish I knew more about the psychology of depression. 

I also just really wish I had money for counseling. At a certain point I’ll have to go to a free clinic. But I hate imagining myself going there. Just feels so dirty."

SuicideWatch,fdjhsom,t1_fdjhk03,1578471422.0,"I did try online counseling once met a guy who may or may have not been a scam artist and creeped me out actually. Met him via Reddit actually. 

I didn’t know mental health charities were a thing? That’s cool though. 

I’ll have to check out both of those and do some googling soon. 

I definitely want the help if it’s available"
SuicideWatch,fdjh85x,t1_fdjgmon,1578470692.0,"If I put in the exhaustive amount of effort it feels like finding counseling is I just end up messing it up. 

I spent like almost 300$ on a counselor for three sessions to talk about my childhood babysitter trauma that was driving me nuts. It was helpful but I lost that counselor missing two appts. He won’t see me anymore. there’s still Stuff outside of just that I want to talk about with a counselor. It’s just expensive and finding the right one plus driving to an appointment time seems like something I won’t be able to do until I have the money one day. 

My hope is that I land a pipe welding job in July when I graduate and get my last welding certifications then I can fix my teeth and get my mental health right"
SuicideWatch,fdjgyzl,t1_fdjgmon,1578470372.0,"There’s free counseling at a clinic in the same county as me, but it’s crowded and I don’t like the way it makes me feel going into an office of a counselor with a full schedule. Does that make sense?

I have trouble keeping appointments a lot too because I’ll do a codependency stint by agreeing to an appointment time that doesn’t necessarily work for my schedule but I don’t want to not get one scheduled. 

Then I get stressed, tell myself I’ll make the time and put it in my phone calendar on the drive home and forget about it all until I miss the appt.

That’s how I lost my last two primary care doctors actually."
SuicideWatch,fdjfkdg,t3_elhp3a,1578468670.0,"I have the same thoughts everyday. I have a lot of speeding tickets and lost my license from points. I drive fast hoping a deer will make me crash. It would hurt a lot. And I might not die. 

I’ve also driven drunk a lot too. Been doing that a bit more and more since I turn 21 over the past 5 years. 

It’s like I want to be dead but in the same breath I don’t want to be dead so much because I’ll miss out on life after I’m gone. Reddit is a great place because I can really just say exactly what I want and how I feel and other people feel my pain too. 

It’s exhausting. I hate feeling like this everyday even when things are getting better or my life changes for the better."

relationship_advice,fct9jrr,t3_eismwz,1577936529.0,"Prefacing what I want to say: You are beautiful and desirable. You deserve to be pursued and cherished. You are worthy of love and worthy of intimate passion with your lover.

First off understand you only live one time, having someone like him is something so special. Cherish what you have and remember that you’d do anything to win what you want out of your marriage. Remember it’s your best friend and who else would you rather work hard with when there’s work to be done other than your besty?

Options I think of:

Go to him and see about marital counseling? Find a counselor you both like?

See if you can step out of your comfort zone and think about maybe watching porn together? Maybe spice up the sex life? Surprise him with a fantasy of his if he will open up to you about his favorite things?

Write a letter to yourself about the little things you love about him. Sit and spend some time in a bubble bath and just think of your favorite moments together over the years. Really hone in your mind how deeply you love and care for your man. Write down things that make you hurt the worst, write down the things that make you feel so loved or thankful for him.

Just my thoughts from a single 25m who is a romantic and can’t wait to spoil someone one day!! 

Best of luck to you both"

Or forgive him. I think it’s still weird I definitely don’t think that way when I’m in love."
