In the desert, make a wild west train station town or a French Foreign Legion fortress. In the jungle make Ewok town or swamp stilt houses. In the tundra, an ice chalet/ski lodge (make a hill of sloped ice blocks, run a minecart to the top for the lift) or an igloo village.

Use glass and make bubble biomes, bring hell up to the surface and make an evil overlord's lair, tower to dungeon.
