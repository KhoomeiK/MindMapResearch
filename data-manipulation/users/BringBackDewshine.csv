A shell account is one made with the intent of getting karma and being sold or used nefariously. Sometimes people will age the account, just making a throwaway looking account and not logging in for months or years. Some subs have a minimum account age requirement, so they would let it sit for a time. New accounts have a limit on how often they can post until they meet a minimum karma to allow them to post freely. So, age and karma are used to deter fraudsters and trolls. You may be familiar with the term ""puppet account"": an alt account some users may use to prop up their main account. Think throwaways, but with express manipulative intent.

There are various practices used by Etsy dealers, Youtubers spammers, astroturfers etc. that are aided by the use of these accounts.

With the 2020 elections, these accounts are going to be used more and more to spread propaganda and the practice of making them is more widespread than it used to be due to Reddits increasing popularity.

In 2010, this was done for vote manipulation

2012 it was started to be used for drop shipping.

2016 Russian Trolls.

Last year Chinese trolls.

This year all of the above and then some. They need these accounts to look legit, so they'll browse Popular, steal a top comment and get quick karma and allow it to be used freely while also muddying the waters for whoever investigates the accounts unusual activity."
