insanepeoplefacebook,fcyutzr,t1_fcymdgm,1578087563.0,"Fact is, you could cross the wrong leg over while seated, and start a war.  This is someone's attempt to point fingers at Trump because they still haven't gotten over the election results nearly 4 years ago.  Most of the media and the House of Representatives have made it their goal, since election day, to do anything they can to stop the President from making any progress in the political arena.  


Tide Pods have done major damage to the part of the brain that can objectively form an unbiased opinion, and the immediate response to anything Trump does is to defame it.  It's really sad that the bulk of political education now comes from social media.    


Back to your question:  Yes, it could start a war.  The likelihood of it happening is very low.  Iran's military is sub-par, at best and they know that a war declaration would destroy them further.  Worst-case would be that you get a few rogue soldiers committing terrorist acts in retaliation.  I doubt they would even be that stupid."
