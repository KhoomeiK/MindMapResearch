“There are many community cases that remain undiagnosed — unlike in Hong Kong, where cases are more carefully handled, including the mild ones,” Hui said.
Li Lanjuan, China’s National Health Commission’s coronavirus committee, said that lack of supplies are preventing the country from doing more aggressive tests for the virus, according to state media."
