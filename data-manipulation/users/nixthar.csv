assholedesign,ffrv91g,t1_ffqyi9p,1580166614.0,"There is literally a larger body of research on psychedelics and their clinical pharmacology and use in psychiatry than on cannabis. Blow it out your ass if you can’t be bothered to read a medical journal from fucking 1955, before scheduling set back studies and research for decades. Or you can take your head even further out of your ass and read the cutting edge most recent research, which after about taking five seconds to actually understand what you’re talking about you’d realize your worthless comment is such a non-contributor to the conversation the immediate shame would cause your own psyche to collapse within itself in abject horror at its own stupidity."

Yeah, I post about nice clothing because I, like all other people in the world have things that I enjoy and I choose to invest the fruits of my labor into. Clothing comes from labor and ultimately belongs to the worker and the masses, you only view clothing through class lenses because you still cling to them as hierarchal signifiers instead of expressive treasures belonging to all of us."

Is it a little shitty to do? Yeah, but not the end of the world and it’s the nature of running a small business, especially if you are selling on Amazon. It’s called shrinkage and you need to account for it and plan around."
politics,fffmum7,t1_fffmjsu,1579887366.0,"So you’re totally cool with selling me your entire day for say, I dunno. 80? 85 bucks and me turning around and literally watching you do work that makes me hundreds of dollars that day? What a fucking spineless bootlicker. What a brainwashed little coward you are. That value was made by you and belongs to you. You gonna let some nebulous concept of “ownership” and some fucking spook like capitalism take what you made away from you? Some great person you are."
politics,fffhk28,t1_fffawx3,1579884108.0,"Quick, you have a pile of rocks. On the market, the commodity value of them is 9 dollars. When refined into a product, they are worth 100 dollars. If you pay a worker 9 dollars to make that change, where did the remaining value come from that made this rock worth more money? Did it come from the labor that transformed it from one state than another? Which is more fanciful, to say that the value is “created” simply because someone is willing to trade dead labor and has valued it at that price, or to say that the value was created as the result of transformative labor.  One of these is based in material processes we can observe, the other is an entirely internal process. Subjective marginal utility value leads to price discovery, but labor still animates that value into existence by making the physical changes in reality necessary for it be accessible. The value doesn’t exist without labor, the value is merely discovered through subjective marginal utility evaluations, not created. Labor theory of value still holds true."

That’s why soap dishes have bumps, so the soap doesn’t create a bubble between the surface of the solid soap and the counter and lock it down with vacuum. It just makes it easier to pick up.
