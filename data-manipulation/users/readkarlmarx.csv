MurderedByWords,ffnyvxo,t1_ffnh2rs,1580072408.0,"This is a vast over simplification, that does not account for wealth distribution or cost of living. The United States, while being much wealthier than China, also has more money concentrated in the top 1% than China does, which doesn’t significantly increase average life quality. China is also drastically cheaper to live in, so earning $8,826 a year is much more likely to be livable than in America. China is a poorer country, but GDP per capital is a flawed metric to analyze how poor/rich a countries citizens are."

Furthermore, you can do you own research about the 8 non-CCP parties. They exist, they cooperate with the government, and China is not a one party system. 

2) can be both

[No the Supreme Court decoded that religious freedom was more important than education](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2528&context=californialawreview) 

I agree with China here, education comes before religion.

> westboro baptist church has right to express their opinions.

I disagree. 

> in murica we let people do as they please 

Overly  religious people can never “do as they please” because they lack internal free will. Their concept of reality is so flawed and removed from reality, that they will never be able to make rational decisions. This is not free will, this is brainwashing. Admittedly, the Chinese gov does use propaganda, but at least Chinese propaganda is based in reality."
SelfAwarewolves,fe5xrza,t1_fe5x72n,1578877314.0,"Imprison minorities: Not really, see my other comments. Black men in America are more likely to be in “prison” (even if you count the reeducation camps as a  prison) than any ethnic minority in China.

Refuse to let HK have democracy: Democracy kinda sucks

Tibet: Pretty fucked I won’t lie, but they’re no “executing and jailing an entire country”

Taiwan: Taiwan doesn’t claim to be its own country, nor does it really want to. Beijing-Taiwan relations have never been better.

Vietnam: Bro every country in south east Asia claims unreasonable fishing zones. This isn’t really a China problem as much as a regional one. China is just the most powerful and gets the most shit for this.

All in all, I think the vast amount of people the Chinese government has lifted and is lifting out of abject and relative poverty greatly outweighs these political moves. My biggest criticisms of China would be Tibet, lack of environmental regulations, and how they are handling the re-education camps. However, the Chinese government is not “evil” and I take it over most governments."

2) Beneficial dictator > shithead elected presidents.

3) By that definition refugee camps at the US border are concentration camps (not to mention yall’s’ for profit prisons, with 2.3 million people in prison at any given times). Also every border with refugees would be a concentration camp under that definition. Are you really making the claim that every single country has population camps?"
SelfAwarewolves,fe5v435,t1_fe5ulc9,1578875632.0,"1) China is not 1 party.

2) Yes it’s a dictatorship but I don’t really care. Not like democracy is very effective anyways.

3) “Concentration camps” implies that they are being killed for ethnicity/sexuality/religion. Not only are they not killing anyone, but the next generation of Uyghurs will not have the same burdens of religious extremism, lack of education, and drug crime that the previous generation faced.

More on 3. Not only are the vast majority of Ethnic Uyghurs not in camps, but Uyghurs aren’t even the largest Muslim population in China. They just have the most extreme religious communities. None of what the Chinese gov is doing is based on ethnicity, sexuality, or religion. If an atheist Han Chinese community acted the same as the Uyghur communities being re-educated, they would also be re-educated. It’s not discriminatory to hold all citizens to the same standards."
SelfAwarewolves,fe5uvuh,t1_fe5ssul,1578875485.0,"Y’all let the Amish get away with not educated their kids past 7th grade. The Amish are the closest metaphor I can think of for the re-educated Uyghurs. The specific Uyghurs communities being re-educated refused to educate women, taught Islamic law over law of the land, and committed an incredibly disproportionate amount of terrorist attacks and drug crimes. I think the Chinese government is vastly over reacting (obviously not to the extent western media claims), but letting people in a developed nation live as if they were in Theocratic shithole country is no way to run a government. The US unironically could learn a lot from China about dealing with it’s extreme religious movements (Mormonism, Amish, Westboro, etc.)."

Hilarious to hear these super uneducated takes about China on reddit. If the camps are because of Islam how come the Hui people aren’t in the camps, and why are the camps only in areas with previous terrorism problems? And why has there never been any proof of the Chinese government harvesting organs, literally ever? Hint: Western media sees China as a threat to its economic system and knowingly publish smear pieces on China, knowing that no one in the States will take their side (because CommUnISm BaD) and no one is educated enough to do their research.
