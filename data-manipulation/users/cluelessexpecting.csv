BabyBumps,fh8zbgy,t1_fh8mxrx,1581370462.0,"This rings so true to me. I am happy for all my friends, family and colleagues who are thrilled, I don't want to stop their excitement. I feel so bad doing it but I just can't with all the baby talk and asking to see my belly. Whenever it is my birthday I get so anxious I can't eat - I don't like attention so people wanting to look at my stomach is too much for me. Walking into a meeting and having 15 people call you a spoil sport because you don't get your stomach out to show them then talking to me in baby voices saying I should ""eat the cake mummy, I want it"". I know my mum and MiL want to talk about it but I've had to say I'm really anxious and not dealing well so I can't but I feel like I'm robbing them of an experience. 

I love my friends little kids, I love holding them, playing with them and I'm sure I will love my own child when it arrives but right now it's too much. I have to pretend to be thrilled around my best friend as she's desperate for a child and has been trying for years. She's already buying stuff for my kid. I can't be honest with her and this is the first time I've not been able to share how I am with her. I know people judge me for not being excited. But they still persistently ask how's the baby? I'm sorry but what am I supposed to say? He's inside me. He's still alive. He's on track. I can't see him but my scan showed he was all good, so yeah not much going on really. He's not here yet. 

I'm dreading when I'm massive, I'll be 6 months in 3 weeks and bound to be big by then. Right now I just look like I had a good Christmas so I'm able to hide it quite a bit but I won't be able to and I'm just going to hate people looking in the street, people wanting to touch it (by the way, why is that OK?). I don't want to talk about it. It is not all I think about. I have major other shit going on like having a new house that still needs lots of work, we've only been in a week. My dad having a major stroke and unable to do lots of things now, my mum struggling to be his full time carer and get support. All that is much more important to me, things I can do something about that need immediate attention, but no one asks about that. Just how's the baby? 

I think I'm going to have to start taking the anti depressants coz I'm not feeling any better about it. I thought I may when I found out the gender but nope. And now I'm scared I can't connect with boys and yet that's what I'm having. 

I totally understand how you feel but I don't really know what to say. Other than you aren't alone and I don't think this will make us bad mums. We have a shed ton of hormones, our bodies are changing beyond our control and it's really daunting. I'm sure I will feel utterly different when baby arrives. It's just getting through to that point."
offmychest,fh7sq71,t1_fh7skve,1581343684.0,They are my favourite love story. And my grandpa was an incredible person who I love to tell people about.
BabyBumps,fh7lo4t,t1_fh71tr7,1581337292.0,I'm sorry you're feeling it too but it's some comfort to know I'm not alone. I feel bad when you see all these radiant thrilled pregnant women (one in my office) and I'm just...not. I thought I would be but I don't enjoy any of this.
offmychest,fh7kpph,t1_fh6stgr,1581336284.0,"My great uncle married his ""second choice"". My great grandma died when my grandpa was 13 and his brother was 11. Great Uncle Dick (really his name) was upstairs in bed very ill. My grandpa came home from school and found his mum dead in the corridor. He was so close to her and loved her so dearly. Anyway back then many men just remarried so there was someone to maintain the house and look after the kids. He chose an absolute witch who was quite a lot younger than him. She really was the wicked step mother. She was very bossy, a bully and liked to be in charge. If you've ever read Matilda, think Mrs Trunchball. 

Great Uncle Dick fell absolutely in love with a girl who grandpa told me was perfect for him. They really were very happy. But she wasn't timid. She would speak her mind, politely, but was not going to be bossed around by evil step mother. So Evil Step Mother ensured great grandpa delivered an ultimatum to Uncle Dick. Break up with her or we will leave you out of the will and you will not have any part in the family business. Uncle Dick sadly followed the instruction. He ended up marrying the most timid woman I've ever met. She was one of twins, very sweet but also very shy and quiet. Her twin was the dominant one (side note: twin and her husband got divorced. She moved in with Uncle Dick and Aunt Alice till she was ""back on her feet"". Was supposed to be a couple of months. She never left. She continued living with Uncle Dick even after Alice died some 40+ years later. Alice was too timid to ask her to leave). Evil Step Mother could and did boss her around. I don't think Dick was unhappy with Alice but we all knew he really loved the other girl. Apparently he talked about her towards the end when he had dementia. He was back to being the age he was when he was dating her. I don't think he ever really let go of that flame. 

Grandpa was different. Grandpa met Grandma on leave during the war. She was actually engaged to someone else who she dumped for my Grandpa. They wrote to each other every day, we still have the letter he proposed in, amongst others. He told her if she accepted to go to his father's house to get the engagement ring, which was my great grandmothers and is now in my possession, (beautiful large diamond set in a cluster of smaller ones, over 100 years old. I wore it at my wedding). Never wear it, too scared I'll lose it! Evil Step mother met my grandma when she came for the ring and to meet her in laws. My grandma was a strong Welsh woman. She took no shit and was very strong willed and independent. Whilst she thought the meeting went well Evil Step Mother must have got a sense she wasn't a walk over. Grandpa was given the same ultimatum. Dump her or we're done. He chose Grandma. Never spoke to his father again. They struggled but did well. Grandpa had a great career, worked from the bottom and became very senior, travelled the world for work with Grandma right by his side. They lived in Dubai, Iran, Egypt, loads of places. Evil Step Mother actually visited them when they'd been married for 30 years and apologised. She was wrong. Said they wouldn't last 6 months but here they were, clearly still happy. 

Grandpa died last August at the grand old age of 98 with advanced dementia. He couldn't remember my grandma's name but he always talked about the wonderful girl from Wales who he fell in love with and her picture was on his nightstand till the end. He blew her a kiss every night. He really truly loved her with all his heart and I like to think there is an afterlife and they're together again, hopefully dancing in a ballroom like on the holiday when they first met."
BabyBumps,ffdcno5,t1_ffd6bqc,1579818065.0,"It's not that I need his permission to take it at all. I must have worded it badly as someone else thought I was saying that. I'm not the kind of woman who needs her husband's approval. I need to talk to him because the baby is his too and of there's a risk that's a risk that affects his child as well, not just mine."
BabyBumps,ffd0xgw,t1_ffd01n6,1579811246.0,"No one I have talked to has said it's a chemical imbalance so wasn't sure if that is the cause. They seem to think it's from everything going on at the moment. 

I'm in the UK and there is only one the nurse said he could prescribe to me. 

I have been told stress doesn't harm the baby but I do have a worry about all these hormones from stress pumping through my bloodstream then through the baby. I want to be happy so hopefully the baby is getting happy hormones too. 

Thanks for you comments."
BabyBumps,ffczh05,t1_ffcy9mp,1579810439.0,"It's not that I need his permission to take it, it's because there is a risk to the baby so that decision needs to be discussed together. It's not just my baby, it's his too. 

We communicate well and have discussed my mental health before. However he feels responsible for my happiness and right now he has a lot of pressure on. He already feels bad about the debt and a lot of guilt (his accountant fucked him over, long story). He doesn't want me to do much with the move and renovation so he's trying to do all that too. He's working extra hours to get more money. I'm worried about him taking on even more. He will see my happiness as his responsibility and I don't know how much more he can take at the moment. 

This pregnancy has just come at a really fucking stressful time. We wanted a kid, but in a year or so. We stopped contraception because I have been told forever that I would struggle and I would need fertility treatment. I went through many tests for a decade when I was being told this. We never expected it to happen after 3 months. If we were 6 months down the line, if we were in the house, if we had more repayments of the debt done and got some of it cleared, this would all be more welcome. 

I have another worry. The only medication the nurse says I can take can also sometimes make anxiety worse. What happens if that happens with me? I just have this feeling I may be better waiting until the therapy happens but I just don't know how to hurry that referral along."
BabyBumps,ffcvznm,t1_ffcsrw7,1579808417.0,"I think I would have to discuss with my husband before I make that decision. I just know how resistant he will be to me taking it if there's a risk and I also don't want to be fully open with him about how I'm doing. As I said he feels responsible for my happiness. He sensed I was off yesterday and kept asking and even said he feels like he's failing if I'm not happy, that it's his job. I reassured him I was good, just tired. 

A few years ago I was struggling with something else. I got help and massively improved. It was a self esteem thing. He said at the time that I wasn't strong, which I knew he was saying to avoid saying I was weak. I think he regrets saying that now though, it was in the middle of an argument. Since then though I've not wanted to show him any weakness. He said the other week that he hadn't realised how strong I was. That made me happy to hear that and I want him to keep seeing me as strong, despite me crumbling inside.

I can't take them without discussing with him and I can't discus with him without admitting I'm not coping."
BabyBumps,ffcvdsw,t1_ffcu2dp,1579808049.0,"I'm trying to get therapy. CBT was really bad move and made me much more anxious and stressed. My boss has referred me for counselling through work. Don't know when that will actually come to fruition though. 

The nurse who prescribed me the antidepressants is making me go back every two weeks to talk with him about how I'm feeling. 

I've had counselling before and it really helped so I'm hopeful the therapy will work when it comes through. 

Thank you. I'm glad someone else gets it and the whole feeling like just a vessel thing x"
offmychest,fe751aj,t1_fe5pj7f,1578910118.0,"To add to this, have you ever told your friends how much they mean to you? If not they may be thinking the same thing, thinking they don't mean as much to you as you mean to them. Just another way to look at it. 

If it's always about you being the one getting people together, making plans etc people will go with that as long as someone else takes that role. I actually had a chat with a friend a few months ago. I told her how it always feels like I make the plans and she often bails last moment. It feels like she isn't making any effort etc. She apologised, didn't realise she was giving that I pression and since then we have met nearly every week and she's the one who makes the plans or suggests something to do. Sometimes it's just getting the courage to have those conversations. No one is a mind reader so let them know how you feel and you may be surprised."
offmychest,fdmveem,t3_elxt3x,1578567614.0,"I've had this so many times. Now I wear a wedding ring people don't make the assumption I want more so much. What really pisses me off is when girls accuse me of it (to be fair the girl who accuses me is socially awkward and very brusk with people when she first meets them so that may play into her interpretation of my actions). You're nice to someone, make random pleasant chit chat at parties or whatever and even some women will accuse you of flirting. I'm a straight female but have been accused of flirting with females too. I don't understand when being nice suddenly meant you want to get off with them. People can just be nice with no ulterior motive! It's more enjoyable to try and find common ground and have a laugh with people rather than rebuff and be rude to anyone you don't know."
