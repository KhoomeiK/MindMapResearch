You’re a good person who did a bad thing. And you learned from it."

I just said he got something nasty, and I didn’t mind because he was nasty."

u_MiniQueen88,ffo76fm,t1_ffo7191,1580074836.0,I have reported you to admin. It's time to stop.
u_MiniQueen88,ffo5x8n,t3_eudauh,1580074451.0,"Your boyfriend is the creep who said it is toxic to call out a groper for groping, and you are the fool who stuck her nose in and continued after being told to stop.

Nothing either of you did was intelligent."
AskWomen,ffo32dl,t3_eud3qb,1580073581.0,"Either or, depending on the man.

Doesn't matter to him, since the end-result is the same: I'm not interested in talking with him."

offmychest,ffn43g9,t3_eu9ed2,1580061853.0,"Two replies out of two saying it wasn’t that bad.

- One of them explaining how it’s toxic to speak up against groping.   
- One saying “We’ve all been that guy.” 

I’m disgusted. This is not fucking ok. It was never ok.

OP fucked up, and feels appropriately bad about it. OP is being responsible going forward, and moderating his behaviour. That’s good. That’s what he should do.

Do not come here and say that what happened is ok, or that the woman or the other people exaggerated."
offmychest,ffn3g7t,t1_ffn2702,1580061624.0,"OP, do not listen to this person. 

It was never ok to do what you did. Women always felt violated by it. And yes, it is a bad thing.

It’s good that you’re drinking less, and that you’re determined to never act like that again."
offmychest,ffn0xrc,t3_eu8xd0,1580060858.0,"He is verbally abusive towards both you and your kids, and is refusing to get help.

Do you want your kids to learn this lesson? Do you want this dynamic imprinted in them forever, for them to repeat in their own lives?

You need to get safe too."

I need you to stop talking to me about other things than work. You’re greatly disturbing me, and it’s affecting my work, so I’m setting this boundary*”.

If he tries it again, say in a very clear voice “*please only address me about work related issues.*”

If you have a trusted coworker, tell them about it. If you have a gossipy coworker, tell them too. That way, they’ll all know you’ve had to set a boundary with him.

If he persists, tell your boss. You both work HR, so it should be possible to deal with."

Make sure she is constantly warm and not in a draft (from windows or under doors.)  
It’ll most likely pass within two to three days.

And, as with any weirdness, this is when you start weighing her at the same time each day, and keeping an eye on her for a week.

If she doesn’t get better, it’s vet-time."
AskWomen,ffiqksa,t3_etr2h2,1579980242.0,"Happy about it.

I never wanted kids, even though I wasn't adamantly against them.

I think kids should be wanted."

offmychest,ffi86hs,t3_etqgy1,1579967597.0,"OP, I’m going to advise the direct opposite of what you’ve been told so far.

Don’t push this. She doesn’t feel the same way as you do. If you were to keep trying, you’d lose her as a friend.  

I’m sorry you’re hurting."
