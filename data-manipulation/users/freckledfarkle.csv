AMA,ffhao3m,t3_et7pno,1579928078.0,"After day after my uncle commuted suicide I remember my mom telling me ""tomorrow could have been the greatest day of his life. Now it cant be."" The hard parts of life could have improved. He could have met the woman of his dreams. He could have won the damn lottery. But he has no tomorrows.
I am thankful you reached out. I am glad you gave yourself the potential to have the greatest day of your life tomorrow. I hope it is."
Advice,ffbgnmi,t3_esmlkp,1579764453.0,"Honey,  take a deep breath. Now take another. Say outloud ""She is going to be ok. I am going to be ok. ""

 You cant ignore cardiac issues. So instead she is getting it fixed.  That's a good thing. Yes there will be pain during recovery but it is all TEMPORARY. Remind yourself when you panic. Deep breath again. "" she is going to be ok. I am going to be ok.""
She will be in good capable hands. Talk to her nurses and get to know them. Be on the team with them helping her get better. If you panic let them know but don't take it out on them (which sometimes we do when scared). They can explain things that look scary, what's normal, what's not and what to expect. Deep breath. ""She is going to be ok. I am going to be ok.""
She's your mom and she will need your support before surgery. You need to be there for her then as she is there for you when you need. Like always. Moms are special that way. 
So one last deep breath. 
She will be ok
YOU will be ok"

CaregiverSupport,fecnvip,t3_eocleg,1578978644.0," Maybe you could use the reason its for the kids health and wellness . What if he has something (ex. Ringworm) he could pass to them that would be more harmful due to their ages? Sounds like he wont do it for himself, or you. But maybe for the sake of the kids"

Divorce,fe6je7u,t1_fe41mrs,1578892813.0,"I think knowing others are in similar circumstances helps. I also think venting to strangers online is a way to decompress and express your true feelings without worrying or burdening a family member. But best of all I see people who were where I am today and they are on the other side. They survived divorce, made peace, their kids are adjusted, they found themselves, met someone new. That is what gives me the most hope looking ahead. Hope it helps you too."
