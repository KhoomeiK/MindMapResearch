Mommit,fh01fmr,t1_fgypg3w,1581199624.0,Sadly mine is a girl... idk how to judge when shell pee since nothing to stick out. Since then shes peed on daddy a half of dozen times... me I learned my lesson quick

Parenting,fgv265w,t1_fgv1vjc,1581135030.0,True and sadly due to matitis and engorgement issues I'm pumping exclusively atm. I'm trying get my supply back before all that happened I was at 3 oz a hour. Now I'm getting 1 oz a hour pre breast. Mind you two ages ago right gave me 2 oz hour and lefty none at all

predaddit,fgtobzr,t1_fgtf04a,1581107278.0,"Yeah sadly people dont talk about it. But on the bright side when you've dealt with it, once you're through everything is so much sweeter. I wont lie I'm happy for the sleep depraviation. The little has smiles make everything worth it"
predaddit,fgtbvet,t3_f0ei2m,1581102256.0,"I can relate. And honestly it's so nice to see you are so happy now :)

My husband and I suffered a few losses before our rainbow baby was born six days ago. And wont lie it was not a easy road. 

Just remember one thing. When you get what you strive for after loss it makes it so much more precious. Love that baby with every ounce and remember to tell your wife she was a warrior through all that hardship."
NewParents,fgt82nb,t3_f0cr9v,1581100742.0,"I used the plates colic bottles, they have removable liners that you can sqeeuze out all the air. In addition to enfamil genteease formula. With my first she had colic and started cutting teeth at a month old. This eased the colic. I also tried many burping styles and used little remedies gas relief drops. 

I'd disengage feeding every half oz to burp. I also liked to lay her on the bed and do bicycle motions with her legs as it helped break up the gas enough to burp her better. Every fee bottles I'd mix the gas drops into it so as she ate she got the medication. And I became very vigilant with spit up if it started increasing I'd pull back a little on how much I feed her like I'd cut her off a half oz sooner.

I also made sure she had bowels movements if her stomach was hard my ped told me to take a rectal temp so to help her poop (be careful they poop allot and fats with that) and it gave up more space. And allowed gas to be expelled easier. I hope this helps!"
Mommit,fgt2vge,t1_fgt2tt1,1581097902.0,Yeah figured that out as soon as that happened... lol
Mommit,fgt2ski,t1_fgt1ztw,1581097853.0,"Yes when I asked daddy to get her things 9/10 they are dinosaurs things. She seems to like the dinosaur better then the pink and the more ""feminine"" animals"
NewParents,fgszzg2,t3_f0akc6,1581096184.0,My first daughter slept 8 hours a night from day one. The doctor was so mad for me not waking her up shed also eat 5 to 6 oz a feeding when she was up. He told me for restrict her. She was in the 97th percentile for growth. With my second I mentioned all this and how I started waking her up every two to three hours per the first doctor orders and restricting her feeding. My second daughter pediatricians said it's okay once there a couple weeks old to let them sleep and as far as eating feed them as much as they want so long as they make weight gains and pass urine and stool it's fine.
TryingForABaby,fgrdi33,t3_ezxkbq,1581044151.0,"Honestly I terminated a pregnancy at 16 for reasons of just not being ready. At 19 I was taped and ended up pregnant besides plan b and aging I choose to terminate. Well with my first i had 2 miscarriages before her. I had a extremely hard pregnancy with her i blame all this on the fact i had terminated previously. When me and my husband got together i ended up having a miscarraige and quite a few chemical pregnancies. I was told over the years kids were out of the question for me. 

I finally got pregnant with my daughter born a few days ago. The entire pregnancy was rocky. And after so it's been more so. But with my doctors I've come to find out I'm fertile. My terminations are the reasons for all my problems conceiving. In fact I actually had a few things wrong with me that caused all the issues. And they could be treated but made things very hard and were completely unrelated. 

I remember trying with my husband and how I'd get pregnant only to have a chemical or miscarraige and how I blamed myself.  You should be fine and if not find a good doctor. Have bloodwork done. It took seeing five doctors to find out I had mthfr and that untreated caused all my pregnancy loses"
Mommit,fgrbs1f,t1_fgra592,1581042965.0,Exactly it sounds so unbelievable...
pregnant,fgqfbir,t1_fgqeubh,1581023085.0,"I hated how people disregarded my pregnancy thoughts on parenting. Honestly one like one have changed and even if they all had it's my child and my feelings dont disregard them. The one thing I say is I'm 5 days post and frankly people disregard you more after. 

I have severe matitis and cant sleep or breastfeed from it at all atm and everyone says I'm crying cause I'm emotional. Or they tell me I have to breastfeed."
pregnant,fgqc4pv,t3_ezrxy0,1581021544.0,I mean I'm against co sleeping. Baby arrived and I wont lie its tempting but having a baby celebrate there first birthday is more important to me. It gets hard not to sometimes cause your sleepy the babies all cute and sleeping you dont wanna move. But I say if you feel that way now you'll probably feel that way after. I was a hard no about before. And through it's harder to say no I still believe it's best for her safety

ScienceParents,fghat0r,t3_ewuqnl,1580780667.0,"That's stupid. When I was in the hospital having my baby two days ago there wasnt nay. Theyd kindly inform you not to sleep while breastfeeding... the same night my daughter was born another baby was the mother fell asleep breastfeeding dropped the baby and it fractured it skull. Its stable and in the nicu but the nurses hadn't mad eit over to formally tell her the dos and don'ts. Had posters been places it could've been different.

Honestly I'm still so sad about that. And i. So scared having been so close in protimixity I refuse to breastfeed even slightly sleepy unless my husband is sitting next to me poking me constantly just to make sure nothing like this happens."
Mommit,fgha7e9,t1_fgh9vn8,1580780274.0,Ahh. I do wonder if I breastfeed and pump like how often to pump and how often to feed. Right now I know its suppose to be 2 to 3 hours but at 2 she isnt hungry but I'm in pain so could I pump a bit at 2 then feed at 3 mark
Mommit,fgh9r5z,t1_fgh9m7t,1580779981.0,Ibclc? Idk what that means lol. As for experience anyone has more then me I havent done this before so handy.
Mommit,fgh96ax,t1_fgh8rnf,1580779603.0,"Thank you so much. Someone mentioned warm baths so I took one where I laid on my tummy boob submerged for ten minutes until they weren't painful not to touch then I started to hand Express enough out I wasnt in misery. I wanna pump. The hospital said not to do it all for the first two weeks. But when I skipped the feeding I didnt know about the needing to pump what she wouldve gotten so that's helpful.

Thank you everyone here do to your advice I'm still engorged but I'm getting it down slowly so I'm not feeling like a unmilked cow. I really appreciate it"
Mommit,fgh1pjw,t1_fgh1dv6,1580774599.0,When I pumped my engorgement got 10x worst as I ended up going from like a normal amount too much. I might have a blocked duct . Idk its painful.
NewParents,fgff3pn,t3_exxhs8,1580736880.0,"Babies have to cry a little. It helps with lung development. The baby can cry a few minutes without you being a horrible parent. It just helps with the lungs. You're husband needs to not be a asshole. You need to shower you need to relax a little sometimes even if baby is crying.

If you're anxious baby will only be 10x more anxious the feed off emotions."
pregnant,fg4c2w2,t1_fg3z78j,1580500577.0,False kind sir. They dont let you go past 42 weeks without inducing or csection cause like itll kill you.
pregnant,fg45tmh,t1_fg3kjrj,1580496768.0,"Exactly. Im Being induced tonight and everyone keeps asking ""are you ready for this"". I just reply I wanna turn back time. Not because I dont want her but because I'm scared so scared. Inside I can protect her from everything once that's gone idk I have to guess and be wrong half the time to her needs and what shes feeling and frankly it scares me."
pregnant,fg2sw8d,t3_ewgmd3,1580454514.0,"Honestly I'm to be induced tomorrow and I'm terrified. They've mentioned csection is where I might end up do to complications with my pregnancy. I've had surgery and dont mind it. If I'm knocked out. But I'm terrified of being awake while they have me open on a table.

I have many mental health issues to and I'm a nervous wreck from it all. Seeing this helps a bit with my fear of csection but wont lie still it makes me super scared."
pregnant,fg2r1fa,t3_ewh46t,1580452483.0,"I'd add I vow not to judge if sometimes you hate pregnancy and are scared of having a baby especially if it was planned. 

My baby is planned. But I'll be frank I'm scared shirtless atm shell be here soon. My family is getting mad remarking ""what did you expect you wanted this."" I do I'm just frightened."
pregnant,fg17url,t3_ew8fzz,1580422426.0,"My doctor said a deep tissue massage from a person is fine... and that's wayyyy rougher and I'm super high risk and 40 weeks pregnant. Fuck that woman. Mind you if you get a person doing it I'd advise for a prenatal massage since they know how to properly massage a pregnant woman. 

But it's a chair. People just dont know when to stay out of things. Someone commented recently they were glad I was holding off on getting my monthly massage so I dont hurt the baby... I'm only doing cause I'm so cause to labor I'd prefer not to be there for five minutes of my hour and break my water all over everything and waste my money..."
pregnant,fg1764l,t3_ew83hs,1580422066.0,"Babies dont stay up and cry all the time at first. My first the doctors came running into he room day three because she hadn't cried at all. Nah she was tired and happy. Got her home shed sleep through the night if I let her the first week or two. After that she got colic and didnt sleep hardly at all for three months. Rest now just in case. I learned the hard way. I thought oh she wont be like all those babies you hear about I'll just resume as normal... when hell week approach I was tired within a few hours. And exhausted for the rest of the few months it went on.

Through the baby might not cry much. Who knows. Just prepare for the worst hope for the best. Honestly think about the fact their world went from very small to very large. Its traumatic even the best of births to be born."
pregnant,fg16mwc,t3_ewa29m,1580421771.0,"Honestly it happens. Me I got really depressed the other day. I wanted some... ""special time"" with hubby before baby is born since I wont feel like it for at least a month. We get into he stops and says he cant. I feel like so unsexy. Took a mental breakdown and me feeling like a giant whale for him to open up to me that it wasnt me he finds me sexy as ever. But the baby is head down and was hiccuping and it just killed Ditka for him... hope not to Tmi. He then went on to say he wants to hold em and have all the intimacy in the world but the bigger I get the more he worries about hurting me. About me being uncomfortable and about the fact ""theres not much room in there anymore"" so shes taking up more and more space and it makes him feel weird to be Intimate with his child right there"

At 28 weeks she went from a statue to a being it throughly convinced is hell bent on insuring all my internal organs are left bleeding upon her exit.

I only quit my job because my husband nearly divorced me cause at 32 weeks pregnant I'd go in anytime they called me in and when they refused to listen to me about I shouldnt be on a 12 ft ladder I just compiled. Obiviously my parents forcing me to never miss a day and telling me the teacher was always right has done great things.

I'm totally sarcastic. I completely agree. I also think spongebob helps this. It teaches kids to not care about driving. To be happy with working a minimum wage job and to suffer in unworkable conditions. I'm taking a lot of steps to get better with not making work my end all be all but all that's been taught to me make it hard."

I figured maybe 5 or 6. But for now i want her to be encouraged to pretend play and have a imagination. Well shes 5 now. And she finally got a tablet. I hate it. But the time shes allowed to play I'd highly limited. 

I will say I hated the idea. But theres a few pros like the fact theres some good apps out there for education. She was behind in speech and reading now shes excelling. Also nice to have something to take away. Because when shes fussy if I take it away she instantly behaves. I still wouldnt go back and change a thing.

When you're dealing with a colicky baby it's so easy to not ask for help and merely just not eat because you have energy to cook.

We got married shortly after. I'm now sitting currently 40 weeks pregnant with our child. It was hard. I've been judged for meeting him here. Moving so fast.

She went to full formula a special prescription kind. Well she developed the world worst colic. To add to this I'm a horrid insomniac. I had no one to help me at all. It was me and baby all day everyday.

Add to matters my first decided at 2 months old that's when shed start cutting her first teeth. I swear to God she didnt sleep for the next three months. People were always like ""shes formula feed you should be nice and rested"" ... no no I wasnt I remember waking up and going on a hour a day. Even when i did manage to sleep when she did the tiniest thing woke her up instantly.

If i decided to stay up and do a few things I'd been neglecting i got so much crap. Had people tell how easy it is if you dont breastfeed. At 5 months old she had most her teeth and colic started going away. She finally slept more then ten minutes at a time. Life was hell.

NewParents,ffnz6nn,t3_eu5nx8,1580072525.0,Another tactic. Is get your wife to calm her. Once she us have her hand her to you but still over her hand or have her hand on the baby then slowly reduce her physical contact. Once physical is gone have your wife stay close talking. Slowly transition your child to you. I found that helps if a child is more attached to one parent then another at any point. Because they realize mommy not gone daddy just here until she gets back in the room
NewParents,ffnykh1,t3_eu5nx8,1580072301.0,"Honestly with my first I learned one thing. I was mommy and she did want me. But when I was anxious and guilty she fed off that. Babies have no sense if self. It sucks. But with mine what helped was getting to a calm and relaxed mood then handling her. I noticed when I wasnt consumed with grief over being a bad parent she seemed happier because I was which in turn made everything better.

Mind you I was very curvy beforehand but I hate just how skinny besides where the baby is I'm getting.
pregnant,ffk81q4,t3_etyam8,1580018489.0,"Hun I get that you may be happyish most the time. But this has gotta change. This is how I was with my ex. I ended up raising my first daughter with him for five years. The entire time he worked from home. While I did everything. While working from home and never leaving the house he managed to spend roughly a hour a week with her. And just doing fun things at that.

I changed every diaper. Made every meal. Cleaned everything. By myself. When I'd try and talk to him hed get mad and say similar things. I didnt realize just how unhealthy our relationship was until I left. I didnt know that normal people dont just move in their brothers family for you to also care for while tending to a newborn. I honestly didnt know a man could be helpful or even appreciative.

Then I met my husband. Here we are expecting his first my second child. He spends more time with my daughter then he bio dad ever has. He talks to the unborn babyeveryday. He listens to what I have to say and actually thinks on it. I told him I dont want his mom to be all up in my business. Guess what he will not let her now, because as he sees it its disrespectful to me.

I know where you're at. I've been down a similar road. I'm not saying leave. Just somethings gotta give. If this is how life is now, how will it be when theres a child that adds ten times the work and effort? Understand you're a strong mama. Just stand up for yourself. Put you're foot down. Stop making dinners all the time. He drops something on the floor, leave it. Trash overflows men his problem. I'm not saying forever but this is the most tiring time in pregnancy. Quit waiting on him hand and foot and put your feet up and relax. Hes a adult he can figure it out.

As for the mother in law. Put your foot down. Just tell him if she stays then she plays by your rules not his. Cause if shes coming to help you then you have a say in how. It's not help if it stresses you out even more. If you wanna spend the day in bed just cuddling alone with your newborn while shes there then do it. It's not your job to do everything for them and just have them get whatever they want from you. Only th UK ng that matters now and for the first few weeks is you and baby is happy regardless what that means"

Or ""it takes a village"" one more time imma stab someone. Mind you they are all nice and stuff but I want us me, the baby and my husband to be a family first.

Idk about you but theres so much pressure being the first. It's like all eyes on you. I feel like anything once she is born I do will be sanitized."

He told me I must ""be dealing with the post baby hormones"" igl i almost went to jail for murder that day.

When he replied he was all ""but if I stop what happens if the baby arrives now? Shell be crawling in this"" I of course was like ""I'm 30 weeks and they dont come out crawling"" that was a few months ago.

Hes only gotten worst. But now I know just let him clean. Helps him feel like he is doing something."
pregnant,ffiysz6,t3_etuvh8,1579986064.0,Mine dont feel like that. But if theres a slight breeze they get so hard its painful for hours. I found heating pads if that happens and a little lanolin cream helps. When I get burnt sensations wearing a tighter bra helps a bit.

TryingForABaby,ffiy6qb,t3_ets35z,1579985620.0,"Get a new doctor. Whether or not shes right doesnt matter. In this journey you need your providers to be supportive and understanding and not have the bedside manner of a child.

You are right to feel disappointed. I got told for years that I couldn't have kids. When it came to trying I suffered many miscarriages. My doctor at the time said ""see you can have kids you dont need help"" took switching to find out I had a issue that left untreated would guarantee everytime I'd miscarry.

Idc if it's been 6 months or 10 years you have a right to feel as such. Me I went crazy. Every month if my period was even a hour later then usual i was in the bathroom with tests staring at non existant lines. It took alot out of me. Put hardship on my marriage. You deserve to feel like it ok to be disappointed. Ttc is such a hard journey. Please get a second opinion."
Parenting,ffilrci,t3_etpm2u,1579976912.0,"That's great. Honestly when it comes to fellow mom friends I struggle. So many mom near me have very different ideals in raising children which makes it hard. When I believe in vaccainations but they believe in probiotics and essential oils instead hard to find common ground.

I'm in school and recently I tried to befriend the only other women there pregnant and with children. It was a disaster. We vibed slightly but she asked me something about my birth plan when I answered honestly she got super mad and defensive. Even through I dont really see why. If she said said something I didnt agree with I'd ask why shed do something like that is there research I could see in case it's a good point I never thought of.

I have my husband whose my best friend. And my bestie is a dad. Hes cool and down to earth. I tend to meet people in the area I'm in that believe in helicopter parenting. I never knew until having kids how much they impact friendships. Because if another is very opposite in parenting style it's a struggle to make a friendship work. 

I'm so happy you've got some roots with someone. Imma have to try again to make mommy friends once I'm no longer whale sized with my second. Thank you this gave me hope."
unpopularopinion,ffhmml8,t3_etknhf,1579942580.0,"I'd rather be a wife in the 1950s personally. Just because it was hard work but unlike 1900s I wouldnt have wake five hours before breakfast to have it prepared in time. Plus 50s I loved how women cooked and clean but were also allowed to be educated. 

I agree with you're ideals. I just even if a housewife would be very unhappy without knowledge. I like the fantasy of how the 50s you went to college and got married afterwards. Then became the hardworking housewife that could also help the children with their homework because you had a higher education then women were allowed decades before. Getting my husband a martini and slippers. When everything is clean and children are at school doing things like junior league and book clubs. 

50s are when men and women alike filed their partners more then today. They didnt hide behind screens. When your man was upset he came to you to vent and for support. Them were the days"
pregnant,ffh8uuu,t3_etjql0,1579926449.0,"I feel ya. I got check a week and a half ago I've been having contractions 20 minutes apart and been at 4 cm for a week now. The last two days they are down to 10 minutes apart I'm at 5 cm I've finally shortened. But igl my husband has been getting my furry from constant pain. Everytime I go to the doctor that darn jiggle the hospital plays when a baby is born goes off two to three times and I break down.

They refuse to accelerate my labor told me itll accelerate on it's own. But when I go in for a appt they all are shocked I'm still pregnant. They will induce next fri of she doesnt come on her own. I'll tell you this. Be kind prolonged labor is ass. Either my first it took 5 days of induction and contractions to give birth. It was hell."
pregnant,ffh8fsc,t3_etk5qn,1579926088.0,"I feel ya. Honestly my mom would hang up or declare the baby wouldnt be her grandchild until two weeks ago. Anytime I mentioned the baby shed quickly end our phone call. I'm 40 weeks. Since she is finally accepting the fact me and my husband are having her grandbaby she just goes on about how she was pregnant.

She even once went on for a hour about how I was born at the end she said ""I couldn't believe the fact a babies penis looked like that"" ... I sat there stone cold silent. She realized she wasnt even recalling the right birth but my brothers... if I try to mention what we are planning on doing she demeans it and puts me down. Frankly I just want my mom to hold me in this time but the way she acts I cant believe I even talk to her still."
pregnant,ffh84am,t3_etin0z,1579925815.0,"Cutting the cord with a special person in your life is nice. But understand it's not everything. With my first her father was a pos. He refused to listen. Left me in active labor told me ""better not have the baby while he was gone"" I had her five minutes after he returned after having resisted pushing for a hour. He had to cut the cord. Well funny thing is due to complications the doctor cut it and went about attending to her and I. 

It wasnt ideal. But understand this. Whoever you let in the room just make sure they love you and care for you. Whether or not they cut a cord doesnt matter in the long run. What does is your surrounded by love and compassion. That you have a hand you trust to sqeeuze. And that the baby is healthy."

Parenting,ffh5pws,t3_etfec4,1579923840.0,"I'd say therapy. These are red flags. You should look into those around your daughter. See when I was that age I acted the same. Whether or not this is the case these things do say ""help me please"" shes struggling with something and whatever it is she isnt handling it. Therapy is the best way to figure it out and help. 

You may never know what is discussed in her therapy. But let me tell you growing up with boarderline personality and bipolar. It helped so much to have it when my parents finally accepted my issues were bigger then they could fix alone.

I started just like this. I even opened up and asked for help. My parents ignored all these signs. It took at the age of 16 me attempting suicide twice in one week for them to accept maybe I needed some help. 

It's tough but take the early warning signs to get her what she needs. Because if you wait it could escalate."
Parenting,ffh58k7,t3_etg1g7,1579923464.0,"No. With my first I let my dad watch my daughter once. He had had a past with drugs but been clean for years. While watching her that one time he decided to relapse. To such a point when I went to pick her up a few hours later he was so fucked up he had vomited everywhere and fell into a coma for a month and half.

If I had any idea he was throwing nearly a decade sober down the drain I'd never have let him near her. She was luckily physically fine. But mentally she had nightmares for months afterwards. I had found her shaking him trying to get him to wake up. She was 3 years old. 

I'm telling you now. Idc if they are recovered they arent allowed near my child without me if in recovery. And without recovery they can forget ever seeing the childern.

I'll tell you this. I'm not a bad mom. It's taken me and my daughter so much therapy to get over that incident. But theres not a day I dont regret my decision. I still wake up feeling like the worst person ever for exposing her to that. Dont make the same mistake. Because if anything happens bad you will hate yourself for the rest of your life."
relationship_advice,ff9j07d,t1_ff9hqhg,1579714036.0,"Honestly you wouldnt know. When I've had issues with a neighbor I tend not to past experiences approach them if one is potentially violent or aggressive. Even if the other is sweet I worry about getting myself in a dangerous situation I go directly to the landlord. So they may have.

Even through you split it now can you pay it all? When I had issues with a roommate 8 years ago I had her thrown out when she put my life in jeopardy. She was on the lease. But when cops were coming a few times a month due to her becoming violent the landlord got tired of her crap. I had to pay the rent solely by myself. It hurt so much but i managed i got another job and struggled hard for like 5 months left on my lease. But i was able to not fuck my credit. It wasnt ideal by any means. I was safe. My credit was saved but that time in my life I'd never repeat.

You can find a situational. I promise you that. Just you may not have any one that you like. Theres always opinions just sometimes they are all very dreary for a bit. I know your struggling. You care for him but you cant stay and enable this behavior. I dont recommend you do. I've been with people that get slightly physical a couples times and I write it off. I finally left my ex that seemed to only get aggressive under the influence and high stress when within a month it went from a harmless excusable he didnt mean to type situation like 2 times and escalated to him nearly killing me 3 times in the span of a week.

People like this are wildcards and can get much worst really fast. Another thing is see if you can get womens agency to help you. Theres often free legal services for women in potentially threatening enironvements. They'll usually hear you out and give you advice based on your located as well as help you proceed in completing them. These services are best to help you with the best professionalism"
relationship_advice,ff9hj27,t3_esb693,1579713143.0,"How much of the rent do you pay? If you can prove you pay the majority and hed alcoholism and can afford after the the fact to solely pay the rent. If you cant break the lease maybe you can get the landlord to evict him until you finish out the lease. If hes being so loud and aggressive others nearby have probably complained. A landlord doesnt want some asshole that he gets complaints about. They just want respectful tenants that pay rent.

Maybe if you make the case you a good tenant and him not so much theres recourse to be taken there. You shouldnt live with Jim anymore. But if you cant afford to live look for a way to force him out. You're not the problem here his behavior is."
pregnant,ff9dudd,t3_esbrgn,1579710857.0,"Mine is simply get ""mom"" clothes. I love graphics tees and stuff. I told hubby the other day I need everything to have shoulder pads.

Also find my ""mom voice"". I've been practicing in the mirror 'no dont touch that' 'why are you sticky I just cleaned you'  'dont eat dirt'. Its funny when I come out of the bathroom and family standing around wondering why the hell I've been saying the stuff in all different tones and pitches."
relationship_advice,ff9dcn4,t3_es8jy7,1579710522.0,"As someone that has overcome and dealt with these things personally. If my partner decided after they found out not to have sex even if they told me why and their afraid of hurting me. I'd blame myself and think its cause now I'm tainted. Even if rationally I know it's not true.

With me it was hard telling my husband about that part. I was afraid hed pull away and tell me I was gross or something. But it only helped us. Because when were intimate in times he notice I'd seem off or distant hed stop and talk he ensured I was comfortable. And he never questions if I want to stop or slow down. See when he found out he was like you not wanting to aggravate the trauma. But once we told it out he used the trauma to do things any way he could so I wouldnt be at all scared or taken back to the dark place I had been before.

Ask her. Be open. Be honest. Shell appreciate knowing you care so deeply for her and her feelings. You're a sweet man not many would be worried about the other person more then themself. So just be there."

I went and sat through it only because I care for her and it's her first grandbaby. I knew it was for her and that made it to table since if it was for me I'd have not done one at all. Plus side I got some awesome stuff for the baby. Downside 100 people  from my husband family there, most whom ive never met and having to be social with crippling social anxiety.

As for gender reveals. Had I found before my husband I may have done something cute to inform him. But a whole party is not necessary. 

A person I knew she had 4 kids. Each one shed have a baby announcement party (literally to inform everyone of the pregnancy), gender reveal, baby shower, then a meet the baby party after birth. She got so mad once when I said it was too much. 4 kids each having 4 parties. So close in age if you wanted her to see you as supportive you had to show up to every single one... when you add into he birthday parts for those kids and the ones she threw for herself and husband then christmas and Thanksgiving you never went more then like a couple weeks without a party.
