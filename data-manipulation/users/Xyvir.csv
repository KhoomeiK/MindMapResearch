hearthstone,ffhwkwq,t1_ffhtyj5,1579957133.0,"I think the problem is that the server just tried to 'guess' how long the client is going to take for animation and only ALLLLOTS(edit) that much time. Reason for this is that If the server always waits for the client to say 'im done with animation' it could be exploited somewhat by those modifying hearthstone, bad actors could make theoritical maximum 'rope times' even longer by waiting to send this 'im done' signal every turn."

Reddit and Facebook are at least private companies in the US, beholden to the US government for sure, but seperate entities with their own interests. my impression of TikTok is that it is basically just owned and operated directly by the chinese government"
bestof,ff698da,t1_ff6852z,1579622102.0,yeah but reddit and facebook aren't (directly) controlled by the chinese government.
