dogs,ff00n7m,t1_fevx1wf,1579463920.0,I know of a husky that tried to bury icicles in the furniture to eat later.
dogs,ff009x4,t3_eqpoak,1579463755.0,"Do they make locking butter dishes?

I had a dog once that managed to get ahold of a stick of butter, and was going to take it under the bed and eat it. We caught him before he could, though. The same dog also grabbed a head of lettuce (not same day) and tried to take it under the bed, but it wouldn't fit. Every other dog we've had sticks to normal canine foods, like remote controls and furniture."

AmItheAsshole,fevudp1,t3_eqq2fb,1579401623.0,"Very much NAH. If someone asked me how to help my child have the best life possible, I would be delighted. The fact that you're even willing to do this means you are a very caring parent, and your kid is very lucky to have you."
AmItheAsshole,fevtd3m,t1_fesegyj,1579401237.0,"At least when I was taking the bus to work, there was an unwritten agreement that you don't sit next to someone  unless there is no other viable option (e.g., handicap seating isn't an option if you're not  handicapped)."
AmItheAsshole,fev82ne,t3_eqlbl1,1579394311.0,"NTA, as everyone else has pointed out. Your MIL as given birth at least once, presumably without \*her\* MIL in the room. Shame she couldn't pass that same experience on to you."

dogs,fepj3xl,t3_epza1e,1579321812.0,">The love between a dog and a human is the most pure kind of love and it is utterly devastating to say goodbye.

This is so, so true. I lost the first dog I ever considered ""mine"" to lung cancer. He was four. We had the vet come to the house when it was time, and she had arranged it so that afterward, she let herself out so we could be alone. My husband and I clung to each other and cried, and I heard a wailing sound from somewhere and  realized I was making it, and couldn't stop, pure grief pouring through me. I still tear up when thinking about that day.

I am so sorry for your loss."

AmItheAsshole,fe6dobz,t1_fe4expe,1578887862.0,"NTA. Call her ""Liza""."
AmItheAsshole,fe65cv0,t3_ensbqt,1578882143.0,NTA. It's like a wizard being born to a muggle family and getting grief for that.
AmItheAsshole,fdzyuw4,t3_en5zxy,1578799108.0,NTA. Why couldn't she wait to take her shower until you got back upstairs? It wouldn't have been more than a few minutes.
AmItheAsshole,fdfw3bh,t3_el2ugv,1578371778.0,"NTA. If the dogs don't have a reliable recall, which appears is the case here, it's even stupider not to leash a dog.

I  used to live in a high-rise near downtown. I always walked my dogs on leash, as did most people. But one night I ran into a guy whose dog was not on leash. I said something to him about it (politely) and he responded that he could controls his dogs. I pointed out that his dog was about to cross a very busy street, and he said ""Oh shit"" and ran to catch it. Luckily nothing happened. But I never saw him without a leash again."

dogs,fcm6hc3,t1_fckdomm,1577765479.0,"You said it better than I could have, and I totally agree with you. I used to live in a high-rise and had to take the dogs down in the elevator to walk them. Someone asked me ""So you have to take them out every day?"" and I said, without thinking, ""No, I *get* to take them out every day."""
