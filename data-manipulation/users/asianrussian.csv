todayilearned,fdzt0er,t1_fdzsaal,1578795101.0,"Thats awesome! I’d be proud too! I am a mom of a very bright girl who turned 2 a month ago. She started talking at 6 months, counting by 13 months old and knew her colors, shapes, numbers, and alphabet by 1.5 y/o. Now she knows all of US presidents, and learning US states and World countries. 
Big Marvel heroes fan. 
It’s tiring sometimes to answer her questions, but it’s so fascinating how much she learns. 
Today she translated two words from Russian to her daddy. Lol."

todayilearned,fddib1g,t1_fdcpl1p,1578313431.0,"You are welcome. I forgot about nipples. They hurt like hell in the beginning when breastfeeding. Especially if the kid has a tongue tie like mine did. It hurt first 8 months. 

I honestly don’t know how and why people birth multiple children."
todayilearned,fd40r0c,t1_fd2yjdu,1578163323.0,"He did do everything and still does the big chunk of house chores. 
After childbirth you bleed for about 6 weeks. When the milk comes in, you get extremely fatigue and have uncontrollable hunger at the same time, because you are the only source of food for 8lbs baby who grows an ounce a day just on that milk alone. In the beginning babies eat anywhere between 8 to 12 times a day around the clock and each feeding takes somewhere between 15 minutes to an hour depending on different factors. Babies pee and poop about dozen times a day too. 
On top of that it hurts for you to sit and walk and move because your vagina is a gaping hole that’s bleeding non stop at that moment and you might have postpartum hemorrhoids and stitches from childbirth. Or hole that’s been stitched up from c-section."
todayilearned,fd3y7gf,t1_fd3a9kg,1578162672.0,"First few months really opened my eyes about childbirth. I was almost gestational pregnancy. I have 4 younger sisters and 3 of them had kids before me. Everyone around me had kids, but I couldn’t believe no one told me how it was going to be those few months after childbirth. Between making milk, uncontrollable hunger, lack of sleep, bleeding, hemorrhoid and stitch pains, like what the actual fuck was all of that? Lol."
todayilearned,fd3x6it,t1_fd2ypfh,1578162380.0,Thanks. Lol. Someone commented that it’s a good metal band name. I suddenly feel accomplished. Haha
todayilearned,fd3wytq,t1_fd3cy8b,1578162319.0,I did cut her fingertip once. It was so upsetting. She was sleeping and whimpered for a second. Ever since I do it  only during the day when the lighting is good.

todayilearned,fd3w4n0,t1_fd39p47,1578162170.0,"It’s a big big factor. My friend’s ex would hold their baby for just a few seconds and if baby made any sound, he’d tell her to take the baby, because he’s fussing. I never understood that relationship. 
I also have friends who have to fight their husbands so they do stuff around the house. Fuck that."

todayilearned,fd3sbp0,t1_fd317ve,1578161264.0,"Haha. We’ve lost quite a few pebbles out of diaper. Now I’ll be laughing instead of freaking out when that happens. Thanks! Lol 

We are potty training now and she freaks out when I lower her poopy underwear and start taking it off.  I had pebbles all over the placerte other day when she was dancing around in fear of her own poop."

todayilearned,fd3pzed,t1_fd3m6fl,1578160663.0,"Sounds so familiar! Lol. I moved out when I was 17 to go away for college. I knew my dad missed me, but he’d ged awkward and irritable if my mom handed him the phone. I’ve been away for almost 20 years now and he only recently started talking to me like a normal person."
todayilearned,fd2mldz,t3_ejwxed,1578149369.0,"Can confirm. My husband did all of bathing, changing, nail trimming duties the first few months while I was being a delirious milk factory. Two years later he is the one who reads to our kid every night for 20-30 minutes, cooks her favorite meals, and takes her to playground on weekends. He can do everything if I were to leave house for any amount of time. 
This is also cultural. 
I have a friend in her 40s, who is also a Russian immigrant in the US. 
The other day she asked me to tell my husband to babysit our kid, so her and I can hang out. I didn’t even try to explain it to her that dads don’t babysit their kids."
Unexpected,fcswtsk,t3_eiq571,1577927117.0,"My brother told me to double slap my friend who came to have a play date in first grade. I did it. She still doesn’t talk to me and I am still ashamed. 

Then as ab adult I double slapped a girl who really deserved it. It was at work. I could’ve gotten fired, but she was so awful that no one believed her."
