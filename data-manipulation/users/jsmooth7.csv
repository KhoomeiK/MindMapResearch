vancouver,ffgxldi,t1_ffgxc2p,1579917657.0,Kinda feels like you are saying exactly the same thing as me here. You have to take the weight of evidence.
vancouver,ffgp6df,t1_ffgojjd,1579911542.0,Yikes that's the worst drive to transit ratio I've seen.
vancouver,ffgmwnu,t1_ffgms5n,1579909951.0,Oh I'm not saying you should walk. I'm just wondering how the hell the bus is 3x slower than walking. That's pretty bad. o.O
maybemaybemaybe,ffgmdhh,t1_ffg1bhd,1579909592.0,The trick to getting a big splash is to pull one leg up to your chest and the other leg straight and then enter leaning back slightly.
vancouver,ffgkwec,t1_ffgjx2d,1579908593.0,"I'm not sure how you can argue correlation isn't at least some evidence for causation. Of course you still need to consider the weight of evidence and the potential harm of false positives. Even the most rigorous scientific studies can still sometimes have those. (See p-hacking for example.)

The reality is a lot of times, it's impossible to do controlled scientific tests so studies like this are just the best we can get. But that doesn't mean we can't get useful info out of them.

Quick edit: Realized I didn't quite read what you were saying correctly"

vancouver,ffg0fss,t1_fff8b93,1579895773.0,Correlation isn't proof but it can certainly be a piece of evidence for causation. This is especially true if there exists a clear mechanism by which that causation would happen.
vancouver,fffzh91,t1_fffuf5i,1579895182.0,I'm also curious. I know there are some bad transit areas but that's pretty extreme. Like a 5 minute drive couldn't be more than a 30 minute walk.

On top of that many places allow ""trans panic"" defenses that can make these murders perfectly legal. So if you want to talk about finding a better balance, those seem like a good place to start.

As for prison, to me this seems like more of a symptom of us not taking prison violence in general seriously. Like it's literally a punchline sometimes (""lmao don't drop the soap"").
