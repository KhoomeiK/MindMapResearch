holy fuck lmao

I've had my Switch for all of two weeks and I wash my hands before every use. I keep the thing clean as well. I know that everyone has oils, but if permanent marks are being left on my Switch after two weeks with me keeping clean hands, it's either Nintendo's fault or Satisfye's fault. Nintendo is at fault for plenty of other shit, but I'm going to give this one to Satisfye. Nothing about this grip is great, and I will continue to tell that to everyone so that they do not damage theirs.

Single best accessory. jesus fucking christ. It's not even the best **grip** let alone the best accessory. just wow."
NintendoSwitch,fbzp937,t1_fbzoz7r,1577254911.0,"Your idea that I don't keep my Switch clean isn't true in the slightest, so yeah, I'm not going to pay you any mind. I keep my shit pristine, which is why the PERMANENT mark on the back of my Switch annoys me. It's why I spent $50 on an authentic backplate replacement and the tools necessary to replace it. Can't wait til Thursday to get them."
NintendoSwitch,fbzopmc,t1_fbznqhc,1577254257.0,Can also recommend amFilm. Do NOT buy the Satisfye grip. It WILL damage your Switch!
