He asked why I didn’t tell him, how would I feel if he jammed all my things in a bag and didn’t tell me, and said it’s selfish of me to do that and not let him know. I said sorry yeah no I forgot that’s my bad, but I didn’t think you’d be getting back into my car anytime soon. 

He started getting shitty at me for saying that, and then I said something bitchy (at this point I was at mental capacity and had “blacked out” so I don’t really remember what I said but I know it wasn’t nice), to which he blew up at me and then I blew up at him in return because the night before I made points about how he’s always so critical of me and to just lay off me for once and stop blowing up so intensely. To which he said he’s tried being nice to me but has had enough of the bullshit. 

I said I’d had enough too and said that if he can’t just calm down and talk to me I’m leaving. He said fine do it I don’t care anymore and that I need to leave. 

I got in my car and sent him a message saying how he always says he’s the mediator of the serious talks and how when I want to have a serious talk he blows it off and carry’s on like a pork chop. 

He said oh just fuck off already. 

So I did."
offmychest,fffr0ea,t1_fffq3gs,1579889916.0,"We could never communicate. When we would talk afterwards about what happened it would feel more like a confession tape. I’d have to sit there and admit to what he said, even if it was truely awful. Like he’d say how selfish and ignorant and dumb I am and I’d have to agree with him or he’d get angry again. I would have to submit and tell him I was wrong and that I really am the things he says I am. 

He said from the beginning of the relationship he doesn’t care if he hurts my feelings telling me something I need to know, because he saw it as if he gets angry enough it’s make me realise that I’m the one making him so mad and I’d want to stop being like that."
offmychest,fffoh9h,t1_fffmsm3,1579888351.0,"He never really explained how it made him feel directly, it was always I’ve done something and it made him mad and I was a bad person for doing it. I’ve asked for him to give me time to calm down and collect myself but he refuses and would follow me if I left the conversation, he’d call it taking the easy way out and me saying I need to go calm down is me telling him to shut up and bottle up his emotions."
offmychest,fffm9el,t1_ffexxl3,1579887003.0,"That’s pretty much the plan, I feel bad for the circumstances it had to end though. When we weren’t at each other’s throats we’re best friends. We’ve done everything together for the last 4 years. I abandoned him with our sweet puppy and no way to go anywhere. As much as I felt like I was being used as a taxi service, I preferred being there to help him out more. He has no way to buy food, travel home, or transport our dog. He relied on me pretty heavily and I feel bad for taking that away from him. 

However, the day before I left he screamed at me that he’s never needed me and that he doesn’t remember the last time I made him happy."
offmychest,ffflq0p,t1_ffezkox,1579886679.0,"This is pretty much exactly what he’s told me. I can never accept defeat in arguments and will constantly try to one up him by saying something hurtful instead of critical like he tried to. 

I wish I knew what it was I’m attached to. All I know is that it’s a result of previous trauma built up over years of anxiety and repression. I’ve ignored my problems and pretended they aren’t there, thinking he’s the one with the problem, not me. 

The only thing I wanted him to change was his delivery, he would scream and swear and call me awful names and if I asked him to stop because he was hurting my feeling he would say he doesn’t care and that I deserve to feel a little upset for what I’ve done."
offmychest,fffl8ks,t1_fff025p,1579886380.0,"What I did wrong is not being able to admit to being wrong and accepting that I made a mistake , instead of pointing out the mistakes he has made too. He just wanted me to be a better person."
offmychest,fffl4pa,t1_fffc8hf,1579886314.0,"I think for my mental health it’s going to be better in the long run, it’s just so painful right now because we’ve lived together for the last 3 years and i feel like I’m lost without him. He was shitty but he had good intentions, I was shitty with none."
offmychest,fffktqz,t1_ffeylfm,1579886129.0,"Before the fight, I’d sleep through the night by his side but now I can’t sleep at all (it’s 3:15am now lmao)"
