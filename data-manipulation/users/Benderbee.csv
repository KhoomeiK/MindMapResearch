I may be 14 and acting unknowingly, but I don't know why it's one of the most popular roleplay games out there aside from Adopt Me or Royale High, nor do I have a clue on how many parents have been coerced. If I were you, I'd be using Roblox Studio for builds.

On the contrary, I think it's great you have the ability to both build up your architectural skills and help people while you do it. I believe people will request both qualities out of you a lot, so it's healthy for you to do this. I've tried to do the same thing in CloneTrooper1019's Welcome to Roblox Building, but I **1.** don't have any ideas to begin with, and **2.** it's all 4x4 blocks and basic wiring so my options are very limited. You're blessed with the abilities you gave yourself.

Wish you a great career!"

I find a brown-painted house with one of those room-like patios with screen windows and door in the backyard, and enter through. Once inside, I am surprised with my friends having a social. I join a table with my closer friends on the left side, the opposite side of the door. After talking for a bit, I hear a sound at the door. I open it to find a very short humanoid bear, no taller than 2 feet. I take him in, placing him in a shelf that is also on the left side. When I get back to the table, we begin to ask ""What are we gonna do with it? It could potentially hurt us!"" As we say that, we transform into Pokemon (mostly starters from memory). Then the dream ends. The only one I am certain was present was Froakie. Another may have been Chespin, and I may have been a Torchic.
