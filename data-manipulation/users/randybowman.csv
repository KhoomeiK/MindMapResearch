Ultralight,ffdp8kb,t1_ffcvo7t,1579825710.0,I loved frogg toggs on the AT. When it was hot and rainy I just let myself get rained on and it felt nice. When it was cold or cold and rainy the frogg toggs saved me.
Fitness,ffcj1si,t1_ffci6uo,1579800516.0,"Well she replied and made it sound like he does rest. He just doesn't time it or maybe he times it, but not with his phone."

Fitness,ff9gpi9,t1_ff9e0u7,1579712643.0,I use my phone to time my breaks. If somebody wants to judge me for it they can fuck off.

Fitness,ff9dlg3,t1_ff9d25f,1579710691.0,Lol. I just hang my headphones around my neck and turn them all the way up right now. Can't do that on my front squat days though. I'll get new ones someday.

Fitness,ff9ciiq,t1_ff9azag,1579709897.0,I need new headphones. Mine broke the other day so I used a twig and electric tape to splint them and they don't stay on very well anymore. I can't wear earbuds because my ears are badly cauliflowered.
Fitness,ff9cai7,t1_ff9b6y6,1579709726.0,"Make sure you're still getting 6-9 hours of sleep. Take caffeine too maybe. A lot of people start waking up early to do things, but don't adjust the time they go to bed to accommodate that."

Fitness,ff9c2jq,t1_ff9bndx,1579709562.0,I fuck around for 2-3 minutes between sets because I want each set to be good. Maybe he was just in a bad mood about something else though. When I'm in a bad mood I tend to be less excited for others. I'm sure he's still happy for you making gains.
Ultralight,ff6ytsy,t1_ff6wq32,1579637692.0,It's not worn because it's on the inside. Which is why I swallow and regurgitate my entire backpack every morning/night.

Ultralight,ff6swei,t1_ff6sgpd,1579634204.0,I prefer to put water in my mouth and lie completely still on my back with my mouth wide open. Then I bite whatever fauna attempts to drink from my mouth water. This way I don't have to carry any food weight.

blunderyears,ff39xgq,t1_ff2qkah,1579537110.0,I had a 8 inch mohawk and the glue couldn't even hold it. So I just wore it down all the time till I realized it's not really a mohawk if you wear it down. Maybe my hair is heavier than yours.
Fitness,ff2bm8t,t1_ff20h9u,1579499795.0,Some people may have bad anatomy or injuries that affect their range of motion. I like to squat down into a slav squat because I wear Adidas track suits on leg day.

bodyweightfitness,fedvgs8,t1_fedr445,1579020748.0,"Pullups on the monkey bars dude. 
Also get some resistance bands if you're having trouble and use them to spot yourself."
bodyweightfitness,fedohh0,t1_feddgak,1579016433.0,"I just do one or two vertical and horizontal pushing and pulling movements then any accessories I feel like personally. I have about 10 exercises for upper body day on the rings counting mobility and warmup. I super set them all so it's 5 and I'm done. Still takes a while. I do skin the cat/back lever for warmup, pullups/handstand push-ups, scap pulls/scap handstand push-ups, dips/rows, pushups/ytws, and if I have time curls/tricep extension. I take 2 minutes between super sets. I feel it's pretty beginner accessible as it's what I jumped in to from doing bjj and not ever really working out. The back levers took a while. I also do a muscle up negative to come down from every dip set to keep that party trick ready. I used to start every dip set with a muscle up as well, but my current setup doesn't really have room for that till the weather gets nice."
bodyweightfitness,fednunh,t1_fedbdcx,1579016028.0,I don't notice any difference in recovery from switching from rings to weights and back to rings. I'm sore the first couple workouts after the switch and then never again.
bodyweightfitness,fednqrw,t3_eojoam,1579015958.0,"So I'm a bjj dude who uses rings. They're helping me work out still after shoulder and neck injuries. Mainly because they're more fun than moving the tiny weights after losing so much strength. The core strength is definitely more of a thing. You won't get big legs without weights. Currently I do front squat/deadlift 3 days a week and an upper body rings day 3 days a week between work and bjj practice. The rings have given me back a greater range of motion on being shoulder locked after years of super tight shoulders. They're still tight, but less so. They haven't done anything for my neck, but seeing my bench and overhead press get cut almost in half after that injury was disheartening and the rings are a bit more fun for me right now in that regard because I get to relearn skills I used to have instead of reaching for numbers I used to have."

maybemaybemaybe,fe866am,t1_fe83xxo,1578922971.0,I think that's more nuanced. Like zoos perform a good service for conservation. If you were a zoo worker or paid the zoo enough they might let you.

I claimed I only needed a few hours. Which is true if I wanna just function. If I wanna be in my best health though it's not even close to enough. I think people just don't notice how the lack of sleep effects them.
