MurderedByWords,ffe1o1u,t1_ffdp7s6,1579834378.0,Yep. Paid $850 5 years ago for an apartment that currently rents for $1550
MurderedByWords,ffe1hob,t1_ffe0a6n,1579834254.0,"Let’s say you pay $1000 a month for insurance.  That’s 12k per year. It costs, on average. 10k to have a baby if you’re uninsured, and that’s labor and delivery only, not including pre natal health check ups,  complications, or after birth care. Got a concussion? 18k on average. Broken bones are about 2500. If you live in a bubble and never need emergency care and never have children and don’t have any health issues, it’s possible you would save money, but that would be the only way. 

Here’s an article that talks about how much medical things cost: https://www.guardiandirect.com/resources/articles/10-common-medical-costs-without-accident-insurance


Bottom line, as expensive as insurance is, it’s far more expensive not to have it, because no one is putting a cap on medical charges."
MurderedByWords,ffdzunf,t1_ffdzgh4,1579833068.0,"Sure. They’ll give you an itemized list of the amounts they charge for each test.  If you currently have insurance, go take a look at the paper they send you after your visit. It’s called an explanation of benefits and it should have a breakdown on it of how much the doctor charged, how much the insurance paid, and how much you paid. Then take the amount the doctor billed the insurance for and add 30%. That’s usually somewhat close to the amount that a doctor would charge a non-insured person."

MurderedByWords,ffdzani,t1_ffdwe1p,1579832663.0,"There is zero oversight or regulation on how much medical providers can charge for things. Insurance is essentially a contract between providers and insurance companies to offer services at an agreed upon rate. You, as the insured, pay for the privilege of getting care at the previously agreed upon rate between the insurance company and the provider. Without insurance, a $90 co-pay could be a $500, $600, $800 appointment. It’s disgusting."

She's put in time and effort training the dogs and caring for them. She's emotionally invested in them. I think you are underestimating how strongly she feels about the dogs because you don't like pets. From what you've said, it doesn't sound like she has any intention of hooking back up with the ex, and only sees him for dog related reasons. Trying to force her to give up something she loves (the dog) for you is not the move. That never ends well for the asker.
