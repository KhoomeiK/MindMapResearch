rant,ffdnjan,t3_esxse5,1579824661.0,"“The world is currently ending, but can we just cheer up?” - this is the best thing I’ve seen today. I love your way of thinking."
relationship_advice,ff5n9y9,t1_ff5hhp6,1579601454.0,"I’m so happy to hear that you broke free from the relationship! 

I would like to say that someone’s lack of motivation to get a job, or study, brush their teeth, shower, evolve etc, is a real concern for the future. Because it also shows that they won’t be very motivated to make you happy or motivated for when you have children. It says a lot about them as a person. Of course if they have depression it’s different, but I do believe that people should take very small steps of progress regardless of how long it takes. 

I was also in a similar relationship and he happened to be emotionally abusive. We met online after we had a wonderful few weeks of constant chatting and he had amazing photos. I met him and he looked nothing like his photos. He was only 25 but he had very poor oral hygiene and his teeth were covered in tartar. He wore the same clothes almost every day - in one year I only ever saw him wear two pairs of trousers and four tops. He also drank full fat coke several times a day and only ever ate burger and chips. 

I can’t believe that I stayed with him for a year out of feeling bad. I also don’t understand why people literally lose the will to look after themselves and think that they still deserve intimacy."
rant,ff4gvsn,t3_ergy0i,1579563311.0,I had the same issue. It’s illogical... I mean do they expect you to come up with a rocket science type question that no one has ever asked before and that the internet doesn’t have an answer to?
rant,femn2ze,t3_epv452,1579263273.0,I agree with you. Boyfriends and girlfriends come and go - it’s not like they are married. He might not like funerals or was even that close to her father! Most funerals last a few hours at best so it doesn’t mean he’s not there for her. He can be there for her the day before the funeral and once he gets back from the wedding.
rant,fekwjdg,t3_epk4bv,1579209070.0,They are cute because they are rotund and so sad looking that you just feel pity for them and want to look after them (if you could). That’s why they are cute.
rant,fek7za7,t3_epdz0c,1579194505.0,"I mean I recognise when I’ve been with my boyfriend for a 3 months, 6 months etc. We certainly don’t celebrate it. I’ll just say “oh how lovely we’ve been together for x amount of time”. It’s not a reason to have an ‘anniversary’."
rant,fei7849,t3_ep4smh,1579131830.0,"As someone else who has a dry skin related condition, I too have been the victim of constant pointing out. Like bitch, I already know? I can’t control my skin, it’s my genetics. I feel like picking out a flaw on them just to be petty."
rant,feezt35,t3_eongws,1579044854.0,What exactly is Tiktok for? Is it like Instagram? I almost downloaded it but didn’t want to pay haha! Seems I had a lucky escape.
eyes,fedbkfx,t1_fecy6g8,1579006719.0,Well in that case even better! Grey eyes are much more unique than blue eyes so you’re lucky. Of course all eye colours are beautiful though
rant,fedbhwy,t1_feci8gt,1579006654.0,Because it wouldn’t be patchy or look unnatural - therefore it wouldn’t look fake.
eyes,feawbyu,t3_emjzdx,1578952848.0,Very beautiful. The smokey grey ring around the iris really compliments the colour
eyes,feavdk7,t3_enlc3u,1578952547.0,Beautiful turquoise eyes! Like the Caribbean Sea...
eyes,feaupob,t3_eoaqab,1578952342.0,Beautiful eyes! Do you have another photo of you in low lighting? They are very similar to mine - they are medium brown in low light and then very light golden brown in the sun.
NatureIsFuckingLit,featnlj,t1_fealbz1,1578952126.0,Yes this is correct. I wonder why it perceives it as upside down and then tilts it up?Really intriguing
depression,feamnqq,t1_fe8t4ur,1578950344.0,"Sorry to hear that. I was in hospital after taking an overdose because my then boyfriend (abusive POS) told me that I was dumb and would never get anywhere in life. This really hit me because I was unemployed, had no qualifications and from a poor family. Even after telling him what I had done he continued to call me stupid and berate me. It just astounded me how someone could be so uncaring. I feel that a lot of depressed people are very empathetic and understand suffering. In fact what makes some of us depressed is that we feel SO much, we feel our pain and everyone else’s."
rant,feafd2w,t3_eo7eq0,1578948008.0,What a beautiful story. I’m going to have to follow your account for any more pieces of beautiful literature that you may have.
rant,feacfrk,t1_fe9tbwg,1578946974.0,"Exactly. There’s no ‘healthy tanning’. Just a slight tan is a result of cellular mutation. And it’s cell mutations that cause cancer... it’s a no from me! 

Plenty of women my age travel loads and bake themselves in the sun without a second thought. They look super hot while I’m a vampire, but guess what? When I’m 40 I’ll look 20! (Hopefully) lol!"
rant,feabup9,t1_fe8suub,1578946768.0,Do you mean real tanning? I’ve heard inhaling the DHA found in fake tan be cancerous. I’m not sure how true that is. I’ll  stick with fake tan anyway as it’s not as harmful as real tanning!
rant,feab9gq,t1_fe9sg9z,1578946555.0,"That’s really interesting. Do you have any mixed ancestry going way back? Maybe one of your ancestors was from a different region.

It’s amazing how people inherit certain random traits. If you look at biracial children (like Asian and white) some of them have pale olive skin, bright blue eyes, and light brown hair, whereas some will end up with all dark features. It’s incredible!"
rant,fea9qv7,t1_fe9r9sx,1578946038.0,"I wear fake tan but it’s light and not many shades darker than my actual skin tone. I think it looks ok if it’s not too darker than your actual complexion and isn’t patchy! Usually you wouldn’t notice the good ones. I do agree though it is crazy seeing people in the UK with dark tans in the winter! Dark fake tan looks ridiculous on pale people, especially people who have very light features - it looks tacky and unnatural.

The whole point is that it’s meant to ‘enhance’ your physical appearance, not completely change your appearance and turn you into a new person. The same goes for makeup. The good thing about fake tan is it’s not as harmful as real tanning! Real tanning isn’t worth the cancer risk, and it ages you like a banana."
rant,fduwc1r,t3_en03ps,1578739942.0,"Racism means the belief that one race is superior to another, or another race is inferior to another... so yes anyone can be racist, even to whitey believe it or not. That definition is literally along the lines of the Cambridge dictionary meaning. 

I don’t know why some of these weirdos commenting keep changing the definition to suit their agenda."
narcissisticparents,fdqe9gq,t3_emqrx6,1578664389.0,Why does she do this?
LegalAdviceUK,fdqe6mi,t1_fdlcfh4,1578664327.0,"Thank you so much! I passed the links on to her. Sadly she still feels really scared and has decided to pay it off and then leave once she no longer has ties with him. He never once apologised to her and still asks her for money even though she’s paying his debt.

I think it’s a stupid decision but I’m not in her shoes so I can’t really relate. Thank you so much anyway."
truerateme,fdky3pz,t1_fdgcvek,1578513542.0,"Exactly! She’s wearing lipstick, eyeliner, mascara and maybe even blusher? How is that too much makeup. She doesn’t look like a clown at all! Makeup accentuates features not completely changes them!"
relationships,fdjn68y,t3_eln496,1578479028.0,"Wait til just after the anniversary has passed. She could possibly be cheating and you want to be considerate and wait til after the exams!? No way - that’s too long! Confront her ASAP or it will drive you crazy.

Are you sure that those emails are recent, and aren’t old ones?"
news,fczdvha,t1_fcyuyc2,1578098988.0,What’s it like living at the Air Base? I travelled many times to Doha and loved it (a good friend moved there for a job) it was very different to here in the west but sometimes a change is a nice!
news,fczdmwh,t1_fcyhwz2,1578098840.0,"What’s it like being there? I used to travel a lot to Doha and always felt bad for the troops stationed there. It’s so hot and I wonder what you do for fun. Do you have to stay at the base or are you allowed to go around the city? I know I sound stupid but I don’t know anything about how it works, so I’m just genuinely intrigued. I loved Doha as a city though."
