Futurology,ffgp2yi,t3_eteahl,1579911475.0,God it’s like an awful snowball effect with driving I swear. Some schmuck up ahead going under the limit will in turn just progressively make that lane slow until it’s a dead stop. Like at some point it’s a detriment going stupid slow isn’t it?
Documentaries,fffe1ii,t1_ffegk0p,1579881910.0,"They were already losing players through WoW and Overwatch was losing its hype. Hardly anyone plays HotS, people are pissed about the Diablo games, and Hearthstone basically cut off its own legs then cried foul play.

It’s sad because I really loved playing WC and shit back in the day."
Documentaries,fffdslp,t1_fffcom2,1579881750.0,"I’m not saying it’s making a huge splash, but it’s helped many of us point our gaze towards the issue. Is it not important to bring attention to a cause like this, as much as possible?

Also, if people want to support HK in anyway they can regardless of how small it is, why shoot them down and laugh at them? If anything doing nothing is far more laughable."
Documentaries,fffdchy,t1_fff40y8,1579881470.0,"Well thank you for being (from what I’ve seen) the first Redditor to actually give a solution and even list multiple products not Chinese. For some reason, everyone likes dogging on people wanting to change this aspect of life. What’s so funny about trying to support a cause, no matter how small an impact it does? Doing something is better than doing nothing.

My hats off to you, fine person."
Documentaries,ffeggef,t1_ffeg65o,1579847048.0,"I’m an ex-long time player of WoW (since BC Launch, stopped after BfA) and I’ll be honest, even with all this shit I still contemplated playing after deleting everything.

Rose-tinted glasses don’t apply in just relationships sadly"
Documentaries,ffeg8ot,t1_ffedne3,1579846817.0,"Yes, but there are also plenty of other games that be been out longer by Blizzard. That was probably more his point towards, not just Hearthstone. 

Wasn’t initially clear though so I understand"
Documentaries,ffeg4n9,t1_ffedclu,1579846696.0,"That goes without saying. But to assume that OP couldn’t literally find other products NOT made my China is where the error lies, therefore my sarcastic comment.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like you can just cut everything Chinese made out without a very noticeable difference in general life. It’s not impossible"
Documentaries,ffecmz5,t1_ffebuqh,1579843209.0,"Probably the same way you did?

Sorry, /s because apparently it’s needed"
Documentaries,ffecka6,t1_ffe832k,1579843139.0,"What’s funny is that the fucking Blizz-tard brigade will trash talk all this China stuff, then go all in on downvoting and berating anyone who says they’ve deleted everything. Like I’m sorry, what steps have YOU taken in between your gaming for 11 hours and the other time spent on Reddit?"
AskMen,ffe91mi,t3_esruuu,1579840037.0,"I cook a lot and she knows because I cook all our meals (it’s my hobby plus I’ve worked as a cook so I don’t mind). She worked at Walmart so a lot of it was stocking where she could easily lose her ring. We’re fairly used to forgetting our rings in our pockets/keyrings/counters.

Don’t get me wrong though, I actually like wearing it cause I’m not with her 24/7 and I like some type of connection to my life partner."
DBZDokkanBattle,ffdo0fs,t1_ffdnvma,1579824951.0,"You right, the boy was shafted (and imo the viewers) by not getting to legitimately show that shit off after making such a big fuss about it during Cell"
DBZDokkanBattle,ffdnrwe,t1_ffdkqyx,1579824806.0,"Gohan is definitely my fav SSJ2. But not really on the same train of thought here, since he’s asking about Gokus specific achieving of SSJ2.

Gohan SSJ2 is probably my favorite scenes though. Fucking chills man"
DBZDokkanBattle,ffdnjxo,t1_ffdkw1i,1579824672.0,"You are correct in that he showed all forms to Buu and Babidi, but that was for sure after his Vegeta fight. I’m positive he achieved it offscreen though, since he mentions doing so while in Other World and achieving farther beyond that while there.

All for the sake of the Princes Pride"
DBZDokkanBattle,ffddhtm,t1_ffdd0eu,1579818587.0,"Which I believe was when he fights Majin Vegeta. And by then, he’d already achieved SSJ3"

DBZDokkanBattle,ffb0cpb,t3_eshcuc,1579748675.0,Oof. As a returning player this gives me anxiety. I’m so glad my hiatus payed off cause now I have legitimate reason to play again with all the content

gaming,ff8anft,t1_ff8afy0,1579671062.0,It is mostly because it’s literally unavailable unless you downloaded it before they took it off the store. One of this things that’s like “well now that I can’t have it I WANT IT”
gaming,ff8a7jo,t1_ff8a0bf,1579670642.0,"P.T. Was supposed to be a new Silent Hill game that Guillermo del Toro and Hideo Kojima were making. They cancelled the plans for the game, and the demo (P.T.) was taken off the store. The demo itself was already very good, so the fact it went away so suddenly made the demand for said game much higher, which led to people selling consoles with the demo on it for ridiculous prices online."
