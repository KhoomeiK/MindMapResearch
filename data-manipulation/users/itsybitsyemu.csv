AskReddit,femafja,t3_epu341,1579245915.0,"In high school I was at a summer camp. My group went on a 3 day river canoeing trip. At one of the campsites, the river had this little island with an eddy beyond it (where the water curls back and flows back up to the island). Everyone was taking turns ""riding"" the eddy, essentially going into the river and letting it take you and then you'd get caught up in the backflow and end up back at the island.

I've never been a strong swimmer, and so I was scared to try, but they convinced me. Well, sometime went wrong, maybe I was too small or positioned myself incorrectly, but I didn't get caught in the eddy and was suddenly in a very strong downstream current, barely holding my position by swimming as hard as I could. The lifeguard that came on the trip managed to get to me and get me back to the island. There were pretty strong rapids shortly after and I definitely feel/feel like I could have died. It was terrifying."

""(Name), remember to share with your cousin.""

""(Name), please use walking feet in the house.""

""(Name), I (cousin) would rather play alone right now.""

""Careful (name), that's hot!""


There is some merit to this parenting style, mostly in that kids understand better if given reasons rather than just being told no. But it takes a LOT of effort, and that isn't what's happening here. Your sister isn't caring what her child does and is going to end up with a spoiled brat."
