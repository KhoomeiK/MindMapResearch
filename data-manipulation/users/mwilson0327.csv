toastme,ffsxf42,t3_euzmh5,1580196464.0,You look like a happy person.
RoastMe,ffsxdba,t1_ffsf5oq,1580196399.0,B.I.N.G.O.  But tbh I would do the same probably.
vancouverwa,ffsxatf,t3_euxyix,1580196309.0,"I really hope they aren’t talking politics in my 4th grader’s classroom.  I don’t trust a teacher (or anyone) to offer an un-biased point of view.  I believe it’s best to leave political discussions to parents and leave teaching to the teachers.  I realize parents are going to be bias as well, but that is their right when raising their children."
JoeRogan,ffq58oy,t1_ff52doi,1580121202.0,I’m 5’9 3/4” and Joe Rogan is shorter than I am.
JoeRogan,ffq4yih,t1_ffhvze8,1580120748.0,Man...you hit the nail on the head.
AskReddit,ffpvon7,t1_ffps1vn,1580107505.0,That one doesn’t hurt me as much.  However if they say “I seen” instead of “I saw” then I don’t even give them an explanation as to why I’m never talking to them again.  Just completely ghost them.
unpopularopinion,ffprq8z,t1_ffoaahf,1580103334.0,"It’s a flex.  It’s like they’re trying to make some kind of point that they are above caring about rich people dying.  Which is ironic because on one hand they say that famous people are just people like you and me and aren’t special, but as soon as one of them dies...well suddenly they are special enough for them to feel the need to point out how special they aren’t."
AskReddit,ffprm46,t3_euawng,1580103224.0,If they pronounce the word “picture” like “pitcher.”  That’s a deal breaker.
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffobgsp,t1_ffmpjbh,1580075918.0,Nope.  You could do this montage with just about any NBA player.  There are probably a thousand high fives given per NBA game and there’s a lot going on so sometimes they get missed.  Someone just decided to put together a video to make it look like nobody ever high fives Hart.
books,ffoae6x,t1_ffn2b53,1580075691.0,"You’re right about the poor quality.  I mean, I don’t like to disparage anyone trying to follow a passion, but damn...I couldn’t get through most of them.  Such horrible writing."
books,ffo9xjl,t3_eu98yf,1580075526.0,"I have a “Cat in the Hat” book that is not particularly interesting except that it has my name written on the inside front cover in my grandmother’s handwriting.  That’s also not that cool except that I bought it at a second hand book store at the age of 32 in a town about 40 miles from my hometown.  I bought it, along with a bunch of other Dr. Seuss titles and kids books for my young daughters.

My grandmother is the person responsible for my love of books and my love of learning.  I had parents who could give a shit if I read or not, but my grandmother was constantly sending me books and she always wrote my name on the inside of the front cover.  Some of the books she sent me were educational books like National Geographic stuff and others were just really great fiction books.

Anyway, it’s just really cool that we happened to come across a book I owned as a child in a second hand book store and now my kids get to have it."

worldnews,ffnvr8o,t3_eu6o8o,1580071457.0,If he were a terrorist he would have played dumb when asked about his opinions.  The fact that he couldn’t resist giving his opinion PROVES without a shadow of a doubt that he is just a truck driver.  I worked in the trucking industry for 15 years.  Trust me...he’s a truck driver.

AskReddit,ffivjyk,t3_etohsu,1579983742.0,Silencers (actually called suppressors) on firearms do not suppress the sound of a firearm in real life nearly as much as it does in films.
AskReddit,ffhbm4l,t3_etcyd6,1579928980.0,"If I was laying on the sidewalk with a bone sticking out of my arm, people would rush to my aid.  I would have an ambulance there in no time and my health problem would be taken care of.  If I was standing alongside the road wearing my underwear on the outside of my pant yelling at a telephone pole, people would do their best to avoid me and they would laugh to each other about it.  Not all people would laugh, but enough do.

Is your brain not part of your body?  It’s literally the most important part of your body.  Almost any other organ can be replaced and some even completely removed.  Our most important organ in our entire body is the one we disregard the most when it comes to health.

First of all, we need to change the stigma and start taking mental health seriously."
HealthAnxiety,ffh5z5k,t3_et6ece,1579924045.0,"The first week I took Paxil I had really bad side affects.  The first few nights of taking it, I had horrible panic attacks and when I finally did get to sleep, I would wake up in the middle of the night soaking wet from sweat.  Like I thought I pissed the bed.  I suffered through 2 weeks of this before it started to level out a little bit.  Also, I would have another panic attack trying to get back to sleep.

My doctor believes we started me at too high a dose.  I didn’t tell him about all of this until a month into taking it and he scolded me for not letting him know right away."

BestOfOutrageCulture,ffe1n7a,t1_ffe19mf,1579834362.0,He just doesn’t like that two people from (possibly) opposing political views can have fun with each other.  We’re supposed to call each other names like libtard and neo-fascist or some shit.  Idk.
BestOfOutrageCulture,ffe1iec,t1_ffe1d45,1579834268.0,What’s wrong with not getting on me knees and sucking the cock of one political party while I completely disregard what the other one has to say?  It’s a pretty sad state of affairs when it’s an insult to label someone a centrist.
BestOfOutrageCulture,ffe11of,t1_ffe0xnt,1579833932.0,"Isn’t it fun to use extreme hyperbole to make your point!  I like ours better, but yours was pretty solid too."
BestOfOutrageCulture,ffe0qmp,t1_ffdzxsl,1579833710.0,"I’m sorry, James, I can’t help you.  I’m in social justice prison because I dead named someone.  I swear I had no idea that xed had transitioned from gender yelex to gender xed.  I’ve tried to plead my case, but the judge said as a white man I have no right to feel that I’m being treated unfairly.  

The SJW police stormed my house within minutes.  They said they were freeing my pet dog from the slavery that I had put it into.  I just received word that Brutus was euthanized at a PETA shelter for his own good.

So here I sit, strapped to a chair, being made to watch videos of why not recognizing alternative gender pronouns makes me worse than Hitler.  I’m starting to understand.  I am white and therefore I was born evil and I deserve this.  Also I’m a cis gender male...I think...I...I don’t know anymore.  They feed me hormones to kill the toxic masculinity inside of me.

Also, they told me that my wife and daughters have been freed from my influence that makes them believe that I’m a good person even though my house is a tyrannical patriarchy.

Please...if you ever free yourself, come and relieve me from this hell...by death if necessary."
horizon,ffdphr6,t1_ffdpc1w,1579825871.0,Ok thanks for that explanation.  Makes more sense now.
horizon,ffdo5m0,t1_ffdnpat,1579825038.0,Thank you.  I just need to be patient I guess.
horizon,ffdo3d9,t1_ffdnuma,1579825000.0,"Ok thanks man.  I think I’m a lot higher level than I should be.   I mostly ignore the main quest and do side quests.  I’ve explored the whole map, unlocked all of the tall necks and I’ve collected all of the collectibles and I’m a level 46, but my last main quest was saving Meridian from that bad guy Duv....something."
horizon,ffdnva6,t1_ffdnoja,1579824864.0,They must have changed something because it literally says I only need to place 2 power cells.  Yeah it feels like I’m not in mid-game because I have explored the entire map and done every side quest and errand available to me.  I’m level 46 and on a main quest that says level 18.  I just saved Meridian from that bad guy who’s name starts with a D.
BestOfOutrageCulture,ffdi66o,t1_ffd6ekp,1579821379.0,That’s a quote I live by.
BestOfOutrageCulture,ffcvq7y,t1_ffby4aw,1579808258.0,Be careful what you wish for.  You’re optimistically hoping social media obsession is just a phase that will eventually burn out and things will go back to less madness.  I’m bracing myself for what will fill that void if and when it does burn out.

When you’re single, you have less of that so you aren’t asking for more time off.  So...it just makes it look like they’re getting preferential treatment.  If you want more time off then just go ask for it."

JoeRogan,ffcjk48,t1_ffbmzrh,1579800822.0,"He’s right.  I would watch the show religiously if it weren’t for the audience.  As it is, every now and then I try to get through a particular episode because someone who I want to hear is on there and I’ll try to watch it.  But the applause breaks are so cringey and make me so uncomfortable that I never get all the way through."

He’s one of the few I haven’t seen live.  I’ve seen Louis CK, Bill Burr, Joe Rogan twice, and Dave Chapelle.  That’s my Mt. Rushmore of living comedians.  Stanhope is in my top 10 though.  Most recently I saw Chris Hardwick and he KIIIILLLLED.  Probably the most I’ve laughed in a long long time."

southpark,ffaptyu,t1_ff9wo8r,1579741670.0,"One of the things I hate when it comes to comedy is when people are offended when their thing is being made fun of, but they were laughing their asses off at the other people being made fun of.  I’m sorry, but you don’t get to laugh when the comedian is making fun of the handicapped people and then get all butthurt when he’s making fun of obesity because your weight problem is a sensitive subject.  Either it’s all ok or none of it is ok.  I use that example because I’m a great big fat person."
toptalent,ffaphia,t1_ff90mhv,1579741435.0,I always wait until the end of every episode to watch the part where the writers talk about the episode.  After the last episode they weren’t there.  They knew what they did.
unpopularopinion,ffaoec7,t1_ff8yp8o,1579740705.0,"I think it’s ok to be reminded sometimes that we have it a lot better than other people in the world.  It helps you maintain a healthy perspective when you’re having a bad day because of things like oversleeping, getting written up for being late, getting a flat tire...shit like that.  However, when real shit happens like death in the family, terminally ill diagnosis, etc, then stfu with it.  Sure, somewhere in the world there is a little boy with cancer who nobody loves.  It’s sad, but being reminded of this isn’t going to make anything better for you."
