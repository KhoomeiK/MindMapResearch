He didnt say protest. He said screaming and crying in public.

Why do I *know* someone is going to latch on to this?

All sarcasm aside, I couldn't agree more. There's no discourse anymore. If you're republican, you're an insane nazi that wants to murder anyone with dark skin. If you're a democrat, you're a communist that wants America lost to mass immigration and domestic terrorism. 

Fucking idiots. There's no discussion of common goals anymore. Politics is supposed to be about differing ways to get to the same place. Not a sociopolitical sword fight."
bestof,ffiwd0z,t1_ffiofk4,1579984304.0,"Id like to not be compared to a slaver or a murderer.

The comment makes the argument that we simply value differing things, but uses *murder and slavery* as the examples. As though what we defend were just as obviously reprehensible. 

Youre gonna go ahead and tell me my side of politics is so pants-on-head insane that its akin to defending *slavery and murder*? How can you not see how insulting this is? It demonstrates a clear desire to demonize anyone you simply do not understand."

At the heart of literally every subject is the question, ""Why?"". And that seems, to me, to be a distinctly philosophical question."

AskReddit,ffcvtpw,t1_ffcjbog,1579808318.0,"Social sciences are just group psychology, and what comes out of it really.

Actual psychology gets a terrible reputation. Too many college kids dont understand Psych 401 and go on thinking that it doesnt actually define human behavior. We arent that complicated, and we all follow rules. 

Psychology probably makes more sense to programmers these days than to biologists or physicists."
