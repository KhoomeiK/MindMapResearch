I used to browse 4chan while I watched movies. Then I started watching foreign films and had to concentrate on the film instead of my computer. South Korean cinema specifically really changed how I viewed what was acceptable. Haven’t been back to 4chan in like 7 years. I could’ve easily turned to the alt right if I had been a different person in 2015. Thank goodness that didn’t happen."

If you were unable to produce your academic pass to a faculty member, you were not allowed to hang out in the cafeteria, gym, or band hall before school started, because you were expected to go to tutoring with the teacher whose class you were failing. If your teacher wasn’t there early, tough luck. No exceptions were made. You had to find some other teacher’s class to attend tutoring for even if you were passing their class. Or you could wander the halls pretending to be on your way somewhere. 

I was a good student, but my academic pass, which was made from construction paper, would inevitably be left in my pants pocket when my dad did the laundry and I’d be out of luck until the next one was issued.

My dad ate at Herbert’s Taco Hut at least once a week back then. 

The growth has exaggerated everything. Back in the 80s, it wasn’t really sleepy, but it definitely wasn’t as busy as it is today. SM has grown exponentially in the last 20 years and with that comes a changing skyline and a demand to keep up with the population.
