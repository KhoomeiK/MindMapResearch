AskTrumpSupporters,fdrhrsy,t1_fdrfn3g,1578684616.0,"> How is shifting that line past assault weapons inherently wrong then?

Well this reveals many different things but I'll address some of them.

First; I'm not against that. Unlike some of the others here I'm not so confident in the ""arm everyone it'll work"" mindset, but I do believe that disarming isn't the way to go.

Second, that word right there that you used: ""Assault weapon"". What does that mean? Can you define it? People say an Ar-15 is an assault weapon, yet a semi-auto rifle is not, despite the fact that the AR-15 is just a scary-looking hunting rifle. The term ""assault weapon"" is incredibly vauge and non-specific. Many pistols can deal more damage than an AR-15, yet the AR-15 is being made the devil, presumably because it *looks* scary. 

Assault weapon is not a standard term and it does not mean what you think it means. If I took the grip/handle off an Ak47, it is not classified as an assault weapon anymore. If an AR-15 removes it's flash hider, it's no longer an assault weapon. Do these classifications really matter at all when rifles make up [such a low amount of shootings in general?](https://www.statista.com/statistics/476409/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-weapon-types-used/)

Banning weapons based on ""scarwy modifications"" is silly. They should purely be based on volume of fire."

AskTrumpSupporters,fdr7dsm,t3_emi2in,1578680544.0,"We have to better the country climate in general.

No amount of pro-gun or anti-gun legislation will help lower gun deaths. (Most of them are crime related anyway). The issue here is that people are just fed up and wish to instill harm. Banning guns will just make pro-gun people more likely to do a shooting spree, giving people guns will make anti-gun people more likely to do a shooting spree.

At this point, I'd say the gun debate is way too complex to make this a simple ""more/less gunz plz"" solution. 

Id also say we need to give people less of a reason to perform a shooting. Ban media coverage on releasing the name of the shooter, or ban coverage that glorifies shootings for views altogether. Lots of shooters do it for attention; let's starve them of that.

Gun violence is a symptom of the problem, not the cause. If not guns, it be knives, stolen guns, acid, drive by robberies, etc. 

Banning guns to reduce gun deaths is like banning driving to reduce car accidents. Yeah it lowers it, but isn't that at the cost of freedom? I'd be for requiring gun training like a license; I'll take a 1 hour quiz followed by a 1 hour test. Whatever. But don't act like gun control is the solution to a *violence* problem."

What Overwatch needs is to pull away from the competitive scene. The more competitive a game is, the more toxic the community is. Rainbow Six? Used to be fine, the sweats came in, now it's toxic. League of Legends? Toxic. 

Now look at Team Fortress 2. I know; the unspeakable game for Overwatch, but it is the least toxic community of the FPS genre. Why? Because of the casual centered culture and nature of the game.

Overwatch needs to focus on being less competitive, and less ""authoritarian"" about playing the game ""the right way"". The balance needs to be less rock-paper-scissors to promote the idea that all characters are viable against any target, thus allowing more emphasis on freedom of choice being completely viable. 

I personally left the game for big spans of time because the casual scene is just too serious. If a game gets to the point where ""Casual is just competitive warmup"", you most likely have a toxic community."

If Trump wished to address instead the Nationwide homelessness, he could pass policy against things such as laws specifically made to dissuade the homeless (something I'd be for). As far as the National government helping out only California, I'd say that isn't what the Federal government is for.

AskTrumpSupporters,fdrhrsy,t1_fdrfn3g,1578684616.0,"> How is shifting that line past assault weapons inherently wrong then?

Well this reveals many different things but I'll address some of them.

First; I'm not against that. Unlike some of the others here I'm not so confident in the ""arm everyone it'll work"" mindset, but I do believe that disarming isn't the way to go.

Second, that word right there that you used: ""Assault weapon"". What does that mean? Can you define it? People say an Ar-15 is an assault weapon, yet a semi-auto rifle is not, despite the fact that the AR-15 is just a scary-looking hunting rifle. The term ""assault weapon"" is incredibly vauge and non-specific. Many pistols can deal more damage than an AR-15, yet the AR-15 is being made the devil, presumably because it *looks* scary. 

Assault weapon is not a standard term and it does not mean what you think it means. If I took the grip/handle off an Ak47, it is not classified as an assault weapon anymore. If an AR-15 removes it's flash hider, it's no longer an assault weapon. Do these classifications really matter at all when rifles make up [such a low amount of shootings in general?](https://www.statista.com/statistics/476409/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-weapon-types-used/)

Banning weapons based on ""scarwy modifications"" is silly. They should purely be based on volume of fire."

AskTrumpSupporters,fdr7dsm,t3_emi2in,1578680544.0,"We have to better the country climate in general.

No amount of pro-gun or anti-gun legislation will help lower gun deaths. (Most of them are crime related anyway). The issue here is that people are just fed up and wish to instill harm. Banning guns will just make pro-gun people more likely to do a shooting spree, giving people guns will make anti-gun people more likely to do a shooting spree.

At this point, I'd say the gun debate is way too complex to make this a simple ""more/less gunz plz"" solution. 

Id also say we need to give people less of a reason to perform a shooting. Ban media coverage on releasing the name of the shooter, or ban coverage that glorifies shootings for views altogether. Lots of shooters do it for attention; let's starve them of that.

Gun violence is a symptom of the problem, not the cause. If not guns, it be knives, stolen guns, acid, drive by robberies, etc. 

Banning guns to reduce gun deaths is like banning driving to reduce car accidents. Yeah it lowers it, but isn't that at the cost of freedom?

Now look at Team Fortress 2. I know; the unspeakable game for Overwatch, but it is the least toxic community of the FPS genre. Why? Because of the casual centered culture and nature of the game.

Overwatch needs to focus on being less competitive, and less ""authoritarian"" about playing the game ""the right way"". The balance needs to be less rock-paper-scissors to promote the idea that all characters are viable against any target, thus allowing more emphasis on freedom of choice being completely viable.

If the US is subsidizing Mexico by taking in their impoverished, should Mexico repay the US?"
AskTrumpSupporters,fc39g04,t3_efxnlj,1577384678.0,"Well California has the strongest economy of any US state, so it wouldn't make sense to give them funding if we were also trying to decrease unnecessary spending.

Clearly, the issue lies purely in management, as the location of the state is prime as well.

I'm not sure how any politician would help the California issue without being a California politician. All the president could do is rally Californians to remove bad leaders from office. 

I don't think the federal government needs to be involved here considering that California has all the resources neccessary to help itself. 

You can't encourage more business in California; it's already the business powerhouse of the US on the west coast. You can't encourage more tourism or residents to settle there considering that's arguably the issue at hand. 

Unless if you'd accept the president being allowed to *forcibly* take state leaders out of office, which I would be against no matter the circumstances, there isn't much to do in this specific instance. This isn't like Flint Michigan where we are dealing with a small town that's economically drained; we're talking about the most populated state with the strongest economy. 

Trump can call for policy change (which he has, and has been met with resistance), and that should be the extent of his powers."
AskTrumpSupporters,fbz7w8p,t1_fbz0tjb,1577237847.0,"Cancel culture is the idea that if a person does something that could be offensive, person must atone and pay for their crimes, no matter the scale of offense and no matter the time.

Normally I wouldn't be against this in general, but the issue is far beyond the goals of the movement. It has quickly became a ""guilty before proven innocent"" movement, which is a completely toxic mindset to be in. 

Examples of victims include youtuber Pro-Jared, who was ""canceled"" after it came out that he cheated on his wife. Deals were closed, subscribers and reputation lost, until months later, after Jared consulted lawyers on what to do for this *private* matter and he revealed that in fact his wife was abusive. Thankfully, he has recovered since his loss, but the fact that we all jumped to his guilt so fast proves how toxic the culture is.

Another example is Vic Mignogna, who was fired from his voice acting job at RoosterTeeth for a rape allegation. After the internet surfaced and blew up the incident, he was fired from all projects he would have worked on and replaced. Later it was proven that the accusation was purely fake, yet his job was already gone. Another example of cancel culture's horrible ""Guilty before proven innocent"" mindset. 

I appreciate exposing a person's past, but I feel that this idea that everyone must always ""answer for their past"" is a bad one, especially the assumption of the worst that forms. Perceptions and context change, and taking things out of both can make anything look bad."
