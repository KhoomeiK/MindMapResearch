TNG,ffidt5y,t1_fficfhv,1579971485.0,"I'm old enough that I never watched TNG when it first came out because it wasn't the ""Real"" cast and captain picard was, like, old (HA!).   So, season four is when I probably started watching.

Few thoughts though:

You don't really need to have ever seen TOS to watch TNG.   Also, in '87, the show's general concepts (aka ""Beam me up, Scotty"") are broadly understood popular culture.   Star Trek IV had just come out the year before and dominated the box office.    

Another thing is that in 87, TNG was an extremely high budget show for UHF syndicated TV.   But, it was still syndicated TV.    Honestly, for the show to have gotten the ratings it got really was pretty impressive for those days.   Especially considering how fucking garbage the first few years are (there, I said it).   It says a lot about the cultural penetration of a show that made it 3 years in the 60s, that such relatively by-the-numbers 80s syndicated TV writing did as well as it did.

Even still, for most of my life, Kirk & Co. were the ""real"" cast.   And it's funny because these days, TNG is everything great about Star Trek for me, and I find TOS unwatchable.     Honestly, if it wasn't for what a fucking amazing movie Wrath of Khan is (and how enjoyable IV and VI are), I would just as soon forget the crew of 1701/1701a."
