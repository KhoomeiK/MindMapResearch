I've made it a point to find things like that, and I always defer to those with more education than me in terms of living things. My ex partner did habitat restoration under the supervision of ecologists, so whenever plants needed to get removed because they are invasive I would always try to join in. I tell all my friends to get ahold of me if they need something on their property removed or torn down. I've specifically searched out a few jobs that required rock smashing or blackberry removal. Also, for what it's worth, I avoid hurting animals at all costs due to childhood experience growing up on a farm. I don't even kill arthropods when I find them in my house.

It's possible to enjoy destroying things, and also have the kind of conscience that forces you to do it in the right way. I know I have some violent tendencies, and I make a point of getting them out through productive acceptable destruction, or mutually consensual combat sports."

""The Great Leap Forward of the People's Republic of China (PRC) was an economic and social campaign by the Communist Party of China (CPC) from 1958 to 1962. Chairman Mao Zedong launched the campaign to transform the country from an agrarian economy into a communist society through the formation of people's communes. Mao decreed increased effort to multiply grain yields and industry should be brought to the countryside. Local officials were fearful of Anti-Rightist Campaigns and competed to fulfill or over-fulfill quotas based on Mao's exaggerated claims. They collected ""surpluses"" that in fact did not exist, leaving farmers to starve. Higher officials did not dare to report the economic disaster caused by these policies, and national officials blamed bad weather for the decline in food output and took little or no action. The Great Leap resulted in tens of millions of deaths.[1] A lower-end estimate is 18 million and upper estimates find that some 45 million people died.[2] About the same number of births were lost or postponed, making the Great Chinese Famine the largest in human history.[3]""
