But now that my eyes have leveled off (same prescription for a few years) I'm excited to see how much more affordable Lasik is. Used to be a couple thousand per eye, now I've seen ads for about 250-400 per eye! I'm saving up to gift it to myself, super excited."

And the stories I heard about them were just as hilarious. It's the point when you realize your parents were just as wild in their youth as you. 

And my parents, at least, knew about so many things I thought I kept secret. But they just never brought it up at the time, thank God."
