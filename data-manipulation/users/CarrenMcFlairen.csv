Pet - dragon and heckhound üòÅ

Wizard101,fdsa5sc,t1_fdrkiyr,1578697891.0,"There are! 


But basically pet breeding is rng, rng, rng. Even the looks the pet inherits is rng from my experience. (Unless of course the two parents are the same kind like dragon+dragon) To sum it up, if you're going to get a healing pet (maycast fairy) you'll have to get a pet that either is known to have that trait or breed the trait into it's offspring by breeding with a pet that has said trait. 

Breeding is purely rng when it comes to inheriting traits from the parents but I have found that if both parents have the same trait it's far more likely to be passed down.

Honestly I can't blame you for not getting into breeding it can be a hassle but if you're really determined then I'd say go for it! If you want a pet that does have ""maycast"" healing skills I've got a good pet that casts frequently but that's if you're still somewhat interested."
