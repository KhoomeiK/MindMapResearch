asktrp,fdl1dp9,t3_elthxg,1578515355.0,"Cold truth time: the mere fact that you've been in an LTR for six months with this girl means you'er probably not the highest SMV guy she's ever fucked. 

A girl will have a hardest time keeping around the highest-SMV guys, and she can potentially have a lot more ONSs than LTRs in her life b/c ONSs by definition don't take as long. 

So if you LTR a girl, you just need to realize that, if you're in a Western metro area in 2020, odds are good she's fucked at least one 'alpha that got away'. If you can't handle that in principle, either avoid LTRs or screen for virgins.

Otherwise, this is a non issue. Has there been any indication she's still/back in contact with him? Has she been bringing him up in conversation? If you have no evidence she's been thinking about him since your LTR with her started, then there's nothing worse here than in a typical LTR with a modern metro-area thot, so this isn't really a reason to dump her unless you're swearing off LTRs in general. Or just bored of her and need to give yourself an excuse.

If what you said about your career and physical boy are accurate, and your game is decent, your SMV is good. But the kiss of death is if you let her know that this ex is 'getting to you' or you're insecure. Do not EVER bring him up, it might give her the idea to get back in touch with him ."

Might be their daughters (although at the end of Bogus Journey they each had an infant son, so I'm not sure if the older brothers are off elsewhere or they just retconned / handwaved that away). 

I'm still getting a vibe of a 'torch passing movie' - it'll either turn out that in the 'final' timeline, the daughters are the real saviors of the future (maybe we'll get a shot of statues of them in the future instead), or that Bill and Ted are in a funk, have never achieved their greatness, and their daughters have to spur them to fulfill their destiny."
