So in these people’s eyes, congress under Clinton was a legitimate authority not to be toyed with, and doing so was a hard core crime.  Yet they support a guy know who has obstructed congress at every turn, withheld evidence, ordered people to disobey congressional subpoenas  and could never sit for questioning without perjuring himself almost immediately.
