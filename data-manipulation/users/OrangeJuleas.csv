What it effectively does is take the kindness that the entire tipping culture is based around. You treated me well, so *let me treat you well*. This is just ""we realize that our servers are making more than BOH, so we're going to charge you extra to make up for it, whether you like it or not"".

I am required to have my own transportation to work, which means that I'm either paying a monthly service fee (which can change depending on timing and traffic), or maintain my own depreciating asset as well. I know many people who commute, unpaid, at least an hour to work. I know a few people who commute 2 hours to work, each way. I know of one person who commutes 3 hours (give or take depending on traffic) every day because he bought a house far away because it was affordable.

Subcontracting and agencies involved are on the rise and are undoing all social and economic progress we have made in the labor market over the last 100 years. Of course they're booming, look at the companies using them. Uber is just a staffing company that cut out the middleman.

AskReddit,fffq040,t3_etbrdf,1579889292.0,"I had a cat, he lived almost 22 years until he was unfortunately stricken down in our cul-de-sac by a hit-and-run driver one day. He did 3 things that still amaze me:

1. We moved to a house on a ranch when I was a young teenager in the hills. When I say hills, I really mean Santa Monica mountain range, and it's still very wild. One year later, we moved to a house 8.1 miles away (by car, per Google, about a 5 hour walk for a human), which crossed the freeway and involved travelling from a rural house to the suburbs. When we left the ranch house, we couldn't find the cat, and being a ranch (and him an outdoor cat), we figured that nature finally caught up to him, so we left. We never took him to our new place (why would we?), but out of nowhere, 1 month later, he showed up at our new place. He lived there for about 15 years before he finally passed.
2. He would ""walk"" with us when my family would go on nightly walks around the block. We didn't take the same path every night, and he wouldn't always join us, but most of the time, when he was already outside, he would trail behind us on the opposite side of the block, usually ducking behind cars, bushes, trees and only walking in direct view when there was no cover. I have no idea why he did this, perhaps he just liked the company?
3. Closer to the end of his life (for maybe 5-6 years), he would just pick up his food (wet food) with his paw and eat it directly out of his paw, then scrape the can and do it again. Obviously, he couldn't do this with dry food, but we typically mixed the two together anyway for him. I was lucky enough to have captured this a few times on really shitty quality cell phone video (I think a Blackberry or Razr) that I still have to prove it. I'm sure this is probably not uncommon for cats seeing how smart they are, but most cats I see never do this.

There are so many more stories I have of this amazing cat, but those are the three I usually tell people."

gaming,ffcrs73,t3_esw8j6,1579805927.0,"I'm torn on this. For several reasons:

1. The Gamestop local to me is surprisingly good. There used to be about three of them, but now only the one remains. The employees there are super nice and generally very helpful. They've always done right by me, and never tried to push warranties or cell phone trade-in's or pre-orders unless I expressed direct interest in something. They've helped me get cases for games that I had that didn't have any. I will miss the store.
2. There's only one ""Mom-and-pop"" game store in my city (run by a younger guy who is making a chain out of it) and the prices they charge are generally higher than the Gamestop I go to. Returns are generally more difficult there as well. They don't have as good of a selection of modern games, but obviously the classic/retro selection is pretty good. I only go here when I need something special or something for an older system.
3. That being said, Gamestop's online services have routinely let me down. I buy physical games for the case artwork and manuals/soundtracks (if the game comes with either). Half the time I get the generic case without anything else, and about 30% of the time I get my order cancelled outright after about 2 weeks because they are out of stock (and yes, they were in stock when I placed the order). I have pretty much given up shopping here at all, even if there's something I want in particular.
4. Some other people have said this already, but without some sort of actual used marketplace (eBay and Amazon barely count), the push to go all digital from the big 3 may finally materialize. At this point, I'm not lamenting the death of physical media that you can hold, feel, and enjoy the secondary materials, but still, it's definitely the end of an era, and I will probably play less now that my friends and I can't just buy a copy of a single player game and share it.
5. The poor employees. As poorly as so many of them are treated, many of them are put in years and years of their life into a career revolving around games and with independent shops being minimal, they'll be out of work and have to move onto something else, and unless they have management experience, will likely have to enter a different field at ground level, making little and being treated no better, if they are able to transition at all."
