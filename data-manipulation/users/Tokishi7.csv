worldnews,fegthi4,t1_fegpst2,1579102165.0,"They plan to have each future “drone”/RC craft serialized so that these large drones will avoid the small craft. Normally this was done for really large stuff, like 1:5 scale or bigger. .55lbs VS 50lbs is huge in the RC field. The battery alone weighs close to .55lbs for most people. Most people also fly their drones above 400feet, especially with the invention of first person goggles these days. 

I sidetracked a bit but due to all of these craft being serialized now, each craft you have will need to be individually registered so it will need corresponder plus the registration fee. We have 10 craft at my home alone. 

This looks like companies like amazon didn’t want to worry about the cost of flying above 400 feet when it comes to deliveries to save costs. Most people never flew RC craft in a city anyways because it’s expensive if they get ran over, you get sued, and you can’t navigate as well. 

This bill is near negligible to me because I live in rural America, these companies will never use drones to deliver to my house. I also wouldn’t put professional recording and photography companies out of the bribe zone either.  

There have been very few commercial craft and unmanned collisions. The only one I can think of is a drone hitting a helicopter blades that proceeded to completely shred it, this was a rather large drone too"
