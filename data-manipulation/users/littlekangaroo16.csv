Carebears,ffi43m6,t3_etrk92,1579964512.0,Good question. My favorite care bear is either bedtime bear or wish bear. Favorite cousin is either bright heart raccoon or loyal heart dog. favoritism is based of their aesthetic and cuteness level.

OnePiece,fcvhuwu,t1_fcvhnp0,1578002409.0,your right he will beat him. But most people supremely doubt it would be a solo effort. Luffy needed alot of help against doflamingo who is terrified of kaido

OnePiece,fcvd2cj,t3_ej45pm,1577999560.0,By the time luffy reaches laugh tale i dont think hell be the strongest. I see him as an admiral level character by that time. But the reason luffy is worthy of the title of pirate king is because of his ability to turn anyone he meets into an ally. Which may or may not include the yonko and admirals when the time comes to fight the celestial dragons the gorosei and imu

nofriends,fctl0ta,t3_e9e9c7,1577947159.0,well i dont have friends because of my introverted tendencies. Im really depressed and a bit anxious but the root problem is even when i interact with others i often feel like an alien disconnected lost in my mind. its just how i am

depression,fct5lus,t3_eiqt1d,1577933476.0,when they say it will get better their speaking from a position of ignorance and blind optimisim. But thats not to say everything from here on will suck theirs no such thing as a perfect life therefore one could assume the opposite is also true. While i cant promise youll ever be happy again. Its very unlikely that there wont ever be a happy moment again. The thing that sucks the most about it is that it requires the one whos depressed to alter their lifestyle which is a fucking burden
depression,fct3y71,t3_eir5wa,1577932254.0,Yeah i dread going to sleep too. I feel like the only time when i can be myself and think for myself is when im finally alone at night. And thats usually when the depression kicks in because im not putting on a fake personality for family or friends. Im not even consciously doing it and being myself even to the people closest to me is such an alien concept. Even when i tell myself that im going to be myself it never ends up being truly me. I wish i could show everyone who i really am
