WhitePeopleTwitter,fedvq22,t1_fedqnhu,1579020901.0,"Dude, yes finally someone said it. My family has RLS like at least one person in each generation. I got it as well real bad because of ADHD and I know it’s distracting so I would try to stop it but it was like my leg was on fire if it didn’t move. It was less about anxiety and more about pain. I had to get prescribed gabapentin for it to stop."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fedun3n,t3_eol0s5,1579020252.0,See there are the assholes who just didn’t care and don’t care now. The there are the ones who just had no idea the impact it could have. Their parents told them it was no big deal and at the time the information wasn’t there. The pattern continues and then they are stuck in their way. Some change but not enough do. Not giving them a pass or anything just saying there is a reason. Not anymore I should say but I work and deal with a lot of boomers so I’ve listen to their shit for a long time.

todayilearned,fd40roi,t3_ejwxed,1578163329.0,"As a millennial who grew up with a single mother, I’ve always thought if I had a child I wouldn’t leave it’s side. Something about growing up as a male without a dad made it feel like I was left out of the boys club, so to speak. I taught myself to shave, talk to girls, and fix things. Granted I got all those ideas of manliness from tv. Either way if I had a child I always thought I’d spoil it with something I always wished for. Now I took care of my sisters as well so I got the training and honestly get along with women more."

Fallout,fcrm57g,t1_fcptaq9,1577903616.0,"I play fallout NV on xb1 and it has small issues like crashing but all in all I have had a great time playing it. Can’t believe it took me so long to play it, just started like a couple weeks ago. After I beat it at least 3 times I’ll move on to fallout 3( played but never got past the megaton decision) but from what I’ve heard mods make it better for pc. If you have the game pass fallout NV, 3, and 4 are all on there. I snagged them"
todayilearned,fcrci1z,t1_fcq1dih,1577899979.0,Thank you!!! I used to shy away from telling others til I was told it could be the inspiration an addict might need to change. Now I’ll tell whoever will listen
todayilearned,fcrc9nb,t1_fcr9g8c,1577899888.0,"Well I’ve dated around while in recovery, which to anyone who thinks this is wise just don’t. That being said I’ve had exs with substance abuse problems and while I can’t say for all, I can say in two instances where I was dating a girl in recovery or in active addiction it does seem to stunt you a bit. Being worried I was cheating when I literally made a point to really only talk to family. They both thought I wasn’t in to them when I really was. As to the property damage I had the same experience. After we broke up we still lived together and she was “dating” someone else if you can call it that but I made one stooopid remark and said he looked like Stuart little fuck nosfaratu(sp?) and bam, my iPad, Xbox, and cell phones were smashed by the time I woke up. Drug abuse really is really regressive to your maturity level. I myself regressed when using and relapsing just makes it all the worse. I’m not trying to discourage you from ever giving a recovering addict a chance but know that set boundaries must be set and heavily enforced. Addict’s who say they are clean when they are not will do anything to make it appear they are not using. Any little shred of evidence they know you can find they will hide. Thank you for the congratulations, it seems easy now but hard to say it was ever easy til it got easy. If that makes any sense!"
todayilearned,fcphi2w,t1_fcpft46,1577864301.0,"Speaking as a an opiate addict(2 years clean and counting) I’d say no, not everyone had to steal to get a fix. I did and today I even have opportunities to steal but when sober there is a nagging voice to not slip back into the pattern. If I do I have to immediately tell on myself or correct the wrong. It’s case by case but opiate addiction is a whole different beast than any other drugs I’ve done. I’ve quit drinking, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and smoking but opiates and opioids are by far the hardest thing to quit. I tell everyone not to even give it a chance because it changes you. So maybe she was just a shitty person or maybe through substance abuse she has turn into that person. It’s hard to tell but I’d say most Addict’s can have the capacity to steal like it’s going out of style. Hope it answered your question. Lemme know if there is any other question I might be able to share my experience about."
