Yes, most people who claim to be feminists aren't inherently bad, however, the people who have always controlled the movement, as far back as the 1600s, have been openly anti-male. Their books are freely available. That comment details exactly why the ""moderate feminist"" DOES NOT EXIST. The group you claim to be a part of has, historically, shown itself to be completely anti-male at all the highest levels of leadership, and men have been giving women what they ask for, for 400 years, with no gains for the common man. The actual feminists are the ones that *have* political power, and every single one of them has been man-hating for generations.

Again, the word you're looking for is Egalitarian, if you read that comment and the subsequent thread, you'd see why

Also, no one here will say women have no problems, we are saying that mens problems don't matter, don't get funding, and are told to ""wait until all the issues of everyone else are solved"", because of some imagined Patirarchy, that the common man has never been a part of, and in many cases, just never existed"
