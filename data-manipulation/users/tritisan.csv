Strong pot can be disorientating and a bit trippy. But it’s nothing compared with LSD. Imagine every synapse in your brain firing 100x more than usual. Every sense organ in your body is AMPED. Then you discover organs you never knew you had. 

Imagine that going on for 10-12 hours but since time has disappeared it feels like forever. Depending on your experience and personality type, this forever could be heaven or it could be hell. Or both.

I met a girl at a bus stop once. We chatted while waiting and she ended up inviting me to her place. She was not my type, but I thought it might be fun nonetheless. (No, I didn’t grab her boob.)

At her apartment, there are a couple of her friends hanging out and we end up watching A Clockwork Orange and drinking. One of her friends is sitting in front of me. She most definitely is my type. 

To this day I have no idea why I felt so confident about what I did next. 

I reached around and slid my hand up her t-shirt and, to my delight, found a juicy pair of A-cups unencumbered by a bra. She didn’t move or say anything so I continued fondling her while watching one of the most fucked up movies ever. 

Turns out she was 17. I was 23. She was also a Virgin. I do not have a Virgin fetish. The idea of popping a cherry never appealed. But we started dating anyway. 

A few weeks later she proudly announces that not only is it her 18th birthday, but that she fucked a friend of hers. I was so thrilled! No jealousy at all. It was a huge relief. 

Yes we fucked after that."

dataisbeautiful,feuv65j,t1_fet5vrv,1579390291.0,"I've spent FAR too much time thinking about this. Maybe you can help me out.

Life, at the macro level, assuming the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum wave function collapse, can be either completely deterministic (with or without a supernatural, omnipotent Being/Creator) or completely non-deterministic (stochastic, but not random). In the former case, free will is merely illusory. For the sake of argument, and in the name of Science (!), let's say the latter is true: We do indeed have free will, bound by physical laws. 

If we were to create a map of all the possible directions (in physical or parameter space) your life *could* have taken, we would need to identify what I refer to as a ""branching event"". For example, imagine you're driving in an unfamiliar town and come to a stop sign at a four-way intersection. You're not sure which way your destination lies (let's say the GPS is not working). You could turn left, go straight, or turn right. This is one branching event. With hindsight, you (or somebody else) with complete knowledge of the parameters of the situation (i.e., a detailed street map, traffic conditions, crime statistics, etc.) could map out all the what-ifs:

A left turn results in your finding the destination, but it takes an extra hour and you're late for your appointment. 

Going straight gets you to your destination on time.

Going right, you end up in a bad neighborhood and get carjacked.

This is very straightforward. However, for every known, binary decision, there are probably a hundred billion obscured factors, or ""invisible branches.""

The fundamental question remains: What constitutes a ""branching event"", the thing that determines the arc of the plot? Here's just a sampling of the more obvious candidates...

* A conscious decision on my part.
* An unconscious decision on my part. (Neuroscience tells us most of our decisions begin unconsciously.)
* A decision (conscious or otherwise) on someone else's part that directly or indirectly affects me.
* A purely coincidental ""collision"" of events where no decision could have been made.

You can see how messy this plot could get, even if you limited it to a very short timeframe. I suppose one could design a ""filter"" or ""zoom level"" to highlight only the causal factors that truly made a difference. But is this even possible, using the algorithms and computers available?

Maybe it's best not to ponder this too long or too deeply. There be monsters here!"

For me the choice of a square-ish aspect ratio for The Lighthouse effectively accomplished three things:

- Along with the black and white film look, the movie looked authenticity period piece. It supported the vintage clothing, architecture, even language/accents. 

- It lent itself to the boxed-in, claustrophobic feeling of the story. 

- It allowed the cinematographer to frame most of the shots in an unconventional and somewhat alienating manner. Which, again, supports the story’s otherworldly feel."
