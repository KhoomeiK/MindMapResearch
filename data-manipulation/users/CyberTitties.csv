The idea went away with the next car since it had most sophisticated anti-theft electronics, but hey still a simple idea that would prevent the guys trying to make it quick."

But I believe I saw this, although to be fair, if you watch his show he brings it up every once in awhile certainly in a comedic sense and I believe that is how he keeps himself on the straight and narrow."
