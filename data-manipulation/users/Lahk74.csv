People love it because there really aren't (m)any unavoidable, buggy deaths. You die and you realize, yeah I shouldn't have done that or oh, I see what I did wrong. Before you know it you are 10x better than you were, and there is such a sense of satisfaction in overcoming a boss that you previously struggled with. They are games that are fantastic at subtly teaching you to play better."

1. At what date will I allow my mother to feel happiness and joy again?
2. Is it my place to make relationship decisions for my parents?
3. Does my dad love us enough to want us to be happy, no matter the source of the happiness?

Life isn't a zero sum game. Trying to salvage some happiness in your or your mom's life after a tragedy doesn't mean either of you love your dad any less.

How can you so strongly feel like you are absolutely right in your beliefs when evil fucks like neo-nazis fall within your group? Not all conservatives are neo-nazis, but all neo-nazis are conservatives.

I have never seen a conservative concede a point. Ever. I can admit that sometimes liberal policies can get stupid. I used to feel like I was a centrist, but now there isn't any fucking middle ground and it pisses me off. It's a choice between the people trying to be good human beings and sometimes fucking up versus evil, lying imbeciles.

Also, I am a gun owner and support the 2nd amendment. But the NRA can go fuck right off. They don't represent me. Let's fucking do something about the out of control gun violence, not sit on our hands and put our head in the sand.

You don't complete a base campaign and then transition into a 2nd dlc campaign. The dlc is completely integrated into the normal campaign and is done simultaneously.

If you're starting from scratch either way, just start a new wotc campaign. The base campaign before dlc is good, but adding wotc is just so much better.
