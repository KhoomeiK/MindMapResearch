3) Thou shalt clean thy work carefully, lest thy gaze upon thy work falling apart as it passeth out of thy sight. 

4) Thou shalt place thy work in jigs, or other holding fixtures, for the eye is a poor instrument for the measurement of angle and great will be the wrath of thy leader as thou art doing thy task a second time. 

5) Thou shalt not weld near batteries, compressed gasses, or flammable materials lest a spark from thy labors cause thee to continue thy chosen profession in an open field or other such drafty place. 

6)Thou shalt take great care of thy tools and equipment, lest the friend who is in charge of such things smites thee about the head and shoulders for being a wastrel and a knave.

7)Thou shalt not perform thy art without proper ventilation, for the smell of toxic gasses produced by the heating of primers, and plated or painted surfaces is worse than a bad cigar and will remain with thee until the end of thy days. 

8) Thou shalt not not weld without goggles, nor shalt thou allow others to gaze upon thy labors, lest thy employment, or the employment, or the employment of others be changed to sitting on cold and rainy streets while selling pencils.

9) Thou shalt wear sturdy gloves, for burns upon thy hands are a source of great pain when thou art attempting to raise thy bowling average. 

10) Thou shalt ground thy work, when thou weldeth with a machine of arcs, for thou art a poor conductor of electricity and the shock which thou shalt receive shall ruin thy plans for thy weekend.

I managed to wiggle my foot slightly and kind of grunt, then a creepy demon-looking thing came crawling up over the end of my bed.

After that, I don’t remember what happened, but I must’ve gone back to sleep at some point.

That said, I am aware that I am not inherently “right”. The fact that I feel that a certain thing is wrong does not mean that it *is* wrong. I can accept that not everybody feels the way I do on any given subject, and I’m not going to push someone away just because we have different beliefs about, I don’t know, the death sentence, or religion, or whatever. As long as they know I don’t approve, and are okay with that, we can go on being friends. However, as I said before, there are absolutely limits. 

For example, I think that drinking is stupid and the only thing that consistently comes of it is irresponsible decision-making. Quite frankly, I’d be rather pleased if the Prohibitionists had gotten their way. Despite that, I’m still friends with plenty of people who drink on a regular basis, because I realize that most people don’t agree with me, and that’s fine. Where I draw the line is when it starts hurting or endangering other people.
