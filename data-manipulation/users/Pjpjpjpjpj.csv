news,ffjfr97,t3_etq2xf,1579997310.0,"Interesting. I wonder how much?

When I was in Egypt, the US government said they had arranged to evacuate all citizens due to the uprising. Yay - I thought. 

We were told that we would have to pay for the jet they chartered to fly us out.  How much? They couldn’t and wouldn’t say. Big jet and only 50 people decide to go - could be A LOT. No maximum, no assurances. Where was the flight going? Sudan (Khartoum)  - and we’d need to book our own flight out from there at whatever the last-minute rates from Sudan would be. 

Regular flights were still leaving the country. We declined the “evacuation.” 

I wonder if this evacuation is a similar offer?"
news,ffjeoyc,t1_ffi6ypz,1579996683.0,"1) Exclude those who are already sick;

2) Perform extra decontamination after flight (eg. aerosol spray);

Then -

A) Store the plane unused at a temp and humidity for a period of time that the virus is known not to survive. May be upwards of 28 days, higher temps, and either higher or lower humidity (average = bad).

And

B) Contact all passengers after the known incubation period and determine if they are symptomatic. They are probably going to do this anyway, for the CDC. 

If it’s been cleaned, allowed to sit long enough for the virus to die, and nobody has symptoms of the virus, good to go. 

Yes - this is expensive. A plane sitting unused for 28 days is expensive. But far less expensive than treating even one major infection."
dataisbeautiful,ffg74s5,t1_fffq3pj,1579899895.0,"But that doesn’t really matter when calculating overall mortality rates. 

If 3% of the infected people die, but would have otherwise lived, that is the mortality rate. There is no skew unless the initial population is substantially different (age, underlying wellness, etc) than the broader population. 

That doesn’t mean you have a 3% chance of dying if you are infected. 

It may be a 0.001% chance if you are an otherwise healthy 20 year-old, but 10% of you are an infant, or 22% of you are an 80 year-old, and 7% if you suffer from a respiratory disease like COPD. (Those are all made-up numbers of course.)

The point is that the overall mortality rate is not discounted or dismissed as skewed simply because it happens to be highest among certain vulnerable populations. When the disease goes to the UK or France, there will be a similar mortality rate unless the populations are vastly different or the counties can deploy effective treatments more efficiently than in China. 

I think it is fair to say that the vast majority of conditions work this way - pneumonia is high risk in a 90 year old with COPD but lower risk in a healthy teenager, but we simply recognize it has a 5-10% mortality rate among all patients treated in a hospital for the disease. 

Even cancer works this way - a frail 85 year old is far less likely to survive chemotherapy and all the side effects compared to a fit 20 year old. It still has an X% mortality rate overall."

todayilearned,ffdquah,t1_ffdaois,1579826720.0,"Treating sewage does not merely mean dosing it with antiseptics. 

Municipal sewage is treated in a multi-step process. 

The sewage goes through a series of filters/screens to remove objects and debris. Then the sewage flow is slowed so grit and gravel will settle, which are removed and land filled. The water is then allowed to sit in large circular clarifier tanks, where the settled material (sludge) is pumped out and any floating debris like grease is skimmed out and both are sent to digesters that use chemicals to remove phosphorus. 

Then - the biggest treatment step - the water is exposed to microorganisms which consume pollutants and break them down. These are not antiseptic chemicals - they are little bugs that digest the impurities. The water is then settled again and any new sludge sent back to the prior step. This resultant water is now 90% treated. 

The water next goes through a very fine mesh filter (several micron) and anything caught is sent beck to step 1 for reprocessing. 

Only now is the water disinfected. This can by by use of Ozone, by UV radiation (sunlight exposure), by Chlorine or by Sodium Hypochlorite. Chlorine has many disadvantages (including the need to dechlorinate the water before discharge) and while it is still common in older systems, is being used increasingly less frequently."
todayilearned,ffdkvhl,t3_esyiww,1579823031.0,"Just took a cruise and was able to participate in a “behind the scenes” boat operations tour for a ship with 2,200 passengers and about 900 crew. 

Fresh water on the ship is sea water. It is processed, treated and used for all fresh water purposes. 

(Note: ship sometimes takes in fresh water at port - about 5% of its needs - and has large tanks for ballast and because it can only make water while underway.)

Black and gray water is all routed back to a central treatment center on the boat. It is treated back to the same level of cleanliness as city municipal water system discharges. That water is discharged into the sea. 

All the recyclables are sorted by the crew member dropping off the trash and sold at various ports - glass by color (broken up in large mechanical smashers), cardboard, plastic by type, etc. 

Food is scraped off plates separately from just washing plates and things like “meat on the bone” is processed differently than leftover deli meat, etc. 

An incinerator similar to those used in many cities burns other waste, and filtered waste, at a high enough temperature to destroy the waste and scrubbers filter the remaining gasses. The incinerators produce power for the ship.  

The ship largely produces all their food from scratch (ice cream from scratch, all bread from flour, etc.) so they use mostly bulk packaging and have far less packaging waste than a normal home or even restaurant. 

They’ve done a lot to reduce waste - cloth napkins rather than disposable, etc. 

And the ship’s engines are basically jet engines using very low sulfur fuel. 

I won’t name the line (so as not to be accused of being a corporate shill), but it was a major global name everyone would recognize and wasn’t an especially premium brand. 

I’m sure there are still ships that dump everything at sea, use all plastic, and burn dirty fuel. And I know a lot of waste is still produced. But I was impressed to see how much can be done - and is being done in some cases. It certainly seems far better than any hotel or restaurant I’ve worked at.

PleX,ffcgioj,t1_ff7fm81,1579798967.0,The update that was just released appears to have fixed this issue.
SweatyPalms,ffa25le,t1_ff9p9ls,1579726376.0,"Uh. It’s a SKED. 

It is a victim movement and packaging device. The entire patient is put in the SKED and the victim can be dragged out of a dangerous situation - through a tunnel, up a manhole, etc. It can be used as a stretcher, a drag recovery device, for hazmat victim movement, etc. Can be used for helicopter recovery, high angle rescue, confined space recovery, etc. 

It is normally stored rolled up. This rescuer simply improvised and threw the rolled up SKED over the victim’s head as a last-ditch way to protect his airway. 

It is not designed, marketed or developed to be used in the way shown in this video. The rescuer improvised with what was available.

AskReddit,ff68cod,t1_ff5oflu,1579621531.0,"Many municipalities have traffic preemption systems for first responders. 

For example, many cities have an Opticom system on key strategic traffic lights. 

These are small light sensors mounted on the light post. Fire engines in that city will have a white light on the front of them that flashes at a certain frequency when the rig is being driven with its emergency lights on. (Police, ambulance may have it too.)

When the sensor sees a white light flashing with that specific frequency, it changes the traffic light to green in that direction and/or makes other traffic light signal changes to facilitate the flow of traffic. 

More modern systems know the GPS location of the apparatus, it’s destination, it’s estimated route of travel, and automatically changes lights through remote network controls.

This is common in large cities. It is usually not necessary or affordable in smaller cities where traffic congestion is less of an issue."
