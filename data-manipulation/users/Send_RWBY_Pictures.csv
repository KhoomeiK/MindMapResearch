Coronavirus,ffyzzzz,t1_fftxq22,1580359658.0,As an MD in an unrelated field who has educated themselves on the effect of the new coronavirus variant; any story should be documented. Please don’t remove the narrative  because their narrative allows a better understanding of the infection and epidemiology.

LivestreamFail,ffyrukr,t1_ffpw2pn,1580353594.0,"Pressure to undergo chemo therapy is especially hard due to resistance from family. During my primary residency, I had multiple patients where I called in my resident/fellow supervisor (I bet there’s some word for it but after years we only called him dan). We weighed the pros and cons of chemotherapy to give the best life possible. 

I don’t know your age, but if you’re pediatric (COG is weird so anywhere between 0-35) chemo is 100% worth it unless it can kill the odd patient."
madlads,ffyouoi,t1_ffymda8,1580351547.0,"Ehh, for me it’s the hypocrisy. I followed the drama and a lot of it was over sexualization. Seeing people make ‘sexier’ cartoons of themselves is top drama."
TrueOffMyChest,ffyo0ty,t1_ffxu7jm,1580350980.0,"Sadly a lot of groups are stuck in a ‘us vs them’ mentality. Part of my undergrad research was into this phenomena and members are complacent regardless of the topic. Everybody has their defined stance and non-adherence isn’t allowed. 

As a health care provider, I recommend groups based off of lived experiences. I would never refer an atheist to Alcoholics Anonymous because the views don’t line up. I hope you can find a similar group that can talk about their experiences. One thing I would recommend is asking a health care provider for groups that deal with underaged male on male rapes specifically. I can’t speak for the provider, but I have dozens of groups reaching out for a given issue on any given day and could help match a patient and group."
LivestreamFail,ffsjcir,t1_ffrgaum,1580183118.0,"You can’t do consistent transplants. If one fails, you need to let the body fight off the failed transplant and stabilize. This is hard because the body is now fighting invader cells from the unsuccessful transplant and the growing cancerous cells. 

Unfortunately, this was a case of being too late. There was no hope of recovery at her point."
LivestreamFail,ffpiq4e,t1_ffo9xyo,1580096006.0,"As a previous oncologist, cancer is what takes the life out of people. People with undiagnosed cancerous cells tend to be lethargic, fatigued, unable to get out of bed, consistently sick and overall unable to do anything. Chemo is the ray of hope that gives oncological patients a hope to survive. It sucks, I’m well aware, but it’s worth the fight and gives them strength to power on. Not undergoing chemotherapy is nothing but the calm before the storm."
tumblr,ffiqc10,t1_ffifnsp,1579980071.0,"You can but you shouldn’t. It’s toxic and causes cell division issues. I forget the the mechanism or if it’s even known, but when it’s within the cell in higher concentrations, cell division shuts off."
vaxxhappened,ff4y52g,t1_ff4sebc,1579575258.0,"Genetic abnormalities. One big thing they would look for is KIT gene amplification in peripheral blood and if positive, bone marrow progenitor cell amplification."
vaxxhappened,ff4xl2k,t1_ff4th66,1579574868.0,"This is caused by mastocytosis. Mastocytosis is not really an issue for children. Generally you do conventional cytogenetics for abnormalities for risk stratification. If it persists through adulthood, then there is more concern where bone marrow is tested for KIT gene mutation for prognosis."
TrueOffMyChest,fe5tsj3,t1_fe5m8u9,1578874773.0,"Tipping for a hair cut is stupid if it turns out average for a cheap haircut. I do a mix of $50 hair cuts and $15 hair cuts (depends who is free first). I don't tip on the $50 hair cuts but there's one stylist at the $15 place I always tip $35 because she does just as well as the $50. My hair is excessively thick so most people that do cheaper haircuts do a pretty poor just of cutting it to get the look I want. If a person performs an above and beyond job, I don't mind tipping to match their skill."

One thing that is commonly mistaken for is the puberty blockers vs hormones. Hormones is a term used for general hormonal interactions, which includes puberty blockers. In medical reports, any involvement with the body’s endocrine system is considered hormones. In front facing, its written as hormone blocker.  For example, some patients with excessive progesterone, I do not use the term anti progesterone It is written as hormone blocker. It’s easier for the patient to understand but anybody looking at the official medical record will have more insight."
TrueOffMyChest,fdfp0j7,t1_fdduy4c,1578366779.0,"I hate the direction internship has gone. I loved internship when I was starting out in college. You knew just enough to understand what you were learning working ~10 hours a week but would be a useless employee. Now, you pretty much need to be a full time unpaid employee who doesn't gain anything outside of being able to put 'Worked at X for 6-12 months' on the resume."
runescape,fdci77w,t1_fdc3peh,1578275527.0,You would still need to find the right tunnel. You only kill Linza to save time that would otherwise be spent killing everybody else for drop rolls you don't care about. There was some post made in /r/2007scape that found killing only one would save time overall for a specific piece but less profitable.

fatlogic,fcxl35a,t1_fcxdtzd,1578065545.0,It’s extremely rare to ever see patients like that. Thousands of patients and I’ve only had the one. Most FA people just don’t want to see the number so they go on backwards and aren’t shown weight and BMI in the patient report.
fatlogic,fcw855f,t1_fcw6bz4,1578019335.0,"Depends on the hospital/clinic. When I did clinicals, we only weighed when needed for medication or if there’s disbelief in patient provided weight. Current clinic, every patient is weighed. Anytime medication is based on size, medication can be withheld or given in too low dosage until the patient is weighed."
fatlogic,fcw5soh,t1_fcw473b,1578017816.0,"This is what I don’t get. Just get on the scale because all the staff knows your weight. Don’t want to see it? Who cares, get on the scale backwards so we can give better treatment because we can’t prescribe some drugs because your absolute weight isn’t known."
fatlogic,fcw54fn,t1_fcw3dkf,1578017367.0,"I see a patient that keeps saying she is around 210 when in reality closer to 250. Gets mad every time she comes in because I pull the ‘scale or no meds’ rule. I don’t care and I have never met a doctor that gives a shit how much somebody weighs, we’re just trying to not get hit with malpractice. We also have trained eyes so we already know their general weight before touching a scale."
FlorkofCowsOfficial,fcw44s6,t1_fcvv8xg,1578016714.0,Medical advances makes me hate my job. I would love my job if it meant I get to tell patients their humors are out a balance and give them coke prescriptions.
SugarPine7,fcsfj5l,t1_fcpglm8,1577915797.0,"Instagram requires me to sign in or make an account when I click the link. As somebody that doesn’t have Facebook or Instagram, direct screenshot is a lot better."
SugarPine7,fcsf0jy,t1_fcr0529,1577915602.0,Autumn transferred to inside gaming (Kinda an off shoot of funhaus but it’s own thing) when SP7 came to a close. They’ve been dating for quite awhile.
