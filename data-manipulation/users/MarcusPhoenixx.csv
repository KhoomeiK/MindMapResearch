How about the fact that I've been trying to hold a job since our oldest was born. Staying awake for over 24 hours in some instances just to help with money. I took care of my baby during the day and worked delivering newspapers all night long and repeated 6 days a week. Then she kicked me out for 3 weeks and asked for me to come back and I stupidly did.

Now I'm on veterans benefits bringing in money for the family and she spends close to $500 on the children during Christmas instead of thinking about saving for a house. I try to balance and budget and she spends hundreds of dollars on fucking things she doesn't even need like an instapot thing.

So yes she is a burden and yes i have given her plenty of space and thought and rarely am I locked up in the room due to an anxiety attack or some physical reason like my back gave out. I've given her so much time and change and she's given me a $20 blanket.

He is amazing and we are working super hard. His main job is to alert me to dangers that are real versus the asshole following me through target or Walmart that I might be thinking is but actually isn't. Also to act as a deterrent during stressful situations by putting himself between me and the other person.

Example. There's this amazing woman, pretty and sweet and never once had a cold word to say to me. I gave her a jacket that I couldn't fit into any more and she wanted to give me a hug. I have had major issues with boundaries between women and I and I guess Gilli picked it up because he put himself between us and she still wanted the hug and deeply I did too because no one does that for me really and it makes me sad. So this tiny tiny person is reaching like a foot over Gilli to hug my tall ass and we kinda meet in the middle.

On another hand when one of the therapist approached me at Saturdays training. He knew she was good people and wanted to smell her hand and say hi. Proving that she was not a threat. Side note on this. I've never met this therapist before. I knew the gal I gave the jacket to for a month at least.

So, he knows. Crazy, but he knows me."

I'll post a picture in a few. Gilli aka Gilmore is a border collie/lab mix

She's been doing dog training for over 30 years and today she just got another award from the community. She is from the Vietnam area as a K-9 trainer and has been doing it ever since she retired and she's owned and operated Operation Freedom Paws since 2010 with tons of success.

As far as me and California. Let me say this first. Living 3 years in Colorado and 20 years in Oregon. Any time it's over 60 degrees in California. I am basically on the surface of the sun. That being said. From 1991 - 1994 my family lives on Beale AFB. Now I live with my family in the Monterey Bay area. Really beautiful, but too many people ."
Assistance,ff4e50e,t1_ff4bhz0,1579561459.0,"Gilli is a service dog that has been matched to me. The program is called Operation Freedom Paws and they have a Facebook and everything else page. The program brings clients from all over California and you are matched with your dog on your interview. You are required to attend class 2x a week with your dog and in my case Gilli stays at the training center and has been since match day. You can't certify yourself and your dog until a minimum of 42week completion and then he or she is your dog to pay for everything and keep up training with. Right now he's just my match but still is owned by OFP.

As far as mental health. I'm seeing a really cool psychiatrist dude at the VA and he somehow gets that it's not easy for me with everything going on. I also see one of 3 therapists that's at every training at OFP once a week mainly by phone because of distance and ""projectile alley"". You can Google projectile alley to get a better idea. 

Basically it's a stretch of road, major roadway, that people have been shooting ball bearings at other people's cars. So I am open about taking my gun with me every training visit as to not scared or cause panic if by chance someone notices the traveling gunbox in my truck.

So to make sure those on the road, myself and the therapist are safe from any surprises. We mainly do a phone session which is also helpful.

Assistance,ff48xy5,t1_ff47jp8,1579558126.0,"I would use a therapist that is working with the training center for my service dog. I trust that therapist and she's been helping those with PTSD for over 30+ years and she knows the external struggles that people talk about and she openly admits she could never understand how someone with PTSD could feel. So I would go with her.

My wife chooses female therapists. They take her side because she's a very tiny therapist herself and a doctorate level at that. So that means business connections and free money, aka referrals.

I almost took the head off of one of her choices of couples therapist because she, couples therapist, said men can't be raped because they have to be aroused to have sex. Now that couples therapist had to leave the city because more and more men were getting the same comments from her and she fled to southern cali with zero notice to any of her clients.

So now that rants out of the way. Sorry. Even if your advice is to hang in there. Like you mentioned my kids are worth fighting for.
