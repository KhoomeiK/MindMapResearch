There's enough money, spending it correctly is a whole other story, nor does just throwing money at schools suddenly make kids educated. One of the biggest differences between public and private here is that private still keeps as many supplemental classes as possible, including PE, even though the private schools have more limited budgets in my area."

fatlogic,fcls1f6,t3_ehthqm,1577755068.0,"Actually, the fat people in my life are often the ones to make unwanted statements on my weight, talk about how I'm starving, how I won't keep it off and just be fat again soon, discuss diets constantly, and all around make negative comments.

FA's - stop bringing up my weight when you talk to me and making stupid ass assumptions like I'm totally healthy and just genetically programmed to be thin. You want to be treated as a human and not a weight? Maybe you should be the one putting in the work to do the same with others. The golden rule and all."

fatlogic,fcbcd1t,t1_fcaca9h,1577585139.0,"I'm glad you're doing well but I gotta say, that's a super low blood pressure. I float around 92/60 for my BP and get asked a lot during appointments if I run low. Did anyone mention anything to you about having BP that low?"
fatlogic,fcb65qt,t3_egrqt2,1577582871.0,"Ugh. I was abnormally thirsty yesterday and drank a lot of water \[and I mean a lot\]. This morning, started period 2.5 of the month because my body hates me with a passion. My weight yesterday morning was 134, this morning it was 140. All I've done is pee and be dizzy today. Not surprised. I'd ask to go see a GYN but all I've ever gotten has been 'here's more hormones!', and none have been helpful. Going back to the doctor soon, so I'll address it then, but I feel like I've been hit by a truck. I did break out the iron pills since I've done this dance before, so hoping tomorrow I'm a bit closer to human."
fatlogic,fatblpu,t1_faomrgx,1576336604.0,"Given that there is an addiction element to eating, we have disorders around compulsive eating, and people can't stop eating without medical intervention and without this they develop severe long-term physical/mental/emotional issues that can quite possibility lead to death - yes, it definitely can be.

Sorry, but if you feel the need to give into a compulsion to prevent a binge later - there is a significant problem that needs to be addressed, regardless of what you are using for this. 

I'm not saying everyone with a weight problem has an addiction, I'm saying that if you can't live without something unnecessary for survival without massive distress and/or self destructive behavior, maybe get yourself checked out."
