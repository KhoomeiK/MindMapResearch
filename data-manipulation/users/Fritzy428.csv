NarcissisticAbuse,ffit7km,t1_ffirozf,1579982118.0,"I've long said I dont like to deal in absolutes because they are rarely if ever accurate.  The world isn't made of absolutes the Always and Nevers would just drive me nuts, just extra irritant on emotional immaturity and more attempts at gaslighting and manipulation"
adhdmeme,ffirbsm,t3_etu87s,1579980767.0,Shit...me too
depression_help,ffiqdt6,t1_ffifsdb,1579980106.0,Thank you very helpful hopefully it subsides for me as well
BipolarReddit,ffhg7cr,t3_etmtpo,1579933886.0,"I absolutely know this same feeling, itz been nearly all depression for me for months and the hypomania never seems to last very long, I do some painting, re clean my room but always feel I still accomplished nothing. 
I finally went to a psychiatrist yesterday so it's not just me battling this anymore 
I hope you start feeling better"
bipolar,ff99yei,t3_es9j8i,1579708211.0,"I feel like it's just written all over my face. I dont wear any makeup (to be fair I usually dont anyway) I dont take very good care of my skin so my eczema will start breaking out (doesn't help that I'll rub my face a ton as well) and I'm either not sleeping enough or just getting crappier sleep, always tired so my dark circles get worse. What I see is essentially my whole face sort of sagging a bit and being sunken in."
NarcissisticAbuse,ff916dt,t1_ff8utuv,1579702249.0,"That was a tough one for me too. I journaled about everything since 13 or 14 years old, after a while with him I stopped since it was never safe. After leaving it's been a great tool for me to journal again especially about shitty things I remember after nearly two years away. I refuse to let anyone treat me so poorly again, writing about all the signs I've noticed after getting away makes me feel better. I get it out of my head and I have a record for myself"
NarcissisticAbuse,ff84ved,t1_ff7sqoe,1579666051.0,Yeesh I'm so sorry that's awful
NarcissisticAbuse,ff7btp8,t3_es1cwi,1579645844.0,"My narc used to read my diary MY DIARY and go through my phone because he ""got a feeling "" or if I wasn't talking to him enough. This is after I had opened up about MANY of my personal struggles and was shut down and told to get over what I struggled with because it wasn't fair to him that his girlfriend was mopey and depressed about things that fucking warranted it. 

Its baffling to ms still how I put up with his shit"
