GoldandBlack,ffmqui8,t1_ffmp8rq,1580057960.0,So you agree that rights are given to you by the entity at the top of the power hierarchy? The only difference between us is I don’t believe that there is a creator at the top of the hierarchy
GoldandBlack,ffgy9fc,t1_ffgws7d,1579918154.0,If govt didn’t exist I could murder a stranger and steal his land. This isn’t a strong argument for natural rights imo
GoldandBlack,ffee1b9,t1_ffedsw9,1579844549.0,Ya I misread it at first
GoldandBlack,ffe4uqa,t1_ffe4pap,1579836743.0,Couldn’t I kill someone and steal all of their resources in a state of nature?
psychology,ffam26l,t1_ffain65,1579739125.0,We evolved this sense for a reason. It’s undoubtedly far more useful than you’re giving it credit for
PresidentialRaceMemes,ff5ud3a,t3_erpu74,1579610558.0,I didn’t know that the NYT has done something controversial until seeing this post. Aren’t you doing what you claim you don’t want to do?
PKA,ff4w2fu,t1_feynf0d,1579573827.0,I totally agree. Tucker was the one being weird. He wouldn’t drop it. Woody clearly got the idea

AskMen,fezofh6,t3_eqvtup,1579459665.0,"As a guy who takes the majority of the shit in a group of friends, I honestly love it. I’m fairly clumsy and I’ve always been the type of guy who doesn’t really distinguish between people laughing with me and people laughing at me. When I’m with that group of friends it’s almost like I’m playing a character. 

It may sound weird, but I’m honestly never happier than when I’m around that group of friends “playing” that clumsy ditzy character"

BuyItForLife,fek5njf,t1_fek23xd,1579193122.0,"I think this would be perfect for most people, but I can already print stuff at work. I want a printer so that I can print out articles I want to read at home"
BuyItForLife,feitv14,t1_feiogah,1579147071.0,It says I’ll likely need to buy a $75 replacement ink cartridge every 2 months
CFB,feen4og,t1_feedphd,1579037119.0,He’s dissenting from the idea that NCAA athletes shouldn’t be paid
CFB,fedru9p,t1_fedk49c,1579018537.0,Whoosh. He’s clearly not this dumb. This is an obvious form of dissent. He’s protesting NCAA players not being allowed to be paid.
CFB,fedro0o,t1_fedri9e,1579018429.0,He’s a junior who I think has the talent to make it in the NFL
CFB,fedrfjv,t1_fedr0i1,1579018282.0,Exactly. I personally think it’s an excellent form of dissent
CFB,fedra3n,t1_fedorsm,1579018190.0,It’s seemed like a preplanned stunt on the part of obj and Jefferson. I’m actually a huge fan of the move. It’s an excellent form of dissent
PKA,fe623ez,t3_enpuyy,1578880055.0,Anyone got a link to this video? I’ve never seen it
GoldandBlack,fe5xevj,t1_fe5x8lf,1578877084.0,"I usually like the content of this sub, but clearly medicine isn’t its users’ expertise"
GoldandBlack,fe55386,t1_fe4oczb,1578865735.0,You went through my comment history and decided to focus on that?
GoldandBlack,fe4s4w1,t1_fe4qjv6,1578862293.0,You wouldn’t see the effects on cancer rates in less than a decade
GoldandBlack,fe4otca,t1_fe48qoa,1578861477.0,The comments on this post seem to think vaping and keto diets are the cause of the decline in cancer. And those comments have decent amounts of upvotes.
GoldandBlack,fe3pmh4,t3_eno1q4,1578851696.0,Oh my god. I never realized how stupid everyone on this sub was until I read the comments in this thread

JustBootThings,fd6ebkx,t3_ek4vcs,1578189670.0,86% of Americans don’t support a war with Iran. Blame the military industrial complex and war hawks like trump
PUBG,fd4ab6y,t1_fd404tv,1578165767.0,10 is my magic number too. I’ll keep more if I don’t have any first aid kits tho
KenM,fd0c51q,t1_fczz6kv,1578116730.0,The right has become the strongest advocates for free speech in the last few years. I hate to say it but it’s true

PKA,fcti8k9,t1_fct8s2d,1577944164.0,"Kyle would kill it. Nows the time to do it too. He’s probably really refined his prison stories by now.  Not to mention he’s just an interesting guy overall

I would love to see him go on Rogan as himself and not as fpsrussia or his PKA character. I wonder if his parole officer would let him fly to Rogan’s studio"
Tinder,fcteg3u,t1_fct1tet,1577940650.0,"No description of a boob is an insult. For every set of boobs there’s a guy out there who thinks it’s the perfect of set of boobs.

JoeRogan,fcs952t,t1_fcs6by5,1577913212.0,"I would definitely say the vast majority of his guests have above average intelligence. However I think the authors and professors he has on are much smarter than most of his other guests. 

I almost exclusively listen to the episodes with authors and professors on them now.  I’ll occasionally listen to a comedian I like too, but I refuse to listen to episodes with actors, musicians, or fighters now. Very few of them really have anything to say."
JoeRogan,fcs4m6l,t3_eib984,1577911393.0,"Everyone likes the show for different reasons, so there isn’t a best guest. Personally I like it when smart people come on the show, so I love it when Jordan Peterson comes on"

wholesomememes,fcrl8in,t1_fcrkqq2,1577903269.0,"What makes you say that? I think objectively speaking he’s in the top 1% of people in terms of being interesting. He’s lived a very interesting life, he’s much funnier than the average person, and he is an expert conversationalist."
wholesomememes,fcqzmr9,t1_fcqhbcr,1577894589.0,"I disagree that it’s a lot better. I much prefer a show like Joe Rogan’s where I can actually figure out if someone is interesting or not. 

I find talk shows incredibly disingenuous"

biology,fc6yaky,t1_fc6m7ek,1577492624.0,"Dude you seem to be really worried about your interest not being popular, but the great thing about science is that it doesn’t matter how niche of a topic it is. There’s always someone studying what your interested in and if there’s not that just means you can start a new field"
