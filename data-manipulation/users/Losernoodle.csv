AmItheAsshole,ff8rt1x,t1_ff86ycd,1579693553.0,"I'm so sorry! His allergy is also juice. If someone cut a fresh onion and used the same knife to cut a head of lettuce, he couldn't eat the lettuce.  As you know, nobody believes that.

He can't tolerate fresh garlic either. Dehydrated is fine.

Be careful! THERE'S ALWAYS ONION IN THE RED SAUCE! LOL!"
AmItheAsshole,ff81tz1,t1_ff80mzq,1579663776.0,"This! My ex has an onion allergy. Onions are hidden in everything!

He got so tired of dealing with it that he just gave up trying to eat at certain places. I embarrassed him by pushing the server with, ""Are you sure there's no onion?"" Ex lamented to a sympathetic server that so many people don't listen to him. She admitted most people say they're allergic when they simply don't like something. I was shocked (naive).  That diminishes the legitimacy of life threatening allergies."

AskReddit,ff3hi11,t1_ff2qu5j,1579541143.0,"The US has Social Security, but it's not enough. And, although life expectancy increases, the benefits don't keep up with a living wage. 

There are other governmental programs to aide the elderly, but you have to be below the ""poverty level."" For one person, that's USD 12,490 per year. As we age, we usually need more medication and different care. Also, for people without a support system, someone will need to provide assistance with house upkeep and maybe driving. Nothing is for free, so it just gets worse and worse.

It is a truly despicable situation."

You're setting a great example for them to be individuals with confidence.  Also it demonstrates how they should be treated in the future (love, support and compromise).
