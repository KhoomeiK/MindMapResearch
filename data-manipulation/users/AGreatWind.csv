In my defense this was all quite a few years back and I was more interested in long non-coding RNA (Xist) at the time! Thank you for adding another level of understanding."

Awwducational,fefryzk,t1_fefm233,1579063449.0," In male calicos they must have two X-chromosomes for the calico phenotype (one for each color) and a Y (or a fragment of Y translocated onto another chromosome) for the male characteristics. Being XXY in humans is called [Klinefelter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome) and most often results in sterility and/or poor genital development. I am not sure about the mechanism that causes sterility from the XXY make up, but that's the primary symptom. Klinefelter Syndrome is actually a fairly common chromosomal disorder in humans occurring in 1-2 per 1000 births."

Also I think the genetic nature of calico cats needs some clarification. Coat color is what is called an X-linked trait; the gene that expresses proteins for coat pigmentation is on the X-chromosome. Cats, like humans, generally* have sex chromosomes XY in males and XX in females. Having two X-chromosomes would result in females receiving a ""double dose"" of all the genes on the X-chromosome (there are about 1000 of them). So in cats, and in humans, one of the X-chromosomes is silenced early in embryonic development in all females. The X-inactivation is random so in some cells the X with say Orange color is silenced, in other cells a different X-chromosome with a different color is inactivated. Since inactivation of the X chromosome happens early in embryonic development when the embryo only has 4 or so cells, all the cells that divide from those early cells will carry the active X color from the original leading to clumps of colors that we call calico! The same is true for tortoiseshell kitties as well!

Here is the paper where the mechanism for X-inactivation was first described. Heavy duty science reading, but this is a really cool paper for those who may be interested https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80355-4


*Generally: Sex chromosomes do not necessarily correlate with the gender of the individual. It is generally true that XY is male and XX is female, but there are women with XY and [men with XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX_male_syndrome) and even more combinations of XXY and the like."

> Artificial selection for tameness in silver foxes indicates that selection on genetic variation in developmental genes may underlie both behavioural and morphological changes, potentially representing an important mechanism throughout animal domestication7,8."
Awwducational,fc8gnns,t1_fc7cvgm,1577534495.0,"No. A selective pressure is a reason for organisms with certain phenotypes to have a survival benefit or disadvantage. Some phenotypes (physical characteristics) are favored in certain circumstances, for example thick fur in cold areas, because regulating body temperature (thermoregulation) is a selective pressure. Selective breeding is not the same as  selective pressure."
Awwducational,fc317mc,t1_fc2md20,1577379128.0,"Hi /u/cam1xx. The source you provide is not quite up to the standard we require. Some of the facts it has are well sourced, but the relevant wombat fact is supported by a link to a local news reporter’s linkedin profile. That is not going to do the job, sadly. I did a quick wiki check and their page has good sourcing for your fact, indeed a more recent census of these wombats shows their population has had a slight bounce to 230 individuals as of 2015. Thank you for posting!
