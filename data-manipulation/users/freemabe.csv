DemocraticSocialism,fevf8a1,t3_eqhw2y,1579396705.0,"This first part is directed at anyone reading op's post and thinking ""How does investing in the stock market take advantage of people?!""

The idea of passive income (what I think most people think of when they think of investing) is inherently predatory.  Just think about it, you are taking some of your money, doing something with it and then being like ""ok now get bigger"". This just doesn't happen in the real world unless someone does something with that money, but in this hypothetical scenario, the person doing something with that money is either you, or paying you for the pleasure of working. AKA  you are leaching off of their work.   


As far as your question OP, I think you have some good ideas already, but you could look into more home upgrade type things like making sure you have energy efficient appliances, windows that don't let the heat out. You also use that money to take classes and learn new skills. Additionally if you expand what you consider an investment you could do things like donating the money to charities/causes you feel strongly about or politicians who support the ideas that you do."

What we need is more representatives that represent workers. Not every worker has finished high school. Not every worker is 40+ with 4 kids and a minivan. There will always be people that can answer governing principle questions, just hire them. What there isn't always enough of is people who are both charismatic and earnest in their pursuit of a better world.

More socialists in power is good, more old socialists in power is good, but not at the expense of younger socialists, unless you like alienating the young.

Maybe in the future when we have a monopoly on power like the capitalist do now you would have a point (although the thought that only those of proper education and age should be involved in politics is pretty bougie), but as it is right now, we need to fight for every scrap of power we can."

(Just like it's fair imo to blame Americans, like me, for all of the horribly evil imperialist bullshit that our government does around the globe.)

Israel is a colonial apartheid state and Zionism is a fundamentally racist ideology. At the end of the day all of these actions just give stupid, bigoted people reasons to feel like they are justified in their anti-Semitic beliefs.
