Raised by Elrond with his lineage kept secret for fear of his life.

Everyone in that country knows that their neighbors will snitch if they do anything bad. Everyone is watching each other, all the time. The indoctrination only does one part, and the slaves/citizens do the rest. Also does a good job of quelling any rebellion, because everyone is too afraid that the person they're speaking to is an informant. Also remember that Legion trade is heavily regulated to ensure that there's no chems or alcohol. They'd also probably screen anything educational from the outside, and outsiders smuggling things into NK is a big reason why a lot of people realised the outside world wasn't what the government said it is; and then started to defect. I doubt there's anyone that would risk crucifixion to let the same slaves who were going to string you up know that their god King is insane.
