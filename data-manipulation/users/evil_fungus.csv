AskReddit,ffy2zuf,t3_evnzey,1580337577.0,"Willful shittiness. Some people say such rude things, or act so unbelievably boorish and brash that simply speaking to them in any capacity is uncomfortable. People’s minds are so warped these days due to their over-ingestion of toxic media. Everything is either sex or youth or fighting depression. If people would get the fuck off their screens and go outside, they would find other people that have a lot to offer, but sadly the majority of the population is addicted to porn or alcohol or other drugs  (some people have more than one addiction.)  Addictions run our lives and make our social interactions miserable. People need to stop thinking that they can do unhealthy things and get away with it. Bad habits WILL catch up to you."

Unfortunately a lot of school curriculum involves it to some degree, and you need to interact with people on an almost daily basis. Set boundaries to protect yourself. Remember that nobody is scrutinizing you too closely, when you have to speak in front of people, just focus on saying the words right. Loudly and clearly, so everyone can hear you. That's the most important part."

AskReddit,ff51j47,t3_erhu3x,1579577715.0,"Once I had a crazy ass dream where I was literally in another world. It was magical as fuck and there was water...and of course there was a girl there. As I recall we were flying around and swimming in the air...I remember falling deeply in love with her in the dream and when I woke up I was so fucking unbelievably sad.

I still get sad when I think about it sometimes because I truly remember it so clearly...I always wondered what that meant, when you fall in love in a dream. I still vividly remember waking up afterwards... I was in a lake house, in California, deep in the woods, alone. I slowly opened my eyes and the second I realized I was awake I tried furiously (and with no avail) to go back to sleep so I could get back to the girl I'd literally left in my dreams. I almost cried when I couldn't get back to sleep. I remember the sadness, because it was such a real sadness. I'd had the perfect girl, for a night, and lost her...How cruel the mind can be!

I still miss that figment and she only appeared for that single night. I've never dreamt about her since then but the memory has strangely affected me and stuck with me all these years

I always wondered, what if she were really out there?"
