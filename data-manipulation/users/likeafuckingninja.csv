TwoXChromosomes,ff5xbj3,t1_ff4e0nr,1579613340.0,"I dunno about US daycare but in the UK I pay 52 pounds a day for my son - he's 2.5

He goes 2 days a week. Over the course of a year around 500 a month for 2 days. 

So full time is around 13k. 


It's a lot of money. You will get no arguments. But break it down. 


52 per day. For 10 hours and 3 meals. 
In a stimulating environment that protects My child, feeds him, starts early education etc. 

For 5.20 an hour. And that's gone down after he reached 2 because the ratio of carer to child is lower.

Child care is expensive. And it's not when you're consider what you're getting for that money. 


Of course not all day cares are equal. Mine is registered and government inspected and has certain standards to meet. Some other might be cheaper and simply provide a few hours of care with no frills. 


The nursery is open 730 to 1800. They need two shifts of worker to cover the hours and there needs to be certain ratios maintained. 

Foods needs to be purchased and cooked (do tenured professors also feed their students?) 
Those meals need to be healthy and nutrious. 

The building invites costs. The equipment has be purchased, maintained and replaced or repaired. 

They are expected to do early years educating. As well as safe guarding (my mother was responsible for ensuring children who had been removed from their homes had a safe environment to go to...what's your price tag for that responsibility?)

And fundamentally those children need to be kept safe and dealt with if they injure themselves. 


I think it's incredibly ignorant and short sighted to claim or imply  daycare providers are over charging or in someway ripping off parents. 

The people working there are often paid fairly little and expected to run around after 10 odd toddlers all day. 


In the US perhaps large chain day cares could be accused of upper management ridiculousness like many large corporations of that nature. 

But seriously. Break down. By the hour what you're paying for care and what you're actually getting.

Nope nope nope. We have a 2.5 yo. I feel your pain. 

He went though a phase where he wanted to come in with us at like 4am and my husband just caved cause like. It's 4am. 


And dude I get it. It's 4am for me to. 


I gave it a few weeks and then just straight up told him this isn't working. It will will never work and you are undoing the last 2 years of hard work we put into having this kid sleep in his own damn bed for 12 hours. 


Do you want a 7 yo climbing in whenever it wants? Do you want a lay in? Ever?  Do you want to sleep past 4am?! I do! And without a foot in my face and crotch at the same time thanks. 


So we booted the kid out and I said if you're not prepared to get up I'll do it. I did the first night and he saw a marginal improvement (5am!) And begrudging joined in. Now if it's before 6am kid gets shuffled back to his bed and usually goes without a fuss. 


It was much harder to get him to stop sitting next to our sons bed to get him to sleep. But we've slowly got there as well. I just have to keep reminding him this is groundwork for future good sleeping! And short term is crappy and long and there are tears but long term were building to 'night night' close door and walk away. Won't that be nice! 


And I let the rules go a bit on weekends. Kid comes in at 6 630 and can have snuggles and some bed am cartoons for 30 or 40 minutes whilst we wake up slowly.  We have lazy cheat Sundays so can the toddler :p may not work for everyone but ours knows the difference between a weekend and a week day so it's working for us. 



It's not a lot of use if your husband won't listen but maybe act like the toddler - say it louder and louder and louder until he gives in. You're completely right and he's causing more issues than there already are (depending on age it might a crap time for sleep anywya but the lack of consistency and the crying being reinforced with rewards isn't helping )"

And maybe some more context. 

Straight up my opinion of teens who think having a baby is cool or whatever or take no reasonable precautions is already fairly low - they annoy the shit out of me. So I'm already kinda on your side. 

BUT having made the fuck up she's now at least trying. 


But I think whether you can judge it as a genunine attempt depends on what's shes planning on studying and how she plans to deal with childcare. 

Does she thinks your parents will just raise her kid whilst she has a good stint at college and uni? Has she seen her friends go off and have fun and now feels a bit left out? Is this basically her going 'well that was fun but back to my old life now'?

Or does she have a solid plan, has she reached our for resources to help her, has she explained what's needed to help her, what courses I she's planning on doing, what jobs does she think these courses will get her etc. 


There is a huge huge difference in how reasonable this idea is depending on how it's presented. 


If she can't even put the leg work in whilst sitting around unemployed to gather that information I don't have a lot of hope of her succeeding at college etc. 


Your comment was mean, but honestly I said exactly the same thing to my cousin when she did the same thing (albiet older and employed) so I can't judge. As her sister if anyone's gonna say something like that you're best placed for it (I. Basing that on my family dynamics though so it may not apply depending on your relationship ).


 It's may not be nice and may not be called for but perhaps she does need some sobering commentary to make her realise how serious this situation is. 


At the end of the day going to back college now is going to involve the whole family supporting her and pitching in in a way they wouldn't have had to if she hadn't chosen to get knocked up (at least that's what you implied she did ) your parents will have to step up as care givers to some degree and you personally may find that means they have less time for you (not sure if you're older or younger ) and either your education or any kids you may have because they're running after her and her fuck up or potentially funding her in ways they may not have otherwise had also impacting your life. 


Whether she Likes it or not that kind of means you're entitled to an opinion and to voice it. But you do need to think about whether it's really worth it. How much do to you love her? How much do you want an ongoing relationship with her and your niece/nephew? If she's making a genuine attempt to fix the mistake and be mature about this..well better late than never. 


If not...I dunno. She's your sister and only you know how close you wanna be. 

I cut my cousin off in a heartbeat. I could see that train wreck coming and wanted nothing to do with it - she's done nothing but prove me right. But I'd be hard pressed to do the same with my sister even if she was being a immature twat about it. 

I also wouldn't let myself get drawn into parenting on her behalf though. Babysitting here and there fine. Routinely doing the school run or putting the kid to bed cause mummy's at a class or out with other students? Nope."

I'm on keto. Same reason. Post pregnancy weight gain. 
I in no way expect my husband to follow along. I need support in my choice in the form of stop looking at me like a crazy lady when I weigh out vegetables xd but I do not need him to mirror my diet to feel happy doing it. (He's a good weight.if he needed to lose I'd probably encourage him but ultimately dietary change requires individual will power and sacrifice not being dragged kicking and screaming. )


Now our son is 2.5 Largely he eats what we eat. Because that's how family food works. And I broadly try and keep a low ish carb diet going because I don't really feel stuffing him full of potato and rice and pasta and bread is healthy or nutritious. 
I keep fruit on the low side because of sugar and the fact he scams bananas off everyone and ends up with the runs. - we're potty training it's an awful mess! Xd

But otherwise he's an energetic lean kid who doesn't have an ounce of spare body fat on him. Who goes to nursery twice a week and is with grand parents otherwise - his diet is largely out of control (and will for most of the rest of his life, what's she gonna do when he goes to school ?) and yeah occasionally we feed him KFC as a treat every so often. And that's perfectly fine.


 It's a good idea to keep a handle on your kids diet or its real easy to end up with a kid who only eats nuggets and apple juice but aside from some medical trials and fledging evidence it may be good for kids with specific neuro issues like epilepsy keto is /really/ restrictive . Often banning foods like parsnip, turnip or swede - all good things to get your kids eating and instead focussing on kale, spinach and broccoli etc all stuff that's super hard to get a kid to eat. 

It also promotes high fat foods that aren't necessarily good for you - bacon for instance is low carb but it's hardly packed full of nutrients and goodness!

Plus it's rarely a good idea to raise an otherwise healthy child on a restrictive diet - it's just begging for eating disorders.

AskReddit,fetwoyn,t3_eqjamz,1579380804.0,"Literal answer - count calories. You almost definitely eat more than you think you do. And some food will surprise you with what it's got inside. If you obsessively log everything into a food diary the minute you eat it (or even before ) you're gonna start to see a pattern of to large portion sizes and little snacks here and there you didn't even realise you were doing. Once you have a handle on this you can ease off on the obsessive counting cause it can itself turn into a problem and ultimately you want to create a healthy relationship with food. 


Mental answer - realise this is a life long life style change. Yeah your diet can tighten and relax over the course of your life (live a little on holiday etc ) but make no mistake you cannot follow a 6 week diet to lose weight with the expectation you can go back to eating cake and not gain it all back. This is a commitment. Once you make peace with the fact there is no end in site ever it's actually easier to take each day as it comes as there's no dead line on this thing.

The old adage is you can't out run a bad diet. This is true. No amount of excercise will combat a diet of Macdonald's.

My grandad was illiterate and worked like super unskilled labour jobs. But he was the man and he worked despite my grandmother being far better placed earn more. 

In any case they were poor. My mother was 7 stone when she met my dad and eventually had me - pictures of her show borderline malnourishment. And she literally never believed she would ever leave the country, she couldn't believe she'd even left south east London. 
Her expected aspirations in life were 'try not to get pregnant, but either way eventually you'll need a council house' my grandmother refused to allow her and her brother to buy their council house because 'that was getting ideas above their station'

science,fetcoop,t1_fepckk6,1579373981.0,"It's  a food poisoning thing. 

Something's like alcohol, cigarettes and pot have documented physiological effects that are detrimental to a developing foetus and should be avoided 100%

Something's like medications should be avoided where possible to the highest degree. But a doctor may feel the benefit of the medication (maybe you're bi polar for instance ) far outweighs the risks. You'd be carefully monitored though. 


And something , mostly foods, are sensible suggestions. But ultimately it's up to you to determine the risk. 

Deli meat isn't going hurt you or the foetus. BUT it might be contaminated and that wouldn't bother anyone else by could fuck up a pregnant lady/foetus/young baby because their immune systems are lower or non existent. Especially in early pregnancy , food poisoning bad enough could prompt your body to abort in an effort to save your life. 


So this is the point where you evaluate WHERE your food came from. 

You can get food poisoning from almost anything if it's been handled improperly. But certain foods are high risk.
Shellfish, pate, smoked meats, unpasteurised cheese etc. 

If you were extremely germophobic about it your list of safe foods would be extremely small. 

So at that points its how much of a risk you're prepared to take.

Do you live in a developing country where local water sources are frequently contaminated with waste? Be super careful of basically everything. 


Do you live in developed advanced country where you have access to high quality produce with clearly marked origins and decent food standards? Deli meat most likely won't harm you. 

Are YOU personally prepared to take the chance for a turkey sandwich? That's something only you can answer. 

And no judgment either, I was incredibly sad by the lack of pate in my life whilst pregnant but continued eating all manner of cheese so those were my arbitrary lines xd 

And consider much pregnancy advice is one size fits all and is done for the lowest level - those developing countries. Breast feeding for the first year for example is a WHO recommendation based on lack of access to clean water to make formula in many developing countries - not really an issue in a middle class American suburb. 

The advice is also changing - raw eggs were recently removed from our list of food to avoid (cake batter and mayonnaise were the main food stuff being consumed xd ) as our quality of chicken and eggs has become so high they are no longer the vectors for salmonella they used to be. So long as you by the properly approved ones.

I wouldn't leave a camera in a bedroom up indefinitely. But to keep an eye on a couple of pre teen kids?. Sure why not? They get to play independently and feel trusted and you get the piece of mind that you can still keep an eye and intervene if needed. 


But with that power comes the responsibility. And this is where parents need to learn not abuse the power. 

If you see your two kids get into a fight do you immediately intervene or let them try and resolve only stepping in at the point you would have noticed without the camera and before someone gets seriously hurt?

If you see them doing something dumb that maybe they shouldn't but it's not harmful do you turn a blind eye cause without the camera you'd never have know anyway?

I think the same applies to cameras in common areas. 

Handy to check if someone breaks in, or you havent heard from someone when you should have. 

Should you be watching it and going home to bitch at your spouse about leaving their shoes on when should know better? No.
