I think/want to pack a bit lighter so the 30L bag from Topo really intrigues me. Although the Standard bag can expand, I've never had to do that.

I think much of the professional look depends on the colorfulness of your bag. You can get away with just about any bag if it's a solid dark color.

Unfortunately, my Garmin cannot keep a signal and keeps hopping to different satellites which makes my run look like a drunken toddler did it. And in turn, that makes the pace and distance tracking wildly inaccurate. 

The first day I ran, I set all kinds of “records,” only of course they weren’t. They were just equipment glitches. The second day I ran, I ignored pace and distance and ran for time and still set more “records.”

And today it was even more ridiculous: I set seven ""records"" including a sub-five minute mile.
