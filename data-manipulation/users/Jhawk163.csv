pcmasterrace,ff87bl7,t1_ff86u45,1579668057.0,"It really depends on other factors. For example servers have ""tick rates"" which is how many times they accept input from the players per second, so obviously if the server only has a tick rate of 60, anything over 60 isn't going to make much of a difference (you might get slightly results, but that'd just be from your inputs better matching the servers scan for them) however on a higher tickrate server, or in a LAN setting, it 100% makes a difference, it's typically part of the reason competitive games are played on LAN (There are other reasons, like elliminating latency and making it harder for contestants to cheat as well).
