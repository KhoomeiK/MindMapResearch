depression,ffhi4re,t3_etkvgj,1579936282.0,"It's just their opinion. I can say with 100% confidence that there is/will be someone who will like you the way you are.


Pro tip: regardless of how your friend looks like, you can easily hurt their feelings back by saying whatever critique you want. There is no objective measure for beauty, so if you tell her ""well your eyelashes are too long"" and she goes ""but that's a good thing!"" you can say ""no it's not, it looks weird"" and there you have it."

misophonia,ffezcok,t1_ffekdrr,1579871228.0,"Why do you think you are authorized to judge if he has Miso or not?


And if he does not have Miso, why is it that your problem is more valid than his? Can one not be annoyed if it's not Miso?


It is possible that he does not understand that headphones are your coping mechanism, so it wou5be beneficial if you explained that to him. If he insists that your headphones are still too loud, you two need to find a different solution that works for everyone because his complaint is exactly just as valid as your misophonia."

Advice,ff96raq,t3_esb1vn,1579706163.0,"I often have doubts about my achievements and skills.


I think it's useful to have a clear definition of what she finds to be signs of success and a clear definition of what steps she can take to obtain it. It's always ""easy"" to have vague fears and say ""No matter what I do I will never be good enough"" but in every single case there really is an ideal image in our head that is not equal to the image that we have of our current self.


If this ideal image can become obtainable, and if there are objectively provable steps you can take, then you can experience a sense of achievement and success."

internetparents,ff5107p,t1_ff44dwn,1579577320.0,"There are a couple of things I'd like to share


1, I was very lucky to find the therapist that I have now. She never once uses the word ""need"" and even when I do say ""I need something"" , she quickly corrects me to say ""I want something"". I think that's a huge thing and it helps a lot. Just the first thought I had when I read you wrote you were told you ""need parents"".


2, I was bullied a lot as a kid. So freaking much. And I never found the answer. I broke down crying when it came up with my therapist because I couldn't comprehend the cruelty of it. I never did anything bad, and I never deserved to be bullied. I often told my parents, my teachers, asked for help but they never offered me anything good. Now, after years of my own research, I have found that there are only 2 things that help: (1) either a complete change of mindset (where you make yourself think that you are not being bullied and you accept yourself the way you are so that you can laugh at the bullying - pretty much impossible when you are in that dark place) (2) or an environment change. When you are bullied in a place, it is because you do not fit in. If you move to a new place, you have a chance at a new environment and a chance at a new way of trying to fit in. This actually helped me as I turned 18 and moved out of my city and learned that I can belong to new places: not just my school or my workplace, but I can meet new friends in workshops, group sessions, etc.


3, That being said, I still feel like your situation is a bit different from mine. I don't think I have the similar amount of experience when it comes to not understanding why I am not accepted. It used to be the case in primary and high school, but now I'm pretty much aware of my differences and frankly I would rather stay like I am than fit in.


I do have a friend though who is similar to you, but she doesn't ever ask how she's being strange or weird, so in that way you're doing a bit better than her. It's a really strange place to be in when you are asked that, because (1) the other person is just one person and what they find weird might not be weird for others (2) no matter what the problem is, it's gonna be definitely tough to convey. I think if my friend really asked me what I find weird about her, and it really felt like I could tell her (she wasn't asking it out of frustration or a need for validation), I would love to tell her and help her, but until I feel like I can't tell her without breaking her heart, I will remain silent.


This might not have been what you were looking for considering the subreddit, but if I could help you in any way, then I'm glad."
YouShouldKnow,ff4z339,t1_ff3owr4,1579575917.0,I seriously can't tell which of these are real and which are jokes...
askwomenadvice,ff4yx37,t3_erfmc7,1579575800.0,"If she's anything like me, she doesn't like it when there's a pressure of ""will it be fun?"" for her. It doesn't matter if it's good or bad in the end, if there is a chance for it to go bad then she will be anxious about it. Try to minimize the chances of things going wrong or putting much pressure on it needing to go well, and she might feel less nervous about it."
misophonia,ff4u3si,t1_ff35w1j,1579572483.0,oh now that sounds right up my alley! thanks!

depression,ff2xdiq,t3_er2si8,1579527641.0,"Ugh same. For me the feeling comes and goes. Sometimes I forget about what a loser I am but the next moment I'll be talking with a coworker and feel actual physical pain because I'm that boring and lame.


I wish that, in those moments, I could just tell the other person ""I'm a piece of shit, just move along so that my torment doesn't continue."" but I know they'd take it personally, so I just nod and probably have a really painful facial expression."
depression,ff2wosq,t3_erbiwf,1579526972.0,"A similar experience I had, but I needed my therapist's help to see it: if I wouldn't be angry at someone for doing something wrong, why do I beat up myself for it? How am I in any way different from the people that are allowed to make mistakes?
