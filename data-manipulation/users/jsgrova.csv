CrossStitch,ffx85rr,t3_evpj91,1580319755.0,"This beast is almost exclusively confetti stitches--in what I've done so far there are maybe 3-4 runs of more than two stitches of the same color. (Who knew there were *this* many shades of blue?!) 

It doesn't help that I'm pretty anal about keeping the back neat, except for a messy bit towards the bottom where I started. I've only made one small project when I was a kid, so that mess shows where I was getting into the groove of cross-stitching hadn't yet figured out how to keep my threads neatly wrapped up. 

Between all that and all the knitting and crochet projects I've completed in the interim, I'm pretty happy with this progress so far!"
