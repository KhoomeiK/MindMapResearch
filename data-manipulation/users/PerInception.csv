I don't mean they have to like guns, or that you do, as you seem like you're not the type to own one.

If you yourself aren't a gun person, find a class for child gun safety and take them (it'd be a pretty short course). 


I had guns in my house growing up.

I never felt the need to sneak and grab one when no one was looking, since I could just ask and do it without getting in trouble anyway. There are literally 4 rules to gun safety, and if you follow them, there is no harm that can come of having / holding guns. 

Making guns seem mysterious, or making kids scared of guns, isn't a great idea (in my humble opinion). Let them be acquainted with them, how to use them properly, and make sure they have a healthy RESPECT for them. Respect instead of fear or intrigue. Again, at least in my opinion."

We were supposed to hold different things in our mouths in certain areas and the teacher would tell us what we were supposed to be feeling (sour, sweet, salty, etc).

Everyone else in the class was like ""yes miss teacher!"", and I was like ""Umm, nope, tastes the exact same to me!""... So I got reprimanded for disagreeing and ""just trying to be difficult"". Turns out years later, hey fuck you teacher there are no regions of the tongue and your taste buds are evenly dispersed!


Related, a few days later the teacher was asking everyone what kind of ice cream they wanted for a party we were having. A couple of people said chocolate, and I said ""I like vanilla!""... and again, I got reprimanded and she said ""you don't really like vanilla you just want to be different""... Um, no bitch, I don't particularly like chocolate ice cream and prefer vanilla. Also, I didn't say I wouldn't EAT chocolate, I literally just said ""I like vanilla"". If she didn't want to know what everyone liked, why fucking ask?
