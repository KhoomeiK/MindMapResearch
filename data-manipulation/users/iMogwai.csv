>Azaria Chantel Loren Chamberlain (11 June – 17 August 1980) was an Australian two-month-old baby girl who was killed by a dingo on the night of 17 August 1980, on a family camping trip to Uluru (then usually known as Ayers Rock) in the Northern Territory. Her body was never found. Her parents, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, reported that she had been taken from their tent by a dingo. Lindy Chamberlain was, however, tried for murder **and spent more than three years in prison**. She was released when a piece of Azaria's clothing was found near a dingo lair, and new inquests were opened. In 2012, 32 years after Azaria's death, the Chamberlains' version of events was officially supported by a coroner.

Second of all, your mother thinks you, a teenage boy, are a perv for watching porn? That's completely natural for a teenager, she should have been able to figure out you were doing it even without catching you (and thus known spying on a teenage boy who thinks he's alone is a bad idea).
