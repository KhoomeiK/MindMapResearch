That said, this is a REALLY bad move, and could end up jamming him up pretty good. Especially with Comedy Store guys, they don’t fuck around. He’s really pissing in his own pond. Do the work, Adam. They’ll come to *you.*"
WhoAreThesePodcasts,ffe6h4r,t1_ffe12jw,1579837978.0,"He’s incapable of having a regular conversation with anyone, and has no ability to just be himself. He’s always gotta hide behind this weird veneer of a “crazy radio personality,” and remember to be this over the top frat boy caricature all the time. It’s almost creepy/legit dissociative, and it’s so fucking boring. It’s not funny, it’s not entertaining on any level, and it’s entirely off-putting. There’s zero redeeming value to this hopelessly insecure narcissistic idiot. He’s so out of touch with reality it’s terrifying."

podcasts,ffawbai,t3_er95f1,1579745985.0,"[Comedy, Social Observation] **Live From The 405, Episode 228.** (NSFW) Free on iTunes & everywhere you get podcasts, except for Soundcloud for some reason. Here's the Libsyn link though: http://lft405.libsyn.com/live-from-the-405-episode-228

This is a podcast I do once a week, live in LA traffic driving around in my car or work truck. I'm an open mic piece of shit comedian, working 9-5 on the outer fringes of the entertainment industry. This episode, I talk about **Echoes In The Canyon,** and lament the cultural epicenter **Los Angeles** once was and is basically no more/long gone. It's a goddamn shame. I saw **The Two Popes,** getting ready to move to Canyon Country 40 miles away, and how my stand up has been going lately. (Better, I'm happy to say. Not for my audiences so much, but for me, at least) I had my **first beer at 40 years old,** and an unsuccessful bar tour of LA trying to acquire pussy. (Guess how *that* went) An eccentric & most likely homeless person at the intersection of La Cienega & San Vincente showed me how he invented his own math, on the back of a Lucky Charms cereal box. It was a helluva day in these Los Angeles streets, babes. Check it out if you have almost 2 hours to kill, and/or want to punish a loved one or family member."

AdamCarolla,ff9xuao,t3_esf98r,1579723847.0,"He signed an NDA so he can't talk about it, or if he did once somehow he certainly never did again.

howardstern,ff9uh2g,t3_esem0b,1579721627.0,"Same. On average I skip probably half the show. If it weren't boring bad enough already with the boring celebrity interviews, the boring repetitive topics like Peleton, Oprah, Metamucil, and The Bachelor, they now talk about politics almost every episode, too. I skip that *immediately.* The News used to be my favorite part of the show, now I'm lucky if I even get to hear 15 minutes of it. The second they start talking about politics, I'm out. It's a fucking shame, this show used to be so fun."
howardstern,ff9dzqf,t3_esblv0,1579710954.0,"Yes, Peleton and Oprah.

I love that I got downvoted into the negatives for daring to say ""there are good cops out there."" Hardcore is supposed to be about open mindedness and equality, but in actuality only when it's on YOUR terms. I'm willing to meet half way and say ""there's definitely bad cops out there that should be dealt with,"" I agree. But no one else wants to give an inch the other way. To just assume ""all cops are bad/evil/racist"" is as ignorant as the racists or fascists everyone claims to be dedicated to destroying, or whatever. I've always been fascinated by that hypocrisy."
