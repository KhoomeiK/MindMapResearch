FantasyPL,ffau9ir,t3_eryoqd,1579744629.0,The way this GW has gone I no longer feel so confident about TAA (TC)
britishproblems,ff71g74,t3_errywv,1579639228.0,It's been eye-opening to see how much people care about this.
videos,ff46p69,t1_ff45a82,1579556729.0,"Haha, cheers. Reddit will always be inscrutable."
videos,ff2apgs,t3_er7399,1579498909.0,This is like the British media (and public) on the whole Meghan-Harry thing atm
suspiciouslyspecific,fenhtl3,t1_fengup7,1579284997.0,"Haha, just because it's a British site doesn't mean they only do British food, which, incidentally, can be pretty good."
suspiciouslyspecific,fengpt1,t1_fen85jg,1579284317.0,Or BBC good food!
suspiciouslyspecific,fengibr,t3_epzl1y,1579284189.0,"I only read recipes on BBC Good Food. They have great recipes, including simple versions if you just want the basics. No waffle, just ingredients and methods :)"
FantasyPL,fek74uh,t1_fejqjcy,1579193999.0,"Oh man, if I want to keep Aguero this week and triple up on Liverpool next week then I'll have to take a -4."
videos,fdpgfro,t3_em9yo9,1578627969.0,"Was this inspired by James Acaster's netflix series, or is there a Smashmouth pandemic currently occurring?"
WiggleButts,fdo1ox3,t3_ema6g2,1578597263.0,"Oh yes, there is some mischief brewing."
Awwducational,fdc3ebo,t1_fda5vjs,1578266313.0,Nice! I could happily watch a heron for a while.
Awwducational,fd9jovl,t1_fd8lybi,1578234278.0,"You're right! Their iridescence certainly adds to their look, but in certain light the blue/green tones are not obvious and they are still a striking bird.

If we want to be more strict with the game, then I would suggest ospreys, coal tits, adelie penguins, snow buntings, and northern lapwings (also a bit iridescent) are some other cool looking birds with only black/white/grey coloration."
Awwducational,fd7hac5,t1_fd7gcjz,1578204495.0,"Yes, although I think it can be pretty tricky telling the difference between the yellow and the grey wagtail! (Unless you have some expert tips)"
Awwducational,fd7f0hk,t1_fd68n45,1578203450.0,"I saw my first grey wagtail a couple of years ago and was surprised when it was strikingly yellow! 

A couple of them hung out near our house for a summer, but disappeared over the winter. Loved catching a glimpse of them, and hope they survived."
Awwducational,fd7ek7z,t1_fd5fhsk,1578203242.0,"Magpies are also beautiful birds, but they're so common in many places it is easy to look past them."
FantasyPL,fcrah88,t1_fcr9e2a,1577899129.0,"Nice description, !thanks. Will help me to think more carefully about who I captain."
FantasyPL,fcr9dft,t1_fcr8tc1,1577898665.0,"Ah, so EO is a way of taking captaincies into account.

!thanks that makes sense!"
FantasyPL,fcr8c2y,t1_fcr7rfl,1577898259.0,Could you explain how this works?
FantasyPL,fcnd667,t1_fcna7r6,1577809187.0,"Yeah, Aguero has 'only' 10.7% ownership!"
FantasyPL,fcncyqv,t1_fcnarjc,1577809053.0,"Yeah, the plan was to take Aguero for a couple of weeks and then swap in Mane/Salah GW24 and the subsequent good fixtures.

Not sure if it's worth mucking around with my team that much though.

!thanks"
FantasyPL,fcna1dq,t3_ehu27n,1577807077.0,"What's the prevailing opinion on bringing Aguero in for a few gameweeks ahead of DGW24?

&#x200B;

Here's my team, by the way:

Guaita (Button)

TAA - Aurier - Soyuncu (Rico, Lundstram)

KdB - Alli - Richarlison - Maddison (Hayden)

Vardy - Rashford - Ings

FantasyPL,fc9ings,t1_fc9ha51,1577553224.0,"Haha, alright alright :)

The VC was a genuine mistake, but perhaps I'm being a little over-optimistic!"
FantasyPL,fc9guh6,t3_egpqwo,1577552478.0,I might have fucked up here. Somehow ended up with Soyuncu VC - not sure how that happened. Vardy C obviously.
rugbyunion,fc1uj8n,t1_fc106xb,1577330149.0,Didn't Stormzy just say he thinks 100% that the UK is racist?
FantasyPL,fc0zr54,t1_fc0y3xy,1577304152.0,No. Two gameweeks in one week. GW19 is Thursday and Friday. GW20 is Saturday and Sunday.
