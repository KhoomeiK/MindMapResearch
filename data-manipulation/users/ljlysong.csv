>Targeted transfer programs for poor citizens have become increasingly common in the developing world. Yet, a common concern among policy makers and citizens is that such programs tend to discourage work. We reanalyze the data from 7 randomized controlled trials of government-run cash transfer programs in six developing countries throughout the world, and find no systematic evidence that cash transfer programs discourage work."

> Again, show me the itemized list of items and services that will be taxed and at the rate they will be taxed. Until that information is available, this argument is hearsay. 

A **value-added tax** (**VAT**) is a consumption **tax** levied on products at every point of sale where value has been added. Any luxury item meaning conspicuous consumption or simply items that shows off how rich you are. From that 60"" Flat to the brand new IPhone. Tax every process that **adds value** a flat **10%**. 

&#x200B;

> That's the fucking point. 

Our current social programs places our lower-class into a loop. They become more and more financially stable then their benefits are removed. They become more and more reluctant to do better because they want to keep those benefits. 

You support then take it away. They're either on the higher spectrum of the lower-class or the lower spectrum of the middle-class. Struggle still happens but now they don't have any financial assistance when they still need it. 

Set the financial bar so if they have a accident or laid off they still have that $1,000 to lean on.

YangForPresidentHQ,ffvu10g,t1_ffvqor7,1580273236.0,"Take a look at Andrew's healthcare plan. Personally I believe it to the best healthcare plan. Just gets a bad rep because Andrew doesnt want to get rid of private insurance due to many families already negotiating for them. Itll suck if I choose to have lower pay to have better benefits.. then here comes the government removing my healthcare which I worked hard to negotiate to give me a public option which may not be better then what I had previously. 

Andrew like Bernie wants to allow the US to negotiate prices and if the companies dont want to, we take them and give the rights to another company who will. Refer to the global prices that all other countries pay for them. 

Also focuses on making things easier for doctors and allowing qualified nurses able to serve for preventive care or other simple procedures. Bringing accessible healthcare to rural areas. Bernie wants to give everybody free healthcare but some rural areas dont even have access to good hospitals for hours. 

Expand accessibility which will take time. Lower prices immediately, balance the market to be fair. Out compete the insurance companies to a point where it's essentially free. If the procedures and medications dont costs so much then the insurance companies dont need to pay as much. Cheaper insurance."

You probably misunderstood the language of the policy.

Welfare benefits manipulation is something lower-class Americans have done. The reason there is a cap. 

Welfare benefits struggling Americans who sadly fall into the circle of trying to earn on their own only to have financial assistance removed. It's a great thing if the individual is able to support themselves. Current wages can't support it. A $15 minimum wage still can't support it. 

Socially many middle-class Americans have a stigma towards people who are on welfare. See them as lazy and a waste of tax dollars. UBI is universal and discriminates against no one. 

You also have to include how the middle-class is doing. Just because you are middle-class doesn't mean you're more financially sound then the lower-class. The fine line between upper lower-class and lower middle-class isn't that far.
