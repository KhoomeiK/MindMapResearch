NintendoSwitch,fe95jea,t1_f80xgbe,1578934450.0,"That did not solve it for me. All it did was slow down my 5GHz band, which almost every device in my home (a smart home) uses. lol. Good suggestion though. I'm glad it worked for you."
facepalm,fe95aid,t3_eo01yu,1578934348.0,Imperial... it's called imperial. Think about why it might be called imperial. Just a fun side exercise.
facepalm,fe94yqu,t1_fe7w0tu,1578934284.0,did....did you really just say that?
facepalm,fdlds9s,t1_fdl0zgk,1578521867.0,"Real boomer or not, you scream Boomer. You think kids pay too much attention to their phones, you compared current skills to those you learned at their age, you complained they don't all stand for the pledge, you've argued that being forced to repeat the pledge is not indoctrination when it is quite literally the exact definition of indoctrination, and you've linked an expected lack of societal problems to high level of wealth. Maybe you should teach college instead, like I do, so you will have a higher probability of understanding societies change and the younger generation is their own person while you aren't entitled to them acting and learning the same way you do.

I maintain. Ok, boomer."

facepalm,fcvcq6s,t1_fcd34dn,1577999356.0,it really is stereotypical for a woman to expect a man to be a mind reader. I didn't say if it was or was not an accurate stereotype. I just said it's a stereotype.
NintendoSwitch,fccvs63,t3_eh2h7m,1577603239.0,This is the first home redesign I REALLY like. This is great.
facepalm,fccugqb,t1_fc6p935,1577602773.0,"I've been through shit in my life and guess what, I've never once expected someone to know that without speaking to me. So why in the hell would it be right for me to get upset with someone over triggering one of my less enjoyable memories? It wouldn't be. I promise many people have done it and I've never expressed anything about it to them. To my partner? Yes. To them? No.

This person's reaction is completely unwarranted, but I welcome you to try and change my mind."
Mustang,fcctvh2,t1_fcaanvc,1577602573.0,not a chance in hell.
Mustang,fcctrh1,t1_fc97tio,1577602535.0,"Yup. Nobody ever knows what Avondale is. ""new orleans' is a shit ton easier."
facepalm,fc61ezu,t3_egcc52,1577470093.0,What a bitchy response. Guess she expects guys to be mind readers. Pretty stereotypical.
Mustang,fc5t7up,t3_eg6xmy,1577465343.0,"I spent most of my time in 4th on the track in new orleans, a good bit in 3rd, and a few brief moments in 5th. It was a lot of fun. I hit a puddle at one point and was having traction problems that scared the shit out of me, but still a lot of fun."
Mustang,fc5t3mi,t1_fc581t4,1577465266.0,"I was going between 3rd, 4th, and briefly 5th on the track in New Orleans. I live in Seattle now and I haven't gone to any track around here yet. Track days are expensive and I'm still paying for 2 houses while I try to sell one. Speaking of which, want to live in Louisiana? lol jk...mostly."
NintendoSwitch,fc5o5e9,t1_fc4zy6z,1577462462.0,"As a man who has been on percoset daily for 4 years as well as a data architect who was dedicated to studying the supposed ""opioid epidemic"" for 2 years, your username makes me uncomfortable and makes me laugh. So, thank you for that (not sarcasm).

And seriously? The mods deleted a post like that? Surely they had to have a better reason than something like ""we don't like the topic"", right? I had two Lites. Both had the same exact issue. It started after the first post-release firmware update and wouldn't go away. People just blamed me and my wifi over and over. It wasn't that. I can promise it."
facepalm,fc1yoc4,t1_fc1hgr1,1577333883.0,"judging from the downvotes, not many people."
SurfaceGaming,fc18qos,t1_fc170h7,1577311485.0,"I can't answer such a broad question. Most GOG games are 32 bit and should be ok. Emulators I can't answer for, but I don't expect a problem.

I'd keep the X, but it's not a gaming computer. Neither is the 7"
