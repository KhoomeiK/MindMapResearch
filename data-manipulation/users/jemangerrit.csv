Advice,ff0keb0,t1_ff0iwmz,1579469700.0,It sure is OP's decision. And yeah I guess the girlfriend made the right choice for the long run. Ill try to remember this. Twas nice talking to you. Kind off a boomer thing to say but im glad you actually listen to what Im saying.
Advice,ff0i2qf,t1_ff0fqkr,1579469086.0,"Im guessing your brothers girlfriend knew you better then I know OP's friends parents tho. If you feel it is the right thing to tell someone then I guess thats the right thing to do. I do not know these parent though and maybe OP doesnt either, and its likelly she doesnt know the relation between friend and her parents as well as your brothers girlfriend knew the relation between you  and your brother. Also if I may ask, how did your brother react to you knowing?"
Advice,ff0glrx,t1_ff0cxlo,1579468666.0,"Im afraid there might not have been a situation in which he wouldnt have killed himself, it is impossible to have full control over a kid all the time, even for the best parents. The friends did all they could. Also, the kid being afraid that it would hurt his parents is a legit reason for him. Ofcourse in realitie most parents would be happier by knowing these types of things and helping their kid but in the kids realitie this was the truth. He might have killed himself even sooner is the parents knew. I feel like I might be overstepping a boundery here, talking about something I have nothing to do with but im not sure how to say this while being less intens. Hope you understand sorry"
Advice,ff0fa0c,t1_ff0aup5,1579468296.0,"I do not think knowing that their kid is in danger is more dangerous then knowing their kid is dead. And I think you know I didnt say that as well. I think telling the parents the problem can be more dangerous then telling them as little as possible while making sure the friend gets therapy. You seem to be talking about one experience, as much as you might have learned from this one situation, its still just one situation. I asure you that there are situations in which telling the parents will be fatal and have been fatal."
Advice,ff0bwgx,t1_ff08n3n,1579467417.0,"Thats absolutelly horrible. I understand how personal this is for you. I too have some very personal experiences with suicide. It doesnt sound like this kid had therapy. Depressed people should get therapy ASAP. If that means youll have to tell the parents, so be it. Im saying tell them as little information as possible, that can mean all the information, I agree with you on that one. Just rather not. If this kid had therapy, Im sure theres a very good reason why the parents didnt know about it"
Advice,ff09typ,t1_ff07h1c,1579466707.0,"If the parents refuse to put her on therapy because of not fully knowing why, which I highly doubt, then yes you should start telling them about the depression. Your mentioning how devistation it would be if the friend killed herself and she hadnt told her parents. The same is true if she killed herself ***because*** OP told her parents. And let me make this clearer, parents knowing that their child is suicidal can be reaaaal dangerous. They could start being control freaks, get angry, get depressed themselves. All things that could be the final blow. For god sake dont tell the parents without telling the friend."
Advice,ff05m93,t1_ff03sxe,1579465431.0,"As Im saying, a psychologist should be the one helping. Depents on the parents if they should. I didnt mention hiding pain. Parents are not everything and can be very damaging. You kinda sound like you're a parent lol, I understand your faith in people but I see way to many ways that could go south."
Advice,ff03332,t1_ff01pm2,1579464679.0,OP should tell the friends firts tho that she has to go to therapy. Maybe if this doesnt result in action she should tell the parents she thinks therapy would be good for the friend. But id still strongly advice giving as little information as possible. Deffinitelly dont tell them the friend is suicidal.
Advice,fezxoyw,t1_fev9b1p,1579463054.0,"Thats exactly what im saying. You dont know the relation between her and her parents, you dont know how they will react. Something heavy like telling parents without her knowlegde could be the very thing that pushes her over the edge."

TrueOffMyChest,fev3lev,t3_eqnydd,1579392700.0,"It's not exactly normal but it's far from unique. Lots of people have this. Do you want to care about life and other people? Im not exactly the most correct person out here but in my opinion it doesnt matter if YOU dont as long as you dont hurt people who do. Everyone has their own realitie, and all those realities are equaly true in my opinion since absolute truth is unreachable. So for example you might not care if you hurt yourself or others, but others do care so because thats their truth you are still actually morally wrong. Even if thats not your morals. But this is just kitchen phylosophy I came up with as I kinda relate to you. There are probably others who can explain it better"

Advice,feuxvhe,t3_eqo1wq,1579391012.0,"Depents on why your suicidal. Im guessing cuz of depression, but still very brought. Make your boyfriend force you to go on hobbies. 

As for the resentment part, I heavilly relate. But as long as your love for them is stronger then your resentfullness its okay. Theyll have to take it and I im almost sure theyre absolutelly willing to. Also, just accepting that you cant kill yourself because of them will make you less resentfull."
