starbucks,fgj8oek,t1_fgj35xz,1580839163.0,"Imagine getting down voted for having the lids tier 1 stores have had for a year now. Sorry your store is dead and corporate doesn't send you new stuff, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

Edit: btw this is directed at the people downvoting you."
starbucks,fgj80xh,t1_fgj23eq,1580838782.0,There's no nitro lids but stores shouldn't be using straw lids either. Trenta sip lids have been out for like a year now.
