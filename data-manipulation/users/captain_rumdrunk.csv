When I worked at Ross there was a woman who 2 times in the 3 months I worked there showed up with merchandise which was stolen from our shelves and demanding refund. Both times this person had tied up a manager and an employee for over an hour with bs because our manager thought ""today is the day I stop this"" then their own corporate HQ gives them no response while they're waiting to see if they have some way of proving the items were stolen (which I assume was also the reason the manager would go back into the office: probably trying to find the footage of when those items were stolen).

Seriously I was a ""store protection specialist"", nobody did jack shit but browbeat the shoplifters as they set to their very obvious task.

Her being the most real character makes it so everyone else in the show is an unlikeable cartoonish dope. And if the only relatable character is poorly written, has no motivation other than ""be evil-ish"", and obtains unrealistic advantages through minimal efforts in deception: then I have no choice but to dislike the show.

If your character is making your show lose a large portion of it's viewer base, that is not success. Smith does nothing but make the rest of the characters completely unrelatable due to how ridiculously easily they are duped.

That's poor writing. They explain nothing and think of how it would work for her to get out of these situations less. She should have been locked up and ignored the minute they got in the resolute. i hate that this series has already written her arch but I'm done.  


In my mind the series ended because Smith: a mentally deficient lady-child, managed to ask people one by one to check something in the airlock and blasted them out to space. Every time she asks the next person in line to go to the airlock and they're like ""wait no didn't you just kill that other guy?"" she just is like ""woops, must have been a malfunction, I've changed go ahead and try."" And with all the gumption of a South Park local each and everyone of them goes ""oh yeah that makes sense"", and goes right into the airlock.

She gets away with things in manners that even by todays technological and psychological standards would be nearly impossible to pull off, and she does it all as easily as farting into the wind.

Chief among these reasons are Smith and her manipulation ""superpower"", coming in a close 2nd would be the constant last-second peril that no longer holds any weight. Like seriously I was not tense this entire episode because even in-show smith basically is like ""well we got a robinson so we're gonna make it."" I can tell the ""science"" in this Sci-fi series is taken from cliffs notes of star trek and no actual research is done, so why not give us a show that's largely about the comforts of living in space with some crisis episodes used sparingly.   


Concerning Smith: I did a little research and it turns out that in the old series Smith was slated to die but was such a hit with fans they kept him in. New Smith seems to have the opposite reaction and I hope the shows writers and directors see this and make the right call to cut her out. I hope they do but now we get to see the downside to full season releases at a time. When you release 10 episodes you can't refine them as audience reactions occur, so since Smith seems like a favorite of the writers I doubt she'll be gone by time I actually finish the season, but I hope the feedback encourages them to drop the character if they make another season. (which it would be wise for them to hint at in a trailer for the next season so that people who left because of smith might come back in hopes she'll be gone shortly, and they'd have to get rid of her in episode 1). We'll see though, I'm holding out hope that they're trying to give Smith some canned redemption arc before killing her off so that all 5 people who like her can feel like SOMETHING happens in this show."

Also, if they don't get rid of Smith this season I might stop watching the show. Others have said it, and for whatever reason it somehow has given me motivation to keep watching (really getting bored, all of the good characters we care about have permanent plot-armor but act like the universes biggest rubes), but Smith is one of the least well thought out villains I have ever seen last this long. Her ""deceptions"" couldn't fool a real human child whose ever been lied to once in their life, her manipulation tactics are called out by the robinsons yet still entirely work despite them being ""wise"" to her shit, and she just non-chalantly gets away with things that make no sense.

I'm not trying to be rude or make assumptions, just think about what it is you really want, how other people have that thing, and ask yourself if what you want is really worth the effort you'll have to put in to get it.

A trick that might help if you want a better shot at happiness, (that helps me at least), is to be realistic with what you want and the effort you're willing to put in to obtain it. 

The rest of this might get a bit long so that's the basic message but read on if you want some more personal insight.

At one point in my life I tried to kill myself, mostly due to loneliness, but the fact that I had a decent paying job with full benefits only seemed to make things worse. I was in the height of my financial and independent success when I was most miserable. The reality is that the structure of ones day is flawed. The things people think they need, that they work in excess to obtain, are all superficial. They might be nice, but they are wholly unnecessary. Do you really NEED a room to show off all of your trophies? (and yes I consider collectible figures/libraries trophies). Are you even an exhibitionist? Or do you just want a big house with extra rooms because it's expected of you to want that?

See when we humans lived in caves we'd spend 3-6 hours a day foraging, hunting, and otherwise obtaining things to survive. That's anarchy though, and once the first big guy learned he could get out of doing any work by chasing off raiders in exchange for food and shelter? Well it was off to the races with ""law and order"".

We pay taxes essentially so that a group of people who don't want to do anything physical can tell the big boys that they spend those taxes on to hurt us if we don't pay up. This creates an illusion that we all need to be huge financial successes in order to just get by. 
In many cases these questions of financial oppression and job inequality have a simple answer: do what needs to be done. If your promotion means a friend gets fired could you say yes? Before you ask yourself that, think of how many times you've truly rationalized something that you knew better than to do. (like eating an entire pizza while trying to lose weight and telling yourself ""I'll walk extra tomorrow"" knowing full well you won't). A lot of people will get trapped in convincing themselves that they're not cunts and that others less fortunate than them have simply ""not figured it out"".

I think modern society has so much emphasis on the prospects of becoming rich and/or famous that it's digging it's own grave. We need to do shit like break the stigma around menial ""dirty"" jobs, encourage healthy work ethic instead of bending to ethical issues (I'll get a lot of shit for this one if anyone reads this far, but it's a good time to be PoC and/or female in the corporate world). The truth of the matter is that so many people are getting by without ever having to lift a finger because they're either putting in the work, (which often means they literally don't have the time to be sad about the fact that they have no social life outside of work), or they're willing to become despicable: spinning false accusations, throwing former colleagues under the bus, or using literally anything you can to make it an issue of race/sex to win a lawsuit.

Join the bumpkins in the woods and learn that life and nature can both be enjoyed without having to be so involved with the rest of this horrible species. Aspiring to be rich is no way to live at all: for if you're unwilling to put in the work to become something you're not then you should not be upset about not being that thing."

Thanks op, when this game dies because new players tell others to stay away from it due to ppl like you I know at least 1 person to blame."

The media portrayal of happy family times died out when our parents created a world where being poor is the worst crime a person can be guilty of. 

So either accept your gifts as godsends, or put in the work to join the happily rich. Either way where you're at now isn't unique, it's sad, but I've not spend a christmas with anyone for about 10 years now so maybe I'm hardened to it. Be that the case: you get used to it and eventually the holidays don't even seem to exist."
