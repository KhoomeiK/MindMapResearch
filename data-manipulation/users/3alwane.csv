selfimprovement,fco8l6z,t1_fchxhxn,1577826187.0,"It's a smart way to hack your brain, because one thing that I found is always your brain is looking for the things whether you don't have, or the things aren't existing yet which can be depressive, and the trick that you just shared will help you to not be a slave to this pattern and actually remain attention on the things that you achieved so far. 

Thank you for that tip it's really helpful."
