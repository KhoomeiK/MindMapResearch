warhammerfantasyrpg,fdn1onp,t1_fdmuwwh,1578574584.0,"That's one way to do it. Faith and superstition are huge in the warhammer universes.

The other way might be that the vampires believe they are weak to conviction, too. A placebo effect maybe. 

It could end up being that they wouldn't actually be harmed by garlic, or harmed any differently by silver. However, they have also heard all the myths and so they believe that garlic hurts them, or silver seems to hurt a lot more. It might feel real, but it's all in their head."

Lying in campaign advertisements is fraud and can, and should, have legal repercussions.

Allowing deceitful ads IS a corruption of free speech. The only way a democracy can survive is if the population has access to truthful information. These kinds of ads are an assault upon democracy and have allowed an authoritarian to have unprecedented control and a following that doesn't question its leaders.

Blatant lies and malfeasance should not be celebrated as excellent advertising."
warhammerfantasyrpg,fdhgm6d,t1_fdh4m5v,1578422218.0,"This idea has no tie to Warhammer lore, but what if vampires' weakness is conviction.

What if Neferata didn't have conviction in her own ability to garner power and, instead, relied on a potion to grant it to her. Her curse might become such that those with conviction would have power against her. 

Warhammer is a very superstitious world, so it's inhabitants would have great belief that silver, garlic, and the will of Sigmar could harm vampires. Thus, the conviction needed to counter her and her progeny.

As for the reflection, it could be a counter to the vanity and hubris used to attempt to cheat death.

Just an idea."
movies,fdf0zc9,t1_fdeyn7a,1578350853.0,"Nah, don't think so. 

I haven't paid any attention to this but, judging by the title, I can guess how it's going to go.

Bill & Ted had to get real jobs while trying to get Wild Stallions to world-changing status. However, it just never seems to get there. The world has moved on, but they haven't realized it yet. They're going to try that push for their generation of music, but they're the ones who will end up ""facing the music"".

By the end of the movie, they'll realize that music has changed since they started. Instead of trying to make Wild Stallions big, they'll give what they learned to the next generation.

That's what it seems like, at least. I think that would be a fitting ending if done well. 

Again, I'm just going by the title, the picture, and the previous movies."

CapitalismVSocialism,fckvvim,t1_fckqgui,1577734315.0,"The world is not without impurity. This is also why communism fails. In that system, everyone has to agree that they work for the good of all, but that is against some people's nature. Sociopaths exist. Greed exists. The will to dominate exists. These impurities should be ousted from the system, but they often play along with the rules up until it's too late to stop them. They will use the system to convert others to their cause who normally wouldn't buy into it.

The same is true of capitalism. The ideal would be to purge the system of those who would corrupt it, but that would be the same tactic that those who have corrupted the system would employ for their own gain. Or even someone who has the best interest of the ideal at heart can turn into the corrupting factor through this route.

You will never find a pure example of capitalism. Arguing about pure capitalist ideals is not productive. 

Even if you found pure capitalism, there is a lack of empathy inherent in it. You say there is give and take and that's it. What if someone can't give? Do you leave them out? For instance, the elderly population who can't work anymore and have run out of pension? Do you leave them to die? 

The parts need to coexist in order for the system to work. There needs to be balance.

Sorry if any of this is disjointed. Had to write quickly."
CapitalismVSocialism,fckfv32,t1_fcjlyzc,1577724401.0,"The Kipchoge analogy is flawed. Kipchoge would be working hard to make sure a rule is allowed that allows him to break everyone else's knees and chain lead balls to their legs. They got the lead ball attached to the rest of us, the knees are in the works.

You seem to capitalism in a very black and white way, but there are so many shades of gray in between that are important.

Our economic system is a mix of capitalism and socialism, with some other ideologies mixed in. There needs to be a balance to be effective. Capitalism is swinging hard right now and we need to fight back in order to keep it in check. If we don't, it will end up the same as the failed Communism and Socialism examples that we've seen so far. 

It's hard to fight because many people subscribe to capitalism above all. It has become so dominant in our culture that people don't even realize how much it effects our worldview or the people around us.

We judge each other based off of our job titles and the pay, real or imagined, that comes with it.

We celebrate corporations as worker-oriented, innovators, and job-providers. We give major corporations massive benefits while these stagnate the larger the corporation becomes.

I want to elaborate on this but I don't have time now so I'll try later."
