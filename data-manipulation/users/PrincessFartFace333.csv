I  did find you are going to want to ensure it has a good growing season before letting the animals on it.  So rope it off for at least a few months before letting the animals on it.  Another benefit is once it's rooted nicely and mowed regularly it will only grow as tall as you cut it, this will take a year or so to see these results."
