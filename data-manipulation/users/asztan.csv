SampleSize,ffbjmuo,t3_eson0k,1579768423.0,"Thanks for sharing, nice survey"
SampleSize,ff8ll8p,t3_es8ku9,1579684485.0,There's just one question? Shouldn't you also ask what age the recipients actually are? Idk how is this one question valid without any other data

Best_tattoos,fe2gqkb,t3_enawaz,1578838164.0,"I'm sure it's just a matter of perspective, but man does it look weird. I think the main problem is that you can't see its neck in the picture, which make it look so deformed. And the way its body just... end? in a random place? Idk, it seems off."
Needlefelting,fe1fx5e,t1_fe18l07,1578826043.0,Thanks for the tip!

nihilism,fdh83lu,t3_elbley,1578417420.0,"Edgy, but really don't see how is that nihilism. Why would freedom even matter if everything is meaningless. If you want to fight the system then go ahead. But you're not better or more awoke than other people just by doing this."

weddingshaming,fd80era,t3_ek4gq7,1578212418.0,If that's what they like I see nothing wrong with that. I don't think it deserves to be shamed.
SampleSize,fczj5cg,t3_ejmfni,1578102387.0,"Nice survey, but the part with faces fucked me up a little. Idk why, but trying to compare so simillar pictures made my brain go in weird direction and after a few the faces started to seem disorted and creepy."

My grandmas always told me to take a sip after every bite of a sandwich or something. It used to recommend in my country as a healthy habit. Turns out it makes you eat more and you may choke.

Good thing I always hated it and never done it."

catsareliquid,fc5e29a,t1_fc5dolu,1577454801.0,"No. Mods talked about it many times. It's just a picture of cat sleeping, just bc you title it ""my cat spilled"" doesn't mean it fits here."
