povertyfinance,ffi18lk,t1_f4xcjcu,1579962026.0,Study Mobile Device Management on youtube. It got me a great job. I have since gotten 4 more certs for the variety of MDM tools and really enjoy my job. I’ve taught the concepts to friends and seems very straightforward to pick up.
UpliftingNews,ffhygs6,t1_ffhczal,1579959272.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. I was caring for a kidney failure cat we named Fatcat and he went for a walk one morning and a lady picked him up. She thought he was a stray so took him to a vet, vet recommended putting him down based on his high kidney numbers. They didn’t even wait a day to look for an owner. She later saw my posts about “lost kitty needs subq medication” posts and had him cremated and brought me the ashes in a box with an apology letter. 

I run through a ton of “if only I...” ...had chipped him, had clipped on his collar that day, posted earlier. He went on walks around the neighborhood frequently and the neighbors knew him. 

Picked up all his medical supplies and sharps and saline in the house and donated those and all of his specialty foods and supplements to a local rescue. 

I’m saying this because you did your very best to make sure your dog was comfortable and loved and I know you feel guilty for the money that could have saved him. 

We visited a shelter and adopted a 7 year old cat that has been a joy. Sometimes I think if Fatcat hadn’t taken that morning stroll we wouldn’t know Peter and I have mixed feelings of good and sad. 

I wish you comfort and peace."
AskMen,ffhxfhj,t1_ffgequ8,1579958124.0,Its my first playthrough and I just finished the Bloody Baron questline. Great story and I can’t wait to see what’s coming next. Been playing till midnight.

LucidDreaming,fff79t5,t1_fff2wo4,1579877501.0,I will record a few key words and can remember those later. “Battle” “white horse” “roses” for example.
hometheater,fff5pzq,t1_ffd1gvy,1579876383.0,"We had the same colors you did and went with a nice warm dark brown. We liked it so much that we painted the outside of the theater the same “French Roast” color. We did the ceiling in “Black Magic” black to reduce glare. 

Looking awesome!"
DnDGreentext,ffdxkbg,t1_ffduluq,1579831420.0,Our DM slaughtered the party because he was upset we were not doing the things and progressing the way he wanted. My boyfriend playing even went to ‘check on me’ during the round and he said “you turn her over to see her face smashed/caved in” I stopped playing. It’s been 15 years or so now since I wanted to play D&D in person. Luckily I play online games with strangers and have a wholesome time.
mildlyinfuriating,ffbyfc4,t3_esjy49,1579786737.0,"I worked at a fabric store and we’d have to clean bolts of silky fabric just thrown on the floor. If there was a bolt with just a little bit of fabric we had to tack it on or else they would be stolen. We’d spent have the night rehanging merchandise, especially in the bridal area. 

The manager checked in the morning and if she didn’t like a drape she’d throw it on the floor at store opening and make us do it again. I liked the customers but disliked that manager so much for making us re-arrange even more than necessary. I wish I had complained back then but the others said corporate already knew and didn’t care."
RealLifeShinies,ffbw6az,t3_esp6ro,1579784780.0,TIL there are lobster farms. It makes sense just never occurred to me!
DragonPrince,ff9100w,t3_es6fwo,1579702113.0,"Great job!!

A nice trick for painting straight lines on objects is to use a book wrapped with a piece of cling wrap as an edge to run the paintbrush or paint bottle along. If you get paint on it just wipe it off and paint the next line. If you are right handed work right to left. Let the lines dry and go back for the criss crosses."

AirWatchMDM,feo199c,t1_feni1jf,1579293704.0,Sure thing. You should have an assigned TAM from VMware depending on your plan. Technical Account Manager.
JapanTravel,fegl91p,t3_ep2esx,1579096249.0,We are going in April and I’ve been checking out youtubers that visit Japan and making a list of the cool spots. Set goals...allow leeway for when things happen. Have a nice time!

AirWatchMDM,fefgojc,t3_eorjnk,1579055940.0,You may be able to use VMware testdrive to do this. You can spin up a test environment to connect to exchange and test. Once you are happy with it you can use those settings in Prod. Ask your TC if your plan includes test drive.
iguanas,feffem5,t3_eotrr9,1579055174.0,I used to carry my iguana around on my shoulder when he was a baby. Later on he would come to the door and bob his head to come out and hang with my friends. If you are nervous you can get a line with a small harness. Safety pin the end of the leash to your shirt. Back when he was little I just used a little yarn. :) Best wishes.
nutrition,fec6paz,t3_eoea3x,1578967570.0,The easiest way to get into fasting is by skipping breakfast and breaking the fast around lunchtime. If she had dinner at 7 that’s a 16-17 hour fast. Highly recommend mentioning that to your mom first. Reading all of those articles can be very intimidating.

movies,feat67g,t1_fe7k9s0,1578951989.0,The latest trailer has a new scene which really gives away a special character in the movie. It seems to me when marketing is giving away all the spoilers before the movie is released they think that people are going to go.
Canning,fearvu9,t3_eo7rlq,1578951683.0,"Try frozen raspberries and sugar - no pectin required. It’s the easiest to make when you are learning. 

Later on you might enjoy making jalapeño jelly. It’s delicious but you need to use a blender and cheesecloth to strain it."
