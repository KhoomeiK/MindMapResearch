socialanxiety,ffp1bjl,t3_etx6ki,1580084260.0,"I’m the same way. Im 16 and last year I couldn’t go back to my school because each morning before class I’d feel physically sick to my stomach. I’m now in online school and I need to get a job to pay for a car so I can help drive my 5 little siblings around. I’ve done lots of research and heres some of the jobs I’ve come up with that involves as little human interaction as possible;

• Hotel maid (my personal favorite because I can listen to music and tidy up without having to worry about working with others)

• Dog washer/kennel cleaner at a pet salon

•Someone that goes around straightening up the aisles/carts at grocery stores (Walmart, Target etc)

•Getting creative by making things then selling them on ebay (hard at first but this one requires no social interaction whatsoever)


Hope this helps.

P.S sorry I know how exhausting social anxiety is, I’m rooting for you!"

Those are my two suggestions that way you don’t have to stress out b4 work every day because you won’t be working with people, but you’ll still get the working experience :)"
