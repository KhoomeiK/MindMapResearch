moderatepolitics,ff4w42e,t1_ff4rwsm,1579573858.0,"Focusing on FB only for the moment:  Because you are on FB, other people are on FB. Because all of you are on FB, data exists about who you are, what you like/dislike, and often your exact location at any time (or really your phone’s location). FB now has this data, and in reality so do many others who do not have your best interests in mind. Once the data is collected, you cannot delete it and you can assume that everyone has it. 

Now, given this, let’s assume that you are special and incorruptible. The 5 other people that are there with you are. The last election is a great example of how we can believe that we are aware and unaffected by these manipulations, but in reality, people are being controlled. You will be impacted indirectly. 

Please, I cannot explain in a reddit post, but if you believe in peace, free will, and democracy, you must delete FB. Don’t take my word for it, but do your own research. Cambridge Analytica, run by Steve Bannon, should have been the last straw."

When you combine sugar with yeast you get ethanol (alcohol).  Alcoholic fatty liver disease is still caused by sugar.

So, basically too much sugar (in any form) is toxic to humans. If you want to slowly poison yourself, eat lots of sugar."

todayilearned,ff3hcfb,t1_ff24pox,1579541046.0,"Thank you for the detailed reply. I’m going to really put myself out there now and tell you what I really think:

I think that there is a small fragment of truth to this problem, but primarily I believe that this is really a self-fulfilling prophecy being created by a victim culture. A man with nothing left to lose is a very dangerous one and I think that many people see themselves this way.  This is my perspective as someone who lives in a very diverse environment (and in particular knowing many successful Vietnamese). 

I really hope the best for all people and I’d like to be part of making things better, but as long as people see themselves as victims, they will not be able to move forward.  Let’s talk about how we can create an environment where victimization is behind us."

On a related note, I have been wondering:  How much of the entitlements go to individuals to families that did not contribute (ie disability, etc)?  When we talk about the number of contributors relative to receivers I often wonder about the size of the receivers that did not/will not contribute or under-contributed. This discounts the fact that the system is designed to pay relatively more to those that contribute less."

Futurology,fe3ro8s,t1_fe3lg71,1578852185.0,"Society is more blessing than curse. I am often reminded of the story where after a battle the winner blinded the soldiers on the losing side while leaving some of the soldiers with 1 eye to lead the blind home. This was intended to weaken the losers further by forcing them to take care of the blind for the rest of their lives, similar to a White Elephant gift (curse).
