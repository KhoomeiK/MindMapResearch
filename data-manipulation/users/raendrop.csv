It's not just about the karma.

It's not just about the age of the account.

It's about having actively participated on reddit for long enough to have gotten sufficient experience to understand the ins and outs of how reddit works, what's expected, what's permitted, what's frowned upon, what's forbidden.

Your account is 1 month old and you have nothing to show for it. You might as well have just signed up.

Moderating your own subreddit is advanced stuff. Learn the basics of reddit first. Once you've accumulated enough karma, the option to create a subreddit will become available to you.

But also consider why you want to make your own sub, and look around to see if a sub on that topic already exists, and join it instead.

This is not a dis on placebos. There is value in using external tools to help you deal with things in your mind. Even basic meditation makes use of some sort of focal point.

If you find it doesn't work for you, then perhaps candles don't resonate with you. Try something else that resonates with you better. Your tools need to be symbolically meaningful to you."
