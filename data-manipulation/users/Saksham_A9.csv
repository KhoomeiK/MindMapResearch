There will also be posts about interesting images of fun and unique posters ppl came across. We'll take this sub wherever the community sees fit, r/Poster doesn't necessarily have to be about just one thing, it can be about numerous other topics as well... Hope that answers your question :)"

SubredditAdoption,fdxxw1n,t3_encia6,1578774023.0,"I've got a few ideas for r/Webs; we could use some or all of them: 

It can be a platform where ppl post images and links to webpages, and websites, or absolutely any content on the web/internet which is funny/wacky/unique/interesting. It might also be sites many ppl hadn't heard of, and it might benefit them 

It can also be a place where we talk about the Spider-verse... Like theories, to fanart, to facts, anything 

It could also be a place where ppl share pictures of rlly unique spider webs or any cool naturally formed structures or even human-made architectural wonders 

PS: If you like any of these ideas, upvote!! 
I'll also be making a good number of ppl moderators, if I win..."
