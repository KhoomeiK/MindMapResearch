That's a stretch if I've ever heard one."

ockytop,fgmqcad,t3_exo798,1580929901.0,What are the odds that Wideman does become a two sport athlete? What are the NCAA regulations in something like that? And when was the last time we had a two sport athlete?

The replies to this tweet are hilarious. FSU fans are extremely salty."
ockytop,fgml8p3,t3_ez9gj9,1580926853.0,At least 4 CBs for Wideman to UT came in early this morning
ockytop,fgmhp0i,t1_fgmgolk,1580924777.0,I agree 100%. He always had the most insane dunks during warm-ups.
CFB,fgm6i29,t1_fgm4nif,1580918874.0,I believe so. The rain was to wash away the sins of his time here
CFB,fgm3iwe,t3_ezaxyk,1580917316.0,"Tennessee vs LSU in 2017 was surreal.

It was raining so hard that half the stadium lights went out. I was for sure that they would postpone the game, cancel halftime, etc. But no, we still played our halftime show in a borderline monsoon, and the second half went on. At the same game, a piece of our scoreboard came off and hit an LSU fan in the stands.

This was also the day after my 22nd birthday, and I was incredibly hungover."
CFB,fgm39tx,t3_ezb34r,1580917158.0,Tennessee vs Florida 2016
ockytop,fgm31ih,t3_exo798,1580917011.0,I honestly think the basketball player that I'm most excited to see develop for the next couple of years is Davonte Gaines. I feel like he has an incredibly high ceiling and the potential to be really explosive. I just hope he doesn't go the Kwe Parker route and transfer out before he starts to get meaningful minutes.
ockytop,fglzomk,t1_fglxz91,1580914837.0,"John was 6/8 on FTs, 8/9 FGs, with 22 points (a career high)

CollegeBasketball,fgkv8je,t1_fgkte6g,1580874378.0,I fully admit that there was poor officiating. I'm just saying you ALSO lost from these other factors.
CollegeBasketball,fgks8sj,t1_fgkmwzn,1580872462.0,"If it makes you feel any better, you also lost because you were heavily out rebounded and had almost double the turnovers."

CFB,fgjdw02,t1_fgjdpoo,1580841995.0,You're right. The ball just appeared in the WRs hands in the endzone.
CFB,fgjawkv,t3_eyu6hp,1580840367.0,"> The NFL’s calculations for individual scoring do not award any points to a quarterback who throws a touchdown pass.

But I'll just leave it at that, since I don't come to r/cbb to discuss politics."

With that said, I don't attribute that to today's loss against Mississippi State"
ockytop,fg7ek8a,t1_fg7dzuz,1580590595.0,I'm still not impressed. He's missed some VERY easy points. Should probably have double what he was now.

ockytop,fg7cicw,t1_fg7cckz,1580589207.0,I don't even think we're playing bad defense. State could throw a backwards lob from half court and make it right now.
ockytop,fg7bp4c,t1_fg7bi21,1580588655.0,"Except we literally fixed out biggest issues from last game. Vs Texas A&M we struggled heavily with offensive rebounds. In this game, we have 15 second chance points."
ockytop,fg7blkp,t3_exavl1,1580588588.0,"I don't care what anyone says. I don't care if it sounds whiny. Fouls change a game drastically. If the refs are going to call foul after foul on us, and nothing MSU, that leaves us scared on both ends and lets State know they can play aggressive and pretty much do whatever the fuck they want."
ockytop,fg77oi6,t1_fg77gw2,1580585926.0,"I just think he has the same issue that JJJ had at the beginning of the season. He doesn't really have experience playing at this level, so he's scared. He will become more aggressive and play better as he gets more confidence."

I'm not a bad player, but I'm relatively new and was bad not that long ago, so I'm stuck at these low levels and have to climb out, which can be very frustrating."
