swans,ffniej3,t3_el616y,1580066333.0,"I love “The Most Unfortunate Lie”. It’s a beautiful song with gorgeous guitars, lush soundscapes, and brilliant lyrics. It’s a fabulous closer, for White Light From the Mouth of Infinity."
swans,ffndntb,t3_et90jc,1580064597.0,Two of my college friends didn’t like “Better Than You”. One of my friends liked “Oxygen”.

Currently, I’m listening to Soundtracks for the Blind by Swans, and I’ll eat brunch with my mom."

I’m happy for you. :)"
TrueFilm,ffdu5is,t1_ff98zhf,1579828999.0,"You should add The Holy Mountain, El Topo, The Colour of Pomegranates, The Tree of Life, and Le Cercle Rouge to that list. :D 

Le Samourai, Marketa Lazarova, Eraserhead & A Woman Under the Influence would be great picks, as well."
TrueFilm,ffdt7n3,t1_ffbme79,1579828326.0,"You should watch Rebecca, after Psycho. Rebecca is a dark, disturbing film with wonderful cinematography, a fantastic performance from Judith Anderson and gothic elements that add a creepy ambience to the film.

The Birds is good, as well, and its scenes with the birds are great examples of masterful filmmaking."
TrueFilm,ffao9e9,t1_ffandei,1579740611.0,"I wasn’t a huge fan of the prequel trilogy, but I will admit that I have to re-watch the prequels. I liked the sequel trilogy, and I really like The Last Jedi. I like how The Last Jedi tried to do different things, with the lore of Star Wars."
TrueFilm,ffa8q76,t1_ff92j37,1579730070.0,"I saw Underwater this month. I get why you dozed off in the middle; Underwater was boring, and it wasn’t a good film."
CasualConversation,ff9z9xv,t1_ff9qwuw,1579724693.0,"Oh, okay. That's fine. I liked The Force Awakens, and I thought that The Last Jedi was an impressive film. I liked The Rise of Skywalker, as well. I respect your thoughts, though."
TrueFilm,ff9j6g5,t3_escfyv,1579714140.0,"Robert Bresson was a great director, and I really admire his style. His films could be bleak, harsh and unforgiving, but I really like his straightforward, ""less is more"" style. In Robert Bresson's films, it's astounding how a gesture or a facial expression could speak volumes about what the film is trying to express. I haven't watched the entirety of Four Nights of a Dreamer, though, and I haven't watched The Devil Probably. 

I'm looking forward to re-watching Return of the Jedi, as well. Re-watching A New Hope & The Empire Strikes Back led to falling in love with Star Wars again."
CasualConversation,ff9i8d5,t1_ff9c7dw,1579713575.0,"You saw the original Star Wars films in the theater? Awesome!! How did you feel about the original trilogy, when you were younger? I haven't watched The Phantom Menace in years, but you should try the sequel trilogy."
TalesFromRetail,ff9bep5,t3_esc357,1579709122.0,"Wow.....

Sorry about your co-worker."
college,ff9b5n5,t3_es78zw,1579708962.0,"Congrats, dude!! Keep it up! :)

TalesFromRetail,ff90iar,t3_eryg0c,1579701724.0,Karen was crazy.
offmychest,ff8uffy,t1_ff8qx2k,1579696454.0,Ouch. :( Sorry that you had to deal with that. Your partner is a dick.

CasualConversation,ff8h087,t1_ff8fi6r,1579678088.0,"Hayden did his best, with the scripts that were handed to him. 

I get what you’re saying about Anakin, but Hayden’s take on Anakin was....questionable. I haven’t watched the entirety of the prequels in years, but I think that Anakin’s portrayal In the prequels was flawed. There were times where Anakin was annoying, instead of compelling (or interesting)."
CasualConversation,ff8f657,t1_ff8e8h9,1579675844.0,"Fair enough. Revenge of the Sith does have a great story, and it has a tragic vibe. However, I think that there’s bad (if not horrible) acting, during the Mustafar scenes. 

Again, though, I haven’t watched Revenge of the Sith in a long time."
CasualConversation,ff8e2r2,t1_ff8dtgg,1579674601.0,"I haven’t watched Revenge of the Sigh in a long time, but in my opinion, there’s no way that it could match the original trilogy."
CasualConversation,ff8ak0t,t1_ff8aago,1579670972.0,"I haven’t watched the prequels in years, but I liked the sequels. I wouldn’t worry about those angry & upset fans, though; you’re allowed to express your opinions, and people should respect your thoughts. 

The original trilogy was great, though. I think that people will continue to enjoy A New Hope, The Empire Strikes & Return of the Jedi.

It would be cool to see a couple of Star Wars spin-offs that went into a completely different direction, though. I’d love to see a Star Wars film that was directed by Ari Aster, Alejandro Jodorowsky or David Lynch. A surrealist/experimental Star Wars film would be great, as well."
swans,ff8a4ow,t3_enf9i4,1579670568.0,"I think that The Glowing Man is an awesome album. It’s the perfect ending to Swans’ 2010-2017 incarnation, and I love how on The Glowing Man, Swans went for a massive approach that was even *more* ambitious than The Seer & To Be Kind. like how several portions of The Glowing Man went into serene, ethereal territories, as well."
swans,ff89qlj,t3_es6jvl,1579670197.0,Have fun. :)

I’m proud of you. :)"
CasualConversation,ff88r30,t1_ff88fpc,1579669302.0,You’re welcome. :) I highly recommend watching the original trilogy. A New Hope & especially The Empire Strikes Back are fantastic films.
CasualConversation,ff885j0,t3_es719y,1579668772.0,"That sucks, dude. Sorry that you had to go through that. 

I was watching The Empire Strikes Back tonight, and I loved it. I think that The Empire Strikes Back is a fantastic film, and the Star Wars original trilogy is bound to cheer you up."
CasualConversation,ff881ee,t3_es4409,1579668670.0,"Great advice. Thanks, man. :)"
TrueFilm,ff87yux,t1_ff5rj2v,1579668608.0,"I think that Hereditary, Midsommar, A Ghost Story, You Were Never Really Here & An Elephant Sitting Still are modern films that really stand out. Burning, Good Time, First Reformed & Little Women were unique, as well."
TrueFilm,ff87rsh,t3_erdo08,1579668438.0,"The Empire Strikes Back is a brilliant film, and it’s an extremely entertaining adventure movie that has a good amount of depth. I love almost everything about The Empire Strikes Back, from its storytelling & pacing to its characters. The Emoire Strikes Back struck me as having a higher amount of maturity & sophistication in comparison to A New Hope, and The Empire Strikes Back deepens the lore of Star Wars without falling into messy territory. 

I really like the cinematography of The Empire Strikes Back, and The Empire Strikes Back is a great example of the magic & the wonder that we’ve associated with Star Wars. Say what you will about George Lucas, the prequels & the sequel trilogy, but I think that a lot of us won’t deny the strengths of the original trilogy. 

Also, The Trial is a terrifying, surrealist masterpiece. Its visuals are astounding, and The Trial is a great mixture of inventive filmmaking and satire. The Trial definitely deserves a higher amount of attention, and Orson Welles was a genius."

daughters,ff77a1q,t3_eot9f2,1579642523.0,"Your best bet is to try the Jesus Lizard, the Birthday Party & the Stooges. 

Sonic Youth is great, as well."

Sorry to hear about that. I’d recommend talking with friends & family, pursuing new hobbies & doing what makes you happy. Try to get out of the house as much as you can. 

Hang in there."
TrueFilm,felc40f,t1_fek1t7r,1579218696.0,"You’re right. Initially, I posted minor details about Parasite, but I edited my comment. My bad."
TrueFilm,feitacj,t1_fehko17,1579146639.0,"I saw that film. Aguirre is a fantastic film, and I love how it was a dreamy, but disturbing descent into hell. 

I can definitely see how Aguirre led to Apocalypse Now."
TrueFilm,feisxb4,t3_ep2s3c,1579146376.0,"I saw Parasite!! 

I think that Parasite is a *very* well done film, but I can’t classify it as a masterpiece. 

I think that being on this subreddit so much has helped my understanding of films, and it’s turned me into a tougher critic. I want to spend more time watching great films, but it’s easier said that done, due to my local theater being a mainstream one & the responsibilities of adult life. 

I’m looking forward to re-watching The Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi, and I think that Michelangelo Antonioni was an incredible director. L’avventura, La notte & L’Eclisse were incredible films, and I love how Antonioni portrayed loneliness & existential despair. Zabriskie Point looks like an interesting film.

I want to see Satantango, but 7+ hours.....holy shit!! How can I prepare for that?"
TrueFilm,fec9q29,t3_eo4l9g,1578969167.0,"I’m looking forward to what Florence Pugh does, in the future. She was amazing in Little Women, and it would be *awesome* if she collaborated with David Lynch, Terrence Malick or Denis Villeneuve. 

I’m going to see Parasite for tomorrow, and I’m looking forward to that. I really want to see A Hidden Life & Portrait of a Lady on Fire, as well."
AskReddit,fdoy6wp,t3_embv3x,1578615579.0,"Weezer - “Buddy Holly” 

:)"
TrueFilm,fdfqj5r,t3_ekum46,1578367786.0,"I watched 3 Women tonight, and it is a *very* interesting film. Parts of it confused me, but Sissy Spacek & Shelley Duvall had great performances in that film, and I liked how 3 Women explored the loneliness of Millie & Pinky. Some of the shots of 3 Women were beautiful, as well, and the ending was fantastic, but it was......odd. 3 Women definitely gets better on a re-watch. 

Also, in general, I’m looking forward to exploring films that were released in 1977. 1977 seems like a fantastic year for movies, and I want to watch Ascent for tomorrow. Ascent seems like a depressing film, though (to put it lightly). I want to watch Stroszek, House, That Obscure Object of Desire & Sorcerer, as well. 

Also, 1973 was an excellent year for films, and I think that I should revisit The Exorcist. I want to watch the rest of Papillon, but Papillon looks like an intense (and uncomfortable) film."
TrueFilm,fd6d1ze,t1_fd6bdww,1578189113.0,"What scenes did you feel weren’t necessary, for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood? I get that The Hateful Eight drags the audience out so that we feel the claustrophobia and the tension, but I think that The Hateful Eight is a big too long; it does drag on at times, and the payoff wasn’t that exciting, IMO. 

As for the feeling that I get, Inglourious Basterds does have a huge cast, I think that its story was good, but it didn’t blow me away. I wasn’t blown away by the plot of Inglourious Basterds, and I think that the length wasn’t necessary. 

I was referring to when Manson’s disciples were attacked, at Dalton’s house. I liked how Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was a lot more relaxed and easygoing than Pulp Fiction & Inglorious Basterds, but all of the violence towards the end of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is distracting & unnecessary."
LifeAfterSchool,fd676or,t3_ejr5g7,1578186519.0,"You shouldn’t feel bad. Everybody’s different, and there’s nothing wrong with staying in on a Friday night. 

Don’t compare yourself to others, because you aren’t getting the full picture of their lives. Nobody is perfect. Do the things that make you happy; whatever floats your boat."
TrueFilm,fd66dkw,t1_fd65lvi,1578186161.0,"Hey there. I feel that Inglourious Basterds & The Hateful Eight could’ve been shortened, but I think that most of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was needed; only the part where Manson’s disciples were attacked wasn’t necessary. 

I did want a convo, and I wasn’t looking to vent. I just felt this barrier to a bunch of his films, and I couldn’t really connect with Tarantino on an emotional level. I was thinking about Tarantino earlier today, and I realized that I felt differently about several of his films."
Florence_Pugh,fczvz1y,t3_ejivq2,1578109548.0,Happy birthday!! :D
TrueFilm,fczg8ic,t3_ejfvlu,1578100573.0,"I get that Star Wars has been discussed a lot lately, but my God, A New Hope is an excellent film. It does have bad dialogue, but the dialogue is charming, fun and it has a lot of personality. The storytelling/pacing/characterization is excellent in A New Hope; the story is incredibly tight, and it doesn’t waste time on anything. A New Hope has a sense of wonder & magic to it that persists in 2020, and A New Hope is how you can make a great adventure film. 

Day of Wrath is a great film, and it has exceptional cinematography. I liked Rebecca a lot, and I think that Rebecca is my favorite Hitchcock film (so far)."
daughters,fbzjt53,t3_ec80ib,1577249091.0,"This is fantastic. I’m really excited for Daughters’ fifth album. It would be awesome if Daughters went for a post-punk/gothic rock sound, and I’d love to see a Daughters album that emphasized melody. Also, I’d love to hear a Daighters album that went for a scary vibe. 

All of the stuff that Nick talked about provides so much potential, for a reinvention of Daughters’ style."
