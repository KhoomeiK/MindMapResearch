FemaleDatingStrategy,ffezvgz,t1_ffebocq,1579871709.0,Exactly. Hookups are easy. Relationships with an actual quality person is work.
cricut,ffapwzl,t3_eskgjf,1579741726.0,GORGEOUS!!! So clean and organized.
AskReddit,ffanyx8,t1_ffajgt5,1579740416.0,Thank you! I sent you a PM.
AskReddit,ffai8sl,t1_ff9ib5e,1579736354.0,I work as a graphic designer/textile artist for a fashion company. Would you mind if I got in touch with you to ask some questions because I'm feeling really complacent career-wise. No worries if you don't feel up for it but I would really appreciate it :-)
FemaleDatingStrategy,ffabuvr,t3_eseal2,1579731872.0,Wow that went from 0 to 60 in no time flat.

ThriftStoreHauls,ff7nydr,t3_es0iz4,1579654102.0,Somebody else's face has been in that mask but it looks really good on you!
beauty,ff7jvk4,t3_es0j0h,1579651271.0,"To be fair, most of Reddit thinks that people looking after themselves is selfish. That includes exercising beyond just being healthy (for cosmetic reasons), plastic surgery is frowned upon, desiring to be a beneficial relationship is ""gold digging"", you get what I'm saying. You can't admit to vanity or wanting better for yourself without ruffling a few feathers. What do these people expect? For you to see things from their perspective and change your entire stance? I guess so. Will you do it? Probably not!"
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff6nl5r,t3_erv507,1579631018.0,"LOL my best friend always asks about how I can possibly date men who aren't attractive to me at first. She can only date men she considers ""hot"" in the beginning. (This is surprising to me because her husband is not what I would call ""hot"" but to each her own.)

I have to be honest, this was my mentality at first but I've seen the light. Attraction goes further than physical for me. I can eventually find someone handsome as long as he treats me well and courts me properly."
YouOnLifetime,ff6jyld,t3_erqzxc,1579628809.0,He kind of looks like a male Kristen Stewart!
AskReddit,fektj67,t1_fej5bel,1579207293.0,The thought of hemming my own dress gives me anxiety. I keep seeing the uneven edges and the thread bunching up.

HydroHomies,fefxkjb,t1_fefbrnc,1579068544.0,I drink a gallon a day and I have a desk job. I don't think that's a lot if you're actually thirsty.
AllFantasyEverything,fef4tdy,t1_fedoe50,1579048193.0,I feel like David or Ian would pick the food the Lost Boys ate in Hook. (Why does this seem so familiar? Did they actually already do this....?)
AllFantasyEverything,fef4dp3,t3_eogo5v,1579047901.0,"The pizza the Ninja Turtles ate. The cheese always looked so good.

Edited to add: all the food Garfield ate. Also, the green stuff those people at the spa ate in Batman: The Animated Series. Yes, it made them sick (or something) but it looked tasty."

BlackPeopleTwitter,feet4jv,t3_eoipk3,1579040644.0,I haven't been suspicious but I've been annoyed if they keep pushing the friendship...especially if I'm busy and all of a sudden they're acting all needy if I don't answer their texts within minutes. Like what do you possibly need at 2pm that cannot wait for an answer after I'm done with work?
