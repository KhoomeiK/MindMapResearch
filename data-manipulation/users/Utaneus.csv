You say we wouldnt have evolved to be so inefficient, but fast definitely do pass through the digestive tract unabsorbed in some cases. For one, fats aren't absorbed with 100% efficiency like many sugars are, so if you have a large meal with an excessive amount of fat then a not insignificant amount may pass through unabsorbed. Also, many medical conditions interfere with fat absorption. In short, there will still be plenty of fat in the shit flowing through the sewers.

WTF,fep7m8u,t1_fep6zb7,1579313944.0,"Thanks, that makes sense. When I hear these things about not pressurizing below a certain *altitude* I was wondering why altitude mattered since partial gas pressures only matter in relation to elevation and not altitude.

It kind of prompts the question of why they don't use the term elevation in aviation, especially when altitude becomes important in certain situations and you'd be left having to disambiguate.

Just looked it up and in aviation they specify which definition of altitude they are using, so I guess when talking about pressurizing cabins we can assume that pressure altitude is what's being discussed, i.e. elevation."
WTF,fep6v1w,t1_fenh6j6,1579313462.0,Altitude is distance from a certain point on the ground. Elevation is distance from sea level. At least that's my basic understanding. So I dont think it's accurate to subtract a city's elevation from a plane's altitude and use that as the plane's effective altitude. I could be wrong though.

Cheese is basically coagulated casein along with variable amounts of other milk fat, proteins and moisture.

Cooking,fdnlc9k,t3_em9zg8,1578588201.0,"They won't go mushy, in fact they get more firm and rubbery the longer they spend in a hot broth. 

Whether or not you shell them first depends on two things:

1) How much do you want the shrimp to flavor the broth?

2) How much do you (or your guests) mind peeling the shrimp throughout eating the dish?

Leaving the heads and shells on will add great shrimp flavor to the broth. If you already have enough of that in there then this isn't really necessary. You can also remove the shells in advance and use them to make the original broth then strain them out. If you want a hassle-free soup that isn't interrupted by peeling and discarding shells, then I'd suggest peeling them first. 

As far as cooking time goes, with shrimp it's really the less the better. Add the shrimp to hot soup like 3 minutes before serving."
