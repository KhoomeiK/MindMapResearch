Define ugly? We live in the most aesthetically obsessed era of all time. As a civilization we’ve become creatures who succeed or fail solely based on looks. 

I won’t sugar coat it. It’s my policy. We live in a rough time to not look up to “social standards.” I can speak on this with authority because I was diagnosed with alopecia at the age of 10. Basically without my immediate health at risk, since the age of 10 I began losing my hair rapidly over the course of public high school. This was more than acne or being overweight, this was a young man who had poorly drawn on sharpie eyebrows. No eyelashes. Patches of bald spots around my head. 

Did I lose out on the girls I wanted? Yes. Did I have to compromise my happiness and tuck away whatever pride I had instilled in me? Yes. Was I the most uncomfortable person to even be around out of sheer awkwardness? Yes. By social standards; I was UGLY. 

Today I’m 25. I have tattooed my hair and eyebrows. I still have no eyelashes. I’ll summarize a decade of pain, therapy, and inevitable rehab stories;

Some things we can’t control. Our height. Sometimes our weight. Our health. And we sure as shit can’t control our luck. 

I absolutely hate cliches, but I took all that pain and made myself into something amazing. Someone amazing. I date the most beautiful women in a 500 mile radius of my residence. I hit the gym I worked on my mentality I made a life worth living and have a story worth telling. 

So basically my guy, you are at the gorgeous crossroads of life. What you chose to do with the next move is going to define a lot of things for you. Trust me I acknowledge and respect your pain, it’s familiar. In 10 years I hope you can look back at this post you made and smile with your amazing life and beautiful family who finds you absolutely beautiful. It’s not easy. It’s going to be painful. But God willing you make it on the other side, 
You just can’t help but laugh. 

Best of luck king."

As of yesterday I am a 25 year old completely hairless sex icon!! And I can promise you microblading saved my life and gave me the confidence to move on. 

I began losing patches at 10. Throughout HS my eyebrows, eyelashes, and general body hair slowly but surely all fell out. I was blessed to have an in shape body and nice face structure as you have yourself. 

My senior year in HS (2013) I found out about microblading, at the time one of two clinics in America. Thankfully it was NY based where I reside. The company at the time was called HIS HAIR, today bought out by Bosley. A good $5k and 4 sessions of a meticulous tattoo process of injecting ink into small dots over just about every follicle.  To this day it holds up as a nice low buzz cut. The difference between bald by choice, and in pictures it really does shape the face. 

2014 I proceeded to get my eyebrows tattooed through a separate company who specializes in both male and female eyebrow microblading. For males such as us, each “hair” stroke is symmetrical but purposely spread out differently for a more realistic illusion. 

It has been 8 years and I have yet to have a touch up on my scalp “tattoo” however every 2 years I must have my eyebrows touched up due to the strokes fading slightly rather than the dots on my scalp holding up nicely. 

Microblading is a fairly new procedure becoming more and more popular. I have tattoos on my arms and I won’t lie, microblading your face and head hurts like a mf!! But I promise you the peace you get knowing you always 24/7 365 have absolutely “perfect hair.”  Between the years I spent drawing my eyebrows on with ink that would sweat off and cause a mess, and having a hat glued on to my head, I am thankful for my decision to undergo the procedures. 

I’d say go for it my dude! It’s an expensive, wildly uncomfortable, painful process. But then again... so is living with alopecia isn’t it?"

I run to my phone the second I hear a notification only to see it’s just “teamsnapchat”

I don’t think people are any one thing forever. It’s who can survive through the dark moments. But some people have a reason to go thru a day, even if it’s 2 texts 6 hours apart from each other all from a person who doesn’t really like you. Anything to get through the day."
depression,fcrnby2,t3_eieavt,1577904063.0,"I’ve been genuinely happy for a combined total of 6 months. In 24 years. As my friends all spent time with their family and partners as they always do, I was by myself. No reason to look at my phone. Everyone who uses me January-December got everything they needed. It got real quiet. I took some Xanax and alcohol and somehow climbed on top of my rooftop at 11:59 as I was smoking a cigarette I felt peace. Maybe I was too drunk or maybe I meant it but I jumped off my roof at 12:03. I’m absolutely fine. Maybe this year I find a higher roof."
depression,fbgssuq,t3_ed8qxj,1576857757.0,"I lost my hair at 10. Alopecia. Super rare autoimmune disease. I’ve lost opportunities because of it. To this day. Matter fact to last night; a beautiful girl looked at me and asked why I was bald. 


But I get wonderful girls beautiful amazing 10/10 women. You can turn the pain around brother. God bless."
