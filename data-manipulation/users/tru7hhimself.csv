i come from a guitar background myself so i fully understand how it's matters there. for synths it's different, often more dependant on human hearing rather than the instrument or sound system. sometimes you have a wide range where it doesn't matter but for some synth patches certain melodies sound better in some keys (although you usually have upwards of half an octave where it sounds good. for instance some paino/bell with a lot of resonance sound might have an awesome pure quality at A, but sound obnixous when you go up to D or just too low and muffled if you go down to D below).
additionally you can start hearing the bass spikes when you go low enough with a patch and the point where that just starts to become apparent often gives you the most interesting textures. it's even more extereme with the sort of fm-sounds often used in psytrance. sometimes you have only a few notes where you get that magic gritty texture. everything below will sound like ""toktoktok"" and everything above like ""brzzz"". but, unlike the thing with the bass, you can often remedy this by spending some time working on the patch."

for plugins: don't make the mistake that almost every beginner does. namely hunting for plugins to improve your sound. it's not the plugins, it's your ability to use them. you can make a great track just with stock plugins.

that said, psy basslines are a bit tricky and don't work nicely with every synth. zebra, serum, sylenth or hive are good here.

the second thing is figuring out how to make kick and bass that don't sound amateur anymore. a big part in that was realising that if there's too much of a given frequency then it's not the only option to turn it down with eq but you can also make the time the frequency plays shorter. if you just rely on eq your kick can be wimpy and lifeless once you get rid of its boomyness. the second biggest part here was putting quantity over quality. it's easier to get a good kick/bass combo by making a few good kicks and bass patches and trying out all combinations than fiddling with one patch forever. if you start with good sounds and find the perfect match you don't need much or sometimes even any processing on either of them."

facepalm,fdh9gmp,t1_fdgy02r,1578418262.0,we domisticated sheep 10000 years ago in the stone age. you can't criticise stone age peoples fighting for their own survival for that. also a wild animal doesn't take kindly to selective breeding by humans if you don't provide an andvantage for it. but if humans provided protection of predators (including humans) and access to good food it must have been mutually beneficial relationship back then.
facepalm,fdgxr0j,t1_fdgwt6f,1578410920.0,"the sheep are here now. if you want to want us to stop sheering sheep for wool, you have to either just stop sheering them and cause them to suffer because of excessive wool coats or you have to kill them all. if you don't want to do either, you have to sheer them to keep them comfortable but being living organisms they will reproduce â€” so that's exactly what we have now. sheep will not turn back into their wild ancestors because we leave them alone, just like stray dogs will not never revert to being wolves."
facepalm,fdgwr7s,t1_fdgvs2q,1578410233.0,then what? all sheep would magically just disappear?
facepalm,fdgwbnr,t1_fdgpvv7,1578409933.0,"the same is true for many other animals and plants. not all of whom were domesticated deliberately. some like cats and rye have domesticated themselves, simply adapting to an enviroment where humans are prevalent. if you want to stop that you have to eradicate all humans from the planet.

facepalm,fdgvppo,t1_fdgsnde,1578409505.0,"if they are of the opinion that sheep shouldn't have been bred in the first place, what's their solution? go back with a time machine and tell the stone age sheep herders to leave the sheep alone?"
facepalm,fdgvi2g,t1_fdgtf6b,1578409354.0,"what do we do with the sheep if we stopped keeping them? kill them? let them die of heat death because we don't sheer them anymore? those sheep are here now and they're not going to stop reproducing because we wouldn't want them anymore. we are responsible for breeding sheep with thick wool coats, so it's our responsibility to care for them now."
facepalm,fdguzz3,t1_fdgu0lv,1578409000.0,"of course we need to sheer them. the desire to sheer sheep for their wool is exactly why we bred then that way.

i've always been wondering what does peta want to do against it? kill all sheep? i think the sheep would rather be sheered than killed."

btw: a raw saw wave does sound jarring."

psytranceproduction,fcrom1p,t3_eikw29,1577904545.0,"for samples: make your own! psytrance (except futureprog) is not boring cookie-cutter music. making your own unique psychedelic sounds is key to making an interesting track.

for plugins: don't make the mistake that almost every beginner does. namely hunting for plugins to improve your sound. it's not the plugins, it's your ability to use them. you can make a great track just with stock plugins.

that said, psy basslines are a bit tricky and don't work nicely with every synth. zebra, serum, sylenth or hive are good here.
you'll also want something that does fm nicely. maybe a good synth for that is already included with your daw, but if not zebra, serum, bazille and many others should get you what you need."

edmproduction,fclobkb,t3_ehr5sa,1577752510.0,"the first thing is moving my monitors to a new room and putting them in the correct position for mixing instead of compromising between mixing and music listening for the whole room. as a result getting a good mix is much easier now.

the second thing is figuring out how to make kick and bass that don't sound amateur anymore. a big part in that was realising that if there's too much of a given frequency then it's not the only option to turn it down with eq but you can also make the time the frequency plays shorter. if you just rely on eq your kick can be wimpy and lifeless once you get rid of its boomyness. the second biggest part here was putting quantity over quality. it's easier to get a good kick/bass combo by making a few good kicks and bass patches and trying out all combinations than fiddling with one patch forever. if you start with good sounds and find the perfect match you don't need much or sometimes even any processing on either of them."
psytrance,fckoyvj,t3_ehjzo0,1577730058.0,"putting elements up or down in the ""stereo"" field is easy to do. higher pitched sounds automatically appear higher than lower ones. with volume, reverb and frequency content (further away is more silent, has more reverb and less high frequencies) you can also put sounds closer or farther from the listener. you've got a whole 3d space to put your sounds in."

edmproduction,fcaypvg,t3_egv4rl,1577579254.0,"ime it works best with two projects. one for making music and one for mixing. for me mixing is the boring part that requires more concentration and less creativity. so i often put it off for later, which incindentally helps by providing a fresh perspective.

also that way i can sometimes squeeze two sessions in a day if i have time. i can mix during the day (more work on speakers and little on headphones) and write during the night (more creativity then, also more work is possible on headphones so no complaints from neighbours)."
