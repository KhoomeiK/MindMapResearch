dogs,ffbtsqu,t3_esr0yn,1579782481.0,I wouldn’t swear off all responsible breeders because of this one experience.  The breeder’s expectations for pick up were a little high and they should have made it clear how long it would take before the day of.  They should have made that information available to you when you first started contacting them. I’d say next time you should just ask what the pick up routine is like during the initial conversation.  That way you know what’s up and can make your decision before you’ve committed to a puppy.

Unfortunately, you can’t save every dog, and there are far more adoptable, lower risk dogs that need to be pulled from shelters. Taking an experienced foster from the list to handle a potentially long-term project dog that can’t be around other dogs could easily be a death sentence to many more dogs with more easily addressable problems.

It’s not responsible to push a dog with a history of potentially fatal attacks toward other dogs onto another person.  Even if it goes to a single dog home, the potential for attack and liability if the dog gets out is high. 

It would be different if the OP wanted to keep the dog and work with a behaviorist and manage every aspect of the dog’s life, but there aren’t many people who can watch one of their dogs brutally attack another and ever completely love or trust that dog again.  The OP obviously cannot and does not want to keep this dog. I don’t blame them.  This type of experience is extremely traumatic.

It sucks, but the reality is this dog has shown itself to be life-threateningly dangerous to other dogs. The average dog owner is not equipped to handle this type of rehab and training, and the experienced person who can and will provide the training and management this dog needs is extremely rare. Not to mention the increased liability of owning a dog legally deemed viscous... As tragic as it is, sometimes euthanasia is the best option."
CrossStitch,feyuhwe,t1_feyrdty,1579450681.0,"I admire that you’re planning to do more than one in a year.  This’ll be my first SAL and my largest piece to date so feels a bit overwhelming to start, lol."
CrossStitch,feypcgz,t3_eqrhcp,1579448625.0,"Looks great! 
I need to start on this SAL before they send out February’s portion. I’ve been distracted."
CrossStitch,fe9ixbg,t3_eo4cvi,1578937902.0,"I’m still a beginner, so I’ll let everyone else give kit suggestions.  I just wanted to give a warning so you don’t repeat my mistake.

Don’t buy cheap floss sets on Amazon.  I have what is supposedly 300 colors I got for Christmas that are labeled with DMC numbering. I spent two days of inventorying and trying to eyeball the correct numbers after finding a dark brown numbered as a light gray. I still have about 20 I can’t figure out the right number for. Now I have a bunch of floss I’d rather not have and a Michael’s down the street with all the DMC colors I could want."
CrossStitch,fdwllde,t3_emzy6s,1578759916.0,"I read the instructions for every project and my backs still look horrible.  I’m just so bad at planning.  The other day I was stitching the outline of an oval in one color and instead of going around the shape like a smart person I skipped six or seven squares, back and forth with no thought to how it would look.  And this project is 3 strands, so it’s not great. Lol"
cardcaptorsakura,fdwcx9i,t3_emx7kf,1578757467.0,"I loved the American dub when it was on TV.  Until I got the first movie and my friend and I decided to watch it in Japanese.  We couldn’t have been older than 11, possibly younger.  It was eye-opening and I ended up collecting the uncut subbed DVDs after that.

That said, I bought the Blu-ray release of the first movie and watched the dub for nostalgia.  Nelvana dubbed the movie uncut and released it with the sub under the CCS brand.  And it shows. If they hadn’t butchered the episodes with unnecessary edits and removal of any romance that they could get away with, I would have ranked it with the Pokémon or Yu-Gi-Oh dubs (not totally accurate translations but still fun to watch)."
dogs,fdn2jzb,t3_em64cv,1578575376.0,"Our corgi is going through a cracked tooth right now. I can only imagine how bad it feels. I feel horrible that we didn’t notice until he just stopped eating. He has an extraction scheduled on Wednesday.  Really wish it could be sooner but his blood test came back with high white blood cells, so the vet wanted to treat with antibiotics first. 

I will definitely be sure to get our other dog’s teeth thoroughly checked on our next visit."
science,fdn0pn0,t1_fdmpckc,1578573661.0,"As an anime fan who did all I could to fit the normal category, this is 100% accurate. There was a large group of anime fans at my high school that I couldn’t connect with because of the over obsessive way they acted. I had a couple friends in the group that I liked hanging out with 1x1 but I just didn’t fit with the larger group."
thesims,fd9i9lu,t1_fd9917n,1578233697.0,"I think they could still do a farm pack if they got creative.  Like make chickens be for egg laying only, have cows be for dairy and bulls for breeding and showing, sheep for wool, and a way to sell animals rather than butchering them. It’s completely possible.  I’d be more concerned with whether or not farm animals would be considered part of your household sim limit."
CrossStitch,fd3lgeu,t1_fcz1n0n,1578159449.0,"Also, thanks for the suggestion on how to renumber.  :) I found what I think is the correct 415 and I’m slowly inventorying everything else."
CrossStitch,fcz24y1,t1_fcz1n0n,1578092139.0,"You’re probably right about it being a Chinese brand.  My parents got it off Amazon.  I should have gone the extra mile and found DMC listings for my list, but I’m new to cross stitching and just didn’t think about it."
dogs,fcljuok,t3_ehtqx8,1577749475.0,"Is there anything different about her? New hairstyle? A hat? Perfume? Etc...  Dogs are really good at noticing differences, and new things can trigger unwanted behaviors.  Also, when you say attack, is your dog actually trying to bite your friend or charging and then backing off?"
dogs,fcldegp,t1_fclaoow,1577745217.0,"Are you getting the pup from a reputable breeder?  If so, you have a better chance for a sound temperament to work with since good breeders aim for proper temperament. Avoid Petland/other pet stores selling dogs.  The conditions their dogs are bred in are way more likely to produce pups with unsound temperaments.  I wish you luck. :)

I got my girl from a rescue with no knowledge of her heritage other than her mom was a Bassett hound.  I did a DNA test and she’s Bassett/Beagle on one side (her mother based on the info got from the rescue) and German Shepherd/Collie/unknown mix on the other.  There’s lots of potential for issues with that mix. An unsound GSD alone would be enough to create the high strung, anxious girl I have."
dogs,fcl96qr,t1_fcl1ve2,1577742531.0,"That’s definitely true.  It’s an extremely appealing thought, and I’m sure there’s something truly rewarding about rehabilitating a fearful dog if you have the extra time and experience.

In my case, I was too inexperienced to discern puppy shyness from full blown anxiety. It was only after I brought her home and bonded with her that I realized how life crippling her anxiety was for her.  By then it was too late for me to want to rehome her, so I’ve been doing my best since.  She’s a great dog otherwise."
dogs,fckltc2,t1_fckjleb,1577728123.0,Yep. It’s extremely heartbreaking and bad for depression and/or anxiety to show up to puppy class and watch all the others playing happily while your fearful puppy cowers behind you.
dogs,fckh4pi,t3_eho07v,1577725210.0,"I’m the odd one out that’s going to say no. I have social anxiety with a side of depression and I happened to pick a puppy that also had social anxiety/neophobia. So I was too socially anxious to get her out and socialize to try and curb her anxiety which added to my depression.  It was only after I started taking antidepressants that I could sort of get her out and about, and by then her anxiety was out of control.  She’s usually so over threshold by the time we get somewhere that it’s just easier if we get all our exercise in the backyard. 

We feed on each other’s anxiety now.  I suspect if I’d gotten a dog with more confidence, I might have had better luck in helping my own mental health but I love my dog so that’s just where I’m at."
thesims,fck9mrp,t3_ehj27a,1577720283.0,Beautiful! I wish I could build like this.
CrossStitch,fcalirz,t3_egvim6,1577571610.0,"I have the same problem. Sometimes I’ll turn the hoop over and go at it from the back.  It’s way easier that way to get the needle in right when there’s a lot of other thread around it. Otherwise, I just go slow and make sure everything’s right."
pokemon,fc6yoc8,t3_eggjnb,1577492908.0,"My thought was maybe it’s a reference to Cornish knockers/US tommyknockers.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker_(folklore)

They’re not really described as having long beards, but they can be helpful or mischievous depending on the folklore, and they’re found in the mines."
