Cosmic horror has been getting a *ton* of love lately, and it's about to get a lot more thanks to Richard Stanley. Color Out of Space was breathtaking. It's not perfect, but it's so goddamn close that you can taste the love. And while I haven't seen Underwater yet I am firmly convinced that the critters I saw in the trailer are Deep Ones. And in recent years we've had Banshee Chapter, The Ritual (arguable but tonally cosmic horror), Resolution/The Endless, Spring, Black Mountain Side, and of course The Void (which I absolutely agree was a great movie).

If anything, we're on the cusp of a beautiful resurgence of weird and cosmic horror. As H.P. Lovecrafts' mainstream popularity grows, so too does the popularity of general weird fiction and horror."

horror,fevxdzz,t3_eqb9y4,1579402700.0,"Friend of mine recently had me watch Terrifier on Netflix. I liked Art the Clown just fine, but overall the movie was lukewarm for me.

A few days ago I was browsing the horror section on Tubi and I came across All Hallow's Eve. Looking at the cover art, all I could think of was ""that looks suspiciously like Art the Clown from Terrifier"".

Turns out that's because is *is*. Director Damien Leone remade his own goddamn movie and changed the name."

horror,fdqu08f,t1_fdpin5f,1578674847.0,"You recall (somewhat) incorrectly.

While it's a loose adaptation of Shadow Over Innsmouth, Dagon figures prominently as the Elder God being worshipped by the natives of a small fishing village, whom are all in various stages of transformation to go into the sea. There's *fantastic* use of practical effects to illustrate the various stages, and the furthest along are not recognizable as human.

The recent Scream Factory Blu Ray release features a couple minor changes that make a major difference in the climax of the film. There is still some fairly terrible CGI work that remastering didn't do much to improve, and Deep Ones aren't portrayed the way folks in /r/Lovecraft are used to, but it's still one of the best Lovecraft adaptations and was directed by Stuart Gorden, the same guy that directed Re-Animator."

entertainment,fcna9ks,t1_fcmimkf,1577807234.0,">They are both deceptively simple.

I disagree. The Mandalorian *is* deceptively simple. Many episodes are quite minimalist, which is an aspect I love about the show.

The Witcher is *not* simple, in fact it's far too complex for its own good. The multiple timelines they employ throughout the season, for example, only serve to convolute the over-arching story, and are often confusing. In this I would agree they are being deceptive...but not in a way that is enjoyable and certainly not in a way that is simple."
entertainment,fcmc6aq,t1_fcm3jrh,1577770179.0,"I'm a *huge* fan of the books *and* games, but I had to drag myself through The Witcher in spite of Cavills' performance and dedication.

I'm not really much of a Star Wars fan, but I absolutely devoured every episode of The Mandalorian, and found myself disappointed every time an episode ended because I wanted more.

I dunno. All I see and hear is praise for The Witcher, but to me it felt like a less competent attempt at cashing in on the Game of Thrones audience.

Edit: Look, if you like Netflix' show, fine. *I* didn't. Downvoting and trying to convince me I'm wrong isn't gonna do anything but reinforce my opinion that the show isn't as good as it could have been, and the people heaping praise on it and shouting down anyone with a different opinion don't really understand what makes for a subjectively *good* or *bad* show."
thisismylifenow,fckbpow,t1_fcjy5x2,1577721717.0,"Reposted from my comment above, because I dislike misinformation:

Corgis were literally bred to heard livestock, and to bark like crazy to alert their owners when something is wrong with the herd, when a stranger approaches, when a mouse farts down the road, etc...they weren't bred to be cute, they weren't bred to be lapdogs like pugs or chins.

Chances are this corgi is a bit older. Probably 9 or 10. See, Corgis don't age like other breeds. They retain their youthful enthusiasm and excitement even as their muscles slow and their joints start to get stiff with age. A younger, more sprightly corgi would have no problem springing up onto that log and then hopping off, in spite of their stubby little legs."

I adore the breed, they're some of my favorite dogs to work with in a professional capacity...but without proper training they *can* be some of the most difficult dogs to handle.

Corgis too, but not in a way you might think."
geek,fcjjxe8,t1_fcjhqls,1577690573.0,"Was it? What was so fun about it? Most folks can't tell you, and there's a reason for that: it's forgettable at best. It was made for one specific purpose: to break box office records. Cameron has literally stated that his intent was to make the highest grossing movie of all time. And for awhile, it was. Because Cameron followed algorithms designed to make money, he didn't create a movie he truly believed in. Avatar wasn't Terminator. It wasn't Aliens. It wasn't The Abyss. It wasn't even True Lies. It was Ferngully, with Smurfs and guns, and lots of bright colors and a tried-and-true by-the-numbers plot. A fun ride? Sure. About as fun as herpes."
