She’s dealing with a lot right now. You don’t know the situation behind the photo - it could be she got dragged out by a friend in order to take her mind off of everything; not something planned on her part, but something enjoyed. 

It sounds like you’re still hurting from the things Alan said and did - and rightfully so! He’s an ass! But don’t take them out on Carrie. She doesn’t deserve this. 

My suggestion? Write the letter, pour out everything you need and want to say, all the vitriol you need to get out...and then delete the letter. Give Carrie time to heal. Illness takes a lot out of you! You’re obviously important to her, otherwise she would have just ghosted you with no explanations. 

If, after she decides to reestablish contact per her original request, you feel too hurt to continue your relationship with her, then that will be the time to tell her so - when both of you are in an emotional state where you can deal with the hard things that need to be said.
