AsianBeauty,ffkgbza,t1_ffkepvk,1580022300.0,It says on the label it's a make up remover and cleanser. It's not required at all if it doesn't fit your needs. =)
AsianBeauty,ffkd08h,t1_ffkabzs,1580020750.0,"Yup. I smear it directly on my face, which is convenient since I don't even need a cotton pad to get make up off. I usually have sunscreen on and a normal face wash just doesn't give me a good cleanse like this one.  

It has the consistency of oil when applied so I'm careful about tugging my skin. When it comes in contact with water, it liquifies then it rinses off easily. I still recommend a gentle cleanser afterwards in case you missed some spots."
Philippines,ffcxd3h,t1_ff8k2uu,1579809238.0,Pareho ata tayong nakita ng listing sa Lazada! Yung isang post pa scammer. 2005 yung nasa ad pero 2013 yung pinadala ng seller. =(
