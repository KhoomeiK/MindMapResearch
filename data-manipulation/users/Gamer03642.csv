todayilearned,ff8nhp5,t1_ff8c599,1579687420.0,"Active duty Marine for 12 years here, separating in June. I'm getting out with most of my B.S. degree already done (only reason it's not done is my own laziness), several industry certifications, and a hell of a resume.


It is more than possible to come out of the military set up for, maybe not outright success, at least a leg up."
AskReddit,ff84xs2,t1_ff7yl1x,1579666103.0,"I just think it's funny how both of y'all unironically used 'yeet' in a serious context.

gaming,ff4fdvo,t1_ff3xoyo,1579562291.0,"I'm on my first playthrough, playing Death March. I definitely got rolled at first, but now at level 16 with decent gear I can reliably take down any level single monster, and hold my own against groups of low-20s. Only things that have killed me recently are the Forbidden Knights I keep running into and a group of Eyrians or whatever those harpy beasts are called. Explored almost all of Velen and did every side quest below level 25 I could find and am about to start the Novigrad story (Pyres of Novigrad).

I'm having a blast with this game."

AskReddit,ff0oc8p,t1_ff01y36,1579470748.0,"I remember the most traumatized I've ever seen my brother-in-law is when he came down the stairs one day while I was hanging out with him during a visit home with his eyes wide open. Asked him what was wrong, he goes 'I just walked in on Bruce (his step-son, 10 or so at the time) playing with himself man. What the fuck?' I couldn't help myself and just burst out laughing."
