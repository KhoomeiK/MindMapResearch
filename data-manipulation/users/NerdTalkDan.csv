1) While studying did you do your best? 
      -If so that’s enough.

2) Looking back on the test, have you found areas of weakness in the subject that you know you need to improve upon?
     -if so, you’ve learned a valuable lesson and achieved what a test is supposed to do. Give you a fair and clear evaluation of your strengths and areas of improvement

3) Looking back on your study habits, is there anyway to make it more efficient, or effective? Can you use your time better?
     -if so, you’ve learned a valuable life lesson that will help you going forward beyond just the subject.

The more modular design does give you a safety net and is what I usually do for my job when I record. It also lets you mix and match a little easier, but putting all the pieces together can be more work. A straight read through is what I currently do with my content. When I make a mistake I keep recording and cut it out in editing. So it’s kind of a happy medium.

Since you’re running a camera as well, if you decide to do a straight run through you have to be careful of the cuts if you have demonstrative body language. Making sure your cuts aren’t jumpy will be important.

But otherwise go with what you’re comfortable with and find a system that maximizes your efficiency and quality of your content. That and your enjoyment are really the most important things!"

First, it’s all pretty small in terms of space actually being used, BUT there’s also an endless put at the center of it with what appears to be a power generator stolen from Naboo. How did no one notice THAT being dug up?

The actual lab space seems small considering how much time and effort went into building it, why didn’t they build more lab space more spacious living quarters or even a holding cell for test subjects?

The security room seems to be in the middle of an essential hallway instead of being in a sequestered room. All of these things are true of the original as well, but it stands out more with the more photorealistic environment"

Next, your voice is a bit low and your speech a bit slow. I have the speed issue as well as I’ve slowed down the way I speak over the years.

On a more specific point about your thumbnail. It’s oddly balanced. There’s too much sky above the characters which is just empty space.

America may have some of the best universities in the world, but statistically speaking, the total incoming freshmen of those combined universities is only a TINY fraction of the total amount of graduating high school students. So you can both simultaneously have the top universities in the world and an overwhelming amount of failing school systems in the same nation.

As to why American secondary education is VIEWED so poorly? There’s such a large gap in quality between schools in different states it’s hard to tell. But it seems to be a case of the extremes getting noticed. We tend to notice the best schools and notice the worst schools while the silent majority keeps chugging away."
SmallYTChannel,fevjaca,t3_eq6tmv,1579398092.0,"Hey bud. I’ll say the highlight of your video is the video editing and the background music. Those were very well chosen.

I think your narration is a little meandering and could be tightened up. If you’re just doing stream of consciousness at the time of recording it gets more of a pass, but if you’re going back and doing the audio then it should be tighter since you have the time to reflect and prep a general outline of what you want to say.

As I recommend to anyone filming here, be careful about filming Japanese without their permission. If you linger on any single person for a length of time you may want to consider blurring their face since Japan is a bit serious about privacy. Not saying to or to not do it, but it’s something to be aware of in the future.

I should have delved a little more into the flying issue as I did in a response to a post above. 

But my thinking is, Luke had the time and opportunity to fly. Rey would not have. She’s a pauper who is literally struggling each day to live. But she can find the time and resources to learn to fly a space craft?

Also Luke was very likely to have been shot down during the trench run. If his buddies and Han hadn’t covered him, he was going to die. Rey beat an experienced TIE pilot while flying a large craft through the inner superstructure of a star destroyer. I’m sorry man, she should be dead.

Yes, she flew poorly in the beginning, until she didn’t. She struggled to get off the ground, but then it’s clear sailing.

Thank you for watching and getting back to me though. I didn’t have many Star Wars fans in my life to run the script by and was pulling a lot from memory.

StarWars,fece3uz,t3_eo90zw,1578971734.0,The intro alone is great. How the two Jedi hyperspace jump into the chaos of the battle and how fate saved the glorious tale of this battle and this story for last. Gave me chills the first time I read it. It presented an epicness to the story that the movie kind of missed the mark in conveying.

television,feb3e9l,t1_fe9fqkd,1578955055.0,I didn’t find the reboot terrible either. I preferred the pilot movie style a bit more without all the crazy transformations. It also captured the atmosphere of a guy just trying to do his best with a car and a small ragtag team.
StarWarsCantina,feb17zz,t1_feay603,1578954436.0,"Thank you so much for watching and commenting. I think that’s very fair criticism on my arguments.

In regards to the flying, the issue isn’t JUST that she can fly, it’s that she can fly as well as she can.  Her first outing with the Falcon she struggles to get it off the ground, yes, but then is doing what amounts to a more difficult Death Star trench run  given how small the interior of the fallen Star Destroyer was compared to the trench.

I also mention that the Rebels gave Luke a chance to fly because they didn’t really have a choice. But we need to keep in mind that, will of the Force not taken into account, Luke would absolutely have been shot down during the Battle of Yavin. It was only thanks to his wing mates and the timely return of Han that he had a chance to fire on the exhaust port.

Also, it’s believable that Luke has flown before because he’s a farm boy with a lot of time on his hands. Rey is pretty busy most of the time trying to stay alive. So where did she find the time, resources, and ship to pilot?

I agree that Rey has a lot of external struggles, not flaws as external flaws implies problems with things like her appearance. 

What would you say are Rey’s internal flaws? What are the things from TFA that you’d argue need to be improved for her to have achieved character growth?

Just so you know all none of the above is in any way angry or hostile. I love this sub because we all are here to have fun discussing the world of Star Wars!"

HaloStory,fe8ix5l,t1_fdluemx,1578926659.0,"If I recall, it DID classify Ash a reclaimer, but once the counter response wasn’t given he was deemed a subspecies or aboriginal offshoot species of human (potentially due to evolution and interbreeding between species?). The monitor was going to capture for study where it would probably eventually determine that Ash was in fact human.

But the sentinels were just trying to first secure Onyx to ensure no flood undulate are the Shield World."
