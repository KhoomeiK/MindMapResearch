spaceengineers,ffge0lc,t3_etb7gh,1579904137.0,"v = sqrt (GM/r), this is the equation to calculate the orbital velocity of a satellite/planet/etc.

Reason: I had read this equation as a kid somewhere, and confirmed that it worked for the planets, Moon and ISS etc. But, for some reason it failed when it came to the orbital velocity of the Sun. The Sun was simply moving too fast. I thought I had stumbled upon something extremely important that all the other scientists had missed. I was so excited but none of my teachers seemed to care about it.

Eventually I realized this was due to the presence of Dark Matter, but the reason this equation is my favorite is because even before I knew about Dark Matter I would lie awake at nights thinking of possible explanations for this extra velocity the Sun had. They were mostly completely unscientific(aliens, wormholes, etc) but man it was some of the fondest memories I have, and precisely the reason I fell in love with Astronomy."
