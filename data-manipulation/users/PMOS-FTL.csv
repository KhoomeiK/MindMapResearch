AVX512 extension support is a [right royal mess](https://twitter.com/InstLatX64/status/1131489307473174528).

Link-time dispatch is relatively cheap among a few variants - but AVX512 has so many variants that you can't really do that in a sane manner.

As such AVX512 is alright if you're targeting one or a few specific CPU model(s) - but it's terrible for compilers if they want anything other than ""specific cpu model fastpath or generic no-avx-512-at-all slow path"".

Transient cause != transient effect, even at the hardware level (latchup, for instance) much less the software level.

For a ""simple"" example, something overwriting a const field of an object in memory is a transient issue that persists for the lifespan of the object. If the object in question is a hardware driver or something else that's long-lived... you're (potentially) going to have a bad time.

(For an example in this particular case... imagine for the sake of argument that your accelerator input is memmapped as some memory location in address space... and some event corrupts the pointer in your driver from ""pointer to accelerator input"" to ""pointer to some random byte that reads 255"".)

To be clear: is it *common* for logs to show the error as it really was? Absolutely, or else the logs aren't really worth anything.

Are they an absolute source of truth to the point that ""logs said X"" means X is guaranteed to have occurred? No.

One that USB 3 doesn't even accomplish that well, considering that USB 3 mainly has new form factors *anyway*. You can't plug a USB-C phone into a computer with a cable developed before USB 3. If I have a USB-3 B-type cable, I can't use it with a USB 2 device.

The intended backwards compatibility was limited to the point that it doesn't help in practice - and meanwhile it doesn't come for free.

Make USB 3 similar enough that it's possible to make a fairly simple converter between USB 2 and 3? Sure, a la DVI <-> HDMI adapters. But shooting yourself in the foot forever because of a perceived problem in the near term is, well, short-sighted."

>  well-defined monotonic and stable counter 

The idea is that you *never* add / remove leap seconds *from the underlying counter*. The underlying counter being, in this case, `seconds until/since 1.1.1970 00:00 UTC`.

> This means that unix time literally ""stands still"" for a second whenever we insert one

The idea here is that your counter is, literally, seconds until/since 1.1.1970 00:00 UTC. You don't touch it. It advances 1 second / second. Full stop. You ""add a leap second"" by adjusting the offset from the counter to local time by a second.

As such your underlying timestamp goes from e.g. `1577998803` to `1577998804` in one second. Meanwhile your local time might go from e.g. `Thu, 02 Jan 2020 21:00:00 GMT` to `Thu, 02 Jan 2020 21:00:00 GMT`.

Your underlying timestamp is still well-defined, monotonic, and stable.

This doesn't free you from all oddities - in particular anything that e.g. wants to go 'tomorrow at the same time as today' still has oddities - but it at least prevents problems with e.g. programs running backwards.

This does _not_ ignore leap seconds. It moves leap seconds from the time to the timezone, effectively.
