The white wire was connected to the positive terminal of the battery pack. Then there are three momentary push switches in series. The final one connected to the load and then back to the negative terminal of the power supply via a PTC.

However the green wire seems to connect the positive terminal of the load to the negative terminal. So isn't the load always shorted?

How does this work?

[Another photo with the power supply connected](https://i.imgur.com/mmAyFBH.jpg)

Multimeter shows that there is continuity across the motor terminals, even with all switches closed.

Ok, I don't get how this works, but the short circuit is definitely there and the circuit does not work without it...

When I connect the positive terminal of power supply to the positive terminal of the motors directly, so bypassing the short circuit, the PTC fuse gets very hot.

When I connect it to the same place as the orange wire, everything runs as expected. But there is a short across the motors (tested with multimeter.)"

They are liberal in name and practise. But in the way it means in most areas of the world other than the US:

> Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on liberty, consent of the governed and equality before the law. Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but they generally support limited government, individual rights (including civil rights and human rights), capitalism (free markets), democracy, secularism, gender equality, racial equality, internationalism, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.

Sometimes they can take 3 hours or so to settle, by which point they are hungry again and need to feed. But they are overtired so won't latch on.

So you are severely sleep deprived, but still need to do 3 loads of laundry a week because they keep shitting up their own back, make nutritious meals to keep your energy up, clean and tidy the house.
