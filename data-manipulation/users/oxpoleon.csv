aww,feygwhg,t1_fewztqj,1579445376.0,I was always under the impression that dogs didn't have the same awareness of the passage of time - they know when it's time for food but can't really tell whether their owner has been away for five minutes or five hours.
funny,feob1hj,t1_fenuoim,1579297623.0,"Where as I took my car into the shop a couple of months back for a minor job - mechanic said ""it's busy today so if you get it apart I'll have time to put it back together later"", handed me a bundle of wrenches and a manual, and left me to it. Funnily enough I go back, it's the best service anywhere."
Watches,feo9nqa,t1_fenm0cu,1579297042.0,"This is a newly manufactured Marlin. Honestly, as someone who owns an original, the Seagull movement is actually better than the original Timex one - it's actually possible to service, parts are plentiful, and it's fully jewelled. The original Timex movements are pin-lever with a single jewel on the balance, if I recall."

Rowing,featldw,t1_fe9z1oq,1578952107.0,"At least one of the authors is a rower, of that I'm sure. The long body of text is written by someone who understands from the perspective of a participant how the process of rowing works, but also how to articulate it from the perspective of an engineer.

I feel like this is a bored ex-college rower or three at Boeing going ""Hey, what if we put this X we just patented... *on a rowing oar*."""
NavyBlazer,feas0fe,t3_eo8n89,1578951722.0,"Label is in German, Juergen something, ""fine english country dress"" all in lowercase, not that searching for anything related to that combination returns a result. I suspect it's a brand from a German discounter or international department store.

 I would entirely believe the Made in England claim. To me, the construction, fit and finish say it's by the same factory that make most notably Rydale (house clothing brand of the Yorkshire Trading Company) and a few others. I don't know where the factory is other than somewhere vaguely in the North of England, but as far as I know they supply a number of other ""house brands"" of similar ilk. Such a jacket might cost around 30-50 pounds new. They're honest, working jackets for country folk, and they tend to stand up to reasonable wear and tear. 

The quality, if I am correct with origin, is not on par with Barbour, but it is not the stark difference the huge price chasm might suggest."

Very few people actually do outside of certain places like Devon, I can attest to that. Distinctly remember driving through one corner on which the words ""HONK HORN"" or something similar had been hand-painted on boards. It was a crazy corner, in that the apex was literally the side of a house. Perfect 90 degree bend, totally blind."
Showerthoughts,fdyuetu,t3_en7tvd,1578783673.0,I always map run/sprint to Alt. Shift is walk in games with 3 or more speeds (i.e. walk / jog / run / sprint). Caps is toggle walk/jog if that's supported.
NavyBlazer,fdyrswg,t3_emj48d,1578782898.0,"Who actually owns Savile Row Eyewear?

NavyBlazer,fdypx1j,t1_fds6sb8,1578782392.0,"Is it marcella, pleated, or just totally plain. If it's totally plain, with uncovered buttons, it is just that little bit more relaxed, and a cummerbund would look weird.

A proper dress shirt with a pleated/marcella front needs a cummerbund - often the front stops short of the shirt hem precisely for this purpose."
personalfinance,fdyj6rb,t1_fdyhxp8,1578780358.0,"Yeah, it's often the subtle details that get mixed up. I also had a really weird experience where I owned a car that was virtually identical to a car belonging to someone one street along, and we had plates that differed by a single character - where mine had an M theirs was an N.

For some reason we always used to get sent duplicate parking permits with the same plate number and name - both theirs, and I had to get mine reissued. Never did work out why - think someone in the council assumed it was the same car at a new address and just duplicated the record."
funny,fdyio88,t3_en77pg,1578780157.0,"I remember here in the UK years ago half the supermarkets did these amazing plastic crates. Yes, they were plastic but the quality was excellent, super durable and tough. You could put your shopping in and it was protected all the way home. Stackable and everything. A lot like the ones they now use for home delivery. 

Then, they just stopped selling them, and shortly afterwards got a bit funny about people using them - almost untrustworthy, like using this big opaque box that they had sold to you to put your shopping in meant you were a shoplifter. So people stopped using them. Think I still have one somewhere full of random tools or paint."

todayilearned,fdxqy1r,t1_fdxn0mf,1578772023.0,"I bought an Estwing hammer absolutely years ago when I left for university. It wasn't $100 (adjusted for inflation) but neither was it cheap. It's used, the handle is battered, but it's rust free, the claw isn't jammed together or ragged on the edges, and the head is devoid of dents or chips. It's been there through all my DIY and building projects, everything from picture hooks to furniture building to an impromptu demolition tool. In contrast, my father has bought a new ten buck hammer every couple years from when I was a kid to now, and that's well over ten hammers, maybe even over fifteen. It's cost him more, and besides that the reason he's bought each new hammer is the previous hammer has failed or worn out whilst he's using it. What I'm saying is over that time, I've spent less and been less inconvenienced by buying a nice hammer in the first place.

Basically it's the Sam Vimes Theory of Economic Injustice, except with hammers, and a $100 hammer isn't wholly unaffordable if you use hammers a lot."

And as you say, the contributions to art and culture in the 70s by black artists were significant, and black art and culture themselves became far more mainstream."

Guy I knew with one had his own lathes in a shed for, as far as I could tell, no real purpose other than to make replacement parts for several cars of this ilk - he ran a wedding car hire business in his free time. The Silver Spirit did not stick around long. That says a lot about how awful it was, given the guy was a mechanical genius with a shed of custom part fabrication equipment. It really sucked."

You can pick them up for stupidly cheap (basically scrap value) today, nobody seems to really want them - they lack the style and finesse of the earlier models, the mod-cons and luxury features of later models and just drink fuel and break down a lot. I had a buddy who owned one in the 2000s and it was honestly just the worst thing I've ever driven/ridden in."

Right here in /r/rowing you can find that /u/JLetten makes decent erg playlists though they're quite specific in their genre choices, not to everybody's taste. 

Radio is a cheap, easy and potentially interesting option, no setup or playlist making required plus you can stream basically any radio station from anywhere in the world for free on a smartphone these days. I personally am an old fogey who listens to BBC Radio 4."

AskReddit,fc69e2j,t1_fc684je,1577475296.0,"In the UK all cars have a *registered keeper* who is the person legally responsible for the car. It's usually but not always the car's usual driver. Insurance is also issued by driver on a vehicle, and one person must always be the *main driver*. 

You have a car with the ignition on and two drunk licenced drivers in the back. Somebody is committing an offence here, but it isn't necessarily of drink driving. 

If one of the people in the car is the registered keeper, or failing that the insured main driver, I would assume they would be held responsible. If neither of them are named on the insurance and the ignition is on then the offence being committed is either theft (by the two people in the car if they are in it without the owner's consent) or *quitting* (by the named driver, this being the technical term for the offence of having left the car running unattended)."
