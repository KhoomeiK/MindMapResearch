stevenuniverse,ffc9tyh,t1_ffbmh80,1579794811.0,"No he didn’t. He went from looking the same as he was since he was 8-14 to how he looks at 16. While he was technically 14 as in how many years he’s been alive, his body wasn’t like a 14 year olds"
stevenuniverse,ffc904a,t1_ffax3q1,1579794285.0,"Amethyst said she shapeshifted herself into a toilet for a month so a week isn’t impossible for other gems. Plus it’s possible that rose reformed to have a womb rather than shape shifting it, amethyst has created her form to have a digestive system so why couldn’t rose do the same?"
stevenuniverse,ffawnst,t1_ffatgkx,1579746219.0,"Was she even pregnant for 9 months? We have no idea what her pregnancy with Steven was like but it probably wasn’t like a normal human. She could’ve been pregnant for a week for all we know, she just decides to have him and wants to spend a bit of time creating the tapes and saying goodbye and then bam gives birth whenever she chooses to (or whatever way Steven came into existence lol)"
stevenuniverse,ffan2z1,t1_ffaexr8,1579739818.0,I feel like Steven/Pink Diamond can’t be the only gem to have emotion based powers. Ruby and Sapphire’s fire/ice powers both act up more when they’re angry or upset so it shouldn’t be impossible for Lapis to have the same thing
DID,ff7m7qs,t3_es2ywh,1579652895.0,Talk to her about it beforehand if you can. She’s probably just as nervous about talking to your therapist as you are about it
DID,ff7ao0p,t1_ff78bgf,1579644794.0,Ah I apologize for the unnerving part!!
stevenuniverse,ff7aire,t1_ff73gv2,1579644669.0,"Wanting to fight him, calling him pitiful, those aren’t nice. It may have helped Steven (at least in his mind that it “helped him learn something about himself”) but it’s not like she did it for him, she did it because she needs to take her anger out on somebody and needs to feel like she has a purpose now that the war is over. And at the end of that episode I feel like she probably feels like she has one again, helping him train. But that isn’t nice, that’s doing things for herself to feel better."
DID,ff738ek,t3_erxr9w,1579640230.0,"I’ve been diagnosed almost a year and I don’t remember and I’m not sure I ever will remember (an alter has told me she won’t let me remember because I can’t handle it, which tells me there is obviously something). I know a few things that happened to me but I don’t remember them exactly (such as a medical thing and my parents are emotionally detached from me and have been my whole life so I never had that support)

I think it’s important to remember also that what is traumatic to a young child’s brain and what is traumatic to an adult brain are two separate things. as adults we understand why some things happen so it affects us differently. These things may still be traumatic to someone older but maybe in a different way, or they may not affect us at all. 

So there may be things you do remember but since you’re now older you don’t see how it could be traumatic because you understand what and why something happened, though when you were a young child you don’t. Try to think of situations where“if I knew a young child this was happening to, would I expect them not to be traumatized by it?”

I don’t think you HAVE to know what happened to recover though. you can just not try and dig into it and can work on the symptoms you do experience and memories you do have."
AskDID,ff70ncv,t3_es07la,1579638755.0,"I got diagnosed and then realized that my experiences matched up with that more than anything else. The memory loss and time loss, the dissociation, the “mood swings” that I wouldn’t remember (which as far as I can tell is actually me switching with my child alter who has trouble controlling his feelings), the not recognizing myself when I’d look at pictures or in the mirror were all parts of DID that I never considered. I have never had “obvious” switches the way you see on tv so I didn’t really believe I could have it.
It took awhile for me to actually recognize my alters. I just worked on talking to them every day and finally got some replies and that kinda sealed it for me. Then I’ve also had 2 come to therapy and I couldn’t remember what happened so I kinda had to accept that they existed. 

Denial is a common thing for people with DID and so is what some professionals call “phobia of inner experience” which means if you aren’t looking for what’s going on inside, if you avoid paying attention, you won’t recognize it for what it is, whether that’s DID or something else (inner experience can refer to alters but can also mean not recognizing certain emotions or things you’re trying to avoid due to trauma)"
stevenuniverse,ff6z13m,t3_eruzh0,1579637812.0,"Steven gets corrupted and then Connie stabs him and then one of the gems bubble him and it just ends with his gem alone in the bubble room

Alternatively Steven unfuses with his gem half, his human half dies, and then his gem half shatters White Diamond (idea courtesy of listening to Interlude IV/Showtime too many times)"
stevenuniverse,ff6yk0p,t1_ff6vw1v,1579637533.0,I think it’s a mix of both. Steven’s gem half already had those destructive powers in cym (the breaking the ground when screaming she’s gone thing is the same as “pink had a scream that could shatter the walls”). Then spinel and the rejuvenator made those powers more accessible to whole Steven (as in like his human and gem self combined lol idk what to call that)
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ff66q5j,t3_ervdxt,1579620453.0,Do you think all the people in your lives (aside from the friend you were with) are copies of the people from world 1? Do they act any differently from when you were in 1?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ff66fbt,t1_ff661by,1579620255.0,Do you know who sent the letters?
stevenuniverse,ff4xn59,t1_ff4la6u,1579574910.0,Why so blue didn’t really show that there are those that are irredeemable considering “nice” Lapis showed up the Little Homeschool at the end. She could probably convince “mean” lapis to consider changing and learning too. Might take time but I think “nice” Lapis at least is able to change her way of thinking. Bluebird/eyeball/aquamarine I think have no chance of changing and I think they’re meant to be written that way to show Steven that not everyone wants to change (including himself??? Despite what he said in the movie he does not like things being different)
stevenuniverse,ff4x0ww,t1_ff4v51b,1579574483.0,The cluster
stevenuniverse,ff4wlzw,t1_ff45lpf,1579574198.0,Well Steven does see the Rose Quartz’s as his sisters buuuuut that also means Jasper would be his sister
