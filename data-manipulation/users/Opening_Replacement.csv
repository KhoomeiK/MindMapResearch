Rottweiler,ffwj1nd,t3_evk4ba,1580302635.0,I feel you. I’ve been getting these ridiculous bones from the butcher for my puppy Greta. She’s ridiculous. Your baby is so cute!
TrueOffMyChest,ffwixns,t1_ffw9ykm,1580302538.0,What? That’s not true.

Hereditary,ffvz0ru,t3_evfui6,1580277794.0,Oh man are you ever in trouble. Why would you do this? Do you not realize that King Paimon is REAL? I mean I’m into the Occult and was working with a group who’s intention was to invoke him ( he’s a goetic demon) and I just couldn’t do it. I left the group. I mean who purposely wants demons in their lives? Well You I guess. Why would you do this?
tifu,ffv4o6p,t3_euzj7m,1580255593.0,I was in Paris for the first time not knowing shit about how to interact with their kids and a little girl was staring at me at a cafe. So I smiled at her. Suddenly in horror she grabbed her mother and started going off to her mom about it! I was literally like wtf?!? I didn’t hang around to find out what happened next I was too scared.
