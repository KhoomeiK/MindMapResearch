EmergencyRoom,ffvhbkw,t3_evbmrq,1580264112.0,"You can call the hospital billing dept. first find out  if they have any help for ppl who don’t make a lot of money or don’t work-oftentimes they will reduce your bill for you. If there’s nothing then you can set up a payment plan with them. I’ve been in this situation and paid 20.00/month until it was gone. They may not like it but you’re paying it down. Either way, they’ll often work with you to help you out. Good luck!"

savannah,ffdnasn,t1_ffbvmt6,1579824521.0,Oh I know! And Salem during October is NOT where you want to be! (I’m assuming you meant Salem MA not SALEM NH?)  Storrow Drive-another fun road you can never get off of! Ridiculous. That’s why MA drivers are so fast-we know if we don’t speed when given the opportunity we’ll get stuck in another traffic jam!
