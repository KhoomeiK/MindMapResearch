iamatotalpieceofshit,fepxjta,t3_eq6gui,1579334099.0,"One of the first things they teach you in preschool is not to touch someone’s hair. Starts with pulling a little girl’s hair instead of saying you like her. Then when you’re meeting POC, instead of just asking them about their culture. The last lesson is when you touch a drag queen’s wig, because you don’t wanna admit you’d fuck them, and then they drop you for touching their 300$ unit."

rarepuppers,fdq7qvi,t1_fdoi58m,1578658410.0,"Most of the time when this is displayed by a dog it tells us that this sort of social (dog or human) norm is learned during very specific periods in the dog’s life. The socialization period (3 weeks to 12 weeks) and the fear impact period (8-11 weeks) are the ones where most inference learning is done. So if your baby’s paw is stepped on during this time, the steps he learns between pain and not pain is the same one’s he’ll expect to have to follow for the rest of his life."
