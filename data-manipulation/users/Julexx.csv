depression,fez8q2h,t1_fez7y4b,1579454882.0,"Unfortunately I don't have the freedom to do things such as taking less credits or summer courses (they don't really exist where I live), that's also why I am finding the university situation so difficult. And, on top of all of that, counseling is too expensive for me, I cannot afford it."

depression,fd5z7hp,t3_ejw74l,1578183363.0,"for years I was sure that I would have died at the age of 21. when my 21st birthday came, I was adamant that those were the last months of my life. when my 22nd birthday came around, I was almost sad that day, I didn't see it coming; the certainty of my death was appealing and comforting, after that I was just filled with uncertainty and doubt, I didn't know that to do with my life. Now I am just waiting for something to happen. Everything."
