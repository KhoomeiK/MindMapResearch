So if we were to live together at some point, finding a location between our two jobs would mean us both commuting 45min to an hour to work. Not awful but it’s very inconvenient. That’s a long way down the road and into the future so it’s not a huge concern yet."
dating_advice,ffic9g4,t3_etszi5,1579970436.0,Didn’t want to post in r/longdistance because of it only being a short distance.
dating_advice,ffi2rf2,t3_etrbsq,1579963385.0,There’s nothing wrong with it as long as it’s something you both want to do. You’ll get to converse more this way...Maybe if there’s a 3rd date try doing some type of activity though.
dating_advice,ffgmoeh,t3_etinhs,1579909797.0,Yes. Let him know you had a good time. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. It’s flattering...A lot of guys think they have to follow some unwritten rule of waiting a day or two to contact you. That’s prob the only reason he hasn’t txted yet.
dating_advice,ffglxbq,t3_etid83,1579909289.0,Take her out but don’t have any expectations. Just try and have a good time. You’ll get a feel over the course of the “date” if she’s into you or not. You really only had one conversation with her anyways so for your own sake you should probably take it slow and get to know her a little better first anyways.
loseit,ffgbg7o,t3_eth5cw,1579902554.0,Your weights going to fluctuate like that. My weight has swayed up to 5lbs either way from one day to the next before. Cut down to only weighing yourself once or twice a week. You’ll get a more realistic/steady number.
dating_advice,ffexvt4,t3_et9tua,1579869828.0,"How’d you get good at video games? Probably by playing them a lot. The same thing applies here. The more you do it the better you get. Practice, practice, practice..."
dating_advice,ffexl01,t3_et9ohw,1579869530.0,"It sounds like he’s really into you. He probably just hasn’t mustered up enough courage to make a move yet. Reading into his personality type more, introverted people tend to be more timid as well. It’s probably as simple as that.

You don’t have to follow the gender norms either. There’s nothing wrong with a girl doing the pursuing. If you sense he likes you then you’re allowed to make the first move too."
loseit,ffeu9t8,t3_et8rkz,1579865811.0,It can be infuriating to listen to people chime in on your journey over and over. Ive lost 90lbs so far but from a medical standpoint Id need to lose 50lbs more to be considered healthy. When I tell people that they’re in shock. I’ve had to straight up tell family members to stop asking or commenting. I think most of the time they mean well but it still comes off poorly. I’ve had people question whether I was starving myself or “taking something”. That hurts a little because it diminishes the hard work and struggles I’ve endured to get to this point.
dating_advice,ffdx48c,t1_ffdn7yy,1579831101.0,"You have to let them know you’re interested in some way though. If not you’ll just be left waiting around for a miracle. Most girls aren’t going to initiate anything unless you’re a perfect 10.

It’s tough if you’re not comfortable with being more forward but that’s your best option. It’s good to step out of your comfort zone and the more you do it the easier it gets. That’s the only way to get better at it too. Good luck!"
dating_advice,ffdl5lb,t3_et113t,1579823206.0,"If your plan is to get her to make the first move then you’re probably going to be in a stalemate for a loooong time. Especially since the norm is for the guy to do the pursuing. It might put you out of your comfort zone but your best bet is to start being more forward and going for it.

If you’re set on having her go first then you’re going to have to learn how to be flirty. Tease her about little things, make her laugh, light physical touch, maintain eye contact, etc."
dating_advice,ffccxpx,t1_ffc8l2i,1579796756.0,It’s not ghosting because she did reach out and apologize but it is really shitty. They made plans and were literally txting the same night about it. Then to just stop responding when you’re in the middle of ironing out the details? That’s not normal haha. If she actually just forgot to text back while in the middle of making plans then I’d be worried about her.
dating_advice,ffawvef,t3_esmhhz,1579746359.0,As long as you don’t go overboard you won’t have to worry about looking desperate. Being in contact before the date with let them know you’re excited for it. Just keep the conversation light and don’t get too long winded. You don’t want to put all your cards on the table and then not have anything to talk about on the actual date.
dating_advice,ffa48xo,t3_esgnlf,1579727573.0,"Give her a hug when you first see her next time. A hug a pretty innocent so she’s not going to be caught off guard by it. It’s a good first step to initiate some form of physical touch. Try to pick up any signals she’s giving throughout the date. Is she touchy at all? Keeping eye contact? Flirty? That kind of stuff. Lastly, before you part ways at the end of the date, stop and talk to her for a minute. Give her a hug and then just look into her eyes for a moment. If she’s keeping eye contact and lingering around then she’s waiting for you to make a move. This probably sounds corny but you’ll know when the moments right."
dating_advice,ff8v1b8,t3_esb91k,1579697049.0,I’m a little intimidated just from reading that tbh. The majority of men either don’t want that type of personality or are probably too afraid to engage. That’s a knock on men rather than you though. You seem like a real catch so you should maintain your standards but only within reason. Maybe start looking at guys outside of your current criteria.
dating_advice,ff7z476,t3_ervdxb,1579661821.0,That’s something that can be improved on. If you like everything else about him then you shouldn’t let one experience ruin it

dating_advice,ff5q074,t1_ff5lyn6,1579605463.0,"You’re looking into it too much. You met her on a dating app so it’s safe to assume she’s looking to be more than friends. Either way, suggest a day to meet her and find out in person. That’s the best way to tell."
dating_advice,ff5kets,t3_errsgl,1579597109.0,She’s waiting for you to make actual plans. From what I understand she’s agreed both times you suggested going out. Now you have to set a time and place or at least ask when she’s available.
dating_advice,ff32vni,t3_erdbf7,1579532259.0,"You really should start using at least 1 full body picture. I think that would be easier than telling someone that you’re bigger. That makes you come off as insecure.

Either way, the person you’re meeting should accurately know what you look like. You wouldn’t want to meet a guy who you thought was fit and then showed up 400lbs."
dating_advice,few7eu6,t3_eqr5m6,1579406404.0,You should try to meet somewhere in the middle for the first date. You can decide if the drives worth it after you see if you hit it off with her.
dating_advice,ferpeev,t3_eqg1q2,1579356841.0,It’s obvious that she likes you. She’s still talking to you so that means you passed the initial test. I think your next move needs to be to hangout or go on a date with JUST you and her. No friends this time...You need to stop calling yourself a fraud and show some confidence though. You already accomplished the hardest part of meeting her. Now you know she’s into you so you shouldn’t have to worry so hard about impressing her. Just keep being yourself. That’s why she wanted to meet you in the first place.  Good luck!
dating_advice,feoo7rz,t1_feoh4to,1579302906.0,Give her an option then. Ask if she’d either be down to hangout or go out one night.
dating_advice,feni0rp,t1_fen165g,1579285121.0,What you’re describing isn’t even close to what the guy did. You’re trying to make him out to be a sexual predator. He wrote a note telling her she was unique and would like to get to know her. Was it bad judgement? Yeah. A little weird? Sure...It sounds like his intentions were good though. He just didn’t necessarily have a good plan to carry them out.
dating_advice,femyczi,t3_eq15md,1579272769.0,"It seemed like a pretty sweet gesture that I think a lot of girls might appreciate whether interested or not. Some people are just assholes though. It just sucks you had to find out she was like this. Even if she thought it was silly there’s no reason to ever humiliate someone.

In the future, especially with coworkers, you should try talking to the person and getting to know them before putting yourself out there. It’s different if it’s a random person but if it’s someone you see all the time it could be awkward or end like this did."
dating_advice,femriji,t3_eq09k3,1579267529.0,I think you dodged a bullet. This guy sounds like an asshole.
dating_advice,femijyc,t3_epyar4,1579257382.0,"Personally, as a man, I would be flattered. Men don’t usually get the same sort of attention as a woman in terms of random encounters like this...Shoot your shot. He might be flattered or he might be creeped out and not respond. As long as it doesn’t effect your ability to do doordash then you have nothing to lose."
dating_advice,fel6eni,t3_eppfta,1579215045.0,"Personally, I think it might be a good idea to at least put it out there in some fashion. You definitely don’t have to dive into great detail. It would be nice to say that the person shouldn’t care but we all know that’s not realistic. Especially if it’s a complete surprise to them. However, you shouldn’t feel obligated to tell someone unless you’re truly comfortable with it. You don’t expect other people to list their imperfections with you, right?"
dating_advice,fek63b2,t3_eplf9s,1579193383.0,That’s the exact perfect time to ask her out. You did great! Now stop overthinking things and have fun.
dating_advice,fejj7ec,t3_epi7ia,1579176551.0,"I’ve been in your shoes and understand that you want some closure because you feel disrespected. However, berating him really doesn’t get you anywhere. You’ll feel better for a few minutes and that’s it.

If you feel like you absolutely have to say something though, keep it really short and to the point. Don’t elaborate or make yourself look emotional. If and when you send that message though make sure it’s the last one."
dating_advice,fejgzbo,t3_ephezt,1579173796.0,If I plan a second date with someone then I give them my entire focus. With the first date/talking phase things are still up in air. Once that concludes you have an idea of who the person is and if you’re generally interested in pursuing it further. I don’t know how people manage to be seeing multiple people at once. It feels disingenuous towards them and I wouldn’t want someone doing that to me.
dating_advice,fehx0re,t3_ep8e9b,1579125550.0,"I don’t want to trash you too bad like these other people but wtf! This guy obviously liked you and put in a lot of effort to show that. So you thought the correct thing to do was to ignore him? Responding to text’s DOES NOT make you look needy. It’s just common courtesy. Plus, if a guy was going to all that trouble to make your dates special then he wouldn’t have cared if you appeared that way.

You definitely played your cards wrong. You can’t expect people to play those games and then wait around for you."
dating_advice,feh12zv,t3_ep4801,1579106925.0,"Don’t be afraid to lead the dance. Some guys need more cue’s than others. Even if it’s just little things like more touching, eye contact, or being flirtier in general. This will hopefully give him assurance that it’s his turn to act.

Careful judging this based off of your past experiences where you said guys were more forward. Especially since you seem keen on him. He’s probably just shy."
dating_advice,fegi8o7,t1_feggru1,1579093593.0,It was always just that we weren’t compatible. I don’t believe that I ever exhibited any bad or unusual behaviors. Everyone of these past relationships was ended mutually.
dating_advice,fegi1a1,t1_feggj3w,1579093407.0,Just lack of compatibility or it was just meant to be casual. Everything that was broken off was always mutual.
socialanxiety,fegbsrl,t3_ep0hkq,1579086716.0,"Oh wow. This is like a perfect description of me. I long for social interaction more than anything but almost refuse to let myself interact with others because I’m so self conscience. Just the thought of engaging with new people or being in an uncomfortable situation often leaves me in a panic. When I’m with close friends or certain family members though I’m able to feel “normal” and be care free, funny, and boisterous.

I never even thought of it as being extroverted with social anxiety though but it makes total sense."
socialanxiety,fedue58,t3_eon6hg,1579020098.0,"Try not to let it bother you. Some people are just assholes. Especially teenage boys.

If someone won’t even give you the time of day then they’re not important enough for you to worry about. Keep trying to talk to people though. It’ll pay off eventually."
omad,fedm8iv,t3_eolyxh,1579014973.0,"I’ve been doing exactly that for about 6 months and I’ve lost 85lbs. OMAD on weekdays and 2 meals on weekends. I don’t even necessarily focus on eating healthy aside from cutting out sugar & soda. I have an active job and lifestyle but don’t go to the gym.

Like someone else said, 16:8 works on its own so only doing OMAD for 5 days rather than 7 isn’t going to noticeably slow you down."
socialanxiety,fedc1kr,t3_eokb3w,1579007160.0,"First off, don’t worry about whether it’s weird or not. Everybody goes through life on a different schedule. Don’t feel obligated to try and match what you see others doing.

My best advice would be to try and find people you have something in common with. It’s much easier to open up and converse with someone whenever you enjoy the subject being discussed. Aside from that, just simply put yourself out there. It’s a scary thing to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are worth whatever stress or embarrassment you might meet. Maybe start with dating apps so the conversation is a little less personal feeling. That’s a good way to get started and work on your conversation skills"
dating_advice,fed2pva,t3_eoi962,1578995804.0,"This sounds like me except you’re ahead of my schedule. I’ve always had a bad view of myself so I never even tried to date. However, this past year I’ve gotten in good shape and started using dating apps. It’s been successful for me. I’ve gotten a few dates with a few turning our really good. Dating apps were a good way for me to get my feet wet and gain some confidence in talking to girls. Obviously if you’re comfortable going up to girls in person then I’d suggest doing that. If not then try out tinder, bumble, etc. It’s a good way to get your feet wet."
dating_advice,fed263s,t3_eoj1uz,1578994975.0,If they both like each other then you should let things play out between them. It’s never worth losing a best friend (or two in this case) over something like this. It’s going to be difficult to sit back but just remember that they’re your friends. If being together makes them happy then you have to take a back seat and wait. You might still get an opportunity in the future.
socialanxiety,fed06u4,t3_eohid9,1578992115.0,"Try and think of a time when you heard someone else mess up or get their words twisted. It’s probably hard to, right?

progresspics,febh10s,t3_eobppt,1578958685.0,Post away and keep showing off! You should be very proud of what you’ve accomplished.
socialanxiety,fe6742b,t3_enw4nz,1578883278.0,All the time! Even when I’m just thinking about an upcoming thing that I’m nervous about my face blushes and gets really hot.
omad,fe0kh5a,t3_enki1o,1578814982.0,"Yes. The first couple weeks/months will be like that. I started at around 320 and lost 20+ pounds the first month and was kind of worried also haha. It will slow down though.

Good luck!"
omad,fdjlobk,t3_elnw1o,1578476848.0,I think it just clicks with some people. When I started doing OMAD 6 months ago I remember thinking the same thing. I remember saying to myself “This should be harder.” Any diet I tried in the past that forced me to eat bland food or have strict portion control failed miserably. OMAD let me still give into some of my bad food cravings and I think it made it that much easier. Plus I saw results almost immediately so it helped to motivate me to stick with it.

Realistic pictures. Not a lot of filters.
Simple, straightforward bio. Not too long.

At least 1 picture showing their full body.

Bad things:

They have “just ask” in their bio.
Bio only has their Snapchat & Insta handle.
The same movie quotes everyone uses.
Pictures are too presumptuous."
loseit,fdflz9z,t3_el3ibn,1578364788.0,Incredible! Really inspiring how you pulled yourself out of that dark of a place. This is the kind of stuff that really motivates others. Thanks for sharing!

loseit,fddt2ow,t3_ekv5fr,1578323267.0,Everyone’s body is different but I’d be willing to bet you would have very minimal loose skin. You might be able to tell by feeling it but to the eye I’m sure it would look normal.
intermittentfasting,fddn6cu,t3_ekuat5,1578318409.0,Congrats man! That’s amazing progress for 3 months. Good luck!
socialanxiety,fdde18m,t1_fdddezu,1578307895.0,"Exactly! I got to a point where I was labeled as the guy who just didn’t socialize. When that happened I just accepted it as who I was. That’s not the case though. I strive to be with friends, have fun, and live life more than anything in the world. I just refused to let myself.

Thanks for the encouraging words. Best of luck to you!"
socialanxiety,fddd1lp,t3_ekqnuc,1578306433.0,"My circle of friends has dwindled over the past few years because of me being unwilling to put myself out there. I’ve let my social anxiety get the best of me. I used to get invited to parties/activities every weekend and now it might be only a few times a year. It’s nobodies fault but my own and I plan on changing this. I’m going to force myself to start saying yes to things and make an effort to put myself in more difficult situations.

Some people’s social anxiety can’t be cured by their own will. I believe mine can though and I’m determined to overcome it this year!"
intermittentfasting,fd5vt4d,t3_ek3rzo,1578182119.0,"I (m/28) started at 317lbs and have lost 85lbs over the past 6 months by doing OMAD 5 days a week. On weekends I would eat 2 or 3 regularly portioned meals. I’ve also tried to cut out sugar and soda as much as I could. I never tracked but I’d estimate my OMAD meals are around 1500cal.  I have an active lifestyle but don’t go to the gym.

The 1st month I lost 20lbs and as you’d expect every month since it’s decreased. After 6 months I’m down to losing about 5-10lbs a month. That’s still a number I’m ecstatic about though. Ive also been lucky to have only really hit one short lived plateau so far.

I’d caution you comparing your results with others though. For instance, with my starting weight being so high it’s just a fact that I’m going to lose weight at a fast pace seeing how I cut my calorie consumption in half.

Best of luck!"
omad,fd3g77z,t3_ejz7bp,1578158027.0,Not sure I could give you any tips different than what you’ve probably already seen like drinking lots of water and staying busy. One thing to look forward to though is that after the first month it gets ALOT easier! It’ll become a routine and the cravings get much easier to control. Try and remember what the end result will be.
omad,fcywksf,t1_fcyuert,1578088660.0,Thanks for the advice! The idea of a free eating schedule is what scares me. I guess the works not done once you reach your goal...
omad,fcy46q7,t1_fcy0wzk,1578074460.0,I’m not sure how that’d be possible for me tbh. I don’t track but I’d estimate most of my meals are at or below 1500cal and when I’m finished I can’t fit another bite in. That’s still a huge deficit even after I get down to my 200lb goal weight. I have an active lifestyle so I figured I’d need almost double that to maintain.
socialanxiety,fcx7rgy,t1_fcw9sdu,1578054637.0,"I actually would but only if I thought about it. For instance, I was scared to death to give presentations in school because of my stutter so I would try to rehearse beforehand. I remember stuttering and having trouble getting through things with nobody even watching me.

I’d bet you can speak clearly when alone because there’s no spotlight on you. Nobody to put any pressure on you.

I definitely believe it’s solely a mental thing though. Like I said before, as long as I’m not focused on not stuttering I’m fine. If I’m with friends or doing something active I’m completely free from any stuttering."
intermittentfasting,fcw6nus,t3_ej8d9o,1578018376.0,I do OMAD during the week and then on weekends I usually do an 8hr window. It doesn’t seem to hinder my results at all.
progresspics,fctuz9l,t1_fctat8r,1577960903.0,For no particular reason my initial goal was to get down to 215. I’m thinking I’m going to assess where I’m at and keep trying to lose though.
socialanxiety,fctr7da,t3_eiup28,1577955301.0,"I’ve dealt with the same exact stutter my entire life. Like yours, it’s only at the beginning of a sentence when I’m very nervous. It can be humiliating because I’ll basically freeze and not be able to even get a sound out. Once I get past that fist word though it’s usually smooth sailing. It has gotten better for me over the years but still takes over whenever I’m in a stressful situation or think about it. I even worked with speech therapists throughout school and nothing really helped.

I can try to give you some advice that helps me but it’s probably different for everyone. For some reason I can say ‘umm’ without hesitation so if I feel like I’m getting stuck I’ll start a sentence with ‘umm’ to get rolling. Doesn’t always work though. I’ll kind of hold my tongue differently which I guess tricks my mind enough to get the word out. Lastly, I’ll try to just settled down and take a deep breath."
omad,fcsohnk,t3_eipiio,1577921109.0,How many calories have you been eating? It might be to big of an adjustment for your body. Maybe if the headaches continue you should start out with an 8 hr window to eat and work your way down to just one meal.
progresspics,fcsb77v,t1_fcs7pzi,1577914104.0,"I don’t go to the gym or anything but I have a pretty active lifestyle. I’m on my feet and moving all day at work, play in a hockey league once a week, and have some other hobbies that keep me moving. I do plan on incorporating some weightlifting though once I shed some more fat. I don’t think working out is a necessity though as long as your cutting calories.

I used to label myself as someone who didn’t have enough will power to lose weight. I tried every diet possible while struggling with my self image and nothing motivated me enough to stick to it. Then for no reason at all I started doing OMAD and I noticed the weight come flying off (especially at the start). For the 1st time in my life losing weight came relatively easy.

I’d recommend trying OMAD to anyone because it’s been amazing for me. However it’s definitely not for everyone. It’s a big lifestyle change when you’re used to stuffing you face whenever you feel like it. There’s many different ways to lose weight but I believe it’s more about finding the way that works best for you."
progresspics,fcs6ikj,t1_fcrred2,1577912124.0,I honestly don’t count anything so it’s hard to say. I’d guess that it’s usually around 1500 calories. I try to make sure they’re very protein heavy too. Then on the weekends I’ll eat a normal 2 or 3 meals. That probably sounds like a low calorie intake but I’ve honestly never felt more energized.
progresspics,fcs5y30,t1_fcrqmlg,1577911899.0,"It was difficult at first but after about a month or so it’s just become part of my regular routine. Drinking a lot of water when I feel like snacking also helps. I’m not super strict with it either in that I’ll have a tiny snack every now and then. I just try to keep it healthy.

No real restriction other trying to not have sugar and soda. I think that’s what’s made it stick. I can still eat the foods that I’ve always loved. Especially on weekends I’ll eat like I used to 80+ lbs ago. OMAD has a lot of benefits but for me it’s a way to restrict my calories without counting everything."

I play in a men’s league on weekends and it’s been the best thing for me. When I’m at one of my games I’m like a totally different person. I don’t have the slightest worry about anything and I feel like I’m actually myself. You’d never be able to tell that I struggle with social anxiety and sit alone in my room most of the other time.
