AnimalCrossing,ffaobh1,t1_ff928o9,1579740651.0,Of course! I thought I had recognized what you were talking about. Pretty sure I got it once as well. Wish there was a database for the nintendo-made ones. Lots of them were funny or creepy.
AnimalCrossing,ffao8sc,t1_ff8jijh,1579740600.0,Haha thanks. I thought I remembered a message in a bottle like what OP was talking about but I was a bit younger when I played wild world last time so I didnt know if it was a false memory. But I recognized that Daily Horoscope once I reread it. I wish there was a database that had all of the Nintendo-made ones that were sent out. A lot of them were hilarious or creepy lol.

Saying youre a vet on reddit is less credible than official veterinary and cat behavior websites. Between random person online and a credible source online... I think the other person made a safer decision."

unpopularopinion,ff87jh6,t3_erw3oh,1579668242.0,"I grew up looking up to my dad. I of course dearly love my mother, but I definitely had a stronger connection to him. He pushed me to make decisions, set goals for myself, and to not be so stinking hard on myself. I remember getting in trouble in 2nd grade and crying in the car while my dad talked to me about what happened. I feel like I remember the little moments with my dad way more. Him bringing home chocolate after work, taking me to bring your daughter to work day(as if that was a thing; I think he just made excuses to take me into the office with him! I was the only kid there!!!), and helping me with school papers.

As Ive grown up, I have grown closer to my mom. Even so, my dad is always there if I need him and I am always there for him too. My dad definitely built my foundation of growth and built upon my responsibility and determination. He was a very important part of my growth as a child. The lazy dad is an awful stereotype. My mother is/was anything but lazy; but they pulled their own weight."

Crazier things happen than a little girl giving a ring to your FH. If jealousy is an issue; assign it to them as jobs. I work with kids and they dont get jealous as long as they know what they are doing is something THEY must do and is super important.

unpopularopinion,fdfma1y,t1_fdfm498,1578364982.0,Yet you said it has no place in science?
unpopularopinion,fdflz3o,t1_fdflec9,1578364785.0,"Im not overthinking Im bringing up my opinion. It definitely has a spot in science. If we are unrealistic with our understanding of animals, we arent going to make progress with understanding species other than our own. They evolved for a specific purpose, but that doesnt mean anything in regards to intellegence per se. I could say a horseshoe crab is one of the most intelligent creature since it is successful due to its evolution over million of years. That is false. That is an assessment on success; not intelligence. Its mental capacity is that of a horseshoe crab, which isnt much else except evolutionary success. There is no substance, understandinf of the world, sense of self, or higher forms of thinking it has. Therefore, it is safe to say it is not smart, but successful."
unpopularopinion,fdfknm8,t1_fdfkbd2,1578363919.0,"Theres no point when Im being met with ""Ive said that already"" and zero response to points being made. If you were more clear with the reasons you have and where lines would be drawn with classifying animal intelligence, there may be a point where we meet. But Im saying as of now its a no. Just calling an animal stupid isnt wrong or a sign of an issue of superiority. Its a human bias, which is neither wrong or right. From a human perspective, it does make the animal more stupid than us if it doesnt perform to a certain extent in various things.

Thats why we are on r/unpopularopinion. For people scientifically driven, your opinion is definitely unpopular. For animal rights activists and animal ""equality"" activists, its definitely a popular opinion."
unpopularopinion,fdfk16d,t1_fdfjjtd,1578363515.0,"Just nevermind. Im talking about the human ego and a collective ""you"". Im just saying Id rather call it as it is and say X is more intelligent than Y, while understanding the merits of both. Therefore, we disagree."
unpopularopinion,fdfja45,t1_fdfio84,1578363012.0,"So then, yes I disagree. If you acknowledge a species intelligence comparative to your own, that is okay and can be beneficial in my opinion. I can see how they are smart in their regards, but I am not going to deny certain species are more advanced than others in different ways. When you take that as a bump to your ego, that is when it is unproductive and wrong."
unpopularopinion,fdficge,t1_fdfhvu1,1578362384.0,"Its an easy question, though! Is it people who have huge egos and superiority disorders you disagree with? Or is it the human classification of intelligence and the research that goes into it(even if it may contain biases)? Because just if you believe an ant or cat is dumb doesnt automatically mean you have a superiority disorder. It may just be a biased observation, which as humans it is natural."
unpopularopinion,fdfho81,t1_fdfgmer,1578361929.0,"That is not what you said at all. You said quite clearly it was both biased and pointless, so I am confused. Again, I dont see whether it is superiority disorder people you disagree with or classifications of intelligence that humans create. And that still isnt materialistic. It is still thinking of superiority you are talking about. Materialistic would be if I valued technology and items over life and other fundemental aspects. Superiority is if I said I am better than someone else because of X."
unpopularopinion,fdffokr,t1_fdff8ex,1578360605.0,"Materialistic is excessively concerned with material possessions; money-oriented... Maybe youre thinking self centered?

I dont see what your opinion now is. Is it comparing intelligence between species you hate? Or people that believe that they are superior? It is two very different things youre referencing.

Edit;; which maybe you mean a combo of the two. Which I could understand. I may view my cat as a lesser intelligence; but I still view him as a companion and dont think Im better than him since Im a human.

Naturally, it gives us an advantage, maybe. But it is vital for our understanding of other species and the world around us. Humans arent intelligent in their own rights regarding ego. Its a natural trait were cannot break apart from very easily. It doesnt make things unfair or pointless, it just makes us need to think past ourselves more."
unpopularopinion,fdfel43,t1_fdfdm3l,1578359866.0,"I dont see how its materialistic, but each their own. All Im saying is naturally, we are going to be biased while comparing intelligence or studying intelligence. Its human nature. To a cat, yeah I may be dumb since I cant catch a mouse or clean my butt with my tongue. And that is okay! As humans, whatever we study or think about will have a human bias. We think about and study things in relation to us. Its not unfair. Its just how it is. Being aware of this is a step in the right direction, but wont eliminate it. Its not pointless to compare animals to us, since it can and has helped with our knowledge of other species and their ancestries. Thats like saying studying illness and disease comparative to a baseline normal is unfair and pointless. It may have a bias, but its not unrealistic."
unpopularopinion,fdfcp9v,t1_fdfbqny,1578358594.0,"I dont think I missed your point at all. Its still not unfair to compare my intelligence to my cats or other animals. Saying that a cat has no need to speak because it doesnt have the biological means to is like saying humans have no need to fly. Yet we do have needs to fly and we can even if we arent biologically capable ourselves. Apes have no real use for sign language. Yet, similar to us, they are smart enough to use it. Holding a standard is reasonable when analyzing intelligence of various species."
unpopularopinion,fdfb4q3,t3_ekyu7r,1578357540.0,"Ehhh not sure how I feel on this one. In a way I agree, but I somewhat dont.

As an example, my cat is intelligent in my opinion. He recognizes me and is affectionate to me. He knows I provide shelter, food, water, and love. He is smart for this behaviour, even if it is a natural reaction to what I provide.

 However, compared to humans he is not very bright. This is where my opinion differs. It isnt unfair to judge other species intelligence based on your own at all. This is how we decide to communicate with other species using ""human"" ways of communication(i.e. sign language with apes). My cat wont understand me when I tell him about my day. I dont expect him to since hes not on my level of intelligence. Judging isnt unfair, its just how we operate.

Is my cat a savage beast? When it comes to playing with bugs yeah. Is he intelligent? For a cat, possibly. Compared to me, nope. Is he incapable of having feelings? No hes very capable. He feels stress, anxiety, warmth, love, and compassion even if its a different way than me."
cats,fdcub5z,t3_ekok11,1578284522.0,"When you do find a kitty, make sure you ask what food they are currently eating. Pick some up and if you prefer a different brand, do a slow change of food. Think about doing wet food, since cats need liquid in their diet. Even supplemental wet food is better than none. Also ask what type of litter the cat is using. Are they used to a natural litter, or is just Tidy Cats something they are fine with?

Scratchers of various types are important. Some cats are horizontal scratchers, some are vertical. Some enjoy both. Having a variety helps reduce possible damage to walls and furniture. Be prepared for kitty to claw items if you want a cat. Its all just material things, so you cant get too mad. It can be annoying, but it also can be redirected with scratchers.

Another thing to think about is flea treatment especially with spring coming. It is always a good idea to start looking at brands and investing. I have my cat wear a Seresto collar. In my area, most people use Frontline and Advantage. However, the fleas started to build a tolerance to those brands. Seresto is quite expensive but it works amazing and for a much longer time. No hassle of putting liquid on my squirmy cat either.

Also, definitely talk with vets as well. Getting a good vet is SO important. I made the mistake of going to the first, cheapest vet I could find. My cat had some health issues and they didnt take me or the issues seriously at all. Ended up going to a more expensive cat-only vet and were amazing. I wish I would have gone to them sooner.

Along with vet searching, read up on some cat health information. Know signs of a sick cat, since cats are really good at hiding anything. The more knowledge you can get, the better."

We are planning to have our favorite local restaurant cater, since it was a place we went almost every weekend and the owners know us by name; as well as bring our own snacks and alcohol.

weddingplanning,fcsf8dk,t3_eik4ms,1577915686.0,"My brother is currently in prison. My fiance and I have plans to marry before his release date. Its not to say we would prefer him to be in prison on our day at all, but we cannot stop our lives together for him.

Even if my brother was out, I would have some sincere worries about it. Not that he would ruin our day on purpose, but he has a mental illness that can switch and even with meds it takes a lot to have him go back to normal(this is the most polite way I can go about saying it). I deal with it too on a much lower level than he does.

But, my brother would understand if I was honest with him. After he left us we had 0 relationship. Now its back to us talking and joking around. I want him to meet my fiance, or by that time husband. I also want them to be cool with each other. If he was out? Id have to have a sincere talk about him being at my wedding. He wasnt there for any of my graduations or anything, and he burnt his bridge with me. We are only starting to rebuild and it is hard to forgive sometimes.

As for you, it seems like a very black and white choice. You invite them, and risk something awful happening. You dont, and risk a falling out with your sister. However, it may be good to explain your side and have a heart to heart talk with her. There is no gentle way of saying, ""I feel if he is there, there is a possibility of things going awry"". However, still extend the invite to her and her alone. Hold your ground, if thats what you feel is best. Best to be honest and not try to lie and say ""only married couples"" especially if they have been steady for a while. Be there for her. Try to be clear, but also listen to what she has to say.

Good luck and Im rooting for you!"
