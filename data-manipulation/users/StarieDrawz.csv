pettyrevenge,fes1uej,t3_eqbpy1,1579360589.0,"I have a very weird name, so most people either mispronounce it or spell it wrong. And it infuriates me, it’s not even hard to pronounce, but usually a correction fixes that. But then there are the people who dont. And that’s even more annoying. Somehow people have universally gotten better. Sometimes people call me a different name (it’s the name my name is based on) and then I correct and they apologize. But I can’t imagine someone repeatedly calling me the wrong name and then knowing it’s wrong"

unpopularopinion,febd47z,t3_eo1wvf,1578957610.0,"Agreed, unless it’s a movie made specifically for children that young. Over 90% of the time they don’t even understand what is happening on the screen. When I went to see the live action Lion King (didn’t really enjoy the movie btw I think it’s a disgrace to the original) there was a group of loud small children in the back just talking about not the movie. Admittedly there was also a group of loud adults so they weren’t the only ones. But then there was also a family right behind my mom and I and they brought a lantern with them. For INSIDE THE MOVIE THEATER and they where also loud. I would say that even up to the age of 5 for some movies :I"

Besides that I would say it’s really good. (Also OP, Incase my critiques sound harsh I’m not trying to. I love your style but in my opinion everyone can improve! Even the most skilled artist)"
