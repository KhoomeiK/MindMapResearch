The animals don't even stand a chance, being born in this system. Then people walk into a store and buy the conveniently packaged crap, most of them without ever having killed an animal for food before and preferring not to think about that aspect of their food too much. I'm not sure that this is something to be proud of."

I personally never had a lot of meat in my life or any kind of emotional relationship to it as I was vegetarian for most of it. For me, the things I loved as a child and which are processed a lot as opposed to plain milk/cheese/egg/meat - for example a candy bar - are ""disguised"" best and the most appealing.
There was a time when I thought and said ""I cOULd neVeR liVE wiTHouT chEesE"" and surprisingly a time has come where I don't crave it at all."

VeganDE,fc5xdv9,t3_egd329,1577467892.0,"Ich würde auch Skyr empfehlen und ansonsten generell auf eine proteinreiche Kost setzen, also viele Hülsenfrüchte und daraus gewonnene Produkte (Hummus, Tofu(zubereitungen)) sowie Seitan. Ein Müsli mit Sojamilch ist dann auch besser als eines mit Hafermilch. Und es gibt veganes Proteinpulver. Ich hab eines mit Hanfprotein. Aber das nehme ich eigentlich nur, wenn ich mal denke, dass ich in letzter Zeit nicht so viel Protein zu mir genommen hab. Also das als Tipps für die Proteinzufuhr. Natürlich kann man trotzdem gucken, dass man nicht allzu viel Fett zu sich nimmt und zum Beispiel Öl (was natürlich aber auch oft sehr gesund ist) nicht überschwänglich einsetzen. Ansonsten halt kalorienarme Getränke (Tee, Wasser, Saft eher gemischt mit Wasser/Sprudel), Gemüse, gelegentlich Obst und ausreichend Bewegung."
