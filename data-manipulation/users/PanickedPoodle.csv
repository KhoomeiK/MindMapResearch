worldnews,ffinf2d,t3_ettxtm,1579978061.0,"There are many factors to what makes a virus ""serious."" Mortality is important (and that's what this article is commenting on). But morbidity and infectiousness also play a role.

The initial assessment is that this virus has made the leap to (at least limited) human-to-human transmission. That's something SARS and MERS didn't do. The exponential increase in numbers and reports of overwhelmed health systems in Wuhan argues that this virus is a good spreader. Even with a mortality rate below 5%, that still has the potential for millions of deaths. It would certainly be the largest epidemic the world has seen since 1959.

The other important factor here is what it requires to keep people alive. Again, the reports are not reassuring. This virus has a characteristic seen only with a few other pathogens: it creates ""ground glass"" clusters in the lungs. Many patients have needed ventilation support to survive. A few have needed ECMO (bypass).

There are approximately 100,000 ventilators in the United States. I don't know what the number is in China, but it's likely to be roughly the same. Common antivirals have so far not shown efficacy. Doctors are turning to very expensive AIDS and RSV antivirals, which again may not work, and may not be available if they do work.

This is a serious situation. China is closing inter-provincial transport today. That may slow things, but it won't stop them."

With most viruses, that number is hard to determine because infected individuals can be very mildly I'll or even asymptomatic.

The best way to do this is with statistically significant canvassing of an exposed population. However, that requires:

- cooperation from the epicenter location's government (and we know how China can be)
- Typed genome of the virus - - something that was just completed last week
- A serological test, preferably a ""rapid"" test, that can pick up on a key molecule associated with the virus in blood samples. I believe that was completed 2 days ago.

The 2003 SARS virus was a very bad combo - could be spread from person to person and had a high death rate (something like 60% in older or compromised individuals). This one seems to have a lower rate on first glance and may be a bit better at spreading (called the R0, or ""R-naught""). That is bad, as a less virulent virus that's a better spreader will infect more people and therefore kill more people, even if the death rate is lower.

This is about impulse control. Some people just have that little voice in their head whispering *do it.* She may have been working out anger toward you as well in a crazy, passive aggressive way.
