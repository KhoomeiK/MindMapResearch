Vermiculture,ffdcqd5,t3_esqxuk,1579818113.0,Seems like everyone know about this but me. Thanks for sharing your wonderful idea!
Cooking,ffasfqp,t1_ff9ydcn,1579743419.0,This sounds like a good idea. Also you could try setting up the crockpot before you leave for work. I love walking in the door smelling a delicious stew(or whatever) that doesn’t even seem like I had to work for it.
MomForAMinute,ff8asnx,t3_es5qe3,1579671200.0,Wishing you both much joy as you begin the next chapter. What a fabulous adventure!
Antiques,ff6ujgp,t1_ff6sqsb,1579635166.0,My Dad collected these and I have washed many that he dug up from the Charleston area mud. I have never had the opportunity to see a pristine one come from the ocean.

MomForAMinute,ff3ev8q,t3_erdtvn,1579539643.0,"I’m very, very proud of you even if I may have lost the capacity to recognize the significance of what you have said. You are so special to me and I want to know about your life that’s why I keep asking you to repeat things. If my mind is slipping perhaps you can envision me as a young girl, capable of love but not understanding. We shine brighter together, I love you sweetheart."

whatsthisplant,fev5uxw,t3_eqoc06,1579393452.0,"I agree, in the indoor winter color(s)."
MomForAMinute,fev5hfb,t3_eqde5c,1579393345.0,"Outstanding, I’m so proud of you! Food and home are way up there on the adulting scale, you’re killing it."
pediatricOTs,fesn427,t3_eq81im,1579366992.0,"That’s a pretty good start as a contractor. Fifteen clients will typically average one 50 minute hour per week, occasionally two or less frequently every other week. You can get your feet wet and increase your caseload from there. Be prepared for cancellations, especially during the winter. If the child(or sibling) is sick you probably won’t get paid. 

In contrast, if you’re being paid a full time salary that’s a generous way to ease you in. Although as a new grad 15 tx plans a week will be plenty, I wouldn’t think it would last very long. Once you get settled I would expect to be scheduled 7-8 50 minute treatments per day with an expectation of at least one cancellation. From the beginning try to make your cancellations as productive as possible. It will save you from things building up at the end of the day.
