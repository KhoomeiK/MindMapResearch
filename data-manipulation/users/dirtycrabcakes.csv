Hoco,ffc5lro,t1_ff52u8c,1579792068.0,">And I do mean survive. School lunches are probably some of the least healthy things, and school systems get swindled by the companies that make this crap. If it wasn’t for the lobbying of major food companies to secure exclusive contracts with counties or schools we could have much higher quality food for much cheaper.

And they are only going to become less healthy:

ColumbiaMD,ffc1n30,t3_esojk8,1579789262.0,"Suburban police (not just HoCo) are largely worthless in terms of actually enforcing the law/protecting citizens, etc. They exist for three primary reasons:

1. Free AAA services. They will show up to an accident and write down insurance information and hand it to the other person (if it's convenient for them to get to you). They have special skills with pen and paper for that. They aren't qualified to assess fault in an accident, unless they are forced to do so. 
2. Crime deterrent. If I break the law, the police will catch me! (Lol... if they bother actually investigating a crime, then MAYBE... and then if they catch the person, then MAYBE they'll prosecute). 
3. Generating funding so they can have better cars, equipment. Traffic tickets are just about giving themselves nice toys and justifying a larger police force. 

""But wait until you need the police then you'll be singing a different tune!"" I'm in my 40's and I've needed the police on numerous occasions throughout my life - and they've failed each and every time, excluding the once or twice they provided AAA services."

Showerthoughts,ff6wx20,t1_ff68gxx,1579636569.0,"I don't know why you are being down-voted. I know someone who had something similar happen at Georgetown. Kid was pretty affluent, and Georgetown wanted him to come play soccer for them. Georgetown doesn't (or didn't at the time) offer scholarships for soccer. He ended up with some scholarship that was somehow needs-based (wink, wink). He very much had an ""I don't know all the details, but they made it all work out in the end"" kind of attitude."
S2000,ff6vbwu,t3_eru5v0,1579635633.0,"Reminds me of that time I went to Costco and bought an artificial Christmas tree in my s2k.

UMD,fev9jao,t1_fesuxhg,1579394758.0,">The reality of today's world is that you have to compete with and compare yourself to everyone else. Either exhaust yourself constantly with clubs/teams, perfect grades, and work experience or feel constantly behind and dissatisfied with your accomplishments.

Sorry, but I just don't believe this to be true. The sooner you realize that you don't have to live this way, the happier you will likely be."

They were after-market products and as others have said, cell phones killed the car phone concept.

todayilearned,felovi3,t1_felmrrp,1579227347.0,"I mean, I get that, but I would also say that my step parents in every single possible instance will come second to my biological parents. So, I would not hold my step parents to a higher standard than I hold myself. 

If you mom/dad is married to someone else, I see it as their responsibility to make sure that their child is getting equal care. I mean, if my mom is married to some dude, and his kid is opening tons of presents, and I'm not - that's on my mom. Or in the case of trust fund for a step child... in my family parental finances are shared, so if one child has a trust fund and the other doesn't, that's a weird one. Like, if I'm in HS and my mom remarries - would I expect anything from my step father? Hell no. But if I've been living with them since I was a baby - they maybe, yeah that's fucked up. It's all dependent on the situation."

I have a mother and a father. My step mother tried to cross a line, and tried to convince me to start calling her “mom.” That shit did not fly.

Everyone family is different. I found it extremely frustrating the more my step parents would try and break down those barriers and (in my opinion) cross a line. I have a mom - not 2, not 3 (mom is gay, haha)."

Of course, a lot of retirees in local retail because they are fucking broke and need the income desperately.
