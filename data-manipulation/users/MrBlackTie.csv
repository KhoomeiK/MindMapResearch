lucifer,fehvmxu,t3_ep33hn,1579124770.0,"In comic books, the problem with Hell is a bit explored. There aren’t several Hell but there are several hellish dimensions. And demons aren’t a really unified bunch. What it means is that in Hell, you have several species of demons and even individual demons who are far different from any other member of their specie. And Hell seems to influence other dimensions, turning them into versions of itself with their own species of demons (for instance, Trigon is a demon but he is not from Hell). Add to that that Hell and demonkind can absorb others, like for instance fallen gods becoming demons, and the fact that Hell is a psycho reactive dimension that can show itself differently to different beings. So you get a sort of patchwork dimension and ragtag bunch of beings. 

What it seems to hint at is that Heaven and Hell are a larger, hidden truth of the world. Mortals, even the strongest ones like Superman, can’t really understand it so they see a part of it, which isn’t the same from mortal to mortal (immortal beings, like the gods or the Parliaments, seems to have a better grasp over it). There is only one Hell and only one Lucifer but several species of demons and several dimensions that act as Hell satellital countries."
OnyxPathRPG,feg6ldo,t1_fedhq2a,1579079388.0,"My understanding was that people know that the Gods and Monsters are real. It’s just that it is very rare and that most of the supernatural things are hidden, out of the way or difficult to recognize. For instance, on page 26 of the book, they say that the Government and Big businesses know of Scions and keep a hands-off approach : they don’t want them meddling with mortal affairs (no Scion of Apollo running for Congress or running a major healthcare business) but are happy to let them go about their daily lives as long as they take care of the supernatural problems. Page 34 even adress how some laws are designed for the Scion and the fact that law enforcement can recruit Scions to arrest wayward Scions... Hard to do so if you do not know that Scions exist."

And frankly this has NOTHING to do with the nature of the government or the separation of powers. You don’t even have to let the federal government chose the date, you could just simply put in the law a system to determine the date. For instance « first Sunday in may on electoral years ». Or « on February 29th on leap years ». Or whatever.

Frankly, it seems like a bad excuse. Neither size nor diversity of population prevents the law from stating that elections have to be held on the same day. You just have to chose a month on the calendar and say « federal elections will be held on the first Sunday on that month on electoral years »."

Forgotten_Realms,fdbtezq,t1_fcwe6eq,1578261760.0,"If I may, I disagree on your point 4. Promotion for a Devil is decided by its superiors. So I believe it is doable, depending on the devil with whom you make the contract: it will just stipulate that after your death the devil will promote you. Such a clause would be hard to negotiate though: promoting a lesser devil costs a lot to a devil so it won’t do that unless the soul is of particular interest. I feel like only greater devil like pit fiends or arch devil would go to such lengths and only for someone of great interest, like an epic level character. And of course, there are restrictions on such clauses: no devil can promote you to a level of power equivalent or higher than himself and I believe only Asmodeus can promote to pit fiend level."

1) you can just add the experience part as paid add on. Problem solved. 

2) Your point seems to be that a mass system of free access to university is financially unsustainable. Did I understand right? Then I have two answers: 

A) it is not true. In France, universities are largely free and everyone has a right to go to college if they managed to get their high school diploma (which frankly isn’t really hard: 80% of people will get it). The system works relatively well. The main trouble with it is that there is a clear discrepancy between the best school, where the State allocate most ressources, and the rest, which give you degree that have little values on the job market. 
B) even if it were true you could easily solve this simply by managing the number of people getting access to free higher education. For instance, put an entry test in the public schools that are free. Or a review of the profile of applicants. Or a ton of other things like that."

They create items that only functions in the area of a mythallar, known as quasi magic items. Some magic also need a mythallar to be sustained (for instance, the mountain reversal one). 

The arcanists, however, were specialised mages with a broader focus. Basically, instead of the 9 schools of magic we know and love, they used 3 fields of magic : creation (which creates something out of thin air, like summoning an elemental or sending a fireball) , mentalism (which allows to control ore-existing things: a lot of the effects of enchantment, abjuration and divination belong here, but some belong to the last field) and variation (transform something into something else or changing its properties). So I imagine something like a bonus to one of the fields in exchange for a malus in another one? Plus some bonus to create magical items, with some kind of heavy situational penalty to use it ? And the ability to get some pretty unique high level spells?"

The problem I have with that, though, is that there is no specific reason for Ravenloft to consider that Cyre is part of the story of the Cannith House. It seems to imply, instead, that the one who was targeted by the Dark Powers is the Queen of Cyre.

Eberron,fcnr6li,t3_ei4ww4,1577816890.0,"In my case, as I have stated before, the day of Mourning happened because the Cyrans rushed a ritual to create a Mythal (a special type of epic level magic field used by the elves in the Forgotten Realms) in order to fend off the invasion by Karrnath. The Mythal was supposed to deny healing to ennemies while improving it for allies, allow mass teleportation of troops between cyran frontiers and would cast attacking spells at invading armies. They took the ritual from giant ruins but failed to realize that, since the age of Giants, dragons had put a cap on the amount of magical energy available on Eberron (a bit like Mystra did in the Forgotten Realms). There wasn’t enough magic available in Cyre to power a full Mythal, especially one as big and powerful as the one they tried to put together. The ritual failed in a BAD way, sucking the life force of people in its area of effect to try to stabilize itself. It even tried to drain a nearby Overlord and became corrupted by its power (Mythals are semi sentient, which allows them to distinguish friends from foe). Its failure to stabilize provoked all those strange effects, like the fact that geography changed (a side effect of its ability to mass teleport going haywire, with maybe mixed in some high level disorientation magical effect of the Mythal aimed at invading ennemies). It acts as a battery for the souls of the Cyran (which act as a source of power from it) and sometimes its « auto cast » function will activate but the soul of a dead (and quite mad) Cyrian will get mixed in the spell, provoking the creation of a living spell (think sparks flying off a damaged machine). 

It also explains some faint similarities between what happened to Cyre and what happened to Xen’Drik. Quite possibly part of the curse on Xen’Drik relies on the remnants of Mythals created by the Giants there. Fragments of destroyed Mythals are known to be powerful and to have unpredictable magical effects. 

It is keyed to the blood of Cyrian royalty though (they are the ones that can command it, from the royal throne in Metrol), which explains why it began to roll out from the royal palace in Metrol. 

Only way to fix it: pumping up the level of magic available to it. Only people who know how to do that: the dragons (and they are very very unwilling). Elves (who cheat around the limit thanks to drawing magic from Irian thanks to their manifest zones) , maybe some ancient giants surviving from the Age of Giants and similar high level characters. Means to do that: raising the cap made by the dragons (good luck with that), create a magical battery (a mythallar. Maybe the Giants know how to do that), create a gigantic manifest zone to another plane in the way the elves did or find a similar massive magic power source."

Eberron,fckqiu2,t1_fcbqctm,1577731016.0,"I would likely go that way plus some minor ailments that will be a pain in the long run. 

For instance, the ability to strengthen muscles relies on the fact you put stress on it: it then grows stronger as a response. So a continuous unnatural healing process added to that would quite likely end up giving you stat loss in constitution and strength. Stat loss that can’t be repaired through anything but time and only after you got rid of the healing spell since it is part of a natural process of your body. 

Another thing I would likely expect to see would be the growing of hairs and toenails (and so quite likely a charisma penalty on top). That and the strengthening of diseases and parasites. 

And the healing spell could actually keep you energized. You sleep less, good for you. But less sleeping, even when you don’t feel fatigued, can also mean a decrease in mental acuity, coordination and some mental illness developing. 

In other words I would give them benefits in the short term (some kind of regeneration, the ability to sleep less) and HUGE drawbacks a few days in (begin with drops in intelligence, agility and wisdom, then charisma and lastly strength and constitution). Likely three days in for the first three, two weeks in for charisma and a month or two in for strength and constitution. Those would only keep getting worse and worse (but I would cap the constitution and strength one). Plus I would give them a mental disease sometimes between the first and third phase and likely several physical ones sometimes later. 

So you would end up a feeble, hirsute, mad, diseased man. With constant regeneration. And who hardly sleeps."

business,fck6rw2,t1_fck4oj4,1577718176.0,"France quite possibly won’t develop a competitor to Valve. However the EU may and, as I said, it is à European rule that was applied in this ruling... 

As for the case, I read the original French article and the court ruling. So far my understanding is that Valve is actually selling licences to use the game but the ownership of the game stays with the companies. The Court ruled that it is just a way for Valve to disguise a sell as a service to avoid legal obligations and as such requalified it all as a selling. As such the Court considered that Valve could NOT keep rights on the things it sold after it sold them. As such it forbids Steam to prevent resaling the games. It is also quite likely, going by this logic, that it is for instance illegal for someone like Apple to forbid you from downloading music they sold you and take it to another plateform (or deleting it from your account if they lost the rights). 

Spotify would likely not be concerned by this because what Spotify sells you is actually an access to a service, a bit like YouTube premium: you do not pay to have access to the new Taylor Swift album or whatever. You pay to get access to Spotify and then everything on it is free. It does not count as a sale under that law.

I doubt Steam could easily circumvent this, it seems easier for them to allow a resale market than to change to a business model where you pay a monthly fee to get access to all their catalogue."
business,fcjz4v1,t1_fcjy3n9,1577711281.0,"I don’t quite understand this, to be frank. You seem to think the responsibility lies on the law that protects consumers instead of the companies that don’t respect it. The discussion we are having seems to be more about how the law prevents Valve from doing business instead of the trade-off between Valve added value and consumers rights, which is insane because it implies that laws preventing business should be shot on the spot for this sole reason. 

It’s like I’m looking at Uber all over again. Maybe when a company whole business model relies on reducing the rights of its workers or its consumers, it’s the company that is at fault, not the laws preventing it from doing so.

And by the way, tough luck because as far as the right to resale is concerned, the court did not apply French law. It made direct application of European law, meaning that the same ruling is likely to happen everywhere in the EU. They just applied a jurisprudence from the European Union Court of Justice from 2009 (in a German case) about « the extinction of rights ». Basically it means that when you sale a digital product, you lose any right on it (except for author’s right) and as such can’t prevent someone from selling it again. So you would have to exclude the whole EU from your market."
business,fcja5af,t1_fcitbtt,1577681103.0,"It’s actually way simpler than that. The French Government could just seize any belonging (physical or not) of Valve in its territory or in territories of States where its judgement have legal force (which is the case  in all of the EU, if memory serves) to pay the bill. It would likely be sold through a public auction, the process going towards the penalty. This is not a game a company like Valve can afford to play.

Basically, if Valve has to pay a fine for not abiding to the French law, the French State will begin by asking it for money. If it doesn’t come, it will try to seize Valve’s property up to the amount of the fine. If it doesn’t find it in France, it will then send to every other European Union State a request to seize the needed amount, either by taking it by force of law on the companies bank accounts or by forcing it to sell properties in a public auction. 

It’s only if Valve has NO property of any sort in the whole European Union that it can hope to hide behind the US system. Even then, it will likely become such a PR and political nightmare at that point that they will likely pay way before that.

Oh, and by the way: even IF it came to that and Valve retracts all its assets from European territory, it gets even funnier: any of its assets even transiting through European jurisdiction could get seized on the fly. Considering the sheer size of European banking sector and its importance in the world financial system, it would be a pain in the ass for them to avoid funneling any money through it for decades (such debts in France are outstanding for 40 years, if memory serves).  And since France and the EU have treaties with several other countries about such matters, where the same treatment would wait for Valve, good luck escaping forever. 

Playing american Gung Ho would NOT end well."
business,fci1qvd,t3_ehbprl,1577656700.0,That’s old news. Happened in September.
Eberron,fcg3i0e,t1_fcclcy9,1577636177.0,"Well, since you like it so much, here are few details on that head cannon : 

- Cyre rushed the job because of the Karnn attackers in the north, closing in on Metrol. 
- the Mythal was based on giant design taken from Xen’Drik 
- the Mythal was supposed to deny healing to attackers, allow teleportation of Cyran armies between its frontiers and be able to send attack spells to any enemy in the cyran frontiers. Let’s just say that an attacking army would have been in a LOT of trouble. 
- the Mythal failed because Eberron is just not magical enough anymore to sustain such a powerful spell. There just isn’t enough « juice » to power it. The Mythal, to sustain itself, tried to drain the inhabitants to get more power (hint: it wasn’t enough). The souls became trapped and got merged with the living spells (which, in my head canon, aren’t spells that were cast on the day of mourning, because there couldn’t have been that many spells in effect just at the moment the day of mourning happened, but spells « discharged » by the Mythal. Spells he knows because they belonged to his repertoire of spells to cast at attacking armies). It even tried to tap into the power of a powerful fiend (an Overlord?) trapped nearby to sustain itself, hence being corrupted. 
- The reason the Giants had this spell researched even though it can’t be cast is because it used to be possible. Sometimes between the fall of Xen’Drik and the end of the war between dragons and elves, the dragons made the same decision Mystra made in the Forgotten Realms: they capped the level of magic available to the inhabitants of Eberron. They basically put a tap on the source of magic and made it far lower than in the Forgotten Realms (which explains why high level magic is so rare). To « heal » the Mournland, you would have to open the tap (hence giving a plausible explanation for why your characters are amongst the only modern characters reaching high or even epic levels) or find a way to create a localized source of magic powerful enough to sustain the Mythal (a mythallar?) and so circumvent the dragon’s limitation. 
- creating such a localized source can be done because the dragon’s limitations only apply to Eberron, not the planes. You could go on another plane to build a magic source then bring it back to Cyre. That would royally piss off the dragons, though. It’s actually pretty close to how the elves sustain so many high level magic casters in Shae Mordai: thanks to the Irian magical zone it is in, they managed to tap into the power reserves of Irian and not Eberron. They could likely give advices to anyone trying to replicate the feat. 
- the Mythal is quite possibly semi sentient, as those things tend to be. If it is it is likely quite insane due to its situation. 
- the Mythal is keyed to the blood of queen Dannel. Unbeknownst to him, prince Oargev is quite likely immune to most of the deleterious effects of the mournland and if he manages to get to Royal Vermishard he could take control of the Mythal, which would allow him to free the souls of the Cyrans and give anyone he wants immunity to the Mournland effects (notably on healing). It would be wise to get Oargev to get control on it to purify it of the fiendish corruption before getting the dragons to give more magic to the world, otherwise you could have a powerful and malevolent problem in your hands.

Édit: note that in the Forgotten Realms, the elves did not run into this problem since they used High Magic and High Magic runs on an entirely different set of rules than normal magic. As such they could perform 9+ level spells even under Mystra’s restriction. Unfortunately for Cyre, Eberron lack the equivalent of elven high magic."
geopolitics,fcaugz5,t3_egtwuh,1577576847.0,"There are rules on succession of states, it’s not the first time it happened.

From a legal standpoint, it’s the institution of the United Kingdom that gets the seat, not its components. The institution can change its name or its membership, it will stay with it. So even if the UK loses all its members, it’s the member that acts legally as its successor (and as such upholds all its legal obligations and powers) that keeps it, which should logically be the last one in. I would bet it to be England."

books,fc714sf,t1_fc6x94k,1577494749.0,"You are wrong. You mentioned the law of 2018. Here is what the State wrote as justification for the article 2 (the one about those matters) : 

 « Elle amènera ainsi les juridictions à se questionner plus précisément sur la contrainte morale dont ces adolescents ont pu faire l’objet, sans pour autant systématiser toutefois la réponse qui devra être apportée puisque dans certaines hypothèses, l’adolescent aura pu exprimer un consentement éclairé.

[...] Parallèlement, l’infraction d’atteinte sexuelle sur mineur de quinze ans prévue par les articles 227-25 et 227-26 du code pénal sera maintenue afin de régir les situations dans lesquelles, malgré les précisions précédentes, le défaut de consentement du mineur de quinze ans n’aura pu être démontré. Lorsque l’acte commis par un majeur sur un mineur de quinze ans aura impliqué une pénétration sexuelle, la peine encourue sera aggravée à hauteur de dix ans d’emprisonnement afin de garantir une répression renforcée de ces faits d’une particulière gravité. Cette aggravation sera applicable aux faits commis après l’entrée en vigueur de la loi. »

It is quoted from the impact study of that law, page 33: https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/content/download/13519/143995/version/3/file/ei_jusd1805895L_cm_21.03.2018.pdf

Page 32, the State explains why they refused to put in the law that « every act of sexual penetration, commited on a minor of 15 by an adult when he knew or couldn’t ignore the age of the victim, without violence, force, threat or surprise » should be considered as rape. Basically, they thought that it wouldn’t pass the constitutional threshold, which is pretty high in criminal law. (I’m way too lazy to translate their argumentation). 

I also suggest you read the opinion on the text that the Conseil d’Etat (one of the French Supreme Court) published before it was modified: https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Droit-francais/Les-avis-du-Conseil-d-Etat-rendus-sur-les-projets-de-loi/2018/Projet-de-loi-renforcant-la-lutte-contre-les-violences-sexuelles-et-sexistes-commises-contre-les-mineurs-et-les-majeurs-21-03-2018 

As you can see in paragraph 16 to 29 and especially paragraph 20 to 29 the Conseil d’Etat opposed the idea of qualifying as rape every sexual penetration of minors  of 15. That’s why they pushed the Government (and succeeded in doing so since their proposition is what was presented to the National Assembly) to instead write more precisely the cases when the consent of a minor of 15 could be considered invalid because of his age. 

In other words, what the 2018 law did was making sure that the court took into consideration that the child was able to give an informed consent. It did not, and both the Conseil d’Etat and the Government explicitly say this, make every sexual act with a penetration a rape as long as the court thinks that the child was able to give consent. This is actually the whole point of the article 351: when someone is accused of rape on a minor of 15, if he contest the lack of consent (or as written in the law « if violence, force, threat or surprise has been contested during the trial ») the prosecutor HAS to put forward a « subsidiary question » to make sure that he is at least condemned for the misdemeanor. 

What I am getting at is that you are wrong in assuming this law qualifies every act of penetration of a minor of 15 a rape. What it did is make it more likely by forcing the judge of taking into account the mental capacity of the minor (an off of the way comment in the Government document make it seem like only the physical development of the child used to be  taken into account, as in did he show external signs of puberty). But still, there is no « age of consent » as in a definitive age at which you KNOW sex will be qualified as rape.

Your mistake seems to stem from an over interpretation of article 222-22-1: it doesn’t mean that every minor of 15 will be considered unable to give consent, it means that for minor of 15 inability to give consent could be, amongst other things, caused by the things listed.

Edit : added the last paragraph and this fair warning: do not trust a government when it tells you that a new law does something. Trust the text of the law.

books,fc6p7im,t1_fc6ie9i,1577485998.0,"I kindly disagree. If 15 was really an age of consent, anything under it would be considered rape since the child couldn’t consent to it. 

There is no « fixed » age of consent in the French pénal code. For instance, « corruption of minor » (227-22) does not forbid ALL sexual relationships between adults and minors. What it DOES forbid is to initiate a minor to a vice, in order to take advantage of it. But if the sexual act is not a vice in itself or the minor already knew/practiced it, it is not forbidden by this article. The vagueness in the definition actually leaves a lot of leeway. 

As for 227-25, it is indeed closer to an age of consent. I would argue that the fact that this is not the same thing in penal law as rape tend to show it is not, per se, an age of consent. If you compare the two, you realize that 227-25 is a relatively minor infraction (pun non intended) punished of up to 7 years in prison and a 100.000 euros fine. Rape on the other hand, when commited on someone under 15, is punished by up to 20 years in prison. Furthermore 227-25 is not covered under 222-44 and other similar articles. There is a clear gap in repression between the two. You should note, by the way, that 227-25 gives the same punition to exhibitionism in front of a child and sexual relationships: in both case it is not a crime but a lower ranking of offense. 

It does not mean that there isn’t such a thing as an age of consent. But the judges apply it case by case by taking into account the maturity of the child. It is often set up around 13 years old. 

Basically, what it means is that you have something looking like this: 

- under an undetermined age, often 13, a child can’t consent to a sexual relationship. ANY sexual act will be considered rape and send you to prison for a LONG time. 

- between 13 and 15, a child CAN consent but the adult shouldn’t. A sexual act will then not be considered rape but a misdemeanor. 

- between 15 and 18 there is a special protection against people having authority or being family members, thanks to 227-27. 

So there is an age of consent but it is up to the judge to decide it. It is clearly under 15 though. And between that age of consent and 15, the penal law is a bit murky on what is lawful and unlawful."

Secondly, your problem is with where the money is spent, not that it is spent at all. Again, not a counterpoint to my argument. 

Lastly, part of the reason the US can afford to do that is because it is such an important place for international trade that other countries will help it keep afloat.

Economics,fbzzi45,t1_fbzv41v,1577270330.0,"Government spending isn’t supposed to create ROI for the government itself, that’s the main point of taxation. It creates ROI for other actors that, in turn, pay taxes. 

Let’s take an example (it’s the way it was first explained to me): a coastal town has a fishing industry but no lighthouse. Every year, ships go down because of that. Family lose members and the cost for the community is high: lost capital and lost workers for the businesses, loss of income for families, emotional damages, ... 

Unfortunately a lighthouse costs a lot of money. Furthermore building the lighthouse would be a poor business decision: you would sink your capital (and the operating cost) in the project but your competitor would also benefit from it and you would have no way to recoup the cost from them. So the town builds the lighthouse and hire someone to take care of it. It then taxes every fishery for the cost of the project and the operating cost. In the end business make more money than it costs them thanks to that investment that none of them would have made and the community is all the better. 

Another case is when a business WOULD foot the bill but in doing so would get such an important advantage over its competitors that it would kill the market. For instance, let’s look at what in Europe we call « network industries ». Network industries are those industries which, to function properly, need the creation of a dedicated and costly network of infrastructures. Examples are Telecom, gas, electricity, ... 

Those network industries are quite often former public monopolies. Why? Because back when they were first put together, the cost of creating the network was so high no business owner would have done it. And if one would have done it he would have been in a situation of natural monopoly and could have easily taken measures to prevent the entry of new competitors on the market. Furthermore, it was better for everyone if the network wasn’t fractionned but instead was one giant network (for security of approvisionnement, for instance). That’s why the State in those instances should take the matter into its own hand and since a monopoly will naturally emerge, be that monopoly until it can pass the torch to a new generation of mature business who will bring competition to the field."
Economics,fbzyyb7,t1_fbzjtqg,1577269406.0,"It really depends. One of the most basic ideas in economy, something pretty much every school of thoughts agrees on, is counter cycling policies.

It goes like this: you have a crisis, you spend money (either by tax cuts or budgetary spending, it’s one of the disagreements between economists. That and where to spend the money) to help the markers survive the crisis. Once the crisis is gone, you apply austerity to put money away for the next crisis since the economy can survive without your help now. And at the next crisis you begin the cycle anew. 

The idea that you can’t, at all, have deficits is, frankly, dangerous. It means that in case of crisis you need to find other means of intervention. In that case, the main way to get the money to help your economy is by drawing it from international markets, which often means competition with your neighboring States to drain them of their capital."

news,fbxh5s6,t1_fbwtw5f,1577187234.0,"To be fair, this emphasis on tests and schools is highly dependent on several factors: 

- the bigger the structure, the more important it will be.  It’s in part because it is an easy way for HR to gauge a candidate and in part because of the power of the schools social networks. 
- some work are way more insistent on this than others. Particularly, three kind of jobs seem pretty keen on this imho: a) those that have a State-based pool of applicants (for instance, lawyers, who can come from the rank of the high ranking public servants I talked about in another post) , b) people graduating from business schools and c) engineers (outside of, for some reasons, computer science). 

As I said, there are several problems with that system in my opinion: 

- the entry tests are badly designed. The way they are often set up they do not measure the ability of the contestant to perform as a student of the school but his mastery of knowledge, a lot of which have little to do with the thing being taught in the school. This knowledge often end up being an insurmontable obstacle for students from poorer families. For instance, when applying for law school, I was asked about the importance of costumes in theatre (I never went to the theatre in my life) and the housing market in Paris (I had not set foot in Paris since I was 10). 

- the schools are not focused enough and do not teach enough practical skills. You end up with a lot of people that are brilliant but can do nothing and then have to be taught on the job. 

- Great Schools put a lot of pressure on the « esprit de corps » , basically a sense of belonging and camaraderie between students, even from different time periods. Even teachers feel as if they are « in » on this camaraderie. Unfortunately, it ends up with the same kind of excess you see in college fraternities in the movies about the US. And with the power of those schools, it ends up as a way to naturally trust positions of power. 

- the public system of universities is not preoccupied enough about the job prospects of its students. It is actually a recurring joke in France that some branches of universities have for sole mission to teach the next generation of people who will teach there. This create a clear inequality between students from the public system and the Great School system and an expectation that people from the public system weren’t actually taught anything serious (short of the very best public universities, like Sorbonne for instance) 

- the way people graduate from the Public Servjce schools needs to change : the « first of the promotion picks his job first » ends up giving us people good at anything but their job ( 19 in every subject but 12 on the subject of you job will still let you pick that job first) and people who are not motivated at all by their job, just by its prospect (the jobs picked first are often those that enable you to quickly go to the private sector for much more money)"
news,fbwbr6n,t1_fbw302k,1577145758.0,"No it is not. What you totally fail to grasp is how the two systems are set separately. The point of the pre-bac system is NOT to give anyone access to academic excellency. It is not what is taught and not what is measured. The point of that system is to give people tools to be a functioning adult. This is why there are very few possibilities to tweak that teaching according to your preferences. (They grow with age but don’t come close to what you will see in foreign countries) It does the job it was meant to do, even if a lot of people think it could be a bit harder: 75% of a generation seems a bit high and lots of people graduate without mastering the aforementioned tools. It could be lowered to 50%. To repeat: academic excellency is NOT the point of the pre-bac system. As such, it isn’t the point of the baccalaureat either. Your insistence on considering that second degree teaching is an indicator of the cultural importance of academics is, as such, based on a false premise: the idea that the two systems are linked in any way. In fact, the idea that people under 18 should be prepared for university and work-based teaching seems like a good way to put way too much pressure on them and create people with only specialized knowledge (which is one of the thing that Frenchmen find revolting in other countries educational system: the way they create « savant idiots »: people who are extremely good in their field but lack a lot of basic knowledge outside of it). Frankly, it seems overly competitive, a little bit insane and slightly dangerous for the efficiency of a democratic system. 

As for the post bac system, it pursues two separate objectives: one is to continue growing the citizens. It is some sort of survival of Enlightenment philosophy where people are supposed to continue studying as a mean of personal growth. The other (and frankly, main) part is to prepare student for their future jobs. In order to make sure students are able to do those jobs, tests are administered before they enter in the top schools (other schools take all people they can, because it is an obligation by law), then during the duration of their stay in the school and again at the end of the school. That is how those schools make sure that people are up to their academic standards. Your insistence on considering research as the way to measure the academic worth of those schools seems way more elitist to me than the French system and, frankly, flawed: research is important but a school is a school. What should be important in a school is how well it teaches people, which isn’t linked with how well research is done. This is why tests (before, during and at the end of the school) seem to me like a better way to measure it. And, obviously, the ultimate test: the job market. As such, the main problem with the Great Schools in France is not the way you enter them, it is the way you exit them. They put too much emphasis on academic knowledge and not enough on practical know-how for evaluation during the course of your studies and once you get discharged. (Another problem would be how they try to teach you too many things outside of your job: for instance, history or philosophy in a law class or epistemology in a business school...) 

Let’s take an example about that: I graduated from the second best school in the country in my specialty, a subset of French law. During my studies, my teachers taught me a list of laws to know by heart and principles that underly the way law is created in France. They also taught me philosophy, sociology, economy... once I graduated I could easily predict how a trial would end up being ruled (I am actually quite good at that, amongst my peers). However, what they failed to teach me was... any sort of practical skill. I did not know how to write a memoir for a trial nor how to search the databases for previous rulings. I did not know how the law was written (not the process, that I knew. I was talking about what we call legistic : pretty much to law what grammar and syntax are to language). I had to learn that on my own from scratch. 

It has nothing to do with how good my teachers research were (they were amongst the best of the country). It has nothing to do either with how I was taught before I was 18. It had everything to do with how French school put too much emphasis on theoretical knowledge and not enough on practical know-how. As such, the problem does not stem from the entry test (I have my troubles with those and the way they are currently made but not with their principle) but how we were evaluated during our studies and how those studies were shaped : too much time wasted on things I wouldn’t need in my work and not enough time spent on practical knowledge."
news,fbw0s9v,t1_fbvwh47,1577138880.0,"Again, what you don’t understand is that in France the baccalaureat is NOT considered a part of the academic process. It will never be: it is meant as a way of graduating from being a child. Basically it says « you are good enough to go out on your own. Pretty much ». This is because school before that is considered a public service to build up adult citizens. Subjects of studies are not chosen for their utility in life or work but to give you a well rounded knowledge in order to, basically, « free you from ignorance ». Trying to make the baccalaureat an academic test is akin to trying to asking for your city doctor to give you the same check ups as those to become an astronaut: they are only superficially similar. 

The true test of academics in the French system are those that are given AFTER the baccalaureat, once you are acknowledged as an adult. Those are hard and tailored to the profession you are preparing for. 

Your proposition sounds like trying to judge if someone could become an engineer based on his tests results in elementary school... 

As for the way they are judged, you forget one thing: once you are in a Great School, you are still tested. In fact, a lot of students don’t make it to the end of the school. 

You seem to judge academic excellence according to research paper published by the staff. But I strongly disagree: first, good researchers often make poor teachers. The quality and quantity of research papers should only matter for schools that prepare students to do research. Secondly, the emphasis on research seems hardly subjective and impractical: the way Frenchmen measure it is employment rates and salary of graduates. It is pretty down to earth and is actually a good way to measure the quality of the graduates. 

Lastly, teaching is a valued profession. In university, not below. You seem to have trouble grasping how much the world before the baccalaureat and after it are distinct in France: before the bac, teaching is a public service to help you become an adult and is done by low tier public servants. Those teachers are discredited socially, badly paid and understaffed. That’s why people are fleeing that profession. In the mind of a Frenchman, public teaching before the bac is somehow a mix of playground for children and a charity to the less fortunate families to give them a chance to compete for a better school after the bac. University teachers, on the other hand, are well paid (though not as much as in the US and other countries like that whose university system is, frankly, maddening to a Frenchman with how much they cost and how they profit on the students), enjoy social status and a constitutionnal protection. The things that they teach are actually valued because Frenchmen consider that , unlike for teachings before the bac, they actually serve a purpose. 

Those are two distinct system. Your insistence on judging people according to their grades in high school is mind boggling. High school serves no purpose in academic excellency. It is just part of the system to get you to adult life. Only universities and schools are able to judge your ability to get into your field of expertise because that’s what they were designed to do."
