depression,feyi8rn,t3_eqs4h8,1579445886.0,"I go through phases of times where I’ll feel like there’s nothing wrong like, at all. Like I’ll feel like I have nothing wrong with me, despite having cut three days ago and wanting to every day, I still feel.. normal. And then it goes back down but while I feel normal I feel like nothing from the past 6 months has been real and I’ve been faking it and because of that I don’t want to get better because I want to prove to myself I didn’t make everything up. Is anyone like this?"

I feel so weird Bc if I look away, I feel like nothing happened and I’m normal, Bc I’m so used to hiding my feelings and pretending, my own head believes I’m just fine and so now I’m constantly thinking I’m crazy for pretending to feel this way when it’s obviously real I just... plz tell me someone gets this?"
