northernlion,ffhvna2,t3_etgxbt,1579955999.0,"r/c25k, also the app I used is the Zen Labs one - no clue if it’s anything special as it did everything I needed.

For context, I was overweight and hadn’t ran in years when I started it. I did it sporadically and just didn’t commit for awhile, but when I did it worked.

I moved past it awhile ago, but as of a month ago I was able to run 40 miles a week with some 16 milers. I’m not qualifying for Boston anytime soon, but for someone who has struggled against a sedentary lifestyle for years running has been a huge boon.

Good luck, I wish you the best!

Edit: And just some general tips, run slow. I mean it, run slow. Let me clarify, you may be going so slow you feel like you could walk faster - that’s great, go SLOWER. Building up running fitness is all about mileage, slow miles are miles you didn’t injure yourself as a beginner. When you’re new your pace isn’t something that should even concern you, your goal is to improve the time you can spend on your feet. New runners are notoriously prone to pushing themselves too fast, too hard, and too long. It’s not a sport where you should run yourself down. Again I wish you the best!"

pathofexile,ff8oxbi,t1_ff8o6oa,1579689587.0,"I’m all for your plea to think critically about why we feel the way that we do.

I’ll just chime in that as a new player, this being my first league, I fucking love metamorph.

It’s straight forward, rewarding, gives me guidance around a map, and completely optional.

I find some of the past league mechanics to be incredibly unintuitive or clunky, and even just skip some.

Even if they nerfed the rewards greatly I still enjoy how metamorph affects my movement and flow through a map - it gives me a nice carrot to chase. Whereas I find that actual map bosses tend to be a letdown with no real buildup, metamorphs feel like a great capping off point to a map.

My idea, and I’ve nowhere near the knowledge base to know if this is good or not, is to keep metamorph and use it as the de facto “league merge” mechanic. What I mean by this is nerf the reward next season, but keep it as the way to get small amounts of separate league reward like it is currently. Its strength should be its variety.

Maybe don’t have the current newest league included until the next league, I don’t know. These are all details someone more in tune with the game would have to decide, but as it stands I think metamorph just adds a good gameplay loop that doesn’t hurt anything else in the game."

pathofexile,ff863al,t1_ff85z14,1579667025.0,"I agree that the new armor does look substantially better, especially the ivory tower.
That’s why I’m reserving being too harsh until I see how PoE 2 handles it - the footage I’ve seen looks fantastic.

The uniques looking cool is marred by the fact that skin changes cost money too. Like what the damn it! 

It just feels like while the game is free to play it withholds A LOT of things that I’d usually get with a 60 dollar purchase anyway.

So it’s free to play, yeah, but to get pretty standard features I’m nickel and dimed.

That being said I’m guilty of buying stuff from the store, so my conviction isn’t necessarily changing matters.

I mean I could buy Grim Dawn and all of its expansion for one MTX armor set from this game. I’m not saying Grim Dawn is as good as this, but it’s still incredible. The price differential is just insane. Yeah it’s free, but if I want as many armor looks as I get from 45 dollars worth of Grim Dawn (and lets be real, on sale I can snag it for half that) I’d spend thousands of dollars on this game, or at least hundreds on skin transfers.

I want to support the developers, but I genuinely believe that their current system could be much, much improved.

Also just to clarify, I’m not shitting on the game, and I understand why this store came about in the first place. They were a small, scrappy team who was just struggling to keep the lights on. I just don’t think that as their game has evolved and grown their business model has adjusted appropriately. It’s still being ran like a donation system where you get a small reward back, instead of a reasonably priced transaction when compared to the landscape.

Plus all of my feelings about it aside, I think they’d sell waaaaay more armor sets if the price looked better. My friends alone would drop way too much damn money on this game if the armor sets were like 10-15 bucks instead of noping out at the current price tag immediately."
pathofexile,ff850m2,t1_ff83dyk,1579666165.0,"Okay, but I think it’s pretty fair to say that the ratio is completely off. It’s like 95% of the good armor is in the cash shop.

Like I could spend 60 dollars on a full priced game and get plenty of armor sets, or you could spend sixty in this and get like 1.5 armor sets. And that doesn’t even include the cape or the alternate helmet designed for the set specifically.

I’m not saying they can’t do what they want, they can, but being free to play doesn’t mean that they have to do this *and* have loot boxes.

I personally know a ton of people who have seen how awful 99% of the base armor is, see the cost of buying MTX, and then just nope out from that whole thing.

On top of all of that I’d argue that stash tabs are almost mandatory, as I found managing loot while mapping miserable without the upgrades, and you’ll end up spending like sixty dollars on the ones you need of that!

There are people who would actively love and support the game if it was just a bit more balanced in that regard - maybe add some 15 dollar sets, maybe don’t charge 30 dollars for a single set of wings, maybe don’t do that and put loot boxes in on top of all that, etc.

I’m pretty new, and so far I think this game is great, but I think it’s marred by a business model that could be greatly improved.


That being said, from what I understand, they’re redoing armor models in PoE 2 so I’ll reserve some judgement for that. Maybe players will get some cool armor then!"

She’s not, in this direct quote, saying fitness makes you a Nazi, just that if you’re a Nazi you’re more likely to be into fitness, and that since he is a Nazi she wasn’t surprised he happened to like fitness - so her argument is that Nazis are into fitness, but not necessarily that everyone into fitness is a Nazi.

pathofexile,fepw6jr,t1_fepvnyv,1579333449.0,"I’ve played some builds of each class in D3 that had me cycling between every active skill I had and some that only required me to right click - so there is absolutely a spectrum to the complexity, but they lean more toward using most skills.

That being said, I’ve had to do far more micromanaging of things in D3 than I’ve yet had to do in PoE during combat. Things like charge barb have, at times, had a very specific playstyle that required you to know when to approach monsters and when to leave the pack behind because your legendary gems wouldn’t be able to keep up with the current density - or even having to use a freeze setup to drag mobs with you and keep a certain amount alive. Or things like knowing when to hit with your tornadoes vs. actual physical weapon on Whirlwind barb, etc.

It’s by no means the complexity of other genres, but compared to my PoE classes that I’ve pretty much pre-set to win before the fight even begins it is a different experience.

I love both games, but I think they deliver some very different experiences at times. 

Diablo gives you the tools to win the engagement, but expects you to execute well on it.

PoE tells you to go find the tools, build the toolbox, construct all of the build yourself, and then once put together the execution is almost guaranteed."
pathofexile,fepvb8q,t1_feplwqf,1579332589.0,"Not only are you correct, the devs themselves have said that this is a problem with PoE and they’re looking to move away from it in PoE 2 with the skill gem rework. They want players using more skills actively, rather than just turning most of their skills into passives and funneling all the power into a single skill.

I know this may make some people a little angry but in *some* ways D3 is more complex than PoE, and that’s definitely true in the actual action. 

Your builds are certainly more limited but in the second to second gameplay you are more actively engaged with skills that you have to manage, and more well telegraphed monster abilities you must react to.

PoE is still more complex, but its moment to moment gameplay requires fewer separate kinds of engagement from the player during the action itself.

Basically, Diablo 3 absolutely funnels you into certain builds, but each of those builds asks more from you in a strict number of actions sense.

Ideally PoE 2 will retain fantastic build variety, while enabling intra-build variety."

“They’re being so quiet about it!”

They’re quiet about almost all their major releases months out before a dedicated direct or portion of a direct kicks the marketing into gear.

Even then we’ve had a few trailers and general marketing stuff. 

“This other stuff was delayed!” Yeah, we’ve already had one for this game, in a sense. They wanted a 2019 release and then pushed it back for more polish, despite us never having a firm release date.

Cyberpunk is a ridiculously massive game with a lot riding on it, it’s delay is not that crazy. Avengers.. Avengers honestly disappointed a lot of people on announcement and this delay is likely very healthy for the game. And FF 7’s delay is like a month. It’s such a non issue that it’s obviously just for a tiny bit more breathing room, and likely so that it would hit in the following quarter because they knew Avengers would no longer be on their earnings report for that one due to its needed delay.

Like say the new game comes out and it’s amazing, so they keep the team on (which costs money) to make more furniture and maybe add more holidays. Should those have been in the base game? I mean, yeah, they would have made the base game better, but in a world where they can’t charge for it those things literally wouldn’t have existed. The team would have finished the amazing game and moved on to their next project. The game would have launched and that would have been it, nothing new would have ever been added.

At the end of the day even the best game is never “finished” because you could always add more to make it better. And once that happens someone inevitably thinks it should have been in the base game originally, but that’s just not feasible. Even if you work on a game for 70 years and then release it, in that next year your team could make something else that “should have been in the base game.”.

They’ve been a thing for awhile. They’ve been a thing for so long that I’ve actually seen fewer of them recently as games try different models. Nintendo may be behind yes, but even their season passes have really just been expansion packs with some side things added on. 

Charging for DLC isn’t necessarily a bad thing under the condition that it’s a substantial improvement, in my opinion, and as long as the base game was a complete experience. 

Nintendo does DLC now, it’s true. That being said you’re getting more for a game you love, assuming nothing was ripped from the main game. And Nintendo’s current DLC practice has been to deliver a finished, polished product and use paid for DLC to add more substantial things later and free updates for smaller things. Hopefully they stick with that practice, but I absolutely wouldn’t worry about them nickel and diming us currently.

Basically, as long as they don’t get greedy with it and the base game is fantastic good DLC will
likely be paid for - if they do any. The other alternative is that you don’t see any, or minor, support for the game after release.
