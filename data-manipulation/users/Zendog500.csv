I have a problem with the Regal app for my family getting seats together (2 adults, 2 kids) with our Unlimited Plan.  Since July 2019 I have sent emails suggestions to Regal with no responses.  We even made the issue known to the theater manager.  Glad to hear they may add a Family Plan like AMC. FYI- We have kids under 16 yrs and Regal customer service told us to just put the parent's age for kid in order to get the Unlimited Plan for them. So my kids have their own account.  

My family should be able to reserve or link all 4 seats together by one person!  This way I can reserve all 4 open seats at once.  Too often someone grabs the seat between before I can reserve all 4 seats. Another BIG issue with seating a family of 4 is that there is an app algorithm that ""REQUIRES 2 EMPTY SEATS BETWEEN YOUR SEAT AND THE NEXT RESERVED SEAT OR AISLE!!""  I understand they want those two seats for a couples like you as there are few people that come alone.  However, that stops a family from sitting together, because each reservation is made individually on the app.  We even tried hitting the ""reserve"" button at the same time..nope did not work!  Sure if we reserve 24 hrs in advance we are ok but we usually decide to go at the last minute.  We could also just show up at the concession stand and get our Unlimited Plan seats, but why have the app ?"
