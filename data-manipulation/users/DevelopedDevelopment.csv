The main argument against affordable healthcare is that you'd end up with overcrowding. Anyone from other countries doesn't have this problem, and that means there's a lot of people who aren't getting medical care. In the US, if one day affordable healthcare happened, there WOULD be an influx of patients, but it'd be temporary because those are all poor people who have been suffering without being able to pay. 

Another argument is that people wouldn't want to be doctors. That's wrong, many people do want to be doctors, the exorbitant costs for schooling stops them, and so does all the hard work to become one. They get blamed constantly for bills but in reality, those are administrative fees. I once mentioned that an argument against it was *slave doctors* and they were just boggled.
