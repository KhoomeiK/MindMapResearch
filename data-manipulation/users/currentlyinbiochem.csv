The design of the laptop you’re using is art. Art doesn’t need to have any meaning or purpose.

I’ll go first. About two years ago, I bought an Xbox from a friend and he gave me two controllers with it for a really good price. A couple days later I was hanging out with another friend (we’ll call him Alex) and we were messing around with the Xbox I had just bought. Alex asked me if he could borrow one of my controllers which I lent to him without a second thought. About a week goes by, and I’m wondering when Alex is going to be done using my controller because my girlfriend and I had been wanting to play some two player games. I call Alex and the conversation goes something like this:

Me: “Hey man, could I come pick up the controller I lent you soon?”

Alex: “Oh yeah I forgot to tell you I sold my Xbox”

Me: “... Okay... Could I just come to get my controller then?”

Alex: “Oh yeah man I sold that with my Xbox”

At this point I was completely blown away... He asked to borrow my controller and then sold it??? What the fuck?

Me: “Dude what the fuck? Those are expensive and you sold it???”

Alex: “Yeah dude sorry don’t worry I’ll buy you another one”

Fast forward a few weeks. I still hadn’t gotten a controller from this kid and I’m starting to get really annoyed. Eventually he calls me and tells me he bought me a new one. When he gets to my house, the conversation is as follows:

Me: “I really didn’t think you’d buy me another one man, haha thanks”

Alex: “Welllll, I didn’t buy a new one. I got this one from \*another kid in our grade\*.”

He pulls out the controller and hands it to me. The left joystick is missing, which makes this thing completely useless. At this point I was fed up with this guys bullshit and told him to leave. Our friendship still hasn’t recovered all the way, and I doubt it ever will. I have a hard time trusting someone that pulls shit like that.

tl;dr: I bought an Xbox that came two controllers. A friend asked to borrow one and ended up selling it with his Xbox without telling me. Instead of buying me a new one, he gives me a broken controller that’s missing the left joystick."
