I totally jumped on his bandwagon again after the Lions and Cowboys games only for him to go right back to being a shit QB. Mitch is either really good or really bad. We cant have that level of inconsistency from our starter (they need to be good more often than bad and their bad can't be as bad as Mitch's at his most bad). He's never going to play like the #2 pick and he's never going to be an all-pro, he wont go to any more pro-bowls and he isn't going to play each week with the same level of consistency. We need to draft a QB and sign a free agent (but not another Mike Glennon train-wreck) to give this team the best chance to win in our division."

I think the biggest difference is vigilantism.
