videos,fgiv7e2,t1_fgiqbfl,1580831629.0,"I think the problem is that for some people, ""equal rights"" means the ability to treat the other side as unfairly as they'd been treated in the past. I feel like lasting change is hindered by the few people who are ultimately motivated by revenge. Recognizing these cases and speaking out against them would probably go a long way toward maintaining a truly equal system."

GetMotivated,fgep5rk,t3_exzrf8,1580705405.0,"That's awesome. I've recently started to notice how much stress cluttered areas cause me subconsciously. The few times that I've had my desk, or like, kitchen counter cleared off and organized, I noticed a wave of relaxation coming over me when walking into the room. It's kind of subtle, but I think it affects my general disposition a lot more than I would've thought in the past. The hardest part is budgeting time to immediately pick up after myself once I finish a task. Anyway, keep it up!"
gifs,fge6vlg,t1_fg87grv,1580692727.0,"It could be titled VHF. U22 upgrades to a VHF station; the only problem is that it's late 2008, right before the digital switch, so instead of switching to digital, they keep operating on the old analog frequency, as a pirate TV station. This shit basically writes itself."
aww,fge5pyj,t1_fgcrl3m,1580691952.0,I don't think anyone is feigning ignorance. I think it's more that the notion that slang like that only comes from black people is so passe that it's hard to perceive your comment itself as anything other than ignorant.
