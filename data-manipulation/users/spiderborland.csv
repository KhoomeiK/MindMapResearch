After Judge Dennis Reinaker was pulled over in April, he got out of the vehicle and confronted the officer. At one point he said to the officer, “You better check the registration on this plate soon, mister.”

The officer pulled Reinaker over for driving too closely to another vehicle.

In his only TV interview, Reinaker watched the dashcam video with WGAL. He said he was not trying to use his position to influence the officer but regretted his actions.

The board could have filed charges in the Court of Judicial Discipline but decided not to.

The board instead issued a Letter of Counsel to Reinaker, saying the incident can be used against him if there are future complaints."
