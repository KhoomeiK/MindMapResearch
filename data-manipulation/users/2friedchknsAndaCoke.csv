Tricare and Medicare have limits on what they will compensate doctors --- basically they have their own [chargebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeDOQpfaUc8). 

So when a hospital tries to charge you $20 for a single 400mg ibuprofen (which they do partially to pay for people who have no insurance, and partially just because they fucking can) Tricare/Medicare/Medicaid goes, ""nah, we know the actual market value for that is fifty cents so we will give you $1."" 

All insurance companies currently do this, which is why you have doctors who won't accept certain types of insurance. But if EVERYONE had the same insurance, it combines our bargaining power with the industry. No more markup if they can only get paid at one rate, and if the only other option is to *not get paid at all* then they'll figure it the fuck out. Currently, it is difficult to find private providers that take Medicare/Tricare because of the lower compensation (and if you live within 50 miles of a military medical facility, servicemembers are required to go there for that reason).

This is also the reason any sort of ""transitional"" form (like Buttigieg's or even Warren's plan to an extent) of offering a public option and then hoping people will switch over won't work because the providers don't have an incentive to change how they price things--you'll just see shit like Hillary's HMO plan from the 90s---limited choices for providers and shittier care on the public option."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fd6u6iw,t1_fd5zyyz,1578195758.0,"in a school situation where kids aren't used to seeing it I understand the questions (as tiring as they may be) but this video---don't touch other people's bodies! Hair is part of their body! How hard is that, actually? It's the same as people touching a pregnant belly like it's not still part of the mother's body. DON'T DO IT."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fd6thnd,t3_ek1i1f,1578195506.0,"The first time i really understood this was working in a primarily AA school as a white person. I had 8 year olds petting my hair asking how I got it so soft and I said ""well that's just how it grows out of my head, just like yours is perfect for those pretty braids"" (right or wrong I was 23 at the time and had no idea how to react I hope that was the right thing to say). 

THAT SAID there's a big difference between curious children and full fucking grown adults who should know better."
todayilearned,fd4nzbw,t1_fd2oy2h,1578169326.0,"But instead of actually saying ""oh I wish I'd realized I could do that"" he has to make some smarmy ""clever"" nickname for you...the emotional bullying (even low level stuff like that) that goes on in the Boomer generation rather than *possibly admit how they did things could be wrong* is just mind boggling."
wholesomememes,fczk95b,t1_fczdqd6,1578103070.0,I feel the same way. Also with social hangout stuff..people will generally go if I ask but I have to be the one who asks. It’s exhausting being the only person making an effort

ChoosingBeggars,fcxj1v6,t3_ejewev,1578064157.0,This special breed of military wife is called a “dependapotamus”
oddlysatisfying,fcwasnt,t1_fcuwnyy,1578021101.0,Yeah I think the Black and Tan speckles will be the one that ends up looking “dated” especially if it was done in tiles and not slab
