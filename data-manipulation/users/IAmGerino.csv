Where I’m from if you attend the wedding festivities (i.e. not just the church/office actual getting married part), then yes, you are expected to include around $100 per person in the mandatory card. You might find annotations like “no flowers”, often with suggestions like “...instead you can bring pet food which we will later donate to a shelter” or “...lotto tickets welcome instead”. 

As main gift, physical presents are not a thing really.

The only scenario I can think of where one would specifically notify guests to not bring presents is if they are doing something very low-key, like a small dinner.

Mind you, traditionally the weddings are a big party, with limitless alcohol, 4-5 courses of food and they end when everyone is done, so e.g. 8AM ;)"

I usually try to make sure that I’m just getting more or less what I paid for, not because I’m cheap or sth, I just don’t think I should be footing the bill for company’s screw up, which is, I hope, a socially acceptable viewpoint.

The last time I went onto longish calls with Customer Support and was pressing them was when my ISP made a mistake and it took them a month longer to hook my internet. I of course got them to cancel the bill for the first month, but I was still locked in with them and had no internet, so after some back and forth I got like 50GB data for my mobile so I can use it at home as an internet source, and a promise that they will add more GB if I ran out.
