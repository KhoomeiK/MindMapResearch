Orks in particular have been known to seize and repurpose Imperial facilities for their own use. 

Some will spend some time to fortify existing structures. Adding sandbags and digging trenches, maybe adding some hardware to turn an office into HQ.

As for building a base from the ground up, tents and prefabricated habs transported from orbit are likely to be the main bulk of it, at least for Imperials. Hydra batteries, walls, barracks, mess hall, comms, HQ, storage, maintenance, etc. Orks might just hammer some scrap together to similar purposes. More permanent structures could be errected during a longer conflict. 

As for harvesting resources and constructing wargear, few will make new facilities in the middle of a war zone (ork's being a notable exception and even they will loot as much as possible). Weapons and resources will be sent from facilities that were made prior to the conflict (or created elsewhere during the conflict). However, it's not uncommon to attack manufacturing or resource-extraction facilities in order to deny it to the enemy or seize it for yourself.

I haven't read a lot of 40k literature, but like the Ciaphas Cain series. While the story follows the titular commissar, he encounters numerous foes. 

The 4th novel, *Death or Glory* (included in the 2nd omnibus, *Defender of the Imperium*) has him stranded far behind enemy lines in ork-controlled territory. It mentions orkish dietary tastes and their treatment of slaves. He also ends up getting acquainted with their vehicles. The story really highlights how terrible orks can be. There is some humor, but the orks are no laughing matter. This is novel actually takes place before all of the others chronologically (though some short stories come before it) and should be light on spoilers.

The 2nd novel, *Caves of Ice*, and the 8th, *Duty Calls*, (found in the 1st and 3rd omnibuses respectively) also include ork's, but, as is common in Cain stories, there is a 3rd party in the conflict.

- Sarah is scolded for using a shrink wand (though who on is different).

They can even normally be recharged with solar energy or in a fire, but those aren't listed in the minimum requirements.
