AskReddit,fej5x3e,t1_fej5hxz,1579158193.0,"Ya, I can understand where you're coming from. Right now I'm reading, The Lord of The Rings franchise. For some odd reason, I've yet to see the movies. But I'll probably finish the books first, then watch the movies. But I'm also reading other books along side it, Dune and Sword of Destiny. They are all great books.

unpopularopinion,fehjdgh,t1_fehfv04,1579117737.0,What?
unpopularopinion,fehg6e7,t1_fehfnwz,1579115868.0,"Well, I can see where you're coming from. But think of movie-making from a production standpoint. Ofcourse the producers will invest more in these movies because most of the time they are sure that they will make a return. 

But I agree. The movie industry could invest more in different kinds of movies than only one. Maybe they could or should, strike a balance between the two."
unpopularopinion,fehfrav,t1_fehf2i9,1579115621.0,"Maybe. But there's still some stigma surrounding it. Atleast in my country, there still is."

unpopularopinion,fehfhqf,t1_fehefrj,1579115463.0,"These movies aren't meant to be taken seriously. They are popcorn flicks, that are meant to be enjoyed with family and friends. These movies earn billions, ofcourse the actors will earn more because of it. Not all movies have to be intellectual masterpieces. It's okay to have movies where you can just sit back, relax and go on an epic adventure for 2 to 3 hours."
unpopularopinion,fehc2xm,t1_feh6awb,1579113487.0,"What are you talking about? I'm not asking anyone to follow me. I was just sharing my opinion. I'm not saying people should be bad. I'm not saying that my words are the ultimate truth. All I did was look into myself, look at the world distantly, and this is what I came up with. Objective reality and subjective reality are real things. Maybe you should do a little research before accusing me of rallying people into doing bad things."

unpopularopinion,fegtxls,t1_fegth1s,1579102454.0,"If I would've just said, ""Right and wrong is different from person to person,"" it wouldn't have explained my point of view properly. I was simply trying to elaborate what my thought process was. If that makes you think I was trying to showoff, so be it."
unpopularopinion,fegt6yu,t1_fegsx6p,1579101975.0,Just because I'm trying to have a conversation doesn't mean I'm trying to show off. What's the matter with you?
unpopularopinion,fegspov,t1_fegs12p,1579101653.0,"What I meant when I said that there is no right and wrong wasn't referring to the subjective world. I was referring to it objectively. No one's arguing about its existence in the subjective world. My post was about it not existing in the objective world. It's real, but at the same time, it ain't. It's stuck in this weird superposition. The actions that'll be taken due to certain feelings are real and objective, but the feelings surrounding it are subjective. Not unreal, but can be different from person to person, therefore, no true right and wrong. No clear distinction."
AskReddit,fegrkip,t1_fegre2d,1579100885.0,"So then you should've said that nudity in movies is wrong. My question isn't about other people, it's about you, as an individual."
AskReddit,fegrcm7,t1_fegr680,1579100733.0,So then why are you saying it's fine?
unpopularopinion,fegr96w,t1_fegq8wj,1579100668.0,"Okay, here's the thing. It exists. Only in the subjective realm. You feelings, or other people's feelings can be different. Therefore, all of it is subjective. There is no one true feeling. Each individual might have different feelings about the same event. The event happening is objective, but the feelings surrounding it are all subjective. They are all different. They will all perceive the right and wrong of the situation differently. Therefore your feelings aren't objective, therefore morality is not objective because it is directly correlated with people's feelings. When so many people have so many different ways of looking at the same thing, it's not objective. The thing might be objective, not the thoughts. Cause they can be vastly different from person to person."
AskReddit,fegqjtw,t1_fegqbns,1579100185.0,"Ya, that can be awkward."

unpopularopinion,fegpix7,t1_fegfb53,1579099476.0,"Your feelings towards something isn't objectivity. An objective thing exists even without you. Rivers flow, sun shines, wind blows, those are objective things. So, your feeling of bleakness towards a certain topic is subjective, cause once you die, you'll die with that feeling. And your feelings can be argued with. You can't argue with the, for example, the sun. Or, you can't argue saying that the sun sets in the east and rises in the west. Feelings are always in spiral, forever changing. Birth and death is objective, but the inbetween, that's all subjective."
unpopularopinion,fegoewa,t1_fegnrp0,1579098689.0,Sorry to disappoint you.
unpopularopinion,fego6vk,t1_fegelqw,1579098529.0,"Well, as you can see, there are people in the comments who are arguing about it, so... There are people who think I'm some kind of a ""Sociopath""."
unpopularopinion,fego1f5,t1_fegnrmd,1579098419.0,"Are you stupid? Did you even read the rest of it? What I was talking about is that objectively there is no right and wrong. But in our subjective world, it exists. I'm not telling people they should start a genocide, but I'm simply looking at the topic of right and wrong from an unbiased, objective observer standpoint. One shouldn't kill and rape. But in the  grand scheme of things, from a universal standpoint, it's meaningless. Even from a molecular standpoint, it's meaningless. Or are you not aware of what subjectivity and objectivity is?"
unpopularopinion,fegnq4h,t1_fegnbll,1579098186.0,Na. You do it first. I'll follow your lead.
unpopularopinion,fegniwj,t1_feglube,1579098038.0,"Just because I think about stuff, doesn't mean I'll act on them. Don't try to act as if you've never thought about doing anything wrong in your life. Don't try to act as if you only think good about others and you are a selfless being. It's not my fault that you have a problem with free thinking."
unpopularopinion,fegnaa0,t1_fegcbpc,1579097859.0,"Well, I will. Thank you for recommending it. You must be well-versed in those stuff."
unpopularopinion,fege8b4,t1_fegdzct,1579089660.0,"It's not bleak. It's just what it is. The feeling attached to it is your doing. It can be a positive feeling, a negative, or completely neutral. In my case, completely neutral."
unpopularopinion,fegdvd5,t1_fegdpv8,1579089255.0,"Ya, that's what I'm saying. There's right and wrong in our subjective worlds. It is also dependent on the observer. The one torturing might think they are doing the right thing but the one getting tortured might think it's bad or evil. But objectively, there is no way to measure whether the act is bad or not bad."
unpopularopinion,fegdo3q,t1_fegdf9w,1579089023.0,"Ya, it'll be smarter. But that's not objectivity. Objectivity can't be argued. It's forever true. One can't argue it. It'll be ""better"" in our own subjective worlds, not the objective reality. What is better, compared to maybe some other unfounded civilization we're years behind. That's not objective. We aren't the best. It'll always change. ""Better"" is subjective."
unpopularopinion,fegdel1,t1_fegcdkj,1579088714.0,I'm glad to be here.
unpopularopinion,fegd3t5,t1_fegcqjj,1579088355.0,How's that? How can one *objectively* argue moral and ethics?
unpopularopinion,fegd2ke,t1_fegcsy8,1579088314.0,Is that so? Then why are some people trying to argue my point and calling me a 'Sociopath' in the comments?
unpopularopinion,fegci3z,t1_fegcbla,1579087622.0,"Tell me. Do you know what objectivity is? To be objective it to be present. There can't be any arguments about it. Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, that's objective. We live and die, that's objective. What you're talking about, can be argued, depending on one's view of what's right and wrong. 
A psychopath might piss on a baby, cause in their subjective world, it's okay."
unpopularopinion,fegcar7,t1_fegc9q4,1579087366.0,I'll take that as a compliment.
unpopularopinion,fegbf7y,t3_ehe3qf,1579086213.0,"I mean, this subreddit is named, 'unpopularopinion', but only the popular opinions get upvoted and reach the hot page. The truly unpopular posts get downvoted and get buried in new. If so many people agree with what you're saying, your opinion is not really unpopular. It's the ones that get downvoted, those are the ones that are truly deserving of the 'unpopularopinion' title."
unpopularopinion,fefwrns,t1_fees9vs,1579067744.0,"Okay, here's my question. Say you know almost everything that's going on in the present political climate. You know who's winning, who's losing. You know what rules are being made or tweaked. But, would all that information ever come into practical usage? Would you go out there and rally people if you think the people are going to suffer injustice because of some new rule? Would you do that? Are you that kind of a person? Cause if you are, good, you should know the political climate. But if you aren't, knowing the news won't really make much difference. It would be like knowing Trivia, you know stuff but there's not necessarily any practical usage for it. You're no different than someone who doesn't know politics. Cause neither you nor that person will do or act on the gathered or absent information. It's only passive information you're gathering with no endgame."
unpopularopinion,fefvdf6,t1_feegiqr,1579066416.0,"Oh, look at you. So smart! I'm sorry, man. You must know everything in this world."
unpopularopinion,fee7vcb,t1_fee6ldb,1579028209.0,"You've already made-up your mind. What's the point of arguing with you. You've already put yourself up on a pedestal of ultimate truth. So, it's no point arguing with you. It'll be like yelling at a wall. And even if one doesn't follow politics at all, doesn't mean they are stupid. It's just that their priorities are different than your's. You might know more about politics, but the other person might know more about some other topic. So, yes, they maybe oblivious when it comes to the political world, but they aren't stupid. It's stupid of you to believe they are."
unpopularopinion,fee6zee,t1_fee64kz,1579027689.0,"You're contradicting yourself. At first you say following politics doesn't make you smart but after you say, only smart people follow politics. At first you say not following politics doesn't make you dumb but after you say dumb people don't follow it. What are you trying to say? 
And, ya, I never said it's bad to follow politics. The only problem I have with it is when people use politics to make themselves seem superior. Everyone should be somewhat aware of what's happening around them, but constantly following it like a dog chasing a bone is unnecessary and unproductive. You'll only be watching people bark about the same topic for days."
unpopularopinion,fee6b41,t1_fee56z2,1579027293.0,"I never said that one should be completely oblivious to what's happening. All I'm saying is that, constantly checking what's happening isn't necessary. It isn't productive. You're only watching people yell about the same things for days with no movement forward. It's no better than wasting your time watching Talk-Shows. And do you really believe you're smarter than other people just because you follow politics, and they are stupid?"
unpopularopinion,fee4piq,t1_fee3c2u,1579026343.0,"Atleast you know where you stand and you're honest about it. But, some people behave like the smartest person alive just because they know a few things more than you."
unpopularopinion,fee4180,t1_fee3ljd,1579025946.0,"True, I'm not saying one should completely disregard politics. But acting superior just because you know a few things more, that I hate."
unpopularopinion,fee3rg8,t1_fee2q2g,1579025786.0,"Ya, that's the thing. The people who follow politics might be ""politics woke"" but he/she might not know what's happening in the movie industry for example. So, wokeness can be different from people to people. Just because you're woke in politics, doesn't mean your wokeness is better than their wokeness. So, people shouldn't act so superior, just because they know about politics. The other person might know more about books or sports or games or any other topic."
unpopularopinion,fee2zb6,t1_fee2qvs,1579025322.0,True. I'm not saying one should be completely oblivious to what's happening. But constantly searching for what's happening isn't exactly needed.
unpopularopinion,fee2t25,t1_fee2o0u,1579025220.0,Relevance of a topic is subjective. Maybe for you it's important. But other people might not care about it much.

unpopularopinion,fee2gwq,t1_fee288g,1579025019.0,"You might have knowledge about politics, but they might have more knowledge about something else. Just because you know more about politics, doesn't mean you're better than them. They might know more about sports, and you might not know anything."

unpopularopinion,fedy2yc,t1_fedxfrh,1579022321.0,"Well, they are both different. Alien is a more claustrophobic movie. It's leaning more towards horror. But Aliens is a more action-heavy movie. I like and dislike both of them for different reasons. But I will say, I prefer Alien more than Aliens."

unpopularopinion,fedwzjz,t1_fedwapj,1579021662.0,"I guess this kind of style suits TV shows more than movies. Cause an average movie is only about 2 hours long. And in that 2 hours, I want to feel invested, excited, and I want to take something away from it. Not be bored by it. In that 2 hours, I don't want to see a guy eat noodles. If I wanted to do that, I would open YouTube. It feels like the director was only trying to pad the run-time."

But I've a problem with movie that are slow *and* boring. Some of my favorite movies are slower paced. But they aren't boring."

unpopularopinion,fe0ukra,t3_enl26a,1578818812.0,"Well, I don't know what war movies you're watching, but most of the good ones don't really glorify violence. Examples, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, The Pianist, etc. These movies are made not to show that killing is good, it's the opposite. It's to show how devastating all of it is. How superficial all of it is. How because of a few people in power, so many others suffer. These war movies aren't meant to be taken inspiration from, they are meant to make you feel disgust. Disgust for violence and bloodshed. Their main goal is to show, war is hell."
