relationships,fenxufr,t3_eq08uz,1579292443.0,"This whole thread freaked me out and reminded me so much of my ex. 

Its scary to think you fall in love with someone whos actually a different person. 

After about a year my ex completely stopped trying to please me. He would say that he shows he loves me through sex, but besides that he never showed he cared. I always had to ask to go over his house and his response always was well Ill be here so whatever and he rarely came to my house. I asked if he wanted to move in together since he was moving off campus and my roommate left me and he made up some excuse about Im too messy when in reality his room was only clean because I cleaned it. 

This went on for about two more years until I found out the last year he had been cheating on me and moved in with his new girlfriend of 4 months. 

Im happy I got out of it because it was so mentally abusing that I hated myself, and I didnt even realize it until I got out and started loving myself again.

I hope everyone in a situation like this gets out and gets help and finds someone who truly cares and loves them!"
festivals,fenwh8b,t1_fenum57,1579291887.0,"Lol the last festival I went too I took molly, like a mircodose and it was fine and I felt it for sure but I ended up babysitting my friend because everyone else was too messed up and couldnt fully enjoy myself.but I didnt end up feeling it when I went to work Monday still and could barley type."

college,fekh2ji,t3_epjhi2,1579199896.0,"I wouldnt say be mean but like maybe ask about why he is doing these things. Maybe he doesnt know any better. My ex in college had a roommate who showered one time a week and living in Florida and being a bigger dude he fucking smelled, like badly. But we found out that he didnt know he was supposed to shower daily. He was kind of neglected as a kid and left to fend for himself so he didnt understand. 

Maybe asking him why he does it would be better then straight up being like you smell dude."
vegetarian,fekgkyg,t3_epk8vq,1579199605.0,"I find this a lot with people who are vegan in general, but especially new vegans. Its like a shove in your face type deal. Its super annoying. I dont openly tell people Im a vegetarian and dont judge people who eat meat, because it doesnt involve me.

The last festival I went to we Uberd the first two days and I drove the last. Getting there was fine (expensive but fine) coming back was a bitch we ended up having to walk almost 10 miles away from grounds to even be able to have an Uber pick us up within the next two/three hours, and after being fucked up all day it was annoying. 

Driving wasnt bad but again, kind of annoying to find parking."
bonnaroo,fehsbx5,t3_ep6e1p,1579122898.0,I could definitely see my old psychology high school teacher going to festivals. One time I saw him hotboxing his car driving up to campus. We love cool teachers!!
vegetarian,fehkqhj,t1_fehbr0k,1579118527.0,"Ive definitely gotten better about it the past few months. I kind of spilled off the track of doing 80/20 the November/December but for the new year I decided to cut it out completely. I got really sick over Christmas and it felt like my stomach was being grabbed and twisted and the only reason I could come too was that it was the meat. 

Honestly I havent really wanted meat since then so its been pretty easy, and Ive been looking up a lot of receipts to make sure Im eating enough protein. Also I really love vegan protein powders for work outs."
relationships,fegzju9,t3_ep2ow9,1579105999.0,"My ex and I were like this. And once I stopped wanting to have so much sex our relationship took a turn. My love language is quality time and he doesnt believe love languages are real but always said that he expresses how he feels through sex. 

I would sit down and have a conversation with him and have him take the love language quiz. His love language might be physical touch and thats why he equates sex to it. 

Good luck out there! Relationships are hard."
bonnaroo,fegzach,t1_fegwzhq,1579105836.0,Yes please!!! Im trying to go HARD
college,fegsfzu,t3_ep1or8,1579101473.0,"You can for sure. There are healthy options in most college markets. 

But I dont think the freshman 15 comes from unhealthy eating choices. It comes from drinking/partying, stress and unhealthy sleeping patterns. And not staying active. 

College is VERY different then high school for many reasons and no matter what kind of person you were in high school, college hits different. 

Personally I would suggest trying not to stress about gaining weight, try your hardest to eat right and stay active."
SugarDatingForum,fegs3jx,t3_ep29n3,1579101240.0,Dont fly to him without making sure you can confirm he is who he says he is. Video chat of some kind and while on video chat ask for a tour of the house so you can get a feel for him. It seems too good to be true and like something would end up falling through.

HangoutFest,fe9we9u,t1_fe9qamg,1578942041.0,No problem. I ended up not going last year and selling my ticket so I didnt keep up with the news as much as I am this year because I didnt want to disappoint myself.

I have a similar situation although not so extreme that maybe will help you feel better about your choice to move. I graduated college in 2016 and got a state job a year later, I dont make a whole lot of money, but enough to support myself. Ive always made things work even when I was broke, and if I asked to borrow money from my mom I would pay it back in a month or less. I bought a car about a year and a half ago, and my mom told me I was selfish for buying a car when I knew she was struggling (I pay our cell phone every month and normally give her between 100-200 monthly for her bills). I tried explaining my car needed so much money in work and was literally falling apart and she didnt understand and didnt talk to me for about a week. She was still mad but she got over it because again, its my money and I should be able to do what I want with it. 

Fast forward to present day, the past two months Ive paid half of my moms rent (on top of my own) and paid for two eight hour trips home to be with her for the holidays plus back paid her car payment which she is 2 months behind on. She asked me for money last week and I straight up said no, mostly because I didnt have it, and she got mad. She said if you dont hwve money to give me then you shouldnt be buying festival tickets I calmly explained to her that it is my money to do what I want with, I pay my bills and some of hers every month, and if she cant handle it then she needs to figure it out like an adult. 

Im planning on moving home in the summer and I know its going to be a pain for me and Ill end up spending more then Im saving. But I have to move home (different story). 

Anyway, the point of me sharing this long story is that hopefully your parents will realize that youre not doing anything wrong. Its a different time and its not a bad thing to be an independent women and be able to be on your own, because overall you have you and thats it. 

I hope things get better for you."

Dont get me wrong I still had an AMAZING time and it definitely helped me make my transition into fest life but going from stage to stage was hard, especially if you are crunched for time.

The interest rates are very high, and it ended up costing a lot more after school but honestly I think it was worth it in the end. That semester I got my grades up to what they needed to be and was able to get my financial aid back the next semester to continue. 

Although I still struggled I think that it helped me a lot. I knew getting a degree was something important to me, and I couldnt really afford out of pocket. 

I think honestly you need to consider all your options, it sounds like your situation might be a little more intense then mine was so maybe taking a semester off can help you regroup and get on the correct meds that can help you in the long run! 

There is no shame in putting yourself first, always remember that! You and your mental health is the most important thing. School and work will always be there! Keep us updated on what happens!"

Honestly fuck em, if they are making fun of you for being a couple years older then you they are immature. Keep the friends you have and forget about the rest!

It’s scary to think you fall in love with someone who’s actually a different person. 

After about a year my ex completely stopped trying to please me. He would say that he shows he loves me through sex, but besides that he never showed he cared. I always had to ask to go over his house and his response always was “well I’ll be here so whatever” and he rarely came to my house. I asked if he wanted to move in together since he was moving off campus and my roommate left me and he made up some excuse about “I’m too messy” when in reality his room was only clean because I cleaned it. 

This went on for about two more years until I found out the last year he had been cheating on me and moved in with his new girlfriend of 4 months. 

I’m happy I got out of it because it was so mentally abusing that I hated myself, and I didn’t even realize it until I got out and started loving myself again.

I hope everyone in a situation like this gets out and gets help and finds someone who truly cares and loves them!"

I have a similar situation although not so extreme that maybe will help you feel better about your choice to move. I graduated college in 2016 and got a state job a year later, I don’t make a whole lot of money, but enough to support myself. I’ve always made things work even when I was broke, and if I asked to borrow money from my mom I would pay it back in a month or less. I bought a car about a year and a half ago, and my mom told me I was selfish for buying a car when I knew she was struggling (I pay our cell phone every month and normally give her between 100-200 monthly for her bills). I tried explaining my car needed so much money in work and was literally falling apart and she didn’t understand and didn’t talk to me for about a week. She was still mad but she got over it because again, it’s my money and I should be able to do what I want with it. 

Fast forward to present day, the past two months I’ve paid half of my moms rent (on top of my own) and paid for two eight hour trips home to be with her for the holidays plus back paid her car payment which she is 2 months behind on. She asked me for money last week and I straight up said no, mostly because I didn’t have it, and she got mad. She said “if you don’t hwve money to give me then you shouldn’t be buying festival tickets” I calmly explained to her that it is my money to do what I want with, I pay my bills and some of hers every month, and if she can’t handle it then she needs to figure it out like an adult. 

I’m planning on moving home in the summer and I know it’s going to be a pain for me and I’ll end up spending more then I’m saving. But I have to move home (different story). 

Anyway, the point of me sharing this long story is that hopefully your parents will realize that you’re not doing anything wrong. It’s a different time and it’s not a bad thing to be an independent women and be able to be on your own, because overall you have you and that’s it. 

I hope things get better for you."

Also Hello fellow Tampa friend!!!!!!"

I’ve loved raw veggies since I was a kid, but roasted really changed the game. With potatoes or rice or a meatless sausage."

You’ll realize how much better you are without her honestly. It seems like she’s been using you anyways and you’re worth more than that. She can’t expect things she can’t give you back."
vegetarian,fcv411x,t1_fcuvhjn,1577994195.0,"I have not. I like the “beyond meat” brand for certain things but I can’t seem to find it locally. 

I’ll have to try the quorn though!"

SugarDatingForum,fclnvj9,t1_fclf9nx,1577752207.0,"I understand that completely. I was like that when I was first on SA, well the free spirited crazy part, not the broke, ghetto car, no phone part. I didn’t get very far because a lot of the men wanted a “needy” baby and I wasn’t that (and still not) a needy person. I don’t knock the hustle at all."
offmychest,fclfvti,t3_ehobx5,1577746840.0,I work for CPS and have had to make calls! You may feel shitty but it’s the best thing to do for those kids and your friend. She might feel trapped and now has a good reason to get out and help her kids and herself! You did a good thing!
SugarDatingForum,fclehs4,t1_fcj6su5,1577745932.0,"Omg I’m laughing so hard at the comment:  most have $34 dollars in their bank account, their car has three lights and bald tires, phone screen cracked and a 48 hour notice. 

It’s sad but true."
college,fciu5pu,t3_ehd52i,1577669882.0,"I’m 25 and just finished my BA after taking three years off. 

You’re not old, you just know there is more to life then going out and getting fucked up every night. 

Going back to school later made me do a lot better, I was more focused and put school and work before going on. It felt so good to not have to beg teachers for extra credit or a passing grade and know I worked for what I got. 

Honestly fuck em, if they are making fun of you for being a couple years older then you they are immature. Keep the friends you have and forget about the rest!

Also should note at 25 you don’t need to have your life together. You just need to know what you want and keep working for it. Everyone’s pace is different and timing is different, you’re doing what you need to do."
festivals,fc1pmsi,t1_fc1pblv,1577325738.0,"This should say people that can’t handle their alcohol a and drink at festivals are the worse. 

I smoke but it can sometimes make me tired so I drink at festivals and shows. But I’m also not an asshole so I guess I feel different about it."
festivals,fbtaot6,t1_fbt9xps,1577072954.0,That would be awesome honestly!
