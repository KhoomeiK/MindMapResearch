EatingDisorderHope,ff1hygs,t3_er4lxd,1579479512.0,Just tell myself my body needs food to live and its nothing to feel guilty for!!!! Whenever I have a bad thought/urge I immediately combat it with a positive one.
EatingDisorderHope,ff1bzzh,t3_er1afu,1579477329.0,What helped me was time and tough love. I was 19 and 70 pounds..severly bulimic/anorexic and refused any help. I did end up in the hospital at one point  because I was bleeding internally in my stomach ..thats where I was actually diagnosed with anorexia and I was offered treatment during my time there but I refused and I was an adult and no one could force me. My parents had enough and said they wouldnt watch me kill myself and kicked me out. It took years even after all of that but it really just came down to me wanting to live. It took time but I healed from it and became a normal weight. I am 30 now and  I still have intrusive thoughts about my body and food all of the time but I've taught myself to ignore those thoughts.  Everyone is different with recovery.. Its something that will always stay with you but you've got to want to beat it. I would also agree with the meal prepping and weight lifting/excersice ..Those relieve so much stress for me too! I also am very open with my husband about it and if I have bad thoughts or if I feel guilty about something I ate he helps get my mind back on track. Sending lots of love and light your way... Recovery is possible and you can do it!

AskReddit,fd70yrz,t3_ejxtkl,1578198118.0,From an early age I decided that I did not want children and at 30 I still feel that way. I guess I really had to make the decision when I got engaged at 27 and had to speak to my husband about it- he didnt want kids either so that really made me decide fully not to. I have never had that desire to be a mother... Sometimes I feel sad about it only because I know my parents want grandchildren. I enjoy my life as it is and kids absolutely 100% would ruin it. I am the mother of two cats though and they are fantastic boys.
