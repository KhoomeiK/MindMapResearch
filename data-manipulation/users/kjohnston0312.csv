And if you every want to have a conversation like a grown-up, maybe don't say someone is ""harping""."
unpopularopinion,ff3xvfs,t1_ff2i3pv,1579551236.0,"You sound like the ""data denying"" redneck. They are NOT all bred to be more aggressive. But they are forced into that situation when raised by assholes like Michael Vick, and his ilk. Not the dog - just the dog owner."

unpopularopinion,ff3xq7t,t1_ff2ttcu,1579551147.0,Where did you get this information? Even the CDC claims to not know what breeds were involved?
unpopularopinion,ff3xofv,t1_ff2s9uk,1579551117.0,"I call bull on this.  This is a quote from Steve Dale, who is an advocate for animals and has over 40 years of experience in the field. ""The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said there were 36 fatal dog attacks nationwide in 2015, the most recent year for which figures are available. There is no indication of what breeds are involved because the CDC stopped reporting breed many years ago because the information “isn’t relevant,” not to mention that breeds are often misidentified."" So, not sure where you found your information, but mine is from verifiable sources."
unpopularopinion,ff3xh13,t1_ff3hlke,1579550987.0,"Yes, he did have Staffies. But you can't paint an entire breed of dog as bad, when you hear of the horrific things he did to the dogs. What animal wouldn't become vicious when in fear for its life?"
unpopularopinion,ff3x4ny,t1_ff2nive,1579550772.0,"The key thought here - she was a rescue. When an animal has been turned in to a shelter or abandoned, they usually have issues. Issues caused by their owners. They are not born this way."
unpopularopinion,ff3wyyq,t1_ff2euvn,1579550671.0,I know more chihuahuas that are likely to bite than Staffies. All dogs have an inbred ability to fight if provoked or threatened. To say that they have genetic traits is inaccurate.
unpopularopinion,ff3wm8h,t3_er65w8,1579550446.0,"And by the way, there is no actual ""Pit Bull"" breed."
unpopularopinion,ff3wjbm,t3_er65w8,1579550395.0,"Where did you get this information? It so beyond incorrect. I suggest you go to ""Steve Dale's Pet World"" and read some of his columns on breed specific legislation. He is an animal behaviorist, columnist, and animal activist. What you are saying is what causes problems. Pit Bulls are only bad when they have been raised by people that provoke them into bad behavior, much like people. If you treat something or someone badly, they will behave badly. Were your aware that at one time Pit bulls were referred to as the ""Nanny Dog"" for the protective, yet gentle behavior. You're the one that is irresponsible. By spewing anecdotal stories and claiming them as fact, you spread misinformation, and that is irresponsible. So, if you want to keep up this line of reasoning, how about backing it up with some actual facts. Facts that can be verified."

relationship_advice,ff3v8jf,t3_eregee,1579549589.0,"I have no good advice, but will tell you I was on the opposite end of a similar situation many years ago. I opted to leave my husband, it was that important to me. I will say that ultimatum is strong. That's the same term my ex-husband used with me. But, I simply think it's a decision. I left him and married someone who wanted kids, and I've never looked back. Did I love my ex-husband. I did. Was it difficult. Indeed. Would he have made a good father. No. Not at all. If you don't want them, don't hold her back until it's too late for her. She'll only end up resenting you. Are you a shit for changing your mind. No. It happens. Better you don't have them, if you don't want them. But don't break her heart anymore than you probably already have."

That being said, I did not push her in any direction. I simply followed her lead. It sounds like you're doing everything right. I don't have any real information, other than look for local LGBTQ groups in your area. They have a wealth of information. Just google ""LGBTQ groups in my area (or put in your city)"".

Don't delude yourself that its anything other than that. Taking pleasure in killing something, that's what is twisted. Don't even attempt to compare some ""poor African man"" with the idiots who kill for ""sport"". Not even the same thing. And yes, eating meat is twisted, but for some people necessary. I do't believe that putting the money back in the economy, raised by killing big game animals, is either necessary nor ethical. If they didn't kill them in the first place, there'd be no need for the conservation."

unpopularopinion,fektqmy,t1_fejga3g,1579207417.0,"Look, just because you can be outraged over animals being tortured, does not mean that you can't also be outraged over people being hurt. It's not a contest. And people may seem more outraged because animals need a voice. They cannot stand up for themselves. People can. And those that can't have plenty of advocates, not to mention it's common sense to be outraged for people."

unpopularopinion,fekszgn,t1_fejguve,1579206971.0,"I disagree. Animals have been domesticated through the efforts of people. It's our responsibility to make sure they're safe. And I will swerve around one. And they should have equal rights to people. Every living creature has the right to exist. And unfortunately when animals are killed, it's in the most horrific manner. People are murdered, sure, but not at the rate animals are. It's our responsibility as caring humans to protect them."

I will admit that I'm an insane animal lover, and it both breaks my heart and makes me angry that people get away with this. Even if you don't like animals, there is a correlation between people that kill animals and go on to horrific crimes!"

unpopularopinion,fe9weep,t1_fdgqxnz,1578942041.0,"I'm not going to drive to a bike path, that would defeat the purpose. I'm amazed at just how inept you are as a driver, that you cant figure how to navigate around a vehicle that you claim is moving so slowly. And since that is a problem, you should give io driving since you're clearly so bad at it.  And who died and made you the exercise czar?

unpopularopinion,fe9uis2,t1_fdhc1h1,1578941572.0,"Cyclists do have respect for drivers. In case it has eluded your tiny mind, most cyclists are also motorists. So we do know both aspects. You're painting all cyclists with the same brush, and that's not accurate. Of course, there will always be that minority that are assholes. You should understand that. And you don't know me, so don't presume to know who or what I respect. But you can bet I don't respect a knuckle dagger like you."

I've been on the road and seen what you're talking about. I see the ignorant drivers losing their minds because they can't get where they want to go just that little bit faster. If you were actually honest with yourself, you'd realize that the hold up isn't that long. But because you think cyclists simply don't belong on the road, you'll never change your small little mind."

We signal turns, which is more than I can say for most motorists. I have seen a few as you say ""asshole bikers"" However, we are cyclists, not bikers. They ride motorcycles. But frankly, judging from your attitude, you're the one that brings out the worst in cyclists. You're the guy that makes people want to screw up traffic for you. Maybe if you just were patient for 5 seconds, and went around the cyclist, they wouldn't be such a dick to you."

I always stay as far to the right as I can. Technically I may ride in the center of the lane, but because I don't want to mess up traffic, I stay to the right. How about motorists that don't give the required 3 feet? Just because you can't get somewhere 2 minutes faster does not give you more rights than I have."

How about the ""selfish pricks"" who think it's funny to try to knock cyclists off their bikes? Or how about the assholes who throw stuff them?
