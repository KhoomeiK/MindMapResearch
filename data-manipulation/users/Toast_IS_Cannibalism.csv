SkincareAddiction,fef13o1,t1_feemmi0,1579045700.0,Agreed- target employee that does beg to differ. Our inventory is wack half the time.
perfectloops,fecjh9k,t1_fecifni,1578975409.0,Yeah they’re just stalling some hippo ballerinas. Just watch out for the elephants and ostriches.
Twins,fdnrswl,t1_fdmp250,1578591539.0,"I absolutely agree with doing at least one session with the twin’s therapist- just so you can see what the therapist is like and so they can see the bigger picture of the relationship between OP and her twin.

My twin and I definitely went through rough spots when we both started dating. We’ve learned that we both want time with out SO’s, but also need time with just us two. We have to plan ahead by a week or two ahead because of work schedules but at we at least spend time with just us two couple times a month- and we live together!"
NatureIsFuckingLit,fdne05k,t1_fdmxr5l,1578583784.0,"It depends on the tribe from what I’ve learned. My grandfather had some Sami cousins in Norway - the older ones and some of the younger generation still have herds of their own. They have permanent modern homes, but will set up camp each spring for the culling and marking fawns (which is pretty neat- every one has their own triangular pattern notched into the ear of the reindeer)."
Twins,fdm7uxd,t3_em2zat,1578541958.0,"My (identical) twin and I have actually had 2 separate conversations about this over a couple years. We both cried at the thought and it was hard, but it 1) brought us closer together 2) we gave ourselves an individual goal to pursue Incase one of use died to work through the grief.

I find the idea of pushing away my twin just to spare myself pain for if/when they die so much worse and almost selfish. You’re taking away time from your twin without giving them a choice about it. That could be years or decades of pulling away and I find that absolutely torturous.

I’d rather have years/decades of memories with my twin to help with the grief than the overwhelming guilt I would have for pulling away."
cats,fdjpgti,t1_fdj86as,1578482224.0,"I’m not leaving it up to fate to determine if my cat suffers. I’ve seen what my parents belief did and keep my Cecil inside with all the toys, cat nip, and play time  that he can take.

May fate treat your furry one better once you let her outside again."
cats,fdj4fhx,t1_fdj1wx6,1578458165.0,"Please consider other options. I grew up in a very quiet suburb with a woodland not far away. 

Our oldest cat disappeared for weeks and came back with a huge gash that got gangrene. The vet was shocked he made it but he lost half his weight and never fully recovered. RIP Smokey

One of my earliest memories was seeing one of the family cats dead in the driveway because we was hit by a car in the street but crawled his was as close to home as he could. He never made it and was cold by the time we found him. RIP Jingles.

We had another family cat that was shot by the neighbors boys with BB guns- one got him in the eye and he eventually died from complications from it. RIP Sunny

The boys parents apologized but the damage was done. Just because you’re neighbors know your cat, it won’t stop stupid and dumb kids (or drivers in your case) from accidentally or deliberately hurting your cat. Or from fleas, ticks, raccoons, opossums, infections, and other harmful things. Nature is amazing, but it is also harsh.

Stop seeing the outdoors as the best option to make your pets life fulfilling- because more than likely something else’s will happen. Don’t waste the time and love you give your cat just to have it harmed while it’s outdoors.please, please take this from someone that had to seen very loved cats suffer because my family had the same thought that the outdoors was a good place for our cats. Learn from this."
science,fdih0ky,t1_fdierk7,1578442716.0,Well that’s explains how I lost my childhood allergies but my lactose intolerance got worse.
AmItheAsshole,fdh3wqt,t1_fdh1cq2,1578414836.0,My parents never had to yell at me or my siblings because they knew how to discipline and raise us kids so it never got to that point. Just because it’s common to yell doesn’t mean it’s not bad parenting .
Cinderblock,fcve0v4,t1_fcvcmdr,1578000134.0,Yup- someone was posting the vids from Instagram without consent from the vet.
entitledparents,fcjwyf6,t1_fcjptd2,1577708668.0,I have the same name as a hurricane- that was a fun couple of years in middle school. And then another one his that was the same as my twins. We’re the hurricane twins now among our friends and we learned to embrace it.

unpopularopinion,fc2slsc,t1_fc2pb2d,1577372835.0,My 2017 car doesn’t. And neither does my sister’s 2016 car. I’m assuming it’s only certain manufacturers and/or certain models that has this mysterious dial.
childfree,fbchg6w,t1_fbc1vcm,1576723986.0,I mean my family gave us kids a small piece of a cake on our first birthday and we all smooshed it to hell- this would’ve been late 80’s early 90’s. And now most of my siblings do it with their kids. Not sure how it all started or how it scaled up to a whole cake.
