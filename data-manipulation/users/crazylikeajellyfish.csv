With that in mind, it's really meant to be a UI -- the usage is going through menus and making choices, not scripting.

Once you're in UI world, JS is the bomb.  I find React to be very convenient for reasoning about state; this was my chance to try using it with Ink, the command line renderer.  There's an ecosystem of reusable components, so I never did any math to work out how to make a fully aligned and indented table.  When I needed to display the size of a file, there was an easy library to pretty-format the bytecount in the appropriate denominator.  Have you used moment.js before?

alcoholism,ff3izvc,t1_ff2ouao,1579542065.0,"Honestly, it's painful, but you can't keep acting with his well-being in mind.  He's a danger to you, that comes first.

If you're the only thing keeping him from going off the rails with his drinking, then he needs to go off the rails to understand that.  Allowing the addict to experience consequences (e.g. you acting on how he makes you feel, wanting to leave) is one of the best things you can do for them.

Plenty of addicts talk about losing the people around them as a key turning point which led them to go sober.  Alcoholism is even partly defined by it creating issues in your relationships.  Walking out on him is the clearest way to communicate those issues.

What you'd really be doing is setting up boundaries; you love him, but you can't be with him if he doesn't go sober.  The boundaries are gates, not walls -- you'd love to be with him, but only on your side of the boundary.  That boundary is the distance at which you can love both them and yourself.

Good luck, OP, I hope you get somewhere safe & positive soon <3"
LifeProTips,femnw1s,t1_felwnn3,1579264124.0,"Right, but at least with the government, we can force those excessive receipts to see the light of day. We can push our legislators to create oversight measures for eliminating waste. Military contractors charge whatever they want because, as a nation, we never want the smaller gun. Medicare, on the other hand, negotiates a rate lower than many insurance companies.

You hit the nail on the head. Any system of pooling money to administer a service is ripe for graft. The question is where can we fight that graft more effectively. In private markets where scale reigns and competition is nominal, those companies are basically unaccountable to anyone other than shareholders.

There's a wide set of applications where private markets create enough competitive entities that we get better results than using one big entity. But in the markets where that isn't the case, like healthcare, I think it's important for that entity to be structurally accountable to everyone."

My take is that at the same time, our brains are small little corners of the universe, dramatically affected by what surrounds them.  Our brains don't have control over most things in the universe, and at least consciously, not even over most of what's happening with our bodies.

My ""higher power"" is the abstract premise of other people, social connection.  The people I connect and surround myself with influence me in a way that I know I'm not fully conscious of, or have control over.  When you're part of something bigger than yourself, that affects the core of you.  People can lend you strength when you feel you don't have any, and at the end of the day, that's most of what the rule is there for.

You will see some kind of payout in a liquidation event, the company is bound by contract. Your mileage may vary though.

If the company over-raises and the final liquidity can't match the paper value, the company is often contractually obligated to pay out investors first.  I'm pretty certain there are scenarios where employee options end up not paying out.  Right now, for instance, they've raised $150M and their revenue is $14M -- a more than 10x multiple, which is pretty high.  The company's growth might be such that it adds up, but over-raising is a very real issue."

More often, though, understanding the math (esp algorithmic complexity) gives you an intuitive grasp of ""good"" or ""bad"" ways to implement something.
