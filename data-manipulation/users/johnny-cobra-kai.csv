So she made them in a way where you didn’t know they were in there. That might be an effort towards working with your aversion. Really though, she should’ve just made a different vegetable. But if you’re gonna sleep on the couch every time your wife does something annoying and pout until she apologizes, you’re gonna have a hard time in life."
entitledparents,ffd52oz,t3_esyrqo,1579813576.0,"What’s so annoying about this is that you giving away free Christmas cards is so generous, and she has the nerve to be rude. Talk about r/choosingbeggars"
ChoosingBeggars,ffd4t5p,t3_esysgm,1579813427.0,I wonder if charging for it would work so that when they ask for it for free he can just say “ok” and then they’ll feel like they won
AmItheAsshole,ffcw4s7,t3_eswgm7,1579808504.0,"NAH, but do you really want to spend the rest of your life like this? Not being able to take the kids to Disneyland or go to a nice restaurant on your anniversary? There are so many people out there in the world, why tie yourself down to someone who has such serious problems? It may seem a bit callous, but if you settle in your relationship for something like this, you may not be happy in the long run."
AskReddit,ffcp62a,t1_ffcowwh,1579804237.0,Tbh I think it’s only men that mistake politeness for flirting. Maybe they’re not used to girls being nice to them or something
AskReddit,ffco3e2,t1_ffcbm8q,1579803582.0,Thank you! It’s nice to know someone gets how it is.
AskReddit,ffcar51,t1_ffcakpz,1579795387.0,"I suppose I could talk to my sister. It’s kind of hard because I live with my dad and he means well, but he doesn’t understand anxiety at all. So I’m kind of embarrassed to talk about it. I’d sort of like to go to therapy so I’m not relying on medication forever, but I’m ashamed to admit it. I know I shouldn’t be, but I am."
AskReddit,ffc9rdr,t1_ffbpxcx,1579794765.0,"Thank you. It’s actually very well under control, but I worry it’ll become not under control again"
AskReddit,ffbdho4,t3_esokzr,1579760707.0,Is my anxiety coming back?
AskReddit,ffb7kr1,t1_ffb2lo8,1579754036.0,Oh yeah thank you. I forgot about that one

NoStupidQuestions,ffamc3d,t3_eskc3m,1579739309.0,"I don’t know if this has been suggested yet, but have you considered not doing this challenge?"
AmItheAsshole,ffadd45,t1_ffacwz3,1579732894.0,"Oh come on. Everyone on reddit hates their parents I know, but it’s just one well meaning comment that turned out to be rude. This whole thing where people say parents are toxic and you should cut them off just bc they’re not perfect is absurd."
LifeProTips,ffaatzb,t3_esijtt,1579731270.0,"Another way to do it is to not even look at the coin, just sit for a minute and ask yourself what result you’re hoping for. But if you still don’t know then you might as well go for it"
AskReddit,ffaaj9d,t1_ffa9ig4,1579731097.0,Calling someone a dick is still an insult
LifeProTips,ffaacht,t3_esiw3v,1579730990.0,This is fucking brilliant. Thank you

AmItheAsshole,ff9zzu2,t3_esgzvt,1579725114.0,Why would he not talk to you for days? Even if you could’ve focused on being extra safe instead of implying that his girlfriend was lying. Is that such a big deal? I don’t understand not talking to your family member just because they accidentally hurt your feelings. Just for that I’m saying NTA
