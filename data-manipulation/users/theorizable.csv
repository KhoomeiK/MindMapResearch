MurderedByWords,ffdade4,t1_ffcyuwi,1579816580.0,I thought they're only allowed to do this if you're part-time. My job has unpaid lunch... but you work 9-6 to get the full 40 hours a week.
MurderedByWords,ffclzqy,t3_esudjt,1579802291.0,Everytime I hear Jeanine Pirro's voice I think there's nothing worse in the world... then I listen to her arguments and stand corrected.
LifeProTips,ffcl26w,t3_eslhhj,1579801731.0,"You won't be able to see the story if they're good developers. If they're sending the entire story from the server then hiding it using the DOM, they're not good developers. OR they're developers who are trying to save time in development."
LifeProTips,ffbi9pe,t3_esjcpo,1579766550.0,"Thank god privacy laws and tech laws are catching up to tech giants. They fucking got away with shit for so long. Like, it should be common fucking sense that you know if a tech company is selling your data to another company. Same with online subscriptions as listed here."

webdev,ff89ajp,t3_es5lbi,1579669784.0,"Yikes... I'm in LA and it's hard enough. The bay area is a whole different monster. They recruit top of class graduates from MIT, not 3 project free-lancers. I was in the same boat as you and I got lucky with an internship for a startup that turned into a job. I'm at 1.5 years now and I'm going to hop to a bigger company soon, but I'm not expecting anything more than a slightly larger startup, haha."

webdev,ff1xk5m,t3_er5flw,1579488463.0,"Oh god... estimates. Once you get the hang of it, figure out what they're looking for and estimate your hours needed for completion. You can even break this down for them in the estimate so they know what they could possibly cut. Then the hourly rate multiplier. This is how I'd go about it. It's how my company goes about it as well."
facepalm,ff1x1m2,t3_er4tzb,1579488132.0,"I've heard people say that they're ""pro-life"", they just think people should be able to choose whether or not to get an abortion. Facebook... what a place."

trashy,feblnx4,t3_eo9il7,1578960070.0,I was going to comment on a different post like this... it's really fucking weird that when kids are mean to each other it's bullying but when adults do it to kids it's called teasing. It's just incredible. Kids look up to you like you're a superhero. Doing this shit to them could give them serious psychological damage.
relationship_advice,febhizs,t1_feb5wla,1578958823.0,I think that's good advice. It wouldn't make sense for her to be planning all this stuff w/ me if she wasn't at least a little bit interested.
