therewasanattempt,ffgkkcv,t3_etdg3o,1579908367.0,People never read the article before dunking on it. Even the headline says absolutely nothing that could be construed as an attack on white men
Damnthatsinteresting,ffffjif,t3_et8awf,1579882858.0,"There are no one size fits all catchphrases for business schmoozing. You'll come off as boorish and rude if you act this way when it's not necessary. Know which situation calls for which mindset. If the person I'm working with is nitpicky or domineering, I might use these to avoid being steamrolled. If they're just a normal, reasonable person, it's better to show a little humanity. You usually know the difference within a few minutes of meeting someone"
PublicFreakout,ff8mog0,t3_es2z99,1579686170.0,I would not let anyone hold a piece of paper worth millions of dollars. When he was trying to take it back she didn't want to let go
ThatsInsane,ff8ly66,t3_ervt12,1579685035.0,Watching these things eat is traumatic
BeAmazed,ff8lsmk,t1_ff7nt3u,1579684798.0,Predictable.
therewasanattempt,feg619a,t3_eow08o,1579078601.0,"When people say 'it's the principle' they're just making a lame excuse to be a douche over a minor inconvenience. This lady doesn't even tip her server, and here she is on Facebook talking about principles lol"
aww,fe6aw7z,t3_encuj1,1578885765.0,I can't tell if they have platypus noses or pig noses. Very cute either way
therewasanattempt,fe05qow,t3_ena1me,1578803723.0,This person probably isn't a parent. It doesn't say anywhere that they have kids.
UnethicalLifeProTips,fdp2w4r,t3_emewsq,1578618707.0,"If this doesn't work on your phone, there are apps that can directly change your phone's call log. Look for 'call log editor'. Some phones won't even attempt a call when on airplane mode"
TwoXChromosomes,fdg2rs7,t3_el6tbb,1578377873.0,Because they would rather see an entire continent go up in flames that see a woman sell photos of her own body. Lol. People are so absurdly backwards

facepalm,fctrlpr,t3_eijxzr,1577955878.0,No way is this comment about programming. What he said makes no sense in that context. This is either fake or low-effort rage baiting
trashy,fcozxxs,t3_ei7261,1577846275.0,I don't get what's wrong with peacefully sitting in an empty parking lot. I know people who do this for various reasons and most of them have been harassed by cops at one point or another. Just stirring up shit and hoping to catch someone with drugs I guess
unpopularopinion,fccyomg,t3_egvyp2,1577604236.0,I'm trying to imagine the taste but I can't. I guess Ill have to eat it now
maybemaybemaybe,fcc0k6p,t3_egovfj,1577593049.0,"This isn't cute, this is obnoxious. Cops shouldn't be pulling people over unless they have a good reason. If they think they actually improved this lady's day by scaring the shit out of her and then giving her some cheap ice cream they're kidding themselves"
