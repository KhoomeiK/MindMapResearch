MetalCasting,ffa67ku,t1_ffa3jzb,1579728670.0,"Aluminum casts really well and lots of people start with it. I'd still start out with resin or pewter or that sort of thing to wrap your head around the process of casting in a less dangerous (and easier to observe) environment, but that's me. Seriously, watch your feet and know where you'll put the metal if you start to burn.

On the soda can front, do it with some clean aluminum first and get an idea of how it's supposed to work. Cans are super dirty and produce a ton of dross etc. That's not really a bad problem once you've got things figured out but may disappoint the first time. If you do start with cans, get a *lot* of them-- most of the melt will be dross and cans don't have a lot of material to start with.

Regarding greensand vs petrobond, they're basically the same process just different materials. You also may have the option of water glass casting, which is a similar technique that I find has less to go wrong with it than trying to DIY greensand for infrequent use.

I would still recommend investment casting overall for your first time."
MetalCasting,ffa2c13,t3_esgjag,1579726480.0,"If you've never cast anything before, I would recommend starting with plaster and alginate. It isn't as exciting, but then it doesn't kill you no matter how badly you fuck it up (within reason). You can get started cheaply and learn the absolute basics of moldmaking and material handling without taking any real risk at all.

After that I would go with investment cast pewter. It will still burn you badly if you screw up, but you'll be basically familiar with how plaster works by that point and you'll be getting technique down that transfers well to aluminum and bronze without so much of the cost.

Once you've done that, I would use the same techniques for aluminum and bronze.

Why not greensand? Basically, greensand is really fast in terms of calendar time and really cheap over a lot of pieces. Investment casting is neither. However, the learning curve on investment casting is much less steep and, in my experience, fast and cheap enough that if you're sweating that cost you should probably stare hard at the price of metal these days.

Just my two cents."

In the summer wine racks are popular and just dead easy to make in any theme you want. Beer bottle openers too. Similar things like guitar hooks sell well at music festivals. I've cast stuff for ren faires that sold for way too much, but they're hard to get a booth at. Dinosaurs and rocketships and such sell well at science-themed events.

MetalCasting,fehcnoa,t1_feharf9,1579113822.0,"If you need the ramp, get a nice new controller like that one and an old kiln and learn how to use them. IIRC that one is only like $80, so between that, the relay, temperature probe, and outlet you're looking at like $150 or $175. You can probably find a kiln for that much as well and be out $350 all in, and have something that does exactly what you want with some learning on your part.

If you don't need the ability to ramp you will still need the ability to check the temperature, which will cost you about $50 on top of the kiln so bear that in mind.

I would not buy the integrated one unless your time is insanely valuable, your money is insanely plentiful, or this is a day job for you and you have customers waiting. If any of those is true, I would do some work to make sure your setup as a whole-- from concept to completed object-- fits together and does everything you need right away.

Regarding the controller, here's the thing: a kiln is literally just a bunch of nichrome wire in a big insulated box. You apply power, the wire gets hot, the box holds the heat. The controller is there to listen to your temperature probe and turn the power on and off at the right times to make your kiln the right temperature, but the kiln itself will ""work"" without it.

Newer and more expensive kilns come with that controller integrated in, so you just plug it into the wall and go. That's convenient, but it's quite a lot of upsell: my kiln was about $250 between the kiln itself and the replacement controller, but if I'd gotten a new one with the same capabilities I'd have added a zero to that easy.

Statistically, a black child is more likely to be fucked as hard as he was. But it's difficult to look at a specific life and see statistics rather than history, especially when it's your own.

Personally I think that's the problem with most interracial conversations about white privilege: it's a statistical effect where everyone will wind up on the less-likely side of it many times during their life. Unless everyone involved is very level headed and very numerate (speaking of statistically unlikely things...) at least a few of those times will feel like personal history to them rather than statistics. And from personal history to perceived counterpoint is a really short jump.

To me, the common ground is to focus on the fact that everybody gets fucked by things that aren't their fault, build common ground and empathy on that point, then go to the statistics and say that hey, racism exists and it's a problem we need to solve while we're addressing how people get fucked by things that aren't their fault.

nextfuckinglevel,fegvk9k,t1_fegqtg7,1579103500.0,"So, there's a slight difference between what you're saying here.

It is technically possible to receive the best medical care in the world in America.

However, Americans overall receive worse medical outcomes than people in countries like Canada, UK, Norway, Sweden, Japan, etc. In fact, we are no longer in the top ten globally for health outcomes, and we have the highest rate of medically amenable deaths-- meaning, deaths caused by issues that can be medically addressed-- among wealthy nations.

We also spend more to get those health outcomes. Average, median, and overall health costs in the US are higher than in the above countries as well. The gap in average costs is especially large and problematic.

Once upon a time, the statement that ""the US has the best healthcare in the world"" was both broadly true and a justifiable point of pride for the nation. Today it is a technicality that rings of hollow and insular jingoism. Claiming we have the best will get a bad reaction from the rest of the world as much for that impression as for the facts that undermine it."

Build quality is good, neck is nice but not wide enough to my tastes, intonation is good, tuning isn't super stable but it's once a day not once a song, strings are normal and thus easy to come by. I switched to half rounds a while back, other than that normal strings which is nice for the travel guitars. It's certainly an attractive guitar, and people start conversations when they see it. 

The amp has presets that supposedly embrace clean playing, punk, rock, and metal. Those are, to put it mildly, ambitious descriptions of an unexciting amplifier.

funny,fec4pir,t1_febxrwn,1578966614.0,"Unless you have something with a bend in it. I just tested the file on toenail clippers and it works well on an identical setup. With some lean you could probably do the same with a coathangar or the wire from the toilet's flapper valve, maybe the pushrod for the sink drain if it's not too fancy, or a wire shower curtain hook.

It also means he could have pulled the hinge pins, which would probably take some hand strength unless he had something like the toenail clippers or could wrap the chain from the toilet flapper valve around the top. Newer flat topped pins make that more challenging, but with such a light door any tolerance in the hinges themselves would have been easy to get soapy water into to ease removal.

And it seems the screws on the doorknob are on the wrong side anyway. Obviously not something he could correct in the moment, but probably a good mistake not to make on your other doors-- having your locks disassemble from the outside isn't always a good thing."

BoneAppleTea,fe9zf4p,t1_fe9fqj6,1578942811.0,"So, not to throw rocks here, but gravity waves don't prove Newtonian gravity.

Newton wasn't able to observe scales large enough or events fast enough to see that gravity wasn't felt everywhere instantaneously. As far as he was able to tell, if something a million billion trillion miles away moved an inch, you would experience a tiny tiny tiny change in your weight right away.

Einstein was the one who understood that the speed of light is as fast as anything, even the effects of gravity, can travel. This leads to the idea of gravity waves, which are what we observed a few years ago.

The sticky wicket is that this is why both are theories: they are models which predict within experimental error everything we've observed so far, but can't be ""proven"" in the sense of being reducable to a tautology or empirically verified to be without error. All we can really say is that our observations support the theory extraordinarily well. That sucks because people who have never actually proven anything don't understand how different the sense of the word is from the courtroom notion of a proof, but... chalk it up to observable error, I guess."

If you stick with it you can do it, but be prepared for it to be a long road. It can be painful, and I'd advise not to play through intense pain on your fretting hand. Pain when strumming you can play through. Give it a long time, and be aware that any changes in the shape of your hands or hand musculature can impact what feels comfortable for you to play-- I like much wider, flatter necks than I used to, for example."
