So school yourself and the other Christians in your life and use the gifts God gave you.

In terms of psychic thought, astrological thought, when we are 28 years old, we start what is called Saturn Return. It is a time for us to choose our true path in life. So you might think about what you really want to do and not concern yourself with others right now. You should ask about this on the astrology subreddit.

I wish you well.

Parkinsons,ffu57un,t1_ff8hl4i,1580234749.0,"To Canadian beavver (on mobile and Reddit didn't show me your entire comment)... When I wrote best care, I was thinking of the end stage. My best friend died of PD but was not able to afford the nursing care she needed in the end. It would have been better if she had. I think Ozzy has the resources to pass with more dignity than my friend. That's all."
Mediums,ffu4jtw,t1_ffs7cuq,1580234344.0,"The first Voice was an angel and I believe it came to open and convince me of the phenomena. I continued to hear from this Voice, but while my guide was specifically my channel, the angel is universal and speaks to many, many others."
Mediums,ffs7cuq,t1_ffrqn3y,1580174937.0,"Yes. I have a number of ways to ground myself. Number one is listening to my guide when he says 'That's enough.' That way my energy doesn't run away with me. But I also like water, walking, and meditation and visualization."
Psychic,ffrpnet,t3_eusmwm,1580163034.0,"I understand how you feel. If there is a spiritualist church in your town, visit to see how it feels. You might find lots of kindred spirits there.

Mediums,ffrl2kv,t3_euu10q,1580160238.0,"I had a rather phenomenal awakening one night in which a Voice began to communicate telepathically. There was a second voice who identified himself by name. From then on I felt the presence of this second guide and began to channel him during my readings. My ability continued to unfold over the years. I am a conscious trance medium, meaning I read from a light trance state, knowing and remembering all that's said during a reading. I love it."
Psychic,ffp0zxc,t3_eu9rsb,1580084110.0,"This is such an old argument - to charge money or not.

To OP, what I've seen in this sub is free, exchange and donation based readings offered. I don't see any posts that outright charge a specific fee. So that's the kind of space this is.

 I think no matter what you do in life, you have the right to charge for your time. I spent 30 years doing readings and I had a set charge. My clientele were mostly repeat and word-of-mouth referrals.

Now I'm retired and I do the occasional reading for free.

But I don't accept any arguments about whether either charging or free is superior. I don't think anyone needs to justify their position on this. It's your Work, charge or don't, it's your choice.

Psychic,ffot590,t3_euctbd,1580081427.0,"If you can get therapy, do it now. Right now.

It's useless to leave your body if you hate yourself that much. The hate will be with you wherever you go, physically, astrally, spiritually. You need to work this out on a solid psychological basis, the sooner the better.

Meantime, I don't think your soul can leave your body for good, so study up on OBEs and astral projection and take this as a learning experience.

Good luck

Psychic,ffnk5np,t1_ffm7b1v,1580067043.0,"Then I guess self defense is your option. But don't forget you can couple that with the power of the ultimate Spirit - God, or whatever you identify as God. I will be thinking of you and trying to send helpful energy as well.

Mediums,ffkyg1d,t3_eu07og,1580031307.0,"As a medium myself, I would say it is mostly spirits with unsettled tragedies that seek us out. They're stuck. Who else can they really turn to? I was recently approached by someone in spirit who in life had been highly rational. He was so confused. 

Good and talented mediums are beacons in the dark for all kinds of spirits. 

As to connecting the dots months later, sometimes it takes years.

Keep up the good work!

Mediums,ffktld6,t1_ffjo4my,1580028632.0,"Very interesting. I don't know much about this tradition, but drumming makes sense for evoking trance work."
Psychic,ffjh685,t3_etyeky,1579998142.0,"To a large degree, your experience is very normal so far as the material success goes. I've seen memes that illustrate success like an ice berg. People only see the top bit that is your success, and not the bottom 90% that is hard work, struggle, fails and disappointments.  Most people will never see the real you or your effort. That really is ' just the way it is'.

If you think people are looking down on you, I think that's leftover toxic conditioning from your parents. As I say, very few people will ever see the real you. I would only try to share if someone really important to you comes along.

As to your trouble with entities, a good psychic, shamanic soul is like a torch in the darkness and will draw all kinds of spirits.  I feel I've always been protected by my guides from unwanted contacts. So if I were you, I'd ask my guides for protection. 

I feel you could also manifest your own protection in the form of barriers of energy. You could declare yourself only available for 1/2 - 1 hour a day to clear spirits that need clearing, and you're not dealing with malicious energy at all. I believe you could do this.

Parkinsons,ffj3ddk,t3_etuy3l,1579989360.0,"My friend had Parkinson's and her husband was her sole caregiver until I moved into her town. After that I would show up a couple times a week to take her out for the day in order to give him time off. But perhaps due to age, your parents don't have any friends that could do this. Are there any other family members able to help?

Aside from hiring someone to come in to assist, going to a day facility or checking into a nursing or rehab facility for a few days at a time, I can't think of anything else.

Maybe it's time for tough love. You all sit down together and tell Dad that Mum is going to break down if she can't get some help, and then he'll have no choice about going into nursing care. So it might be better if he took advantage of some day programs now to avoid that, for both his and Mum's sake. Honestly, he's the selfish one here. Time to face reality.

I'm sorry your family is in this position. PD is lousy.

Are there any caregiver or PD support groups in your area? Or is there a PD association of some kind to call? They might have more ideas or resources to suggest.

Good luck!"
Psychic,ffdh5sm,t3_et0u99,1579820767.0,"I keep thinking about and I really think you experienced a physical event, like sleeping on a nerve combined with a change in air pressure, which can cause ringing in the ears and blood pressure anomalies. I don't feel any spirit involvement. Hope you are feeling fine now.

Psychic,ffdg0j6,t3_esyup7,1579820095.0,"I believe everyone has at least a bit of pshic ability. I think it's a form of intelligence.

It's a thin line between being highly aware and being psychic, if you ask me. If I were to advise you, I would suggest keeping a record of these incidents, and using whatever you 'hear' for your own advantage.

I know that discovering the reality of the paranormal in our so-called rational world is intimidating. I was a professional psychic, and 20 years in I was still wondering if I was crazy or if this shit was real. Spoiler: shit's real.

I wish I could convince you to not be afraid. You do not have to tell anyone about your ability and experience. You can just watch it, so to say. Again, use it to your own advantage, or however you feel moved.

You're going to be all right.

Your Dad is dying. It's time to sit and rest, and talk and love. There is no use in pushing any more therapeutic exercises. It's time to rest, ask him about (and recored) his life story, messages and wisdom.

I'm sorry you are both going through this. PD is  cruel. But this is the best way to end. Pain management, closeness, and closure.
