Even if it means doing nothing just lying in bed, it takes a while for the brain to stop hurting itself. Some days I feel like I'm gonna burst, yet people don't appreciate how good it is to have your own bed and just a bit less stress that could be from doing anything really, even just talking to people. Its not anything with you. Also another thing to note meds may take a couple to a few weeks to kick in, but even after that the brain needs a couple more weeks to recuperate. Some people may take time to get ready for therapy, because if you go when your mood is bad or something else it may further aggravate the feelings of hopelessness.  I suggest you continue doing therapy for yourself, and wait for a better time for the other. If you persist too much on forcing the therapy on them its not helping anyone. Like I was saying, give it time. And hopefully they see therapy as something that can work. If not they might take something else up and that might be therapy in of itself.
