toronto,ffc2ed6,t1_ffazjim,1579789827.0,It is/used to be similar going through Montreal. 140kph to everyone slams on their brakes with a rolling restart back up to 140kph.
toronto,ff88jde,t3_es6m33,1579669111.0,"This actually happened to me on a flight from Vienna to Toronto. Those beans are horrible and I was sitting next to my coworker and she asked how they were. I replied, ""better without the pebble but still disgusting"". Shoot I could have got a $100 voucher."

funny,ff870xt,t1_ff7rlgy,1579667806.0,"Lol so this is one of my favourite things to work on. Our naughty list is something like 25,000 words/phrases now because humans just keep getting better at writing insults into input. I had a to do a presentation to a vendor because they literally had no vulgar list."
Torontobluejays,ff7xfbc,t3_eqs77s,1579660645.0,Serious conversation here - I don't know if it is that safe this early. If you're like me and only buy a jersey every few years you'd want a name that's still around or that made a major impact to the team. If you collect jerseys then shit get both. Since the new look I went with a blank jersey and then got an Eddie and a Stroman. At least to me those names I'll always associate with the Blue Jays. It's all personal choice but I figure I'd add my 2 cents beyond you should be good with either.
Torontobluejays,ff7wfqe,t1_ff1yei8,1579659978.0,I only ever get front row from StubHub now after they punted my sales rep.
Torontobluejays,ff7w833,t3_equ9e1,1579659833.0,Hope this means we still get TVs in the 100s outfield. The guys sitting up in the bullpen often turn around to look at them. Although a privacy screen would fix that.
Torontobluejays,feiw7fp,t3_ep51k7,1579148885.0,We trade for Ken Giles again
Torontobluejays,fefrcti,t1_fef1j0v,1579062968.0,Superstitious = baseball. Just ask the magical bat I saved from a creek that destroys softballs. (Actual true story)
Torontobluejays,fedejcj,t1_fcv2ioc,1579009330.0,Mine was Stone Temple Pilots opening for the Rolling Stones. I can just barely remember my first game there in 1987 with my dad.
funny,fdo75cw,t1_fdnbnzg,1578600059.0,4 weeks late to the party? I had a border collie X that knew she was looking at herself. First time in front of a floor mirror she lifted her left paw and then watched herself lick her own paw. Never paid attention to a mirror ever again. My shelties before her always growled at mirrors and they weren't dumb dogs. The border collie X  also understood about 400 words so she was a special dog.
videos,fctlgw4,t3_eik5jj,1577947694.0,"This is literally the most real thing I've seen on the internet in years. Even if this is a lie it's still an insane amount of effort. Respectfully, I respect this regardless. Well done."
todayilearned,fcsmdx9,t1_fcoo2lh,1577919636.0,Yes definitely possible in 2007. Basement apartments were around that money per month. Missed the 2007 part. I was paying like $500 sharing a three bedroom in 2007.
todayilearned,fcsm9gp,t1_fcoxkj7,1577919553.0,I was near Dundas and Bathurst in 2007 and was paying about $500/month sharing a three bedroom. You could get a basement back then for around $800 so makes total sense. Missed the 2007 part.
todayilearned,fcohcy4,t1_fcof5oo,1577832253.0,Yeah I guess as a portion that works. I got in around $1500 and now they are asking $2400 for my 1980s building. Same floor plan
IAmA,fcobwzb,t1_fcobegl,1577828481.0,Should have said I'm Canadian. Sure I get killed in income taxes but I don't have to worry about going bankrupt to live. Watch out for PTSD type stuff and glad you made it back from the brink.
todayilearned,fcob6r2,t1_fco93bs,1577827972.0,The better question is where can you rent in Toronto for $830? I'd let them keep the $10 change for that rent.
IAmA,fcoaywq,t1_fcnlv5j,1577827820.0,So what roughly did that cost you or your family out of pocket? I hear my coworkers in Texas have $3000 deductibles just for insurance coverage. One co-worker is going to be out of pocket $25K for a heart procedure after insurance. I can't imagine you were fully covered for that long.
IAmA,fcnlmaf,t3_ehym96,1577813860.0,Are you American? Who paid for all of that care? What did it cost? I've always wondered how anyone in the US could afford to survive that long. Legit question if you're in the US.
toronto,fckj5oi,t1_fckeqdp,1577726481.0,No it was on Queens Quay at a condo. Brain fart when I wrote Lakeshore. We did a lot of the waterfront installations/planning when I worked for that firm (Architects Alliance). They never built it. The two owners hated this guys work and dumped the guy on me in Jordan where he was an even bigger tool.
todayilearned,fcjb739,t3_ehc97y,1577681922.0,Meh. My dead mother would have watched it and I can say that with no humour/sarcasm.
toronto,fcjas81,t1_fcj9k6d,1577681592.0,Hmm.. what's the opposite of obsessed? That's me. I guess they share plane of existence to be fair. Edit: man bun
toronto,fcj9e2i,t1_fciutaq,1577680540.0,So you're a man-bun right?
toronto,fciqz5x,t1_fcimj1f,1577667730.0,"I once got in a huge argument at work with a coworker on the subject of people walk the most convenient path. He was one of those man-bun type architects before that was a thing. We went back and forth about no one is going to cross Lakeshore and then walk 30m left or right so his piece of architectural street art could be seen better. After like 30 minutes of arguing he finally says, ""I'll put a huge fucking rock right there so they have to walk around it""."
movies,fcbvtfe,t1_fc9pk4j,1577591525.0,I went to see it in surround sound too. It was the first real blockbuster shown in my home city in surround sound. Only 2 screens had the Dolby systems (maybe it was THX) and that also blew my mind.
toronto,fcbv3i0,t1_fcacoyt,1577591309.0,"You do because of the sheer volume you encounter living downtown. If you live downtown and let every asshole get to you it would drive you nuts. There's definitely a difference in terms of personal experience when you are constantly surrounded by people. OP's comment to her is something that would likely have ticked me off but I would have forgotten about it 5 minutes later. No harm, no foul, move on. That's one of the great things about living downtown."
Torontobluejays,fc6p9o5,t1_fc6lujg,1577486042.0,I wonder what their cut is? 20-30% I'm guessing. Crazy.
Torontobluejays,fc6p63f,t1_fc6lt7j,1577485971.0,They work for 7 peanuts and a half bottle of diet Dr. Pepper these days. Too many bloggers willing to do it for nothing.
movies,fc6oh0a,t1_fc5zar1,1577485474.0,No on Netflix. Like I got most of the story but it just didn't resonate with me. It looked cool but I didn't think it was anything special. I'm not saying it was bad though. I bet it would have looked great on a big screen.
movies,fc5k8yd,t1_fc5de7r,1577459856.0,Yeah so let me know what you think about Annihilation. I was bored watching that movie and I love the genre. I've made people watch Arrival because I think it's great. Annihilation... Ummm... I must have missed something so many people on Reddit saw that I didn't see. I think the book readers liked the movie. That's my guess.

pics,fc1xpuw,t1_fc1vhxk,1577332968.0,I'm not kidding here. Gasoline works great too if you're ever stuck. Keep away from flames of course.
Torontobluejays,fc1nxoq,t3_efgu38,1577324373.0,Let's have an actual conversation on this idea instead of jokes. I've often thought about it. Tellez isn't off the hook yet now that Eddie is signing in Chitown. It's not impossible if the price is right to pick up someone like Thames. Shaw is the better gamble but if we still need some pop and the price is right. It's not the worst idea in the world. More versatile than Smoakie and hit 25 dongers last year. I don't think this idea is as far-fetched as this sub would lead you to believe. Also I never really thought Eddie would be brought back but a boy can dream.
Torontobluejays,fc0ajth,t1_fbzvigu,1577285040.0,Sure cool. Worked well. Maybe 3 people read it and I was like oh fuck here we go again some dummy that needs to clarify a simple statement. You really felt the need to help clarify a buried comment that I wrote in like 3 seconds. Again zzz... Now go away
