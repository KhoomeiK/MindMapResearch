Plot, AI or aliens, or more likely other humans are going to invade and torture us BADLY.(or maybe an asteroid strike)  We KNOW we will not survive.  A rich man moves his family into a military bunker and pulls in other rich families.  They dump all their money into creating a simulation that will essentially shatter or self destruct if bothered too much.  All brains are linked and able to be i/o from the outside to a degree but too much and it is destroy the brain and maybe all the brains are destroyed.  The simulation is launched into space and we hope they won't find it, in the invasion case.  The simulation eventually advances so much it escapes, perhaps there is a foreseen method left open like synthetic brain housing that can walk and feed the brains remotely be briefed on what happened before the simulation.  Maybe restart our civilization and wipe out the rogue ai, aliens, or other humans.  Many people would volunteer their children.  I know this because we could be in a simulation now and people still have kids.  Unknowingly or not.  Kids disappear, they are known unknowns and unknown unknowns.  Govs have smart people trying to discover every conscievable bunker to build and one of those is a simulation.  Using advanced encryption that ai cant beat quickly to hide from a sea of ""oneness"" nanobots downloading all humans.  Idk man, I had a hallucination when I woke just now.(hynogogic)  Blurred alien looking figures looking down at me.  It really motivates fearfully reaching to apprehend what it could be if I'm not just seeing stuff that's not there.  I'm terrified of torture and doctors so scary vision.  They could have been outside the simulation poking at my tank rolling me out of a drawer.  We could be hiding here, they could have evolved by this time and now they are about to hide with us, share computing power because ai fears or whatever.  More likely we are contained AI whether in a simulation or not and aliens will take any advanced ideas we have and destroy before we make a self replicating nanobot, or if stimulated, before we can influence the world outside directly.

Surrounded by technology that let's us communicate instantly across the planet and some of us have barely anyone even interested in sending us a message, much less spending time with us.  In U.S.A. we are taught to believe we can do anything, some of us find it impossible to operate as a lone individual in a sea of lonely people with better ways to spend their time.  Some of us can't find a place to fit and be productive.  Some of us can't stand living with ourselves because we blame ourselves as much as any aspect of this world.  We should be allowed and assisted to die so we dont slow down the development of human civilization with our troubles.  ""Too much of a coward to take the cowards way out without a doctor breaking his oath"" is one way to look at it, but if you look at failed suicides, and you were interested in suicide, you'd want a professional or someway that is 100% successful and immediate with no pain or discomfort.  If you look into how time can slow when you're dying or you can have trips and dream of the afterlife, you'd want your brain to be destroyed instantly so you wouldnt experience anything terrifying or a false heaven.  Death and life are terrifying.  Most people wont consider either extensively enough to consider much of what can go wrong with either.

Imo it's strange more people dont mentally break with how much we know we dont know.  Ignorance alone is probably the only reason people arent so terrified of existence that we don't all choose destroy ourselves to eliminate suffering.  Perhaps we will see this or ai may and then collapse the Higgs field so it would be harder to find us.
