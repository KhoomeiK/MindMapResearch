SpaceXLounge,ffobmzi,t3_eu99qo,1580075975.0,"No, its gotta run its course, and lots of good people have  a lot of life effort invested in it. Starship is currently a bunch of test-to-destruction tanks and a crude hopper that flew a little and relanded.  And a lot of hopes and dreams and plans of smart and motivated people. But it's totally unproven.

Now maybe in a year or two, it will be a real thing, and if it performs to expectations then yes SLS is gonna look pretty wasteful and sad.

But until then, SLS is literally the best and most powerful rocket the US has, assuming it passes the green run and actually flys. FH cannot loft as much, it cannot get a capsule like Orion to lunar orbit.

SLS uses well tested, arguably dated technology to do the job and is not risky, so it's a solid bet for an organisation like NASA. Yes it's hugely expensive, maye unjustifiably so, but all rockets have been wasteful and expensive until SpaceX started pushing the boundaries.  SpaceX haven't pushed this boundary YET, so SLS lives on."

Seeing something is not the same as doing it.

Simply knowing what someone will do isn't the same as making them do it. For instance, I can read a detailed history of events, but other people made choices that lead to those events.  My reading it has no bearing on what they did, no matter how detailed the history I can not change their choices in any way, nor do I have to agree with their choices at all to be able to see the final outcome. At any instant they may have chosen differently, then the history would be different. There would still be a history of some sort regardless.

God may see all events that ever did or ever will occur in the same way, it's still not the same as actually doing them.
