Researching randomly, it looks like schools with programs that interest him and might be within reach all accept IB, though awarded credits is different.

The stress for him is a thing to balance. To hear kids in IB struggle like it's a regular occurrence concerns me.  We don't want to go down a road that we were on with him three years ago. He puts a ton of pressure on himself and we want him to do what he wants, but for him we need to take the reins to prioritize balance so he's not burning out at 16 years old.

Our oldest graduated school in NY and we moved, now we are in a state with decent education but still lesser than NY's by what people say (we actually haven't noticed a difference with the exception of an obsession with testing), and we give him as much extra learning as he asks for. Back in NY, public schools are excellent so we never would have considered pulling out of one school just to do something like an IB program (that is also part of this- he will have to go to another school 20 min away whereas we live three minutes from our districted school... he is also convinced the social aspect of changing schools does not worry him; he makes friends easily so we are comfortable following his lead there).

Always- everyone, ALWAYS- go into an interview with how the job was posted and ask about the job duties, preferably to have a written job description.

At one job I didn't need to do this because everyone was honest. But at another I provided descriptions to the applicants that came through my office who I knew were about to meet with sneaky managers trying to game the system in one way or another- whose practices would actually put the company in jeopardy- but worse, scam a potential new hire, which ruins employee morale and satisfaction across departments, and ends in high turnover-- totally counterproductive and harmful to the company!!! I couldn't stand managers that tried to do a bait and switch to get their seats filled, even if I am HR 'first' I am actually *person* first, which should be the reciprocal relationship employers have with their staff (in an ideal world, which big business is usually not- your case in point).

So if OP wants to avoid this bait and switch in the future: go in ""armed"" with how the job was posted, ask for a written copy of the job duties right there, and discuss at the table then.   😊  The body language of the person or people conducting the interview will either agree and be at ease with the request or be made uncomfortable by it-- and that's its own message right there."

You'll be happier not bending over backwards for a lifestyle you don't even have as much time to enjoy. If you make roughly the same neighborhood, wouldn't you want to enjoy a better balance? 

Any time I or my husband have worked more hours just to make a little bit more, something else suffers for our kids and family.

So, you could always change jobs later; for now I'd go with your greater interest keeping in mind that if you do the track for Law, you're making the decision upfront to go into a career with more stress... but again, that's not to say you cannot adjust your path as you have a family, or as you want more free time to do whatever else it is that you want to spend time on barring no family later.

A lot of citizens here now are feeling that way again about merit, etc., since our immigration is something of a mess; a few decades back chain migration was legalized, and people want to eliminate chain migration now.

My dad's in his 70's and I think if he had anything to contribute he'd do it, especially now that us kids are out- but he's retired so what would he provide to Scotland if not working, etc...?

Some of my closest friends in life are or have been a Pisces;  maybe it has to do with my moon.  

I find them very relatable on an emotional level since they tend to accept other people's emotions based on some degree of empathy that they innately have and wish others would have or recognize, if that makes sense... Which is perfect for an Aquarian who wants some detachment but at the basic level still craves emotional connection- we just don't show it outwardly the same way other signs do.

If you can't attend the funeral have you thought about calling and asking in a few weeks if you can stop by their house? When everything settles a little more for them?? Maybe bring a dessert and sit down for a little while and tell them how wonderful your student was- that you're sorry you could not attend the funeral but you aren't able to mourn among so many other people in the circumstance. (You can even be honest: 'I'm highly empathetic and I wish I could have been there to show more support; but I worry that my reaction would have been a distraction.  It's not that I did not attend because I do not care. ')

Something that has stuck with me through the years is a woman who I saw once on TV and she said of her husband passing: she'd rather have had one visitor or ten minute phone call every week for a year than fifty people at the funeral who forgot about her a month later because they've gone back to their regular day-to-day routines. She said a couple of weeks later her house was silent as the calls stopped coming, her loneliness deafening. And that's not to fault people for that because we all have responsibilities that side track us- but an indication of how grieving people, when it's not *real* close to them, can come to closure faster than those touched more intimately by the deceased.

You know this,  I'm sure, but I don't think you understand (or accept) this on an emotional level.  Remind yourself that it requires sacrifice and long hours sometimes- that's the nature of working for something you love, and most people do this even when working in a field they don't like simply because it pays the bills. So, small victory: you are already ahead of the game, at what sounds like a young age. Congratulate yourself on being in a dream company with future potential- that is a big deal!  🎉

(2) Life isn't going to give you accoldaes and you're not going to be known as "" *that* person"" out here like you were 'back there'.  So, and this might be harsh- but from one overachiever to another, get used to not being the person in a room with the glowing reputation. There's nothing wrong with all of those great things being in the past;  you have those to still be proud of; not getting awarded currently like in the past doesn't take away anything from you- UNLESS you do not give yourself space to *not* be perfect and accept yourself exactly as you are today. 

(3) You have had a lot of change- and from change, I think you have a lot of unearthed grief (even if you previously thought you are an adaptable person ). You need to channel that grief into something new to do or learn- and I would say do it on your own, make it *your thing* - not something where you also rely on your husband. Doing this might help you relax and get more in touch with the ""you"" that you knew...  And it might bring up uncomfortable feelings to sit with,  but that will be a good thing because you can get it out and discuss with your therapist.

I have a SS and 2 Bios with my husband. Husband's ex is a person who, generally, has very different priorities. For example: SS got a car when he was 16; it was a decision made by his mother (never asked our thoughts) with the monetary help of that grandmother to kick in some extra money for it. SS mother complained about *ever* driving him anywhere for school/sports/friends, and couldn't WAIT until she didn't have to help him get point A to B, on the couple of days a week she had SS at her house. 

My bio kids on the other hand will not have a car when 16/17. I can think of better things to spend money on for them, and I want to save for them. For instance, SS mother never saved a dime for SS for anything *but* that car in order to get him off her back so she could spend more time doing what she wanted to do, whereas my husband and I socked money away for SS to go on a senior trip to South America in high school and for his college.

Maybe it is also due to SB Dad, a grandparent, generous Aunt, or some other money that was already set aside for SB. That might seem unfair, but that's just the way things go sometimes. 

Don't let this put a wedge between you and your Dad; don't resent him for this. It feels huge right now but I promise it won't be unless you hold a grudge that festers and affects other things. Look on the positive side: Gram is helping you out and you get to enjoy her even more... You will cherish those memories with your Gram one day more than ever caring about getting a car just because your SB got one."

Look at Unique Loom brand. I bought the Pasadena Fars rug (found it on Overstock-probably can check Amazon to compare prices). 

There are several colors to choose from. I'm not much of a 'blue' person for decor, I lean more neutral like you (basically same scheme as your place),  but took a risk on this rug in blue and I'm glad I did- the colors are muted compared to the website and it looks almost like an heirloom. I like it so much I'm buying it in red as a runner for my galley kitchen. 

Also,  the rugs look a little on the small side.  Have you thought about going up in size?"

spirituality,fdjwipf,t3_elnp8a,1578489772.0,"You can ask people not to talk about it with you. You don't even have to be confrontational about it... Just something like,  'Yeah, I've seen what's going on and I'm kind of drained from talking about it right now'. Or, kindly excuse yourself and walk sway. 

I used to watch news 24/7 (WFH and used to have it on in background while working as well as on in the car too)  and I've just decided to watch my morning show for the first hour and that's it. Evening news I gave up on and it feels good. I feel like evening news leans toward even more theatric and sensational stories to 'round out' already serious situations to report on. 

I also left FB and IG a couple of weeks ago started filling my feed here with less serious (and some very comical) subjects that make me laugh or smile and that helps my mindset too."

careeradvice,fdjuv68,t3_elqkob,1578488271.0,"They'll check references, criminal history to make sure you were honest on your application (and I'm assuming that doesn't mean credit score or fingerpritning for a PR job),  and  maybe education. You might be surprised but many employers take someone's word for it when it comes to graduating college if just for a standard Bachelor's degree that isn't a specialty, too. Fewer places than not ask for official transcripts from colleges. 

Anyway. I recruited and worked operations in HR and that's what we did- pretty simple stuff,  even the fingerprinting and credit, if required sometimes. I once had someone indicate that he didn't have a criminal history on his application whereas it popped up that he actually served real time for something drug related as well as two DWIs. He was a pharmacist, so I decided not to hire him since we expect a person of that position handling meds to at least be honest on their application- literally the first impression is one's application and he blew it. 

Sounds like you're off to a good start though,  so enjoy the job and Congrats!"

careeradvice,fdja7jn,t3_elmmcx,1578463006.0,"First look into your company policies and procedures.  You should've gotten a copy of this at hiring.  If not, your HR department  or designated person should have this on file.  If your company doesn't have some sort of non-compete or anything similar like it,  I say it's fair game.  I'd still be confidential about it until the time is right to bring it up if you even need to at some point,  and ask the attorney for confidentiality...  If they don't agree,  then I think that's a good sign not to do business with them anyway. Good luck!"
TwoXChromosomes,fdj9pau,t1_fdj6yrz,1578462547.0,"Yes- so many from out of the Caribbean; I spent many hours sifting through Google about those Drs. schools. Experience with them makes me also believe the education/training must be very, very different. I went all over the place for a decent Dr. and in all my years living in Boca I never found one I trusted across all SE FL. It's hard finding comparable care here when my Drs. up north went to Harvard, Tufts, Cornell.  🤷

The one Dr. now that I love is from India and takes time to listen; my kids doctors are also from India and consistently spend a very good amount of time on actual patient care. I think their training must include whole person patient care, more than the Drs. I came across in SE FL. 

The Dr. I mention that I went to in SE FL, to see if I liked him enough to make him my PCP-- who wanted to ignore my saying I didn't want him doing a GYN check up also (😒)-- was in Coral Springs. He was so pushy questioning why I didn't want to do it; I asked him why he was *insisting* if I already told his staff that I was finding a separate GYN! 😒  Something was not right about it. I ran out,  and then told my friends there to stay away!! 

I am farther north in the state now and there are a small amount of Drs. that went to decent US schools (UF medical and the like), but 99.9% are out of network for me for whatever reason."
TwoXChromosomes,fdj7pag,t1_fdj1s9g,1578460801.0,"It's sad that it's so common, but your comment about meds stikes such a chord with me. I needed meds a few weeks ago for a recurring problem...  You'd think I was asking for oxycontin!! On my third Dr. in urgent care in one week, one finally heard me out that I know my damn body- so she gave me what I asked for. And wouldn't you know two days later I was on the mend,  whereas I was going up and down for two weeks prior trying to stop flare ups. But it took me crying desperately in pain to even be taken seriously. 

Strep is freaking serious, too. In my hometown a father and husband had three limbs partially amputated last year because of complications from not catching his strep infection soon enough, so it wouldn't respond normally to meds, and he was in hospital for months, then months of rehab. WTF!"
TwoXChromosomes,fdj6mnu,t3_elmfsz,1578459919.0,"I swear so many office think we're dumb.  I'm sorry you went through that. 

I moved from a state with exceptional healthcare to one that is known for typically *lesser*- I'll call them- medical professionals (moved from the northeast to the south where many doctors in my state are educated out of the country and you have to research their schools to get an idea of their training philosophy and the time they put it (yes, I've done this- after an experience signing a waiver AGAINST a GYN exam at a PCP and he still expected to put me in stirrups for a standard physical... I don't think so, Doc, didn't you read I signed *against* it!?).  

Needless to say, when I make an appointment with a Dr. I expect to see a Dr.  Where I am now, it is common for offices to schedule a patient with their NP but they'll actually lead you to believe that if you're booking the Dr., that you'll see the Dr. It's a bait and switch.  Yet,  they still charge the fees for seeing a Dr. - not a nurse (sorry nurses- I appreciate you 100%, but if I'm scheduling the Dr., paying for the Dr. and I want the Dr., I should get the darn Dr.). 

I have hopped offices trying to find a Dr. that won't triple book, 'leaving' their NP to ""cover"" their patients. In five years in my new state only one doctor out of the several us women require has seen me at every appointment, and I still don't have a consistent GYN or PCP as a result.

In short- it's a racket,  I feel your pain,  and at what point will something *finally* give with US healthcare. 😩

Sorry for overtaking your rant with just another rant.  😉😊 I'm glad you found your voice and stuck up for yourself...  They'll probably think twice next time before treating you that way."

AskAstrologers,fdgtjw6,t3_el9wrs,1578407960.0,"Also Aquarius sun and can relate;  I know other Aquarius' that also feel what you describe. 

I wonder if it has to do with our ability to detach easily from something that doesn't prove to be loyal,  or potentially loyal. (Or is that just a myth? I feel like for me it's very true with detachment and loyalty.) If we aren't attached deeply,  then things won't be stable,  and without stability there is naturally less security in things.

Anyway,  I don't know the answer but hope someone here has insight.  Hopefully my thoughts don't add to your anxiety.  I guess my point it,  as a fellow Aquarius sun you're not alone."
careeradvice,fdgo555,t1_fdg7t7g,1578403727.0,"Agree with this. 

Had a discussion with my 22 year old about this recently, who lacks passion and wasted a few semesters (and $$$!) changing majors because he expects to be struck all of a sudden with a burning desire.

OP: 

A lot of people's passions won't be in their line of work,  it will be in a hobby. There are people that get lucky to combine the two,  but many need to accept that their job might be just a career and not their life's purpose. If you don't have any hobbies, find one that will bring you satisfaction... This may require trying many different things; and give them each a couple of months, don't just give up on trying a new hobby after a week or two. 

If it's your employer or co-workers making you question your field, put in another six months at the current employer so you have two solid years on your resume and apply for other jobs. Nobody expects a new grad to stay in their first job forever anymore; it is assumed these days that people will change employers every 2,3,4 years while finding their way. (Just don't make a career out of job hopping too frequently.)"
careeradvice,fdgmrn2,t3_el74f3,1578402526.0,"At least if you want to teach,  you will need to gain 'expertise' in any field regardless the level of instruction.  

I worked in HR for a very large, competitive university and people that had experience in their areas of expertise had at least 10 years experience,  usually wrote outside of that (many were published, many as a hobby- but could at least show their passion for their field). These people all had advanced degrees and still worked hard to prove they could be FT, while waiting for the established professors to retire. 

That said, if you're just in for the idea of teaching simply to teach 'something,  anything': (1) Some community colleges might take someone with little experience and/or just a college degree to run a class that serves as a 'bring you up to speed' primer for people that don't meet the standard qualifications through placement testing to make it into ENG 101. That type of class already has all the material laid out by someone else (another professor or the Dean or college board) and you would basically be a sort of substitute teacher guiding curriculum (not exactly teaching), for lack of a better term,  with a couple classes- maybe- a semester (i.e., not enough to live on). I had a friend that did this to fall back on when her high school teaching job was eliminated as she wasn't yet tenured. (2) If you only need a BA or BS to teach VOTEC or middle or high school courses in your state, put in a little more time and see what certifications you need in your state to teach middle or high school.  Engineering programs in school districts are popping up in a lot of towns and will need more of those teachers moving forward as STEM continues to take over."
