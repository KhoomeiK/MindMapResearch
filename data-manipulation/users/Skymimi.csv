I can't thank you enough for your comments. I was in a bad place and my quality of life was very low. I didn't know where else to turn. I am amazed at how it was such a quick turn around. Thank you so much for giving me my health back!"

IAmA,ff3k9ee,t3_erek2q,1579542836.0,"I have developed food sensitivities to all grains, red meat, dairy, strawberries, carrots, eggs, nuts and soy, to name a few. I do best on a diet of veggies, fruit, and chicken, turkey and seafood. I was on allergy injections for over 20 years for inhalants, which I just recently stopped because they weren't making a difference. I have a lot of acid reflux if I don't keep my diet super strict. Could this be associated with gut health? And, why would it? If, not, why would I develop this over time? Any treatments available? Thanks so much for your time."

You may have been asked to leave because you were an ass, but no one would care where you are from if you went in to eat and were a good customer. I hope you get to the source of your anger and address it. You only have one life. It would be sad to live it with such negativity."
