AskReddit,feijmmk,t3_epcbyi,1579140053.0,"I've got a couple different ones. 

The worst one was when I was 19 and went for a few drinks for a mates 18th. We were just casually drinking beers and then we stupidly thought to start drinking absinthe. The next thing I remember was waking up in hospital.

The latest (and confusing) one was on a bender in Hanoi, Vietnam. Just drinking a lot of the cheap, street beer and then I just remember waking up completely naked, in my bed, without a memory of how I got back."
