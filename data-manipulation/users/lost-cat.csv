you still need to take into account materialism.  And once you sprinkle in capitalism, economies, since those countries are competing, they are living in poor conditions at times.

NSFWFunny,feg05cl,t1_feetc11,1579071333.0,"Well depending how sexually repressed people are,  under their religious system. Assuming thats how they see them. I don't see them as 12 year olds. I'm sure people have issues with their own sexuality and frustration, I'm not one to argue on peoples taste, my taste is much older :)  Thats why they tend to have issues with their own pedos in their little communities, voicing their desires like that.

But I can't just your pineapple taste, how ripe do you like to rape them at? when they are nice and virgin or old and ripe?"

LucidDreaming,fed4elb,t3_eoartz,1578998291.0,"I used to preach sleep paralysis is just a lucid dream, years back. Not as much lately. I like to think that this is a nice chain dream cause 1 lucid dream is sleep paralysis, once that ends, another is a lucid dream, well for me anyway, you can continue chaining them along, with each time you wake up and go back to bed right away.  You are usually drifting off into each state of being awake to sleep awake sleep, with random sp episodes in there; I wouldn't say its for everyone cause you wake up a lot.

The back is usually uncomfy for some people, so likelihood of catching that dream transition is more higher.  I used to float out, fly out of my room, all sorts different imaginative attempts, I  usually borrow off of astral projection ideas, where I originally learned, from there I learned that aping was more a lucid dream. Cause b ack then when people did not understand lucid dreaming(no science), it was called Aping...  Whenever I get Sp now a days, I only notice a slight SP sensation and I just sit my dream body up, and good to go for dreaming, I barely even notice it anymore, its more of a reflex for me, from practicing, and my brain caught on it, my brain does it on its own, sets me free prety easily. But eh I havent really dreamed up anything interesting, mostly just sit in room and go back to bed again in dream, get lost in a another dream. Havent really made much effort with my lucid dreams, I am all lucid dreamed out of it already; been preferring my regular dreams, seeing what kind of nonsense it picks up on without me noticing.

If position is not comfortable, odds of it happening are more higher.   Used to get it more on my back, and now on both sides due to the ways I wake up now.

The real secret to sleep paralysis is that, you don't exist there, nor do you exist in lucid dreams. Its just your ego,  placing you into that hallucination in which you control."
