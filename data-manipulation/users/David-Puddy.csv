tooktoomuch,ffu73g9,t1_fftzhtc,1580235878.0,"so ""well known for being used for sex trafficking"" is an article talking about how creepers are getting ""kids as young as eight"" to engage in ""sexual activity online"" in the comment sections of their live videos.


that is a complete fear-mongering, fluff-piece article, which starts by making you afraid of random pedos on tik-tok (in these regards, tik-tok is no different than youtube, twitter, facebook, etc) chatting up your kids in the comment sections of their vids.

then the article explains how to set the most basic of privacy settings, and finishes by reminding you to be very afraid of random pedos online.


as for the rest of that, the same could again be said of any social media app.


>TikTok had vulnerabilities as recent as last month, which allowed attackers to gain control of users accounts to upload videos or view private videos, while a separate flaw allowed attackers to retrieve personal information from TikTok user accounts through the company’s website.

cuz facebook and twitter never get hacked, right?


>TikTok's privacy page admits to collecting as much data as possible, from meta data, GPS location, and pulls all contact information on someone's Facebook and instagram (if connected) and phone, while allowing themselves to use this data for whatever they want. 

this has unfortunately been standard practice for social media apps thanks to facebook.


and the rest is all either about it being owned by china or about it censoring things.


>For those who say Reddit is Chinese owned, it’s not. Although China does own a share of Reddit, it is minimal and as a result, they don't have any control over reddit, let alone what gets to the front page or not. China does own Tik Tok though. https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tencent-reddit-20190211-story.html And https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/reddit-300-million/

the first article has literally no information other than saying that tencent has invested in reddit. you should probably take the habit of actually reading sources you use. the second one is written like a crazy ex-girlfriend (""After no-commenting on our scoop, today Reddit confirmed it has raised [...]"" .. ""Apparently frustrated that we had disrupted its PR plan, [...], which re-reported our scoop without citation."" ) and full of half-truths (""Reddit’s CEO Steve Huffman has had his own problems with attribution after the exec was caught editing users’ comments to mislead viewers into thinking they were insulting their Subreddit’s moderators"" he changed insults to non-insults when directed at him, not quite the same) so i'm not sure how much stock i would put in what they say.

however, even taking them at face value, tencent invested $150M into reddit.

if you don't think they get a say in content moderation, even if a small one, you're crazy.


reddit isn't profitable, nor does it collect particularly useful information, being anonymous. what do you think tencent gets out of investing that much money into reddit?"
