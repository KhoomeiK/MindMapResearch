A song I would put in a top five list is ""San Antonio Rose.""  It did a huge amount for broadening country music in the early years.  I don't think Bob Wills gets enough credit for just how brilliant he was mixing the diverse influences of Western Swing.  To be fair, Milton Brown had a lot to do with that as well, but he didn't live long enough to see Western Swing really develop."
Accordion,ffhocvw,t3_etkyrj,1579945210.0,That's some very fine playing.  I would advise the player to work more on keeping the fingers of his right hand close to the key tops.  There are places where his fingers come far away from the keyboard and it's easier to play accurately with a minimum of motion.  A good example of that was the playing of Charles Magnante.

Mariners,ff6q5nt,t3_erotli,1579632561.0,"I've got a lifetime of Mariners memories going back to watching Alvin Davis as a kid.  I was at the first Tampa Bay Rays game in Seattle in 1997, I was at the longest game in Kingdome history in 1991, I was at the one-game playoff in October 1995 against the Angels, I was at Griffey's last game, I was there for the number retirements for both Griffey and Edgar, I was there for Randy Meyers' blown save against the Mariners in 1996... I've watched a lot of baseball.

My favorite obscure memory is from about 1997 or 98.  We had picked up a reliever in the off-season named Josillas Manzanillo.  He had come here to bolster the shaky bullpens of the late Piniella era.  I was sitting in the 100 level in corporate sponsor seats a friend had gotten for us from his dad who was a wholesale grocery buyer.  We were super close to the field, in the section right behind the walkway.  Sometime early in the game Manzanillo took a line drive directly off his crotch.  Every man in the Kingdome that night winced in sympathetic pain as it happened.  Manzanillo immediately dropped to the ground in the fetal position but then still had the presence of mind to grab the ball laying in front of him and try to throw the runner out at first.  It was one of the longest injury delays I've ever seen in baseball and probably one of the saddest things also because I think that ended his career."

Ayala came in and gave up a bunch of runs and then The Sheriff came in and gave up the rest of them, including the winning run to their backup catcher.  Niehaus was on the TV broadcast at the time and said, ""Friends, don't throw anything at the TV.  It's an expensive appliance.""

ioof,ff1ry4h,t3_er5r8e,1579484847.0,"This is a great question.  I don't believe anyone has examined any kind of environmental factors as they relate to fraternalism.  One good examination of the decline of fraternalism is ""A Young Man's Benefit"" which I have read.  In the book a pair of researchers examine the possibility that the decline in Odd Fellowship was due to the elimination of benefits.  They examine that hypothesis and find evidence that the financial obligations of beneficial membership were not as difficult as was assumed at the time and beneficial membership could have continued for much longer without having become a burden to the Order.

My own personal suspicion about the decline in fraternalism is because of rising economic opportunities following WWII.  As more families became financially secure there was less need for community assistance provided through fraternal orders.  This affected the Odd Fellows especially since that was our core activity.

I would love for someone to do some serious research and test that theory or any other."

Accordion,feq5e9l,t3_eq9gkb,1579337861.0,"Like many others here have said, I recommend getting a teacher.  I teach accordion and I see most of my students struggle to unlearn bad techniques they've picked up from learning on their own.  If you start with a teacher from the very beginning you can avoid that and you'll be able to get to the point where you're playing and enjoying it faster and with less frustration.

Something to go along with that is to keep in mind that the accordion is not the piano.  On a piano you have to put a lot of effort into pressing the keys because key velocity translates into dynamics from the instrument.  The more speed you put into pressing the key, the more energy the hammer imparts to the string and the more vibration you get from it.  On an accordion keyboard it doesn't matter how hard you press the key; you're not getting any sound without the bellows moving.  The best advice I can give you is to always play with your fingers close to the keys.  Don't lift them way up and then bring them down on the keys; the farther your fingers travel, the more chance for inaccuracy you have.  Keep your fingers directly over they keys so they don't have to travel far to press them.

I recommend the Palmer-Hughes Accordion Method.  It's the best graduated program for learning the accordion.  You'll get plenty of technique and theory along the way with that book series.

Most of all, remember that it's OK to learn at your own pace.  I have some students who learn everything quickly and others who take their time.  It's OK to learn as fast as you're comfortable.  You'll reach your goal eventually and you want to make sure that you've learned and practiced accurately along the way.

Have fun and enjoy!"

If you're in North America, the piano accordion is more common so you'll have far more instruments to choose from when looking for one.  If you're in Europe it's the opposite.

Chromatic button accordions are generally five-row instruments where rows four and five are repeats of rows one and two.  That allows you to transpose music by simply moving your hand assuming you've learned the piece in three rows.  That's a big advantage of the CBA.  It's also good to know that there are different systems of CBA: the C-system with C in the outside row, and the B-system with B in the outside row.  Generally, Western Europe plays the C-system and Eastern Europe the B-system, although there are exceptions to that general rule.

CBAs may seem to have more buttons than piano accordions have keys but that's due to the duplication of the first two rows in the last two.  Those are just different places to play the same notes rather than additional notes.  Some CBAs will have a slightly extended range, say 46 notes as opposed to the normal 41 found on piano accordions.

If possible, I would recommend trying both piano and CBA out to see which makes more sense to you.  If you're a strongly linear thinker you might do better with the piano accordion.  Likewise if you've ever had experience with the piano.  Otherwise, there's no bad reason for playing the CBA.  It's a versatile system that's very useful.

Good luck!"

musictheory,fehh9d7,t1_fegsx8f,1579116498.0,"I attended Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle.  We were on the semester system so each semester had about fifteen weeks in it.  For the most part, classes were held in the mornings with an occasional early afternoon class.  Performance ensembles and classes outside our major (humanities, sciences, etc) were held in the later afternoon.

The usual course of study was to take two years of music theory, one year of counterpoint, one year of orchestration, two years of music history, four years of performance ensemble (I did a variety of ensembles), four years of classes outside one's major (I did physics, humanities, dance history, and one other I don't remember), two years of composition seminar (a class where the student composers came together and listened to/studied/evaluated each others' works), four years of composition lab (a class where we would meet/talk with/work with visiting composers), four years of private composition lessons, and maybe a few other things I'm not remembering.

The average day for me was getting up, getting to class by 9am, taking three morning classes, going home and eating lunch, returning for an afternoon class, attending an ensemble rehearsal, and then being free for the rest of the day.  I sometimes had gaps between classes when, for example, I didn't have a 10:30 class on Tuesdays.  I used that time to practice my instruments.  At the end of each semester was an ESP: end-of-semester performance.  I would gather together scores I had written and show them off to a faculty jury who would evaluate them.  Sometimes I would perform the pieces myself, other times I would bring in other performers to do that.

Having so many different ways of learning about music was wonderful.  I got to learn music from the bottom up, from the top down, horizontally, vertically—in so many different ways.  I learned all about chords and how they work in traditional Western harmony.  I learned about counterpoint.  I learned about sequences, motifs, forms, and other ways of organizing musical ideas.  It drastically increased my understanding of music and gave me new tools to use along with my innate creativity.  A lot of people have the idea that music just springs from some place of pure, untempered creativity and is set down on paper in its perfect, final form.  In some cases that's true, but for most of it, there's a complex interplay of inspiration, development, and use of various musical tools.  Music history helped to shed light on how some composers like Mozart were much closer to that ideal and could come up with fully formed, developed pieces almost by ear while improvising whereas others, like Beethoven, Brahms, or Schubert, did a lot of development using counterpoint, harmony, and other devices.  As you study their music and begin to identify the elements of it you see how they used those tools to create what they did.

By the time you're done with a composition degree you should hopefully be able to write music that shows a grasp of various musical elements like creative use of instruments, counterpoint, harmony, development, etc.  Even a short piece of music, like a two-minute song, should be able to demonstrate some amount of that development.

That may be more information that you're looking for but hopefully you'll find some of it helpful."
musictheory,feg2nsy,t3_eoux3z,1579074258.0,"I would never say that you've made a mistake studying composition.  My degree is in composition and I think it was just about the best way to study music in a wholistic way.  I understand music from several different standpoints and I can do a lot of different things because of that.

There's no direct path to a job just because you have a composition degree.  The days of wealthy patrons giving you a country estate to sit and write them music all day and then conduct their court orchestras are over.  One path is to get a graduate degree and become a teacher.  That will keep you in a space where you're always engaged with music and you can share your passion with others and watch the joy of learning as it happens.  Another path is to do start marketing yourself as a composer/arranger.  You can write for film/TV/video games/multimedia.  Be aware that writing for others is more about creating product for clients than it is about indulging your creative impulses.  Sometimes the product that sells is the one you find least fulfilling.  You'll have to decide if that's OK for you.  Another path is to do something else musical in addition to composition like instrumental teaching, performing, management, etc.  You could start with an internship at an arts organization after college and then work your way up in artistic management from there.  Yet another path is to do something non-musical as a day job and keep music as an activity on the side.  The advantage to that is that you're always able to spend your creative time on what's interesting to you instead of what you need to pay the bills and you also always have income for a comfortable life.

Myself, I graduated in 1998 with a degree in composition.  I've done a whole variety of things to get by in life and relatively little of it was writing music.  I've done a lot of arranging, performing, producing recordings, teaching, and a few other related musical tidbits.  I've also worked as a user interface designer (based on my skill with desktop music publishing), an auto mechanic, and a scrap metal seller.

There's no prescribed path to a fulfilling career as a composer.  It doesn't work like that.  It's not like graduating with a business degree and then getting hired as a budget analyst.  It's a much more complex, uncharted process.  For some, the lack of a set pathway is exhilarating and brings a sense of adventure.  For others, it's anxiety-inducing.  Whatever you decide, remember that learning a skill like writing music is highly specialized and valuable for its own sake and that you've not wasted a moment of your life in its pursuit.

Good luck!"

I know that here in Washington we have a digital copy of our digest and it has the balloting ceremony, charter-draping ceremony, and several others.  The best place to check would be with your Grand Secretary.  If not, it's possible one of us could share that information with you.

Seahawks,fe6c6a6,t1_fe6a5he,1578886707.0,"So long as we have someone next year who doesn't take ninety minutes to figure out their defensive scheme is ineffective, I'm happy.  I don't think Norton can make the adjustments quickly enough.  I was hopeful that we'd play more nickel against the Packers and have more effective pass coverage but that didn't happen.  We were weak covering the middle of the field again and Rodgers knew exactly how to exploit that and he did it masterfully in the first half.  We got more pressure on him in the second half, which helped keep him from making some of those throws, but he still was able to make some of them when it really counted, like on third down.  We need some different personnel in key places and a more adaptable defensive coordinator."
