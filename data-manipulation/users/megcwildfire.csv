depression,ffg7cd6,t1_ffg78zi,1579900026.0,I've just never felt so alone in my life. I feel like I could just disappear and no one would know. Ya know?
OSHA,ffcwgzn,t1_ffcw9rn,1579808710.0,"Yeah well I agree with that. I mean obviously here everyone can and should help, but if you are trying to give CPR and the closet you've come to first aid is watching Greys Anatomy then you're automatically doing more harm than good. I think that's all they're trying to avoid."
OSHA,ffcsbud,t1_ffcpbhl,1579806251.0,Well if you're a first aider and you don't provide care when you could've it's an issue in the same way that providing improper care when you have no training can make you liable.. I suppose South Africa has different legislation to other places.
OSHA,ff8ul66,t3_ermixi,1579696612.0,"Technically the first aid kit is supposed to be locked by law. In RSA at least. The point is that no one can steal from it or try to treat themselves and mess up even more and make the actual first aider legally liable.
The principle is that you have one or two first aiders (or as much as necessary) and they are supposed to be around all the time, and they have the key. It forces you or someone else around when you get hurt to go get the first aider to make sure you get the best, legal care possible."

(It's not all 100% true for me but it comes close. Oops)"
depression,ff8lv9p,t1_ff8dlag,1579684911.0,Not that kind of numbness... I mean I am officially doctor diagnosed with depression.. I just still feel like an imposter... but thanks for the info! Actually very interesting
depression,ff5u277,t1_ff5sjb0,1579610249.0,Usually... the last few days I haven't been able to motivate myself to do anything or care about anything.
funny,ff5tme1,t3_erlyam,1579609783.0,We do that when we park in South Africa... but only in areas that offer car washing. It shows you want them to wash your car while you're out.
depression,ff35y20,t3_erb1v7,1579534464.0,Aye
depression_help,ff24drc,t1_ff24747,1579493483.0,Thanks! Yeah it's been a year and a half. So still early on but far enough in that I don't wanna just walk away
depression_help,ff0d8nl,t3_er0pvo,1579467800.0,"Hey.. I'm so sorry to hear that you've gotten that tired. I understand exactly where you're coming from and the situation you're in right now. But I'm also really glad to hear that you're still going to work and acknowledge you're not feeling yourself. Even the smallest things can help.. I can promise you that you will be missed if you were to not wake up again. 

Talk to someone. But remember that it'll only help if you want it to. Find someone you trust or a good psychiatrist and talk it out. Allow yourself to be helped and you'll get there step by step. 

Good luck!"

Too bad on the puns but thanks"
eroticauthors,fezllnh,t1_fezks4a,1579458662.0,"At this point I have no idea. I mean, my books will be my babies.. but still. Why is it so difficult!?"
depression,fexjmqa,t3_eqs4h8,1579432055.0,Too true... I'm getting tired of things getting better because then when things take a turn for the worse again it gets a bit worse every time. So the happier I am and the longer I stay that way gets 'balanced' by the downturn again. As if the bad now has to 'make up' for all the time things were better.
DnD,ferxci7,t1_ferx4tn,1579359328.0,Makes sense.. thanks
DnD,ferohov,t1_ferofow,1579356512.0,Okay cool that sounds good too

humanresources,fent75q,t1_fensy50,1579290438.0,Oh wow that's a very complete answer thanks so much for taking the time to reply and help!
humanresources,femv5pa,t1_femuvpa,1579270449.0,"I know yeah. I'm one of those people that have a hard time letting go of even the smallest aspect of my job. I feel like I have to focus on everything. 

Thank goodness people on this sub know what they're talking about and can help out. Now I realize I should probably let it go and focus on my other HR work. Thanks!"
humanresources,femo7x5,t1_femnto2,1579264467.0,Fair enough. Guess I've never really looked at it like that. Thanks! (I always feel I have to prove myself. Probably my worst weakness)
humanresources,femehb4,t1_femeflq,1579251295.0,Great advice. Thank you. I'll definitely try and go about it that way.
humanresources,femct0v,t1_femcohu,1579248967.0,Exactly. I figured I'd let it slide because it was 'their department' but it's happened a bunch now. It's getting a bit irritating. I feel like I don't really have an HR job anymore. I've somehow been downgraded to just admin.
Tinder,fejzave,t3_epgtri,1579189241.0,Oh wow what's wrong with us South Africans? That's a whole new level of crazy stupid

AskReddit,fd0jp3j,t3_ejt08r,1578119797.0,"Had a girl 'friend' (about 15) who would come over a lot when I was about 7 or so and make me play a game where my mom couldn't see. She always made me go down on her or things like that. 
I thought it was just a fun thing all friends did. Turns out she was molesting me. 

I only realised about 10 years later how messed up it was."

AskReddit,fc66aix,t3_egaw70,1577473247.0,"It was last New Years Eve. Me and my boyfriend were staying at his  friends huge penthouse apartment, just the two of us. It's my first time there so I don't know the layout very well. 
So we walk down to a local bar we go to a lot to go drinking with friends. Somewhere during the night my drink got spiked and I woke up with a huge hangover and a twisted ankle. 

Once I fully wake up and start feeling like a human again my boyfriend tells me about what I did. 
Apparently he put me in bed and went to go play some PC games. After a few minutes he hears some banging from the room. I apparently couldn't find the actual bathroom, and mistook the window ledge as the toilet seat, proceeded to pull my pants down, pee on the floor, and get back into bed as if nothing happened. He had to clean it up while hysterically laughing. 

I don't remember a single thing about it and still go full on red when I think about it."

AskReddit,fc2ovtb,t3_efj5g9,1577369537.0,"Had sex on the bar counter of a bar me and my friends frequent, with the best looking bartender at around 4 in the morning.

After he had his finger in me, behind the bar, while we were talking to a friend standing on the other side. He then pulled it out and licked it off (that was the kinkiest part for me personally). Couldn't wait for the friend to leave and as soon as he did he picked me up onto the counter and just went at it."
