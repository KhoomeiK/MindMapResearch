WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fez20a9,t3_equyjo,1579453122.0,I had a ridgie. Beautiful dog in so many ways. His tail could clear coffee tables in one swoop! But had been a product of back yard breeding and had multiple medical issues. He had a short but very happy life with us. I miss him.

fixit,feyqso1,t1_few23wn,1579449371.0,I saw a video of someone pulling a dent with their dildo once. Worth a try.
holdmyfeedingtube,feybyh2,t3_eqlpsj,1579443497.0,And that's how you cause a head injury.
aww,fey9ngf,t3_eqtkzo,1579442610.0,Thank you so very much.
TBI,ferslzp,t3_eqcs4u,1579357912.0,"Your medical records would be one place to start. Records would show if you were treated for a head injury.Do you remember any bruising behind your ears? People often get this after a blow to the head, behind either one or both ears. It's called 'Battle sign' and is indicative of concussion. Or, ask your parents. They are usually the best source of info. 

Also, if you've been drinking until your blackout drunk for the past eight years, surely you can't expect to recall those eight years? Blackout typically means just that, nothing. No memories or recall of what went down. But if you mean you can't recall much prior to those drinking years, then know that most of us struggle to remember details from that long past. Sure, big events or meaningful stuff is stored, but who has room for storing aunt Wendy's birthday date, or where she lived in 1992? Don't stress yourself trying to recall stuff. And try not to think negative. You've done an awesome job of reaching this far, just look ahead. Your doing great! 

I don't think you have an injury. I think you have alcohol related memory loss. Which as you get older can become an issue, but for now, work on keeping your brain active. Do puzzles and read books, expand your knowledge, learn a new skill, just keep it active. Excercise your brain like you would your body! You'll be OK mate."
