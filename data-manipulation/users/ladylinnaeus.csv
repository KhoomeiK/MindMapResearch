misanthropy,fgv1c3p,t3_ezfmgm,1581134387.0,"My sister-in-law and I are both massively annoyed when the family gets together. We can’t talk to each other over the noise, and we can’t escape, so we text each other our gripes in real time across a crowded room. I sometimes hear her giggle at my sarcastic texts but we never make eye contact, just hide secretly in our silent digital cave together. It helps, truly."
science,fgv07ve,t3_f0g5ob,1581133540.0,Good luck getting this to go thru
AskBiology,fgl3m3k,t3_ez4aur,1580880953.0,"Welp they would be “non-native” to the area, but “invasive” refers to how much they take over and drive out other species or otherwise change the ecosystem. They could exist as a relatively uncommon species in the West, and that would make them non-native but also not invasive."
ACT,fgl3ccb,t3_eyur8u,1580880716.0,"Were you the only one, or was it everyone at that location that day? If a lot of people are affected, get the local news to do a spot on it. ACT won’t like the bad press... Although I realize it’s the couriers fault so maybe it won’t matter. In my state 400 tests were lost after an ACT at a school and it went to national news. They never found them tho."
AskaChemist,fg6yu9v,t3_ex445k,1580580044.0,"Sorry I am not answering your question but instead giving unsolicited advice. Since they are both small and lightweight things, why not just spray something like hairspray on the popcorn and sprinkle the parsley on it while it’s still wet? Obviously I don’t know exactly what you’re trying to do for your production so this may not be the best solution but it seems more efficient to me."
oddlyterrifying,fg5nwed,t1_fg539xs,1580532809.0,The thoracic can’t go too cray cray cuz they in charge of the ribcage. Also I think their spinous processes limit extension.

HumansBeingBros,fg5mfhv,t3_ewxacn,1580531545.0,In my area they have been written in almost every pump in several neighboring towns/ cities. It’s always the third button from bottom on right side of screen. Those ads give me super anxiety and make it hard to listen for randos coming to talk to me while I gas up. I am extremely grateful for the cheat code writers and I mute the ads every time.
