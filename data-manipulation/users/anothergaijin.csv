gifsthatkeepongiving,fgfmqah,t1_fgfbnyw,1580742805.0,How many shows can boast so many characters that people can name? There is at least 10 major characters and more than a dozen minor characters that many people can recall - I can’t even remember the main cast of Friends or Seinfeld and that’s only 4 people each
technology,fg8ghqe,t1_fg7hw02,1580618787.0,It’s so slow tho
technology,fg8gfnz,t1_fg7l34p,1580618739.0,USB Power Delivery is the fucking bomb. I carry a large 96W charger and a compact 61W charger and anything USB-C I own will charge from either one at its maximum possible charging speed safely every time.
technology,fg8g4y2,t1_fg7ummz,1580618488.0,"Yup, I actively choose USB-C devices and refuse anything else. Laptop, table, headphones, portable speaker, storage, flashlight, mobile battery, gaming console, etc.

My iPhone is the last non-USB-C device I carry."
teslamotors,fg6l7y7,t1_fg34xis,1580570905.0,And format it like this - https://youtu.be/pL4FWP8LM1k?t=18
teslamotors,fg6l6jn,t3_ewhocy,1580570875.0,"My 2016 Nissan X-Trail has 360-degree camera thanks to merging 4x cameras.

It's absolutely amazing and lets you very easily, safely and quickly reverse, even in very difficult situations. It's also great for spotting things that are completely in your blindspot in a normal car and may not possible trip a sensor - like a skateboard or a small box.

It looks like this on the right: https://youtu.be/pL4FWP8LM1k?t=18"
MovieDetails,fg05965,t1_fg02ggd,1580400501.0,"I enjoyed CEotTK, Arrival, Interstellar and Contact in that they don’t have a hard ending but instead just lay it all out for you and you are left thinking about it"
PublicFreakout,ffzfw89,t1_ffzb9hw,1580377041.0,I think I remember from high school chemistry that soaps work by attracting fats and oils so they can be removed from surfaces and rinsed off
freefolk,ffwqb5e,t1_ffw5h1b,1580308409.0,GRRM has already said it was one of his major twists
dogswithjobs,fft1hcz,t1_ffsxr9w,1580202007.0,That’s going to give you one very intelligent mix
lego,fft1f1c,t1_ffszjfa,1580201911.0,"Yeah, and I saw this in a store maybe a week or two after the episode - crazy!"
television,ffm5saa,t1_ffm3dhr,1580048983.0,And some of those were the worst stories.... they could have at least used the good material
television,ffm5mx1,t1_fflyjit,1580048862.0,"I think so too, but that’s much more than 3 movies. The Vong are like the Borg - utterlybalient, redoculously advanced and untouchable, and just an unstoppable unending force.

Nothing I was excited for ended up happening - Imperial Remnant, General Han Solo, Mara Jade, Thrawn and everything in between."
freefolk,ff1lkkv,t1_ff1des3,1579481167.0,"The long night should have been multiple episodes with us hearing about different parts of Westeros being completely overrun and the continent being thrown into darkness and deep winter.

There should have been more buildup and more threatening before the last fight"
