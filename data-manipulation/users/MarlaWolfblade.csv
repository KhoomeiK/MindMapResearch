pics,ffhir1e,t1_ffhho31,1579937094.0,"What I found helped my concentration in the past was using a ruler, preferably an opaque one. I'd hold it under the line I was reading and move it down when I got to the end of the line. It made it much harder for me to skip and miss a few lines or a paragraph, which meant I was taking in a lot more and my comprehension improved too. It sounds kind of dumb but when I was reading ""difficult"" books it made a world of difference. Might be worth a try for you. And huge kudos for starting with Moby Dick!"
aww,ffhhlhr,t1_ffhhhee,1579935590.0,It gave me an actual lol because it's exactly the sort of thing my brother would say :)
aww,ffhhgfu,t1_ffhevg4,1579935411.0,The typo makes it so much better
ProjectRunway,ffguts6,t1_ffgnsq1,1579915625.0,"That's exactly it I think. Bishme had one message he wanted to get across. Something that was deeply important to him which made it very genuine. Sergio just picks a random issue out his arse and uses it as ""inspiration"". If he stuck to one or two things that he cared about, that he was actively involved in, it'd feel a lot more sincere."

torties,fffmyhx,t1_fffk3hr,1579887432.0,"Used to have a tortie who had resting sad face. Didn't matter what she was doing, she looked like her heart was breaking. She was the best girl."
povertyfinance,fffkigx,t1_fffj3r3,1579885936.0,"The market is absolutely saturated with college/university graduates because companies decided you need a degree for even entry level jobs. As I said in a different reply though, knowing and *knowing* things aren't the same. So as one ""failure"" to another, take care of yourself and try not to be too harsh on yourself."
britishproblems,ffede75,t1_ffd8qlu,1579843923.0,I used to love a horseradish sandwich. Bloody lovely.
rpghorrorstories,ffe4x7x,t1_ffdp79y,1579836796.0,I think I remember that one. Was it on AITA and linked here?
povertyfinance,ffd16zo,t1_ffd0rkv,1579811392.0,And you as well :)
povertyfinance,ffd06um,t1_ffczf41,1579810837.0,You're absolutely right and in my head I know it. But knowing it and *knowing* it are very different and I don't quite *know* it yet. Y'know?
povertyfinance,ffcw96i,t1_ffcka8e,1579808578.0,"I had to move in with my mum in 2017/18. My mental health is pretty poor and she has mobility issues. We definitely take care of each other. It does feel like I've failed by having to move home, but if I hadn't I'd probably be dead by now."

gwent,ffb2wxy,t3_eskpo8,1579750430.0,Oh! I've not played since Homecoming and I thought I was causing this somehow. It feels like a third of my matches end this way.
nottheonion,ffakti4,t1_ffafz2b,1579738249.0,"Had that rule at my school too. Christ, it was fucking stupid. One winter, the heating gave out so we had teachers wrapped up in coats and scarves telling students to take theirs off. We had no lockers or cloakroom or any kind of storage area for them either so it wasn't uncommon to see someone with their PE kit, art folder, musical instrument *and* coat as well as the normal backpack struggling with the doors. Absolute fucking bullshit."

rpghorrorstories,feznljf,t1_fez1ena,1579459377.0,Library? My local has a few rooms that you can book for free for a few hours.
baldursgate,fep3aio,t1_fep2v2y,1579311173.0,"It would be the most appropriate skill. For example, picking a lock to get into the dungeon, the GM might ask for sleight of hand + dex, or if you were trying to talk your way in it could be persuasion + cha. The GM will decide what difficulty (DC) you need to beat, you roll your d20 and add your proficiency and/or skill bonuses. To be clear, this is based on 5e rather than AD&D because that's what I have experience playing and GMing irl."
LoveNikki,feoz69h,t3_eq914o,1579308567.0,I've come to the conclusion that the designers are using Bayonetta as a reference.
britishproblems,fe15hql,t1_fe10vtp,1578822701.0,Definitely not. OP was in a Wetherspoons.
suggestmeabook,fdtqlp4,t3_emuvtz,1578720667.0,Take a look at Philippa Gregory. She has a series of 15 books that follow various members of the Tudor and Plantagenet families. Might be what you're looking for.

aww,fdm7bj5,t3_elzgxc,1578541571.0,I feel like I could tell him my problems and he'd tell me it'll be okay and give me a sweet.
boardgames,fdfkx1a,t3_el3cel,1578364091.0,Yes! My brother and I had the travel version in the car for long journeys when we were young. I'm pretty sure we got it from the Tower of London actually. Not thought about it in ages but it was a really nice little game.
Awwducational,fd61w9z,t1_fd61b59,1578184399.0,"As far as I know we just call them Wagtails. I live in North Wales, so it's possible there's a Welsh term for them that I don't know though."
Awwducational,fd5yxfw,t3_ek2yzr,1578183260.0,I love these guys! There's a couple who like to chill out in my garden and annoy my cats by prancing up and down the window ledge.
