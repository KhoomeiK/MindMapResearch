I was curious why they would need to blow this area up, what is it going to be? Military? Commercial? Is this a large enough area using enough explosives to make people sick? It looks like it is in the middle of no where. Lots of questions."
oddlysatisfying,ffndzh8,t3_eu6orr,1580064687.0,What is the chemical/carcinogen load with that blast?
talesfromHR,ffmb7i6,t3_dovgmg,1580051680.0,"We have a saying in HR...usually related to surveys and feedback/reviews. “Don’t ask the question if you don’t intend on doing anything about it.” 

This applies to everything from what kind of candy to put in the vending machine to 360-degree feedback. 

Feedback is such an easy thing to manage if you have a little time and money to invest in a competent HR person.

AskReddit,ffm9bpx,t1_ffio6t9,1580050879.0,"That is incredibly unprofessional of her. I get how frustrating it can be to see a few take advantage of the system but wow, publicly saying something like that?!?!? How can an employee trust her? I never have to wonder why HR has such a shit reputation. Sigh."

samharris,ffi8quu,t3_ets1p3,1579967997.0,"Thank you for sharing this. It was nice to watch something that didn’t make my blood boil and my brain hurt. 

It is good to talk about tough topic but best to discuss them respectfully. Everyone knows this, just takes a little effort to do it well. It just comes down to “are you I will or unable.” 

If you are unable, I’ll work with you. If you are unwilling, then there’s nothing I can do to help."
AskReddit,ffi6vi8,t1_ffhuluq,1579966657.0,"I’ve written/updated/edited at least 100 employee handbooks. Read many more. This seems like an easy error to catch and fix. You are right to wait until they fix it. 

Side note...so many HR folks and managers don’t read the handbook. More than r/mildlyinfuriating. 

Do we have an r/stupidHRshit? I could write a book. Some of my colleagues are awful."
science,ffi6cha,t1_ffhwrlz,1579966268.0,Yes. I’m 5’9” 130lb 50yo. I want to get back to 125-127...ate so much over the holidays. Sweets are my Kryptonite. This is what I do. The science sounds so obvious but people might need reminding sometimes.

PoliceBrotality,ffi2vua,t3_etqy8v,1579963489.0,"That is so cool! Was this just for fun or was the student drummer unable to play that day?

My daughter loves her school resource officer. He is strict (no get out of jail free cards) but very fair and respectful to the kids. He just left the school because he has cancer. Not sure how the new one will operate.

And your school district fucking sucks, go after them for the abuse and the extortion...$600? Sending a video does not come close to that expense even if you include the salary for the several minutes it took someone to copy and send the video."
nottheonion,fess4sn,t1_fespvfn,1579368451.0,"Right! It would kill me to see my kids hurt this way...it was horrible watching someone else’s child be tormented. 

This is bullshit. Who are these parents? I’m a parent and my kids protected/defended those who got bullied. Wtf. These are young children. 

Let the games begin. The ridiculous people and tolls will start defending the bad behavior and providing reasons why it’s so hard to be a parent, etc. no accountability. I’ve always worked 50+ hours per week, was a single mom, cooked and kept my kids clean while growing small people into proper teens/adults."
nottheonion,fesq45x,t1_fesa7fo,1579367845.0,That was my first thought.
AnimalsBeingBros,fespe4t,t1_fesnojd,1579367610.0,"I have to agree with you, especially since OP didn’t respond to the RFIs. 

I so love the idea of this post. And love the true stories of animals being bros."
atheism,fdqi1rd,t3_elvscx,1578667186.0,"Sometimes you think, ""I've been in therapy for years, I am trying to eat better, I am working on getting enough sleep, I read helpful books/articles, etc."" But like many things, it took years to get you to this level of <<insert appropriate word...pain, weight, damage, etc...>>, it will take at least that long to undo/change it.

I hope you will give yourself the time and kindness to unfuck what that horrid woman did to you. I'm 50 and I am still working on ways to improve my thinking and be more gentle with myself. The work will never be done, but is it ever really done for self aware human?

Sending you a big mom hug."

Neal Trautman, Ph.D. Director of the National Institute of Ethics, “How to be a Great Cop.” “We’re finding the numbers are pretty constant,” experts say the number of police officers who run afoul of the laws they’re sworn to uphold is low. “It is less than 1 percent.”"
PoliceBrotality,fdm9nh5,t1_fdjflby,1578543287.0,Thanks. I didn’t know the acronym ACAB.

“People. They’re not ALWAYS a bunch of bastards.”  

Are you saying people aren’t always bastards or cops aren’t always bastards?

I agree if you are referring to people in general. So many bastards. If you are referring to police, then I take issue with this statement. 

The % of cops who are bastards is far less than the % of bastards in almost every other profession. The interpretation of this statement changes the good vibe one can get from reading this story.  

And yes, I know there are many horrible people who are cops who do horrible things. Just wanted to understand what OP meant."

I’m always surprised that people here in the US feel they cannot be open with everyone about being atheist (with the exception of a few small towns in certain areas of the US.) we all know where these towns are."

LifeProTips,fct0h1g,t1_fcsp1cn,1577929690.0,"Pictures of the grandfather are always nice, maybe do a google search—could find something interesting your dad didn’t know or forgot. If you are really ambitious, go to the library and do a little research on the family. 

When you call, you could have a new Q each time, for ex. What is your favorite memory of your dad from when you were a kid? Was there one thing you learned from your dad (that he said is just demonstrated?) did you get away with anything as a kid, something your dad didn’t know about? How did grandma and grandpa get through the rough times? What did grandpa think about ______ (the war, JFK, MLK, etc?)

Let your dad know that you want to pass these stories on to your family, children, etc."
