AskReddit,ffjkh3i,t1_ffjf1b2,1580000286.0,"Speaking as someone who does smoke, you aren't wrong. Many of my friends smoke every day, and honestly they are less fun to be around as a result. There's a laid-back attitude many of them have that makes planning things really hard. And like, its fun to be high and all, but you don't grow as a person when you spend all your free time smoking.

Pro-drug people never talk about the bad things, anti-drug people never talk about the good. Its really hard to find the truth in the middle of that. But there are always downsides, and though I will probably piss some people off, marijuana makes you less interesting as a person the longer you use it."
AskReddit,ffjiz0a,t1_ffji7wz,1579999286.0,"Seriously, being an introvert isn't stopping you, the only thing holding most people back from doing something as simple as reaching out is their own insecurities. It is difficult, sure, but certainly not impossible to put in equal effort in your friendships. Convincing yourself that you can't helps no one, and spreading that message just exacerbates the problem (such as it is). 

I completely agree with you, but I see too many people in this thread complaining about losing friends, and also making excuses for why they never put in the effort to maintain those relationships. It isn't that organizing things is easy for the person doing it, I've been the one in my group doing it and after a certain point it just isn't worth putting more energy into a person who never pulls their weight."
todayilearned,ffhndj4,t1_ffhlpyt,1579943722.0,"That's what redundancy is for, the chance of all of the passive safety features failing simultaneously is nearly nil. Plus, even if we have one or two more Fukishimas (which we won't, not with modern reactors) the environmental impact would still be way lower than continuing to pollute. 

I would rather not have global warming cause massive economic and societal collapse, and even if nuclear was dangerous the risk would be worth it. We don't exactly have many realistic choices here."

Solar panels make a lot more sense for specific applications than for powering the grid. Nuclear really does make the most sense, eventually fusion will solve some of the problems with fission, but until then we should really be investing more heavily in the technology that works."
UpliftingNews,ffdocab,t1_ffdgnuh,1579825150.0,"That is super interesting, I wonder what factors effect this? Is it just the way men and women are socialized in society? Or the way homosexuality is treated? Maybe since abuse is traditionally seen as something men do to women, and many of the messages seem aimed at men, (until recently at least) we see men being more aware of their actions? There are just so many questions I have here. Looking forward to when studies come out in future years about this."

AskReddit,ffdhenb,t1_ffcvykn,1579820916.0,"Some pure mathematicians work to explain it. Things like the fundamental axioms of various fields of math, you can't really explain those but everything else is built on them. Often they are super simple, and things most people never consider. Mathematical proofs are often difficult to understand and boring to most people, but end up doing exactly what you are talking about.

Trying to explain ""why"" after a certain point becomes more philosophy than math. But that's true with physics too currently. Questions like ""why does anything exist?"" aren't exactly answerable, and there may always be unanswered questions."
unpopularopinion,ffd1dwl,t1_ffcfhkx,1579811500.0,"So, because under 25 you are not as good at making decisions you should not have a voice in this country? But what about if you become senile with age, you aren't very good at making decisions then, so should you be restricted from voting as well? And if the goal is to make sure that the people voting are responsible, and able to make good decisions we should put in some kind of test for how well people make decisions. Maybe, people can only vote if they pass a simple test of, say, critical thinking. How about if everyone with an iq lower than 90 doesn't get to vote? I've met people in their 30s dumber than some teenagers, should they get to vote?

I was under the impression that voting is, in essence, the voice that everyone gets in our country. At 18 or so most people are either done with or almost done with their state-sponsored schooling. Then they enter the workforce, or pursue higher education of some kind. This is the age when most people are forced to make life altering decisions about their future. Shouldn't they get a say in how the country is run? Plus the voting age was lowered due to the draft, should we raise both? Would we?

18 is an arbitrary age, but as a society we have a culture that sees 18 as the start of adulthood, I don't see why that has to change to 25."

AmItheAsshole,ffapguc,t1_ffalbm9,1579741423.0,"The problem is that people who understand this don't generally play the lottery. The return for most people of just not spending on tickets and rather investing that money would be a decent amount by retirement. I don't mean people who buy a ticket a month for fun or whatever, but the people who actually see the lottery as something that could conceivably win. 

Humans do not have an instinctual grasp of probabilities, you can't rely on your intuition when it comes to them. So people who try to do so often make mistakes or get taken advantage of."

unpopularopinion,ff5jh63,t1_ff5igsx,1579595766.0,"This is the truth here, they don't measure intelligence so much as some aspects of it. Having a higher iq generally means you are ""smarter"" than someone with a significantly lower iq, but that does not directly translate to real world performance for a variety of reasons. These tests falling out of style is not a bad thing.

Also, as a non-english speaker you will do worse on an iq test designed by native English speakers than another native speaker. Obviously. But it is something to keep in mind when looking at scores of different demographics."
AskReddit,ff4sjls,t1_ff4ndcg,1579571411.0,"I've had dream sec once before, but it was during a bout of four back-to-back terrible dreams. I had slept three hours, taken my family to the airport, and was trying to sleep again and had a bunch of super vivid, very uncomfortable dreams. From what I remember all of them involved me being able to think but not control my body, so it was not a good experience. But it is possible.

Of course I haven't been able to remember any good dreams since my childhood. And even then usually the ones I remembered involved being scared or disturbed enough to wake me up, then the memory fades and I'm left with this impression of something bad having happened."
MurderedByWords,fex8fc5,t1_fewj7j2,1579426797.0,"They aren't though. The difference here is that when we start altering ourselves like that humanity will change on a fundamental level. 500 years ago humanity was almost the same genetically, minus some resistances to disease. The only real thing that has changed since we invented civilization has been ideas, any one of us born 500 years ago would be just as primitive as you view them."
PrequelMemes,fewoiow,t1_fewh6sq,1579417066.0,"My opinion isn't anything new, the general story of the prequels is good, but the execution was poor. ROTS is the best of the 3, and where most of the memes are from, though it could have used some editing to improve certain scenes. They don't feel cohesive enough (though no where near as bad as the sequels) to be seen as a good trilogy. 

You can really tell that the general story is good because of how well the Clone Wars builds it's stories around it. I wish we could have a better version of the prequels, with better writing, directing, editing, and in some cases acting. There is so much potential, but they just do not work very well as movies. 

I can love the prequels for what they are, despite all their flaws I still am glad they exist, and enjoy all the happiness they have brought me. I just know they could have been better, and that makes me sad for what could have been."
science,few1odw,t1_feuy1hu,1579404222.0,"If people don't vote the problems won't get fixed. It's a catch 22, but really the only choice is to vote, because then there is a chance of improvement. Not voting at all will just make things worse. That's why I don't get why people don't vote, whatever reason given is one that can only be fixed by politicians that want to solve the problem. And they will only be elected if people vote for them."
science,few1aua,t1_fevyeck,1579404047.0,"Exactly this, gerrymandering is a problem because people didn't vote in the past in smaller elections. Now its an uphill battle to fix, but that is no reason to give up. By not voting in every election you can you ensure that problems like this will never get fixed. If everyone voted every time they could these problems would go away more quickly then they currently are."
AskReddit,feo3uqt,t1_fenxvaz,1579294738.0,"People aren't built to feel 100% happy all the time, at least not naturally. If we were there would be no reason to improve, so even as the world gets better all the time we generally feel the same. Otherwise society would have stagnated back in prehistory. 

It isn't impossible to find happiness like you said, but it has to come from within, not an external source. That isn't to say having nice things (financial stability, friends, health, etc) doesn't make it easier/possible."

So, it isn't hard to take a trans person at face value when they struggle to describe gender dysphoria. Stuff like truly intense grief, the love a parent feels for a child, most mental illnesses, drugs of any type (recreational or medical), all cannot be explained to someone who hasn't experienced them. And it is easy to understand that I have no reference for any of them, same as being trans."
virginvschad,feiiu20,t1_feiek7i,1579139529.0,"I wouldn't say absolutely beneficial, more they absolutely have the potential to be beneficial. Drugs effect people in different ways depending on many factors, and psychidelics are also reliant on having a good setting if you want a useful experience. Taking psilocybin because you are depressed is probably not the best idea, unless you have done a decent amount of research, have a good trip sitter, maybe even have some benzos around to kill the trip if necessary. 

I have friends (also me) who have had terrifying experiences on psychidelics, these are not things you want to mess around with, trust me."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fecloc2,t1_fec1j4g,1578976987.0,"I don't think it's price gouging so much as just the fact that care of that level costs so much. Sure, there's some bullshit like all healthcare in America (I'm assuming), but it's not like nurses are being paid fat wages for working in group homes. 5k+ a month ends up being close to fair with the price of insurance, facilities, staff, administration, and whatnot. 

I do not have any idea of how to solve the problem. The government here already spends a massive amount on social security and medicaid for the elderly, and part of the reason nurses are paid so little is that medicaid doesn't pay as much as insurance (or so I've heard). Good luck retiring in the future, it will probably be even more expensive then, especially if you are trying to prolong your life with all the crazy medical treatments that will exist. I don't expect those to be cheaper in the future."
todayilearned,fdzars8,t1_fdytkw9,1578788284.0,"Dissolve out the cannabinoids with something that evaporates off with no residue. BHO is butane hash oil, you use butane to dissolve only the good stuff, seperate it and let it evaporate off.  There are a number of ways to do this, like using CO2 instead, but they are all either reasonably complex or dangerous. 

I would advise buying concentrates from someone else, and if you do plan on making them know that professional equipment is expensive, while homemade is often unreliable. 

Generally BHO has about 70% thc by mass, compared to 20% or so for flower (can be higher or lower, depending on strain). But I recommend it, the high is different, just be careful not to do too much at once, you'll be super vegged out."
unpopularopinion,fdz565n,t1_fdyyafk,1578786777.0,"Pretty much anything that someone builds their entire personal image around ends up being cringy. People who can only talk about their favorite media (and nothing else), of which there are just so many examples (think of any fandom, I'm sure some examples come to mind). People who are very superior about their work, or their religion, or their race/ethnicity/heritage or whatever. 

Its not just pride, its superiority that makes these sorts of people annoying. Often this is mixed with some willful ignorance, so only *their* job is hard, and they can't hear anything else. Its a very easy pattern to fall into, though I'm not quite sure why tbh."

And while that isn't the optimal way to handle the situation, its a very human one. All of his frustration at who he is, and people not being there for him is easy to sympathise with. 

His hatred of Sveta reminds me of her hatred of all things Cauldron, and how both are unwilling to give either a second chance. Just as Sveta didn't try to understand Contessa, (who just kind of took it) Egg doesn't try to understand her. Maybe I'm reaching here, but it seems similar to me."
