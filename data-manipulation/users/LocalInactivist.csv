movies,ffa11t5,t3_eshinf,1579725733.0,"Consider [New Jack City](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102526/). It starred unknowns, most of whom had never done a major film role: Ice-T, Wesley Snipes, Chris Rock, Vanessa Williams, etc. A decade later that would be a dream cast, but in 1991 the biggest star in the cast was Judd Nelson (The Breakfast Club). Additionally, it was director Mario Van Peebles’ first film. Finally, the film itself was controversial. People were actually afraid that there would be gang violence at the cineplex and worried over whether it was safe to go see New Jack City.

Thirty years later, the film holds up. The cast is brilliant, packed with future stars. The story is timeless, the script tight, and the settings gritty. The only possible issue is that it’s unmistakably New York City circa 1991. You have to accept the hip hop fashion of the time and realize that the characters were sporting bleeding-edge style. If it looks a bit silly now, such is the nature of fashion."

I suppose Pintsize could aspire to a new chassis that’s more mobile and has better hands, but he seems happy as he is. That’s a good thing. As Faye once pointed out, Pintsize would be a problem if he were even twice his current size. With his penchant for chaos he could cause some real damage if he was as big as Momo or May, let alone Bubbles. That would mean incarceration. His current antics are easily forgivable and punishable by giving him a timeout in the freezer.

My three best friends took radically different paths. One is a dot-com millionaire. He retired at 35. Another is a musician and sound engineer. He plays medium-sized clubs in LA and does sound for video games. The first time he headlined at the Whiskey a Go-Go I just about burst from pride. He was headlining the same club where everyone from The Doors to X to Guns’n’Roses cut their teeth. He’s just started headlining in Vegas and we’re all really proud of him.

The third just couldn’t get it together after high school. He tried technical school for a few months then dropped out. That was the last time he actually tried to do anything. He bummed around the Seattle punk scene for about a decade doing meth and little else. Eventually he pushed everyone away with his toxic attitude.

Key point: it wasn’t that he couldn’t fit comfortably, he literally couldn’t squeeze into a single airline seat. 

A few years ago Kevin Smith ran into a similar problem. He always bought two seats on Southwest because it was more comfortable and because he didn’t want to inconvenience whoever sat next to him. A flight attendant took offense and had him removed from the plane because she claimed he was a safety risk. Kevin tweeted his story (#toofattofly) and it went viral in minutes. Southwest Airlines started backpedaling immediately, saying they hadn’t removed him for being fat, but couldn’t come up with an explanation for why they booted him."

Our President is the very definition of buffoon. He’s like the drunkest guy at the party everyone’s laughing at, right up until he pulls out a gun. By contrast, Trudeau is seen as a man of class and intelligence and Canada as an oasis of sanity. You’re complaining that Trudeau wants to take in more refugees? Trump is putting children in cages. 

Dude, you have no idea how good you have it. When America hit (and caused) the Great Recession, banks failing, millions of people losing their homes, the economy on the verge of collapse, Canada was relatively unscathed. Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy in America. Middle class people with good jobs often have to save up or travel abroad for medical treatment because they can’t afford to be treated in America. The cost of a college education has doubled in the last 20 years. It can take decades to pay off your student loans. 

If you’re that concerned about refugees, brace yourself. The American economy is turning and if Trump is re-elected you may find a whole lot of scared Americans on your doorstep."

AMA,fej4lu9,t1_feia9dn,1579156701.0,"No, he didn’t. He was accused of killing a Sergeant, not a general. He was 15 years old when he was taken into custody, held at Guantanamo for ten years, tortured by the American and Canadian military, denied medical treatment and legal counsel, and his civil rights violated. Moreover, no one actually saw him throw the grenade. He was the only one who survived the attack by US forces, so they took a severely wounded 15-year-old kid into custody and tried him for war crimes. 

The issue isn’t whether or not Omar Khadr was affiliated with al-Qaeda, it’s that the US and Canadian governments tortured a teenager for ten years despite no actual evidence that he did anything. The Canadian military violated some of the core principles of the Canadian Charter. The American military also violated America’s most basic ideals, but we decided that’s ok as long as you do it in another country.

So. Is that it? Frankly, Canadians aren’t that great at scandals. You guys lost it over the Mayor of Toronto being a drunk. America has a judge who was caught literally selling children to for-profit prisons. You guys got your long-johns in a twist over Tim Horton’s cutting employee breaks. One of our President’s campaign advisors was just busted for child pornography *for the second time*. You may have issues with Mr. Trudeau but you don’t know how good you have it.
