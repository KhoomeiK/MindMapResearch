AskReddit,ff8gmbe,t3_erzmpz,1579677585.0,Target! My boyfriend loathes taking me to Target because I get caught up in every aisle. I’ll be like “I just need makeup wipes” and come home with the whole dollar section.

DunderMifflin,ff7vqte,t1_ff7vcyn,1579659505.0,She has a larger photo on the table so it’s not her.
DunderMifflin,ff7vnsd,t1_ff7veo9,1579659447.0,No it later says that Toby was drawn by Michael and that he wasn’t even supposed to on the table because he’s corporate and doesn’t get part of the raise.
AskMen,ff5mi8s,t3_erlbbu,1579600272.0,"I went on a date with a couple (long story) and we met up at the bar. We hit it off and we were really vibin and in hour in, a blind guy asks to sit at our table. We accept because we know that to him it’s sounds more like we’re friends hanging out rather than three people on a date. He was highly intoxicated and kept making the same self deprecating blind jokes over and over again and interrupting everyone. I don’t blame the couple for the bad experience I still talk to them but it was definitely a weird ass date."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fe62i03,t1_fe61a03,1578880318.0,I guess I could’ve told him he was being creepy but I’m an introverted person and I was waaay too anxious to function.
wholesomememes,fdxqxhb,t1_fdxqvow,1578772016.0,This one specifically was a prototype
wholesomememes,fdxg7wv,t1_fdx7clx,1578768444.0,I was scrolling through his Instagram feed and saw it. I was like “this is meme material” haha
wholesomememes,fdx95bb,t1_fdx8xjs,1578766503.0,I’m just asking because it could also be seen as a joke. I wasn’t trying to roast you or anything. Just genuinely trying to clarify.

wholesomememes,fdwv34b,t1_fdwttxe,1578762603.0,Wow dude. With that attitude you’ll never have a relationship as good and healthy as mine. Good luck dude.
wholesomememes,fdwur69,t1_fdws39r,1578762493.0,"We’re in an open relationship! Like I mentioned earlier, I met him right after high school when I moved to college (literally the first week of college) and we’ve been inseparable since. But we felt like we missed out on college dating  (we are basically each other’s first real relationship) so we decided to open up our relationship. He knows. He’s commented on some of those tinder posts I believe. I actually show him first and ask him where to post because he’s been on Reddit forever and he introduced me to it."
wholesomememes,fdwrj20,t1_fdwpttv,1578761651.0,We would but we love playing on our PS4s. And each are in different rooms.
wholesomememes,fdwr624,t1_fdwpjw2,1578761529.0,"LMAO I’m sorry you’re so bitter and can’t understand that
- you can watch your SO play video games and joke about being needy for affection. And he most definitely showers me with affection. 
- my boyfriend finds me  interesting, and maybe that’s why we’re on our fourth year of being together. 
- memes are a JOKE. Obviously I’m not getting mad at him for playing games on his free time because I’m also playing games on my free time. 
Dude, get a life."
wholesomememes,fdwp4kl,t1_fdwnrvz,1578760988.0,I have one.
wholesomememes,fdwoplb,t1_fdwodde,1578760915.0,Why so bitter? This is a wholesome subreddit.
wholesomememes,fdwobs7,t1_fdwm2pa,1578760803.0,"Thank you! I’m like that because I get cold easily and he gives off so much warmth and because growing up my mom couldn’t go to sleep if we weren’t home yet (when I went out with friends). She just wanted to know I was home safe and I feel like having my boyfriend in bed next to be gives me a sense of security. He always “jet-packs” me in order to fall asleep. 
I wish you and your wife well!"
wholesomememes,fdwnk7j,t1_fdwn6ze,1578760528.0,Thank you! I wish you the same!
wholesomememes,fdwnibi,t1_fdwn1ka,1578760508.0,He’s been trying to get gold guns on MW and losing track of time. Sometimes he’ll come to bed at 5 am or when he realizes the suns coming up lmao. He’s a nerd. I love him.  I did the same whenever I started playing Stardew Valley.
wholesomememes,fdwn71o,t1_fdw111p,1578760393.0,"We live with roommates. My tv and console are in our bedroom, and his tv and console is used in the living room for gaming, Netflix and  other things. He’ll walk to our room just to kiss my forehead in between rounds and talks to me."
wholesomememes,fdwl35j,t1_fdwk8pf,1578759830.0,Yes! irl it’s nice to watch your SO enjoy themselves. It makes me happy knowing that we share a common love for video games. And in reality it’s a bonding experience for us and hopefully our children later on in life
wholesomememes,fdwgwp0,t1_fdwglr9,1578758555.0,You just made a gamer girl cry tears of joy
wholesomememes,fdwg5wi,t1_fdvg3w1,1578758325.0,I’m sorry friend :( that was not my intention at all
wholesomememes,fdwdrkk,t1_fdwd5y3,1578757647.0,OMG! I’m playing it for the first time ever! I started a few days ago! So much to do! So much to see! I do sometimes play rainbow 6 siege instead but I’m loving Skyrim so far.
wholesomememes,fdv2sy7,t3_en5l8o,1578742522.0,"I actually do play video games. I posted this meme because he’ll play as I’m getting ready for bed and I’m watching him play MW  and he’s killing it but I’m
cold and need his warmth to go to bed


EDIT: I’m a girl lmao. And my boyfriend and I work late so when we come home, we immediately play video games to destress from our service job. He likes to play until super late and I’m falling asleep by three am. If I’m up playing games he’ll kiss my forehead in between rounds or we’re on PS4 voice chat just enjoying our dumb sighs and “FUCK YEAHS”. He loves me very much and he’s not prioritizing games over me, rather I love watching him do the thing he introduced me to (that I extremely love) and I understand that that’s his free time and he’ll come to bed eventually.

Edit 2: holy shit this blew up!! Thank you!!! I hope all my fellow gamers find love out there! I battled with depression most of my life and didn’t think I would make it to 22. I struggled but kept moving forward and right out of high school I met the one. It gets better and the one for you is out there. If y’all ever need a friend to talk to my inbox is open.

Edit 3: I didn’t think I’d have to say this but obviously this is a joke and I’m not actually getting mad at my boyfriend for playing video games instead of cuddling me. Sometimes the roles are reversed and he wants to cuddle and watch Netflix while I’m playing rainbow 6. We just joke about being needy for affection even though we literally spend almost every waking moment together. We’re each other’s best friend. Stop saying rude stuff about my relationship on a wholesome subreddit. That’s wack af."
