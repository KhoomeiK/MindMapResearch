If you kicked the absolute hell out of a guy who was savagely beating an old woman like the guy in the video, any decent lawyer would be able to get you off as long as you take it to a jury trial. It's easy to justify that to a jury.

But if you killed him, that's another situation. If he died in the process, like if you kicked him to get him off the woman and he died from it, you'd probably be fine. But if the guy was unconscious and you stomped his face to mush and he died, you'd be fucked."

In September of 2015 Obama wanted to look into Viktor Shokin, a corrupt prosecutor who has proven upper level ties to the Russian mob and government. The reason was because Obama didn't want to give money to Ukraine if it would go to a government official that was in the Russian mob.

So he sent Biden over there to check it out, only on a fact finding mission. He had no official power to make decisions in one way or another.

So Biden goes in, turns some screws, and the question comes up of aid. He said, with no official authority, ""You aren't getting aid unless Shokin is removed. Call them [The State department], they'll tell you the same thing.""

The difference between the two things is Biden was warning them about what would happen if they kept dragging their feet.

What Trump did was extortion."

I myself have no existence; I am but a dream--your dream, a creature of your imagination. In a moment you will have realized this, then you will banish me from your visions and I shall dissolve into the nothingness out of which you made me

In a little while you will be alone in shoreless space, to wander its limitless solitudes without friend or comrade forever—for you will remain a thought, the only existent thought, and by your nature inextinguishable, indestructible. But I, your poor servant, have revealed you to yourself and set you free. Dream other dreams, and better!

Strange! that you should not have suspected years ago—centuries, ages, eons, ago!—for you have existed, companionless, through all the eternities.

Strange, indeed, that you should not have suspected that your universe and its contents were only dreams, visions, fiction! Strange, because they are so frankly and hysterically insane—like all dreams: a God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet preferred to make bad ones; who could have made every one of them happy, yet never made a single happy one; who made them prize their bitter life, yet stingily cut it short; who gave his angels eternal happiness unearned, yet required his other children to earn it; who gave his angels painless lives, yet cursed his other children with biting miseries and maladies of mind and body; who mouths justice and invented hell—mouths mercy and invented hell—mouths Golden Rules, and forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and invented hell; who mouths morals to other people and has none himself; who frowns upon crimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally, with altogether divine obtuseness, invites a poor, abused slave to worship him!

You perceive, now, that these things are all impossible except in a dream. You perceive that they are pure and puerile insanities, the silly creations of an imagination that is not conscious of its freaks—in a word, that they are a dream, and you the maker of it. The dream-marks are all present; you should have recognized them earlier.

It is true, that which I have revealed to you; there is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all a dream—a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And you are but a thought—a vagrant thought, a useless thought, a homeless thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities!”"
