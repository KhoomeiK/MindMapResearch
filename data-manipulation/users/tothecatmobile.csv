Picking the right frequencies to distort is essential for bass, and the only EQ on the crayon is a tilt EQ, which ignores the frequencies you want to boost, your mids.

Find a way to boost between 500Hz and 800Hz, such as an EQ pedal to put before the crayon, or another pedal that has a tone control, and you'll find it will sound much better with a full band.
