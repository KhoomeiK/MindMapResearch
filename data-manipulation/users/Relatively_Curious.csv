my skin used to be pretty sturdy. one layer of face lotion was plenty, even in the most brutal, dry winter season. But nowadays, i really need dry season specific face lotion. otherwise, i can feel my skin begging for mercy. dr jart face lotion makes them say merci.   


i guess it makes sense if im like 60 or something, but im only 31. i feel like im still too young to experience this sudden change in skin condition."
AskEngineers,fc4629q,t3_efyq5x,1577407591.0,"Immigrant from Asia. 

Spoke zero English when I moved with just my mom and my siblings (my dad stayed behind). 

They always told me I gotta do good in school to not waste their sacrifice. They also told me that math is the only thing I can excel until I get better at English. So they were particularly strict with my math grade. 

Well, I couldnâ€™t read lengthy math problems, so I didnâ€™t do all the well. They said they should just me back. Thatâ€™s when i developed major mental health issues and got really insecure and quite. 

I got better at English over time, and when I started doing better, teachers really tried help me out even though I didnâ€™t English all that well. I came up with equations that drew cool graphs and showed them to the teachers. They always loved it and wanted to go over the equations. 

With that and music, I started making a lot more friends, and thatâ€™s when I really excelled. I think itâ€™s the encouragement from others and myself that pushed me. I was lucky enough that I took ap calc in junior year and multi variable and linear algebra in my senior year."
personalfinance,fbz8am9,t1_fbx1knj,1577238208.0,"Iâ€™m applying now for the upcoming fall semester. 

Once I get into school, i plan on getting a part time job. The actual amount will depend on where I go for school. There are some regions where I can get a decent part time job that would get me decent money. (Current industry related Technician)
In most areas, I can get a job as a retailer for the industry that Iâ€™m in. With my background, itd be easy to get a job, and Iâ€™d imagine $15-20/hr. 

I have a small emergency fund of $2k. I also have Roth, which I havenâ€™t checked since last year. Iâ€™d imagine close to $10k. 

I might get a small raise (5-10%) at work, if Iâ€™m not getting fired immediately. Thatâ€™s sort of up in the air at the moment. I told my boss that I plan on staying at the company, but heâ€™s not too happy with me at the moment."
