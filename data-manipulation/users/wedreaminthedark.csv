AskReddit,fexnm3q,t3_eqsnp0,1579433696.0,"Star Trek, Star Trek Voyager in particular. I sometimes walked in the room my sister was watching it(Voyager and DS9 I think) and stayed there doing my thing thus watching bits of episodes but not really paying attention. I thought it was ridiculous, the uniforms, the dramatic speeches, (Janeways awful hair bun), the technobubbble.  Without being conscious of it I stayed longer and longer each time(it was a weekly tradition, during the week she would watch it on her phone, she was allowed to watch it on the big TV Fridays until I had to admit to mself that I like watching whole episodes. Voyager is my favourite(I watched the whole thing 3 times, and a good chunk of episodes 4 times), DS9 is very good as well(with very well written female characters), TNG is often hit or miss in writing quality, it takes itself too seriously and does their female characters in my opinion dirty. (oh how I'm gonna get downvoted for this). I even watched adored Discovery especially the second season. It was a great experience watching it while it aired. The Star Trek Franchise is my greatest TV show obsession and something which I'll always return too."

But my anecdotal experience is not nearly enough to make these kind of broad statements."
SuicideWatch,fa4w64s,t1_f9zu4qx,1575809062.0,I kind of do. I just feel so lonely. I have no friends at university and I think there's something wrong with me. People don't wanna be friends with me. I'm afraid that's never gonna change.
