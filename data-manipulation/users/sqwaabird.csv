instant_regret,ff4gs73,t1_ff43tn3,1579563242.0,":D. Yeah you can do some dumb stuff with 120v. It's typically pretty forgiving. Especially when it's in a house and on a 10-15a breaker.  Leather gloves and a blanket on her lap... Pretty good PPE actually.. my three issue are she was touching the hot conductor directly, the wire could have been unplugged, and she was positioned such that the wire could have fallen on her."
instant_regret,ff422dk,t1_ff3xbd5,1579553849.0,"There is proper PPE for what she's doing. ""Hot"" work on electrical circuits, for my utility company goes as high as 26kV. Some go up to 70kV I think. The PPE is basically rated for an arc flash between a hot source making contact with ground or another phase."

AskReddit,fdrky48,t1_fdqeush,1578685977.0,"I had one customer experience that was bad enough that I'll never go back. It's a shame. If you shop in-store it's fantastic, but their online & delivery fell so flat on their face with me that I just can't. 
I moved and bought a bunch of furniture and had it delivered. Some stuff was missing. Their phone system was dead, it would literally hang up on me after saying there is high call volume. 50+ calls over a week hung up on. There isn't a posted email to contact. The website form to submit a ticket, was bugged and I couldn't actually send one in. I physically went to a store and they told me I have to call. I called in front of customer service and had the system hang up on me. Still turned away. I had to dispute the charge on my credit card to have them contact me. Took them 4 months to come pick up their stuff. Didn't even offer an apology."

personalfinance,fcyk6o0,t3_ejkkyw,1578081484.0,"Uhh... Depends on how well you think the stock will perform versus the other.
Assuming they both perform the same, the first one sounds better, going over 15% Into a single company is not advisable as your job and your net worth will all be dependent on your company. A lot of eggs in one basket. Your portfolio diversity will be terrible.  
Also how long do you have to hold it, are they publicly traded and liquid? Or are they private and a startup?"

But also considering that taxes will probably go up by the time you retire... Meaning a Roth IRA has a benefit there.  
It's honestly complex, different per person, and a toss in the dark.  
I'm personally doing a mix but leaning towards Roth. Until the temporary Trump tax cuts end in 3 more years, stick to Roth then reassess."

personalfinance,fcjm990,t3_ehj1rv,1577693560.0,"Sounds like your employer is screwing you over unintentionally. Whatever system they had set up was dependent on that one person that left.  
Anyhoo... you have two options... Option 2...get your own healthcare through
Healthcare.gov. as you're losing your coverage, you probably qualify to still enroll anyway for 2020..  
Option 1. Go without coverage for a few weeks and risk it with your employer.  
Not having coverage is a scary thing indeed. But you supposedly have 60 days after losing coverage to sign up on healthcare.gov... so... Going with option 1, then resorting to option 2 after another week or two isn't such a bad idea.  
Also when you see the cost of it... Just breathe and know you're not alone."
