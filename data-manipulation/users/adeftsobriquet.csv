dating_advice,ffgw7kt,t3_etftpk,1579916629.0,"I have been blocked and ghosted by my boyfriend of 3 years. We broke up and stayed friends for a year. In the weeks leading up to him blocking me we were having a lot of sex, then after a couple days of no response, and a couple calls going straight to voicemail, I realized what had happened. This happened 3 weeks ago and I'm having such a hard time getting over it. I really thought we would be friends forever. But if he didn't want that, and just wanted to move on he should have told me. Worst of all I miss him so much.

I have been thinking about writing him a letter. I'm not sure if it's even worth the time though. I'm just so shocked that someone I cared about so much, and who I thought cared about me, could just cut me off so easily and so abruptly."

Wellthatsucks,fe7oyg2,t1_fe6t8hb,1578917518.0,I was also just thinking how ugly and boring that looks. Why would someone spend their money to make their bathroom a dull yellow colour with a chunky and childish looking shower rack.

He used to complain to me about his other friends ignoring his messages and he would tell me I'm the only person he could count on. Then he does this. He is so selfish. He meant so much to me though, this hurts so much."
relationships,fdfqyam,t1_fdff8of,1578368058.0,"You are right. This just really sucks. If he were to tell me that he wants to stop seeing each other for a while, I would be fine with that. I just wish he would tell me. He was my best friend for 4 years. I dis so much for him and he still means the world to me. This is so excruciatingly painful. I honestly don’t know what to do with myself. I feel so empty and hurt."
Jennamarbles,fd69idq,t1_fd69c2t,1578187582.0,Hahaha! I remember Jefree saying that anything that he hasn’t opened goes to women’s shelters. But yeah it is INSANE how much stuff they accumulate from pr/ fan mail
Jennamarbles,fd692ol,t1_fd4pvlu,1578187395.0,"Or maybe because it's just too much stuff. I get stressed out when I have too much stuff and I love getting rid of things, because I really like to keep everything organized. Sometimes I'll watch fan mail unboxing videos and think ""wtf are they gonna do with all that crap."" They probobly throw a lot of it out which contributes a lot to the immense amount of waste and garbage we create, which is you know, not good for the earth."

One day I felt terrible and went to smoke a bit so I could feel better, then the pain and nausea immediately got way worse right after I smoked."

The more negative side of me sometimes thinks ""fuck off"" and that these people are just looking for praise for saying something pretty meaningless."

TooAfraidToAsk,fc4zvvz,t3_eg1l06,1577435915.0,"Im Canadian but I believe our culture, especially in this aspect is extremely similar. My family has always taken our shoes off in the house, but if a guest drops by we don’t mind if they keep their shoes on (as long as they don’t walk upstairs on the carpet) my mom and I have slippers with hard soles to walk around the house in, but other family members don’t do that. But I have friends who’s family’s don’t take off their shoes, for whatever reason.
It really varies from house to house. But I much prefer to be just in socks or my house shoes."
