witcher,ffumhpy,t1_ffum1os,1580245086.0,"mm rereading your comment you def weren't going for that, I think I've just seen that term so often in a negative context that it's kinda tainted it which is a weird realization on my part.

\+1 on the getting people who don't normally to speak up."
dankmemes,ffukbd0,t1_ffujmp5,1580243758.0,It's only a year old? feels like I saw it a lot longer ago
witcher,ffuj1kt,t1_ffugihk,1580242994.0,">needs more of an alternative point of view than the usual straight white male!

Is it weird that I find this mildly biting? Has 'straight white male' really gotten negative connotations now? Maybe it's the 'usual' bit at the beginning making it sound vanilla in a not nice sense. Or more likely that it's so rarely used in a non-derogatory sense. Weird times.

In any case, I don't think there's a shortage of people saying they'd sleep with Cavill in this thread. Straight white male or not lmao"
nba,ffudz94,t1_ffudl2y,1580239958.0,shrug that was what came up when I googled. Looking at it a bit more it seems to bounce between 5th to 11th depending on what site ranks it and when.
nba,ffu9exp,t1_ffu06mt,1580237254.0,"It is the 5th most popular site in America which means more people visit it than Instagram, Twitter, eBay, LinkedIn, or Netflix.

So you are essentially saying the majority of Americans are like this, which could be true lol, but I kinda doubt it with an employment rate of 97%.

Reddit is more like facebook in demo these days, shit got main stream."
