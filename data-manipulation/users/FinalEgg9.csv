AmItheAsshole,fe8esgd,t1_fe7vwtc,1578925383.0,"Yeah, I was raised in the same way. I was once grounded for sleeping in an hour later than my family on a Sunday (waking up at 9:30 rather than 8:30!) and my punishment was to have the battery removed from my phone. I had a part-time job at the time (I was 16) so I simply went to the market on my lunch break and bought a replacement battery.

I had no control over what I watched as a child (I wasn’t even allowed to change the TV channel, so had to accept what was on) so as a result, I am *extremely* out of the loop on a lot of films and TV. I’ve never seen South Park, Futurama, American Dad, Home Alone, the vast majority of Christmas films, Dirty Dancing, LOTR, Malcolm in the Middle, Fresh Prince (I’d never even heard of it until a few years ago), and basically every big part of 90s/2000s pop culture. I’ve only seen ten minutes of Friends. I’ve seen maybe a handful of Simpsons episodes (enough to get the premise, but that’s it). It’s a huge gap in my knowledge that I’m very conscious of."
