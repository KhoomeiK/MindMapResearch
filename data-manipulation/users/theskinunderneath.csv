SuicideWatch,fddwsod,t1_fddcuh3,1578325891.0,"if your friend is 15 and the the school counselor will notice potentially dangerous behaviour, selfharming or suicidal tendencies, she has to tell the parents, it is the law, as well as it is her job to try and get her other professional help, like you said she did. So I would not recommend telling the counselor. 

However, what I would do is try to spend more time with your friend, try to occupy her with alot of activities thaz you can do together, go for walks, go see attractions, play sports or whatever it is that would occupy her mind and make her not think as much about what is going on inside of her head as well as it will give her a potentional glimpse of hope for better days. It is all about showing her that life too can be beautiful and enjoyable and those kinf of activities that would be fun for her will trigger more serotonin and dopamine, basically the ones that pills are meant to adhance, it’s somewhat a natural remedy. 

Make her feel not alone amd wanted, do not invade her privacy like her mother does because that is what is only gonna make her feel even worse, untrusted and stupid. I know it might be triggering for some people due to fear of her doing something harmful to her self but just dont push it too far:)

And when talking about the selfharm, that is something that has to come naturally to her. Selfharm is an addiction like any other and if the addict doesnt want to be helped, no one can ever help them, it will only make them hurt themselves in less visible areas or such. So you cannot really affect this part of her behaviour even though i bet you wish, i would too :/

Nevertheless, it all goes hand in hand so if you can make sure that one aspect of her problems seems easier to bear, it is going to make all the difference. And I know it may seem like the time is running out but DO NOT RUSH, that is very important not to do. Even in professional care, feeling being rushed doesnt feel good but they can afford it because the person is in a safe place under supervision, which you cannot offer, Take it slow and it will make her want to see what the next day has to bring and offer as well if one day, just one day was somewhat okay out of the ordinary:) Be there for your friend no matter what, even if she pushes you away. Do not give into her defense mechanisms and listen to what she doesn’t say with words:) Hope this helps and that your friend will be here to see tomorrow."

selfharm,fcr6ur1,t3_eifokp,1577897630.0,"once when i was sleeping my mum took a picture of my arm, she literally walked into my room to check my body for cuts and i was very cautious so i would make sure my sleeves wouldnt roll up when i would sleep so i would put rubberbands on my wrists to hold it tightly. But my sleep used to be very deep so i had no idea and felt nothing so her rolling the sleeves up didnt wake me up. the next say she confronted me saying she knows im doing it again and i said no. she then said she took pictures as proof because i was really shutting her off so she knew i would never show her no matter the force and fights. I never saw the pictures because i never felt more humiliated in my life before that. As a defense mwchanism i went all mad and started shouting real bad and saying nasty things and then i ran away. It was fucking hard trying to process everything that had just happened, especially ackowledging the fact i would have to return eventually and walk by her, look her in the eye and conversate. But eventually, the memory faded, with some time of course. But i have not trusted my mother since and something inside of me broke. It has been 5 years since and even though the memory faded, i still think about it at times and get real anxious considering the deep footstep it has left. Pure humiliation. Its like rape in a way..

Edit: i understand her reasons and the worries and desperation she was probably feeling that led her to the act but nevertheless it does not excuse any of it."

SuicideWatch,fckvwk3,t1_fckveln,1577734332.0,"i see :( i think it is because she doesnt take it seriously enough and has no idea anout the thoughts running through your head. That is why so many people cry for help in the most destructive ways but i want you to know there is another way. You two should have a talk where you adress the point straight away and tell her just how acute and serious this is. you cannot be afraid of hurting her feelings by saying something she wouldnt like to hear because if you do not draw an accurate picture of your issues so she sees it the way that you do, it may go on like this further and suicide will hurt ger forever whilst the converstation would hurt her only until you would get better. You got this!"
SuicideWatch,fckv8ap,t3_ehqius,1577733919.0,"leaving this world wouldnt help you. It would, in fact, have the complete opposite effect. You want for your family to understand you, accept you and help you. It is hard, especially when people are ignorant with this topic but it doesnt mean that it can never change. Do you think you would be able to tell the closest person to you in your family what is going on with you between 2 sets of eyes?"
SuicideWatch,fckuoil,t1_fckuahe,1577733578.0,"some people dont. or some people fear life more than they fear death. Relief and escape is found through so so many things! Do you have anything that could maybe do that for you? 

And companionship wise, you are right, it is extremely rare to have that kind of person in your circle. That is why you slowly should learn how to be able to exist and survive on your own for the time being. As sad as that sounds and as scary as it sounds, it isnt that bad afterall(:"
SuicideWatch,fcktwoa,t3_ehqf9x,1577733099.0,"if you fear death, it isn’t what you yearn for.
