bestoflegaladvice,fg013qq,t1_ffzthg0,1580397867.0,"Dogs have crazy bite force, a GSD ranks in at about 230lbs. So if the dog actually felt threatened and delivered a full bite, a couple broken bones in th hand isn't surprising at all."
dogs,ffywg19,t1_ffys88t,1580356858.0,"You might find success in teaching your dog how to settle. Tethered decompression is a great way to get them used to the idea of doing nothing calmly. Pacing and whining is a physical manifestation of anxiety, so you're right about that! Teaching my GSD how to settle through tethered decompression stopped the pacing and whining in its tracts. We've since paired it with a place command, so he knows that when he's asked to go on his raised bed it's his opportunity to chill out."
dogs,ffyw446,t3_evsa92,1580356621.0,"You can absolutely still get out and enjoy winter with your dog! If there's fresh snow, I play frisbee with my GSD (balls tend to disappear and can't be found until the spring lol). 
Indoors you can do nose work, there's tons of resources on YouTube. I also really like soaking my dog's kibble in water, stuffing a couple Kong's, then freezing them. I can keep my dog occupied for a coupl hours that way without adding any extra lbs. 
One last thing, teach your GSD an ""off"" switch. He needs to learn to get comfortable with doing nothing. Pacing is just a physical manifestation of anxiety. Practice tethered decompression, teach him a place command and practice this everyday. However, an ""off switch"" is not a substitute for adequate exercise!! It's complementary."
copywriting,ffuoc9q,t1_ffulek7,1580246162.0,"Sorry, I use salary interchangeably with earnings. Even if it is possible to make that kind of money as a freelance copywriter, let's not kid ourselves and extrapolate that as achievable earnings for the vast majority of writers who are just starting out. Your experience is just that, anecdotal. It's not meant as a slight to you by any means."
copywriting,fftncjj,t1_fftl429,1580224891.0,"I mean good for you, but it's not a realistic salary for most people in the industry with less than 5 years of experience, and that's being generous."
TrollXChromosomes,ffsnd7a,t3_euwzjo,1580186168.0,"I had to mute Kobe on twitter because I couldn't take all the slander that was getting thrown at that poor girl, it was just too painful. I feel awful for his daughters who lost their dad, by all accounts he was an amazing father... but he will never be a great man in my eyes for rapping that teenager."
90DayFiance,ffr669b,t1_ffqpusn,1580151308.0,"The vast majority of people in abusive relationships or who suffer from drug addiction are not sex workers. Those types of circumstances do not discriminate, having a blue collar or white collar job does not protect you from that. 

You're entitled to an informed opinion, and yours is clearly just spreading hurtful stereotypes. 

We see women being sexualized every day - in media, at work/school. But when a woman profits from her own sexualization through sex work you choose to degrade them. Nobody has an issue with the exploitation of women until women are the ones in control of it."

interestingasfuck,ffnd20n,t1_ffmyvmj,1580064472.0,"Good grief you're such a joy killer. These dogs are having a great time, you're just too wrapped up in your toxic worldview to acknowledge it."
Dogtraining,ffnci7r,t1_ffmfy8o,1580064258.0,"Tether him so there's no need for you to manually redirect him. You may need to sacrifice a chair leg to anchor him to. I would really encourage you to give a tethered decompression a good try, it works wonders for dogs who are continuously operating in an aroused state (which your dog is). 
You may want to consider getting him a muzzle if he really is biting so hard. Working through this behaviour may be easier on you sanity wise if he doesn't have the ability to use you as a chew toy to redirect his frustration! Good luck!"
Dogtraining,ffmfm4l,t1_ffm47f4,1580053963.0,"All of this! 

To add to this, a great way to teach an off switch is tethered decompression. Ask your dog to go on his bed while he has a flat collar and leash on. Set yourself up with your phone to browse Reddit. Your dog is not allowed to step off the bed, if he does, gently correct him with the leash and guide him back to the bed (no talking to him!). It could take over an hour, but your goal is for him to decompress and fall asleep.   Eventually you can pair this with the place command, and he'll now that when asked to go on his bed it's an opportunity to chill out."
puppy101,ff6klkv,t1_ff56n8o,1579629202.0,"That's awesome, good job! It's exhausting having to be so consistent while setting structure and boundaries with them while they're being little naughty demons, but all that patience pays off in the end!"
puppy101,fenrr8i,t1_fenfzk9,1579289812.0,"It was definitely grating because his barking was relentless if we weren't paying attention to him. Then again we understood that he was a baby and just needed to learn how to behave politely! It took 3 months of patience and constant correction (we would put him in a timeout anytime he attention barked), but now he doesn't attention bark anymore! A shock collar to curb barking just seems lazy, why get an animal if you don't want to put the time into teaching it manners? And on a young puppy, it's just cruel."
