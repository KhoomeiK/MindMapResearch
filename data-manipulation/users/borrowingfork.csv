interestingasfuck,fexql20,t3_eqtocl,1579434762.0,If these are juvenile eeltail catfish my hot tip is not to put your hand anywhere near them or you'll need a lot of morphine very soon after.
BipolarReddit,fexpabj,t1_feuym08,1579434319.0,"Stabilising means that I am able to work a full day without needing to go to bed (I work at home), or get anxious or lose distraction, properly stable means I can do that for a week if I want to. Over the last year I've only been stable like this for the most recent few weeks to a month. Before that I thought I was better and kept having trouble with the medication I was being prescribed but realise now that I was just still experiencing the illness. At my worst I was in bed most of every day and having panic attacks in the evening and not being able to keep my eyes open past 8pm. I couldn't concentrate on anything either. I thought it was meds but now realise how bad I was. It took ages to get through that."
tipofmyjoystick,feucdcz,t1_fepmo1h,1579385246.0,Yes! Nice work
tipofmyjoystick,feuccbt,t1_fepmitj,1579385238.0,Thankyou yes!
BipolarReddit,fem5437,t3_ep4i1y,1579240075.0,"I would give it a little bit of time to get up to an effective dose and then see how you feel. For me, until I actually stablised with the help of medication and all the non-med stuff I lost every creative bone in my body, so about a full year of feeling like you describe. Once I stabilised and I found the right meds (which include lamogitrine for me) my creativity has come back in a much better, more productive way. I now create things that I finish! Who would have thought! I also have a range of different creative things going on at the same time, like life drawing, sewing, illustrating, patch making and jewelery making. I would never have been able to do all of that before I was stable because I would never have finished any of the thoughts. ETA I also write for a living and getting stable has helped that aspect a lot. I write reports and these days I don't get as stressed and am able to finish things much more than before when I was not stable. This included when my meds were kicking in. Until the meds levelled off things were still bad."
interestingasfuck,fel1ldf,t3_epirzu,1579212082.0,Was hoping there is a subreddit called /r/dronezone with stuff like this
bipolar2,febbhdm,t3_eo2wnx,1578957141.0,How many other psychs have you got an opinion from? I would suggest your first step is an appointment in which you work towards a formal diagnosis. That way you can stop second guessing what might or might not be true and work on what's true for you.
bipolar,feba13a,t3_eo9xly,1578956774.0,"You're really good! If you seriously think about selling them, my friend has done that and she says that for the time put into them she doesn't get much money back. There are so many commercial amigarumi around now that people don't want to spend much money on them. So maybe think of something that people can't get already - like pet portraits like the other commenter mentioned.

If you decide to leave school to do this, at least do some maths to figure out how many you would need to make and sell each week to pay the bills."
bipolar2,fdzv4zv,t3_endf4j,1578796530.0,That scares me it's so real and I can't bring myself to do it even though my bedroom is actually ok right now I know it will just continue to get worse because I can't stay on top of it. Nice work.
veganfitness,fdlrr24,t1_fdjyapd,1578530932.0,"I only started loving it when I met my trainer at this really amazing small gym. No advertising, heavy metal pumping, very muscly men, very intimidating. Then I walk in and the guys are all like 'nice to meet you', shaking hands etc and there are as many women and everyone is awesome and supportive and there aren't many people so everyone kind of knows each other and not one time at all have I ever felt like I'm the largest person there even though I am. Instead I get a lot of 'jealous' comments about how much weight I can lift because I'm twice the size of a lot of the other girls. Woo!"
veganfitness,fdj8qhx,t1_fdj2iq6,1578461690.0,"FWIW i know BMI is the standard upon how we measure fatness but the categories were changed over time due in part to pressure from medical corps who had lots of cash funding to push their diet medicine. So one year some of us were normal, the next year the same people with the same measurements would have been considered overweight. Point being that figure stresses us out in so many ways but it only does one thing which is tell us how much space we are taking up. Give yourself permission to  find another way of determining your goals for your wellbeing, physical appearance and fitness because BMI is not good for any of those things."
veganfitness,fdj8e9y,t3_eljmor,1578461394.0,oh i'm very fat and at the gym and vegan and am a beginner powerlifter and none of it makes sense but i just love it and don't care. You be yourself and everyone else will follow.
bipolar,fdik30n,t1_fdgu2ki,1578444671.0,That's exactly how I feel. Hmm.
bipolar,fdgi0kv,t1_fdgbmtm,1578397646.0,"Fun part is that I just spent the evening having a hefty in-depth convo with a fellow music lover as well. At least it wasn't all one-sided.

Fine. Off to bed for me."
bipolar,fdghxlx,t1_fdg8alk,1578397545.0,I've been banned from Eliot Smith because I can't handle it at all even though I love it
istebrak,fb94rf3,t3_ebzhub,1576629335.0,"It looks really nice for day 5! I am in no way qualified for this, but looking from a distance there is a little bit of an outline effect going on from ears down around the outside of the face."
