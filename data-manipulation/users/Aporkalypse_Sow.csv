Though, the feds have finally started arresting people all over the state. So maybe there's hope for the future.
There was just a story about a 6'3"" 200 pound sack of shit deputy, that manhandled a 125 pound Grandma. And he is the son of the former Chief of police, who should have gone to prison for corruption. But got off, because his own deputies didn't have cause to pull him over, when they found the evidence.
