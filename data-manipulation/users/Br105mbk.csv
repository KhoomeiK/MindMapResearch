I rarely ever wear a seatbelt. I’ve been in minor and major accidents. Literally never had the mindset of “I won’t get in an accident”. My mindset is that I don’t want to wear it."

YouShouldKnow,fffry0r,t1_fffg0f2,1579890491.0,In my experience as a machinist there’s been a lot of women that work in quality control. Women are very good at paying attention to details.

Documentaries,ff4kmom,t1_ff4e1av,1579565903.0,"It’s really not easy to find doctors that are comfortable/confident changing and modifying medications for ADD in my experience. My mother found the one that was great when I was a little kid. Im sure it helped that she was also a doc. Even when he retired I asked him to refer me to someone, he said the closest one he’d recommend was a whole state away from me. 

Good luck. Try goodrx coupons if you haven’t yet."
Documentaries,ff4jw80,t1_ff4c00f,1579565388.0,Adderall is a medication prescribed for adhd. I’ve taken many different meds for adhd. Adderall being one of those and the one I’ve been taking the longest. I’ve specifically taken adderall everyday for probably 20 years now. Just because I don’t abuse it doesn’t mean I have no experience using the drug.
Documentaries,ff4bzb2,t1_ff49lgi,1579560039.0,"I really dislike the IR. I haven’t slept well since I started taking it. I’m tired everyday and sleep like shit now. Probably average 4-5hrs of sleep per night and never feel rested. 

When I was on XR I slept great. I could fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake up easily. It was very easy to “turn my brain off” to sleep. For me I think I noticed a lot less of the anti social side effects on XR. Multi tasking might have been more difficult but it was easier to clearly think about single tasks. 

My longtime doc that specialized in adhd always adjusted my meds, dose, and times I should take them. When he retired I started getting them from my general doc, like the one I go to if I get sick or something. She’s cool with me asking to try different meds or dosages which is nice and all, but I’m not a doctor... I need to find another specialist. It makes me so angry that the insurance companies doc could force me to change meds. That fuck has never met me or seen (all of)my medical records."

I don’t know anyone that’s ever used adderall to a point of addiction. Definitely know people that would use it for college. Only shit I witnessed friends get really addicted to was coke and heroin. Some friends still use, some don’t, some are dead, ones still in prison, two are out of prison. I don’t know if I was really sheltered. Granted I only tried pot a handful of times, I was around drug use a lot."

Documentaries,ff41dd0,t1_ff3z66f,1579553417.0,I mean I’ve read probably 10 books written by doctors about add/adhd. Just googled it and it says people that don’t need it and take very high doses of it can become addicted. Also says when you need it and stick to the prescribed dose that it’s not addictive. Guess I’ve never seen a book about abusing adderall before.

entitledparents,fezrkk7,t1_fexv4g0,1579460746.0,"I had one that sort of did.... a couple years ago after a night out with friends my carbon monoxide detector started going off at 2:30am. I was pretty intoxicated and didn’t want to call 911, so I called the closest fire station to my house and went outside with my dog to wait. 1 fireman came out in an suv without lights/sirens not making a huge scene. Walked around the house with a detector, no unsafe levels. Then he checked out my detector that was going off. Evidently the detectors are only good for about ten years and they sometimes go off when they stop working.

Last company was a platinum level caterpillar supplier, which means 99% or better performance minimum.(on time and no non-conformance issues) That’s the type of delivery performance I’ve been used to for most of my career. This shits crazy, seems like a bad way to do business to me."

EngineeringPorn,fek3rpa,t1_fejcgx0,1579191990.0,"Most of them technically don’t. I think the fastest lathe I’ve ever worked on had a 9,000rpm spindle. But at the center of the part the spindle speed should essentially be infinite. 

We always set a max spindle speed when using CSS. Mainly so the part doesn’t come out, but also because most spindles don’t ramp up speed fast enough towards the center. If you leave the max set really high, most machines will dwell while waiting for the spindle to slow back down, it’s a waste of time."
