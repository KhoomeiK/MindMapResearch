The point is that this is not an actually effective strategy. The enemy team just dumped every ult they had into a team fight, off point, that they probably could have won with a single ult. Instead they burned it all, totally starving themselves in the ult economy and setting themselves up for a total wipe the next time your team pushes.

This is easily one most circle-jerkey subs on reddit, and all of reddit is pretty bad for that. You people need to get off the bandwagon, shut up and think for five goddamn seconds."
