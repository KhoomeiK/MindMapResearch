AskReddit,ffctg0q,t3_esr647,1579806905.0,"This is going to come off wrong, probably. I needed to vent this!

I manage a grocery store. Whenever we hire someone that struggles with a cognitive disability, I always feel so driven to help them feel confident and get better at their job. Some people are dealt a difficult hand in life and deserve extra attention and patience, imo. 

Recent example: I found out that one of our employees (Dissociative Identity Disorder) is living in her car. She kept it quiet, and reached out to me one day about it. I found her a   place to live nearby (decent fixed income housing) and she asked me if I'd set up a meeting with the leasing office. Fingers were crossed; she was focused and ready!

She didn't show up to the meeting with the leasing agency. Doesn't show up to work, either now. 

I don't hold it against her, knowing I probably gave her anxiety/ put too much pressure on her? Helping people is hard"

Whatcouldgowrong,fdhjyr8,t1_fdezdej,1578424250.0,"""Tough love"" is a generalization. 

I don't think physical punishment is very effective or good for peoples' mental perceptions in the long run. 

Particularly for people on the spectrum or those with any cognitive disability, simple parenting techniques actually just do more harm. My brother and father are both on the spectrum

In this specific situation, I would say these jaywalkers getting a hefty fine could be considered the ""tough."" The person that reports them is, in an ideal world, the ""love"" aspect. It'll help them improve their future behavior by giving them a negative connotation to that action... theoretically. 

Unfortunately, the reality is usually that they get reported out of hate/ in hopes the persons life gets shittier for their bad decision."

Myself included. 

When I was a kid the ""historical accuracy"" of AOE 1, 2 was pretty irrelevant to me. I really wasn't interested in it being historically rich, I played it because I loved battles. 

The third game in the series was actually my favorite, as I got a little older/ more educated. AOE 3 is a bit more of an historically-oriented game, notably in the campaign. It's almost like historical fiction.

The userbase of this game has grown up a little bit, and I hope the game does the same thing."
