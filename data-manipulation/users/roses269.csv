goats,ffiimgn,t1_ffi71vw,1579974757.0,They could also try stanchioning the mom for milking and letting the kids drink off her.  The farm I volunteer at successfully rejoined a calf and cow recently doing that.
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffeyex1,t1_ffen0tl,1579870346.0,"If you look really closely the front feathers aren’t feathers, they’re stuffed animal fur.  It’s a really good likeness for a toucan though!"
AskReddit,ff8q0yj,t1_ff7rbrm,1579691187.0,Try getting a satin nightcap.  It’ll help keep your hair from getting too messed up while you sleep.
goats,ff4pap0,t1_ff4h5ng,1579569176.0,That one goat on the boulder didn’t try to make a jump for it?
NatureIsFuckingLit,ff25bv2,t1_ff1z5v4,1579494232.0,Fun fact!  The berkshires are actually a continuation of the green mountains.
WTF,fec9vha,t1_fe9q8jp,1578969250.0,It’s called a herd for a reason.
WTF,fec9tq2,t1_fe8y57w,1578969223.0,I thought this looked familiar!
Eyebleach,fe4imzr,t1_fe4ifqf,1578859723.0,"Very true, but many people say cow when they should say cattle."
Eyebleach,fe4icjy,t1_fe43tmn,1578859591.0,Might be heifers or steers as well.
Eyebleach,fe4i0nj,t1_fe28r4y,1578859539.0,Cows usually grow a bit more of a coat in the winter and their internal temp is about 105.  If you feel their actual skin under snowy or wet hair it’s still super warm.
tippytaps,fdky93f,t1_fdi28ac,1578513629.0,If it makes you feel better some cows are kept for a long time.  I've known milking cows who are around 14 years old.  I also knew a cow who had about a two year retirement from milking before she was put down due to lameness.   She wasn't beefed out though (I swear that's the term for it) just put into the compost pile.
tippytaps,fdkm6ve,t1_fdjdk3y,1578506439.0,So I have question about this.  What’s your opinion on cats and dogs?  Because other than the last two points you’re basically describing cats and dogs.
tippytaps,fdkcjqf,t1_fdjy1b6,1578500999.0,Either you're the same guy I argued with another time or ya'll are getting your info from the same place because you're using the same phrasing and sentence structure.  The farm I described in my other comment is an actual place.  Part of ethical meat eating would be shutting down factory farms and returning to having smaller farms where animals can be raised humanely.
tippytaps,fdjwtww,t1_fdjo1gc,1578490043.0,You have so obviously never been around cattle.
tippytaps,fdjwr46,t1_fdixhoz,1578489977.0,And better land quality!
tippytaps,fdjwp8t,t1_fdjdk3y,1578489931.0,"There are ways to ethically and humanely raise cows so that they are the grazing animals they’re meant to be.  I know that doesn’t happen in most farms and I am very against factory and industrial farms, but your stance just makes people not listen.  At the farm I volunteer at the calves stay with their moms, the cows have acres of pasture.

Cows in heat will mount each other because cows in heat want to be bred.  Many farms breed their cows in the fall so the cows are trying to mount each other in the winter and slipping on ice.  

Also cows raised on pasture and allowed to live the way they would in the wild help sequester carbon.  

I eat meat and I eat vegan food as well.  All you’re doing is making people hate vegans and vegetarians and then they’ll never take the steps to eat more ethical meat."
tippytaps,fdiif3j,t1_fdihmo3,1578443619.0,"Yea, it frustrates me when people can’t see that there’s a way to humanely grow and slaughter animals.  I think the biggest issue is that there’s even a meat industry.  You can raise animals humanely on factory farms because they’re not being given enough room or attention or love."
tippytaps,fdigpw0,t1_fdi8fpz,1578442521.0,How many farm animals have you actually been around in your life?  Or slaughters?
goats,fdigmfd,t1_fdi12pj,1578442458.0,Aww like a plastic tag or a tattoo? I’ve seen lamanchas with no ears even though the ones with small ears are way more common.
tippytaps,fdigikg,t1_fdib76p,1578442388.0,"I think part of the issue too is whenever I mention humane ways to raise cattle on posts like this I get downvoted by people who are completely anti-meat.  And barns aren’t dumb, they’re needed for shelter, storage, and milking.  And animal shouldn’t live in a pen in a barn like many dairy cows unfortunately do.  At the farm I volunteer at the cows sleep outside unless it’s really cold or raining then they’ll come in.  But they really like being out in the pasture."
tippytaps,fdhr6uk,t1_fdh6fz4,1578428572.0,"Depending on where you live try to find a local farm that raises their cattle humanely.  Also, if you have to buy at the store try to see if you can find beef that's grass-fed and pasture raised."
happycowgifs,fdhqofy,t1_fdfgakg,1578428277.0,"Yep, there's no way in hell cattle, goats, or sheep should be taught to do this.  It's dangerous behavior that can get someone really hurt."
tippytaps,fdhqd7v,t1_fdhpkas,1578428096.0,Fun fact: Cows are often bred in the fall so they don't go into heat in the winter.  Because when they're in heat they friggin' mount each other and are more likely to slip on ice and break a leg.
tippytaps,fdhq608,t1_fdh34mp,1578427976.0,Depends on how the cow is raised.  The cows I know have a large pastures with pine trees to scratch themselves on and get plenty of scratches from adults and children.  Most cows are raised in a fucked up ways and it breaks my heart when they just live in a barn.  They're meant to be in a pasture grazing to their heart's content!
goats,fdh6xnq,t1_fdguzz0,1578416702.0,For some reason I thought she was a dwarf goat given the perspective.  Is she a full size boer?  The baby goats at the farm I volunteer at got a bit too fat this summer and the Jenny Craig diet plan doesn't seem to be helping them much either.
goats,fdgoxd7,t3_el3pc6,1578404397.0,I’m uncomfortable with how fat that goat is.
goats,fdgoo5y,t1_fdgjye5,1578404177.0,It’s a LaMancha.  They don’t have ears and it’s creepy.
goats,fddnsls,t3_ekrd7u,1578318967.0,Aww that white one that stayed back just wanted love.
goats,fcy8ylr,t1_fcxuwvt,1578076525.0,"Yay ducks who live with goats!  The one at the farm I work at is named hank.  He totally eats breakfast with the goats and sleeps with them, it’s adorable."
toastme,fcp2gkl,t3_ei4aw2,1577848427.0,You can do it!
FuckMyShitUp,fbgzcg6,t1_fbfpzup,1576862042.0,the braids are probably weaved in too tightly.
