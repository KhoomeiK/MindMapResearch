Just co-exist, living with somebody doesn't mean you have to be friends with them. There are tons of people who are just acquaintances with their roommates. If you do truly find them unbearable, it'd be best for all parties to keep contact to the minimum necessary to get by."
nottheonion,fdke2ey,t1_fdkbl4r,1578501903.0,I've been told that they have one supply chain for their Cincinnati/Dayton/Columbus locations and a different supply chain for everywhere else plus the canned stuff you buy in stores.
college,fda3bwg,t3_ekehjt,1578241163.0,I don't think that's entirely true. Business and Education aren't STEM but you don't see many people calling those useless.
college,fcxm6xx,t3_ejeuio,1578066284.0,"My vote goes to UIUC. In my opinion, going to a specific school solely because of a single majoring offering is always kinda questionable because so many students change their majors at some point. That is extra relevant considering you're not even all that set on accounting *right now*, the chances of you still being interested in an accounting major three years from now are very far from 100%."
college,fcuv6pb,t3_ej0whp,1577989196.0,"From what I understand Penn State, Pitt, and Temple are basically just private universities that receive a small stipend from the state in exchange for a tuition discount for PA residents. The ""real"" public universities in PA are the PASSHE schools, which have their own problems as you've noticed.  
  
Definitely a shitty situation. We get a lot of Pennsylvania students coming to Ohio for college because they find our schools a better value, even accounting for the OOS surcharge."
college,fcssdg3,t3_eipeu5,1577923902.0,"It depends. If you're reasonably proficient at CS and at the very least don't *hate* it, it might be worth giving it a shot. It's a very very good place to be right now. Yeah, you probably won't be top of your class or a rockstar at work if you don't have a passion for it. But you don't really need to be either; even mediocre CS grads are getting paid more than the average working adult straight out of school, and the jobs are generally pretty easy to get and low stress.  
  
Don't think about it as ""CS major"" vs ""Physics major"", think about it as ""job you will realistically have as a CS grad"" vs ""job you will realistically have as a Physics grad""."
college,fcl4lt2,t1_fcjdzfl,1577739692.0,"FWIW my school has this but they're not super useful because:  
  
* They strip out the comments, leaving you with only the numerical averages  
  
* The numbers seem to be biased upwards, I think because the questions themselves are a bit biased. Even the infamously terrible professors are getting 2.5-3 out of 5 stars."
college,fckdbrr,t1_fcgwuqg,1577722775.0,"I think it does depend on what school OP is going to. Some schools, especially smaller ones, do actually have very homogeneous student bodies and if that's the case and you're not fitting in, might as well get out while you can because it's not going to get better. But if OP is already at Big State University, there is absolutely a non-party crowd already - they just need to find it."
college,fcazvrc,t3_egodsp,1577579900.0,"Nope, never have, for the same reasons as you. Always away from my college friends and have little interest in reconnecting with the people I considered friends in high school."
