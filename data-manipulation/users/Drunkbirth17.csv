AskReddit,fg1ldv5,t3_ewcpzl,1580429186.0,"Went camping with friends. Friend was watching her 3 year old and my 3 year old while I cooked everyone dinner. I asked her to keep them out of my tent. She let them in the tent, because she ""didnt think that was a good rule, and kids should be allowed to play"". 

The kids, unsupervised in the tent while she was outside, ate what we (at first) thought were 20 multivitamins apiece. She didn't think it was a medical concern. She refused to apologize. I freaked the fuck out. Months go by, and I reached out to her a couple of times over 6 months to see if she could understand why I still needed an apology, and to try to work it out. She kept calling me a bad friend. Sometimes I worry I have been.

We had been very close for 10 years. I miss the friendship of her and her husband very much. If I see either one of them again I might put them through a wall."

AskReddit,ffw0glr,t3_evhs4p,1580279276.0,"The 5 that have helped me grow and feel most alive:

**Essays First Series by Emerson**. Beautiful purple flowing examinations of how to live a good life and find joy and meaning. Enlightenment values with some frontier values mixed in. Humane and slightly odd. Intoxicating. 

**Unweaving the Rainbow by Richard Dawkins**. A refutation of the idea that science destroys beautiful mysteries, which ends up being a celebration of both beauty and science. Richard Dawkins has real writing craft.

**Stories of Your Life by Ted Chiang**. The best short fiction I've ever read. Intellectually informed sci fi, tightly written. Each story stays with you and expands your sense of what is possible.

**Lying by Sam Harris**. An injunction to never lie, which turns out improbably to be amazingly sound and realistic advice. He has answers to every counterpoint, and scrubbing white lies from my life (as best I have been able to) has made my professional, interpersonal, and inner life so much easier and better. I was shocked at the power of the transformation. Really try this book out, its short. 

**Doing Good Better by MacHaskill**. A good door into a movement to find practical ways to maximize one's positive impact in the world. Idealism meets realism. Electric."
