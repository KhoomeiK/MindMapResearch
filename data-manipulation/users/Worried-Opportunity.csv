Personally, I didn't see it as romantic until someone pointed it out....and then all the clues lead back to it. 

The same neckbeard philosophy that says Finn and Rey needed to get together is the same attitude that says just being friendly to a guy or girl means they owe you a romantic relationship/sex/etc. Sure that's how we wish it worked, but love is more complex than that. 

Plus in that last movie they threw every available woman, including a new one, at Finn. He only really cared about his original BFF's opinion (Rey), and besides that stuck to his ""bro."" 

Plus, this isnt even Earth... I'm willing to bet a galaxy where Lando can be sexually attracted to bots wouldnt even bat an eye at a homosexual couple. 
Not really related but it stuck with me from Doctor Who where future humans just looking to get laid so everybody hooks up when you find a fellow human. Captain Jack Harkness had no hang ups and I'll be damned if I let Disney/China tell me to have them when looking at two people. Lol"
