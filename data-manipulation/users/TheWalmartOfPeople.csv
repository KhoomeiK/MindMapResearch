asktransgender,fez16si,t1_fexiid0,1579452953.0,"Holy fuck thank you! That description of inserting yourself into the only kind of gay relationship that you are exposed to really resonates with me. I still think that I'm probably gonna end up looking for a queerplatonic relationship as opposed to a romantic one, but... yeah... I tend to imagine myself as a dude's, like, best friend but a little bit more. Especially when it's clear that we're Males because we do Male things together because we're Men lmaoooooo. (Which is SAD because I absolutely do not know how to do Traditional Masculine Things because I wasn't raised as a boy and have horrible hand eye coordination.) Like, yeah. We're really good friends and sometimes we have sex. Cool. You know, normal guy things. 

One other thing in your answer I related to: I've always been attracted to femme dudes a bit more, and I think it's like being a short dude attracted to even shorter people: it makes me feel like I am more masculine in comparison. Like I could play a masculine role in that relationship. It's pretty tied to gender euphoria for me. If I feel attracted to a masc dude, it is mixed with jealousy 100%."

asktransgender,fewczav,t1_fewchnt,1579408575.0,"Thanks! Basically, I was just kinda looking for experiences of gay trans people and how they experience attraction, or experienced it before they were out. How did they imagine themselves in relationships? How was their attraction different from straight cis people's? I know I can't get someone else to tell me if I'm trans, but nobody really talks about gay trans people or their shared experiences and I'm really confused and I want to know."

traandwagon,fekpsx7,t3_epm2ou,1579205096.0,Libido doesn't need to be correlated to sexual attraction. It's false that all asexual people have low libido: plenty have high sex drive but aren't attracted to anyone in particular. Or vice versa: lots of allosexuals have low libido.

Youniqueamua,fe34fxz,t1_fe28rak,1578845836.0,"Many Americans are mildly dehydrated because they drink a lot of sugar-sweetened drinks, eat a lot of salt, don't exercise enough to really feel thirsty, and don't drink enough pure water. Additionally, some people tend to misinterpret thirst for hunger, so they end up snacking too much and not drinking enough. So a few years ago, doctors sounded the alarm on this problem, and it became woke and healthy to drink a good amount of water! Which is cool!
