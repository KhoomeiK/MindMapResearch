In order for change to happen everyone has to be mandated to do the same thing.  

It's like how North Korea may actually wish it could denuclearize, but realistically speaking we all know that the only thing that would accomplish is a prompt invasion by the US or China.  If there were a god of some sort that could actually effectively denuclearize countries, it'd be a different situation.  

Or how China may wish to have a free and prosperous nation, but that's simply impossible when they have a bloodthirsty US controlling their literal shoreline--every nook and cranny needs to be exploited to secure their existence, including exploiting terrorists and criminals for things as bloody as organ donations, rather than giving them a fair trial.
