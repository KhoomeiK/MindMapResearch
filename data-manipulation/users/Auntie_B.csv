AskReddit,ff5ggxb,t3_ero8mj,1579591801.0,"She'd be disappointed.

I don't drive the car I always wanted, or ride a ducatti (my back wouldn't take a sports bike), I don't have the career I dreamed of, I've moved back to the town I grew up in after being desperate to get out (turns out other places aren't actually better, I did try - the specific places she wanted to live when she grew up), she'd be deeply concerned about my hair being blue (genuinely hated the colour growing up) & be angry about how much weight I've put on (bless her, she thought she was never getting bigger than a size 8), I don't have a horse, and I'm not married to the pop star she adored (I don't think I'd tell her how dramatically my music tastes changed once I discovered metal about a year later, it may be too much for her), and whilst I think my house is fabulous, it's not a castle with a moat and towers in each corner sat between the sea and a forest.

However, that said, I hope that me telling her that it's not what I thought I wanted when I was 13, but I'm happy, would make her feel a bit better, and make it easier for her to get through the tough times."

What other changes have you made?

We've started trying to buy sustainable and reusable things more. Starting with those beeswax wraps instead of clingfilm, but it turns out, we don't use very much clingfilm! They're still in the packet! Need something to replace baking parchment and tin foil more!

Also tried reusable cotton pads, Ave for toner and make up removal, not great for nail polish removal, but picked up one of those tubs with a Sponge in. Stings like a right bastard if you've got even a tiny cut on your finger though! (papercut).

CasualUK,fehbixa,t1_feh9as5,1579113158.0,"Suspect it depends on the registrar.

The important thing is that we don't push it and end up like France where there is an actual banned list, the top name on which, is Nutella."
CasualUK,fegr1to,t1_fegov33,1579100525.0,The registrar is supposed to reject any name that sounds like a title as it could be misleading.
CasualUK,fegmx46,t1_fegmfp4,1579097578.0,"I know, such a disappointment knowing the registrar can just reject it out of hand like that!"
CasualUK,fegl9t7,t1_fegkurw,1579096267.0,"Honestly not sure, I remember it being discussed at the time and common belief was that it was because it was combined with something else (Google says Tiaami). The registrar clearly didn't think it would be confusing to people!"

However, new years resolution is to clear the list. To do that, this week, I'm still reading a little of **War and Peace**, was aiming for a chapter a day, but have missed a few days, but I'll keep plodding on with it. It's not that I'm not enjoying it, some parts are excellent but other parts feel dull by comparison. I'll get there eventually.

I'm also trying to finish my Christmas reading, and want to finish **The Santa Klaus Murder** by Mavis Doriel Hay this week."
CasualUK,feggr1o,t1_feggc5b,1579092226.0,"Don't think it's on the banned list, not sure about Jarl though.

Edit double checked, it's not actually a law with a list, but the registry office will reject any with a ""misleading title"" (Earl, Princess etc), that are offensive (sorry, no sending your little one to school with the name Cunty McBallbag), or likely to cause harm to the child (Google reckons there was a famous case where they rejected the name Cyanide, a few years back, and I know a friend of a friend who works in a registry office allegedly strongly dissuaded a lady from calling her kid Malaria by googling the meaning with her).

So, it entirely depends on a) the registrar and b) how cruel you want to be to your beloved womb fruit."
