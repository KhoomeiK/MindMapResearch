AskReddit,ffosu6u,t1_ffopq3c,1580081289.0,"Okay but this one is a *doozy. (Places have been changed for anonymity)*

This girl I went to university with was *always* a victim in every scenario, but managed to play it off in such a way that everybody started out by genuinely feeling sorry for her and genuinely believing her. People would rush to her side to make sure she was okay, spend all night checking in on her, etc. It seemed like every time we were out together, there would be *something.* Some guy would walk into the room and she would turn to us girls and say something like, ""oh my god, that's my ex, we dated for three years. He's really violent - I can't be here. I'm going to have a panic attack."" And of course all of us wanted her to feel safe, so we would do everything we could to get her safely out of the scenario as she would cry and wail about how much he hurt her in the past. 

She would pull this over and over, each time with a different guy coming into the room at a party, to the point all of us were extremely suspicious. How many guys could she have dated for 2-3 years each? How did they not overlap? She had just moved here from Connecticut, why were her 'ex's at every party she was at? She then pulled this shit again when a guy walked in a room at a party and turned to my friend and said, ""That's a guy I used to date. He sexually assaulted me. I can't be here."" My friends red flags immediately went up in her head - she was like um, he just moved here from India. You've been in Connecticut your whole life. How did you two ever even meet? She waved her off with a literal bawling, ""How can you not believe me?! You're supposed to be my FRIEND!""

But again - this then happened with a guy I was casually seeing. She pulled me aside one day and was like, ""So I've heard you're kind of seeing \[X\]. I just want to let you know that he and I dated for almost two years. He even told me he wanted to marry me and that I was the first girl he ever truly loved. I'm not mad at you or anything for dating him, but I just wanted to let you know."" And of course I felt *terrible,* like dating your friend's serious ex is pretty much a horrible thing for a friend to do. So I talked to the guy about it and I said, ""how could you not tell me that you and her were dating and you almost married her? You know we're friends.""

His jaw nearly hit the floor. He was like ""... worstgurl, we never dated. Never. We made out in a club *ONE TIME* last year. That's it. She's been sending me DMs on insta ever since but I've never once replied."" He showed me everything as proof. 

That's when I knew she was full of bullshit. But her lies kept ramping up and up, and she started accusing nearly every man we knew and every man she ever came in contact with of sexual assault. (Disclaimer: I always take these accusations very seriously and always do everything I can to support and believe the survivor so this is *NOT* something I take lightly at all). 

Then it came out that not only was she LYING about all of it - several men from the club she was the president in came forward and said that she had threatened them in multiple ways (i.e lying in the way she did) if they did not agree to engage in sexual relations with her. . Multiple of the men refused (they were several years younger than her and she was obviously in a position of authority). Most, if not all, of them had witnesses and proof.

She ended up being fired from her position and even briefly arrested. 

I have no idea where she is now."

AskReddit,ffnnust,t1_ffnngde,1580068306.0,"Of course it's just a suggestion and definitely wouldn't work for everyone!

I texted him later being like, ""Hey, I heard you and \[x\] broke up. Are you okay?"" 

He texted back, ""Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?""

I said, ""Good! But I'm here for you if you need anything.""

He changed the topic back to me, and we dropped it. 16 hours later - he was dead. He hung himself behind our high school.

For example, I had gum surgery in April. Had antibiotics. 3 weeks later - I had my wisdom teeth out. Different doctor, so she gave me the same antibiotics as the earlier month.

I've now been with my boyfriend for almost 10 months, and it's been wonderful. So, I can try to give some advice based on my personal experience:

1. Bring it up slowly. As in, not the first date. The first date should be doing something you're comfortable with, so that you won't necessarily spring a panic attack on them without warning. If you have agoraphobia, maybe invite the person over and offer to cook dinner for them. I think I brought it up with my boyfriend on our fifth date. Don't overload the person with all your trauma, all your treatment, all your diagnoses right away. Keep it simple. ""Hey, I don't know how to say this but I feel like it's important that you know - I struggle with my mental health sometimes but I promise you that I'm actively working on it. Some days are bad, and I just want to let you know in advance in case I don't really feel like myself so that you're not caught by surprise. I really appreciate you understanding."" 
2. If you are able to get to a time when you're comfortable telling them, make sure that you continue to be honest and open throughout. It's important that you don't try to hide your mental illness to try to make someone like you because at some point it'll all come out and then it'll just be worse. 
3. This is one that I struggled with the most in the past - *just because somebody does stick around for a bit, doesn't mean that you have to as well.* I found it ***so*** hard to let someone go when they seemed to like me, no matter how bad or toxic they may have been for me, because I was terrified that ""nobody else would be able to look past my flaws"", or something along that same mentality. Just because somebody shows an interest in you doesn't mean they're the ONLY person who will show an interest in you. Don't let yourself settle because that's what you think you're worth. You are WORTH so much, mental illness or not. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to message me! I can try to help as much as possible."

namenerds,fckprdw,t1_fckd3zf,1577730545.0,I have the same feeling towards Angelina! I love the ‘angelic’ connotation but it’s so closely associated to the actress that I could never.

I’d say go for it. Pairing it with a classic name is also a great idea."
namenerds,fccn18a,t1_fcbz85v,1577600295.0,I actually had a friend named Madison (girl) who dated a Madison (boy) and they had a kid together. I was weirdly shocked when they didn’t name their kid Madison as well.

To me, whenever I hear it I always consider it one of the most popular names just because I always knew so many people with it! I grew up calling people “Madison G.” vs “Madison L.”, or something because we always needed their last initial to tell who the heck we were talking about."
