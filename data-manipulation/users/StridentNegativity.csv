I encourage you to look up detransitioners and horror stories before making a decision. It is of course ultimately up to you and may be for the best, but make sure you know what you’re getting into. Don’t just check with people who are pro-transition. 

If you have a lot of additional emotional and psychological problems, transition may not help."

If you don’t mind me asking, what about your upbringing predisposed you to this?

All in all, I’m still hearing a lot of fleeing the gender identity associated with your biology as apposed to approaching femininity. It’s an important difference, IMO. You may not like the results from transitioning, which is a very long process at best and difficult after puberty. The harassment you’re experiencing may only increase."

A bunch of students at my Alma mater take the math classes at community college as “transient” students. Not sure if your school allows that, but it could be something to look into.

You could also potentially work for a non-profit. Tech skills are in need everywhere. Might be two options if you want to help people.

If you still want to create games, what about indie games? What platforms are you interested in? You may not be able to do it full time to support yourself, but it could be a hobby.

If that car had hit me, all of us would have died or walked away with devastating injuries. I fish-tailed hard and almost lost control of the car.

medicalscribe,fdh5htx,t3_el4oe5,1578415810.0,"I just passed my mock solo. I’m not sure if this advice will be location-specific, but this is what I found to be helpful:

1. Keep a chart with all of the patients organized. We list them by initials and CC. This will help with all the tests the docs run and in situations where the doc discharges the patient before you can finish their chart (happens more than you probably think). You can use the initials and CC to locate their chart in whatever system your hospital uses.

2. Do your attestation first whenever you open a chart and knock out anything you can get done without the doc (e.g. smoking cessation).

3. If you have any docs who do their own HPIs, do NOT include any other symptoms you heard the patient describe in the piecemeal HPI sections or ROS. You’re there to put down the doc’s thinking, not yours. Some docs trim off a crap ton of stated complaints to make the HPI suit their suspected diagnosis. Others want all of it. If your notes directly contradict theirs, especially about an important symptom (e.g you have denies SOB but theirs have endorse SOB), ask them.

4. Don’t be afraid to slow the docs down to have them repeat physical exam findings. *Never* guess.

5. If you have them available, double check EKG readings with the image - match the heart rate and/or name. Our docs love to deliver the readings rapid fire, and it’s too easy to mix them up."

Then again, I’ve completely given up on honest, close relationships, so I’m a bit of a lost cause. When I deal with people, crucial information only flows one way - and it’s not from me to them."
SuicideWatch,fdd5xgy,t3_ekomzn,1578296214.0,"GPs are horrible at this shit. They’re just as ignorant as the next person when it comes to mental health. I had a similar experience with mine. Never again. 

And now anxiety is in my health records because I’m an idiot. The look on the providers’ faces like “Oh, fuck, we got another live one now” always kills me.

Also, LMAO at the doc dropping money as the deciding factor in choosing an occupation. Doctors make bank but have one of the highest suicide rates out of any profession. Thinking money will solve all their problems is a mistake they’re good at making over and over."
SuicideWatch,fda0nz3,t1_fda0iqq,1578240357.0,Can you take out loans? It’s dangerous but in this case maybe worth it.
SuicideWatch,fd9znbl,t3_ekbey4,1578239982.0,"I’m so sorry. You say you are at school. Can you cut off your family once and for all and move to campus? All of them sound like a whirlwind of negativity. I don’t think you have a chance in hell to heal with them around. Also take a look at Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families and see if the laundry list of traits they have there might fit you. I can’t recommend the program and support groups enough for people who come from shitty, chaotic families who don’t support them."
Anger,fd9yp3u,t3_ekarmh,1578239689.0,"He wouldn’t let you? It sounds to me like your anger is coming out because you two can’t communicate openly with each other. I think this relationship is going nowhere and that you should leave. He’s only going to use your temper tantrums as leverage to get his way, as he is actively antagonizing you. Let this one go."

CraftBeer,fd9xgpd,t1_fd8vide,1578239148.0,"I actually tried it in IL first because I went to the U of I, though I didn’t get to try it up near ISU, which is the home of the brewery, right? I’m in FL now and can occasionally get it here."
CraftBeer,fd7ly3d,t3_ek6b52,1578206519.0,"Destihl Plum Sour or Wicked Weed Watermelon Dragonfruit Sour. The first was my introduction to sours, and the second is extremely refreshing and easy to drink despite being a sour."
