college,ffnt15j,t1_ffjpr1m,1580070408.0,If you've taken the PSAT you can connect it to your account so it'll know your weak points and give you practice that focus on that. Otherwise you can also take a practice SAT to get the same thing. You can also just study the topics you want without taking a practice one.
college,ffnsti2,t1_ffjpr1m,1580070324.0,If you're planning to study a couple of months before then an hour every like 2 or 3 days should probably be good enough. I did like 2 hours everyday 2 weeks beforehand and got like 25 hours in total.

ucr,feaqc7q,t1_feapkzc,1578951324.0,I did not take it online but I did take it with that professor. His midterms and final are just things from the slides so it's mostly memorization and as long as you watch his lecture it shouldnt be difficult to memorize. This isnt like a science class memorization tho where you need to know all the terms in detail. He also gives a study guide for the final that is really close to his final.
ucr,fe6qkfz,t1_fe6oydm,1578900741.0,Yeah rlst has reading but barely any writing. Think I got like 2 writing assignments and the TA basically gave most people A's on them

college,fdmdoxn,t3_em2al7,1578546561.0,Found mine from a career project we had to do in high school. We had to take an online survey that asked a bunch of questions. Then it gives you some recommended careers based on your interests and I picked one that looked like it made a good amount of money and I took a class in it in high school and ended up liking it so I chose that as my major.

college,fdiyviq,t3_ellz1u,1578454215.0,I think the opposite is true. When I see someone consistently answering the questions I'm like alright that guy knows what hes doing I'll ask him for help if I get stuck and cant make the office hours. I was one of those people for one of my classes and someone reached out to me for help and we became friends
