funny,fcslswa,t1_fcskte9,1577919252.0,"Wow, I'm questioning whether this obtained knowledge of yours on the subject of winning over dancers is due to trial and error or simply researching the topic. ü§£üòÅ From reading your tip, I can see that not seeming desperate is the key, making them be the desperate ones sounds like the second key all while keeping some sort of boundaries to take them home with you."
funny,fcsjot1,t1_fcsikqo,1577917922.0,"I don't do strip clubs, I don't find the idea of throwing what money I have to see some person go around a pole lmao. To each their own entertainment ü•Ç . Thanks for those strip club recommendations I will be sharing them with people who do plan on going to the clubs as my circle of friends just turned 21. I agree Texas roads are a bitch of a hassle. Anyways thanks for answering my question, the name is Cesar, I'm a psych case manager working the downtown area and if we were to cross paths and hold a conversation you'll recognize me. Happy new Decade and here's to making moe üíµ!!!"
funny,fcsgh5k,t1_fcsg0aj,1577916175.0,"I live in Dallas, your life is very different from mines as my life would be from yours. I would like to ask a question. What did you like about Dallas and what didn't you like?"
suicidology,fcsewwa,t3_ehz29t,1577915560.0,That's probably because there is something that's both wanting you to do it and something wanting you not to do it. Yeah the fact that there is pain involved may mean something but what kind of pain?
funny,fcsdnu1,t1_fcsby7d,1577915083.0,Wow you lived an interesting life.

SuicideWatch,fcpcbsw,t1_fcpb2ck,1577858057.0,"I see, during the 8 years you spent alone, you did not care for your wellbeing. Now that you have met your SO, you regret believing that during those 8 years ""you would never meet anyone,"" and you feel as if you're now paying the price. It's very confusing because you thought that when the time comes you would want to die but now you find that you can't do that because it would hurt your SO.  It seems like there is a lot of regret towards not taking care of yourself, but how could you have known what the future would hold?"
SuicideWatch,fcpbux8,t1_fcpb9mq,1577857561.0,"You're experiencing a lot of things, emotions, and challenges; trying to solve all of them at once could be very stressful and like multitasking only cause more stress preventing you from solving them. You have various resources that keep you going such as your parent's, your cat, and have aces to a therapist. Sometimes solving challenges comes easier with the help of other resources or sometimes we can solve them by ourselves. Have a goodnight sleep mate, life is not fair and unfortunately we can not control it we only can control how we deal with it."
SuicideWatch,fcpbl8l,t1_fcpap0r,1577857282.0,Your current goal is to be successful in leaving something behind to be remembered by although it feels selfish You don't feel satisfied however you're life is fine and this is bothering you. It's doesn't feel good to not know why you feel how you feel.
SuicideWatch,fcpb7nk,t1_fcpaoli,1577856896.0,"The negative things in your life seem to be more than the positive, you don't feel content and no matter what you do, nothing seems to change for you. Not knowing what to do to is a very unpleasant feeling."
SuicideWatch,fcpaxlv,t1_fcpadrd,1577856615.0,"You see you're SO as a wonderful being and regret thinking there was no future with him, and doubt you will survive the decade because you did many things to harm your health."
SuicideWatch,fcpakyl,t3_eieaqp,1577856263.0,"Happy New Decade and year :)  
I am sorry you're going through a break up during this time, I can nearly imagine what you must be feeling at this moment. Living would be simpler if we did not have to face constant stressful challenges. You must feel content that you are not wanting to engage in self-harming actions although you're going through a lot at the moment. Although there are some negative things in your life, you have a lot going for you such as starting college, enjoying your job (many people struggle to find a job they enjoy), having cats, buying a new car etc."
SuicideWatch,fcpa3ur,t3_eieap7,1577855778.0,"Hey, happy new Decade, month, and year :). I am sorry to hear you are going through difficulties during this time and feeling alone. You're dealing with your recent health-related events and depression is causing you to feel very sad and feeling like giving up; because of your significant other's importance, you continue to persevere for them?"
SuicideWatch,fcp9ri6,t3_eieayu,1577855412.0,"No, but I do wish I was better off, however, I should not complain because I am doing good. A person can dream?"
SuicideWatch,fcp9plp,t3_eieb1x,1577855353.0,You must feel something good inside for making it this far. Is there anything new you wish to make different from 2019?
SuicideWatch,fcp9mhq,t3_ei3ysm,1577855258.0,If you're not doing anything to solve the issue do you have a say in the subject or to judge others?
