worldnews,fczngd7,t3_ejmfu4,1578105057.0,"Of course Trump did. Remember what Israel means to US capitalists.

Israel might be best described as an outpost of the Pentagon, a kind of giant US military base. And the historical record has much to teach us about US-Israeli relations.

Israel has long played the crucial role of regional enforcer for US corporate interests in the Middle East and elsewhere, a strategic asset that serves as a staging ground for the deployment of American power. In the US war for global hegemony, Israel has repeatedly served as conduit and facilitator when US militarists wanted to bypass Congressional bans such as the Arms Export Control Act and provide weapons and other material resources to nations willing to further the interests of Western capitalist predators even as they engaged in horrific human rights violations. In fact, Israel has served as a US mercenary state for decades. Since the 60's, with CIA supervision and support, Israel has been used to train, arm, and provide intelligence to pro-US dictators and terrorist groups all over the world.

Israel was the primary contact and intermediary between the US and apartheid South Africa for years (where it also trained the death-squad security forces and helped develop their nuclear program). Israel has provided weapons and other military assistance to UNITA and RENAMO terrorists in Angola and Mozambique, to Papa Doc Duvalier, to Zaire during Mobutu's reign, to Liberia under Charles Taylor, to the Burmese generals, to Pinochet's Chile, to Somoza in Nicaragua, and to Argentina during the ""Dirty War"". Israel delivered military aircraft to Indonesia's Suharto during the massacres in East Timor and supplied the napalm dropped on impoverished peasant communities by the Air Force of El Salvador. In Guatemala, under the Rios Montt dictatorship, Israel taught terrorism techniques, assassination, and a ""counterinsurgency"" program based on the Strategic Hamlet operations that the US used in Vietnam. Israel sold arms to Iran during the Iran-Iraq war while the US armed Saddam Hussein of Iraq, a fiendish coordinated plan that meant to maximize casualties on both sides. In Rwanda, Israel supplied the Hutu butchers with small arms before and during the genocide, and began arming the Tutsis immediately afterwards. And this is by no means a complete list.

The USA and Israel share at least one core belief: human beings are nothing but disposable animate objects, and concepts such as morality and justice are useful for propaganda purposes only."
