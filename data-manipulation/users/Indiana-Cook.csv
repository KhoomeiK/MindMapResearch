We went to watch it last night and we both thoroughly enjoyed it, it's a great film and a great ending to an enjoyable trilogy.

Unfortunately, as with any fandom, you get some die hards who would rather see nothing new if it doesn't exactly fit with their head cannon, and hate on anyone that does like it. It's the same with the new Star Trek stuff!

Remember, Star Wars was pretty much relegated to EU stuff while in the hands of Lucas. Just look at what's happened since Disney took over, 5 new films, an amazing (so I've heard, not watched it yet) new original tv show, a fantastic theme park location... Star Wars has never been so alive!!

I'm a Trek and Wars fan and I tell you what, I'd rather have the new stuff than nothing at all."
