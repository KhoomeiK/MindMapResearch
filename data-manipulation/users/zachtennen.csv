nba,ff2x22t,t3_er6l8p,1579527331.0,Becky Hammon is the most attractive female coach in NBA history
nba,ff1j46z,t1_fev521u,1579480023.0,No brainer A and why I ranked them high they deserve it...
nba,ff1iziz,t1_fezpa6a,1579479967.0,Love the way they’re playing but I think it’ll catch up to them.
nba,ff1iu7m,t1_feyz6kv,1579479903.0,I posed it as a question. I didn’t explicitly say “they can’t coexist.”
nba,ff1iq65,t1_fevttfg,1579479853.0,I wasn’t indicating they didn’t. I’m just saying Jokic is a veteran now.
nba,ff1imfy,t1_fevczso,1579479807.0,I typically don’t. I just like using different perspectives.
nbadiscussion,feziao9,t3_eqxkek,1579457656.0,"He might be underrated by some people’s standards but certainly not anyone who knows anything about the NBA. It’s pretty clear to me he’s easily a top 20 player. Recall when Kevin Love was on Minnesota. It wasn’t that easy for him to get all-star recognition until he started recording monster 25 point, 15 rebound type numbers. I think what you’re saying is Minnesota is a small market so he doesn’t get as much attention as someone in LA."
nbadiscussion,feyxycm,t3_eqwbp5,1579451814.0,Damian Lillard isn’t going anywhere. The rumors from before for a significant change would be trading CJ McCollum. He’s also a little bit younger than Lillard and doesn’t have a super max contract. There would be tons of suitors for McCollum and the Blazers would likely be looking for versatility at the forward positions. That’s why they just added Trevor Ariza. I know he’s older now and might not solve the entire problem but those are the type of players they need.
nba,fev5687,t1_fev47vu,1579393214.0,Injury to best player
nbadiscussion,fepifv1,t3_eq38h1,1579321318.0,Why would this matter? You don’t get penalized for having a great team. You actually get rewarded.
dogs,fehkt35,t1_fehh81b,1579118568.0,He’s almost 2 now
dogs,fehkqs3,t1_fehix88,1579118532.0,You’re saying his current behavior comes from the fear he showed as a puppy? Can you tell me more about this please?
nba,fecmi89,t3_eofen0,1578977592.0,He got that 20th rebound with such ease
nbadiscussion,fe4ysex,t3_enrbka,1578864095.0,I’d take Murray for $270 million
nba,fe04t6b,t1_fe04chx,1578803087.0,What is the difference?
nba,fdz63wf,t1_fdyux7z,1578787086.0,Who cares?
nba,fdyqp1m,t1_fdyo7e2,1578782595.0,"They also don’t have the guy they traded for him too...
But I agree."
nba,fdyqh5x,t1_fdylsm1,1578782509.0,"Post I wrote on my blog

aspergers,fdxnpq3,t3_en6pdh,1578770985.0,"Yeah, it seems to be more common these days."
dogs,fdk6xmh,t3_elmrg3,1578497473.0,Bladder cancer? I lost mine at 13 due to that. Very sad.
nba,fdiddy9,t3_el5m5k,1578440360.0,This is nice for you to point out. This doesn’t take anything away from how good he is.
nbadiscussion,fcst6kz,t3_eig1hn,1577924478.0,If the Celtics want to win now then they lose. They would never do that. No chance. Tatum and Brown are already the future and Kemba still has a few great years left.
nba,fcok3xj,t3_eiaadm,1577834234.0,"He has better fundamental guard skills, but no he is not a better defender than Beverley."
nba,fcoj2a3,t3_ei6t37,1577833458.0,Joe Ingles is not to be left off any top 100 players list.
nba,fcoit71,t3_ei5qyy,1577833271.0,"Hachimura has been very solid for a rookie. But as a Wizards fan, I think this time off might not be so bad for him so he can see the game from outside looking in. I think sometimes he falls in love with the somewhat inefficient long two-point shot. I wish him a speedy recovery but I also know we have other guys that can step up (as proven in last night's Miami game)."
nbadiscussion,fcfug80,t3_eguu67,1577633833.0,Better than Steve Francis
nba,fbzas4a,t1_fbyx9dw,1577240511.0,I was referring to the future and what always could happen and basing it on losing four straight in the Semifinals last year. But yes I know Coach Bud is doing a good job monitoring players' minutes.
