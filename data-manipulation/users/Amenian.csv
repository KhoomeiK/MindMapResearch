philosophy,fdrdcru,t1_fdr68zu,1578682927.0,The only part of what I said that doesn’t have a scientific consensus is HDL’s role in clearing up built up LDL cholesterol in your arteries.  LDL cholesterol is universally accepted outside of a few junk science sites to be bad for you.  It is the position of the American Heart Association and most of the scientific community that your body makes all the cholesterol it needs and you don’t need dietary cholesterol.
philosophy,fdr5tng,t1_fdqwo2i,1578679852.0,"Yes, and your body makes enough HDL cholesterol on its own that you don’t need to consume cholesterol.  Meanwhile, you shouldn’t be consuming any LDL cholesterol at all.  Not consuming any dietary cholesterol is a healthy choice, and a smart one for people who have been diagnosed with elevated or high cholesterol.

worldnews,fdo3zn0,t1_fdo23w0,1578598479.0,Yes.  True.  They believed it was an F-14.  They’d recently received intelligence that Iran had outfitted their F-14s in air to ground configuration.  They had strayed into Iranian waters after taking fire from Iranian helicopters.  They requested identification 10 times over both civilian and military channels with no response.  They used a surface to air missile to shoot it down believing they were in imminent danger.

I’m not saying it hasn’t had disastrous consequences down the line, but when judging the motives of a decision you have to do so in the context of the times it was made in.
