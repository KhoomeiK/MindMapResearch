I had to make my own flow charts on how to take a turn, how to run a combat, and how to play the game, and even with those as guides, I wasn't playing a fun game, I was following an algorithm. Most complex modern games have steps in a round where you check for certain conditions, Arkham has a bunch of different conditions you're supposed to just be aware of at all times. It's been redesigned a bit here and there but at its core Arkham comes from a time before games got good.
