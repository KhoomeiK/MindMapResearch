aww,fdotyff,t1_fdoprh9,1578612810.0,Definitely.  I gotta make myself a new username cause I'm definitely bad association these days!
aww,fdotw0c,t1_fdoh4s3,1578612766.0,"Thanks, it might not be him, I haven't seen him in a long time.  But if it is him, I appreciate you passing the message along.  It makes me happy to see him smiling!  :)"
aww,fdoff8g,t1_fdnslt8,1578604069.0,"Dude, he looks like my brother.  Does he have a sister he hasn't spoken to in a year or two? And can you tell him I love him, and I'm glad he looks so happy!"
MadeMeSmile,fdocot1,t3_emb4rz,1578602759.0,"She's teaching her to say ""grandma"", for the curious.  It's super cute.  Then she tells her ""you sign grandma"" and moves her hand, then praises her for doing it.  What's funny, is babies are actually super good at picking up signs, and she will start signing much earlier than a hearing baby starts vocalizing words."
gardening,fd5ubyg,t1_fd5jcbd,1578181601.0,"Thanks, I'm not planning on covering it all, I'd just like it to be a bit more welcoming than the long, narrow patch of barren clay dirt it currently is.  I also don't have a basement, but I do have kids and know that they like space to play!  :)"
gardening,fd5tvv4,t1_fd5gu28,1578181457.0,"I should have included that info, I'm sorry!  The side where I have been building some raised beds gets roughly 8 hours of sunlight in the summer.  I am planning on putting my veggie garden there in the raised beds.  It's the backside I haven't figured out what to do with.  Right now it's a barren 16 ft wide corridor.  It gets about six hours of uninterrupted sun in the summer.  I would prefer something low maintenance, I am planning on putting in a retaining wall about two feet from the fenceline because it's a bit of a slope there, but otherwise I'm kinda unsure what I can do with such a long, narrow area."
exjw,fd2wne8,t1_fd2ji1i,1578152328.0,"I dunno, but I can tell you that I'm all kinds of fucked up when it comes to sex, dating and love.  Between the JW repression and then my exjw ex-husbands continual cheating, I figure I'm pretty much doomed at this point.  This thread is a great idea though!  All you kids leaving, go forth and find your sexuality!  Don't hurt others to do it though, and always use protection!"
Music,fbkckrr,t1_fbj2jdk,1576948233.0,"Oh my god, I can't believe you actually came back and replied!  Thank you and Merry Christmas!"
