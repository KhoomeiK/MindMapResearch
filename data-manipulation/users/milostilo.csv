The issue isn’t whether water should be free for all mankind but the theft of public resources for private (in this case, foreign) profit."

It’s pretty understandable considering how much more we pay for college than Europeans, but it’s killing American liberal arts departments and returning us to the Gilded Age."

AmItheAsshole,fesg4vk,t3_eqh2uf,1579364833.0,"Mild YTA for the book thing. She clearly isn’t interested in making a serious writing effort, she’s just trying to have fun. No ones going to read her self-published Kindle book anyway, so it doesn’t matter if it’s unedited drivel riddled with errors. Tell her it’s great, point out three token spelling errors, give her a nice blurb for the back cover, and rate it 5 stars. Sometimes you need to support peoples’ creative endeavors by letting them spin their wheels and be a cheerleader, not a critic. For the apartment thing, you’re obviously right, but you don’t have to be the one providing the cold dose of reality. Work with an apartment letting agent, who will be a pro at managing her expectations and can help you both find a value you’re happy with. The fact that you’re right about these things doesn’t stop you from being a downer. Sometimes it’s better to bite your tongue and let her find out the harsh realities on her own."

They didn’t come over at a convenient time to introduce themselves and welcome you to the neighborhood, but greeted you with a list of ridiculous demands (Curtains? Seriously, get fucked). If they’re so interested in your property, you could offer to throw a work party where they help you clean up some of the things YOU want to address."

AmItheAsshole,fcvm75s,t3_eiuama,1578005097.0,"Mild YTA. Outdoor gear tends to get worn out or grown out of, but a fancy watch can last generations. She’s trying to give you something more permanent. Accept it graciously, let her see you wear it, and buy yourself a $50 watch to bang up. I think if you sold it you might one day regret that decision, but I doubt you’d regret keeping it. You’ll grow into it and it will develop some patina so it doesn’t feel so overly dressy on you."

Many WASPS were killed trying to fly damaged planes from one air base to another. True heroes who are only recently gaining recognition.

AmItheAsshole,fc5up11,t3_eg8xjk,1577466303.0,"NAH. Maybe studying longer hours worked for your brother, but you’re a different person. Try explaining to your mom that for you, studying is only part of the equation, and can only get you so far; in order to do your best on test day, you need to conquer your anxiety. Come to your mom with a plan for how you intend to do that — meditation, therapy, athletic activity, scheduled rest and relaxation. You guys are both on the same team, you want the same thing (to get into the elite school of your choice). I think if you approach your mom with a strategy it will help show her that you’re taking this seriously and trying your best, and that just looks different for you than it did for your brother. Remember that the SAT is just one part of your application. Best of luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fc3x6qp,t3_eg0w5f,1577400931.0,"YTA, though inadvertently. Someone who wants to be an artist/performer for a living has to constantly deal with naysayers. People are always telling you you’ll never make it, never make any money, you should get a “real job.” She was looking to you for love and support. It would have been real easy to say “you were amazing! I’m sure if you keep dancing like that you’ll make it to Broadway in no time. Is there anything I can do to help?” Instead, what she heard from you is “how will you get good enough to be on Broadway?” It sounds like you were trying to be her coach when she needed a cheerleader. Yes, you were only trying to help, but that’s not what she wanted from you."
