ToolBand,fep7nuh,t1_feoz1yl,1579313972.0,"Great trip report!! Legion is where the “dime flips” for me on this album. It does turn around at CCT and then 7empest let’s you leave with a positive feel. But it is a dark album at the hump. I tried to ride through the album while losing my mind, thinking “they did this on purpose, ride it out” and ended up turning it off during culling voices. I feel your pain man"
ToolBand,fep14vk,t1_feozy93,1579309806.0,"Dude, could have been waaay worse. I seriously thought I was going to hurt myself. I tried to drink some water and nearly inhaled it, literally forgot how to drink water.

APE and PE can potentially be stronger it depends. A cube is not a cube honestly, I’ve had wild swings in potency and I’ve grown quite a few cakes and shoeboxes. Just finished my first tub. It’s not one psychedelic compound in cubes but a couple, psilocybin and psilicin to name top 2. They are kinda like cbd and thc with weed, the ratio of the 2 can create different trips. Then there’s just potency. Unless you clone or isolate on agar  every mushroom is different.

95% of the strains out there are absolutely indistinguishable however so there’s some truth"
ToolBand,feowv0m,t1_feosd5x,1579307131.0,Don’t let my stupid experience ruin it for you. 1) always have a trip sitter. 2) take a test dose if you are the first person to try a particular batch. Especially the Penis envy strains. 3) always have a trip sitter
