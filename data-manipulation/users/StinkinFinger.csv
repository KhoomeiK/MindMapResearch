AskReddit,ffizdx6,t1_ffiaa6q,1579986488.0,"Same here. Both parents. 54 and it still hurts. I made my bi-annual call to my father on Christmas. He told me I turned out the way I did because of my mother, admitting he was never there. I have news for you, Bill, neither was she. I didn’t shed a tear at her funeral and I don’t anticipate doing so at his."

SODA MAKES YOU FAT.

Go be a fat ass, but don’t complain about healthcare if you’re fat. Especially if you drink soda and eat processed food. You’re the biggest problem. Stop eating garbage and drinking sugar.

Just today I had a fat waitress tell me she doesn’t eat vegetables. How long before that fat ass needs a new knee and gets hooked on opiates? What a disgrace."

news,ff305g6,t1_ff2wkx8,1579530092.0,I know someone who was involved in real estate fraud. It was a big operation and 10 or so people went down. All she did was sell the properties. She was convicted because she knew what was going on and participated at all. The legal term is conspiracy. Only this is worse because the “poor bastard” is the one actually breaking the law.

tinnitus,fer3dsv,t1_fepndin,1579349304.0,"I’m not saying you do. I’m very conservative about it. If it’s going to be loud someplace I don’t go. If I’m stuck, as in a loud subway, I put in the earplugs. All they do is take off the edge and no one would notice them because they are so small. Frankly, I wouldn’t care if they did, but they won’t. 

I have 2 kinds of tinnitus. One I’ve had forever (mid-50s) and the other for 6 years. Anything I can do to keep the infernal noise (as Beethoven called it) from getting worse I do."
tinnitus,fer2k0b,t1_feqq568,1579348908.0,"Nevertheless get the earplugs. The pay are tiny do no one can see them and you can still hear with them in. It just takes off the edge. I only use mine probably three times a year. I’m in my mid-50s, so my hearing loss is mild. I don’t want it to get worse. It only takes one loud bar."
tinnitus,fepiabi,t3_eqbdqu,1579321203.0,I don’t risk it. If it’s loud I put in my hi fidelity ear plugs. Not worth the risk.
tinnitus,fepi50c,t3_eqbgl7,1579321099.0,"Talk to your doctor about it immediately. If caught very early on I’ve read that a course of steroids can help. Like weeks early on. 

Either way, try not to let it bother you. When you go about the business of your day you won’t notice it. I know it seems hard to believe, but it’s true and you’ll read it over and over on this sub. Also, since you know you are prone to it protect your hearing at all cost. Get yourself a pair of hi fidelity ear plugs. I like Ear Peace because they come with a key chain so I always have them with me in case I get stuck in a loud bar or theater, etc. 

Good luck."

aspergers,fejw08v,t3_ephfa3,1579187135.0,"I’m 54. Most days are great because I’m high functioning and made good money as a full stack developer. Retired early. Married. Rainbows and butterflies everywhere. Then I say something stupid or awkward and I die inside. Last year I had the worst burnout of my life that lasted months. I’m still not full out of it, but much better. (Trump is NOT helping.)

It has definitely gotten easier over the years as I’ve assembled more and more social rules, but it still feels very mechanical. I’ve come to look at it as a disorder like any other. Most people live extreme lives in one way or another. Would I rather be a single mother? Have MS? Live in a Latin American war zone? Chronic pain?

It helps to keep things in perspective. We all have our yoke to bear."

tinnitus,fejp4ab,t3_epclku,1579182178.0,"Sounds familiar. First of all, get yourself a pair of high fidelity ear plugs. I prefer Ear Peace because it comes on a keychain, so I always have the. Second, remember there are several promising treatments on the way. I have grown used to the cacophony of noises in my head, but after half-century of that light pitched screech and 6 years of tonal madness I’m ready for a little peace and quiet."
