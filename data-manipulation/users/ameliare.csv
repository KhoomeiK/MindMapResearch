Maybe you could discuss a plan for next time if you start to feel anxious again, like somewhere to meet up after you leave or something you can say that lets the other know you need to go?"
Anxiety,ffa1fhe,t1_ffa10g0,1579725953.0,"Yeah I understand that, it feels like I have this frustrated energy in me and I don’t know what to do about it so my body tries to release it itself lmao"
Anxiety,ffa18ti,t3_eshmbu,1579725845.0,"I get that feeling entirely, panic attacks are draining and can throw you off for a while, but here are some things which help me that I’d suggest trying :)

- What helps the most for me is doing something which feels like I’m putting a barrier between the panic attack and the rest of the day. E.g, having a shower and changing clothes immediately after - it’s telling yourself that you’re moving on to another part of the day rather than being stuck in the same state you were before, like you’re washing off the anxiety lol

- You could do something unusual which gives you something to focus on and creates new experiences which overpower the post panic attack feeling. I like to do this by going on a walk on a route I’ve never been before. The fresh air and gentle exercise helps, but so does the new scenery and experience

- After particularly bad panic attacks it’s hard to find the energy to do anything and that’s completely okay. Simple things like sitting outside with a hot drink or laying in bed and watching a film is a much easier, more comfortable way of recovering to let yourself calm down before you continue your day

I hope these help :)"

Not specifically with how I said/did something though, just generally when I feel anxious and it builds up I start having twitches in my neck or legs etc. It feels like my body’s trying to quickly relieve stress or distract me or something?

That’s all great advice though, I’ve managed to stay distracted the last few hours with what you mentioned there so I’ll continue doing so. Thanks for the help :)"

mentalhealth,fejcr40,t1_fegg6ex,1579167540.0,"I’m glad to hear that, honesty is always best in situations like these even if you don’t get the response you hoped for - I hope everything goes well though! Going to the hospital does sound like a good idea though I’m glad you’re considering it, I also think that time away from your boyfriend and family for a couple of days might let you have a clearer view on it all and you can decide what’s best for you without having the external pressure of everyone giving their opinion on it."
depression,feh02mp,t3_ep4kaj,1579106317.0,hello :)
mentalhealth,fegfjwt,t1_fegeox3,1579091061.0,"Even if everyone around you wants you to have it, you’re the one who has to carry the child for 9 months and give birth to it, and I’m sure that if you explain to your boyfriend how you’re feeling about it he’ll completely understand. Your health, physical and mental, is so important, and you can always have a child in a few years when you feel more prepared for it. 

Yeah mental hospitals aren’t the best for everyone, I meant regular hospitals because they often let suicidal people stay for a while, give them some support etc without all the rules and often poor treatment that comes with mental hospitals. Plus you can speak to a nurse or doctor there about the pregnancy and they can help you come to a decision."
mentalhealth,fegey5l,t3_ep1ez1,1579090442.0,"This was honestly quite reassuring because I have the exact same problem and it’s nice to know I’m not alone! It’s so frustrating because a lot of the time I actually wouldn’t mind doing the work at all but it’s like my body won’t let me do it. I think with stuff like this, you probably felt anxious for whatever reason when you were studying for an exam once a while ago or had something bad happen, so your brain associates that with feeling nervous even if there’s no real reason for it. 

In a lot of ways anxiety is just a habit, because you automatically respond to a certain situation the same every time. I read somewhere that it takes 21 days to break a habit (this is what I’m trying to do at the moment) so what I’d suggest is for the next 3 weeks, do everything you can to stop yourself from going away and procrastinating. Maybe study in a different place to usual because that can help sometimes, do it with a friend etc, and even if you only do 10 minutes of studying for an exam (even if you haven’t got an exam coming up for months) for 3 weeks, you should have retrained your brain to respond to it differently. It might be difficult at the start, but it’ll definitely be worth it in the end :)"
mentalhealth,fege2z6,t3_ep1amn,1579089492.0,"It seems like you’re not in the right psychological state to raise a child at the moment, and that’s completely fine! Others might be happy for you, but that’s no reason for them to influence your decision, because this is very personal to you and depends on how ready you feel. Obviously this is entirely your choice and you should go with what you feel is best, but if you don’t feel mentally ready to raise a child, abortion seems like the best option and if you don’t agree with abortion then maybe putting the child into foster care? I’d suggest looking into every option, the main ones being raising the child yourself, abortion and adoption centres, and deciding which one would be best for your health and future. There’s a lot to consider in this but if you trust yourself and your gut then you can make the right decision. 

Also, with regards to mental health please visit the hospital! They can give you some guidance on what to do about the pregnancy if you’re still unsure, and also let you stay for a bit to support you whilst you’re feeling suicidal. You’re coping with a lot right now and it’s understandable that you’re struggling, but you’re incredibly strong and you can keep on fighting, and somewhere like the hospital might help you to do so. 

I wish you the best, take care of yourself as best as you can :)"

Though it does sound like depression it could also have many explanations, but at this stage putting a diagnosis on it isn’t what’s most important. Whatever the reason is, it’s so important to put your mental health first and take all steps necessary to get you to where you want to be. It’s a lot easier said than done, but if you start taking small steps like going to the gym once every couple of weeks etc and slowly building it up (even if you don’t enjoy it at first), you’ll be on the right track to recovering from what you’re going through.

I get a little nervous before emailing people, replying to people I don’t know too well etc, but usually how I cope is to just open the message and reply quickly so I don’t have time to overthink it lol, and also remember how you feel after you email/call people.

This is a completely normal and common thing people struggle with and you’re fully capable of overcoming it, even if it’s uncomfortable for a bit. The fact you’ve already got those reminders for yourself is amazing progress and I’m proud of you for that! Some other things to remember are:

- The person on the other line won’t be nearly as critical of yourself as you are, they’ll be far more focused on themselves
- If you do it, you’ll feel so, so proud of yourself afterwards and taken a big step forwards
- You could practise to yourself/in your head what to say in certain situations which you’re worried about. It’s impossible to predict the whole conversation, but you can have a good idea of what to say about things which might be brought up
- You always have the option to hang up if it gets too much!

It’s completely under your control, and going outside of your comfort zone will be so healthy and make you realise that it’s not as bad as you expect.

My parents are 50 years older than me, and ever since I can remember I’ve been so worried about how I’ll cope with their passing, especially since I’m so incredibly close with them. I suffer with anxiety too and it definitely amplifies these thoughts, and like I do with myself, it’s important to remind yourself that the worries you constantly face is just the anxiety talking and nothing more. Anxiety is loud, and the things it makes you believe overcomes the logical thoughts about things like this. I know it’s hard to believe this, trust me I find it difficult to as well, but they will love and treasure every moment you spend and have spent with them. I guarantee that they will appreciate everything you do, and have countless memories with you. Plus, some people go on to live to 110 and onwards anyway! 

Death is an incredibly hard concept to come to terms with, but you have so much time to accept it and be able to live with these feelings, as do I and everyone else who struggles to cope with it. You could even openly discuss it with your parents, and I’m sure they’ll provide some reassurance for you. And as well as spending some time with your parents, make sure to focus on yourself!

I know how hard it is battling every day with mental illness, and the thought of giving up is so tempting on some days. But think of how you feel on the bearable days, the times you feel happy even if it’s only for a slight moment - are you really willing to let all of that go?

First of all I would really, really recommend seeing a psychologist or getting some counselling for it, professional help is always the right way to go with mental health and they can teach you so many skills on how to cope with it which you can use throughout your life. 

Medication is certainly not the only option, and should be seen as a last resort if you feel like absolutely nothing else is working. Obviously if you see a professional they’ll know which direction to go in with all that, but in most cases they’ll encourage you to try other things like fixes to your lifestyle or CBT, but if you end up taking meds that’s absolutely fine! Despite the side effects, which are rarely as bad as you expect, people have been able to transform their life from the support of meds, so no matter what happens it’ll all be okay.

News sites are over exaggerating the situation for clickbait, obviously memes don’t reflect what’s actually going on/what’s going to happen, and I think all this panic could’ve been avoided. It’s completely understandable that it’s stressing you out, I’m sure a lot of people are feeling exactly the same, but it’s important to remember that there are so many rules and things in place to stop a war from happening - war is the absolute last resort which is most likely going to be avoided. I’d say keep an eye on it but read from reliable sources, and do things to take your mind off it all until it’s all settled :)"

A lot of people don’t know how to respond to things like that, especially from someone they love and care about. Plus, if they’ve never had similar problems it’s hard to know what to say, because they don’t have enough experience with it to know what to say. But still, I’m sorry, I know what that sort of thing feels like and it’s not nice, but there’s over 7 billion people in the world, so even if it takes time it’s not like there’ll ever be a shortage of new, caring friends to make."

Worse

You’ve recognised that there’s an issue and so you’ve already taken the first step, and now it’s about slowly making progress at a comfortable pace to get back to feeling like yourself again. There’s no rush - your mental health should always take priority! Maybe aim to have a shower today, even if you just step in for a few seconds and then get out. You can slowly build it up each day, adding things in like cleaning your room or doing a short workout, at a pace which suits you best.

Then if you feel ready, do the next small step which takes you closer to that end goal, whether that’s the gym or cooking a meal or whatever helps you cope.

Since it is a mental illness I’d suggest something like CBT, retraining your brain to have different associations with children. Every time your brain tries to sexualise them, force yourself to think instead about them in an innocent way, like being a great father to a child of your own. If you block the thoughts this way for long enough, your brain shouldn’t have that sexual response to them anymore, or at least not as strongly."
