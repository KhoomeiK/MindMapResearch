AskReddit,ffh1owj,t1_ffh1iut,1579920733.0,So are you saying that men dont need help or are you saying that we should help men? Hard to tell bc of wording

1. people who say it on the internet probably say it IRL too 

2. things online can also hurt 

3. Does this mean I can say women are pigs online?

4. Why are you defending these people who root for unfairness? 

5. Why the insults about me being a pathetic incel dweeb? You know nothing about me. I could be a 78 year old man about to die. I could also be a 2 year old. Or i could be a 47 year old woman. You dont know anything about me, other than that I support **true** equality and you have something against that."

First ...it was a dream. 

And I'm also a former lucid dreamer (it just started happening naturally ...randomly ...when id realize I was dreaming ...and could then change aspects of the dream to suit my wants ...such as spawning the incomplete car I was trying to build ...and practice driving techniques)

Often times in my dreams ....physics seems to play a huge part (maybe due to my understanding of it ...when I'm driving in a dream ..I seem very aware of decisions I make based on vehicle Dynamics and handling physics ...I even have dreams where I lecture others on better options ...or why their chosen platform is inappropriate)

But my first ...sleep paralysis ...yeah, it started with a dream.

In the dream ..I was with a group of people. We were skiing through some gentle ..very snowy terrain ...but with many paths lined by trees ..but not at a ski resort. 

Like cross country skiing. 

I got seperated from everyone else but I came across ...what I would call a monestary ...the path downhill opened up into a natural culdesac ..that was level ground ...overlooking the mountains beyond ...because this was a cliff face. 

On this site were structures made of dark grey stone blocks ...pillers and stairs and walkways ..leading to a central yard that housed a bell tower in the middle but only 5 meters high.

There were a few ""houses"" but it's clear this is a small enclave ...there's a single house like structure ..off to the right ...also made of stone..with thick fabric doorways. 

I came to a stop and took off my skis and met with a man who was bald, his skin was dark purple. 

I cannot remember what we talked about but he seemed very welcoming and inviting. 

We were both looking off at the mountain range beyond the cliff face ...visibility was for MILES ...

And I saw a mass of rolling clouds ...that was absolutely terrifying ....start washing over the distant land scape. 

The purple man told me ""You must leave .....NOW""

And I got back on my skis and found a path that lead away ..but also down hill of the oncoming storm. 

I went as fast as I could ...feeling like I was doing my best. 

While im almost done with my descent ...the cloud must have caught up to me ...everything became very foggy ..and it was hard to see my environment and the clouds were swirling all around. 

Everything went dark and all I could hear and feel was a whirlwind  .... But I had made it to the bottom. 

Because the wind died down ....and the front had passed. 

Light started returning ... But it was amber or rust colored. Everything was in an orange yellow ...amber ...rust colored hue ...and the air seemed to have ash floating in it ....

I took off my skis because there was no downslope anymore ...and I saw ..I was next to a dirt road that lead uphill and there was another stone structure next to it. 

I looked behind me ...and I heard .....the most awful ...terrible sound .....i can't discribe it it was like a roar ...but also a screech and ...a very intense ringing like very bad tinnitus ....

I saw a creature ....in this ashy ...amber fog ...coming up the road ...which looked very similar to the creature in the 1980s film ""poltergeist"" the one that appears at the top of the stairs ....towards the end of the film ...which sense the mother flying back down the stairs when she goes to try to save her kids. 

Very very long legs ...which bend opposite of a humans ....

And it's mouth was open and howling ...as it came down the road ..

That's when ..I regain ""half consiousness""

In feeling incredible anxiety ....and stress ...and fear ...but I'm now looking at my bed room ... And I happened to be facing the door so I can the light cracking through my door cuz I had left the hall light on ....

I wanted to get to my door ....but the harder I tried To move ....the roaring and buzzing in my ears got worse ...and worse ...I kept trying to get to the door ...but it was like I was covered in a lead blanket ..and the more I TRIED to send signals to my body ...the worse the anxiety ...and the louder the sounds became ...

So I gave up and ended back in my dream ...where I somehow snapped instantly back to the door way of the previous structure I saw...which had a heavy stone door ...which SLID horizontally open when I touched it ..

I then was in darkness when the door closed itself ..but everything was calm and there was no more bad noise ...or roaring ...it was peace ..

But I found no way to reopen it from the inside ....so I lit a match ...and found myself in a room with a pedastole full of carves symbols I didn't understand ..arranged like large buttons ...

And each wall ...was covered with carved symbols and pictograms ...

I remember thinking ...this is it ...There is not enough time for me to solve this ......I'm trapped ...forever ...
