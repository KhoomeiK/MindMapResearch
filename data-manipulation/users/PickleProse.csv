If you kept the pork and ate it after the steak hit your table, it should stay on your bill. If they took the plate, the pork needed to be taken off. 

My first assumption was that the pork was kept on your bill because the server didn’t want to have to go to the manager and have it taken off, in fear of reprimand for bad service and also in fear of having to pay for the wasted pork herself. I don’t know the price per plate, but you paying for it essentially helped the server (kinda like a tip) but she still had to tip out off those sales so I say NAH and you should have asked to speak with the manager about your bill and threw the server some money. But tbh sounds like an awkward situation so I can see your train of thought

Edit: I see the price now, $45 holy shit. Next time, speak to a manager. Unfortunately, mistakes happen and that’s how servers learn to be more careful with what they’re doing.
