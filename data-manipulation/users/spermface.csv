They’re not going straight up from the beginning “I think you’re great and I want to date you”, they want to play it cool and not put themselves out there until they see some signal back or until they think they’ve spent enough time being “friends”, then they want to make a dramatic “confession” of their feelings. It’s totally understandable, but I think the onus needs to lie on the one who wants more than friendship to be clear, rather than needing someone to signal that it’s friends only, which is probably the default they use with everyone they’re not interested in. Whatever standard a guy uses with his guy friends is what he should expect from women too, and he probably doesn’t expect his guy friend to declare whether or not they want gay sex early on, they just assume they don’t until otherwise noted."

TerminallyStupid,fgo6iws,t1_fgmspy8,1580960989.0,"do you mean that they give you $10 + 80 cents for a $10.80 bill, and you give them a dime for no reason?

Or do you mean they give you $11, then decide to give you $.80 so they can get a full dollar back, and you give them...either a dime, which short changes them, or a dollar and a dime, which...no? What?"
AskReddit,fgnm288,t3_ezauxv,1580947785.0,"You’ve probably heard of a classic uppercut to the chin/jaw. Left hook, jab, jab, uppercut, right? DON’T DO IT. Not unless it is a life or death, or professionally monitored and consensual, fight. Upwards blows that tip the head back cause brain injuries; when people die in a barroom brawl of one punch, it is usually because of compression to the brain from a head-whipping punch. Look up the physics of a punch to the head. Don’t go for the dramatic chin shot or you will go to jail.

Oh, and keep your chin down."

That’s not something he should reasonably expect will probably result in death. If we prosecuted that as voluntary manslaughter, American football, MMA and boxing, etc. could not exist at all."

The rights of those sitting in prison because of marijuana are every bit as important as your own rights to freedom, and it’s not a good look to diminish them as being about wanting to smoke weed. Either you support prohibition and many-decades-long jail sentences for possessing banned items like plants and guns, or you don’t."

Either they all agree to pitch in as a team and share the loot, they all agree to charge each other based on contribution and split the loot, or the ones who want to be a team take the job and split the loot, and hire the ones who don’t.

The expected result being that they experiment a bit and then gravitate towards team effort/split."

insaneparents,fgmlr9z,t3_ez9ttb,1580927164.0,"It might be insane, or it might be that their kid is going through an acting out phase where he’s being late on purpose and walking a couple miles, supervised, well-dressed for the weather, isn’t going to do any damage. Sounds like they’re not even making him walk 4 miles...they’re adding more in an he continues to do this. I remember taking the bus at 11. There were times it wasn’t my fault I was late, but there were lots more times it was. Parents couldn’t control my every second in the morning, and if they came back three times to find me re-distracted by TV until I missed the bus, that would definitely be my fault."

BoJackHorseman,fggervg,t1_fgg5bx1,1580760349.0,"If you feel enough anxiety about the possible outcome that it’s distracting you from watching it unfold, you’re not really watching it the way it’s intended, either, and it’s better to just find out the ending so that you can go back and find out how you get there, and really take in all the content. Lots of stories are intentionally told that way; it's not always a deleterious effect on the viewer."
