lol

And inappropriate for a business meeting? Okay. But how much more inappropriate are the men in there, staring at her tits while simultaneously (almost certainly) thinking they have the business edge over her because she’s a woman? They went in underestimating her, and she called them on it in a way that shows she’s not to be trifled with and won’t conform to social norms, pretty much all of which typically put women at a disadvantage."
todayilearned,ffsmm90,t1_ffslnbs,1580185559.0,Yep. Total power move.
todayilearned,ffsmku9,t1_ffs2auw,1580185526.0,It’s a power move. The fact that you didn’t see that is part of its power.

mildlyinteresting,ffscw01,t1_ffs15gv,1580178688.0,"That’s not how this works. You don’t get to declare tests “horseshit” and then demand others prove you wrong. 

If *you* step up with a claim, it’s on *you* to show your evidence. That’s how claims work, especially when your claim is to deny accepted medical practice. 

None of that means you’re wrong, but you don’t get to get all pissy when about folks disagreeing with you when you made a claim and then didn’t back it up."

funny,ffg6gkx,t1_fffd1vb,1579899479.0,Happy to be corrected if I’m wrong. Do you have examples of cases where a statement proven to be true in court still resulted in a victory for a plaintiff in a libel suit?

funny,ffe1gpr,t1_ffdvr7c,1579834235.0,Libel requires the plaintiff to prove the statement to be false. Honesty is 100% relevant. A true statement can never be libelous. And a term like “home wrecker” is flexible enough that it’s even harder to prove its untruth.
funny,ffe1agb,t1_ffdud8p,1579834113.0,"Yeah except the burden would be on the cheaters to prove there was no infidelity. One of the elements of libel is that it has to be untrue, and the burden of proof is on the person bringing the suit. So if the wife has decent evidence, a libel suit isn’t a concern.

PSA don’t give legal advice when you don’t know what you’re talking about."
