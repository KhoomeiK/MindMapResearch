I think when I was younger I dreamed of being a hero, the main character of the story, and yet there's nothing you can do to avoid fading into obscurity just a filler character in some greater ordeal. For me at least I think there is some relief in knowing that I can live my life however I want since it will have no impact regardless. When I'm consumed by that feeling of powerlessness I like to think of it as an opportunity to just let go and to see where the world takes me, after all there's nothing at stake regardless."
SuicideWatch,ff5n5hh,t3_errybz,1579601265.0,I'm in the same boat right now. I think about just driving away in the night and not telling anyone often or spending all of my savings on something ridiculous or just doing something crazy just to break the suffocating monotony and to feel something different. I'm not sure what to do for you or me or if it would even help but I can tell you you're definitely not alone.
SuicideWatch,femfut4,t1_femen5q,1579253325.0,"I've been through a lot of different phases over the years, plenty of ups and downs. The end of high school was the first time I ever seriously considered suicide. I've never really talked about this with anyone in real life but I remember my dad's girlfriend of all people found one of my practice suicide notes, it was more of a call for help than a plan in hindsight. She just hugged me and cried for hours telling me all about her life growing and just talked to me, I didn't say a word the entire time but it meant a lot to me. There were other people in my life that cared but having one person who knew and really saw me and what I felt, meant everything to me. I'll never be able to repay her for that and I haven't talked to her since but I honestly believe that's the reason I'm still alive at this point. It really reminded me of the impact that a single person or dumb insignificant thing can have on someones life and I've always wanted to pay that forward I guess. My life was really good for a while after I had some distance from school and found some hobbies I really loved afterwards, then I found a decent job and I was happy and headed for a positive future. Only recently have things been getting worse again and I can't say if I have the strength to rebound the same way again though honestly. Unfortunately there are no guarantees in life"
SuicideWatch,femewqd,t3_epuqem,1579251912.0,"I think about this from time to time, I don't think there is any one single person who is capable of bringing you back to life and shifting your entire worldview other than maybe yourself. I think that having someone close to you who understands you can certainly help set you on the right path and possibly help you get started, and to support you on your way but I also don't think that it is absolutely necessary to have someone else. That's just my take on it though."
SuicideWatch,femeakn,t3_epxpjc,1579251022.0,"I see a lot of things in this that I really relate to and some similar experiences to mine, you've been through a lot and I can see why you'd feel like everything and everyone is against you. If you ever wanna talk about life, or anime, or anything else I'd be glad to and if not I wish you the best."
SuicideWatch,femdn0x,t3_epwvfr,1579250107.0,"I don't know if it's any consolation but as someone who fairly recently used to be happy and enjoy just existing, remembering that you used to enjoy your hobbies, and hanging out with friends and not dread leaving bed everyday somehow makes it feel worse for me. I still sometimes get forced to participate in my old hobbies, or run into my old friends but I'm just going through the motions at this point and it shows. In some ways I think that having a taste of happiness can make it feel even more bitter once it's all gone. I get it though, the more time that goes by the more faint, numb and distant it all feels sometimes. Stay strong man."
