If you have a plant that you let get *bone dry* inbetween waterings you could get away with the decorative rocks, but be warned."

IndoorGarden,fgr9713,t3_f02sf0,1581041214.0,"Having aquarium gravel on top of potting substrate is usually a no-no for succulents as it encourages root rot. Sometimes it is hard to get them to be stable after repotting because they are very top heavy. 

What I usually do is fill whatever container I'm using about 2/3rds full. Then I make a little nook in the soil, making it deep enough to have the roots hanging down if you hold the plant at the height you want it to be in the pot, but not so deep that you can see the  bottom of the pot. I hold the plant in the nook at the height I want it to be in the pot and with my other hand, gently fill in the nook with extra potting substrate. As you fill towards the top, you can start packing the soil down to make it a little denser. This will help secure the plant. Don't make it too dense, though, or the water will have a hard time getting through all the soil. I make sure to press the dirt around the succulent down after I fill the pot all the way to help with the wobblyness. They will become more set over time as their roots grow.

Please take care of yourselves. If you are taken care of then you can focus on helping people. In the same vein, if you can't take care of yourself, it's okay to ask for help! It's okay to rest, too.

This poor man was either forced into this or so determined he literally worked himself to death. That strength of character is admirable, but yeah he didn't need to work himself *to death*.

That's easy for me to say, though because my country isn't trying to contain a possible pandemic *in it's own country*. I'm sure doctors in America would be forced to overwork if something like that happened here. Hopefully not until they literally die, though. What a waste of a life. Someone grows into an adult which already takes so much time and effort, then they go to med school and become a doctor which takes a ton more time and effort, and it's just thrown away for 10 days of treatment. Horrific."

AskReddit,fgnh2af,t1_fgmd4ia,1580944724.0,"Running, avoiding a fight, and deescalation should always be a top priority. Even if you win a fight you'll still probably be injured in some way, especially if you aren't experienced in fighting. Please don't say that's bad advice.

Your tips are good but what you really should have said is ""practice having to defend yourself every day so you are ready.""

There are some real good footing and technique advice here but most people won't know how to do much of any of that in the right range of motion, or with the right force, or with the right technique. All of these can cause injuries, which are ideally to be avoided. Unless you *know* how to fight and you ideally practice, your best bet is to just run.

If you *have* to fight, you gave good advice, but the best advice is still straight up avoid all fights. Easy win."

AskReddit,fgng1yf,t3_ezauxv,1580944104.0,"1. Run/flee if you can. The best way to ""win"" a fight is to not have to fight in the first place. This should always be #1. 

2. No rules; if you are defending yourself from an attacker, do not feel like you need to preserve the integrity of the attacker. Your mission is to keep yourself safe.

3. Good areas to focus: groin, eyes, throat. Again, you dont really want to have to hurt anyone but if you want to damage/distract them so up can get away, the eyes and groin will be the easiest and quickest way to ""disable"" them long enough to make an escape. This goes for men and women. Believe me, it hurts to get kicked in the genitals pretty bad as a woman, but isn't as debilitating as it is for men.

4. ANYTHING can be a weapon. Lots of sprays/aerosols are awful to get into your eyes. Sunscreen, hairspray, cologne, perfume. If it's on hand and someone is attacking you spray in their eyes. Glass cups, bottles, anything hard....gaming controllers, hard cover books, use whatever you have at your disposal to help you get to safety. Hit them in the head, the groin, eyes, face, neck...all good places to throw or slam something into. Hit them in the eyes with the bristle side of your hairbrush. Get creative. Your teeth, nails..they can be a good way to do damage of your need to. Being adaptable and quick thinking are good traits.

5. If you have a knife, and the person is stronger than you, you can assume it will soon be *their* knife. If you bring out a knife you better intend to use it *right away* and get away as soon as possible so you don't become a second knife victim.

6. I repeat, the best way to ""win"" a fight is to not fight in the first place. If you're are able to run *do it*."
Wellthatsucks,fgne9y8,t1_fgmksm9,1580943022.0,"Maybe he collected these as a reminder of that place in time. Some people feel that holding onto the bad, in a way, is how we remind ourselves not to do it again. Or maybe he thought they'd be worth a lot some day, and we're worth collecting/holding on to?

Either way, you are not your grandfather. You have lived a different life in a different world, so to speak. His actions do not reflect on you. You aren't suddenly going to become a Nazi or something because you found out your grandfather has WWII memorabilia.

You're allowed to see him as bad because of this, and you're also allowed to feel like it's not a huge deal...your feelings are your own and however you feel is allowed, even if you're feeling multiple things.

It's super weird to learn things like this about your family, especially those that have passed already. There is no ""how to grieve knowing your grandfather may have been a Nazi"" for dummies, so we are in uncharted territory. Try to remember that this was a very difficult place in history where many people were misled and threatened into submission under a facist regime. Also remember...you are your own person, and again, your grandfathers actions do not reflect on you. You have your own mirror. His is gone."

In total each horse can carry 3 medium size pelts, one large pelt or medium animal, (can't carry elk and bears and such) and two small animals on each side of the saddle. Rats and squirrels are tiny so they just go in your bag. 

If you can hunt the tiny ones correctly and not ruin the carcass they can be an easy way to make some $$$ since they don't get removed from your inventory if you die. All the stuff on your horse will be lost if you die. I pick them up whole instead of skinning as you can only carry one stack of meat but each tiny animal is its own slot so you don't run into that restriction."

There are so many different kinds of animals out there, though. Some animals have crazy long, intricate dances or routines to go through before they made. Maybe that's super sexy for them? Maybe it's just a bonding thing? Maybe they have to do it to ""wake up"" their reproductive system? There are so many different species out there that are complex in their own right.
