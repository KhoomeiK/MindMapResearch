tippytaps,fdic7ph,t1_fdhorwe,1578439626.0,"Honestly, cooking is so much easier when you don't have to deal with all the worries of meat! No cutting board contamination, minimum internal temperatures or risking getting sick. Animal products are the first things to go bad in the fridge, too. Many veggie alternatives just need to be reheated and you're good to go! 

I get most of my vegan recipes from Pinterest, but take a quick look at (and maybe show your parents):

/r/veganmemes :)

If you/your parents have a favourite recipe they like and make often, I'd love to try and help convert the recipe for you! Best of luck!"

ZeroWaste,fcf8l2e,t1_fcexvta,1577627560.0,"That does work, but it won't replace the need to stir as it's cooking. You gotta keep the noodles moving, especially in the first few minutes of cooking"
