college,feey8cl,t3_eorqdn,1579043833.0,"Human Development and Family Science. I was in a different major (medical lab science then anthropology) and had to take a human behavioral class. People told me the HDFS one was easy so I took it for the easy grade. The first class I went to I was immediately in love. I was learning about how humans form relationships, how those relationships differed and changed throughout a lifetime. It was all stuff that I had noticed throughout my life being an introvert and it was amazing to hear about it and the science behind it all. Every HDFS class after that I loved and my GPA went from a 2.7 to a 3.5 since I just enjoyed learning what my profs had to teach. I still use my major every single day at work (as an academic advisor) and in my personal life."
studentaffairs,fcv7k2c,t3_ej29fi,1577996284.0,"Wear good shoes! I cannot stress this enough. The interview I had for the job I am currently at had a tour as part of the on-campus. We took a golf cart, but I still logged over two miles of walking during that day-long interview. Expect to meet a variety of people either in one-on-one meetings or in group settings. People like faculty, students, department heads, and higher-up supervisors. If possible see if you can get on campus beforehand and walk around a bit to get your bearings since some campuses are large and can be a lot. It might help to go to places that might have some people, like grocery stores, a restaurant, or other places to talk to strangers. I had been unemployed and broke before my interview so my social skills and extrovert energy were not at their peak. I tried to get out more and talk to strangers to help with the variety of people I would be talking to all day at the interview. If they tell you the restaurants that they bring you to beforehand you might want to look at the menu ahead. It helps to know it beforehand since they will be asking you questions all through the meal, also order something that can easy to eat while talking (short pasta, pancakes, etc)"
college,fcizzpd,t1_fcixdnq,1577673885.0,Every university is different to get real answers you should contact the registrar's office and ask about specific courses. Also I would look at the courses you need to complete for your chosen major. A course may transfer but not work with the major you picked.
college,fcgvs5f,t3_eh7a4u,1577644420.0,"I don't have experience myself but I am an academic advisor who works with alot of transfer students. Some advise for out of state transfers is to save every syllabus from each of your courses. This will make it easier for faculty to see if your class could transfer in even if the registrar didn't do it automatically. Call the registar at the University to see if you get any benifits from completing an associates degree (at my university students don't need to complete common core). I would also see if you can take part in the freshman orientation events, community College and university are very different so it may be nice to get the resources and viewpoits of a freshman."
relationships,f9ofi3k,t3_e63hvf,1575503319.0,"I have the first-hand experience in the situation your girlfriend is in. I was in a really bad car accident and my boyfriend (now husband) had to legit do everything for me (cook, clean, walk me to the bathroom, get me into bed, walk with me to class in case I got stuck.)

What helped me feel better with him helping was him talking about how doing all of these things for me gave him a purpose and helped him feel like he could do something about the situation. He couldn't fix all my injuries, but he could make them less impactful. In the hospital when he couldn't do anything he would just beat himself up, but once he had legit power to help he felt better and so did I. Tell her how you feel about helping her and how it helps gives you a physical way to help the situation. Also, you can talk about how this is helping you bond more because pain is not pretty and it rare you get exposed to it before large life steps. 

I know for me after I got better, I was more aware of how to show love in non-romantic ways and has helped when my husband needs me to be there for him if he gets sick or hurt. It all about balance in the relationship and right now you are trying to help balance out her life."
