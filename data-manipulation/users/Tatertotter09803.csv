But she squirms, because of course even as a toddler she’s terrified of being 11 stories up. 

Grandfather holds onto her for a little bit “look! Look!”. Scared, the little girl squirms more, but the alcohol in grandpa’s system have fucked with his hand eye coordination and reaction times. He loses his grip and she falls. 

Panic. Terror. Horror. He falls to his knees, helpless. What he’s done is the most horrible, unthinkable thing he could have. It’s literally unfathomable. So the brain starts to rationalize. The thought that he is responsible is too much, so when questioned or when he talks about it, he starts throwing out every excuse that even remotely seems plausible. None of them are consistent (which is a huge clue this was not planned). 

“Well it can’t be my fault I thought the window was shut.”

“I was confused, I’m colorblind”

“I was trying to let her bang on the glass”

Eventually he convinces himself of each lie, even though logically they don’t make sense- he’s not thinking or acting logically- it’s all emotions at this point. It *cant* be his fault, that’s too terrible- there must be another reason. 

Of course the parents believe this too, because what’s the alternative, that their beloved father, who they trusted with their child’s life was reckless? That would mean they’re to blame too. The family needs to come together to support each other, after all. 

So who’s fault is it? There has to be a reason for the death for this innocent, very loved little girl. The parents are angry and hurt, and again, acting via pure emotion (ie, grief like most of us will never experience). 

Maybe it’s the cruises’ fault. Yeah, the faceless, heartless corporation that doesn’t care about people- they must be to blame here. The grandfathers story makes enough sense, time to lawyer up and make them pay. 


No one wins here. This story is tragic and the grandfather did something unspeakably reckless. PR police right on with the negligent homicide, but personally I don’t think the grandfather will ever be able to admit what he’s done. Who knows if the parents will? Poor little girl- it’s so tragic. I hope the family is able to someday heal from this."
