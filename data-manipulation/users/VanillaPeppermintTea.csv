fatlogic,ff8shon,t1_ff8f8pf,1579694362.0,That’s vaguely horrifying
UnresolvedMysteries,ff5tyz2,t1_ff5sahp,1579610155.0,He for sure deserves to die but I still think killing is just inherently wrong aside from self defence
fatlogic,ff5rvbe,t1_ff4zzl5,1579607842.0,Yeppppp I really messed up my hunger cues for years by doing this. I’ve cycled through periods of restriction and bingeing for like 8 years now and only in the last few months have I gotten to a point where it hasn’t been so much of an issue.
antinatalism,ff2rfxb,t3_er8ku4,1579520790.0,"I disliked children for years but now that I’m a substitute teacher (high school trained) I’ll still end up subbing at primary/elementary schools and oh god the little baby kindergartens are precious and make my heart melt. But holy fuck I do NOT want one of my own.
I do find, though, that I just generally have a lot more empathy and patience for misbehaving teenagers rather than misbehaving children when I’m teaching. I can still relate to being an angsty teen so when I see kids like that I really want to do all I can for them."
vegan,fezubz4,t1_fezdmtb,1579461757.0,She said thigh gaps and no periods are a good thing for everyone because it would be impractical evolution to have either of those things lol
unpopularopinion,fexzm0f,t1_fewbcxq,1579438819.0,Where are you that cigarettes are that cheap?! I don’t smoke but I think they’re $10-15 in Canada
gatekeeping,fexw8nt,t3_eqnvtk,1579437508.0,This makes sense because it’s a bit hypocritical to get upset by a dog being killed if you’ve got meat on your plate from animals that endured abuse.
canada,fewb0u2,t1_fesslhd,1579407775.0,I also just assumed it was Kenmount Terrace
canada,fewadt3,t1_fetp79g,1579407520.0,They very much care if they’re dying of dehydration.

namenerds,femkq33,t1_felr52e,1579260430.0,"Ahh I see! I think I like that Azariah wasn’t a misbehaving child at Target, then!"
namenerds,felox8l,t3_epppc3,1579227380.0,Seeing Azariah surprised me! I love that name so much for a boy but usually only see it on census records from the early 20th century or before when I’m looking for old and interesting names
fatlogic,fejhkwt,t3_ep4l2t,1579174587.0,"If you have a healthy relationship with food this is absolutely true, and after years of restrictive eating or binge eating I’m trying to get to this point.

If you actually LISTEN to your body, you can know what’s best for it. If you actually wait until you’re hungry, instead of just eating whenever you feel a slight urge, that’s good. Appetite and enjoyment are important too. Food legitimately tastes better when you’re actually hungry. 

I’m going to feel a LOT better eating a salad than I would eating 6 cookies. If I don’t eat enough vegetables in a day my body starts to feel unpleasant. 

Years of calorie counting sort of made me lose my ability to know my actual hunger cues so I’m trying to relearn that now. I’ve gotten to the point now where even if I eat something junky that I wouldn’t normally eat, I’m not able to eat too much of it because my body doesn’t like it"
AskReddit,fejgwvf,t1_feivjz8,1579173708.0,Spent 6 months driving one when I got my permit and never got the hang of it. Stalled it out constantly the entire time. Eventually my parents bought an automatic. I’m just generally incompetent.
UnsolvedMysteries,feglcdm,t1_feghhll,1579096326.0," A friend of a friend died that way maybe 8 years ago now. He was like 14? Really sad.
My dad’s had false front teeth since he was 16 because he drove into a wire when on skidoo one day."
UnresolvedMysteries,feairh0,t1_feaa8on,1578949336.0,That’s so disturbing. I’m glad you’re safe.
UnresolvedMysteries,feai1br,t1_fe96y8k,1578948981.0,That’s horrifying. Have you ever looked into any disappearances of children in that area around that time? It’s not unlikely that he’s try that more than once
AMA,fe9zs0r,t3_eo6vto,1578942920.0,"You mentioned it being discreet, so if you stuck your tongue out could it still look as if there’s no split?"
TwoXChromosomes,fdnq26j,t3_emc86r,1578590698.0,Don’t worry about it! Tbh I think cut dicks look weird.
AskReddit,fadmyua,t3_e8jzl7,1575979587.0,This invoked some sort of panic response I me because I thought about if the man I am in love with and want to spend the rest of my life with had a low number and now I’m sad :(
