I've been playing D&D for 30 years. 

* The spells are exactly the same, except to remove clever-abuse, they've been slowly removing parts of them edition after edition, making them mundane and predictable.
* Since spellcasters quickly outshine all melee classes, everyone is a caster eventually, and you hear the same spells repeated over and over again, by every player.
* Someone always wants to be the meat shield for you at level 1, and you kind of need it, but by level 7, the encounters are being tooled to give him a fair shake, while you're able to blastercast through whole armies. 
* The right spell selection, often serves to negate the need for a clever solution anyway. Instead of heightening the tension, it obliterates it. 
* And if you prepared some uncommon cornercase spell, and it never comes up, you've just hurt everyone in the party, by depriving yourself of another fireball, so you could hang onto ""Sending"".
* And you gotta have book in hand, so you know the exact details of your spells when it comes to you. What's the distance on a lightning bolt? How long does invisibility last if you dont attack anyone? Is there a somatic component to Charm Person?

A live multiplayer where you can trash talk each other, and see other development teams arriving for work? Sounds like it would be a reworking of the entire game, for not much payoff. Unless you then design a series of PVP actions into the game as well, for what is absolutely a rebuild of the entire game.

You could record data from a playthrough and import it as an AI rival, but the AI would have to take over a lot from there, as the markets shift in each game, a colossal success in one market, might be a tepid flop in another. Still with a little planning and a few corners rounded off, this could maybe work. 

Last option is to allow for the whole ""market"" to be simulated online. A group of players could subscribe to a piece of server software, that takes in all the active details of a software release, and updates the other players. In it's simplest form, this would require all players to play at the same game speed at the same time, 2 to 5 players with the same exact 6-8 hours to kill. With a little added complexity, you could have a central server that took in all player data, and inserted one players unique actions into the market of another player's game where appropriate, but it would require a lot of finnicky detail work to be passable. You'd mostly get a SPORE type issue, where player creations would occasionally appear in your world, but 50% of the time they'd be completely inept, and 75% of the time, they'd be manifestations of genitals and swearwords.

Worse the zero point is going to shift as time goes by. These lines are tracking a repayed loan by quarter, and as the payments come in, larger or smaller payments are going to shift these lines to predict other final payment dates.

I 100% think it's worth trying, but here's what will happen:

&#x200B;

You'll call and ask for an itemized bill. You'll speak to between 1 and 10 people, on 1 to 16 calls, spending 30 to 300 minutes, trying to get this to happen. You may be blocked at any time, by the fact that they simply do not itemize their bills any further than they have, or wont, or dont know how.  
If you do receive a bill, it will arrive after your first payment for the original bill is already late. You'll spend the same amount of time on the phone trying to fix that issue, and it also may never be fixed, and you may be stuck paying late fees or interest.  


When you get the itemized bill, 25% chance it's the exact same as what you already have. 10% chance the bill is lowered by an amount that doesn't really matter to you. 50% chance, the bill is what you actually wanted, but they still included items like a $37 bandaid, and you will spend double the previous amount of time and calls, trying to fight it, but discover eventually you cannot. You already signed saying you'd pay for care (under duress but they dont care), so you already agreed to pay whatever they charge for their products and services. If someone buys a bandaid from me, for $37 right now, they cannot return it, angry, that someone else sells them for less, at a later date. There is no return policy or price match policy at ER. There's just you trading your financial wellbeing for your physical wellbeing, and losing your mental wellbeing either way.   


I really hope someone somewhere is profiting using this strategy, and reducing their bills. What's being done in this country is criminal and a lot of people should hang."

Whenever a new tv exec hits the scene, he always shuffles all the shows the previous guy got running. If he doesn't, he'll look incompetent because the shows he's putting on the schedule right now, are unable to compete."
todayilearned,fcbbama,t3_egwlvw,1577584765.0,"Yeah, without reading the article, it was clear when the show was airing the network hated it. It was Groening's vanity project and the animation budget was enormous. Even if it Could/Should have been profitable at that level, some exec who predicted it's downfall absolutely had to assure he was right to keep their job.

A big issue in television that happens a lot, is that new execs will make their own shows look more favorable than the last guys, by moving the older shows all over the network.

So our blades team has been oh so happy to resort to violence in every instance, and as a result they've all been pretty roughed up. If I had remembered to use the penalties for injury ever, they would have been shit out of luck, on every score from here to Tycheros."
