madisonwi,ff6rb0m,t1_ff5y70r,1579633242.0,I went there too and got the fuck. I really feel like the culture at the highschool was toxic back in the 90s. I hope it has changed.
AmItheAsshole,ff33smm,t3_er769r,1579532953.0,NTA. People jumping into line because of reason X at at a theme park pisses me off. You don't need to ride it. You want to ride it.

Stock_Picks,fdw8iwn,t3_en8l8n,1578756175.0,"Ameritrade has margins, I don't recall if there's a a cost. I was using mine before the trade fees went a away. They will give you more than 2500. Essentially they woul give you whatever your own portfolio is worth"
Stock_Picks,fdsundd,t3_emzkyk,1578708159.0,"I use TD Ameritrade and Robinhood. I have used Ameritrade for over 10 years. They recently got rid of fees for trading. They offer a a lot more info and there are a lot more things you can invest in. Robinhood is decent. Their app is very simple - I'm not really in love with it. It's clean, and less intimidating than the Ameritrade app."

bipolar,fdatzcu,t1_fdatiur,1578250130.0,"I have been trying to pay close attention to when I become aware of my shift in mood and if possible, try to do something proactive to move the needle to a new track so to speak. I hate not being able to trust my feelings."
bipolar,fd63ghu,t3_ek1gi9,1578185015.0,"I think what OP is talking about is known as LTD. Short and Long term disability insurance is something employers offer up to employees as a means to replace income in the event the have something that makes them unable to work. It's not social security and as such, it can involve health questions and underwriting. Assuming OP had to apply for it, I'm guessing it's not fully covered by the employer. Is it a good thing to have? Sure, if the insurer actually helps you out when you need it."
bipolar,fd61h26,t3_ek348g,1578184223.0,"I had a trip to the pharmacy that made me burst into tears. The price for meds is a bitter pill to swallow. No pun intended. It costs a lot to keep me from living in existential dread, rage, loneliness etc.... And even with meds, it's not always that easy. I have no advice, but hang in there."
wisconsin,fcjwv0z,t1_fcix5wq,1577708549.0,"Dane county here. A little over 10 years ago we had a winter with 100 inches of snow fall. I was running out of places to stack it. We have had plenty of rain, and I would rather see some snow and not need an umbrella. In terms of your back - I suppose the grass is greener, and the grass is greener here, which is weird."
wisconsin,fcazbe3,t3_egwbu4,1577579583.0,"I got a snowblower this year. Granted, it was free and a fixer upper, but I only used it once over a month ago. Don't even get me started on the skis in my garage. To all of those people who are ok with winter not being winter in Wisconsin...  Some of us like winter. The climate is broken."
civ,fc9z440,t3_egt4tw,1577560369.0,I bought a switch lite and civ 6 for myself despite owning it for PC. I really like the handheld experience.
wisconsin,fc9yu4h,t1_fc9std8,1577560255.0,Some of us lack connections. I really liked the dispensary experience in CA and CO.

I was playing Witcher 3 last weekend and I called Roach and he came up out of the lake, calmly as if  he just waited underwater."
