depression,fenjjo6,t1_fenj2po,1579286057.0,"See, this is my past experience as well. I would be able to turn it off for a date or two, but then I'd get exhausted from keeping the act up, and self-sabotage the whole thing. It was like a slingshot effect where the act of trying made me feel worse because it didn't fix everything right away (silly I know).

And then the few times I've tried to be upfront and honest about how I am, I walk away feeling like the other person either didn't get it (think I'm just sad or something) or they were completely turned off by it.

But yeah, for those brief moments, I feel normal and worthy, and chasing that feeling is all I've got to go on for now."
depression,fenj9ky,t1_femgv6j,1579285884.0,"You're absolutely right it's gonna be awkward, haha. No avoiding that. I just need someone perched on my shoulder at all times telling me that, and that most people are awkward, and that nobody ever got less alone by making the attempt."
depression,fenj518,t1_femhzf8,1579285806.0,"With depression, the longer it goes on, the harder it is to tell what ""caused"" it to begin with. So for me I know there's family genetics involved (my great-uncle killed himself, my cousin tried, and I'm sure many more of my family is depressed but We're Catholic So We Don't Talk About It).

...but, yeah, after a while, it becomes self-perpetuating with the anxiety and toxic thought patterns. Negative thinking is definitely comfortable for me, my brain feels like it literally revolts if I try to pay myself a compliment."
depression,fenitw3,t1_fen5e88,1579285619.0,"I'm not depressed because I don't have a lover/partner, I'm depressed because I've *never had one*, I'm 30 years old, and I feel fundamentally unlovable. Going through life every day feeling entirely disconnected from everyone around you is hell."
depression,femfzjb,t1_fel524h,1579253524.0,"This.

The difference between normal and disordered -- does it negatively impact your day to day life?

MDD definitely does. I'll spend hours in my head just fantasizing, and it's always crushing having to return to ""real life""...it's a temporary escape from depression but in the long term it's just another form of avoidance, and it makes the problem worse."
