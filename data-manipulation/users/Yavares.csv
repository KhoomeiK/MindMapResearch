The beat reporters are dealing with the team, players, coaches, and front office everyday. Their relationship with the decision makers is probably better than a guy who left during the old administration. Pat covers a wide variety of information around the sporting world. The beat reporters only really deal with the Colts and other local teams. I may be wrong though."

Colts,ffrcc59,t1_ffqjrok,1580155116.0,"I think no one picks Mack. Henry is most likely being picked as the Titans player for Texans and maybe Jags.  Nelson, Kelly, Leonard, and maybe TY or Moore are my guesses for other teams, but I think Nelson should be picked by all of them. Titans probably wouldn’t because their O-Line is nice. Leonard should be the Titans in that case. Doyle could be a dark horse for the Titans due to their TE depth right now. I really wish TY and Moore had full seasons. 

My picks for other teams picking Colts players:
Titans: Leonard
Jags: Nelson
Texans: Nelson

My picks for Colts:
Titans: Henry or AJ Brown 
Texans: Watson or Watt (Hopkins would be really nice though)
Jags: Josh Allen or Calais Campbell"
Colts,ffmt0aq,t1_ffmpjcm,1580058605.0,"Sorry for all of the questions, but do you remember who else was available? I have heard there is a big question of blocking for Kmet, but he is an amazing receiving threat. I know there are some big Notre Dame fans in this subreddit, but I was wondering if there is a good unbiased breakdown of Kmet. I am hesitant to fall in love with a poor blocking TE with our current run heavy offense. I know someone like Kmet could ramp up our pass offense, but I kind of think we should bolster DL or OT before getting a purely pass down TE. 

These are all my own hopes, but I would love to hear your response."

Colts,fdfqlxe,t1_fdfihjv,1578367835.0,"Russell was part of a Saban coached team for one year, but I agree that he did not become an instrumental part of the team until Les Miles became coach. The original commenter lists him in his list, but I do agree that the systems are vastly different. 

I also agree with you on the offensive coordinator comment. I think developing a quarterback is more reliant on the OC and QB coaches than a former DB Head Coach. Saban has had a lot of OC turnover in his tenure, as his success has led to many of his assistants getting head coaching positions. Furthermore, the styles of the OCs have varied greatly. 

My answer was in response to the basis the original commenter gave."

AJ and Greg were not highly coveted. AJ had some looks, but he was largely viewed as a game manager with great pieces around him. AJ also had a little controversy when he got drafted by telling teams he wouldn’t make it to their pick unless they traded up. He didn’t go until the 5th round, which was hilarious. Greg is a great guy, but he was never viewed to be as talented as Tua. Both Greg and AJ have had good success as backups, but neither have the skill and talent Tua has."

NFL_Draft,fdcui8h,t1_fdc5cql,1578284682.0,"I agree Okereke and Willis were easily the best rookies. I think Banogu and Tell were next best. Both played great when they were in the game, but they were not as impactful as the first two players I mentioned. 

Rock is a guy that shows promise, but he definitely showed that he was a rookie at times. He was definitely top 3 rookies in impact to the team. He just did not play as well as the above players in my opinion. Moore going down probably didn’t help his situation, because Rock was thrown into the fire pretty early and CB injuries during the season just made it worse. I could definitely see him being a great CB for the team, but right now, I feel like he is still getting adjusted. 

Campbell is someone I wish got to play more. He had small flashes in games, but I do not know if he will overtake the WR2 role. He struggled with injuries all season. The WR depth was nonexistent this year as Funchess, TY, and Campbell all  went down. Campbell will definitely see touches when he gets healthy, and Ballard seems to be high on him.

The rest: I didn’t see enough from anyone else for me to form an opinion. I think Speed could be good, but I am not even sure he will be on the roster next year."
