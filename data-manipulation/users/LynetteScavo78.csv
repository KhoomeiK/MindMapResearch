AmItheAsshole,ffhwmr8,t3_etqasp,1579957193.0,NTA You build your career - nobody's going to thank you for staying and chances are every single colleague of yours would take the chance if it was offered to them.
relationships,ffcmix9,t3_eswnf7,1579802615.0,As a mother of a daughter (soon to be 16) who has just started to be sexually active I think you need to take a step back. You say you trust your daughter - then show it and let her make her own decisions.
relationship_advice,ffclujr,t3_eswnwa,1579802205.0,My guess would be that he wants to guilt trip you to cover his own unfaithfulness and uses the FWB thing to keep you under his control and as a backup for when he gets dumped by his mistress.

funny,ffaz4at,t3_esmu7i,1579747844.0,I once brought a similar assignment home when I was a kid and my dad saw it. He told me not to do it and left a note telling the teacher that our family life and lifestyle was none of her business.
aww,ffayjhw,t1_ffa6izu,1579747460.0,Thanks for letting me know! I appreciate it!
relationship_advice,ff9js6w,t3_eseztg,1579714501.0,"Cook for yourself and friends who appreciate your efforts. If he wants some, fine, if he doesn't he's a big boy and can prepare his own happy meal."

TwoXChromosomes,ff8gu64,t3_es8b3u,1579677872.0,"Good for you! I guess everybody's different and your doctor, if she's any good, is basing her recommendations on her experience and her knowledge of studies and meta analyses. Personally, I'm on my fourth Mirena and I don't even get a period anymore. I just love it."

relationship_advice,fexug4h,t3_eqvfzt,1579436400.0,"While your boyfriend's penis size being underwhelming I don't think that's the biggest problem here. I'm more concerned with his apparent lack of interest in pleasing you, in enjoying sex as a mutual pleasure. If you manage to talk to him, which I would highly encourage, I think you should focus on this aspect of your sex life. There are so many other way to experience pleasure than penetration but he's gotta be willing to explore. If he doesn't change his attitude towards sex I don't think you're going to be happy on the long run."
dogs,ferj2a2,t3_eqgc84,1579354530.0,"Make sure good things (attention, treats, cuddles) happen to her while the other dog is around. She'll associate the newbie with positive feelings and will like him."
AmItheAsshole,fem8nkq,t3_epwsip,1579243790.0,YTA - either this is a shitpost and then YTA for that or you're a crappy father with no manners who feels entitled to be supported by his daughter.

AmItheAsshole,fem3xme,t3_epw0f4,1579238931.0,"YTA This is incredibly controlling behavior and you're betraying the trust of your wife. You can voice your concern and your preferences about her weight but ultimately it's her body, her decision."

insanepeoplefacebook,fedi2q5,t3_eolsa2,1579012078.0,"There's no point in teaching your own choldren that it's their body their rules, that they're entitled to their own limits when you then go on and just ignore them. Keep in mind that a lot of sexual abuse happens within the family."

Dogtraining,fe8sxg0,t1_fe7vyqe,1578930388.0,Willingly keeping/getting a pet even though one doesn't have nearly enough time for it has nothing to do with love. That's just egoism.
AmItheAsshole,fe7n9do,t1_fe7mr4a,1578916911.0,Good to hear. Good luck with your pup. I hope she recovers from this experience and that you will find somebody more reliable to watch her next time.

>He is a nice guy, but does a lot of stupid shit, usually with good intentions.

However, you're still to blame for leaving your pup with and relying on someone who you know isn't 100% trustworthy."
dogs,fe6ua9z,t1_fe6t3yj,1578905281.0,That's normal but you can teach her to settle. After training and excercise she'll be tired. Sit down with her and when she lies with you introduce a command for settling. It will take a while but she'll learn if you keep doing that.
dogs,fe6srgc,t3_eo0x50,1578903670.0,"Best possible life? Get her into herding. If this isn't an option, try agility, (rally) obedience, hoopers, flyball... Anything to keep her mind stimulated. Also consider that these high energy, high drive dogs sometimes need to be taught and told to calm down. Instead of keeping her in the yard all day take her inside after exercising/training and teach her to go lie down. Downtime is just as important as excercise and mental stimulation (but that's no free pass to cancel on those)."
