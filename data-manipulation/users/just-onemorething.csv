fiddleleaffig,ffjv0mk,t1_ffhwnw4,1580007712.0,"Two cuttings; I cut about 4-6 leaves down, the leaves were very densely packed, and I actually cut both sides at spots where there were a bunch of bare nodes for whatever reason. About 10 to 12 inches down from the growing tips, which are both very active. I trimmed off the bottom 2 or 3 leaves from each of the two cuttings so there would be some bare stem, let it callous for a few hours, then rubbed rooting hormone on the ends and put them in water in the middle of a bunch of other healthy plants. I have a pic I took from above I can post if that helps a bit. I am avoiding even looking at the cuttings right now, letting them rest"
