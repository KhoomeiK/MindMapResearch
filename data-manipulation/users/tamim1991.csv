selfimprovement,ffacu72,t3_erziql,1579732536.0,That's right dude. Wallowing in the past doesn't do much good even if we have wasted away hours of unproductivity. We can learn from the experiences though in what environments that may have caused us harm and how we ended up wasting time (did we just stay at home all day when perhaps we could've gone to the library or go gym to get the energy moving. And that learning about ourselves itself is progress. Next thing you know you have given yourself 2 minutes to start something and those 2 minutes turn into 2 hours. Sometimes the bad days are there to remind us of the good ones. It gives us enough pain to remind us why we need to strive for more.

Accepting myself, a lot of anxiety went away, when I became my skewed mindset of life (needing to please everyone) and I changed it doing the best I can for myself. I realised I was doing little things subconsciously, wearing nice clothes, trying to look taller, going to the gym for the wrong reasons etc. All for OTHER people and that all contributed to the general anxiety and tension I had around people. I feel much better now letting go of all of that. It is a journey and it's great that you are taking it upon yourself."

selfimprovement,fds7bkl,t1_fdr0t9h,1578695984.0,"I feel that a lot dude. That's exactly what happened when I started a martial art (BJJ). A great deal of motivation before my first session and then it just went away only to be replaced by anxiety and looking for excuses just to skip classes. I realised the root of my anxiety before the class was to do with time, time away from my wife and how she will be, if she will get bored alone at home etc. Dissociating from my thoughts and just going to the class no matter is what kept me consistent - just being disciplined."

By doing something in that moment....but something different, in a different environment must help a lot. I noticed with a lot of bad habits I was trying to cut out my most effective way of dealing with them is changing the environment, even if it's just sitting in a different room."
