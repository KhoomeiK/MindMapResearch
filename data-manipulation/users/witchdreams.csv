AmItheAsshole,ff797zq,t3_es1lw1,1579643679.0,"NEI. While you're not an asshole for wanting a kid that's biologically yours, think about the danger that carrying to term would put on her, and the fact that a kid that's hers also will possibly have the same condition. Not to mention the stress that child raising could have on her condition. And of course, if it eventually does kill her, would you be ready to raise your kid alone and the potential medical expences that come with having a child with a medical condition?

Have you discussed children before? Talked about having them or adoption or any other sorts of ways to have kids?

How long have you been together? If you've been together for years, then surely you've discussed children at some  point or you've thought about kids of your own before recently? I'm sure she didn't just drop this fact on you suddenly that having kids would be detrimental to her health and safety. 

All in all, this seems to be something you really should discuss as a couple because children is a deal breaker in many relationships. If you want a kid bad enough, then maybe your relationships run its course."

Also when you apply, write down the date somewhere. Because applying before the 3 month mark just makes you look bad since they do keep track from what I read and you don't want to do that because that shows you don't follow rules. 

Keep your synopsis at 500 word mark. A few less or extra isn't gonna hurt you but if you've got like 50 extra or less you're gonna have to cut it/add to it.

I empathize with your sister because I'm sure it hurts, but she should be happy that her daughter is cared for and comfortable enough with you that she'd think of you as her mom.

Edit; just saw you said you adopted her. If you actually legally adopted her, you are legally her mother. Full stop. She is your child. Have zero guilt because you took that on when you didn't have too, you have taken care of her emotionally, legally, and financially. Her birth mother no longer has any rights to her and she should count her blessings that she doesn't have to worry every day where her child is, if she remembers her, if she's safe and happy and loved, etc. That's being an ungrateful bitch on her part."

There's a difference between Hopper disappearing into a rift and no one acknowledges it, and Joe actively knowing he's killed her, the police dug up body, Nicky in prison, and Becks posthumous book. We saw that."

Wattpad,fcq0mjp,t3_ei7cla,1577876191.0,"I see where your coming from but I usually just ignore it, as my issue is the 20 chapters with useless shit before you get to chapter one (fc is usually included in that though). I really don't care about quotes, Playlist etc unless I'm wholy invested, which not gonna happen before I actually read any of it. 

That being said, I do the face claim/graphics/trailer stuff for fun but I post it at the very end of book in a single chapter so it can be entirely avoided, and I still try and describe my characters in text.

Tbh I prefer fc chapter that I can avoid over 3 effin paragraphs of character description of themselves in chapter one while looking in a mirror and a full page of everyone's looks and a magazine ad telling us their entire damn outfit (unless outfit is shocking or its like some big formal wear, I really don't give a rats ass what they wear)."

It might almost be 2020 but there's always older generations who will make sure things we find old won't be obsolete. I'm 28 and I don't even know what the hell apple pay does, and in my small town of 40k, I don't even think I've even seen a store who advertised having it."
