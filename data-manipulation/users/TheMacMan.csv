SEO,ffsg3kn,t3_euzi2q,1580180857.0,"Google is really good at identifying irrelevant links and just ignoring them. Unless you're seeing a negative impact, there's no reason to bother with disavowing at this point. It's just a waste of time, as Google already likely ignores them."
Minneapolis,ffsf7ue,t1_ffsdwel,1580180243.0,You could buy those miles for far less and not waste hours and hours of your time. I've got far better things to do with my life than sit on a plane trying to rack up points.
pics,ffsakz4,t3_eutbm7,1580177154.0,"In elementary school, we were coming back from outside during gym class. It was that time when everyone was into jumping up and seeing if they could touch the top of the doorway and a friend did so. The metal door closed on his fingers and took 3 of them off. Watched out teacher scoop the fingers up and off to the nurse they went. Doctors were able to reattach one, partially reattach another, and the third they weren't able to do so. Through the rest of our school years, his nickname was Stubby."
videos,ffs9msa,t3_euqa1d,1580176513.0,It's amazing the amount of time Reddit enjoys investing in YouTube drama.
funny,ffs9c4n,t1_ffrs7cj,1580176311.0,Yup. Our county libraries have book sales to clear inventory every few months and sell them for $5 for everything you can fit in a brown paper bag.

It's against the Facebook Terms of Service to have more than 1 Facebook account."
Minneapolis,ffs2z62,t3_euu1yw,1580171857.0,I keep getting emails about great deals on flights from Minneapolis to China for only $530 (a relatively good deal). There's a reason they're so discounted right now. Only a matter of time before we see it hit MN.
digital_marketing,ffrvtlp,t3_eusdqo,1580166995.0,"Google's own Google Ads Certification is the best resource out there and it's free. Get certified, it'll help you with not only Google Ads but also Bing Ads, Facebook ads, Twitter ads, and any other type of CPC/CPM advertising.

Don't pay a penny for ad training."
SEO,ffrv2me,t3_eus9cs,1580166493.0,It doesn't improve rank. But it can get you more visibility.
apple,ffrq8xs,t1_ffrj9z7,1580163411.0,">Elon also mentioned he had to let go of his decade long assistant (which the biography reported on) because his workload had increased so much, he needed a team of assistants to work with him.

So somehow his assistant is able do the work of an entire team? Should just have them work on engineerings and fire entire departments instead.

Clearly you have a hardon for him. Nothing that anyone could say, no matter how true, would change that. It's not even worth continuing to discuss, as it'd be like trying to get a Trump-fan to change their views.

Have a nice afternoon."
