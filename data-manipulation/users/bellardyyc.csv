I would love to watch that last push to the finish line live."
todayilearned,ffhhcve,t1_ffh6u1b,1579935285.0,It is?
MapPorn,ffhh56l,t3_eteysq,1579935020.0,Wunderschön
MapPorn,ffhc9n2,t3_etltb8,1579929625.0,Mesmerizing
Showerthoughts,ffdmysu,t1_ffdlmh0,1579824319.0,"Yes. 
I’ve heard of silliness like this. I typically pretty anal about units, so it’s pretty much habit to include the “."
Vulfpeck,ffdkpvo,t1_ffd2crk,1579822934.0,"Back, neck, and arms. 
The goosebump trifecta. 


All do WFTM was outstanding, but I agree this stole the show."
Showerthoughts,ffd3nmd,t1_ffcvav3,1579812786.0,I would want to see this before approving it. But it would likely meet my standards.
Showerthoughts,ffd19th,t1_ffct3hb,1579811437.0,"Laptops are welcome. Notes are encouraged (typed or otherwise). And I will make exceptions on occasion to allow approved typed sheets. 

I like to be fair and supportive. 
I also want to make sure I’m challenging my students to a fair degree."
Showerthoughts,ffd1056,t1_ffcj5eb,1579811287.0,"I have made exceptions for situations like this. 
I would allow students to type up a sheet, that I would subsequently approve before an exam. I don’t like making this the rule, because it gets exploited too easily."
Showerthoughts,ffcv9qz,t1_ffcumuz,1579807981.0,"Yes. This is why we do it. 
This is also why we put space limits on them."
Showerthoughts,ffcv7bk,t1_ffchxiw,1579807939.0,Haha. No doubt.
Showerthoughts,ffcv65v,t1_ffchke8,1579807920.0,Wow. That’s some next level shit right there.
Showerthoughts,ffcv446,t1_ffcgli3,1579807884.0,Well done.
Showerthoughts,ffcey1u,t1_ffccu7q,1579798004.0,"I’m cool with a magnifying glass. 
Remember, it has to be hand written, and not copied (can’t be photocopied or printed smaller). 

I generally try to set up my exams to require some time management. If you’re looking up everything with a magnifying glass, you likely won’t finish the whole exam."
Showerthoughts,ffcerf2,t1_ffcelek,1579797894.0,"Genius!!
Haven’t seen this one used yet. 
I wouldn’t prohibit it. 
I would call it creative interpretation of the rules."
