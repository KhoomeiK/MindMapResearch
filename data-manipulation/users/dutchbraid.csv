lasik,ffe20fh,t3_e5pmqz,1579834632.0,I just had an appointment and have been cleared for PRK. My cornea is too thin for Lasik and I feel a bit scared about it. How long did it take for your vision to be comfortable for things like driving or night time activities?

lasik,fetjcr7,t1_fetg7fe,1579376052.0,Thanks!!!
lasik,fesvogk,t1_fesveop,1579369493.0,Congratulations!! Did they dilate you're eyes during the consultation?
lasik,feslscd,t1_feslm5d,1579366572.0,"Yeah Indo too especially because I have the hole in my retina that was corrected. Best of luck with your situation, I'm sure it'll be just fine!"
lasik,fesiz7w,t1_fesiq5v,1579365713.0,Oh damn. I had heard they dilate your eyes during the consultation but I don't know why she said no drops at all. Now I'm scared.
lasik,ferej9z,t1_fepfewy,1579352981.0,Lol!! Im going to keep repeating this.
lasik,fer7pod,t3_cze3vp,1579350868.0,You did it! Could you give details of how the clinic was and how it went please?
lasik,fer6d0e,t3_cx9ndr,1579350436.0,"I'm feeling the exact same way. I have a consultation with Bochner this week and it'll likely be done by dr. Stein as well. Ive been looking up videos too on YouTube among the many positives, those news clips with the horror stories have freaked me out a little. But having said that three of my friends have had Lasik done (two by Bochner, the most recent had it in April by dr. Stein and she'd highly recommend), I met two people last year who had it done and they said it was amazing and one girls boyfriend had PRK done and he loved his results too. Additional my coworker had it don't by Herzig and recommends it too. My boyfriend said he met someone who had an complication but no details and about the surgery were given. I really do think the who and where are important. Good luck with whatever decision you make (or made)!"
lasik,fer154v,t3_ebscaq,1579348454.0,"Congrats! I have a consultation with Bochner on Thursday and ive managed to freak myself out a little with all these anti-lasik videos and post (some of which don't say where they got their Lasik from). What was your experience and who performed your surgery? Also how much did it cost?

Edited to ask: Did they do a full exam at the consultation? The receptionist told me there would be no drops during the appointment so I was okay to drive. I thought they'd do a full check?"
lasik,fepf86e,t3_ep5mps,1579319013.0,"Did they dilate your eyes during the consultation to check for holes to begin with? I had a hole that they lasered, its super quick and easy."
lasik,fepemgd,t1_fepbqbu,1579318596.0,I hope you'll share you experience too! I have consultation this week.

lasik,fdnjhqo,t1_fdnhb2b,1578587108.0,"Hi, so sorry to hear your didn't go well. What are the details of your scenario pre-Lasik and what are your issues now? What did you doc say about your condition?"
rarepuppers,fdm6spm,t3_em0qx1,1578541201.0,My God! She's adorable. Give her kisses and hugs for whatever she wants.

lasik,fdl8b44,t1_fdl316d,1578518748.0,Oh man! That's a good strategy but I'd be too scared to go back again.
lasik,fdl86mk,t1_fdl06y5,1578518686.0,Hopefully it'll go away soon. Thanks!
lasik,fdl831s,t3_eli38e,1578518637.0,Thank you!
lasik,fdkp9wu,t1_fdkor49,1578508313.0,Wow!! What was your prescription before if you don't mind me asking? Yours is the most ideal scenario I feel.
lasik,fdk1wmn,t1_fdilv1q,1578494018.0,I've been gunning for Lasik but I don't know which they'll do yet (if at all). I've been looking up a lot of Lasik but I should learn more about people's experience with PRK. What was the pain like post surgery? Would a week off work be enough?
lasik,fdk1qe8,t1_fdijudm,1578493893.0,what kind of procedure did you get? How long did the halos stay? If you knew about the halos before the surgery would that have changed your decision to get it?
lasik,fdjq8pr,t1_fdj2dpv,1578483235.0,Thanks! Did they tell you the surgery type you'd be getting at the consultation? I saw some videos where people didn't know before hand.
lasik,fdijmq3,t1_fdii61j,1578444387.0,Amazing!! And thank you for the info!
lasik,fdhzn1z,t1_fdhzk2l,1578433080.0,Thanks for your response!
lasik,fdhzixi,t3_egd4jw,1578433022.0,Thanks for the write up! Have you been out driving at night? I know everyone heals differently but how long after the surgery were you able to drive at night? How long after were you comfortable enough to play soccer or exercise? I know they say officially two weeks but what was your experience?
lasik,fdhxrz6,t1_fcj9vi3,1578432091.0,"What did they give you post surgery? Do they give you something before the surgery to calm you down?

I'm going in for a consultation at the end of the month with them, how was your experience?"

netflix,fckruyl,t1_fcjd1qo,1577731838.0,Yes yes yes!! The Candace story line was just nonsense. She might as well have been a new character she practically did nothing with her knowledge.

netflix,fcchy0y,t1_fcapt6i,1577598593.0,Nothing made any sense to me. Okay Joe I can go with it but the other characters motivation just didn't work. It's such an unpopular opinion to absolutely hate this season and I don't get it.
