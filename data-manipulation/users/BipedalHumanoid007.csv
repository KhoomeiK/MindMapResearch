FloralDesign,ffl04ym,t3_etygzb,1580032339.0,My only constructive criticism is that it looks just a bit too symmetrical like another redditor said. I'd arrange it to be a little less balanced. That's just me though. Everybody is different. Pretty arrangement though.

Guy is classless through and through."
Inkmaster,ffhjzgp,t1_ffhfkpm,1579938755.0,Definitely odd. I agree with that. But it didnt look out of place or ruin the tattoo for me. I'd argue that the cloaked womans right hand looks worse.
AskMen,ffgibxj,t1_fffv3p6,1579906890.0,This again and again. Best show I've ever watched.
spikeball,fferw9b,t1_ffeiv7i,1579862537.0,Whoa I gave it a look and it creeped me out. Very weird.
Inkmaster,ffdetxk,t1_ff8bdmp,1579819384.0,Holy shit you're absolutely right. Thanks for the links.
Inkmaster,ffde5z9,t1_ff8pixx,1579818987.0,I thought the penguin was the best tattoo of that whole episode. To each their own.
Inkmaster,ffde1he,t1_ff8eodm,1579818913.0,I loved it but I wouldn't want to wear it myself.
Inkmaster,ffddhfr,t3_er70nq,1579818580.0,Awesome!! I love her style.
Inkmaster,ffddfof,t3_esnl6d,1579818551.0,Yes it was.

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ff8iq9w,t3_es2l66,1579680331.0,What kind of dog is this? A terrier or a doodle of sorts?
Inkmaster,ff7s8i1,t3_erxdu4,1579657099.0,We dont want to watch people assemble a tattoo machine though. We want to watch art.
conspiracy,ff385ti,t1_ff2h78y,1579535965.0,Sounds like a good book.

Inkmaster,fezn80c,t1_fez0vuv,1579459254.0,No I agree with that for sure. Rules are rules and they all signed off on that.
Inkmaster,feuo2jc,t3_eqho1r,1579388391.0,"Nah I dont think we like it. Fortunately for us, it is really only a small portion of the whole episode."
Noses,feum4rd,t3_eqe6xr,1579387857.0,Everybody has an ugly smile? We're trying to lift people up not bring everyone down.
holdmycosmo,feq81c6,t3_eqbbe9,1579338664.0,This is the best one so far.

piercing,fepwvg4,t3_eq84j7,1579333786.0,Yes gold looks nice on you for sure. Glad you're wearing it proudly. Love the 3 earrings.
millionairemakers,feoudtv,t3_eq81a8,1579305648.0,Woohoo!!!
funny,fenuguo,t1_fenaww6,1579290952.0,I absolutely love it (I'm from Canada)
aww,femxmax,t1_femrd48,1579272252.0,Fair enough. Are my downvotes really necessary?
toptalent,femxjoj,t1_femsq1h,1579272202.0,"Good to know, thanks."

Casefile,femr9ik,t1_femc0my,1579267313.0,Nothing is off limits.
Inkmaster,femqoay,t3_epyyiv,1579266794.0,"I liked Josh from season 5. Sure he was a prick but you know what? He's a good tattoo artist and he knows it. He's cocky and that's okay. He's allowed to be. He was gonna be a runner up in his season but got kicked off prematurely for breaking contract rules and smoking pot. This was after he did the best tattoo of that day, too. That really sucked. He fucked up."
aww,femprbx,t1_fempl9i,1579265962.0,"Hmm, some animals probably but all of my googles relating to hamsters affirmed it."
aww,femppal,t1_fempmr6,1579265910.0,I just googled do hamster's killing their babies and every search I found was affirmative to that.
aww,fempjn4,t1_fempedk,1579265761.0,I have know some friends who have had pets that have done that. Like a hamster.
aww,fempai7,t3_epyj0v,1579265518.0,Is it safe to pet? Like will momma smell human and be upset at fawn or anything?
