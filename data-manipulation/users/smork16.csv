But you need multivitamins asap to feed your brain first. Your self care is No.1 priority before everything and everyone else because you can't do anything without that first."
ADHD,ffpwagu,t3_eujeyh,1580108214.0,"Wait, what? You've got a 1 year old AND a two year old. There's no way that an NT mother will have all the housework done too. Is your SO understanding that toddlers are hard? That even NT mothers would find it hard too? You need empathy and respect. 

Please don't do the CBT as it's ableist on executive functioning Disability because a lot of the tasks are based on NT executive functioning. I did some and noticed it's deficiencies for us NDs. How can you do executive functioning exercises when you haven't got executive function?  It's like telling a paraplegic that the lift is broken but they've still got to get up 14 floors by themselves.  Ridiculous. 

What I've learned is most helpful is Prof. Julia Rucklidges study on micronutrients ( multivitamins) and emotional regulation. I've noticed side effects like a greater ability to focus and think clearer. I think it's because our brains work harder in areas but don't do as well in others so multivitamins support this. I'll try to find the paper.

Edit. Here's the link. Professor Rucklidge is a touch ableist as most NT professionals that I've met usually are but she's on the right track. My youngest son went up 9 reading levels while he was in the trial.
