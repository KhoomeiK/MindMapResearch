depression,ffdw3ka,t1_ffdt8dn,1579830376.0,">You put an awful lot of emphasis on dating and relationships but not so much yourself. Have you tried thinking about the positive aspects you bring to a relationship?

All of my good qualities are qualities any basic feeling human has. The insecurity and low confidence make the good qualities not matter, because you could just as easily find a guy who has those same qualities without the flaws. It's pretty objective when you look at it like that.

>See, I have an inkling that you don't enjoy yourself, as in you, the individual. 

I don't. That's another reason why I'm not attractive.

>By saying the opposite your, in a subconcious sense, self sabotaging yourself. What's important here is knowing your worth, accepting that you do deserve affection, but only with those compatible.

But if I like a girl, she doesn't have to like me back. Feeling upset and frustrated over women choosing who they want and don't want to be with makes you entitled. But aside from that, I try to just do things that involve me and not worry about it. 

>So no, loneliness is not better, however you mustn't fixate. When the time is right it'll happen. For now be concious of your thoughts and be confident that it'll inevidently happen, it's only a matter of when.

I'm trying not to fixate, the problem is it's always in the back of my mind. It's annoying. And I have absolutely no reason to believe it will happen. So I'm trying to learn to be happy without it"
depression,ffdu9hc,t1_ffdt68t,1579829076.0,"Idk, I mean, I have jealousy and insecurity issues. Women I've pursued and even dated have told me, first hand, they don't like those qualities in a guy. They're deal breakers. Once one girl even warned another girl I liked to avoid me because I'm insecure and will make her unhappy. And by typing all of this, I'm just looking more and more self-pitying, which makes me even less attractive. But I have to hold all of this in, because if I talk like this in person that would be super self-pitying and shitty. Idk what to do"
depression,ffdsnfq,t1_ffdrwbc,1579827916.0,"It's just that feels contradictory to most anything I've heard. No one is entitled to sex and love. And no woman's gunna feel sorry for a guy and date him, when they could just as easily find someone who doesn't have issues. And expressing anxiety and frustration over it makes you entitled. So I do everything in my power not to make a fuss of it outside of my head."
