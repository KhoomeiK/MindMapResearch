Gender roles are pointless and irrelavent. They way people use them as if they would a shirt is insulting to my actual trans firend. She was a US ranger named Steve until she became Sue. Nice person she is about 60 and gets very angry at these people are who call themselves trans and 'change their gender with the wind'.
Personally i think intersexed expressions are a waste of time, i dont care about your shirts and shoes.

People are so eager to say its 100% trump which its very likely to not be, and it annoys me. ""ClintonBodyCount"" started in the 90s before 'right wing' became a pejorative. It being a conspiracy also is not really important, just to have that on you in from that time peroid means a lot, when a potential career ender just randomly dies in the most boomer way.

tapes were erased by ""accident"", and he broke his neck in the way only people are who choked out break their neck and not at all like the way hanged people break theirs.

Trump is a bad person, honestly i dont see him be a child predator, but it could be him. It also could have be Bill, hell it could be Biden we all know how much that creep loves to sniff kids hair. Kevin Spacy was also on there we know he has issues with kids. Alan Dershowitz has been on his fight hunderds of times. 

while looking for other names Clintons last fight was 2016, trumps was apparently 2005 from when he was banned from the island for ""assulting a underaged girl"".  which is 3 years after he called him a ""terrific guy"". Again im not saying Trump didnt do it, im saying other people are just as likely if not more. 

Side note: Alex Jones called out pedo Epsiten 1 year before any of this came to light. On the Joe Rogan Podcast he had Alex Jones on and during his madman rants he said something about the ""big and powerful going to pedo island with Epstein on the leyotta express."""
