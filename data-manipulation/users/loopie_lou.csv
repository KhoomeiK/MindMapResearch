Jeep,ffgz9nn,t1_ffg3r8y,1579918904.0,"You can get yourself some cheap equipment through CL, FB marketplace or Harbor Freight. 

If you have to work outside, a canopy tent with walls, a small space heater and some tarps from any big box store or any other cheap source you can find will help big time with comfort and protection. Just work in the back yard or behind a privacy fence to avoid headaches.

My dad and brother made a living as shady tree mechanics and neither ever had a shop. They both used tarps and tents year round."

overlanding,fesidnt,t1_feovkc5,1579365482.0,"This is tame compared to what we do to some Wranglers at a festival called “Las Mascaras” in Hatillo, Puerto Rico. We traditionally use suped up custom floats but there are clubs that strictly use Wranglers as their base for some really flamboyant floats. It’s a hell of a wild time for anyone interested. Check it out on YouTube, you won’t believe what most of these floats and even the Wranglers are capable of."

Unfortunately, Puerto Rico is stuck in a political mire that keeps it from being recognized either as a state or a nation. As a proud Puerto Rican, when asked my nationality I say, without pause, Puerto Rican, same as any other Boriqua you’ll ever meet.

Check FB marketplace and CG religiously and you will find a good deal on a good cabinet saw. You just have to be patient. 

If you travel overseas, hit up any artist communities, bazaars and/or second hand stores, they can be a treasure trove for hand tools. It’s also good to check out any local hardware stores for domestic brands. In Prague, I walked out with an almost full set of new Narex mortising chisels and a carving set for almost half what it cost in the US. I just call them souvenirs when the wife starts to complain."
