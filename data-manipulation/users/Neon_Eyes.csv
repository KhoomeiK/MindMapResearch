lostredditors,ffcaex0,t1_ffc1sal,1579795174.0,">too lazy to read what my opinion is about

This man just pulled a ""no u"" lol alright kiddo. If I go to the doctor I'm going to trust what he says more than what a hobo says. Now if there are multiple hobos coming up to me saying the same thing then I might believe them. But while the number of doctors opinions outweighs the number of hobos opinions then I'm going to trust the doctor more. Because it's just an opinion. Not a fact. 

When experts as well as normal people like us disagree with you I'm just going to see you as wrong. Now if the experts said one thing and the normal people like us said another then I would be on the fence. But that's not the way it is. You have multiple thousands of people disagreeing with you.

If you told me the sky was green i would disagree with you because the scientist as well as the normal people say it is blue. 

Now why should I accept your opinion? That's all it is, your opinion. Do I have to agree with everyone's opinion because that wouldn't be possible. Your logic doesn't work with that scenario and you don't have any point really other than ""well even though I'm not an actor I can see bad acting"". Yeah everyone can. But everyone is also saying he isn't a bad actor. Now this is as much as I can spell it out. If you still don't get it at this point then I've lost hope in you."

You can critic stuff. But not better than Holly wood directors and if you can't understand my point now then you must just have some kind of learning disability.
