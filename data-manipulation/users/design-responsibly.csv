I assume you're familiar with the phrase: ""correlation does not imply causation."" If by ""highly successful"" you mean that the church did not fall apart nor was it forced to flee (which had happened repeatedly before), then there were other factors contributing to that. Polygamy increased commitment to the church, but both *isolation* and *top-down control* had a huge amount to do with the church's ""success."" 

>In this sub, using the church and cult in the same sentence is just a way to call the church a cult. Why else mention it?

>Strong community identity is human and healthy and desirable--even when members sacrifice individual autonomy to be a member of the community. Every community imposes burdens on its members.

Yes, we're getting back to my first point: there are many possible ways to create ""strong community identity."" I agree that ""every community imposes burdens on its members."" The challenge then, is to find a good balance between the needs of the community and the needs of the individual. I don't believe polygamy was anywhere close to the best balance. It was beneficial for a few people, but not for many others. And given the church's obvious work in recent decades to distance itself from the very idea of polygamy, it's clear they feel it's hurting the *church* today. Perhaps church leaders will do an about-face and embrace polygamy once again when they perceive it is once more beneficial."

A good example, because our desire for calorie-dense foods is also explained by this being an adaptive trait in our ancestors, who were always on the lookout for a meal. The fact that people like sugar too much today is an unfortunate byproduct, but we don't have to invoke a ""mysterious food force"" or ""mysterious body force."""

>Please leave off with the name calling.

Where did I name call? My point was this: we all recognize that when cults use an extreme ""us vs. them"" mentality, it's for the benefit of the *group* (or group leader) and most definitely *not* for the benefit of the individuals (or do you disagree?). So, when the church used a similar extreme method, this also benefited the group, but at the expense of the individuals.

I'd also mention that this type of extreme ""us vs. them"" mentality (as the church experienced while holding off the federal government) is similar to methods used by *cults* to socially isolate their members from those outside.

The church uses the words ""humble yourself"" as a euphemism for ""reject yourself."" I'm also not remotely excited about a test of this type, and yet it seems to be the end goal for many church members, constantly working to follow the prophet no matter how their own conscience would have them do otherwise.

Of course, when the answer is always to ""humble yourself,"" it makes it impossible to ever conclude that the church or its leaders could be wrong. It's always *you* who are wrong. How often do we hear exhortations for President Nelson to humble himself, stop his pride, and accept what others are telling him?

Most believers claim that you *don't* have to simply ""accept everything,"" because you can pray about it and find out *that it's from God*. Unfortunately, the only answer to prayer they accept as legitimately from God is a *confirmation* that whatever the church leader is saying is true.

This is false, utterly, totally, and completely.” He further stated that we cannot be saved unless we believe that the “truth as revealed to and taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith is that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent.” McConkie belittled those who think otherwise as having “the intellect of an ant and the understanding of a clod of miry clay in a primordial swamp.”"

This matches my own experience with almost 20 years of married life. The ""check the boxes"" mentality that comes with the emphasis on completing rituals stifled my own development and that of my marriage. What is the step in God's plan after temple marriage? *Endure to the end*.

It's only recently, after leaving the church (my wife is still an active believer), that I'm starting to understand how much *more* there can be to a marriage. The church's teachings basically amounted to: ""Keep your covenants. Have daily prayer and scripture study as a couple. Attend the temple together."" And it's simply **assumed** that all will be well.

However, those things really only point you toward the *church* (or toward God, from church members' perspective), rather than toward each other. Sure, you're doing church activities together, but your personal growth and growth as a couple is extremely limited, because there is *so much more* to a healthy marriage than ""checking the boxes."""

After more thought, I don't see how it's rational to ignore *others'* experiences with priesthood blessings and instead limit your conclusions to your own experiences alone. Even if I had an impossibly remarkable 100% success rate (and a corresponding 0% failure rate) with serious injuries/illnesses, I couldn't rationally conclude that the healings are due to an ""external priesthood power"" rather than some ""internal magical ability"" I possess, or special technique I'm using, or *something else completely unforeseen*, etc. (This also applies in reverse: even if I fully believed my recoveries were due to my ""own special technique,"" they might very well have actually been caused by the priesthood blessing, *no matter how confident I am* in my special technique.)

However, if I included the experiences of others who also have remarkable success rates, and the only thing we apparently have in common is administering priesthood blessings, then it would be more reasonable to conclude that priesthood power is the cause of the healings.

>Yes, to this part. It would be illogical to conclude from the mere existence of x and y that z was not a divine event, unless there is more involved. 

I agree that the existence of x and y says nothing at all about z. It's theoretically possible for a medicine to cause a recovery, and it's possible for meditation to cause a recovery, and it's possible for a priesthood blessing to cause a recovery. They are (or at least could be) independent of each other. 

You said you agreed with this:

>Our task is to determine which recoveries are caused by the particular medicine, which are caused by meditation, and which are caused by the priesthood blessing. 

Rather than categorizing, I see our task as determining *how much* *effect* each supposed cause actually has on the recovery. I don't feel it's safe or justified to assume from the outset that a particular medicine *must be* the cause of *some* recovery, just as I don't feel it's safe or justified to assume from the outset that the priesthood blessing *must be* the cause of *some other* recovery. How can I avoid incorrect conclusions if I start from the assumption that priesthood blessings definitely cause at least some healings? I would be just as incorrect if I start from the assumption that priesthood blessings are 100% bogus.

If data (from a research study) shows that a medicine has no effect on recovery, then I'm unlikely to use that medicine. If data shows that a medicine appears responsible for recovery, then I'm likely to use it. Maybe the study shows that a medicine explains 40% of the recovery while priesthood blessings explain 30%, with the remainder unknown. In that case, I'd likely choose both the medicine *and* the blessing, and I'd fully expect they'd both improve my chances."

I'm not sure exactly what you're saying here, but as I asked before: I assume you don't believe that blessings would fail the test?

>Further, merely saying (as you have done repeatedly) that miraculous events might happen without a blessing is not sufficient 

I'm not saying that ""miraculous"" events happen without a blessing. I'm saying that *recovery* events happen without a blessing, which we both know is true.

>This is because one such miraculous event could be a miracle while the other could be due to other causes.

>The question is how to determine which is which.

I think this might be where we are misunderstanding each other. It sounds like you are saying this:

""Some recoveries happen because of *x* and some happen because of *y* and some happen because of *z*. *X* might be \[a particular medicine\], while *y* might be \[meditation\], while *z* might be a priesthood blessing. *Each of these causes* is valid and reliable in their effects on recovery. Our task is to determine which recoveries are caused by the particular medicine, which are caused by meditation, and which are caused by the priesthood blessing. Just as *I* have no problem accepting that some recoveries are caused by a particular medicine, I don't know why *you* have a problem accepting that some recoveries are caused by a priesthood blessing.""

Am I summarizing your position correctly?"
