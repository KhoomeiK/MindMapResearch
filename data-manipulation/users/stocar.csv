AskReddit,ffyh663,t1_ffwzj7z,1580346325.0,"I’m a nurse. There’s a saying “nurses eat their young” which is, essentially, older nurses shitting on younger nurses/new grads for not finishing school and magically knowing everything. It’s getting better, but there’s a lot of crusty nurses that would rather gripe about the new kid than take that time to explain something. Like okay Karen not going to help you access your email then."

datingoverthirty,ffy636p,t3_evn6nu,1580339264.0,"Also 33F and I get you. My longest relationship was a year, but he was no good. My parents- while good people- had a very fractured relationship with each other, so I grew up not knowing how a normal functioning relationship works. I’m also independent, and feel like obligatory sex or vulnerability is a turnoff, because while I’m capable of these things and like them, the *expectation* weighs heavily on me. I’m also in therapy to overcome this, but it’s a process. 

No words of advice, just saying I feel you. Let me know if you find anything that helps."
datingoverthirty,ffy5ebt,t1_ffy568y,1580338878.0,"It’s tough, because finding a connection that good is rare. But the inconvenience of dating someone that far really takes a toll (usually one or both become stressed/resentful of the commute). I don’t like long intense dates, especially at the beginning, but I also don’t want to date someone I’m not compatible with just for convenience. What to do?"
datingoverthirty,ffy47r1,t1_ffwj43x,1580338230.0,"I’m this girl that lives in a small studio downtown. I could move further out but then I’d have a long commute to work, leave all my friends in the area, have to drive instead of walk to grocery stores, purchase a car instead of use the skytrain, and would no longer be close to picturesque walking trails along the beach. I grew up in suburbs and all I did was eat, sleep and drink. My quality of life has improved since moving into the city, I just have to take a financial hit and live in a smaller space. Worth it (to me)."
CasualConversation,ffy37sl,t1_ffwgg4h,1580337695.0,"All the prom dates with the Down syndrome kid makes me cringe and feel kinda sad knowing that it wasn’t for the kid, but for the benefit of the popular person to “feel good about themselves.” They probably don’t even talk after that :("
datingoverthirty,ffy2nnw,t3_evm8gf,1580337396.0,"I live downtown in a HCOL city. I choose to because I don’t have a car, my work is close, I’m within walking distance to restaurants, stores, the beach, etc. People that live in the suburbs have different lifestyles and priorities. For example, I don’t have a car and work 12 hour shifts as a nurse, so for me to commute an hour each way on top of 12 hours is draining, and parking/driving would be difficult and expensive. I also like to walk around the paths near the beach and I find suburban car people find it undesirable to walk even a few blocks. I also like the convenience of being close to everything.

Currently, I’m (trying to) date someone from the suburbs. He lives an hour+ away so our “dates” are generally long or overnight situations, which I find stressful. No grabbing a quick dinner or going for a nice walk, everything is such a big deal. I also have to pay/register for him to use my visitors parking or take the (1.5 hour) train to him. There are also different expectations or mindsets, like he doesn’t understand why my place is smaller or why I don’t have insuite laundry for what I pay. Honestly I’d rather date some closer that shares my lifestyle."
90DayFiance,ffy0269,t3_evpdb9,1580335844.0,I genuinely wonder if Syngin sees these and it changes his opinion of her. Like how would you feel if the world saw your partner as a selfish psycho and made memes about it? Lawrd.
holdmyfries,ffxy1nk,t3_evrdky,1580334661.0,I’m a nurse and never eat the food at the desk because I’ve seen nurses/healthcare professionals do exactly this without washing their hands and it horrifies me.
