death,ffab8gt,t1_ff9vmnr,1579731502.0,"perhaps we all live in constant denial of just ""not exisiting"", therefore we lean towards an afterlife. I mean, why wouldn't we, right? 

&#x200B;

On the other hand, it's not fair to say an afterlife is stupid because it's ""unscientific"" considering no one living has ever been clinically dead. When I say clinically dead, I mean dead for good. None of this near death experience, clinically dead but then came back to life  - that's dying with extra steps, so how can we say for sure that there was nothing? 

&#x200B;

I feel as if an afterlife is fuelled by our hunger to know that the unknown is nothing to fear. But no one can say for sure what will happen. So, we may as well take the realities we have now, and live them to the max potential. Who knows what comes next?"
