UmbrellaAcademy,fgl9plk,t3_ez4s0s,1580887222.0,"I think they are and are not. By that I mean that no one particular character embodies any one particular sin but they all to one degree or another tell a tale of how the sins connect. 

Vanya is Envy (jealous of her siblings),  Wrath (tries to destroy the world because a dead man lied to her and tricked her siblings into doing so as well) and Gluttony (whatever makes her feel good about herself she instantly indulges to the extreme) 

Allison is Pride (the idea that she deserves the things she gets with her powers) and Greed (when she doesn't get what she wants with her actual talents and so on, she steals it using her powers),  Gluttony (she's never really satisfied with what she has) and Lust (it's implied that she may have forced people into relationships with her that they didn't want or didn't fully consent to, hooking up with Luthor while still technically married).

With the exception of Pride, an argument could be made that Klaus embodies all the sins but it may or may not be offset by the fact that he actively chooses to embody them because he feels so otherwise worthless.

Diego is Envy (is envious of Luthor's position both as team leader and in the family), Pride (feels massively undervalued by his family and thinks he is above the law), Wrath (waves hand at Diego's anger management issues).

Luthor is Pride (always assumes he is right/in the right, thinks being sent frivolously to the moon is the WORST thing that any of them had to deal with in that time frame), Wrath (attacks anyone who disagrees with him, throws a temper tantrum and runs off to do drugs when he finds out his dad is a piece of shit which puts Klaus directly in harms way, rude as fuck to Klaus who is just trying to help when he is actually angry at Hargreeve) Lust (takes a drugged girl home and it is implied he had sex with her, hooking up with Allison while she is still technically married). 

Number 5 is Pride (thinks everyone except himself is useless), Wrath (actively seeks to kill people he thinks has wronged him once he feels their usefulness has ended), envy (feels he has been cheated at every turn, regardless of the veracity, and wants a life like his siblings had)

as for Ben, I need to rewatch the series because I don't remember enough about him to write a good synopsis of his sins as he mostly exists in my head as ""the other cute one with the tentacles and consistent attitude of 'done with everyone's shit' ""  His Character was not as well developed as everyone else."

 When I was a kid my mom could clothe me and my 3 sisters for the entire school year, including jackets and shoes, for just over $100. Then it suddenly became trendy to shop at thrift stores and now i am seeing some secondhand clothes that are nearly the same cost as brand new, regardless of condition, just because  of the name on the tag. 

Also, a special fuck you to the extra skinny people who buy the best clothes from the already tiny plus size sections and cut them up to resew into usually  pretty mediocre new outfits."
