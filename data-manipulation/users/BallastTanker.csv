In time, those memories will mostly be about good things. Give yourself that time."

Not to say you have no right to be upset, you do. My own mother's reaction to me being depressed, coming home from school and curling up in bed to cry daily, was to burst in the door and ask ""What's wrong with you?"" Like I had any idea.

Find someone to talk to. Someone who will validate your feelings and really listen. I wish you brighter days."
ChronicIllness,fe9g9f1,t3_eiihop,1578937243.0,"I have left vocal cord paralysis. Couldn't speak for 18 mos until I had surgery to place an implant. Before my voice was gone, it would come and go like there was a short in the power line. Yeah, that was the nerve shorting out. No bueno."

Gum, tabloids, a deck of cards. Those are my big 3. A bag of M&Ms for when I feel like I'll die without chocolate. A good friend brought me a pressure point massager once, and then used it on my back and shoulders the same evening. I'm always fluid restricted and on the blandest of diets, so a single bottle of my favorite soda is always appreciated. I generally don't have visitors (no family), but it sounds like your friend will. When she is in a regular room, a tray of goodies that she can offer to visitors and/or nursing staff might make her feel like a good ""hostess"".

Oh, and a pencil for the tabloid crosswords. And baby magic bath wash for sponge baths. And a silly cap and or hair ties, it sucks to be unable to wash your hair.

eta: If her ""thing"" is what I am thinking, maybe some ozium or room deodorizing spray?"
offmychest,fe975pq,t3_eo0868,1578935007.0,"Oh my friend, I am so sorry. My father passed a few years ago with dementia, and I know for a fact that he was helped along in his last hours with a heavy dose of morphine. I felt the same, and was angry about it. I did not join my mother and siblings at his bedside. No regrets there, I had been saying my goodbyes for months while sitting at his bedside. It was an act of mercy, and he would have wanted it that way. 

The rehab you speak of...while I don't doubt the fact that miracles can happen, I worked in rehab. Saw some pretty miraculous stuff  happen there. I also followed a patient to her home on hospice as a private duty nurse, and watched her body deteriorate for 2 years. If she had suddenly come out of the coma, her rehab would have been painful. Hands were contracted, she had foot drop, etc.

It is going to be hard. Four years later, I am still so sad about my father and what happened to him. I have to remind myself how awful the last few months of his life really were. He has no more pain now. 

I wish you peace."
offmychest,fe7h0xg,t3_enql4p,1578914410.0,"To OP and some of the commenters: Be open with your feelings! Show how much you care. If you find out right away that your person is put off by it, you may be sparing yourself deeper pain in the future. I've found that happiness doesn't usually come in lifetimes, it comes in moments. Marinate in those moments."

offmychest,fdxdrj9,t3_enan5b,1578767724.0,"More of us out here want the same things than have them, love. Lots of us put up the wall, put on the strong face, etc. Some of us will never find that love and companionship. All of us have our own baggage, our own pain. My best advice for you would be to be kind to everyone. One day, someone will see that kindness, and the beautiful person inside you. As far as the hookups go, they serve a purpose. Maybe you can try NOT going there, and just cuddling next time. It is what you crave, right?"

offmychest,fdvjctx,t3_en6uc3,1578748007.0,"It's nearly impossible to change the way you interact with the people who have treated you this way in the past. Through no fault of your own, you have given them permission to be selfish. Moving forward, make new rules for yourself. Repeat a new mantra in your head, 50/50 or nothing. Dutch treat or hit the street. Meet me halfway or go away. Be firm with yourself. Do this with every new person who enters your life. When you get really good at it, maybe you will gain the confidence you need to demand it from the old friends. Good luck to you, friend."

offmychest,fdj593g,t3_elnaun,1578458809.0,"Lawyer up, too. Perhaps, in the best interests of the children, you can come to an agreement with their father about custody sharing. The person inhabiting your daughter's skin is an unfit parent right now. She needs her actions to have consequences. Would you have let her come home (in hindsight) if there were not children involved? They are her ticket right now to manipulate you.

Not forced, he went out of his way to lighten and lift me up, and I saw the joy it gave him when my eyes lit up. We are both pretty serious people, and this was genuine. He appreciates all of my emotions, but I see love and joy on his face when I smile at him. Nothing beats a vicious circle of smile. The world needs more of them."

What you posted could have come from the person I love more than life itself. He is having depression issues, and has ghosted me for months. I would do anything to listen to him tell me how he is feeling. I always found that a problem shared was a problem halved. Please do get some help from a therapist. Oh, and your fish don't care if the tank is pretty, just that you keep the water clean and their tummies full. 

For what it's worth, I wish I could hug you and tell you that it gets better. Big, big hug."

Teach your new family how you wish to be treated by being genuine and open. My own parent only knows how to show love with money and things. I give no fucks about money and things. I am dying (literally) and my mother thinks she can buy it away with $$$.  I know of her history, and why she is that way, but it is an explanation and not an excuse to continue being cold.

Money and things come and go, and really don't matter in the end, but youth and energy...make time to enjoy them. Your mind and body will thank you for it.
