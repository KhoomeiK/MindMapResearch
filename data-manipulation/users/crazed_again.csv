askgaybros,ffijl2f,t3_ettbsg,1579975411.0,"If you have Grindr, use it! The other day I was in the airport and a guy talked to me and we met for coffee and chatted a bit (we didn’t hook up). Can be nice."
berghain,ffggh5s,t1_ffg6lf4,1579905689.0,"From my experience if they ask you if you’ve been there before (happened only once with me) it means they already half decided to let you in, just be chill and honest."
berghain,fff9ha8,t1_fff6jk5,1579879007.0,"Don’t be, it’s just a club after all. And since you live in Berlin you can always try again."
askgaybros,fff6cke,t3_etaqyd,1579876841.0,"I go out by myself quite often when I’m travelling. I recommend it, it’s a nice way of getting out of your comfort zone. Sometimes it’s a bit awkward, sometimes you meet nice people and sometimes you don’t. You just have to try it."
berghain,fff5qs1,t1_fff58bm,1579876399.0,Let us know if you made it!
berghain,fff4phi,t3_etal6u,1579875634.0,"No make-up, try to look stylish but at the same time not going out of your comfort zone too much, they can detect who’s being fake very easily. Be yourself and don’t get nervous. I always tell people that the most important thing while in line is not to stay focused on the door watching who’s getting in or not - they’re already watching you at the point where you’re close to the door and you don’t want to seem too eager. Forget there are bouncers and other people until you’re in front of them. Good luck.

Edit: if there’s no line just walk with confidence as if you already been there before and you belong, don’t hesitate."
berghain,fff4aa1,t1_ffeeq89,1579875317.0,Good one.
askgaybros,ffdy7zf,t3_et3bpk,1579831890.0,"I’ve been with one Indian and one Phillipino guy and they were hoooot.

Edit: not at the same time."
askgaybros,ffdxwzr,t3_et3jzh,1579831672.0,I’d never meet someone without seeing their face first. Never. Nope.
askgaybros,ffdx5sg,t3_et0m9x,1579831132.0,"I might be redundant here, but I lived in LA for 3 years and almost only had bad experiences with dating. It was really awful. I think I managed to date two guys for 2-3 months but all the other ones didn’t want to get past the third date. Sex was easy, but anything more than that was just impossible. And I consider myself an above average looking guy, educated and with a nice job.

I second the person who suggested you travel more. Or even move somewhere else if that’s a possibility. Yes, if this is affecting you so much why not make it a priority and start fresh somewhere else?

I’m sure you don’t have any problems. It’s LA. That place is just horrible for dating. I moved to Europe and feel much happier here, got myself a boyfriend who loved me (sadly we broke up because I couldn’t feel the same way, but that’s another story) and travelled to many places and met amazing people. People in Europe are much more laid back.

Really, consider other places."
askgaybros,ffdvbco,t3_et33eg,1579829824.0,You’re a horrible person.
askgaybros,ffd82o8,t3_eszeaq,1579815241.0,"I like walking around if the weather is nice. You can grab coffee and explore a neighborhood, walk by the river (if you live in Europe I guess lol). You can chat but it’s not as awkward as sitting across someone and having to make eye contact all the time."
askgaybros,ffd7q1b,t3_eszpzf,1579815044.0,"I’m not gonna sugarcoat it, it does sound like you’re being ghosted. It sucks, I know."
AskReddit,ffd73bs,t1_ffd6bnw,1579814699.0,So sorry to hear that. I’m sure your good girl is in a better place playing with other doggos in dog heaven.
