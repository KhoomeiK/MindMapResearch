I use calendar, google keep, omega 3 fishoil, that makes me sleep better, but still often unfocused and mentally tired, easily affected by diet, such a bummer. After becoming stressed I don't even see a point in staying away from unhealthy food, so I have to avoid those places, I'm probably missing something... Be patient with yourself, I'm not listening to my controlling, sceptic/ignorant parents. You know yourself better than anyone. Having short and longterm plans. Honestly idk what else to say, you are INTJ you got it:D"
