depression,fefml07,t3_cml6ni,1579059581.0,"I always stay up too late and can’t get myself to wake up. All I want in life is to be forgotten. Life is pointless, and I don’t understand how so many people can go about their days with fake smiles.
 
All that I see in people is their sadness, and how everyone tries to fit in with each other, when really they all hate their lives.

I wish I could just fast forward 10 years. I wish I could live a new life, be a new person, maybe then I would care. But I don’t. I can’t.

I don’t believe in God, so hate me, I don’t really care. I’ve just lost all hope in my life.

The only reason I’m still here is because of my parents, my family. I love them so much and I know I could never tell them about my mental condition or self harm, I can picture the look in my mother’s and my father’s eyes. I can see the pain I would cause them, yet I still can’t bring myself to try and make them happy. I feel distanced from the world every day. I grow apart from my family, from what few friends I have.

I feel as though I’m living an autonomous life, like every day is just a horrible repeat of the last. Everything is just a blur. I can hardly remember a few short years ago, when I was happy, when I had normal kid problems like a crush. But I just can’t seem to picture my life getting any better, all I can see is the pain in people’s eyes.

I’d say I’m fairly intelligent. I’m fact, I’m that annoying know-it-all you all hate for rubbing their “logic” in other people’s faces. And I hate myself for it. Whenever someone says something just slightly off, or I overhear a question in someone else’s conversation, it’s instinct to give my 2 cents, and I always catch myself afterwards thinking, “Why am like this? What brought me to putting others down, to losing my sense of humor?”

I already mentioned this, but my friends are growing apart from me. Specifically my best friend. He is depressed as well, and has an...interesting past. He liked a bi girl, they are now very good friends. He is apparently pansexual now, and has been dating a transgender guy for a few weeks now. He stopped sitting with me at lunch a few months ago, and we don’t have any classes together. I wish he would acknowledge me, yet he just walks by, full of life, laughing. I’m happy for him, that he doesn’t seem as depressed, but I miss him as well.

I’m not looking for your sympathy, in fact I would be amazed if you weren’t already bored out of your mind reading yet another “millennial’s self-diagnosed depression story.” And I have tried to put myself out there, to get better. I recently asked a girl out, she had liked me before winter break, and over the break I tried to text her often. I asked her out on the first day of school, but she rejected me. I suppose it’s alright, I don’t really like her friends anyway, and even when we did hang out before I felt invisible, she would just talk to her friends. But no. She wouldn’t have me.

I just feel unwanted, as though life is a waste of time. I don’t want to kill myself now. My family would miss me too much. And I’m too much of a damned coward to do it anyway. 

Thank you for reading. I wish you all the best of luck. Goodbye."
