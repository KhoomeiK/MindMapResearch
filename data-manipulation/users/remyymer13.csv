She loves tennis balls and toys that make crinkly noises. She's the most adorable, lovable pup out there, but she's frustrating at times. She's an amazing dog though! She's so smart and well behaved. She's growing fast but doesn't seem to realize it. She's clumsy and uncoordinated and loves to lay on top of you when you're trying to get work done.

I got a MacBook Pro for school and bought The Sims 4 and haven't gotten it to work even once. As much as I love my Mac, PCs are definitely superior when it comes to gaming, even for games like the Sims.

I miss playing The Sims lol"

I tried several times to get her interested in chasing a tennis ball, but she would never chase it. One day I took her out to play and started playing with the ball again- and she was suddenly interested in it! I took this picture while she was trying to get the ball."
service_dogs,fenaubj,t3_eq19tp,1579280722.0,"I got my SDiT as a 4 month old puppy. She was old enough that I knew more about her personality and temperament and she had already started obedience training, but not so old that she had developed too many bad habits that I had to break. She's still a puppy, so she's still a bit of a handful at times, but she's also old enough that it's a bit easier than dealing with a 9 week old baby pup.

Personally, I'd recommend getting a dog that's 6 months old at the youngest, but not older than 1.5-2 years, and that's already had some obedience training. You won't have to focus so much on obedience training yourself, but can start teaching your dog tasks to help you around the home. (Of course, adopting a dog that's already started obedience training doesn't mean that they're going to be perfect, so you should still plan on working on obedience training as well!)

I wish you the best of luck on your ESA journey and hope I could help!"
service_dogs,fen9jfm,t3_epy07e,1579279917.0,"* My SDiT is supposed to mature to around 80 pounds, and it's looking like she might end up being bigger than that. Obviously she's still an SDiT and not fully grown, so I can't really answer your question about size. However, something that's important for large SDs is a really good 'tuck'. They have to be able to curl up to fit in smaller spaces, like under a chair or table or on an airplane.
* Most SDiTs wear vests that clearly state that they're in training and usually also have noticeable patches or embroidery saying not to pet or distract them. My SDiT wears a vest that says that she's in training and I have a leash sleeve saying not to distract her. [My SDiT's vest/gear.](https://imgur.com/a/k1aE9oh) It's not really ""supposed"" to say anything, because in the US a vest isn't legally required. It can say whatever you want. However, many people use it as a tool for training (teach the dog that wearing vest = working) or to notify the public that your SD is working and shouldn't be distracted.
* Some handlers actually let people pet their SDs (with permission, of course). It's up to you. There are many ways to tell people not to pet your dog. Some people stop and take the time to explain ""My dog is working, so petting him isn't allowed."" Still, there's nothing rude about just saying ""No, you can't pet him"" and moving on with your day. People can be hard to deal with, though. And lots of people feel like they're entitled to pet any dog they want, or that all they need to do is ask and they'll be allowed to. To get my SDiT to regain focus after a distraction, I get her to sit and then I give her the ""look at me"" command and it usually does the trick. If we start walking away and she's still too excited/distracted, I do this again until she's calm and focused again.
* There isn't a super clear point when a dog goes from being an SDiT to an SD. It's kind of up to the handler and trainer to decide when the dog is ready, since there's no certification or test in the US. I once saw something that someone said about ""graduating"" their SDiT to an SD and I found it really helpful. The handler said that they were going to 'officially' call their dog an SD because they had reached a point where if they stopped training right then and only worked, the dog would still be able to perform well. I'm not sure if I explained it well enough, but it made sense when I heard it the first time.

Something I'd like to add is that if public access training doesn't work out for your dog, you can still train him as an in-home service dog. He won't go places with you, but he'll still be task trained to help mitigate your disability. For some people, this is actually the way to go anyway, especially if their disability doesn't require many tasks in public.

I hope I was able to help answer your questions. And they weren't stupid questions! It makes me so happy to see someone that wants to do this right and is doing the research rather than just putting their dog in a vest and saying that they're in training. I wish you and your pup the best!!"

If you’re worried about being able to access medication kept in a pack on his gear, try getting gear that covers a large surface area so it covers his fur and keeps it from interfering with your access, if that makes sense.
Good luck!"
