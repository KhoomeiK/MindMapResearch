GoT overall (I read all of the books that were out and most of the show but gave up when it got boring) has less rapes. I only really remember Sansa and Daenarys being raped. Oh and Cersei. All but Sansa's were ""soft"" non-violent rapes if that makes sense. I do remember I wasn't nearly as triggered."
Outlander,ff98k7s,t1_ff97xur,1579707329.0,"> No Claire isn’t raped by the redcoat.

Are you sure? I remember she like disassociates and is in shock after and Jamie refers to not being able to stop him. I thought he was mid-rape when she stabbed him.

And I haven't read the books but I'm honestly thinking about it! They just seem loooong and I might be a little over-saturated with Outlander lol.

I'd like to hear her reasoning too. From what I've heard from other comments the rape scenes are a lot less graphic in the books (particularly the BJR/Jamie rape). Frankly, most of my history knowledge isn't as detailed as to know what goes on in day to day life. I know like 3/4 of women currently have been sexually assaulted or raped and of those somewhere between 70-80% are likely to be revictimized. So it *does* happen. And there's a lot less rape in the ""civilized"" societies (Paris, 1940s, 1960s) but I really feel like it's not painting the Scots well. I'm fine with a few generally bad dudes/villains, but it just seemed so matter of course.

Also, yeah, fuck Geillis, she's awful."

Outlander,ff94ixr,t1_ff93m7h,1579704658.0,"Wasn't Claire raped in Season 1 by a redcoat right after her and Jamie got married and then she stabbed him? And I'd argue being forced to have sex with Louis XV constitutes rape. I think I'd be okay with BJR just being horrible rapist dude but there's a lot more than just him.

I'm going off of memory so forgive me.

Season 1:

* BJR attempts to rape Claire, Murtagh saves her.
* Someone in Dougal's crew threatens to rape Claire, Dougal is like nah.
* 3 dudes in the hall at Colum's manor try to rape Claire, Dougal stops them
* Then Dougal tries to rape Claire
* Red coat soldier rapes Claire. She stabs him.
* BJR tries to rape Claire, Jamie stops him.
* BJR rapes Jamie (which the show turned into an *extremely* uncomfortable torture porn thing).
* As you said, BJR almost rapes Jenny, forgot about that.

Season 2:

* Fergus is raped by BJR
* Mary is raped by the Sandringham's croney, Claire almost raped.
* Claire is raped in a quid pro quo with Louis XV.
* A multitude of horrifying flashbacks to Jamie's rape.

Season 3:

* Jamie is raped by annoying girl he works for
* Ian is raped by Geillis. 
* I honestly can't remember if Claire is almost raped in this season or not.

I just started season 4 and someone attempts to rape her in the FIRST episode. It's just... idk, it's a fuckin' lot.

edit: sorry, forgot my point. I think a lot of the rapes are just like ""Ur a woman, I'mma rape you"" rather than just as a weapon and maybe that *is* historically accurate, but all of Dougal's crew and Colum's house are supposed to be Scotland's concept of gentry, right? The whole Sandringham thing of ""don't kill them just rape them"" is fucking bizarre. Why not just beat the shit out of them? Geillis being a rapist of young virgin men (especially because she's from the 1960s) is just beyond the fucking pale."
Outlander,ff81rhr,t1_ff7xuxp,1579663726.0,I’m just not so sure it *was* reality. Maybe like one Claire rape and an attempted rape and Jamie being coerced by that annoying girl but the rest of them just seem like fetishized sexual violence. Eeeeeverytime they’re in peril someone tries to rape Claire. I really feel like at some point I’d start carrying weapons.
Outlander,ff7mfxk,t1_ff7m1q3,1579653051.0,"Oh jeez, that is sad. I literally just watched the scene between Jamie and Ian in the first episode of season 4 and at least they’re having some good rhetoric around it."

I actually have used this strategy. It doesn't bother me if people think I'm a ""slut"" and it does actually weed out misogynists. I won't disclose my number to ""good"" men or people I know have low body counts. I guess I really only do it to shock people into not dating me lmao."

When I subscribed I was really worried this was going to be like Red Pill Women (who internalize all the fucked up shit Red Pill says about women and try to play *that* game) but this sub is *so* fucking empowering and truthy. 

And I also think ""high value"" can be subjective or ""negotiable"" in some ways. There are certain ways in which I'm ""low value"" (I'm overweight and I smoke, etc.). That doesn't mean I have no value as a person and I could change those things if I wanted to and I'm high value in a lot of different ways (have a fantastic job, am funny and caring, have a lot of life skills, etc.). So for me this sub has kind of opened my eyes to what I *am* willing to negotiate on and what I'm *not* and empowered me to know that, say that, and not accept anything else!"
AskReddit,fe8q2kb,t3_eny414,1578929176.0,"Y'all are posting some minor league shit.

LPOTL is currently on Bob Berdella who used to tie up men in his attic, electrocute them, torture them for as long as 17 hours straight, sodomize them with lots of different things including carrots and cucumbers and literally fisted a guy to death.

Then you've got Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo who raped and killed 3 or 4 girls in Canada. Including Karla's little sister.

BTK was a bungler but I think the part where he hangs people up and masturbates onto them (including the kids) disturbed me quite a bit.

Dean Corll was pretty bad. Lots and lots of boy-rape and murder.

Robert Pickton raped and killed sex workers and had his pigs eat them.

Jerry Brudos raped and killed a lot of women... for their feet. I'll let you fill in the gaps.

AskReddit,fdk53ht,t1_fdjkh0t,1578496254.0,"I went because of a bf accusing me of being co-dependent. And tbf, I *was*. But I had a massive amount of PTSD and an anxiety disorder and depression from being in a previous abusive relationship so CoDA always felt like ""fluff work"" that I was doing. Meds are what I really needed and saved my life, but the work I did in CoDA taught me about boundaries and affirmations and letting go which means I'm capable of a healthy relationship now which is pretty great.

I still occasionally have PTSD issues because that shit doesn't go away, but I've been doing EMDR and bought The Body Keeps The Score which I really need to read.

It's kind of nice looking back at that. I started that journey at 25 and am turning 30 this year. In less than five years I'm so much more stable and happy. I know there's more work to do, but it feels like maintenance rather than urgent. :)"

I will say that last line â€œAfter all this time do you think Iâ€™d let it hurtâ€ gave me the tinglies but would have a lot more so with a deeper relationship and character development. Them being naked and cuddling in her death dream confused the fuck out of me because until that moment they were fucking rivals lol.

I think the issue with a lot of tv writers (Ryan Murphy comes to mind) is that they want to cram ALL of their thoughts on a subject into the last episode. Youâ€™re supposed to start complicated and pare it down like a reverse pyramid so people take away a particular idea or learning or feeling."
