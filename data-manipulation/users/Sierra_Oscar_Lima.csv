>And just because you have a 240v line in your house doesn't mean it's going to work.

I don't understand what you mean except maybe the house doesn't have a 240v receptacle anywhere (IE, no electric range, no electric clothes dryer). All houses in the US are wired with 240v. 

There's two hot leads coming into the house wired to the hot bus bars in the breaker. If a breaker pulls off just one of the two bus bars, you get 120v. If the breaker is wired to both, you get 240v. 

It's not hard to have an electrician add 240v wiring for your burner. I have done it myself.
