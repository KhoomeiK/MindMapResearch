The reason the infighting is a problem it because its cost the Left before. Notably 2016. Rather than backing Bernie, the DNC put Hillary up. She was literally everything he claimed to run against (rich, corrupt career politicians) and was utterly unremarkable. Bernie and Yang are doing pretty well, and are actually pushing for something people recognize (even though I disagree with them, i respect their convictions and efforts). If the democrat party and other leftist groups make a few trade offs and back them,  they actually have a good chance of taking Trump down. 

I also think the amount the word ""facist"" is used is really dumb. Facism is a particular, extremely militant idea that heavily restricts personal freedoms (which would include 2nd ammendment) and is very far right, and niche at that. The vast majority of right, even far right arent facist."

Edit: also, just because someone disagrees with you doesn't make them facist or your sworn enemy. One huge strength of the Republican party is their ability to make value trade offs for what they feel is most important (such as pro-life or 2nd ammendment)"

Your end goal needs to be carriers. Venators, ISDs, etc. They give you lots of fighters without touching the pop cap. They are also heavy enough to brawl and most corvettes and frigates need huge numbers to counter.

[How to bootcamp Windows](https://www.imore.com/how-install-windows-your-mac-boot-camp). But before you do, BACK EVERYTHING UP. Get it on separate flash drives, cloud whatever. You can make a Time Machine backup, but I find it easier to take my important files, wipe and start over.
