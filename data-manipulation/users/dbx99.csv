interestingasfuck,ffcyetj,t1_ffcxwmd,1579809842.0,It wouldn’t take much.  Our joints are very strong in a specific motion while completely fragile when angled slightly off our ergonomic range of motion - which is how martial arts like Jujitsu exploits our innate weaknesses by forcing our limbs into these vulnerable positions in order to disable an opponent
interestingasfuck,ffcy4o0,t1_ffcw0y1,1579809674.0,Adding some lightweight armature and joints could be a good way to offload that stress from the pilot and into some kind of titanium exoskeleton that acts as the arm/shoulder stress bearing structure.  That way the pilot only needs to exert maneuvering motions rather than hold himself up the whole flight.
interestingasfuck,ffcxts7,t1_ffct721,1579809507.0,Good point. It would be good to add an articulated connection to provide support so the arms and shoulder muscles and skeletal system are not bearing the full weight and acceleration.

television,ffb7o95,t1_ffb7asq,1579754141.0,"The counterpoints attacked AA and others calling addiction a “disease” - which of course is problematic.  It’s not like a normal disease since there is a “choice” component within the compulsion and physical/emotional addiction. 

The shortcomings are valid but AA does seem to allow for a broad interpretation of “higher power” so it’s not a strictly religious practice.  I think they basically want to train egocentric perspectives to look to a bigger outward perspective where the individual is a part of a greater universe that does not revolve around the ego."
CrappyDesign,ffb4s16,t1_ffb2ttc,1579751782.0,Not really. That soft foam is fragile and would likely rip at the surface when a sticker is pulled off from it.   It would have to be bagged and the bag would have to be barcoded. That’s added cost.
