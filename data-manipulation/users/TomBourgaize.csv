MechanicAdvice,fflesmm,t1_fflej93,1580038791.0,"Yeah that’s a pretty good interval, every other service basically, we used to offset the cost so one year we’d do oil and filter cabin filter air filter and brake fluid, then the following year we’d do oil and filter fuel filter spark plugs and fluid changes"
MechanicAdvice,ffldv2l,t1_ffld9fz,1580038424.0,"Most ATF is a deep red but you need to remember when they drained and refilled they wouldn’t get all of the old stuff out so a small amount of the brown old stuff will mix.  It’s still clear and it still has the red hue to it so in my opinion it’s perfectly good, I’ve seen ATF come out black as engine oil with no issues to the gearbox, trouble is most places say to change earlier than you need to because it’s easy money for them."

MechanicAdvice,ffkh1uf,t1_ffjz1vt,1580022636.0,"This may seem bad but it’s actually good because you have had an effect so I’m pretty sure it will be that, what you will probably find is by disturbing them more that’s why it’s worse.  If you have some jump leads attach one side to anywhere metal on the engine and the other to the negative battery terminal, make sure the engine one is a good contact and try again"

MechanicAdvice,ffj8off,t1_ffj80df,1579993082.0,"Yeah that will use it so it could be that, if you have somewhere dry you can leave the car running with the AC on full you should see it dripping from near the middle of the car at a steady rate, if you don’t it’s going into the car"
MechanicAdvice,ffj8bm0,t1_ffj7yii,1579992859.0,"Oh okay, so now the ice isn’t there you should be able to move it past the cable popping if you pull it while the motor is working too, you can try to patch the hole but you can’t get anything in the wires as it’ll bind up the motor"

MechanicAdvice,ffj6omp,t1_ffj6j4o,1579991753.0,"My best guess is when it was frozen it caused the cables to compress unevenly and force out through the gap you see, now it’s unfrozen the roof itself should be okay but the cable now has an easier way out that move the glass, can you move the glass with your hand while operation the switch and see if it behaves?"

HomeImprovement,fdrz9wt,t3_emqztw,1578691900.0,"Me my wife and my then 1 year old daughter bought our first home in July ‘17.  Now this was the best house we could get on our tight budget and as of such we weren’t being as picky as we should be.  It looked solid and although it was in drastic need of redecorating we figured both of us are pretty handy so we’d spend the month overlap from our rental doing it.  First on the list was ripping the god awful wallpaper from the walls and for some reason they’d built a random metal track and plasterboard wall in front of the original fireplace and on the rear facing wall, essentially losing is probably 8inches of room from two walls in an already tight lounge.  We spent a day ripping out all the plasterboard and metal tracking with my step dad who had been a carpenter all his life thinking just what had the previous owner had in his mind when paying for this to be done.  Well we found out why fairy soon after, my step dad turned to me and said the sentence no home owner ever wants to hear, “ermm mate, you’ve got dry rot, and it’s bad”.  My heart sank and we wasn’t wrong, the dry rot had taken out 5/6 joists on the first floor, two landings and a staircase, half a bathroom, and much much more.  This month long decoration turned into a three month bank breaking argument causing near marriage ruining nightmare.  You’ll be glad to hear that as of two weeks time the carpet will go down ending the whole saga.
