AgeGapRelationship,fe5t6s7,t3_envhao,1578874398.0,"You'll be surprised how many people won't bat an eyelash about your age gap. My partner is 16 and a half years my senior. I was hesitant about being out with my family and my friends, it took about six months until I was comfortable enough to do so. Family loves him. Friends love him. As long as your relationship is happy and healthy, good on you for finding your person, regardless of age. Wish you the best!"
