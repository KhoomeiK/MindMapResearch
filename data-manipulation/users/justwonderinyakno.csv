misophonia,ffgne2r,t3_etfmyv,1579910285.0,"I started going to an alternate testing center for my exams, which was awesome, but then I shortly realized it meant anyone for any type of test could go there (I was going for math). One day, someone came in mid test I'm assuming taking some sort of ""writing"" test or language exam that required them to type, or essay response, and they were going so long and were typing the most obnoxiously I ever heard in my life, in fact I dont think it was my misophonia that was bothered, I just could not focus for shit because it was so loud and constant, I had a mental break down and started crying (silently) and I could not focus on my exam which I needed to pass to pass the class....my emotions were very overwhleming, I was running out of time just hoping it was only a few questions they were typing to, waiting for the proctor to tell them to be more quiet (as others were typing as well but couldnt hear them, this person clearly was obnoxious) I eventually ended my test and left with such rage that i never wanted to beat the shit out of someone with a keyboard more in my life. but did not, of course.   


For evidence, go to a psycholigist. They are not going to be able to diagnose you with ""misophonia"" but they can definietly give you an excuse/note saying you are mentally unable to  focus in unquiet rooms and requires accommodation. That's all that is honestly needed. Nobody can deny you ""disability accommodations"" it doesn't have to be convincing, just from a doctor."
ucf,fffz60j,t3_etds17,1579894988.0,"I feel some of your pain, but obviously you are in a really rough place and I am so sorry. I think the excess credit hour thing for financial aid purposes is there for the reasoning of allowing everyone that needs it to be able to get their undergraduate degree. I think they just dont want people taking advantage of the system by taking classes they dont need/being able to sneek past and get two degrees done at once, etc. Obviously this is not the case for you but taking the excess credit hour thing would allow people to take advantage of it and may have the adverse affect of lowering the max grants and financial aid people can get to just to accomodate people taking advantage and everyone. There should be another way and appeals should see your struggle and what you are going through to allow you, but I do understand why its in place and policy, they cant make something happen they dont have control over (the people you appeal to/talk to)   


I hope you're able to get the help you need finacially and able to graduate. I myself transffered from a diff state with a ton of credits (not transfferable ofc) but counted and I am worried of the day to come I wont get financial aid. My mom is living paycheck to paycheck as well  since my father died recently and lost half the household income, just to help me with gas and tolls to get to campus as I cannot afford living near and commute an hour and a half and have a job which doesnt help much and does affect studies, which I wish most people would be more understanding of on how these struggles do affect people's studies. No one is superman and can do it all and still be stable. My biggest regret is not being able to spend more time with my dad due to school. I know its what he would want and did want, but not what I wanted.   


With all that being said, I just want you to see you're not the only one struggling, you're not alone in it, and I hope times will change for everyone struggling. Some advice, maybe apply for some scholarships you're eligible for and test your luck. Maybe apply for entry level jobs that offer to pay for school, some examples are chic-fil-a and disney aspire program come to mind.  It's not gonna be easy, but you're not destined to fail, but you are destined to succeed! It will be a long hard road and you'll have to jump over many obstacles but you're gonna get there dude, I 100% believe in you. You seem very resillient and have gone through some shiiiiiit, and you're still here so you gotta keep pushin though and what a success story you will have at the end. Many people think they are in a hole dug way too deep with no way to get out, but there is no hole deep enough you cant climb yourself out of. It'll take time and effort, but you got this. I think a big problem you have at least mentally is putting a timer on it and age mark on it and it seems to be a big issue bothering you. dont look at your age, dont look how much time it takes you, you can only do what you can dude."
bulletjournal,ffeamlw,t3_es4po7,1579841386.0,"I do it! I actually use whitelines notebooks as I can scan them and stack them in the app it has and they also have dotted pages, blank, lines, or graph. I prefer graph for all subjects but I mostly use these for math. It has been a life saver. I split things up by topics and use diff colors for answers type of problem, example etc maybe do a fancy title on top of page. Don’t over do it though bc you’re gonna take too much time on the artsy ness of it and not the content. Simple is key but adding pops of color really helps give it a good feel."
loseit,ffea02j,t3_et0nzt,1579840840.0,"I was I think 270 at 15 at 5’6(f) due to not just diet but health and other things. Honestly my parents did the same thing but it didn’t bother me the way it did you, it more so made me feel a bit embarrassed but I knew they were just trying to make sure I wouldn’t gain further health problems and knew they loved me and it was on me to turn things around. If I can say this a bit blunt, you are saying that if they didn’t watch you so closely you’d be able to do it better...but I feel that is just an excuse for you to not get on it and be healthy or at the least try. I get what they are doing is annoying and you’re still a young teen and growing both physically emotionally and mentally, but it’s gonna be a lot easier to get healthy now than it is later and you’ll have far less health risks. You need to maybe not blame your parents for you not being able to do something and go for it. I would talk to them if it’s bothering you this much and ask them how they can help you or give you ways or solutions to help yourself that way everyone has a better understanding and if they see you try and take advice, they will probably not watch you so closely. They just wanna make sure you’re safe and healthy."

ucf,ffcnb2m,t3_esvixt,1579803094.0,"I wouldn't go through UCF just bc it is gonna be a pain in the ass and probably take you a while to get it/evaluations etc. It is one of the most commonly abused ""controlled"" prescriptions. UCF health services wont even give you adderal unless you have at least 3 years of documented diagnoses/use of adderal, etc.  I'm sure any school would be stingy on any controlled substance, especially in florida. You can go to any regular doctor and get it prescribed for traveling. I have gone to urgent care and got it prescribed for anxiety for traveling (different state though, mind you) You can always call ucf health services and see if they will tell you so you dont waste your time."

HOWEVER, there are good cops too, I just wish there were more of them and that they would stand up for the people they are sworn to protect instead of the cops that dont protect, but harm the people."
ucf,ff46f45,t1_ff44xdq,1579556559.0,"yeah i agree it is the money bc all the reasoning leads to that, maybe they just cant justify it, but tbh I am from out of state and moved here a few years ago and the weirdest thing was the lack of 24/7 stores you have here. In my home state there were 24/7 stores everywhere, fast food places, even some take out resteraunts, and everything was open on sundays without limited hours, i think it could be a florida thing as well LOL"
ucf,ff43u0b,t3_eriwba,1579554939.0,In the little section where they close off from cars in between all the bars and such they tend to have lots of events (usually music related) and set up i think a small stage.
ucf,ff43pd3,t3_erizy9,1579554860.0,"Closing times are usually based on how busy it is/requests (aka how many people WANT it t be open at specific hours) which is how they determine business hours. As someone who works on campus it seems to be a money thing too, in order to stay open more hours they need more employees, which yeah most are student employees and not to expensive, but they need higher positions as well available which means they have to shell out a bunch of money. Is it possible? heck yeah, but do they want to pay more employees out of a fund they could use elsewhere? probably not. I used to also work in the library and I can tell you weekend days and nights are honestly not that popular with the exception of sunday (but that is open till 1am) and nights in general after 7pm are pretty dead unless finals coming up, which happen to have it open later at 3am. They dont want to pay to hire more people for a place that doesnt generate much ""business"" (even tho not really business, but general activity) during specific hours. Im sure they plan hours opened based off the demand. I'm sure there are tons who would make use of it, but consistently/all the time? Most likely not.  With all that being said, 7pm is ridiculously early but it is also usually dead at that time LOL at least when I go there. This is comparing to how it is mid day though which is crazy insane."

ucf,feo9qng,t3_eq4hfe,1579297087.0,"I dont have slow processing disorder, but I do have ADHD and also on adderall. Are you fully adjusted to the amount of medication you need? Because if you aren't that can be affecting the effectiveness.   


For me personally, the only thing that I've found to help me (bc I cant just read and understand the concept myself) is writing notes/scheduling time to do it but make sure you dont do it non-stop because it will just become dreadful. I also decorate my notes tho so it makes it more of a fun process and I can understand visuals/bold colours a lot easier than plain notes, which takes a little extra time of course, but 100% helps me understand concepts a lot more. And before exams or whatever I will go through my notes and rewrite things I dont think i'd remember/understand to review that instead of all my notes.   


With these disorders, i think its more about accepting that you have them, its gonna make you work harder and take longer sometimes, which doesnt feel fair at all because it isnt, and it sucks that you take longer/have to work harder than others sometimes just to grasp basic concepts, but it is what it is and through time you'll find little things that make it easier for yourself and help you. I will say for me, visual's, drawing (even if bad at it) and bold colours help me a lot, so does making studying fun, it makes you ""want"" to do it."
ucf,feo8nhp,t1_fenoc5q,1579296648.0,"Honestly, it seems likely but depending where the scholarship is from I would be more inclined to contact them unless it is from UCF.

But...upon reading the last part of your comment the dude just seems like an ass, damn.

ucf,fek91z0,t3_epelb2,1579195142.0,"It definitely depends which parent is disapproving, their reasoning/stance, and the chances of them being able to warm up about it, knowing them. It also depends how serious it is/if you feel it will continue for the long run, etc. As well as do either of you plan on converting to the other's religion? This is what i see most often, but usually when the person is Jewish and the other is Muslim. It's your choice and should be up to you, HOWEVER I would be very wary only because difference in religions may not be a problem now, but can be later even if you think it wont affect, but in your case it seems it will affect your families as someone disapproves. Sometimes it will be deal-able, but sometimes a parent could potentially not want to deal with it which in the long run can affect the child/relationship as some resentment can form. A good thing to do might be educating yourselves on each other's respective religions and bringing it to the parent who disprove, because a lot of religions have very similar morals/beliefs (other than who is worshiped) and the parent may be more accepting then because a lot of the time they disapprove based on the name/label of the religion itself without knowing why they even disapprove.   


WITH all that being said, it honestly is your decision and anyone elses disapproval doesnt matter, but depends on how bad you want the parent to approve or not, which seems like you do."

ucf,fe03vkd,t3_eni1tp,1578802422.0,"This seems to of happened to quite a few people, I am wondering if maybe the criteria for the pell grant has changed/added something that your criteria may not meet any longer to receive more? I would try to visit financial aid asap but if your finances and income havn't changed in any sense, i would assume the pell grant itself may have new or added criteria.  Other aid you recieve can affect how much of the pell grant you get as well, have you gotten any new scholarships/grants? Did your gpa drop a lot?  ALSO are you sure you aren't reaching your maximum amount of pell grant that can be awarded to you?"
ucf,fdzyis5,t3_enhtvz,1578798909.0,boxi park in lake nona is really cool! I think they open late afternoon-midnight and its like a little area with a bunch of storage? containers that they made into mini quick service food restaurants (well more like food trucks i guess)  but they have live entertainment and a stage usually and it's all lit up and such! The food isn't too pricey and if you're with other preople there are a lot of options. could probably get something for 5-10 dollars and get full.

ucf,fdol4x0,t3_emdxlg,1578607347.0,"For pell grant, it is amounted by credits so if you take 3 classes that are 3 credits youll recieve 75% of the pell grant (basically each class assuming its 3 credits gets 25% which should cover the classes portion) the financial assistance grant is the same way, ucf's black and gold gets cut in half for part time though. Those are the only ones I have and are aware of.  With the things you listed though, it should make enough to cover the amount of classes you are taking. They usually update your financial aid with the grant names with part time next to it so you can know how much you get but they didn't do it early this semester for some reason."

A bit ago I was driving and looked back to make sure nobody was next to me/trying to merge and didn't see anyone and as I'm going all of a sudden a car is right next to me at the very very end of the lane to merge and went into emergency lane and cut me off really close where I had to slam on my breaks and lost control of my car which swerved a bit and somehow popped my tire with assuming something was on side of road where i swerved. but it was honestly really scary and I would of let them in if saw/they didn't try to get ahead of me, there wasn';t a single car behind me that they could of easily just gotten into."

worldnews,fdiot8s,t1_fdinpxf,1578447688.0,"All there money went to a burned building, clearly. 

with jokes aside, I agree with that statement as it is odd that people went pouring for support for a building but not a country with life, wild, and human, completely burning to ashes. But some of the people who have donated to Australia didn't donate to Notre Dame, (some probably did idk, maybe elton john too im not too sure) but I think it is kinda wrong to judge/chastise people for giving any specific amount when they are not required to or have to. I understand that they need A LOT of money to support the efforts but I dont think we should decide how other's choose to spend their money especially when they are giving it. I think it is just plain mean. Donating it seems literally makes you a target to be judged and shamed for not giving more when others havn't donated anything/even care. From what it seems, Australia's government isn't doing much to help funding wise when their whole country is burning down. Judging people for helping no matter how little it is sets a precedent that its not enough and you know, it isn't enough for the big picture, but they shouldn't be shamed for donating 1 million dollars either."
