HomeschoolRecovery,ffepl8i,t3_et6zwv,1579859076.0,"I hope you consider what I say as someone who's homeschooled since year 5- year 9 (still homeschooling). I'm not an adult, but I'd like to share some advice and experiences.

1. Please don't try to cover the whole curriculum yourself. It's not as easy as it looks, and my parents ruined my academic progress in year 5. They couldn't keep up, so I stayed half the year without finishing my English and science syllabus, and I only managed to complete maths. 
2. Another thing, don't just hire anyone to teach your daughter. If you've heard of UPwork, it's a great website for finding tutors and freelancers, but always make sure to demand their CV (by picture), and have someone who's familiar with Photoshop check it! It's pretty common with Filipino and Indian freelancers, they Photoshop their CV (of course, not trying to target anyone). I highly recommend to hire tutors from your country (I'm guessing USA). It may be a little pricey, but it's worth it if your daughter has the determination to learn.
3. She can have a social life, but it depends on you. My parents are quite strict, so I can't keep up with my friends unfortunately. If she has any interests or hobbies, you can sign her up for some clubs. Another thing, if she's fond of animals, you could have her sign up for some voluntary work at an animal shelter or farm. Do try and discuss it with her, because it'll be a great opportunity, and it'll give her time to get to know people.
4. Have her go for counselling or therapy. Honestly, I wish my parents would have taken me for therapy or counselling instead of taking me out of school and locking me up at home 24 hours a day (literally).
5. Take her out for school trips. It's much more pricey outside of school, but it's worth it.

I hope this gives you a little insight. The next step is to discuss it with her. Hopefully this goes well for the two of you :)"
