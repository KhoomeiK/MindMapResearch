dndmemes,fejk619,t1_feje0r0,1579177591.0,"""Short answer, you die pretty fast.

Long answer: your body won't be able to clean itself from all the ammonia in your blood, whoch will slowly poison you. It affects your brain, making your head spin and influencing your emotions in a pretty weird way.

But don't worry, if there is an open wound you willnjust die from blood loss in about 10 minutes, and will lose consiousness long befire that. This is perhaps the mostpmeasant way to go.

Then again, our rogue here is really skilled with a knive, though his knives aren't really... sterile. So while you won't die from blood loss, an infection of your inner organs is practically inevitable. That means, you will feel your insides burn over the course of weeks, screaming the entire time. Sure, most people say they won't scream, but trust me, you will. 

But hey, we got a fire mage with us, so we can avoid the infection by burning out the open wound, which will deliver all the pain I just described condensed into the short duration of a few hours. The upside: you won't scream. The downside: it is because you won't be able to breathe properly, because, you know, your insides are on fire. So let's better not do that. 

Where were we? Ah, yes. Your liver. Do you think you still need it?"""

cursedcomments,fejazpi,t1_fej8amh,1579164894.0,"From Wikipedia:
""Volksdeutsche (""ethnic Germans"") is a historical term which arose in the early 20th century and was used by the Nazis to describe ethnic Germans without German citizenship living outside of the Third Reich, although many had been in other areas for centuries. During World War II, Hitler forbade the use of the term because it was being used in a derogatory way against the many ethnic Germans in the SS. It is used by many historians who either deliberately or innocently are unaware of its Nazi history.""
