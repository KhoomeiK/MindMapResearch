Try dating a fashionable crowd, take one or two pics in traditionally female attire and put those on your profile. Make sure you have smiling photos on there. Tell your friends that you are looking so they can think of someone to set you up with. Join a club of something that interests you so you can meet more people naturally. It’s probably not your attire as much as you also don’t know how to flirt/ be sexual. Like I could put on your clothes and still find guys because I can make eye contact,smile, and initiate conversation."
