My brother and my dad tell me I need to do cyber security so I can be making a lot of money out of college. Every time my brother is in town he brags about how much he makes in the military, his nice car, how expensive his house payments are, etc. I don’t give a shit about money I’d rather be making an impact on someone’s life (more directly than encrypting and protecting personal information) while also being a part of making a change in how Americans view mental health. *I know my major is right because it’s what I want and not what other people want for me*. I’m also putting myself into a career where I know I’m going to have time for my family. I’d rather have less money and more time than vice verse. This major aligns with *my* values and not anyone else’s."

askpsychology,fevx49q,t1_fergdt2,1579402584.0,"Let me start by saying I'm a student so take what I say with a grain of salt.       


Say your tribe of australopithecines is defending themselves from a lion by throwing rocks until the threat is gone. But one guy runs up a tree and hides. No one likes a freeloader so the rest of the group ostracizes them so they know that next time they have to participate in defending the tribe. This individual does not recognize the need for harmony (maybe they're just not as socially adept). If being ostracized does not work then I bet collective punishment is a great motivator. The gain of ostracizing is to force harmony. Basically just saying, ""You need to behave this way for the benefit of everyone not just yourself"".       


All humans want harmony with each other because going against the grain is painful. Temperament has a lot to do with this I believe so others are just naturally predisposed to harmonize better. I don't really know why some people like denying others. I think when humans started farming and our psychology shifted to one that has the concept of private property rather than one of ""what's mine is yours and yours is mine"". I believe that some people just really don't like the feeling of inequality so they're trying to level the playing field.   

Since I'm not too versed with this concept I'll just give you a couple of articles I found on denialism.

askpsychology,fep3045,t3_eq4aaz,1579310989.0,"I believe it's because our ancestors relied on eachother very heavily for survival. Being accepted in your tribe is very important because our psychology yearns for harmony with others. 

Being ostracized is painful so were always trying to adjust ourselves so we can fit in. Which leads to a yearning for a high esteem because you know you're useful to others. 

I'm not clever enough to figure this out on my own I read it in this book called *The Social Leap* by William Von Hippel. Great read I highly recommend."
