unpopularopinion,fgc4mth,t1_fgbtb2s,1580669039.0,I don’t know how to have a good discussion because I’m too sensitive about criticism so let me rethink what I said before. Most animals these days are not treated well and are killed unethically. I like to eat meat but if there was a better way to take care of animals  then I would like that. I believe that if animals were bred hundreds of years ago by humans then they are now meant to be for the purpose they were bred (sometimes animals can be bred just because humans are there but we don’t always breed them forcefully). From what you said I understand that you believe animals that have been bred for food don’t have a choice and they shouldn’t be killed just because we made it that way. I feel like if we were better to the animals and didn’t just slaughter them all it would help in your argument as well. I kind of rambled on so tell me what you think from what you understand of this. I’m sorry for what I said earlier if it made you upset
unpopularopinion,fgc17sf,t1_fgbs6f4,1580668073.0,Yeah animals are not killed ethically and it affects us
