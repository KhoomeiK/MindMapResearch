JUSTNOMIL,fepcnxz,t1_fepbgil,1579317263.0,"All of this, you did the kindest thing possible for your sister, she was ready to go and she made her wishes known, she no doubt was grateful to you for helping her with something so momentous."
JustNoSO,fejg5hw,t1_fejdl9l,1579172651.0,"What? So next time he has a medical procedure and feels like crap she should feel free to yell and scream at him in his weakened state until he allows her mother to come in and visit? The baby isn’t going to magically disappear overnight. She carried it, birthed it and was attempting a first feed with the LO. His mother could have waited until morning. birth Isn’t a spectator spor, it is a medical event during which a woman is at her most vulnerable and literally exposed. She shouldn’t be forced to have an audience for that or for the aftermath."
fatlogic,fefupm2,t1_fefj5ay,1579065803.0,"They are creating their own niche market for people who want to limit their activity to “joyful movement”, never lose a pound working out with them! No it’s all about bragging rights for internet posts about how healthy you are!"
fatlogic,fdzr7ya,t1_fdr80xq,1578793933.0,I did not know about the jogging thing but it makes so much sense now! That is commitment!
fatlogic,fdyzjlr,t1_fdxx4u9,1578785188.0,"Yup, I have never had a diagnosis. But I was eating a bowl of steamed veggies a day and exercising for 2 hours a day (more if I “over ate” by actually having a meal with my family). But while it STARTED as me getting a gym membership and wanting to be thin in a VERY quick time it became about control. I love my family but the family home was toxic, once I moved out almost overnight my behaviours stopped... it was like night and day. even now when I am stressed or overwhelmed my appetite tanks and my desire to go for a run or hit the gym as stress relief is insane. 

My Ex left me for another woman and continued the abuse from the relationship and I lost 20kg within 3 months, people joked about the heartbreak diet but it wasn’t that at all. 

It is only NOW at 38 years old that I am FINALLY trying to learn how to balance the concept of healthy use of exercise as stress relief and the use of exercise to improve my body just because I can, same with food, I am learning how to not treat it as medicine (depressed? Have a cookie!) and to treat it as fuel."
fatlogic,fdvejmp,t1_fduqqzz,1578746627.0,Not to mention if god was a woman I would expect that the whole carrying and birthing of the baby would be an easier and less painful process....
fatlogic,fduutkq,t1_fdu455u,1578739185.0,"Because getting pregnant is one thing, actually carrying to term and the pushing the baby out is harder and more dangerous as a teenager because while you can ovulate you are not yet “ready” to have a baby. Of course it is possible but it’s riskier"

fatlogic,fdlex0k,t1_fdl4xg1,1578522549.0,"Yup, both my father and sister went through it and both had to go onto a restrictive diet for a few months then soup, then liquids only for about a week. Then back the other way. Part of the reason is so that after the surgery you don’t do yourself a damage attempting to eat too much. Even so they both went through a period of throwing up regularly because their stomachs were so small."
fatlogic,fdlemus,t1_fdl0t5s,1578522381.0,"But how much of it is WILLFULL ignorance? These shows come with nutritionists, with people who are actively trying to teach the participants CICO.  No doubt they are told in no uncertain terms that the food they are given is what they are to eat, no additions and no substitutions. Yet they still pull out the cheese and the ranch because... the addiction is more important in that moment than their long term goal. They will fully ignore the information they are given. Hell last night I will fully ignored my calorie budget and had not only a laksa but a giant cup of coke..."

AmItheAsshole,fcvjb25,t3_eizcvf,1578003300.0,NTA. The way they reacted was beyond the pale. How RUDE to just assume that you had nothing better to do and how RUDE to then try and bully you into it!

JUSTNOFAMILY,fcm4djk,t3_ehkgdm,1577763930.0,You did NOTHING. Not one thing to deserve it. I don’t care if you drew on every wall in sharpie or you smashed all of her grandmothers china deliberately or you clogged every single toilet in the house with concrete repeatedly you did not deserve that or anything close to it. I am sorry that you had that swamp monster for a mother. I am sorry that you went through that. But the best thing you can do for yourself and your future family is to go no contact. She should be dead to you after that. Again I am so so sorry.

fatlogic,fcly4dv,t1_fcljpsn,1577759317.0,I am a little later but I started this week. Nothing like starting on a Monday.
fatlogic,fcly14t,t1_fclkvt8,1577759254.0,"Sure they do, just in moderation. I lost 20kg still eating my favourite icecream several times a week. I put back on 10 because I stopped measuring and counting and started eating straight from the tub while also drinking over a litre of full sugar coke a DAY. It’s all about moderation because as much as I want to hit a size 8 (Australian about 120 pounds) I refuse if I cannot still have my icecream.... coke on the other hand is the devil and has to go, hence why I am currently fighting cravings and a wicked headache"
relationships,fcjr79d,t1_fcggvcs,1577700544.0,"I am not used to exercising, I had NEVER run before when I up and decided I was going to do a 10km race one year. Not ONCE did I puke during training. Not once. And you know what after 6 months training (and I took it slow and easy) I ran that 10km race and had a BLAST. Same with lifting weights, I didn’t know how, I had never done it. So I started off in a body pump class and went from there. That is how you slowly improve, you gradually add on difficulty. She had you attempt to almost bench press your own weight or close to if you are as skinny as you imply... that is a feat of experienced body builders!!! That is not something for a beginner. That is beyond dangerous, add to it that she WALKED AWAY!! I am RAGING on your behalf. Keep going to the gym but for the love of all things holy STOP going with your sister."
fatlogic,fcdocoz,t1_fc8qa9v,1577611905.0,I thoguht the original plan was for the character to lose weight? Like that was part of what she signed up for in the contract negotiations... but then again I don’t watch the show and only have a passing smattering of info from random rabbit holes I fell down at 3am while browsing so....
JustNoSO,fcdf6lv,t3_eh1gt5,1577609422.0,"He has a phone right? Every phone I have seen in recent history has a calendar function. Or he can download google calendar or whatever other app works for him. It’s not rocket science. He doesn’t WANT to remember, if he can remember friends stuff but not you that is pretty pointed don’t you think??"
NRelationships,fcd52ee,t3_egodbf,1577606450.0,"Yup, mine mocked me non stope for running, it was stupid, I was going to wreck my knees, it was selfish to take time away from my family. I had been begging him for years to just give it a try with me or ANYTHING. A try with me. We share kids, a few months after the split he noticed I had lost weight on the heartbreak diet. He started going on and on about how he was now running regularly with the NS. She was a runner as well as it turns out and even more fervent than me about it so he became a runner after YEARS of boo hooing it."
JUSTNOMIL,fc4amrr,t1_fc3x4mn,1577411182.0,"Perhaps the bandaids would draw more attention than just some letters? If they are older tattoos then he may have just not thought about them, same with the swastika. 

I agree the MIL in this story is crazy, but she may not be entirely wrong about these people. There is a period of time when you are starting over when letting go of past things is uncomfortable or even impossible. He may not agree with the ideologies that the tattoos represent any more but he may simply not have the funds to remove / cover them yet. He may be waiting for something (money, time, something) to do it, he may be refusing to undo the past mistakes as a way of reminding himself not to go back to the stupidity. He may think that those tattoos while they no longer represent him do represent his past that he doesn’t want to completely obliterate because to him they may be FAR more meaningful than just the surface meanings that others see.

Obviously this guy has a past. But what happened to not judging a book by its cover."
