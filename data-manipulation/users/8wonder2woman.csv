I’m taking a similar approach. Tame the areas of my life that cause me stress; do things every day that bring me joy or are just good for me. I’m also taking myself out alone. Canceled all the other dates I had the week the trampling happened though because fuuuuuuuuuuuuck it.

Those intense connections that evaporate with no warning.....it will rip your fucking heart to shreds. So hard. I want to believe it gets easier. And likewise, PM me if you want to chat bc I’m surrounded by married women and online dating is the fucking jungle.

Also - Amy Young. Check her out on YouTube. She will keep your head right while you search."

SingleParents,fevcadd,t1_fevb31q,1579395724.0,"It sounds like you have an amazing kid. I would not worry about that particular outcome. Kids are capable of a shit ton of love for all kinds of people. They can accept the adults we cannot. If Dad shows up - your kid will *always* know who took care of him during the times Dad wasn’t there. Always. You’re doing great. And sometimes the less popular parent is the safer, better parent anyway. Not that it’s a contest but really you’ve done so much for him. He knows. He does."

SingleParents,fev9a8n,t3_eqp0st,1579394659.0,"I’m not an expert. I have my own very very significant issues with my children’s not-very-present father. Here is how I handle it, which may or may not be a good way.

I tell them, “Your father loves you very much. I know he loves you because I know him very well and I can tell how much he loves you. But sometimes people have trouble showing how much they love. Sometimes, someone doesn’t know what love looks like. Your father struggles with some things about himself. Those struggles make it really hard for him to be there for you, but it has NOTHING to do with you, or how wonderful, lovable, and deserving of love you are. He has trouble with loving himself and so he has trouble loving everyone else too. Know that he is trying but he doesn’t know how to show you how much he loves you.” Something like that.

Usually we are enjoined to support the other parent’s image with the kids and encourage the children to love him/her. My personal feeling is that there are some behaviors that cannot be sugarcoated and you don’t want to shut your kid down by not acknowledging toxic or abusive behavior that your child feels compelled to bring up. And, I also believe the above. Broken people make shitty parents. It’s not because they don’t love their kids. It’s because parenting is grueling and we must confront our own weaknesses and flaws in parenting, and that’s not something everyone can hack.

For whatever it’s worth. 

Also - You are enough for your kid. Kids need one empathetic, caring, attentive adult. One. That is enough. There are some two-parent households that fail to meet that need. So know that he can be a shitbag and your child will be hurt, but he will be okay if  he has one decent parent."

relationship_advice,fee3vp8,t3_eoj4oc,1579025855.0,"Real talk OP: You’re posting here because she broke your trust and isn’t taking adequate (read: ANY) measures to restore it. 

I’ve been here. Right here. In my case it was my husband of several years, with whom I shared children, texting an ex that she was “yum”. He apologized - even became tearful- but  the kids and I were already stripped from his social media and remained so. He did not wear a wedding ring. He was resentful of my suggestions that we make attempts to strengthen our bond.

I stayed for a couple more years. I kept catching him doing essentially the same thing with different women. It got worse, not better. My self-esteem suffered horribly, and ultimately we divorced. I’m much happier now.

From experience I urge you to cut & run. We all deserve better."
AskWomen,fe4ghb6,t3_encl38,1578859089.0,"Get out of the house. I’ve moved a lotttt in my adult life; it takes six months of being anywhere to get the lay of the land socially or otherwise. Then the lights start to come on. 

Do anything - go to the gym, the library, go for a walk. Take yourself out to eat, to a movie, to a salsa party. Take a book with you and sit somewhere and read it. Go to the museum. Think about the woman you want to be someday and watch how she spends her time, then imitate her on purpose. You will transform, and find some happiness.

Also, if you want friends, seek them out. Ask the people you like out to coffee. Say yes. Compliment strangers. Be green lighting your social interactions. Smile, make eye contact, ask directions."
Parenting,fe4fva5,t3_ennbs6,1578858837.0,"LEAVE HIS ASS.

He’s a selfish, immature dick. If he wants to take his sweet time growing the fuck up, he needs to do it in a place that’s not going to torture and enrage you. Let him figure out his shit. Just not on your couch or in your bed.

You deserve better. As a divorced parent, I can tell you with confidence that it can be better on your own. You can treat yourself right and set your own boundaries with your baby. It takes time, but it’s easier when you’re not trying to reason out baffling mindfuckery in your own house. What you’re describing is really unhealthy and MOST importantly, is clearly making you miserable. For your kid’s sake you need to say no to what is unhealthy for you. You count. You matter. And your example matters. Take courage."

SingleParents,fcrepps,t3_eijtw7,1577900831.0,"You did the right thing. Don’t second-guess yourself. The relationship was abusive and there is no saving your daughter without saving yourself. She doesn’t need her toys. She needs you. You’ll gat back on your feet. There is no shame in staying with family in the meantime. Safety first, accoutrements second.

Keep telling yourself you did the right thing. Believe all these comments. We are right. You were right. You are doing great."
AskWomen,fcn4l86,t3_ehytdt,1577803104.0,"I don’t think there is one way. It’s tiny baby steps towards yourself and the you that you remember being without another human (or many) on your hip, in your arms, at your breast, tugging at your legs. For me, each thing I did for myself gradually led to other things, and I’m at a point now where I feel really excited to be in my own skin and live my own, independent life.

For context I have multiple young children and am a solo parent - dad is not in the picture.

I started going to the gym once a week and putting the kids in the childcare there. I took a dance class because I love to dance. Then it became a ritual. Then I started going to the gym more and enjoying it more. Then I started listening to my own damn music more. Then I started taking care of my own shower and sleep schedules (this goes a *long* way). Then I got on a dating app. Then I got hurt a few times and realized I gave way too many f*cks about men I barely knew and was feeling unhappy and trapped with my kids. Then I started taking myself out on dates. I bought new underwear, scheduled my last day of breastfeeding my youngest, dove into my role as business owner, spent more time outside, let myself be in a hard moment (young kids are tough; solo is tough; no way around it), and made very specific, actionable plans to invest in my own stability and pleasure.

 I have let go of the idea that my kids “need” me on any given Saturday night. They don’t. They also don’t need my world to revolve around them. We are all okay in our interdependence. Mom guilt is rough though so talk back to that ish.

It’s a winding road and one we will walk over and over, but I firmly believe that maintaining our own sense of self and worth and pleasure and our own interests is one of the greatest gifts we can give our kids and perhaps our daughters in particular. By being in the struggle for worthy selfhood, we can show them happy parents, resilient parents, full parents. And they will naturally know how to make themselves happy, resilient and full. They will also see that happiness, resilience, and fullness of life are important and they will naturally serve themselves in healthy ways. That’s the plan, anyway :)

Good luck, OP!

AskWomen,fcab4vz,t1_fca8lvv,1577565966.0,"So, I’ll offer what my favorite coach says. You don’t have to understand something to fix it. That’s not to discourage you from seeing a therapist, but in the meantime sometimes I find it helpful to imagine what a badass, take-no-prisoners type of woman would do, and I do that. That’s what I eventually hope to embody but you may find you want to be someone different. Point is, you can borrow a persona for the length of one action and just see what happens. And good for you for stopping the hookups that didn’t feel right to you. Saying no to what’s wrong for you is 90% of the battle!

And, for whatever it’s worth, here we are rooting for you."

But I have no regrets; the experience of decisive self-advocacy and advocacy for my kids transformed me into a woman who wants to live fully, be the fullest, biggest, best version of myself, set goals and meet them, explore myself, and value pleasure. And appreciate myself for the adorable, tenacious, feelsy little fairy I am.

I’m 37. I didn’t know anything about anything until I was 35 imho. The hard things make or break you; I like to lean in and really mine it for growth now."
AskWomen,fc8kyl4,t3_ego4fg,1577537080.0,"Two years out and still working on it. I landed with family for a while, started my own business, and have been working hard at it ever since.

The hardest part of it is how long the road really is. There is no overnight financial fix, particularly if you have kids or young kids. It’s a long road. Keep at it!

And also - never regretted leaving for ONE second. Ever. 100% worth all the financial hardship."
AskWomen,fc8kko4,t1_fc7acmh,1577536861.0,"I hope this doesn’t seem condescending, but felt a bit sad for you reading this. You seem to think that it’s impossible for a man to love, like and respect you *as you are*, and are chasing things you don’t want in the belief that it’s all you can have.

I would just offer that maybe that’s not true. Talk back to those toxic beliefs. Your belief that you are too ugly and fat to be loved seems patently false to me just based on this post - here are men *asking* you to hang out more, and you keep deciding that they are trying to do you a favor. Maybe they just want to hang out. Maybe what they say is sincere. Of course some people in the dating/hookup world *are* insincere, but that’s because they are primarily self-interested and lack integrity, not because of anything about the person they are talking to.

If I could offer you anything, I would say play with the belief that you are absolutely lovable and desirable just as you are. Try it on like an outfit. Wear it as an experiment. What would you do differently if you believed that? And whatever you would do differently - do that. See how it feels. You might be surprised by what’s possible in your life.

There is more out there for you. He is out there and he is looking for you, too."
SingleParents,fc7jf8o,t3_egm0s5,1577509330.0,"Do some state-based googling. In the state in which I live (not California), the primary custodial parent is the recipient of child support - or, if the custody is split equally, the lower-earning parent.

If googling doesn’t help, call a local family law attorney. They should be able to give you a basic answer within minutes."
SingleParents,fc7j63d,t3_egm8xr,1577509091.0,"Honestly, I would get used to saying no. If it doesn’t feel right, it’s just a hookup, it’s not what you want - say no. Practice saying no, because saying no to what you *don’t* want is the key to getting what you *do* want. Say no even when it hurts to say no, if you know whatever is happening isn’t right for you. Online dating is somewhat random and anonymous. Get used to the idea that you are weeding people out, and it’s mostly weeds out there. Not everyone is a good match for you. That’s okay. Say no to everything that is unkind, unchivalrous, ungentlemanly, and concerning. Give more chances to less exciting people. Say no to the people who push your boundaries. Get familiar with your boundaries (what makes you uncomfortable) and your standards (what you are looking for). Make lists of qualities you want and behavior you will not tolerate. Review those lists and stick to them.

And keep good content in your eyes and ears. I like Amy Young a lot. Her content focuses on dating as a journey of self-growth, and it’s hilarious too. When I get hurt or discouraged, I listen to her and it keeps my head right. Honestly, she’s been the best part of getting back out there after my divorce.

Good luck out there! You’re not alone."
offmychest,fc0dlk9,t3_eff5cz,1577287864.0,"Leave. Please leave. Restraining orders are available to you. Call a friend - YOUR friend, not a mutual friend. Tell him/her what happened. Get a ride out of there. You will figure the rest out but don’t let the midfuckery of your abuser fool you. You have more resources than he wants you to think you do. Act on your own behalf. Let him say what he wants. If you don’t feel safe then don’t call the police, but DO seek a restraining order. See if you can get one in Family and Probate Court instead of district court in your state. Those judges interact less with cops.

If he choked you and threw you across a room you are in GRAVE danger. Get out. Now."
SingleParents,fbxtn5o,t3_eew3iy,1577200199.0,"I hear you. It’s lonely, and not having a partner to share the small celebratory moments with can make it really feel like something is missing.

I left an abusive marriage two days before Halloween in 2017 with three kids five and under. Those holidays were rough. Just about surviving. Which we did and have.

Much of what I enjoy about the holidays are feelings of connectedness and togetherness. Soft warm rituals with comfortable people I love. I would just offer that it’s okay to feel like that is missing in your life and it’s okay to grieve the dream of sharing these days with a partner.

Parenting very young children is a difficult season of life for most adults, whether in an intact relationship or not. Going it solo is extra hard. Bring in the holidays and it’s a perfect storm of lonely sadness. It’s okay that it’s hard and feels hard. You don’t have to be happy to be doing this alone. Just take that pressure off yourself and be sad and accept it, to the extent that you can. Your feelings are natural and okay. It won’t always be this way. Hang in there. Keep going. Commit to honoring your feelings and making the best of it that you can - and yes, sometimes that means coming up with hacks that will get you through this day, this season, this year.

You are doing great. Thanks for sharing and letting others know that the season is hard for you to swing solo. We get you."

How to maintain boundaries and how to know which ones she needs to stay safe and sane. How to listen to her own feelings without letting them run her life. That her experience matters, and talking about it is okay. That conflict is normal and safe. How to express herself. Strong friendships can save her life.
