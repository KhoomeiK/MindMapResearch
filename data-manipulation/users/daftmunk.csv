depression,ffe2249,t3_et0xtj,1579834666.0,"There are different levels of consciousness. Cruel people have a low awareness of the inner worlds of others.

Only what they can directly sense is real to them, so while your tears are real to them, your thoughts and feelings are not."
depression,ffcpyer,t1_ffckl0q,1579804756.0,"Self-employment isn't the answer for everyone, but it's the golden answer for some people. I don't know if you're one of those people, but it's worth thinking about. 

It is a big fat myth that you have to pour oodles of money into a new business. Utter bologna. The image of the crazy entrepreneur trying to do the almost impossible is a stereotype. There are business models for the risk-averse, namely online freelancing.

If you have a skill you can sell without buying anything, you just have to convince the first person to buy it from you. There don't have to be startup costs at all! Now, mind you, you are more likely to succeed with a website you paid a little money for. It makes you look more legit. When you start making money, you'll also have to start worrying about taxes and business regulations. But you can just make a little money first to see how you feel about it.

All your life has been a long, confusing, sometimes embarrassing struggle to figure out what to do with yourself. If you've made it this far, you can become self-employed through a similar process of trial and error. Not that you necessarily should, but it's an idea.  

You don't even have to quit your current job to experiment. It can start out as a side project and grow over time. You could have two jobs, if that makes you feel safer and closer to retirement. 

I don't know your interests, but just in case this interests you, I got my first real client through [Acadium](https://acadium.com/get-an-apprentice/-) after doing an unpaid digital marketing apprenticeship for her. She was impressed by my work ethic. I love digital marketing and copywriting because they give me a lot of wiggle room to be creative. Getting employed is not a part of the deal on Acadium; that was just good luck for me. But it's a great place to get work experience in that field and make some connections. The apprenticeships are 10 hours a week for 3 months."
depression,ffc5wh4,t3_esiopv,1579792269.0,"Something I've learned about myself is that I'm so incompatible with society that it can seem like I'm very defective, when in reality, I do just fine in my personal element. 

No amount of socialization will ever make me love teamwork. I'm a loner and enjoy working in solitude. I also need a job that allows me to be creative. Most jobs aren't like that, so I became a freelancer. Now, things are going pretty alright.

I used to think I had to become someone I wasn't, and that made my entire life feel meaningless. I lost all my drive and didn't want to lift a finger. I have to feel like I'm making progress towards something I believe in.

You might be in a similar boat. You may not have the energy to do things because what you're expected to do will never appeal to you in a million years. Maybe you feel that society forces you to turn away from your true nature, and there's no way you'll ever be able to adapt to it.

I don't think the current mental health crisis is simply an explosion of chemical imbalances. I think that the societal system is making people feel like aliens on their own planet. They are being forced to dance to the beat of someone else's drum, and they understandably can't handle it."

depression,ff7q95m,t1_ff7hl32,1579655723.0,"Your feelings are valid, but I want to point out that your rage is noticeable. I only bring this up because rage is a poisonous emotion that eats you alive. You have a right to feel it, but you also have a right to love yourself tenderly and unconditionally. 

The opposite of love isn't hate, but indifference. When you hate people, it reveals a painful attachment to them. It's a longing for them to give you something you don't think they'll ever give you. You're still craving a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on, assistance, and/or acknowledgement that you were wronged. You may never get the apology you deserve, and unfortunately, the people who hurt you in the first place aren't likely to know or care that you're still suffering. But if you accept that it's a game you can't win, you might be able to lose your attachment and enjoy whatever inner peace you're capable of. 

On some level, you may feel like you are being perpetually invalidated by the people who won't apologize. It may give you the frightening idea that you're crazy and you deserve what's happened to you. You have an inalienable right to love yourself unconditionally, and that means believing that you deserve kindness and respect. You don't need their input to do this."
depression,ff7oxzh,t3_erwrla,1579654802.0,"There are other ways to conceptualize God, not that there's significant evidence of him/her/them in any form. Some believe that the universe, itself is one huge mega-consciousness. This doesn't mean that it answers prayers or even has goals, but it's an interesting concept to contrast against the Abrahamic God. It could also be that God created everything involuntarily, like how flowers make pollen. Maybe he's extremely powerful but has little control over his power.

depression,femmogu,t1_femm23s,1579262815.0,"I mean, it wouldn't be enforceable as a law. Mobs with pitchforks would see through to that. But having children is a horrifically immoral thing to do. 

Ask yourself why it's wrong to have sexual contact with children. Isn't it because they can't consent and will almost certainly suffer great harm? And isn't it always done to exploit the child for the adult's selfish pleasure?

There is no selfless reason to have a child. It's always made to create a false feeling of immortality, to make life less boring or meaningless, simply out of curiosity, to save a marriage, etc. 

Life is a massive, complex thing to consent to. A non-existent being has no say at all. If your children are like most people, they won't realize how severely they've been wronged. But since you're in r/depression and the world is becoming a political and climate change hellscape, they will probably wonder what the hell was wrong with you and how you could be so evil. Assisted suicide will probably still be illegal, so they will not be able leave this world peacefully if they want to."

psychology,fe4v71w,t1_fe48aeo,1578863109.0,"There are a lot of choices that are consensual on the surface, but they occurred because of lightly coercive to highly coercive conditioning. In some cultures, you can technically opt out of marriage, but not without bringing shame upon your family. In my personal experience, I was told that I could burn in Hell forever if I had sex outside of marriage. If that belief had driven me to get married, my choice would have been based on a lie someone designed to control me.

I question how happy most married people are with their marriages. Why do so many of them cheat and get divorces? As for social cohesion and collective trust, what I see happening as a result of marriage is the opposite. People prioritize their families' needs over those of everyone else. Of course, kids are probably better off with married parents, but they also pull their parents away from society to focus on them. Their parents have less time to learn about the needs of others, and voting becomes a battle of families against families.

In sex ed, I was disturbed when my lessons implied that anyone who is married is okay with having kids. Marriage was presented as a situation in which you could have as much unprotected sex as you wanted, and somehow, the resulting kids would not be a burden. That's not how it works by a long shot. 

You can talk all day about ""the family"" and how it's better for kids to have two parents each, but when you pressure people to have kids they don't want, you get child abuse and neglect (or just lifetimes of misery for the parents). The child abuse and neglect are usually accidental, as the parents don't have a natural interest in being parents and don't bother to learn what children need. Then you get a society plagued by crime, mental health epidemics, and maladaptive people in general."
psychology,fe43rdh,t1_fe3zjp6,1578855529.0,"Ravia placed love on the other side of a slash mark from sex, as though they were a part of a package. She or he was saying that force is antithetical to love/sex, but it's only antithetical to love. To be ethical, of course, sex has to be consensual. But the love narratives we use to make marriage appealing don't match up with everyone's personal natures. Some people fantasize about being swept off their feet. Other people fantasize about, well... feet."

psychology,fe3ausy,t1_fe2qfqj,1578847643.0,"As someone with submissive fantasies, I suspect that doms and subs have different, but complimentary subconscious needs. I think I like the idea of getting to have wild sex without any responsibility for the consequences; if someone is forcing himself on me, everything is his fault. When I'm being treated like an object, I don't have to worry about social appearances anymore. All my everyday anxieties melt away so I can enjoy the moment. 

I've never really associated sex with love. Marriage is an invention. A lot of people date as a socially-acceptable cover-up for their real desires. Objectification is an inherent part of sex. You give permission to be used or get permission to use someone else. There can be love in sex, but it isn't necessary for it to be enjoyable."
exchristian,fe2rodn,t3_emzxn5,1578842121.0,"The problem you're now facing is why religion was invented in the first place. We're a species that's too smart for its own good. Other animals simply exist; they don't know they're going to die, so they don't have to do things to feel like their lives count. 

The most important thing you can do is focus on the present, because the past is gone and the future isn't here yet. If you get trapped in always thinking ahead or always looking back, you will lower your quality of life. This isn't to say that you shouldn't plan for the future and prepare for it, but you need to develop the skill of shifting your mind into now-mode. Look at how happy squirrels are. See how they just play with each other and collect nuts. Their jolliness stems from living in the present. You can become like them.  

You have a powerful instinct to fear death against all reason. But realize that if there is no afterlife, then being dead is like not having been born yet. Your non-existence before your birth was not scary or painful. You didn't even want to be born! Unless there is an afterlife, you will not want to be alive when you are dead.

It isn't possible for there to be a single right way to live, as we're each too unique. Get in touch with yourself. Get to know who you are and accept what you can't change or what you shouldn't have to change. Your personal nature determines what kind of life is right for you. 

You may discover that your needs contradict everything you've been told to do, such as getting a regular 9-5 job, getting married, having kids, living in the suburbs, etc. Your nature may demand that you become a national park ranger, a monk/nun for a different religion, an artist, a traveling circus performer -- who knows! 

You will have to get comfortable with other people judging you, because they will. The feeling you will get in your heart may be the only approval you get, but it's a superior kind of approval because you know yourself better than anyone else does.

Now, unfortunately, the process of getting to know yourself is slow. The answers you need are buried in your subconscious mind and life, itself. You will need to have experiences in life and see how you respond to them. Unfortunately, you may not find yourself until much later than you expected. It's no secret that life is hard. But wouldn't it be more tragic to just conform, live someone else's life, and die without having truly lived?

The only way to enjoy something is to not take it too seriously. Because people are terrified of death, they take life too seriously. Again, look at squirrels and all their silliness. They enjoy life because they don't take it seriously. Don't fall for the myth that you have complete control over outcomes. Don't beat yourself up when you fail. Just do your best and learn from whatever happens. Don't blindly agree with people that something is bad just because they said so. You may actually like an outcome that most people see as unfortunate. They may feel sorry for you when you're having the time of your life.

Also don't think that you have to be happy all the time, because we evolved to feel happy only sometimes. Come to terms with your other feelings and accept them as companions. They have important things to tell you about who you are. Accept the parts of yourself that aren't your ego. Your subconscious will often contradict your identity, and that can make you very insecure if you let it; don't let it. Let yourself be complicated.

Learn the difference between love and approval, and be sure to love yourself no matter what. Not only will that give you inner peace, but it will give you the strength to love others."
