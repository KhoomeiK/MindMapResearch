conspiracy,ffirftm,t1_ffhyp86,1579980846.0,"Yes, we don't disagree on that. But instead of everyone hating all cops, why don't we support the good ones. Cops report bad behavior by other cops alot, you just dont see it all over the news and social media. 
I have a hard time believing that the two cops transporting her chose to risk their jobs, their freedom, their family, their whole life to commit murder to cover up something they weren't even involved in. It just doesn't add up."
conspiracy,ffir626,t1_ffhyk4a,1579980654.0,"Forensic tests take time, alot of time, it's not like on CSI where they get instant results. Not to mention, if the DPS has taken over the investigation they are super stringent on how they do investigations. They absolutely will not release anything until the investigation is complete, then they will release it all together with their conclusion.
As for the door locks, they were left unlocked. So that is a mistake.
As for slipping out of restraints, ther leg ones were loosened because she had complained about them hurting, so she could've slipped out of them. There was an empty bottle of shower gel left in the back seat, the same kind they have at the facility she had just left from, that along with being a small female wouldn't make getting out of cuffs impossible, especially front cuffed. The waste shackle is dependent on the wrist/ankle shackles so once she had thos off she could have gotten out of it.
I'm not saying this is what happened, but it is possible. I hate when people who want to hate the police because of their personal biases use anything and everything they can to justify their hate.
Be skeptical, yes, but not biased.
Furthermore, the officers transferring her were not the ones accused. Do you really think they would risk their jobs, their family, their freedom to murder an innocent victim just to cover up a co-worker's crime.
Most law enforcement officers are just normal people who want to get home to their families at the end of the day. Most are good, law abiding citizens who take pride in enforcing the law so they are against anyone breaking it.
If those other officers thought she had actually been assaulted by one of their own they would not risk everything to protect them, they'd do their job and go home to their family that night.
Yes, there are bad cops, there are bad apples in every profession. But the idea that these whole departments conspire together and risk everything to cover up someone else is ludacris. Cops turn in other cops alot more than you think, it's just not splashed all over the news and social media like it is when one does something bad."
Showerthoughts,ffipp7s,t3_etv058,1579979629.0,"Your body generates heat by breaking down food and nutrients. It also generates heat by shivering and teeth chattering when your cold, this increases muscle activity which produces heat. And when you're cold you body shifts most of your blood to muscles and organs away from your skin which minimizes heat loss through conduction and convection. 
So not only does the body have a heart producing mechanism, it also has mechanisms to prevent heat loss.

The problem isn't your co-workers or their ability to handle their family responsibilities. The problem is the work culture at you place of employment and your boss.

When a kid is sick, and can't go to daycare or school, and a parent has to stay home with them there is nothing a parent can do to change that. Not everyone has a family member or friend on call 24/7 for backup child care, and they can't just be like ""oh sorry little johnny, Mommy/Daddy has to work, best of luck!"". However, some people do take advantage of it and use their kids as an excuse, which pisses us other parents off because then when our kid is actually sick we get sneers from co-workers.
