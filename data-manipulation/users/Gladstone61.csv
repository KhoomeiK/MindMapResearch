MGTOW,fdqnw60,t1_fdqednf,1578671072.0,"As I am on a cell phone and can't easily do the cut and paste shit,  I'll say it more simply.   Nobody called you an incel or anything else.  However,  I will say that expecting sex in exchange for dinner is a stupid position to hold yourself to.   I will also say,  again,  that the person who invites someone ON A DATE, should, without question,  pay for said date,  and refusal to do so will not get you anywhere.   The idea of MGTOW is to extract yourself from this predicament to begin with,  so there isn't any question about who pays,  not that because you choose to ""Go your own way"" that anyone else is obligated to do anything YOUR way. 

Women pay for other women at dinner a lot.   Men pay for other men in the same way.  Just because YOU have never picked up a bar tab,  or bought dinner for a friend,  does not mean it doesn't happen.   It happens frequently. 

I think your attitude and vehemence on this topic implies that you simply do not think much about anybody but yourself,  and that will often lead to living a miserable life.   The idea that a woman,  or man,  would give up their evening,  get dressed, take a cab or an uber,  pay for their own dinner,  simply for the joy of your company,  is kinda sad.  And then to devalue therm by assuming that,  if you DO blow the dust of your wallet and pay,  that they suddenly owe you sex?  That's truly pathetic,  and I am not sure what color lithium pills are,  but that's probably what you need. 

MGTOW is MEN going their own way.   Not insolent children throwing a fit about paying for a date."
MGTOW,fdqk6ir,t1_fdqhz00,1578668648.0,"Man,  I have been GMOW linger than it's been a thing.  Women have ruined relationships and made them untenable,  and now it's extended to dating too.  But that doesn't mean that I am EVER going to allow women's bullshit to change who I am as a man. 

If you invite someone to take a ride inn your car,  there is a logical presumption that you aren't going to ask for gas money.   If you invite someone to go to a concert,  there is a logical presumption that you are buying the ticket.   If you are not planning this,  you say,  ""Hey,  I am going to go see Disturbed next month, if you want to go,  give me the cash and I'll get a ticket for you""

MGTOW,fdqdwsw,t1_fdqd927,1578664112.0,"Simp thinking is that you can invite someone to an event, then have them pay for the privilege of your company.   If this is your thinking, remind me not to help you move.   I'll have to buy my own beer and pizza.   If you invite people over to watch the game,  you are the host,  and should provide snacks.   You can make it BYOB, (Bring Your Own Beer for those of you who may not read English) but by God you better have some nachos and chips.   If you initiate a ""date"", then yes,  you should pay for it.   That is being a Host.  If you can't afford to do so,  then don't fucking ask.   A ""Date"" doesn't have to cost much,  and if it's the first date,  make sure she has some interest in you before you ask her, to keep from wasting money.  But once you've asked,  you are in the position of host,  and should pony up.

If this is too hard,  then maybe that explains why you have such a tough time with women.

By the way,  nice job editing the quote to for your narrative.   I specifically said,  ""If you ask a girl on a date,  of course you should pay for dinner..."".  That's a rather important part to leave out."
MGTOW,fdq67po,t1_fdq3pik,1578656646.0,"On that same note, any woman who Waits until the end of the dinner to announce that she's not interested in a relationship, is a straight-up bitch  and will not get another fucking meal.   Just because a guy acts like a gentleman and pays for a meal he invited a girl to, doesn't give her the right to manipulate that and use that to her Advantage just to get free fucking food."

If you ask a girl on a date, of course you should pay for dinner and the rest of the date, not because you are a simp, but because you are a HOST.

If you expect sex just because you paid for dinner and drinks, save your money and just go get a hooker. Nobody owes you anything, nobody has any right to expect anything.  If, as a guy, you can't accept this, just don't ask a girl out.

MGTOW,fdp9esw,t3_emk6x8,1578623084.0,"Just do your job and document the shit out of everything.   Keep a diary,  but don't be a snitch.   Never make an accusation without proof.   You can work with these broads,  but keep things professional.  Don't get involved on any personal level at all, and keep your distance.   Do all you can to avoid being anywhere alone with them,  and if you are forced to,  record any interaction within the limits of the law.  Do NOT accept responsibility for their work, but ensure anything you have to do to cover their laziness is noted by either yourself or a supervisor.  

You have to treat women in the workplace exactly as you would a male,  but you do not have to do anything to assist them outside of your normal duties.  Just know that any woman will automatically get the benefit of the doubt in any situation where it's her word against yours,  so a thorough diary including dates and times can be a lifesaver.   Just ask Brett Kavanaugh.


EDIT:  Also, if something happens where you have to be alone with a grenade co-worker,  make it as brief as possible,  and report to another co-worker or supervisor as soon as you possibly can when that encounter is over,  document the time you spoke to the other person.

We as men have been raised our whole lives to take care of women, to make them feel better, to take away the hurt in the burdens and carry them on our own shoulders.  

This is what they're waiting for. This is what they work for. This is what they manipulate us for. They want us to take their burdens to shoulder their load and in other ways take care of them and make them feel special, while they get to go out and behave is a wish doing the things that they want to do, and otherwise making our lives miserable. They pull these manipulations with Waterworks tears, an emotional hostage-taking, in order to make us feel bad for doing what we need to do to take care of ourselves.

You have to not allow this for yourself. You have to recognize what they're doing for what it is, and understand the reality that they will never change.  I learned the hard way, and had to do some extremely cold things in my life to distance myself from toxic relationships. It is not easy, it's very difficult in fired at times, but is the only thing you can do to distance yourself from this toxicity and keep your own sanity.
