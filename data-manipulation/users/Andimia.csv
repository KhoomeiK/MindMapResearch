getdisciplined,ff3i4by,t3_er1btw,1579541525.0,One thing that may help is meditation. You can use some 10 minute guided meditations on youtube to get started. Clear your mind and work at meditating daily then when your thoughts go to being negative about yourself and your work you can clear them out of your head and redirect your thoughts to the task at hand. Another option is you can write all those thoughts on a piece of paper and burn it or tear it up and then burn it and let those thoughts go. Write down three positive things about yourself and get back to work.

We built a blog of our adventure (she's a photographer so our photos were great) so I had something to show at the end. When I came back I got a job making $35k more than I made before in the same field. In two years all of the potential financial effects of taking a year off have been negated by the extra income I'm able to invest.

getdisciplined,fdnqx6z,t3_em4up8,1578591111.0,Turn your phone screen to greyscale. Less vivid colors means less dopamine and it's easier to break the addiction.
getdisciplined,fdn713k,t1_fdktkx2,1578579038.0,"There are lots of times that I want to look at my phone but shouldn't. We have to stop coasting through our impulses and control our day with a present and conscious mind. The only person who is going to keep us on task is ourselves and the one we hurt when we give in to instant gratification is ourselves. We have to take personal responsibility for making the best choices for ourselves.

Sometimes using sheer willpower to do (or not do) something is mentally exhausting. That's why it's helpful to have tools and tricks. If I HAVE to use my phone for something I can change it to greyscale. It makes the visuals less exciting and addictive. I also use an app called forest that locks your phone by planting a tree. You set how long you want the tree to grow (how long to lock your phone) and the only way to use your phone again before the time is up is to kill the tree. It makes you pause and think instead of just diving into phone use mindlessly. If you're good at leaving your phone down you can grow a little forest which is somewhat satisfying.  At night I can put my phone on the other side of my night stand to make it less convenient to pick up if I'm having trouble sleeping. I keep my book closer so it's easier to reach and I can do some light reading if I can't sleep. Reading is better for your sleep cycle than the blue light given off by a phone screen."
getdisciplined,fdkd4kj,t3_eli2vs,1578501346.0,"I am working on building a meditation habit so right now for the first month there are no times set to it, just meditate, do some, try as much as I can. Once I get the habit of getting to a quiet spot and sitting still on a regular basis then I'll start stretching the time. 

If you're using electronics do it at your desk or in a chair or sit on your floor. Your bed should be only for sleeping and sex. Then you don't have the task of getting up out of bed to put them away. Put them away before going to bed (but not in the freezer, think of the condensation when you pull them out). Then your body will subconsciously understand that when you go to bed that it's time to sleep now, not watch youtube videos. 

If you find your mind racing, keep a little notebook to jot important notes down to get them out of your head. Maybe journaling one or two nights a week to get your thoughts on paper will help. I read old sci-fi novels before bed because I don't spend a lot of time dwelling on them. I read until I get tired and I put it down. If you're still having issues try clearing your mind, focus on your breathing and meditate in the dark to relax your mind."
getdisciplined,fdka70r,t3_elishk,1578499555.0,"I try to get some things done before work because my brain is pretty fried by the time I've finished what usually turns into a 9 hour day. If I'm feeling good when I get home then I can do an hour (timed to prevent over eager burnout) of udemy. And then I can tidy up, wipe down counters or sweep (something mindless but important) before settling into a video game/hobby/stress-reducing task. You can't work all day. 

I actually have a detailed list of things I can choose from when I'm stressed depending on my mood. Things like drawing, reading, repotting houseplants, leatherwork, etc. because sometimes I forget all of the great options I have available to me when I'm that fried. Taking the dog to the dogpark with beer for me is a great one. Our dog park is a pretty social byob place and it makes my pup happy (and tired) to play fetch and follow me around while I chat with neighbors. More productive than Netflix but still rejuvenating."

getdisciplined,fdnqx6z,t3_em4up8,1578591111.0,Turn your phone screen to greyscale. Less vivid colors means less dopamine and it's easier to break the addiction.
getdisciplined,fdn713k,t1_fdktkx2,1578579038.0,"There are lots of times that I want to look at my phone but shouldn't. We have to stop coasting through our impulses and control our day with a present and conscious mind. The only person who is going to keep us on task is ourselves and the one we hurt when we give in to instant gratification is ourselves. We have to take personal responsibility for making the best choices for ourselves.

Sometimes using sheer willpower to do (or not do) something is mentally exhausting. That's why it's helpful to have tools and tricks. If I HAVE to use my phone for something I can change it to greyscale. It makes the visuals less exciting and addictive. I also use an app called forest that locks your phone by planting a tree. You set how long you want the tree to grow (how long to lock your phone) and the only way to use your phone again before the time is up is to kill the tree. It makes you pause and think instead of just diving into phone use mindlessly. If you're good at leaving your phone down you can grow a little forest which is somewhat satisfying.  At night I can put my phone on the other side of my night stand to make it less convenient to pick up if I'm having trouble sleeping. I keep my book closer so it's easier to reach and I can do some light reading if I can't sleep. Reading is better for your sleep cycle than the blue light given off by a phone screen."
getdisciplined,fdkd4kj,t3_eli2vs,1578501346.0,"I am working on building a meditation habit so right now for the first month there are no times set to it, just meditate, do some, try as much as I can. Once I get the habit of getting to a quiet spot and sitting still on a regular basis then I'll start stretching the time. 

If you're using electronics do it at your desk or in a chair or sit on your floor. Your bed should be only for sleeping and sex. Then you don't have the task of getting up out of bed to put them away. Put them away before going to bed (but not in the freezer, think of the condensation when you pull them out). Then your body will subconsciously understand that when you go to bed that it's time to sleep now, not watch youtube videos. 

If you find your mind racing, keep a little notebook to jot important notes down to get them out of your head. Maybe journaling one or two nights a week to get your thoughts on paper will help. I read old sci-fi novels before bed because I don't spend a lot of time dwelling on them. I read until I get tired and I put it down. If you're still having issues try clearing your mind, focus on your breathing and meditate in the dark to relax your mind."
getdisciplined,fdka70r,t3_elishk,1578499555.0,"I try to get some things done before work because my brain is pretty fried by the time I've finished what usually turns into a 9 hour day. If I'm feeling good when I get home then I can do an hour (timed to prevent over eager burnout) of udemy. And then I can tidy up, wipe down counters or sweep (something mindless but important) before settling into a video game/hobby/stress-reducing task. You can't work all day. 

I actually have a detailed list of things I can choose from when I'm stressed depending on my mood. Things like drawing, reading, repotting houseplants, leatherwork, etc. because sometimes I forget all of the great options I have available to me when I'm that fried. Taking the dog to the dogpark with beer for me is a great one. Our dog park is a pretty social byob place and it makes my pup happy (and tired) to play fetch and follow me around while I chat with neighbors. More productive than Netflix but still rejuvenating."

DecidingToBeBetter,fcjoxz3,t3_ehcq1z,1577697301.0,"I would start with a daily task list. Things you have to do every day to survive. Check them off one at a time as you do them. If you're successful at doing all those tasks for five days add a new daily habit you'd like to create like exercise, or meditate for 10 minutes a day. Add tasks slowly and work towards meeting all of your basic needs first. Eat healthy, have good hygiene. Even when you feel like you're paralyzed by depression just look at your list and do the next item. Maybe you can work your coping skills into your daily routine. Maybe part of your daily routine is researching and trying new coping skills. Invest a little time in yourself. 

I have found that it helps to write a little bit at the end of your day, just about what went well and what didn't. What was easy, what was hard, what made you feel better, what made you feel worse. It helps me stay mindful. Then plan out your next day. It's actually okay to write about how shitty you feel, you don't always have to look at the positive if that's preventing you from acknowledging your feelings and your pain. It's valid, get it out of you on to paper. Then when you are able to get a therapist someday you will have better words to describe what you're going through.

My depression puts me in this mindset that if I just do nothing today I'll have rested enough to do something tomorrow, but that never actually works for me because I'm just as tired and feel even more down on myself for doing nothing. I've acknowledged this fact and that motivates me to do at least one thing off my list on really bad days."
