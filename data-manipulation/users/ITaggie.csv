In 1986 the Hughes Amendment prohibited any new machine guns from entering the civilian market in the US, so any machine gun that is legally transferable to a private citizen in the US had to have been registered in civilian hands before May 1986. Due to the artificially limited supply, the cheapest legal machine gun you can find will run at minimum $6k, and that's usually a MAC 10/11. M16s and AKs that are full auto and legal for civilians run at least $20k. LMGs like the M60 run at least $70k.
