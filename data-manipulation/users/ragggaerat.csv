More specifically "" One of the biggest things I have learned working where I do is that school does VERY little for getting students ready for life at all. Yeah they can find the missing value in a fraction but they don't know anything about insurance or how to find a job, fill out a resume, file taxes, ANYTHING like that"".

In a sense its almost comicable to think people take for granted the fact that they can just say 2\*2 in their head and 4 pops up without them even thinking. That years of memorization from grades 1-5. Im sorry but you shouldnt be teaching youth if you realy beleive learning how to file taxes is more important than basic math skills. I'm going to be frank youre training your kids to be slaves. The reason why most schools in every part of the world forgoes teaching kids how to file taxes or look for jobs is because it isnt important for society. Schools are trying to carve out the best of the brightest people who can get other's to file taxes for them. We cut out teaching kids taxes and instead the pathegoreom theorem because we are tryign to get a high percentafge of them to be Einsteins not your average working joe. Most parent agree with thei sentiment if you go into any elementary school most kids want to become doctors, Engineers and Astronauts. That because their impresionable we want our kids to eb the best so we throw out the usless ""life skills"", and instead focus on the stuff that can lead them there. I;m sorry that most people in the coment sections dont know how to cook or file taxes but that not on the school. It isnt the teachers resposnibility to teach children life skills that can easily be thought to them at home. You may aswell home school your kids if you feel life skills are more important than Algebra.

This  unpopular opinion is becoming very popular especially in the developed world. This opinion that schools at their current state  arent teaching relevant topics. COmeing from a 3rd world naton I see this as completly wrong. I watched my neighbours take theor kids out of school in Ghana. Whenever I visit most of them arent doing badly on the surface levels they found regular blue collar jobs like mechanics and cooks. Theyve mastered these so called ""LIFE DEVELOPMENTAL SKIll"", like applign for jobs and filling their taxes but they cant pass a 3rd world drivers ed test. This has huge implications especailly since Uber isnt around. They are in a sense stuck in a 40 mile radius, 

Tldr

OP kids arent regular kids so they are more than likely going to miss more than a day but math skills are definetly more important than filling your taxes. Get a lwaywer for that shit."

 A 2019 [**Courant analysis found**](https://www.courant.com/sports/hc-sp-uconn-sports-football-basketball-applications-20190205-qrw4ji7ljjglndwm5ecktsmkeq-story.html) that applications to the school spike following years when the men’s and women’s basketball programs have had successful seasons. 

 The school has already paid a chunk of its $17 million AAC exit fee and will pay another lump sum this coming year, followed by smaller $1 million payments each year through 2026. After paying a $3.5 million entry fee to join the Big East, UConn’s revenue from that conference will increase gradually over the coming years. 

 Football, which suffered the biggest hit from the decline in conference revenue, was once again UConn’s most costly program in 2019, with $16.6 in reported expenses against $3.3 in revenue. Men’s basketball cost $9.9 million and generated $6 million, while women’s basketball cost $8 million and generated $4.5 million. The remaining sports together cost $25.8 million and generated $2.8 million."

Its like we didnt even watch the same show name me one perosn who would stand up for Kayleigh after both Johnny and Nelson turned on her. I mean that was pretty much vendattas team Johnny vrs team Nelson. The girls literally threw her stuff out of their room and no female stood up for her.  Thats goes beyond bullying. They went as far as moving when she came to sit with them at the bar yelling no one likes you. Kayleigh left becuase she was being bullied by both sides of the house.

geopolitics,fctpl4u,t1_fctiox3,1577953016.0,"What controversy? youre comparing a protest in a city to that of an entire country.  Hong Kong has 7 million people India has over a billion. Obviously there would be more deaths in their nation wide protest. Even the swetest of demonstrations sometimes have deaths. Additionally, you cant compare Hong Kong protest with the Indian one. Two toally dieffering issues requireing totally different responses. By comparing them you completely ignore the hsitry and complexities behind a communist regime that has existed for 100 years to a 1000 year old conflict that has manifested into this bill.

 Existence of Pakistan came about out of that one day India will become a majoritarian state, ruled by religious nationalists like Modi today. The existing guarantees in Indian constitution weren't deemed enough to stop a Nazi-inspired group to take over and hence, eventually a seperation.  

Nazi inspired take over is harsh especially when you compare the way both India and Pakistans elect their heads of state.  THe Indain people could very well vote out Modhi if the alternative minorty party was a better option. The people of Pakistan cannot to the same extent.

I would like to beleive that many redditrs have google at their disposale. It soesnt take that long to figure out who are the good and bad guys when it comes to a bill created to protect PERSECUTED MINORITIES.
