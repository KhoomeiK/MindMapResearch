science,fdt79gq,t1_fdptwru,1578712846.0,"Chicken breasts are super expensive. Much cheaper to buy a whole chicken. Over a week's worth of meals can be taken out of it. Just combine it with veggies and rice or pasta.

For me, I can do that for four people for around 10 dollars a week. Veggies only would cost more, mainly because we'd have to eat more veggies than meat to get the same calories. My mom and grandma don't need the extra boost, but me and my husband do. We're on our feet all day almost every day and he does labor intensive work.

Fresh veggies are expensive, canned is cheapest. Canned is also full of salt, so they must be rinsed. Frozen can be cheap, depending on what you get.  

I will wring every bit of use out of a whole chicken I can. Broth gets made from bones and either used for people or pet treats. Meat scraps also get turned to pet treats. That's a huge plus for meat, being able to feed my animals while also feeding me. (I have lots of cats lol.)

Overall, it depends on what kind and what cut of meat you get, as far as price goes. Skirt steak is cheaper than tbone, whole chickens are about the cheapest meat in general."

I looked it up and once I figured out the nit picky stuff (like always whisk and don't dump the flour in and turn the heat down), it's a breeze. I don't follow the bechemel recipe exactly. After you get the idea down, improvising is fun.

Keep trying! Home made mac is sooooo much better than the boxed shit. And it's customizable. I sometimes toss in some mozzarella for a sticky stringy cheese that I think goes good with biscuits.

I'm a fatty and love my cheese. I often make biscuits when I make mac and set aside a spoonful of cheese sauce to dip them in lol. (I can't make scratch biscuits, I use the premixed box stuff.)

I find a lot in my favorite thrift store. I live in a mill town and sometimes a worker will donate these massive things of good quality thread, enough to last freaking forever. I pay maybe 2 bucks at the most for them.

For fabric you can buy brand new, but it's expensive. I stick with thrift stores. Curtains, sheets, clothes, anything fabric is fair game. You can also ask people to save their fabric items they don't want for you. Pillows are good cuz you can get cute fabric and stuffing!

I like to make bags and blankets. For quilts I'll use an ugly sheet as the base and sew my pretty stuff on top. Add a pretty sheet as your backing, sew on a binding and boom, hand made blanket. I like making stuffed dolls and accessories for them.

It's also a handy for fixing clothes, pillows, anything sewable really. Saves you from buying new and if you practice, you can tailor your own clothes.

AskReddit,fdkto5p,t1_fdkr399,1578510928.0,"Uh it's not really specific but I can give you an ingredient list. I tend to eyeball the stuff instead of measuring. 

Mac pasta, or shells. Shells make me feel fancy. Salt your pasta water!
Whole milk, unsalted butter. 
Cheese. Shredded is easiest to work with, so if you have blocks, shred them. I typically use cheddars or colby Jack as a base, and throw in parmesan, or some other highly flavored cheese to vary the taste. A hunk of cream cheese added to it makes it super creamy. 
Sour cream gives it a tang if you like that.
Pepper, garlic, rosemary, whatever kind of herbs you want. I like the Italian blend or chicken seasoning mix. 
Plain ap flour to thicken.
Fancy add ons like bacon or chopped veggies go in when it's done. I like bacon bits, a friend likes tomatoes or tuna. 
Some folks like mustard or tumeric powder for a little zing and for the lively color. I personally don't cu it tastes funky to me.
If you have a ham bone, drop it in the water while ur cooking the pasta. Gives it a mild meaty flavor. 

Cook pasta and set aside. 

Put the milk and butter in the pot over medium heat. Don't wanna scorch the milk cuz that stinks like hell. Keep stirring with a whisk. A fork or big spoon works, I find the whisk easier, keeps all the stuff blended better. 

When butter is melted, start adding your cheeses. Cream cheese is hard to cut up, but do it as best as you can. Put it first because it takes longer to melt. I add cheese bit by bit to make sure it blends in and the sauce doesn't break down. Chuck the sour cream in last, if you're using in.

Prepare for an arm work out. Whisk that shit like it ate your pet turtle you had as a kid. I know you're tired but keep going. 

When it's all blended and looking smooth, toss in your spices and *sprinkle* in a bit of flour. Don't go putting blobs in there, they won't blend nicely. 

I add a bit of flour at a time until it looks thick enough to me. I then cook it a little bit more to make sure the flour don't taste raw and gross. 

 If you put too much flour you wind up with cheese dough. Might be a good thing, but not if you want mac and cheese.

When that's all done, take it off the heat and stir in your bacon bits or what have you, then the shells. 

Leftovers can be smooshed into a greasy muffin tin and topped with more cheese and/or bread crumbs and baked. 

Hope this mess makes sense to you! I'm not much of a cook, and when I do venture to cook, I tend to wing it. I'll look up a recipe then throw it out and do what I want. Occasionally it ends well for me lol."

Can't really carry a big stick into public, most people frown upon it. I'm gonna start carrying my box cutter with me again. At the very least I'll have a chance if someone grabs me.

I just hope he wasn't terribly offended, and I hope he continues to hollar at anyone who he thinks needs a heads up. 

Shit like the creeper happens all the time to women every where. God forbid we stand up for ourselves cuz we're just a mess of over reacting hormones...

I dunno why this spooked me so bad. It's happened before, but not in a long time. I think I got comfortable being the dumpy woman no one pays attention to. 

Thanks for the reply. Don't be shy about talking about this shit. It takes all of us to fix it, for everyone."
gatesopencomeonin,fde4muw,t3_ejyyd8,1578331077.0,"People give me shit because my fave ST is Voyager. Yeah it has its problems (like any series)but I don't care. Most male ST fans I've talked to can only talke about Seven's outfits instead of the actual plots, so to hell with them. I want an actual discussion about a plot, not listen to you lewdly demean a character and actor. 

Love Trek how you want. I don't like every version of it, and I'm not a full blown nerd about it with the trivia and memorabilia. I do what I want and that's all that matters. 

Also there's some amazing ST fanfic out there if you ever get nostalgic lol. I've been a fanfic fiend since I was 10. Embrace the love!"

technicallythetruth,fdaz1xb,t1_fdap8ys,1578251996.0,I vote under my maiden name cuz I barely exist any where under my maiden name...the DMV can suck my ass.
technicallythetruth,fdayt69,t1_fdaebr7,1578251917.0,"It's easy to do the form, but my god it's a pain in the ass to deal with the aftermath.

We can't file taxes unless I use my maiden name. My married name is not recognized. I can't do any kind of work online because my name isn't recognized (aka I don't exist), school was a hassle, anything that requires verification of who I am is a pain. 

So technically I'm two different people according to the government and have to make sure of what name is on what. 

I don't know why. All I did was add his last name. I have 4 names and they're on my SS card (that was a pain to work out). Fuck sakes, can't anyone keep decent records?"

The good news is you'll most likely grow out of the funk. Hang in there. One day you'll be that cranky old person complaining about kids these days."

unpopularopinion,fclgqlg,t1_fckie70,1577747402.0,"I have touch and boundary problems thanks to my family. I was constantly pushed and forced to hug and kiss people when I didn't want to. 

I still get bitched at by my mom for not hugging and kissing her. I can't stand being touched, or have my hair played with, all that. I mean I like it, but under very specific circumstances that can and do change in a split second. 

I don't think pecks on the lips are odd, I still do it occasionally with my mom and grandma. The problem for me is being pushed/nagged/forced into it. If a kid wants to give me a kiss on the lips, cool. Cheek, cool. No kiss? Cool. As long as the kid has a choice, it's no big deal. 

Fist bumps are a way better option than kisses and hugs any way."
unpopularopinion,fclg3dq,t1_fckwxww,1577746977.0,"From what I've noticed (and done myself), the older the kid gets, the fewer lip kisses you get. Kids age out of it or decide their own boundaries, stuff like that.

I wouldn't worry about it. Enjoy the sloppy baby kisses while you got them. I'm not very physically affectionate, but even I adore baby kisses. They're so cute and eager lol."
