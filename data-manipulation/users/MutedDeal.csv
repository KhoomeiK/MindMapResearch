I hate when people like like that recounting an event, but he was having a temper tantrum, so probably didn't even remember what he was saying.

todayilearned,ffbcu51,t1_ff2j716,1579759986.0,"It was really really interesting because the nastiness and homophobia was just pouring out of people, but apparently human nature is better that it seemed at the time-- I think as the disease went on and more human interest stories came out about HUGE numbers of people so young dying such horrible deaths- I remember they called the obituaries in San Francisco ""the gay man's sports pages""- affected more people to develop not only sympathy, but also it REALLY helped in what they say was the most important part of sexual civil rights- that as everything became more public- and AIDS sure made it public- people realized just how many members of society are (quietly) gay, bi, or otherwise.  (It certainly had that impact on me and my parents, who were very liberal but naïve before.)   
I am so sorry for your uncle and so happy for you!  I teach high school and have so many gay or bi or questioning students, and they are so... just not seen as weird or having to stay in the closet.  I mean, we have a crossdressing gay male teacher who started this year, and nobody batted an eye-- in fact, the gay or questioning kids adore him and he's sort of a mentor, esp. because he's doing his own thing- old school transvestite gay, no desire to go full transgender, but wears high heels and a purse.   I mean, I remember when I was in high school (AIDS time- late 80s) in ""liberal"" California, there were debates in the state legislature about making it illegal for a gay person to be a teacher.    It was so gross and hateful and stupid."

Arthur Ashe and Ryan White and Elizabeth Glaser (sp?  the Starskey and Hutch wife) were true heroes, but also got it through blood transfusions and that was always clear.  

The whole thing was a sick religious battle, and that's why Reagan didn't even acknowledge it was happening for years- which is terrifying.  Entire communities were being decimated and this disease was a death sentence and those few years when we didn't know what the hell it was or how to treat it-- it was terrifying.  

I envy those who missed that period- it was awful and sad and scary.  I had just started college when Magic Johnson announced he had it and I remember going from ""oh, the poor gays and drug users and transfusion patients"" to ""oh my god, we are vulnerable.""   Never in a million years did I think Magic would still be alive and fine 30 years later.

I also was so horrified at the homophobia it stoked, but frankly, in the few decades since then, so much acceptance of different sexual orientations has shocked and impressed me.   I always thought it was an esp. evil and tragic disease because it was hitting populations that already suffer discrimination and stigma.   I feel like maybe people agreed with me and started having more empathy that these groups were hit with such an awful plague.  Gives me some faith in humanity."

I had a law degree but never passed the Bar so had been sporadically working as paralegal and HATED IT- one reason I couldn't pass the Bar is because I hate and am TERRRIBLE at law.

Anyway, became an extra on Lost soon before I was divorced; the other extras were all telling me how easy it is to become a substitute teacher- get certified quickly, pays pretty good, great part time job.   So after the divorce, I did it- then within a year starting a nighttime mostly online program to get my teaching degree.   Became a teacher 4 years ago (age 44) and absolutely love it.   

Keep in mind, after my miscarriages and divorce I was in this REALLY dark place about kids and resentment over people who had kids.  I could barely enjoy my first nephew the first year of his life, because I'd just lost another late term pregnancy.    Anyway, I actually dated a guy soon after the divorce and he sat me down and said ""you are going to be so miserable and make yourself insane with this attitude.  You like kids, make yourself smile at every baby you see; just try it.""    So I did and I got better and my first sub assignment was a pre-k class, and I was up all night terrified it would make me depressed and trigger my grief, and it didn't.   

I'm at the happiest and most stable of my life, and feel like a professional success (I'm actually good at this!) and look forward to going to work for the first time in my life.

Live Aid it went up and down several times, and was biggest when he was really excited- like when he stands up to sing Radio Ga Ga or when he's doing the singalong with the crowd.

I had a marriage that crashed and burned (no kids) after 8 years, and if my sister's husband made fun of that as a failure, I'd be really hurt and embarrassed.  And my divorce was super hard on my parents because it was a big upset and crisis in my life.

My mom cried about my divorce too, even years later, because it was such a painful time for me and the way he treated me made her so upset.   Why are you hurting these people?  Ugly divorces are not funny or okay to poke fun at, especially because you are mad about some damn portraits.   

How's this?  My parents' huge mantel now consists of a HUGE ornate gorgeous picture of my sister's wedding photo, and a 5X7 of me from HIGH SCHOOL.  (I'm 48, but this was only formal pic of me we could find.)   They took down (with my consent) my wedding photo after the divorce but now the house loooks like it's got one successful glam daughter, and maybe a teenage cousin or friend of the family.   It SUCKS but I can't be mad at anyone.  And yeah yeah we didn't have a weird family portrait rule (we never did family portraits) but my point is life isn't fair.  I don't feel good when I look at our version of ""family portraits"" but I don't let my blood boil.

You sound happy and happily married.  Focus on that.  Ugly divorces are a nightmare.  When your grudge bubbles up, replace it with empathy or even pity.  Grudges with in-laws are exhausting, destructive, and just... what do you expect to accomplish?   You kind of win already, and you have already proven their rule was dumb and now they have to hide the pics.  Let it goooooo."
UnresolvedMysteries,fept94y,t3_eqa5em,1579330494.0,"The one that really got me is Yosemite/Carey Stayner.  I was in the area when the mom and 2 girls disappeared from motel in Yosemite, then were found- mom and visiting friend in trunk of burned out car; then mom's daughter found dumped with throat slit.

The FBI got involved and quickly assured us that mom's wallet had been found hours south, and that a local drug gang had done it; they arrested a few of them and assured public it was being solved.

A few months later, Cary Stayner broke into home of Yosemite resident and tour guide Joie Armstrong, threw her in his truck; she fought him like hell, even down to the minute he decapitated her.

My boss came to work the day after that news broke and was shaken- her own daughter, age 8, had taken a field trip to Yosemite recently and Joie was their guide.  Their teacher had to tell the 3rd grade class what happened before they heard it on the news.

The WORST part (besides realizing the FBI was full of shit and this guy was hiding in plain site AND the maintenance guy at the motel AND the brother of famous abducted child abuse victim Steven Stayner) was when I came across a paperback book about it in the bookstore.

I made the mistake of reading his confession and the details of what he did to all four of these women.  In detail.   All of it was so sick, and he knew it was-- I can't go into detail because it's too disturbing to inflict on anyone else.  But I wish I'd never read it.   I love and get emotional about true crime, but this is one that left me really ill and just depressed.

The other one that I wish I never heard of was Sylvia Likens.

Edit to add the hi-fi murders, with the victims being forced to drink Drano.   And the long-term affects on the survivors.

Then my sister gave me a pile of true crime books and one was this case.  I read it, cringing, and it was awful, but not nearly as awful (or beautifully, tragically written) as the one from the newspaper.    The newspaper piece focused so much on their life before the trip as simple farmers whose road trip to Disney World was like a lifelong dream.   It also focused on the aftermath and how the husband/father dealt with his loss as well as the boyfriend of one of the girls.

AskReddit,fd8343d,t3_ek7maj,1578213414.0,"Taking Steve Guttenberg's overly-enthusiastic life advice seriously.

I was newly dating this guy, long-distance.  During this period (late 90s), I went out with a friend in L.A. and we ended up seated next to Steve Guttenberg at some cheap LA wannabe hotspot.  He was falling all over her (she's gorgeous; I'm average at best) and she made it clear to both of us that she wasn't interested, but he continued to chat me up very enthusiastically (pretty sure in retrospect he was high) and I mentioned my new boyfriend and he told me he had a magically inspired ""sense"" that this boyfriend and I were fated to be together.  He went on and on re: I had an aura of fate about me and he could feel vibes about this relationship and I had to move to the other side of the country like NOW and MAKE THIS HAPPEN.  Like he went on for an hour.  This is before I'd tried cocaine, so I thought it was just sincere enthusiasm and magical cosmic insight by STEVE GUTTENBERG.  How could he be wrong?

I soon after moved across the country to be with the boyfriend, not just (or even largely) due to Steve, but Steve got me even more ga-ga over the idea, which in retrospect was stupid and rushed and just not the kind of thing you seek advice about or even discuss with Steve Guttenberg.

The remote boyfriend and I are now bitterly divorced.

I know this sounds like a shitpost, but how likely that I would make it up?  I also haven't thought about it literally in years AT ALL but it came to me reading this thread, and thus will likely keep me up tonight.   Fuck you Steve, though you probably meant well.

AmItheAsshole,fcjjfqu,t1_fcggpn3,1577689973.0,"that seriously made my day!  I feel similar relief/joy when I read about abolitionists and suffragettes back in the day (before they won their battles.)  

We weren't the first generation to notice things sucked!   And wow, I hate Breakfast at Tiffany's for that character- I assumed nobody in 1961 was woke lol."
tifu,fch4lgy,t3_eh5uu6,1577647261.0,"I'll be honest, this is one of the worst titles/stories I've ever read.   

But it's over, no harm done, the witnesses were cool (even entertained) and you sound so guilty which makes you a good conscientious mom, so stop feeling so guilty!

No need for anyone to go beating themselves up about it.

(I do disagree about sharing the story with her in 50 years.  I wouldn't want to know.)"
queen,fch1y4m,t3_eh8idx,1577646493.0,"The cutie is Freddie.  The pretty girl is Tiffany.  She was the one gifted by Mary and his only thoroughbred cat.    

As a Hawaiian fan, I love these pics too for Freddie's aloha shirt.  (same as in Somebody to Love video.)

He loved his cats.  As if he couldn't be even more perfect!"
thebachelor,fcd3mzz,t3_egu2sf,1577605943.0,"Ah, he's a dreamboat.   Dimples alone are swoon-worthy.  You are adorable.  Happy birthday and congratulations!  I am jealous.

Not my ultimate fantasy but would happily take a kiss on the top of the head.

You are what- 2 degrees from kissing GiGi Hadid?  One degree?   Not sure if it's a plus for you, but I think it's an not-boring way to wrap up a decade.."
AskReddit,fcczhh7,t1_fcc6f3q,1577604505.0,"Scrolled down to find this.

I liked ""this \*fucking\* sucks.""  And ""this is one of the worst things that will ever happen to you"" when I feel like I'm losing it.

I'm so sorry about your dad.  My mom went 4  and a half years ago.  It fucking sucks!  xoxo"
AskWomenOver30,fc93tmp,t3_egnqx3,1577546580.0,"A couple beat me to it, but wow I feel your pain!  I was so frustrated until discovered Nordstrom's.

Nordstrom Rack replaced my entire wardrobe- sales rack dresses and separates average maybe 30-40 for a GREAT machine washable dress.  Real Nordstrom if I'm treating myself and a dress or top about $50-60, shoes same range on clearance sales rack, and quality and cuteness (and age appropriateness) is worth it.  

And one more vote for Kohl's.  I just don't have one where I live, but hit it whenever I'm visiting family."
