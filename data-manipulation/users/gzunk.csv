In my old threadripper system I had **seven** NVMe drives - 3 on the motherboard and 4 in a Hyper M.2 x16. All directly connected to the CPU.

buildapc,fdrw60l,t3_emx089,1578690677.0,"CSM = Compatibility Support Module.

Your firmware (what people call BIOS) can boot in one of two modes - UEFI or Legacy. If you have the CSM turned on then you can still boot in UEFI mode, but you can also boot in Legacy mode. If you have the CSM turned off, then you can only boot in UEFI mode.

Booting in UEFI mode requires a GPT partitioned disk and an EFI boot partition. Booting in legacy mode requires an MBR partitioned disk with an populated MBR (Master Boot Record - the first sector on the disk). In UEFI booting, the first sector on the disk runs the UEFI bootloader that then loads the actual boot system from the EFI system partition, meaning it can have far more functionality.

Once you have installed Windows, it's tricky to switch between Legacy and UEFI booting, and honestly, it's not worth it. UEFI booting only really gets you things like fast boot.

In order to install Windows in UEFI mode, you must ensure that whatever disk you're trying to install Windows on is either partitioned using the GPT scheme, or is not partitoned at all - Windows will partition it as GPT for you. When you're booting you then have to choose the USB Stick (or DVD-ROM) that has **UEFI** at the end. That's all there is to it. No need to disable the CSM at all.

Hope that helps."

buildapc,fdrld6t,t1_fdrkex4,1578686217.0,"It's complicated...

A hard disk is split into partitions, and each partition is formatted - not the entire disk. So you have an EFI partition and a system partition on the HDD, it's this system partition that you would see from Windows, not the EFI partition.

If you were to format the system partition on the HDD, then it would still be bootable - since you haven't touched the EFI partition. If you were to clean all the partitions off the HDD then it would no longer be bootable, as you would no longer have an EFI partition.

There is no easy way to fix the SSD to work independently. It involves resizing existing partitions, creating an EFI system partition and then populating it with the correct boot files. If I've ever found myself in this scenario then I just re-install Windows with only the disk that I want bootable plugged in, rather than mess around creating and resizing partitions, and I consider myself a very experience builder (20+ years experience)."
