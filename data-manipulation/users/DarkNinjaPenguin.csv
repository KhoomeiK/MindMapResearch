3. ""If you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill us too"", and the scene with Harry talking about going after Sirius - that didn't happen in the book, but if it had Ron wouldn't be standing around in the background doing nothing.

6. ""We're with you whatever happens""

7. ""I'll go with you"" - again this didn't happen in the books (it's unbelievably silly even in the film) but again Ron wouldn't just stand there saying nothing when his best friend just told them he has to die.

It's really interesting to think about what may or may not have been, had Titanic not sunk though. For example, Jacob Astor who perished in the disaster owned a very famous hotel in New York, the Waldorf-Astoria. After his death, the family sold the hotel to developers and a tower block was built in its place. You might have heard of it - it was the Empire State Building. Had he survived, that building would not exist - at least not where it stands today.

In terms of maritime law, Titanic was the catalyst that got serious safety regulations enacted across the world. If Titanic had not foundered, another ship would have to go down with (probably even worse) loss of life before these laws would be brought into effect."
