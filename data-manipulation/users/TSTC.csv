wow,fgto18u,t1_fgtjyc4,1581107132.0,"I wouldn't agree with that. Don't get me wrong, I understand exactly what you are saying. RNG mechanics are psychologically addictive, but I think plenty of people understand that being addicted to spending time in something doesn't mean it's a good game. It \*does\* mean it is profitable for shareholders but that comes with a catch - the playerbase can't be aware that it is trapped in the RNG addiction.

So pure RNG fiesta is going to be short-term bad for game design (because it isn't fun and games being fun is game design 101) and long-term bad for shareholders because more and more people will decry the system and show how it is exploitative and addictive.

IMO, food really degrades if it is cooked or plated too long and I spend a lot of effort into making the dish as good as possible.

I do my part. I always tell my wife (and anyone else I am cooking for) that I'm starting dinner and it should take around X minutes. Then I'll usually do an announcement like ""Dinner will be ready in 5 minutes"".

I'm the better cook, by far. I've always enjoyed cooking and she did it merely out of necessity before we met. So pretty early on, way before we were even engaged, I was the primary cook.

Even though I enjoy it, it's a lot of work. Sometimes I feel like she doesn't really understand that the process of prepping everything and then cooking is usually going to take an hour or more.

As for doing the dishes, we've tried to split things up fairly and that's how it shook out. I don't really like it but at the same time, it's just how it has to be for reasons I'm not wholly going to get into. My solution is to try to always make sure the dishwasher is empty so that I can be doing as much of my kitchen clean-up while cooking.

But ultimately, it's just not worth making an issue for us. Sometimes I find it really taxing but I'm not going to ask her do to my responsibilities unless I really need the help."

I think all of the melee dps are pretty fun. The biggest difference between them is pretty much just complexity of rotation/mechanics. Some classes have more positional moves so you'll need to be constantly moving to avoid damage in addition to moving to the correct position relative to the mob to get off your combos. Samurai was probably the most straight forward.

Archer (which goes into Bard) is pretty new player friendly too.

Black mage is new player friendly but honestly was one of the most frustrating classes in boss fights at end game because they are so rooted in one spot. If you are moving, you only do like 1/5 of your normal DPS. But for leveling you just kinda blow shit up with no regard for that.

Tanks are fun and the only thing keeping me from tanking is that I don't ever feel like I ""know"" the dungeon well enough. For a new player, you won't be able to access Dark Knight or Gunbreaker until you get a class up to the required level for each (50 for DRK and 70 for GNB if I remember correctly).

They sometimes want a level 1 campaign (although more likely we start at 3) because it lets them build the character from the ground up. There's still plenty of danger as a level 1 party but now your life and death is more determined by what you do than whether or not you get targeted and I roll a nat 20. Especially for wizards/sorcs or other characters that tend to be fairly flimsy at level 1, this is a huge boon. You can still die in a round or two if you put yourself in a bad spot but you aren't going to unexpectedly take your full hit point total in one attack just because of a crit.

To my players, there's absolutely nothing fun about that possibility. And as a DM, there's nothing fun about trying to balance around the idea that I might accidentally TPK because I rolled two 20s in an encounter."
assholedesign,fgmcb0u,t1_fgm9q1u,1580921845.0,"I didn't even address the example given because it's so far off from correct usage anyway. You use punctuation for direct quotes. That wasn't a direct quote, so of course it looks wrong to use it that way. If you are using quotes for emphasis, titles, or other things besides direct quotes, you don't use punctuation.

Example: He said he just ""loved"" spending time with his in-laws.

Even though the ""he"" in this case did actually say that, we aren't using quotes to give up a direct quote. We are using them to show that this person doesn't love spending time with his in-laws and was instead being facetious.

Your example is not considered correct because you still haven't solved the issue of needing punctuation within the direct quote. John said a full sentence and the full sentence needs to be punctuated appropriately. Putting the comma outside has the same problem as putting the period outside. You've created a clause that makes it less clear what is going on.

Both the comma and the period are doing the same thing, which is to tell the reader that that was the end of the sentence that John said. But we use the comma because reading two periods in one sentence gets more confusion, such as: 

""The weather outside is nice."" said John.

Give tax incentives to companies willing to take on extra risk by hiring ex-felons so that they have actual job opportunities to use those skills and educational experiences.

There should also be room to potentially set up criteria for whether or not all persons are capable of rehabilitation but then we're talking about a separate system just for life without parole.

There are plenty of countries with this model of restorative justice and those models have lower rates of recidivism, which is the rate at which people commit crime after being released from prison.

It's still punishment. You're taken out of society and away from most of your choices. But the aim of the punishment is to correct behavior, not inflict pain as retribution (which is basically what the US penal code does). Retaliation just keeps the cycle feeding itself and in the end, we all lose with a system like that.

My point, which I guess stands alone now, is that if businesses managed to find profitable operating points at the equivalent of \~$22 per hour as minimum wage, businesses today would also find profitable operating points when wages increased. Some of that would come from increasing price but considering most businesses don't sell truly indispensable goods or services, nearly all businesses would also see a base increase in revenue due to the sheer fact that when people have more money, they spend more money. 

Also, I feel like arguing about staying within a strict capitalistic model in a sub about how capitalism is flawed is a little weird. All those other issues you brought up don't need to be solved by trying to make our local wages compete with international labor. They should be solved by the government creating a healthy, growing economy here and protecting it through limits on international trade and limits on carbon emissions related to trade. If all labor from China was subject to additional taxation to bring it in line with the cost of labor in the US, US companies wouldn't see any reason to outsource. Then those wages stay within the country and feed back into the national and local economy. The race to the bottom is always a shortsighted model.

LateStageCapitalism,fg43a53,t1_fg3zpdm,1580495253.0,"Flawed argument to begin with. As a business, you depend on customers spending money so that you can collect your profit off the goods or services you provide. This is how you make your wages.

If people don't have money to spend, you sell fewer units of whatever you're selling, which translates directly to less money to put into your business or into your own pocket.

Inflation is going to keep happening, so if you keep your wages stagnate (and other businesses are as well), the buying power of society continues to decline until you are going to be unable to operate anyway, unless you happen to provide something so essential that people cannot choose to not purchase it.

Force increase to wages also means more money, overall, in the economy. So you'd find the new price point to maximize your revenue and use that revenue to continue operating within a model that is growing instead of shrinking. Businesses have to stop thinking about operating quarter to quarter and realize they are basically the quartet playing on the Titanic while it sinks.

Vanilla memories for me include having extensive trials to try to get into the prestigious raiding guilds, grinding AV rep for a long ass time because we didn't have 1.12 AV, and mindlessly slaughtering Scarlet Crusade for gold/cloth drops for my mount. Honestly the end game of Vanilla wasn't too far off from the end game I experienced this time in Classic, except I didn't have the time for it now."
MonsterHunterWorld,ffc43ks,t3_escxjl,1579791048.0,"GS is absolutely nuts even at higher difficulty monsters - assuming you can still land the combo. The True Charge Slash (TCS), which is the final charge up slash you can do where you do one small hit and then cartwheel into a large hit, does insane damage now provided that you hit with that small hit first. But you can't start out doing a TCS, you have to do other strikes to lead into it and GS strikes are slow. In the base game, one way of cheating this was to start a strike, shoulder tackle which takes you to level 2, start that and shoulder tackle and now you're at TCS. Now you can do a strike and then do a slinger shot burst (if you have ammo) and go straight into TCS. Little faster than the old shoulder tackle chain but still, in Master Rank the monsters are going to be enraged most of the time and moving most of the time. 

So endgame, GS users definitely have to work harder than some for their big damage but it comes with the reward of even bigger damage potential than most weapons. If there's a good GS user in the party, you'll usually have some of the fastest clear times. But if the GS user is still learning monster patterns and can't land those TCS, you'll find their total damage is lower than more consistent weapons and that slows down the pace for everyone."

It's a big deal to me that people stop doing the exact thing you did, which is come into any given situation and just say ""lol sounds like bipolar"" when there is nothing to suggest that the experiences relayed actually meet the DSM-V criteria for bipolar type I or II. I've spent the past decade of my life dealing with my bipolar type I with rapid cycling diagnosis and trying to not let it ruin my relationships or stop me from having the kind of life that I want. So I don't enjoy seeing it thrown around trivially, much like I am sure people with life-impacting OCD don't enjoy people relating being anal retentive or neat as ""being OCD"".

Nothing about this story indicates this person suffers from periods of depression or cycling between depression, euthymia, and mania.

IAmA,fen7499,t1_femoxxk,1579278428.0,"The short answer - because it's the law. Universities are bound by two relevant federal statutes when it comes to sexual crimes - the Clery Act and Title IX.

Under Title IX, Universities are required to investigate a range of acts that can be summed up as sexual violence/crimes/harassment. The Clery Act requires Universities to publish those statistics (as well as statistics for other crimes, like robberies, assaults, etc).

As far as why those federal laws are in place? The general idea behind the Clery Act is that prospective students (or parents) have the right to assess how ""safe"" a campus is, and the number of incidents on a campus each year is part of that information. The idea behind Title IX is to create a system where employees (at least of a certain classification) are mandatory reporters of incidents and a Title IX office conducts an independent review of allegations to avoid things like University politics sweeping incidents under the rug.

Neither of these are separate from police jurisdiction or the justice system, except in the cases where a University has fully certified police department with jurisdiction over it's campus (but still, the idea is that those PD's operate outside of the typical University political structure)."

ABoringDystopia,fejvlqk,t1_fej61n4,1579186871.0,"I mean, I'm sure Bezos could have gotten more liquid assets but none of the billionaires actually have billions of dollars. They have assets valued at billions of dollars. So the way it works for the ultra rich is that that net worth gets them perks that others don't get. They largely get a lot of stuff comped as a pseudo *quid pro quo* and they can leverage those assets to do things other people need liquid assets for (like get financing). 

So if Bezos needs 10 million to fund a business venture, he just has to make a proposal for how that venture will make money and then banks will lend him that 10 mil leveraged against his net worth. The bank knows it won't lose money and so they will make money through the lend. Bezos gets the ""cash"" he needed without ever having the cash.

But donations require you to have the liquid funds. No loan either, because they lender doesn't see how a donation is profitable (it isn't, that's the point). So the ultra rich make donations by either selling non-liquid assets or by cutting into whatever liquid assets they've built up. You never want sell non-liquid assets if at all possible because those get more value out of being leveraged, like in the above example. So basically they only tap into whatever ""cash"" they've let themselves keep, which is usually comparatively low to their net worth because cash is one of the weakest forms of an asset. You make more money by having your estate tied up in things that generate more money and cash just doesn't do that, at least not that well.

tl;dr The ultra wealthy could probably still pitch in more for charitable donations, no argument there, but using their net worth as an indicator of how much cash they have on hand is a flawed viewpoint."
TrollYChromosome,fehemio,t1_fegw3q3,1579114958.0,"This is extremely solid advice. Source? I'm a university professor and I teach these skills to our freshmen who end up on academic probation (<2.0 GPA) after first term. 

It's the difference between recall and recognition. If I were to show you several major logos, you'd recognize them instantly. But the second I tell you to draw the logos from memory, you are prone to error.

Other studying methods that are solid and help you prime your brain to take information out (instead of trying to just put it in) are things like writing summaries of your notes/textbooks from memory (and focusing on your own wording instead of the book's buzzwords/catch phrases) and writing practice essay responses. Also teaching others the material works really well if the other person doesn't know it because they will ask a lot of questions and really challenge your ability to think on the fly.

Final teacher plug here - note cards are a great tool that should be used for a very narrow/specific purpose. Trying to learn everything through note cards is like trying to build a house with just one tool. It might be possible, but the end result won't be high quality. You need to match study methods to learning objectives. A foreign language class relies heavily, at least at first, on memorization. Note cards are great for that. Other courses may assume you've memorized some material but are really more about the *application* of that material, so note cards won't really get you there."
