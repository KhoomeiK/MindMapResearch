gaming,femcmep,t3_epvemd,1579248721.0,I have no clue how a repost of the top post from a few days ago managed to get 8k upvotes. Hax
gaming,femckpv,t1_femc4gs,1579248658.0,Rightfully so
fo4,feku37b,t1_fejl5ui,1579207622.0,"Hm. She only appears if the quest initiates. 

If the quest didn't pop up, then it either means you've taken the quest before at some point in your playthrough, or the game hella bugged out.

Check your pip boy, under miscellaneous to see if you've taken the quest before. If it's not there, and you dont have it pending. Then I'd say that's a good sign. You dont have to worry about the bugged quest anymore."
fo4,fejit03,t1_fejiil0,1579176095.0,"Be careful. If you read a log named ""Samuel"". You'll start a quest. You wont be able to talk to her again, and that quest may linger. Unless you have a save file just after you've talked with her.

Chances are, the game might unbug. So after checking the terminal, make sure you dont move, and wait for her to approach you. Then you can complete the quest."
fo4,fejicnr,t1_fejia60,1579175552.0,"She's bugged unfortunately. You can shoot her, without any repercussions. 

People speculate her to be plain out crazy, and killed her own son cause she was coo coo. Guess that'll make you feel better if you wanna pull that trigger.

I couldn't shoot her. So she's bugged and will stay there forever."

pcmasterrace,feh0kp6,t1_fegf5e3,1579106620.0,"That's true. Usually the game is set to 180° of vision. This is so, for some games like Horizon Zero Dawn, only what you're looking at is rendered. Everything else behind you de-loads."

dataisbeautiful,fegzi1y,t3_ep0l6b,1579105969.0,"I'm always surprised when I see Eminem, especially two of his 20 mil+ albums.

Considering how the list was dominated by rock, pop, never thought I'd see a Rap artist chart."
nextfuckinglevel,fegyzx3,t1_fegqk5s,1579105659.0,The parents are probably far more concerned about his well being and the surgery. They want the doctor's attention on their child so the surgery goes smoothly.

fo4,fecmyxz,t1_fecc4f4,1578977940.0,"Amen to that. While it isnt in my top 5, the open world is easily one of the best I've ever seen.

I mean plenty did like the game, here on the game's subreddit, but steam reviews and metacritic user scores? Not so favourable. Sad people always compare it to 3 and NV."
dankvideos,fea0f6d,t3_enx0y8,1578943095.0,"Why, what were they trying to achieve with this experiment here?"
fo4,fe941f6,t1_fe92y5b,1578933974.0,"Yeah I believe I've invested 2 or 3 points into it. My total carry capacity is about 320.

And sometimes that's still not enough. I guess it's because of all the weapons I'm carrying, I like to have atleast 1 weapon of each ammo type."
fo4,fe8so3u,t1_fe8rzo8,1578930222.0,"Oh wow thanks for the tips!

I havent looked into modding my power armour yet, I just use the basic one (at Concord) and 2 others I found on my travels. I'll keep that in mind!

I guess I could give the fat man to dog meat. No way its gonna use it right?....

Thank you!"
fo4,fe8r16t,t1_fe8ql2k,1578929618.0,"Early game those things are heavy! I cant be carrying a fat man at all times, unless later on your storage capacity heavily increases or sumthin."

fo4,fe7mi1a,t1_fe7kij1,1578916500.0,Haha it's fine. You've made me more curious about this tape now!!!
fo4,fe7jxlw,t1_fe7bylx,1578915623.0,"I mean, the main character may not have much backstory but I presume that's deliberate, so you can imagine yourself in his/her shoes. 

Most of the sidequests are independent and only some are intertwined with the main quest. So you can literally not do the main quest at all. Its optional if you will. The game allows you to do whatever you wish, and I think there's beauty to that. You're not constrained, walk wherever you want and discover cool new secrets."
fo4,fe7jd16,t1_fe7fykw,1578915363.0,"Oh wow. I've yet to progress that far in the game, I shall keep a lookout for it."
