Switzerland is a federal state, something the EU first has to become. (I hope so actually as it would be the right direction for a strong EU, check out r/EuropeanFederalists)"
YUROP,ffhhx1o,t1_ffgsyin,1579936002.0,Works too actually. :)
YUROP,ffg9wp5,t3_etbfpf,1579901610.0,EU wanna be more like Switzerland.
socialskills,ffeew94,t3_eswbol,1579845404.0,"I'm really happy for you that you did realize this, it's a big step, perhaps the most difficult in such a situation.

Sadly, it's not for everybody like this. I know from myself, but also observing others, that they can't just change their behaviour due to a psychological disorder, for example ADHD or Autism. 

In my opinion, when reading such positive experiences from others, we should not forget, that its not like this for everybody. There are people which do realize it (being ""the proplem""), maybe even with great self reflection, but simply do have such a differently working brain as the large part of the population, that socializing is very difficult on such a high level and they simply cannot change/handle it.

Conclusion: Maybe it's not only you, but also the chemistry of your brain."

bonehealingjuice,fej8ock,t1_fej6umf,1579161679.0,"Thanks for explaining! If more people like you would more explain themselves, a lot would of social encounters would be much easier. I do myself have ADHD and also struggle sometimes in social situations, that helps."
bonehealingjuice,fej5di9,t1_fej503r,1579157555.0,"Thanks for clarifying. 
But then I'm not sure if you understand the comment correctly.

An ableist is someone hating on people with disorders, diseases etc. So, being an asshole to people on the spectrum (like making fun about their behaviour) is not okay, agree?

The discussion is not about the meme. :)"

Also I can't access my Ledger ETH Wallet over MEW so I can't interact at all with the smart contract which only allows zero value transaction..."
