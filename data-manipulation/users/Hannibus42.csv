Let's say I took a die that had a side for every possible point in the observable universe (a 50 billion light-year diameter sphere) multiplied by every Plane in the standard Great Wheel Cosmology described in the PHB and DMG, and rolled it once for every single atom in the body of an Ancient Red Dragon. (There are approximately 200 billion atoms in one strand of DNA.)

Not to mention that this event would be purely random, whereas my existence is more a mix of quantum randomness and macro-scale determinism. 
I'd also like to bring up the Anthropic Principle; essentially, it doesn't matter how unlikely it is that all existence would out in a way that allows us to be here, because obviously we wouldn't exist in any of the universes that wouldn't allow us.
