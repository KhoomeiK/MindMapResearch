Psychonaut,ffhhb8f,t1_ffhg8t2,1579935226.0,"Hey thanks for the reply! Want more rambles? No? Well here’s what I just typed in my notes:

.
“Consciousness OF something”. Sartre’s words. Know why consciousness has to be “of something”? Because all something, is consciousness. Wherever there is a consciousness at any particular point in space and time, of whatever form it happens to be—is that. It doesn’t “emerge” out of physical things. It is those things.

Infinitely connected, infinitely divided.

Any judgement you may make on anything,
—is you, that consciousness of that moment
—is a biological mechanism (so, a feature of that present-you), and thus not necessary if you are one who is in a comfortable-enough environment. Being one who has the time to type on a phone, and not chase down my food on foot for several hours, I’d say I pretty much don’t have to worry. And when I do worry about something? Don’t worry about that worrying. If you remember all the above, then there is no utility in fact-checking yourself, meaning, for the consciousness to turn inward in hopes to understand itself a little better. Just a “negative form”, is all."

Hopefully I don’t sound too pretentious, and that you understand what I’m saying. No need to be upset at Existence’s existence, but no need to feel otherwise. You’re a rationality-driven machine, analyzing and so forth. Let  be. The show continues.

And I’m also saying this to remind myself. It’s easy to dismiss the whole “we are all one” mindset as bullshit, since the words seem to get bland after a little while. But...idk. I feel like if I were to truly internalize that thought, then, as a human being with all my psychological tendencies and everything, I may feel more at peace. Simply because that’s how the mind works. But idk, I’m rambling at this point."
