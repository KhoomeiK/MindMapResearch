InsanePeopleQuora,fcs8j7l,t3_eilybt,1577912950.0,"I had a friend who was 17 and got his 16 year old girlfriend. He was charged as an adult with 2nd degree sexual assault of a minor. He received probation and also had a no contact order with her. He was a minor and was told to have no contact with minors. He could not see his girlfriend or child. Before I go further I want to clarify that in my state a victim doesn’t have to press charges. If my state believes a crime is committed they will assume the role of victim and press charges. Also, in my state hearsay is allowed as evidence. Anyway, my friend was still in high school. Kind of hard to avoid contact with minors. He turned 18 his senior year. His life was better even with his prior charges. He was on the football team. He was popular. The students at his school knew his circumstances. He got a new girlfriend. A classmate. She was 17. He was revoked and sent to prison for ten years for violating his probation for being in a relationship with his classmate. My state doesn’t have the Romeo Juliet law. He spent seven years of a ten year sentence fighting the system tooth and nail to get his case overturned. It took 7 years, but he did it. He came home from a decision by our state Supreme Court. It took a lot of money and time. His family is now broken. They went into debt and he is dealing with stigmas and mental health issues. I’m just glad that he is still alive and didn’t take his own life over it."
