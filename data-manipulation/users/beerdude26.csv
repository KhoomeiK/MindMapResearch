I think Aster Multiseat is your best option. There's a guy on YouTube that shows how he lets his kids play Fortnite on an Aster multiseat setup. He also has an affiliate link you can use to get a discount on the software.

What I did before this, was provide the game files already installed on a USB stick that everyone could run the games off of directly. This does result in annoying stuff like having to install libraries like the XML library you need for Age Of Mythology etc, on some people's computers. There should also be 64-bit binaries for the older Age games floating on the internet, these fix a lot of the weird issues you get on Win10."
