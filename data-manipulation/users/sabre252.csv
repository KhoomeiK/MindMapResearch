BFS,ff7cqbq,t1_ff7bsc8,1579646515.0,Sorry for the double reply - it's extremely unlikely (in my opinion) that your doc chose not to tell you something. She might have a suspicion or a hunch but it's VERY unprofessional to withhold concrete info from a patient.

NavyBlazer,ff6xlo8,t3_erzgk9,1579636973.0,"This was apparently a thing to do a few years ago during the height of the Bean Boot Bonanza.  There was some article in the NYT about finance bros pairing Bean boots with suits. But this was when some rando offered me double in cash for the boots I bought while I was strolling through Bear Parking in Freeport without even seeing the size. It was nuts!

Right now? pass. I will sometimes fudge church attire and wear Bean boots with khakis and a sweater if it's muddy. I even wore them with a blazer and khakis a few winters ago when it was really sloppy up in Maine."

Remember ""shot"" was mostly just  a cannonball. They weren't generally using exploding shells. So, the shot would just put holes in the ship. Heating it increased the chances of more damage."
todayilearned,ff3hyvq,t1_ff3h01x,1579541433.0,I suppose the more charitable view is that it was a time of upheaval and a group that they saw as terrorists (however wrongly) were about to take over. I’m sure racism played a part but so did real fear of the unknown. It was the first time a government with nukes started to disintegrate (They gave up their nukes in 1989 while apartheid didn’t end until 1994 so it was pretty much contemporaneous with the fall of the USSR).
todayilearned,ff3cr3f,t1_ff3ceju,1579538550.0,They were definitely afraid. They also saw a decline in the strategic threat they feared with the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola with the Tripartite Accord.
todayilearned,ff30x24,t1_ff2f5wq,1579530720.0,"Ukraine never had operational control of their nukes. They inherited the physical missiles and warheads from the Soviet Union. However, command and control remained with Moscow. They managed to trade the assets for some aid. 

Libya never had nukes. They had an advanced program. They gave it up to normalize relations with the US after 9/11. 

The only country to possess and then give up  actual nuclear weapons capability was South Africa."

This doesn't remove her ultimate responsibility but it does call into question where her parents or guardians were? Did her doctors follow up when she failed to? Refer her to nutritionists? There's a lot of blame to go around here."

AskReddit,fevv4zk,t1_fevujyc,1579401901.0,"Really it's the catchall term in the US for your primary care ""person"" - for some it's your family doc for others it's a nurse practitioner or physician's assistant. Some women I know only have an OB/GYN so they get pressed into service as a GP AND specialist.

Whoever is your first ""port of call"" for medical assistance. My guess is that GP is not used super widely in America because that implies you're seeing a doctor specialized in general practice... and you may not be. You may only get a doctor doctor after you're ""escalated"""
AskReddit,fevt2nk,t1_fevr5ew,1579401119.0,That rule is great for jargon but PCP is a commonly used term and context clues should have filled everyone in. Just like I shouldn't have to let everyone know what NASA means. Reddit is a silly place!
AskReddit,fevh9h1,t1_fev2bap,1579397411.0,"Hey - don't be freaked out but do get it checked. Definitely mention it to your doc. Could be lots of things - sleep deprivation, depression, seizures.

As far as I know, if something is wrong it's generally very treatable and the testing is probably an EEG which is non-invasive (just sticky pads on your head).

My in-laws are docs and their favorite expression is, ""if you think it's worth  getting checked out, it is!"" - they don't think you're wasting their time. They want to help and they're glad if nothing is wrong!

AskReddit,feutrdz,t1_feusdn2,1579389807.0,"Oh yeah - you are totally right. if you have a TIA or experience any of those symptoms, definitely go to the hospital! 

It's REALLY hard to differentiate a stroke from a TIA - only trained medical staff should be doing it. As you say, there are treatments if one is coming or you're having one...but time is limited! Don't take risks, don't pass go, go right to the ER - it's serious stuff!"
AskReddit,feus0qd,t1_feulq4u,1579389358.0,"They can be a warning sign of something more serious. The studies cited on Wikipedia say that of the people who have a TIA, 1/3 go on to have recurrent TIAs and another 1/3 go on to have a stroke. 

I didn't dig into it though - there's no mention of whether that's just descriptive or whether there's any statistical power there (i.e. a person who has a TIA is more likely to have a stroke than the counterfactual same person who didn't have one)."
