IndustrialDesign,ff2r7vy,t3_er9lgp,1579520472.0,"I think collaboration with a chef/cook for insight would help, to be honest I don’t know much about ID I only just accepted my offer, but reading your post as someone who runs a household with a full time job and does 95% of the meal prep/cooking it feels like you need to observe time, cost, space, user friendliness and sustainability factors. Not sure if that helped in the slightest."
Advice,ff2qv4r,t3_eqyle2,1579519957.0,"Congrats on the offer man! I hope you find what you want to do, I’ve got a bit of experience with similar stuff to what you’re going through and now training as well. If you ever need an ear shoot me a message, fellow Aussie so shouldn’t be too long of a wait. 
Best of luck man"
