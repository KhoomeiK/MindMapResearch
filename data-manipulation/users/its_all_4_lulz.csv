AskReddit,fglqn9d,t1_fgkztqr,1580908330.0,"In my opinion, the Benzos are easier to quit. After 3 months nic free I gave in to the vape habit because I couldn’t handle life anymore. Couldn’t do my job, because my mind wouldn’t focus and the anxiety that was giving me was too much. Had zeroooo energy. We also had someone close to us die a month in too so it likely contributed. Started anti deps that just made me want to punch something (Wellbutrin), but didn’t fix any of the other stuff. Grabbed a vape thing and the world went back to normal. Doctors told me “it’s better than smoking, so if it works then go for it”.

PublicFreakout,fg0i5y6,t1_fg0fs3z,1580408291.0,"I can’t speak for video as I’ve only really done still photography, but having adjustments that are sloppy can make a big difference. For instance, you’re trying to frame something just right, so you loosen all of the moving parts, set the scene as you want it, then go tighten everything up. A bad stand will move your camera as you tighten. Not a huge deal when shooting a large scene, but can completely destroy a picture when trying to be precise. You also don’t want the moving parts to be jerky. 

Try doing some close up macro work and these things become very relevant. 1/8” of movement, at macro size, is the difference between being in focus and not even being able to see the target. Similar can be said when trying to shoot space or high zoom."

BeAmazed,ffk6va1,t1_ffjvvl0,1580017805.0,"As others mention, it’s different for everyone. I had agoraphobia from 2007 until 2015. Now I still avoid some things but have a huge range in comparison to what I used to. Basically, if I went anywhere with a lot of people, or places that were “trapping” (like the exit is far away), I would start to shake, turn white, feel like I was about to pass out. Sometimes my legs would forget how to work. All this while your mind is going at speed 1000x trying to figure out what is causing it, how to stop it, or how to get out ASAP. 

Now and then I eat what seems to be generalized anxiety, which feels panic attackish. That one causes sleepless weeks, waking up with a resting heartbeat of 180, complete loss of appetite, constant tingling and pain throughout the body, again while your mind is racing trying to figure it out.
