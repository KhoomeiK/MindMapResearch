AskReddit,fecur8b,t3_eodtd1,1578985412.0,"My nephew is a brilliant, kind, musically talented young man who was raised in a religious cult, but escaped at age 15. He did Running Start, graduated HS early and enlisted in the Marines after 9/11. He served for 6 years, learning Arabic to be a crypto-translater for the intelligence wing, and then furthered his education into deep analysis and working his way toward a career in business theory while developing his own drone photography company.

Then, about a year ago, he went off of his bi-polar meds in favor of vaping weed. I noticed a change in his communication, and could tell he was not himself, but I thought he was just coming into his late 20s as a new kind of person. He got into an argument with his girlfriend, and somehow went from nice guy to choking her out over nothing. He's currently in jail, and probably for a long time, because he refuses to believe he did anything wrong. Other friends have tried to help him, but they get blown off. I really miss him, but I'm reluctant to communicate, because he's even told my parents that I'm not his friend, which is heartbreaking."

Myself, I'd be in a lounge chair watching them land, and then being brothers and sisters of the planet."
