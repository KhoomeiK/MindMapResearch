Three days after the surgery he was incredibly strong and running around the house like crazy. We went on car rides, played in the back yard, and he was back to his old self. Unfortunately, about a month after I posted this, a lump started growing on his neck next to wear the surgical incision was. The doc did a biopsy and sent in for results, and unfortunately she came back with the news that it was terminal cancer and he'd have about 2 months left to live. He made it about 3 months, until finally this morning I decided it was time to and say goodbye. He was the purest soul I've ever met, and I'm sad to lose him, but I'm happy he's no longer in pain. See you again one day, my loyal friend!"
