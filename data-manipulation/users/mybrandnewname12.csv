it works as normal without this hook."
wholesomegifs,ff6mju4,t3_erww3i,1579630390.0,this is dang adorable
StardewValley,ff4z32z,t3_erhaox,1579575917.0,"damn it. i am pregnant and craving froot loops sooooo badly, but forget to get them when i was out. i was playing stardew valley to try to forget how badly i want these things and DANG IT THERE THEY ARE ON SDV REDDIT FRONT PAGE AAAAAHHHH"
TaylorSwift,ff3wgs9,t3_er71k1,1579550352.0,"I'm with you. I actually can never even remember how it goes, its so forgettable to me. To make my brain recall this song, I literally have to sing ""angels roll their eyes, devils roll the dice"" in order for the next part of the song to click. I can not recall the chorus, ever, without first doing this. It just isn't a song I see the draw to."
TaylorSwift,fenfh3u,t1_fem0ve1,1579283558.0,"I posted a link to them all in chronological order, and within that post I linked to the original person to loaded them all. Check post history :)"

educationalgifs,feh956w,t1_feg5d9g,1579111722.0,my sons are SOOOO into frozen right now (just the first) and this comment made me LOL. thanks!
TaylorSwift,fegrunj,t1_feff0vp,1579101074.0,"omg these ""ugh her mind"" comments kill  me. everyone needs to calm down."
TaylorSwift,feepmfr,t3_eohk7v,1579038563.0,"""i have feen"""
StardewValley,fedq620,t1_fedjw9z,1579017488.0,"forgive /u/Toggdor, OP posted ""greenhouse"" in the title. I too was confused"
TaylorSwift,fdqqjkw,t1_fdgqhfu,1578672734.0,"in your defense, you probably don't have a team working on you :)"
educationalgifs,fdnt327,t1_fdlymkk,1578592279.0,"It looks very close. I am not sure what ""amble"" would be for horses. (source: have ridden horses for 20+ years, and went to horse college for a year before I realized that it was a stupid life choice)"
educationalgifs,fdnszrn,t1_fdmg1tu,1578592226.0,"I don't think so.. I think they're all different. Walk has 4 beats, amble looks like 2 beats (its hard to tell). Pace is 2, Trot is 2, Canter 3 and Gallop also 4. I would say that if you're going to ""group"", amble, pace and trot would be grouped together."
wholesomegifs,fdkhnp4,t3_elvcl6,1578504068.0,"its moderately cool, but wholesome? i don' tknow"
educationalgifs,fdh9xb8,t1_fdh5fa9,1578418545.0,"i'm reading these words, and the OP, but for some reason my brain can not comprehend the meaning"
educationalgifs,fdh9tu1,t1_fdh8sp4,1578418487.0,this cracked me up. thanks for posting
StardewValley,fdh1b5p,t3_el8vp9,1578413219.0,This is so darn lovely. I'd spend all my time here!
StardewValley,fdgw9a4,t1_fdgv95h,1578409886.0,thank you! i've been wondering that myself!
StardewValley,fdgw7xo,t1_fdgvxay,1578409860.0,"i really like it personally. i play on my phone and my computer close to equally. it can be confusing to switch back and forth between the two, but its really fantastic IMO. it might not be worth it if you play on the Switch (because that can already come with you places) but to switch between PC and mobile is great, IMO. they each have their pros and cons"
wholesomegifs,fdgw39l,t3_el96w7,1578409771.0,oh my goodness is this the cutest thing ever. that baby is so so excited! it makes it even more special!!!
StardewValley,fd068pr,t1_fczq5qk,1578114246.0,"We actually played tonight for an hour!!! It went by fast. He wanted to start a new farm together so we did that. He didn‚Äôt love it but he could see the potential since I talked to him a lot about that it isn‚Äôt just ONLY doing chores, eventually you go out and do other things. Well see :)"
StardewValley,fcyyy7u,t1_fcyr5hk,1578090179.0,wow I might have to do this on mine. i bet he'd like that better vs starting from scratch. i considered starting a farm for us and playing for like 10 hours to get us a little further and then inviting him. i never considered you could just open it like that. that's a game changer!!
StardewValley,fcyyu6y,t1_fcy5h0d,1578090107.0,"I'm trying to get my husband to play. I said ""can you try for an hour and if you hate it I'll never bother you again!"" we'll see ;)"
StardewValley,fcyyt3v,t1_fcylfsu,1578090089.0,hahah. at least she has a good reason
StardewValley,fcyyp04,t1_fcyuhmv,1578090015.0,yes i 100% learned a lesson today! what a bummer!
StardewValley,fcyyo15,t1_fcyu6qt,1578089998.0,"aaaahhhh that would be more awful than the coal i think!!!! on the plus side, it pushed me ahead a level in mining ;)"
StardewValley,fcysoox,t1_fcysar9,1578086240.0,"I knowww I have that too but I was actively putting Gold in the kilns too, I guess its pretty good I didn't accidentally ship my entire gold stash. I've learned a lesson about being more careful"
StardewValley,fcyedvd,t1_fcybk6y,1578078880.0,You did well coming up with it on a short notice :)
StardewValley,fcyaz4p,t3_ejifib,1578077406.0,"I don't mean to be a jerk but I don't recognize you as Shane even knowing you are dressed up as Shane. I'm sorry, that isn't a very nice comment, but I don't mean it to be mean, just being honest"

educationalgifs,fctc4c5,t1_fct19ug,1577938654.0,"On my third pregnancy, about 6 weeks in. The first two I barely had any symptoms. This one, I‚Äôm sick and sooo tiiirreedd. It‚Äôs unbelievable to me how different this is from the first two, and I now understand how lucky I was the first times! Omg!!!"

StardewValley,fckgr4o,t1_fckg1wd,1577724968.0,Right??!
TaylorSwift,fckgjlr,t1_fck8hgy,1577724836.0,That‚Äôs good! But your doc might not ‚Äúallow‚Äù you to go if it‚Äôs far. I say ‚Äúallow‚Äù because they can‚Äôt stop you. I went to a concert an hour away at 36 weeks and didn‚Äôt tell my doc - it was strongly advised being that far away.
TaylorSwift,fchcbnf,t3_egjwca,1577649229.0,"Will you be traveling for Loverfest? Keep in mind if you are,  you might not be able to if you‚Äôd be due that close to the fest date"
wholesomegifs,fbfl7bt,t1_faxr4xf,1576813312.0,"UPDATE!
bought them on amazon and as it was shipping found out I was pregnant. So I got to scare the crap out of my husband AND let him know he was expecting a kid!"
