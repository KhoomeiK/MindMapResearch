Assuming someone’s nationality because of what they look like is kinda shitty, particularly since not everyone is capable of distinguishing the required features, and even doing so would necessitate to assume that certain traits belong to certain nationalities. And that assumption requires to have “experience” with those ethnicities. 

Something like that happens to me all the time, because of a funny combination of genetics, I look like a certain ethnicity and people always assume I’m from there, even though not only I’ve never even set foot in the place, neither of my parents have a genetic connection with the area."
