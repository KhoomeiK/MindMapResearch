But with an engagement ring, it can be more than that and even if it's not to your taste, the gesture is meaningful and you can always reset it or get an ""everyday"" ring afterwards.

He would be doing it to show her how much he and his family love her."

My sister is fighting cancer right now.  Everyone in the family bought t-shirts and hoodies expressing our support and part of the money went to research.  For example, my shirt says ""I wear purple for my sister: Leiomyosarcoma awareness"".  My husband's says ""no one in this family fights alone.""  Maybe you can do something like that?"
