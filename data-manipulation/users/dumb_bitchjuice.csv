Here’s the [screenshots](https://twitter.com/bigmoneyonision/status/1219329371132948480?s=21)"
fatlogic,fenm3ka,t3_eq0je2,1579287610.0,"I’m 5’3” and my highest weight was around 160, the only way that person could be that slim is if their weight came from both muscle and fat. Yeah, I was fat, but I had good muscle foundation from when I was a kid. Now that I have my diet under control I’m 125 and still feel a lil flabby. The average woman does not have that much muscle mass lol."

Onision,feiokxl,t3_epcoi2,1579143378.0,"When I was 14-15 (6-7 years ago, I’m also a girl) I watched his stuff. I thought his content on self harm, religion, and body image was impactful to me because he was so straightforward. Now looking back his content is super harmful and I was never “cured” with anything he said. It was basically like him yelling into a void about “self harm bad, god not real” and my young teen self ate that up. I thought his “comedy” sketches were unbearably cringy so I avoided those. He’s very convincing in the way he speaks and that’s scary thinking of all the shit he got himself into now.

Eventually he got repetitive and boring so I unsubbed. I never visited the forums, I was more focused on his videos (unfortunately lol)."
fatlogic,fe5zzxa,t1_fe5z7sx,1578878722.0,Pretty sure he’s referring to Every Damn Day Fitness on youtube haha

fatlogic,fdyhqko,t1_fdy6zna,1578779933.0,"American Eagle sizes made me hate myself lol, all their stuff runs super small. I regularly fit into size 6 jeans but could barely squeeze into a 10 there."

I’m more concerned with how bare your tank is.. if you want to reduce overall stress I would fill that tank up with plants and hides."
relationship_advice,fdiqzbb,t3_ehvj9t,1578449079.0,"Fuck there’s a lot to unpack here... I genuinely think if nothing is done now, he will continue illegally importing meat or hunting endangered animals and get himself arrested. If you can think of someway to support your mom or her side of the family, I would do so and then report your father to the authorities. If he keeps going, he could potentially get your mother in a lot of legal trouble, too. I’m so sorry you have to go through this, that’s so sick and twisted.."

I work with a shelter that also does public spaying/neutering and you could potentially seek legal action for them doing a procedure as a “surprise” and charging you for it.
If it needs to be done, they definitely should have contacted you. If they can’t get ahold of you, they shouldn’t do it, period."

Cancer might take them away physically, but it’ll never take the loving, amazing memories away that stay with you forever."
