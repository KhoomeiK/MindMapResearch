I’m confused why you say there was no quid pro quo. Mick Mulvaney more or less admits it when he said “we do this all the time” (not sure if that’s the direct quote).[They froze the money in July and it was released conspicuously close to the news of the whistleblower (on September 11)](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/oct/07/us-aid-ukraine-donald-trump-froze-one-), especially when [he’d been briefed about the whistleblower in late August](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/us/politics/trump-whistle-blower-complaint-ukraine.html). 

On top of that the White House refused to supply all requested documents for the inquiry and when they did, [were almost entirely redacted](https://theweek.com/speedreads/884045/white-house-released-documents-about-trumps-ukraine-aid-freeze-but-theyre-almost-entirely-redacted). 

We also have career diplomats, who served under both conservative and liberal administrations who testified that any investigation into Ukraine was was unnecessary as it’d already been disproven. So the whole investigating for the US makes no sense since multiple intelligence agencies already verified it was a lie perpetrated by Russian intelligence. 

I don’t think the investigation nor the impeachment was a sham because what was done looked like quid pro quo and in the course of investigating, the White House obstructed that investigation."
