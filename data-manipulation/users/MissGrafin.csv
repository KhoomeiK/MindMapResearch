Even if cats are spayed, they still do this if you touch the base of their tails. It’s an erogenous zone. The back of the neck is another spot, but is much less sensitive to that kind of stimulation."

railroading,ff8eg8c,t1_ff8dxgx,1579675019.0,"A strong, close, relationship is definitely a step in the right way. I’ve worked divorced and seen every tooth and rail spike fought over to the bitter end. I’ve seen how it kills people, twists and warps them, and destroys otherwise great kids. 

I also grew up military, so I feel that gives me an edge in the “missing person at work” department. The Military owns you, the railway owns you... The only difference is that the railway doesn’t send you into an active war zone for 6-12 months, 100’s of miles from home. (Just 24-36 hours! Lol.)

When I said not communicate, I was more or less: Spouse is on a train in the middle of nowhere. Shit hits the fan at home. Getting your spouse off a train and home - unless a major, life altering emergency - is impossible. You can’t just call up your spouse whenever and ask them to leave work or tell you what to do. If shit hits the fan and the at home spouse can’t deal with simple to slightly more advanced “emergencies”, they’re either not cut out for that life, or will find someone to “take care of them” in your absence.

But, I will agree, some of the old railroaders see their wife as another toy. Tell them nothing, expect them to do everything for them and be complacent, and expect them to be a domestic servant."

railroading,ff88xq8,t3_es1grh,1579669466.0,"As someone whose husband is on the railway, someone who was on the railway, and someone who has worked in a law office doing divorces for the railway.... I can say one thing with incredible certainty: these wives complaining are likely gold diggers and only with their spouse for the money. They are also bored.

Being a rail wife isn’t easy. It’s incredibly comparable to being a military wife. Your spouse is gone for an undetermined amount of time with minimal contact. A lot of wives are stay-at-home moms with little to no work history or skills (or desire to change that). Many of them also get into MLM’s to feel like they are contributing (they’re not). They don’t function on their own and if you’re not there, they will fill that void with someone else.

The one thing I always tell new railway wives/spouses: “If your partner is at work and unreachable, and say the sump in the basement lets go and starts flooding the joint, will you know what to do?”


If the answer is get in there and deal with it, great.

If the answer is “I don’t know” or “I’ll just get so-and-so to do it”. They’re not ready to deal with life in your absence."
