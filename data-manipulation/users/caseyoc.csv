exjw,fednspb,t1_fedb12j,1579015992.0,"Agreed.  Born-ins are in a terrible position in this way.  It was our own parents (or their parents) who chose the religion, not us.  Growing up, we believe what our parents tell us is true--why would our own parents lie to us?   While they don't realize what they are telling us is lies and they'd never cop to it, the things they tell us about Jehovah, Armageddon, the world, etc. are not true.  Once we realize that, we're caught over a barrel because we face losing our loved ones or trying to live with the cognitive dissonance and emotionally abusive culture of the JWs.

When your parents (or theirs, whatever) made the choice to become Witnesses, they chose a religion that they **knew** might eventually cause them to cut off their non-believing children.  Those children raised as JWs aren't given the same choice.  It's just ""believe or die at Jehovah's hand."""
AskReddit,fdqr0c0,t1_fdpdg72,1578673019.0,"Please, everyone, look after your vulnerable friends--those with asthma, heart or lung conditions, the obese, etc.  I lost a friend a few years ago during a terrible fire season because her heart just couldn't keep up with all the usual strains on it, plus the addition of the terrible air quality from wildfires (US).  The smoke may be that one extra factor that tips a vulnerable person's health into extreme danger."

gifs,fdqje0v,t1_fdorq8y,1578668114.0,"There are international agreements in place between the US & AUS/NZ, US & Canada, etc. to allow them to request help and vice versa.  The agreements specify that we simply bill the other country for the expenses of sending firefighters.  I'm not certain whether employees' labor (40 hours a week or whatever they're guaranteed by their home department) is reimbursed by the receiving country or not, but travel, overtime and associated expenses are.  When the feds request firefighters from other countries, it's agreed that we'll pay their expenses accordingly.

tl;dr There's no budget set aside for US federal firefighters to go train in other countries--the costs are paid by the receiving country."

gifs,fdo8pqt,t1_fdo493h,1578600827.0,AUS/NZ sends firefighters to the US pretty regularly.  Seems like every 3-5 years we get a big contingent of them up here.  We like to return the favor when we can.  Other countries are doing the same--I think I saw a post here the other day with some firefighters from Singapore getting ready to go.
gifs,fdo8fu0,t1_fdo1j0d,1578600693.0,"The hosting country typically provides the proper safety clothing for the visiting firefighters.  Australia is giving US firefighters who run chainsaws specialized boots (steel toe) because US wildland firefighters don't wear them.  I have a hard time believing the AUS folks wouldn't outfit the Danes with proper Nomex.

exjw,fc5q2zd,t3_eg9j6v,1577463522.0,"Well, I was DF'ed in '96 at age 21.  I guess I qualify for this.  My dad was a non-believer, my mom was all-in.  One big thing for me was desperately wanting to go to the prom.  I wasn't baptized and I had my dad's support, so my mother just said, ""Make your own decision.""  I wasn't going to get a date, so one of the exchange students and I went together (both girls, friends, no big deal).  Didn't go out to dinner or anything, just went to the dance.  The elders found out and I got counseled for my bad associations.  But at least I can say I went to one high school dance in my life!

I got absolutely zero attention from JW guys (maybe because I wasn't so obviously all-in as other women?), but had attention from worldly guys.  I had a couple of clandestine boyfriends in school, and tried so hard to be secret squirrel about it because there was a JW boy in the class below me who was my own personal Morality Cop and would nark on me if he saw anything even remotely sketch, and sometimes even when he didn't see anything.  Little rat...  It was ridiculously, unnecessarily stressful.  

I ended up getting baptized after I graduated, and only stayed a believer about a year after that.  I was quite disappointed when I didn't get a magical, tingly feeling when I got baptized.  I really thought I would and that everything would be different.  It wasn't."
