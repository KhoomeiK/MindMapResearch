Showerthoughts,fek39ob,t1_fek2nj7,1579191688.0,"I once lived in an apartment that was across the road from a car dealership that decided to get a mobile LED billboard to advertise their opening.  Instead of pointing the super-bright billboard toward traffic on the main road they pointed it at my building.  The bright light kept my bedroom lit up all night long.

I listed it on google maps as a place of worship, it was accepted by google ('church of the neon light' or something) and showed up on maps.  I screenshotted it, emailed it to the car dealership the next day and the billboard disappeard.  I still have the acceptance email from google in my inbox, and screenshots of it.  Screw you, silly car yard."

Two gold, one silver, and some '2020 Vision' award just for having a giggle about car parking and minimum wage.  It's perked me up enough to start writing some code this evening, which I haven't done in months.

Showerthoughts,fej1a29,t1_fej0xdr,1579153293.0,"A friend of mine is into real estate investing.  When airbnb took off he ran some numbers and found the returns on a houseboat were fantastic when compared to buying an apartment.  Apartment?  $100k+.  Boat?  $10k.  Both got the same nightly rate from airbnb and the upkeep/insurance on the boat were a tiny fraction of that for an apartment.  Guess who went boat shopping that afternoon?

And yes, he also owns parking spaces."
Showerthoughts,fej0rhj,t1_fej0c1d,1579152805.0,"Yep, sure can.  Google 'buy parking space' and add your city in there.  All done.

And renting out the space that comes with your apartment is usually absolutely fine as long as you check with the building management first.  Various websites and apps allow you to do this.  Check https://kerb.works as an example."

Step four: let that car space be the breadwinner of the family, claim yourself as a dependent,  get tax write offs.
