sales,ffj3it8,t3_etu5gj,1579989469.0,"BDR at start up 100%. Here's why:

I'm a Sales professional, now a sales trainer actually, who has worked for 6 companies. My first job out of college was ADP payroll, Paychex's biggest competitor. I know for a fact the scope of the job is exactly the same at ADP (we had several guys from Paychex, and some of us would reguarly meet up with Paychex reps to exchange client lists, secretly obv)

Outside sales for payroll is transactional and kind of gross. It feels skeevy. Depending on what market you're in I guess, but I was in SMB so I reguarly sold to business owners who don't know much about anything... And i was reguarly encouraged to push higher prices, even when i knew the person didn't really know what they were signing up for.

It's also the only sales job I had where my boss would call me and pressure me to go pressure other deals, like that day. You have to go ""footing"" which is where you literally just go knocking on doors... Which feels VERY car salesy.

Oh and working out of your car for 1.5 years? I put 60k miles on my new car and got into 2 accidents. Not saying that will happen to you necessarily but it's a risk you take by driving all day every day.

The only positive I had from ADP was the world class training (Sandler) and my boss was the best sales person I've ever met in my life and ended up becoming my mentor.

How here is why you should be a BDM at a startup. I'm assuming this is a SaaS or tech company? That is the direction the business world is heading in, so working in this industry will lead you in a good place for your career. And this type of sale is not transactional, it's a longer sales cycle so you will have to learn how to manage a pipe for longer times, keeping it warm, nurturing your prospects, etc.

I'm currently in SAAS sales and my last 3 jobs were in SaaS, and it feels significantly more sophisticated than outside payroll sales. Just my 2 cents"
TooAfraidToAsk,ff8u8y2,t3_es8i73,1579696277.0,"...Yeah that's not what they look like. As some people have said, you are likely not noticing dozens of women who do have them, because lip injections generally look natural - that is the point. It's a small minority of people who get the gigantic balloon lips, to which you are referring to. And in those cases, those women probably either wanted to look that way, in which case they don't care if you think they look bad, or they were done wrong, which is a shame.

Many of the things girls do to themselves to look better fly under the radar when done correctly."
solotravel,ff5j39d,t3_erkut0,1579595227.0,"That kind of travel became basic because so many people did it before you that it became a cliché. Wanna know why so many people did it? Because it's fucking awesome.

I will never understand people who shame others for doing popular things. We çant all reinvent the wheel every time we want to try something new, who the hell has time for that?

85% of America's don't have a passport, it you're traveling in general that's impressive as heck right there and you're already more sophisticated than 85% of the US.

Keep on doing you"

solotravel,feqy9ny,t1_fequzgh,1579347393.0,"I completely understand. I'm an expat, but on behalf of people who live here, I'm sorry for my city. It's not ALL like this.. But unfortunately it's enough like this that it happens often.

Ive made posts on here in this sub about my experiences and how I stay safe, if you are interested in reading.

If you need anything at all, message me. I can PM you my Instagram handle. I'm fluent in french and have been here 3 years, it sounds like you have what you need but honestly sometimes it's just nice to have another English speaking woman. (I think you're a woman yes? Lol)

Seriously, if u need anything. French companies give us special cards for restaurants to buy lunch, I can take you to lunch Monday or give you my old shitty android phone. 

I have a personal vendetta against these thugs and I've been robbed 6 times in Paris (not exaggerating) so I know how you feel and I promise I mean it when I say I want to help <3"
solotravel,feqkcui,t3_eq9r56,1579342879.0,"Hey i live here, do you want to meet up quickly? I've been robbed too and I can I guess just share my experience and help you feel not so alone, and I'll buy you a coffee. I have plans this afternoon but if you're free right now I can meet you in like 2 hours. I'm in Pigalle"
paris,feqjoxd,t1_fem24of,1579342605.0,"I know I was just telling her I need her to help me make my IG cooler lol. Go to Tran Tran Zai, it's our favorite place we go once a week!"
The10thDentist,feqiqw0,t3_eqaaoz,1579342345.0,"I have 2 kitties, I'm a woman who lives alone. They cost about 10 bucks a month - 5 for a big bag of food, 5 for a big bag of litter. I brush them myself and play with them myself, so no extra money or effort needed.

They're the cutest little fuckers in the world. The second I open the door, they're standing there excited to see me... And they've usually just woken up because they're blinking their eyes, which means they heard my keys and came running bc they're so excited.

They're hilarious, they fall and bump into things and get into play fights together. If I'm ever sad they come sit on me and cuddle me. When I bring new people over it breaks the ice.

And I travel 2x a month minimum, they can be left 3 days alone no problem, and if it's more than that my housekeeper comes once a week and I arrange for her day to overlap my travels and she feeds them and hangs out with them a bit..

Cats are easy peasy and worth it sooo much for me!"
