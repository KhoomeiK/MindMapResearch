Salvia,ffv0xa3,t3_ev9lph,1580253151.0,"For what seemed like 6 months after taking a break a significant number of my dreams were lucid. Usually with an awareness beyond what I experienced before, more often than not I had God mode basically. Intentions, thoughts &or words had immediate effects, often I'd aim my right hand to direct the abilities. 

I'd say it's because you connect your consciousness with new brain reformatting like ayahuasca does. Or at least because you experience existence in a way similar to being in your dreams, albeit intoxicated etc. Loved the benefits, do audio recordings describing the dream in the morning 5+ minutes every day to improve further."

Who are made of seven billion billion billion.(7 with 27 0's) atoms of this, almost 2/3 is hydrogen, 1/4 is oxygen, and about 1/10 is carbon.

Salvia,ffutvfm,t1_ffu0bdj,1580249242.0,"Entirely possible we're all the universe. Fact is all living things are doing what they want based on the living being they got, and everything that's happened to them. Interactions change a lot potentially, but some beings refuse certain input free will and all. Scientists have viewed reality down to such small a scale they know it's aware too. Hell they basically knew that since the double slit experiment, changing based on the knowledge it's being observed."
Salvia,ffsiu7f,t1_ffs8yud,1580182753.0,"Personally love staying on the knife's edge between reality & beyond while experiencing what ever is on TV as my reality randomly, having the story line seem directed towards you/the trip, altered consciousness, hallucinations... Bravery is a skill to be excersized, but dipping your mind into the ether usually makes you feel called deeper. So 3-6 times a day starting with the dosage I described was how my best friend and I used it."

Call direction then distance description:  left close, right door aware of you, behind JT soon, far end pushing you're on cams. Call Nade as soon as you know it's coming or notice it, you can shoot or impact enemy explosives to take advantage of friendly fire not hurting team mates. Blow their c4/mines/sticky /frag/impacts to save team mates. If you hear proximity mines beeping flip the tip of the aim controller back don't disengage sprint to run back the way you came til it blows. You can go to private with no enemies to practice your aim and see how the guns bullet grouping over distance is. Headshots do additional damage the whole time not just when it makes the noise, the special sound is a headshot knockdown. Bullets have a travel time so after the enemy gets knocked you should either have been strafing or dip into cover to not take those additional bullets. Consider checking for the next living target during the 1 ish second they are invulnerable during the knockdown animation. 

Revive darts and self revive both can either work great or suck, pending on when the revive occurs and if someone deals damage &or gets in front of bullets blocking the downed player. Invulnerable only occurs during the down animation not the revive. Motion sensors don't show player outlines on ninja opponents, and when the game is working you can't hear them unless they are in your vision. Scout is good for knowing if a camper is in a close spot before breaching. Part of your character breaches before you can see, people can hear you crouch and if your weapon hits things."

Salvia,ffo5y6g,t3_euc3rd,1580074453.0,Breaking away from yourself is a few more possibilities away from that point. Although I swear for me the dosage difference is about double from the point where you go through folding ending up in a void or experience existence as an object in your room. Because I'd prefer not to be stuck in a wall on the other end.

Psychedelics,ffkccrb,t3_et61jl,1580020450.0,"My friend of 23 years and I constantly took multiple doses back to back. It's a roulette wheel for sure, but constant set and setting helped us a lot. Things in the room like a timer with minutes and seconds made me recall the experience is just to be witnessed. Releasing control is definitely the response required. 

Personally watching cartoons I loved as a kid while going up the SALVIA scale is my favorite method. In moments of lucidity I recall the story and know I'm safe/aware of what I've been doing. Triggering ah-ha moments where you just know without thinking, that relax you while time seems paused or you have no physical control etc."
Salvia,ffk906r,t1_ffiag4c,1580018939.0,"Salvia loves to make people think about death, and worse not just that you lose this you but they're shutting down reality for good. Having the whole universe destroyed because you took a drug, it's a dick sometimes but you'll come back."
Salvia,ffk8l0z,t3_etutkm,1580018734.0,"It can change who you are for the better so quickly. Take another good look at life, animals and especially the microverse(youtube channel) when you come back from Salvia trips some times. :) Concurrent life times all the way down to the micro with clear awareness that kind of tips the hat we are the universe. Conscious at every level, it's also crazy to know scientists have observed at the smallest level atoms and all their parts are aware."

Knowing how long it has been helps me know when I'm safe to control my physical self and go again as well."
Salvia,ffgcd5w,t1_fffvvs3,1579903111.0,"You can live alternate life time(s) in the space of 6 ish minutes, exist as sound waves, be an alien in a completely different type of society, become literally any inanimate object even an entire different house where anything in it non living you consider you... Existence is existence, you are the universe."
Salvia,ffgb23j,t3_eszf8l,1579902313.0,"Think and say rules to yourself before taking it: I will remain seated, I am experiencing a drug remain calm I'm safe, (when watching a show: pay attention to the story line)... Experiment with the rules: ""describe what you see that you know isn't real"", ""imagine you have unlimited money"", ""pretend you are loved unconditionally by all"" etc on doses where you don't remember ever being you the mindset of the human brain could very well influence you to have a trip based on those types of expiremental rules. 

My favorite thing is watching cartoons I loved as a kid while starting low on the Salvia scale. My idea of low is where all noticeable effects occur without mentally being gone for longer than the trip. Altered state of mind, what ever is on TV can become your reality, story seems directed at you/the trip, inner voice can sound repea-eat-eating-ing-g-g, visuals like folding in the distance/zippers etc. When you experience how real it is, continue to increase the dose til you have a ""no fucking way"" moment. Then when calm and willing double that dose Imho & then get back to us. The method I find best is video/audio record and have a visible timer out of reach every time. Go through each of those stages while watching a continuous story line.

Salvia,ffb7sxl,t3_esdwn6,1579754283.0,"I'd say there's a ton of experiences that you can say ""I wouldn't trade that experience for anything"". Unfortunately negative trips you need to be able to think of it as a dream. You wouldn't let a nightmare ruin your life. I enjoy the lower end of the Salvia scale, different state of mind while watching cartoons you loved as a kid. Where you randomly slip into what ever is on TV, story seems to be based on the trip or directed at you usually."
Salvia,ffb43kt,t3_esezyz,1579751277.0,Absolutely love walking the line of effects where you experience what you are watching on TV with a completely altered state of mind. Potentially slipping in and out of what ever is on the screen as your reality. At the very least it flex's your bravery and lets you become familiar with the experience.

Salvia,ff8ikao,t3_eq7vge,1579680112.0,"Love is the currency of this universe. The universe is indifferent to everyone's suffering, odds are all awareness is the universe experiencing itself. You actively hallucinate reality in order to experience it, but it is made of real things. The building blocks of life are also aware and form their bonds to make their existence easier. History only ever happens how it happens is a thought I keep having, nothing you encode into you carries over to other lives on earth. So now is the only chance as this you to make a difference in your other life times by doing things in the here and now. Plan to do more in your future, the present feels far more constrained, limited possibilities.

They'll tell you what they recall differently, I don't know how how some people might take seeing and hearing that but personally I lived it. Exactly how you would expect being possessed, seeing through my eyes was different, I could hear his thoughts and feel him control my mouth etc. I'd say that was because I pulled about a full bowl of 60x while standing and hadn't ever hallucinated before plus I have aphantasia. Anyway the fact is as a sitter you should keep in mind when they get mentally booted from this reality an alter will take over and their emotions run wild.

Salvia,fea3gmy,t3_ensz9a,1578943943.0,"Interviewed friend of 23 years after life trip when he didn't know it could happen 1.5 hours of the interview: Tire salesman with key bowl by the front door, wife named Susy a daughter Michelle and a son Frank. I remember my daughter walking down stairs with her nose in her phone chewing her gum wearing a belly shirt and short shorts I turn to my wife ""are you letting my daughter dress like this? Can you please talk to her and tell her to put some normal clothes on while I go to work now I don't have time for this"" Next door neighbor was watering his grass, white picket fence, saying something like hey neighbor. I hop into my silver Honda. 

I watched my daughter grow up and get a husband, now that was crazy. I had grand kids. Little Joey and Steve running around the house playing cowboys and Indians. The late nights you had to wake up because you hear knocking from the room next door, which is your daughter's room. And you go in there to find her boyfriend inside her closet. Oh man how quickly I chased him outta the house. I grabbed whatever I could, started swinging it at him saying get away from my daughter get outta my house right now. 

I remember that my wife ended up dieing first. We both grew to be quite old I must've been around 84 when I died. I remember being able to see my daughter and my son they must have been about 60. Them coming to see me in the hospital, that was a heart wrenching moment. As they were worried about me and crying over my bed. It seems the reason I was stuck on a respirator is because my lungs were giving out. 

Drank every once in a while, smoked a dubbie every once and a bit. Silver Honda with AAA insurance. I remember being with my wife as she was having my son first, she went through a 28 hour labor. He may have been 5 pounds 6 ounces, I used to wonder if he'd be a soccer player. He became a football player. You know it's crazy you take the hit, you're born, you go through school, preschool/grade school /high school(the vikings). I remember sitting inside my kindergarten class, the teacher hands us a bunch of M&Ms to teach us how to count a little bit and I ended up taking one of the M&Ms and sticking it up my nose. Learning row row row your boat, gently down the stream, merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream - - - if you see an alligator don't forget to scream! Learned London Bridge is falling down, and ring around the rosie we'd all actually fall down at the end cuz we're all holding hands and skipping in a circle. We sat in an open grass field for the giant parachute. Learned Yankee doodle dandie. I was a Christmas tree in my first play, my face painted red to be an ornament. There was a Christopher Columbus play. I remember having a school crush on a girl that played Pocahontas. Learned to play the recorder, and Christmas carols. I never got into video games. Favorite book was Moby Dick. Books I read: The secret window, the black crow, the dark omen, the red dress. Loved watching CHiPs, saw I dream of genie and M*A*S*H, I love Lucy all the classics like that. At some point I had a 15 inch black and white TV. Car never had a cd player, had a cassette player. Tried riding a motorcycle during his mid life crisis. Started working for 6.95 an hour as a tire salesman at 17 and had 20% commission some how. 

I met my wife in junior high, she was sitting in the front row I was in the back left corner. I was staring at her when the teacher asked me a question, I was too focused on her to know the question and all the other kids laughed at me but she gave me a caring look that made me smile. I had two best friends Joey and Mike, I knew a pervert named Darren. The one ""dream"" I remember was the kind of interlude between dieing there and coming back here. Slight fracture to my right leg falling down stairs, the tibia. Snowboarding quite young hairline fracture to my wrist. I remember smoking a pipe on my front porch in a rocking chair, my two best friends at my side reminiscing about old times. Went fishing on the ocean, caught a small shark once, it fought like hell. Felt like it was pulling the boat, I let it go. Caught tuna and went crabing. Loved the movie Forest Gump, loved lieutenant Dan.

 It's making this life feel very surreal. 

His second life trip he grew up near the ocean with a row boat he ran away once to a cave at one point. Died of a heart attack running in the forest. I'm not going to listen to the audio recording for that one and forgot most of it. I'm certain he believes he experienced these life trips and they felt as real as living this life."

Speaking when it does occur its not always something I'll remember saying because I get thrown into experiencing mini trips, and when it is me I notice randomly how much effort/yelling in order to speak then lower my voice trying to focus again.

We know we're safe to go and come back but the experiences vary so widely, if it didn't have teeth this world could be heaven with all the information gleaned.

Just thinking aloud: He may need help figuring out if he should be working a higher paying job he can do(maybe doesn't know what he can do) or something he can potentially always enjoy no matter the wage(also might not know). Keep in mind that humans are physically animals, for the most part anything either of you feel emotionally is how the animal feels. You could threaten yourself you'll never be with him again and maybe gain insight into if he's worth it?"

RoastMe,fdf4p50,t3_el0lmt,1578353245.0,"We get it: missing yourself counts as being shot at, conjugal visiting your cousin at prison means you've been there. If your body doesn't feel emotions it doesn't consider you a threat, maybe you need to threaten it with starvation but there's no way you'd follow through so that won't fix you.

If they pull the strings they're fucking up left and right. This universe is indifferent to everyone/thing's suffering."

Salvia,fcz354l,t1_fcye3qp,1578092709.0,"Thoughts, inner voice words are such a common point of existence on my way into a trip/during trips. Belief in what you guess is extremely likely for me, no second guessing what I think in the moment. Potentially thinking ""I am thought"", being existencially connected to or only existing as free flowing thought."
Salvia,fcyydqq,t3_ejbp7i,1578089814.0,"Experiencing another life on earth is definitely a trip that happens. I didn't tell my best friend of 23 years what kind of trips can happen, and he got 2 life trips(separately). He was genuinely surprised when he came back so I interviewed him for like 3 hours and I can honestly say I'm convinced he experienced an entire life time with full free will exactly how it feels to be us here/now. 

First hour&a half of responses if you want them: Tire salesman with key bowl by the front door, wife named Susy a daughter Michelle and a son Frank. I remember my daughter walking down stairs with her nose in her phone chewing her gum wearing a belly shirt and short shorts I turn to my wife ""are you letting my daughter dress like this? Can you please talk to her and tell her to put some normal clothes on while I go to work now I don't have time for this"" Next door neighbor was watering his grass, white picket fence, saying something like hey neighbor. I hop into my silver Honda. 

I watched my daughter grow up and get a husband, now that was crazy. I had grand kids. Little Joey and Steve running around the house playing cowboys and Indians. The late nights you had to wake up because you hear knocking from the room next door, which is your daughter's room. And you go in there to find her boyfriend inside her closet. Oh man how quickly I chased him outta the house. I grabbed whatever I could, started swinging it at him saying get away from my daughter get outta my house right now. 

I remember that my wife ended up dieing first. We both grew to be quite old I must've been around 84 when I died. I remember being able to see my daughter and my son they must have been about 60. Them coming to see me in the hospital, that was a heart wrenching moment. As they were worried about me and crying over my bed. It seems the reason I was stuck on a respirator is because my lungs were giving out. 

Drank every once in a while, smoked a dubbie every once and a bit. Silver Honda with AAA insurance. I remember being with my wife as she was having my son first, she went through a 28 hour labor. He may have been 5 pounds 6 ounces, I used to wonder if he'd be a soccer player. He became a football player. You know it's crazy you take the hit, you're born, you go through school, preschool/grade school /high school(the vikings). I remember sitting inside my kindergarten class, the teacher hands us a bunch of M&Ms to teach us how to count a little bit and I ended up taking one of the M&Ms and sticking it up my nose. Learning row row row your boat, gently down the stream, merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream - - - if you see an alligator don't forget to scream! Learned London Bridge is falling down, and ring around the rosie we'd all actually fall down at the end cuz we're all holding hands and skipping in a circle. We sat in an open grass field for the giant parachute. Learned Yankee doodle dandie. I was a Christmas tree in my first play, my face painted red to be an ornament. There was a Christopher Columbus play. I remember having a school crush on a girl that played Pocahontas. Learned to play the recorder, and Christmas carols. I never got into video games. Favorite book was Moby Dick. Books I read: The secret window, the black crow, the dark omen, the red dress. Loved watching CHiPs, saw I dream of genie and M*A*S*H, I love Lucy all the classics like that. At some point I had a 15 inch black and white TV. Car never had a cd player, had a cassette player. Tried riding a motorcycle during his mid life crisis. Started working for 6.95 an hour as a tire salesman at 17 and had 20% commission some how. 

I met my wife in junior high, she was sitting in the front row I was in the back left corner. I was staring at her when the teacher asked me a question, I was too focused on her to know the question and all the other kids laughed at me but she gave me a caring look that made me smile. I had two best friends Joey and Mike, I knew a pervert named Darren. The one ""dream"" I remember was the kind of interlude between dieing there and coming back here. Slight fracture to my right leg falling down stairs, the tibia. Snowboarding quite young hairline fracture to my wrist. I remember smoking a pipe on my front porch in a rocking chair, my two best friends at my side reminiscing about old times. Went fishing on the ocean, caught a small shark once, it fought like hell. Felt like it was pulling the boat, I let it go. Caught tuna and went crabing. Loved the movie Forest Gump, loved lieutenant Dan.

I've also experienced more beauty worth trying to take pictures in my dreams now, and I don't recall ever feeling that way before Salvia."
Salvia,fcyn8lz,t1_fcwm2lf,1578083214.0,"I know a possible trip is ""watching a train with windows into days of my life for 2 months"". The brain connections are able to better form and condense from this kind of experience. I'd imagine given the right trips it'd have to help, in fact maybe the reason your memories get sorted better is to bring you back. There's so much information in a life trip, I wonder if people truely experience a real life sometimes. So your brain has a defense mechanism to pull you back."
Salvia,fcjf5yw,t3_ege64y,1577685383.0,"I think you're right, scrolling through my mind right now it does seem different than before I'd taken trips."
