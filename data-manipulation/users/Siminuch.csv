PokemonMasters,fdk19yq,t3_eltbb2,1578493564.0,Looks like you are new to the game. He should be quiet nice early while progressing through the beginning paired with 2 supports - Rosa and her gauge refill is a must.
PokemonMasters,fdjwei5,t1_fdj7qwf,1578489671.0,"There is somewhere a pinned post on Emma's discord in pokehelp or strategy meta channel (Game~something site like wiki) with breakpoints when Xatu will start tanking. Should make it easier for you, cant personally look for it right now."
CompetitiveTFT,fdenjqe,t1_fdel7ff,1578342769.0,"You always take base player damage (based on current stage of the game) whether its ghost or not. When you fight a player, base player damage is dealt by his Little Legend, when you fight a ghost, there is no enemy Little Legend so you get damaged as soon as you lose, it just looks like that dmg was dealt by your Little Legend. Dunno what you don't understand."
CompetitiveTFT,fdeiap4,t3_ekyjhn,1578339621.0,"Not a bug. You were fighting a ghost. In this case, when you lose, your Little Legend deals player dmg to itself instead of enemy's Little Legend which happens when you fight actaul player and you have time to run away to a corner to buy yourself that few seconds."

PokemonMasters,fdbxzck,t3_ekjvze,1578263586.0,"Yeah. Suggested it there when we got Torchic for our Player and it became very popular and useful pair. Now we even got Solgaleo and with current trend we might see even more Player-Pairs.

Would love to see rare, event stuff that comes back like Legendary events will, just to flex a bit and something to collect."

PokemonMasters,fcx5y0s,t1_fcx53pm,1578052599.0,Focus on getting Cynthia. Brendan is not necessary but helpful.
PokemonMasters,fcx4sz6,t3_ejdwxl,1578051231.0,"Depends on your 'playstyle' - what are your goals. To grind Courses, Supercourses on Auto you need some f2p pairs and Will, for Events Olivia and Brendan are a way to go for. Grinding EX Challenges for gear is kinda pointless and many of them require specific strat and 5\* units.

Getting Cynthia would help a lot in grinding current legendary event (maxed Cynthia on Auto is close to 100% winratio on VH for me) so if I were you I'd spend gems until I got one with 40,200 cap in mind (400 scout points). Maybe you gonna be lucky and get other 5\* while pulling her."
