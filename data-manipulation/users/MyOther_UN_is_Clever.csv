You should check out how much meddling the USA has done in foreign countries.

So it'd be cool for other countries to start assassinating our leaders because there have been 460,000 civilian deaths we are responsible for (some are Americans, even!) since the start of the Iraq and Afghanistan ""Police Actions""?

Btw, there's no such thing as an ""accurate drone strike.""  Drones are explosive delivery systems, not sniper rifles.   The current estimate is that the strike killed 25, and many of those were not people accompanying soleimani.

Shooting down a jet in your airspace isn't a retaliation, especially when you target the wrong country... a non-allied country the USA has been fucking over recently.  This is a colossal fuck-up by their military and a tragedy, but calling it a retaliation is blatantly deceptive.   It'd be like us ""getting back"" at Iran by shooting down a Jet from Brazil.

news,fdhm7tt,t1_fdgmnh4,1578425617.0,"Last year, I lived with a hardcore conspiracy nut for 4 months.  Guy had something like 180k followers on twitter.  There were times when I'd try and talk rationally with him about things.  Like:

>Hilary is in Guantanamo.   Or dead and that’s a clone. Or on Mars, tending to her child sex cult.

Like, there's a lot of bad things that she has done, objectively, that a lot of people just don't really know about.  So I'd point at those and try and discuss how those things are important.  That there really wasn't much need for these conspiracies, there's plenty of motivation for people to do these bad things, mostly just for money, power and thrills.

At the end of the day, I realized his conspiracy mentality was a combination of a lust for fantasy (a mars child sex cult is a lot more interesting than taking checks from special interest groups),  washing hands of responsibility (becoming truly active in politics is a lot of work,  trying to start a twitter uprising against the lizardman on your phone is easy), and a superiority complex (if you are ""woke"" then you're like wayy smarter than anyone else, right?)   The guy was utterly failed by the public school system in his rural red state, too.  He literally didn't know basic science facts like **heat rises** and **water evaporates**, despite being a highschool graduate.  Pretty much every day was an adventure with the guy, since I knew all kinds of things (like how to cook... hence the heat and water...).

He suddenly disappeared in the middle of the night, leaving behind most of his large possessions.  He would run these go-fund-me campaigns where he'd get like 10 grand from his loyal followers, so really didn't care much about the lost money.

A lot of house rules people add are, hilariously, socialist policies and/or heavy capitalist regulations.

Of course, as you said, adding these rules make the game last forever (which is great for an economy but terrible for finishing a game).

Reactive glue makes the plastic melt slightly, and fuses the pieces together.  You want to use a small amount, and a big advantage is that you won't end up with extra glue on the model.  Trying to use reactive glue as a filler will just create a sticky mess that either never dries, or gets crusty.

In OP's picture It kinda looks like hot-glue to me.  The hotter the gun, the thinner the glue gets.  You can also remove hot glue from a model by putting it in water of 140\*F or more.

Most modelers swear by ""greenstuff"" which is 2 part epoxy.  It's like a clay, and has quite awhile before it's too hard to work (although there's several kinds that harden faster/slower).   If you buy some, also buy a clay carving / pick set.  In general, your fingers are to big (and sticky) to work well.

My preferred hardening glue is Loctite GO2.  It's almost perfectly transparent, it's goopy (a gel), and it's a little rubbery which is really great for small contact areas (the female starting survivor on her toes) because things like super glue are brittle and are likely to ""pop"" apart if just a little force.
