Kobe was living like an anime protagonist who was always 3 steps ahead. That’s why he could let go of basketball one day and start on his next endeavor the next so readily. 

I just read Ramona’s article dedicated to him, describing him - Kobe was so human that it could be described as superhuman. Such a readiness to the next steps in life, always acting and preparing towards his next goal in life. He was living life like we all should and he tried to inspire this will to life in all of us. That will is what I know as mamba mentality.

Damn, day 3 and it is still so sad to think that he’s gone but funny enough, Kobe has me working out everyday again."

But now, I am just so thankful. Goddamn it."
