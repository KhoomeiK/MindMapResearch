coolguides,ffmojnp,t1_ffjr2fz,1580057312.0,"I've only donated plasma once and that happened to me too! I've donated blood a bunch of times. My veins are very small and 'rolling' (the nurses say) so they usually have to dig in my arm for a while before getting situated and then it takes me a while to fill the bag. But even that didn't bother me and I always felt fine (besides being bruised and sore where they went digging). 

Plasma donation also made me very cold. So maybe that had something to do with it? I always dress warm and take my time getting up. But the night/morning before, I am sure to eat well and always get a cookie and juice afterwards."

Uhmm.... anti-choice takes away rights, it doesn't give anything. It takes away a freedom, so she's saying that the government is free to impose what 'they' believe 'we' ought to do but are given no choice in the matter? 

Actually, that tracks. Sounds like freedom to me! (/s)"

You didnt do anything wrong, you pointed out the truth and made your mom feel bad for being a bad mom. Don't let her make you feel guilty because she doesn't know how to handle her own guilt.

HarleyDilly,ff1xf0k,t1_ff1hld7,1579488370.0,"That was my thought on it too. Asphyxiation, crushed included, is a common CoD from entering a chimney, isn't it? And chimneys get smaller as they go down. So maybe he thought he could sneak in that way and then got stuck, the more he struggled the more he slid down and essentially got crushed in there. It's tragic, for sure. But I would hope social media doesn't go crazy with conspiracy theories that could end up doing real harm to an innocent, grieving family/community."

clevercomebacks,ff02vo5,t1_fezyfmp,1579464594.0,"I don't find it funny at all, and there's really nothing political about it. The way I interpreted it is that Hillary couldn't satisfy her husband, so he (the 49 year old POTUS) was having a sexual relationship with a 22 year old intern. Not funny, clever, or thought provoking like any good political joke would be. It's just a sexist and offensive jab, focusing on disrespecting women."
