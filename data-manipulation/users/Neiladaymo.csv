worldnews,ffijcbm,t1_ffif8x8,1579975245.0,"Your immune system is pretty good at detecting intruders and dispatching white blood cells to destroy said intruders. Antibodies are also a good method your body uses as they are almost like a heat seeking missile in your system, dedicated to attacking very specific viruses/bacteria. This is how a vaccine works, exposing your immune system to a modified version of the bacterial or viral threat, allowing it to ""remember"" said attacker and prepare specialized antibodies to attack should the virus or bacteria come back. There's actually a protein called Cas9 in most human cells that will take the DNA from a virus and cut it with specialized molecular scissors, storing the DNA for another time. A virus as it divides will inject it's DNA (similar to a mosquito come to think of it) through the cell wall of it's victims cells. If a cell has previously stored this familiar DNA however it will much quicker on the uptake and ready it's antibodies MUCH faster. Immunology is a fascinating area of study. 

However, viruses are equally good at rapid proliferation. So really it comes down to a battle of who is going to succumb first, the virus or your immune system. This is why getting a good amount of sleep and drinking a lot of fluids is important when sick as your body needs to be strong for a well functioning immune system, and it is also why children and the elderly who have weaker immune systems are so vulnerable to these kinds of things. 

As for the remaining deactivated viruses (deactivated since they were never alive in the first place) that's basically just useless organic debris. It will be gobbled up most likely by white blood cells. The same thing happens when one of your own cells dies, the immune system will usually clean up the mess."

unpopularopinion,ffbep07,t1_ffb17rz,1579762069.0,"What you are saying also applies to the lower class and lower middle class of the United States lol. Most can barely make it by paycheck to paycheck, and God forbid tragedy strike be it medical or what not; you'll be bankrupted while still trying to live paycheck to paycheck. Oh, you found out you have cancer? Congrats on the terminal illness AND bankruptcy trying to cure it. A lack of socialized healthcare, and an economic incentive to capitalize everything is the cause of this. It's predatory, and no one keeps it in check like they should. Insulin is not a difficult thing to procure: we've literally been able to clone it since the 70s. A college student with a sufficent lab could make it, so why has the price gone from being a roughly 35$ product in 2001 to a roughly 275$ product in 2019 despite it being the exact same protein it was when we first learned to clone it near 50 years ago. Thats literally a 785% increase for no reason other than people capitalizing on desperate people's medical needs.

As for the poor living conditions, have you been to many inner-city areas in the United States? They aren't quite as bad as you describe here, but we also aren't nearly as grossly overpopulated as China. The conditions themselves however certainly still are quite dire for many areas while the cost of living rises and rises and rises. You essentially get to choose between job opportunity and spending outrageous amounts to live in smaller and smaller areas, as everywhere that has ample job opportunity is an overpopulated city or an excruciatingly high-priced living space in the suburbs on the outskirts of said city.

Also, I would add that it seems kind of unfair to try and associate China's terrible regime with a lack of capitalism. The Chinese government is a terrible regime because of its history, not its economics.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Also you reference Hong Kong with poor living conditions as an example of failures without capitalism, but Hong Kong is both democratic and capitalist."
