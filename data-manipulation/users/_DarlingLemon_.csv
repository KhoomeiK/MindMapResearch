In that scenario it is apples to oranges. When you just try breastfeeding it is usually because you want (I understand there can be pressure from outside) to. OP does not want a vaginal birth so there's no real good outcome from just trying."

You are the only one who has any say in this, as long as your doctor has given the ok, of course. Even your husband doesn't really have a say, though it's great that he supports your decision.

The difference between ""JUST TRY"" with breastfeeding and this is that if you try to nurse and it doesn't work out or you don't like it, you can immediately stop with absolutely no complications or problems.

If you just try to have a VBAC you either give birth vaginally, which you said you don't want, or you have an emergency C Section, which is more complicated and risky than a planned one. There's literally no good outcome for you if you, ""just try."" So tell your family to shove their unsolicited advice."

That said, it's best to discuss what you're into before hand. I'm pretty adventurous so my SO has permission to try things without specifically saying, ""Can I do XYZ?"" But they also know if I say any variation of stop, it's a no go and not to try it again unless I bring it up.
