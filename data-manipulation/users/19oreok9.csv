dogs,fdabfp3,t1_fda80s6,1578244113.0,"The bed worked out! Everything else I donated to the shelter. Thankfully, I didn't buy too much because I didn't know what toys ""the cat"" I got would like and I had an extra day (she was still recovering from her spay) before Cricket came home with me. She's very cat like except for her love of fetch! I never had a dog play actual fetch until I got her. It was a nice surprise ðŸ˜Š"
dogs,fd8fwfa,t1_fd7t0gb,1578217964.0,"Cricket's are the best! Also, I went to your post history looking for a picture- I have lived in ABQ NM most of my life if you need to pick my brain. I moved to Livermore, CA for work about a year and a half ago and then moved back due to health issues. The locals nickname is ""The land of Entrapment"" for NM but it is very transplant friendly"
dogs,fd65qwu,t3_ek4lrz,1578185907.0,I highly recommend doing a Wisdom breed DNA panel! I did it for both of my rescues and it was really fun! You can probably find a shelter that is selling them to give back too
dogs,fd6534h,t3_ek4rw0,1578185643.0,"When I got my Cricket I actually went out to my car after saying I'd think about it and then walked back in! I originally went to get an adult cat, but all they had were kittens and my Baby Girl! The general rule is two weeks. But all pups are different. The shelter I got Cricket from recommended keeping her leashed in the kitchen for the first 4 days and giving her up to 3 months to fully decompress. By the second day she was sleeping with me in my bed and has been there ever since! Congratulations on your adoption!"
dogs,f53ptv7,t1_f53mq5n,1571962542.0,Just make sure he has lots of water and talk to a clinic in the morning if you can't speak with anyone tonight
