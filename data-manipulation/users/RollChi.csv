Ya they’d probably have to be nerfed a bit if they decided to add them, but a good Pathfinder and a team with a Charge Rifle could probably take it down no problem."

WatchRedditDie,ff4ssvx,t1_ff4s6il,1579571591.0,"Did you even read my post or see what I’m trying to say? OP from JU screenshotted a post from WRD that is “supporting racism”.

That linked post had less than 5 upvotes at the time and multiple comments with 25-50+ upvotes calling out the OP (from the WRD post) for being an idiot.

The post you are replying to is LITERALLY showing how a racist/alt-right post didn’t gain traction in this sub and was quickly ignored until JUs OP decided to dig through WRDs trash and post it somewhere else"
WatchRedditDie,ff4sb81,t1_ff4rjzm,1579571248.0,"“This sub is trash now because it doesn’t fit my narrative to a T”

Most of the comments in here are just against violence based on someone’s opinion. No one here is supporting nazis, they’re just against the idea of assaulting someone based on their beliefs.

Like the saying goes:
“I might not agree with what you say, but I’ll fight til the death for your right to say it”

And before you quote me and act like I’m saying Redditors are “fighting til the death” with their upvotes or something, obviously we’re not. I’m just saying that’s the opinion of most people here."

Libertarian,fer9r1b,t3_eq91vz,1579351502.0,"“Would they consider driving a vehicle at a police officer, like we just saw in Wethersfield, Connecticut to be “armed”? 

Would they consider a 250 lb. man with mixed martial arts expertise going up against a 120 lb. female officer to be “armed” based on overwhelming and brute force?”

I mean... both of those situations are already considered armed... so ya

A+ way to end it"
