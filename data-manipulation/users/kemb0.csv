worldnews,ffl0ika,t1_ffktqdl,1580032549.0,"Another point I'm curious on is what figures are people using to calculate the mortality rate?

Eg let's say we have a virus with a 15% mortality rate where death occurs on day 5 of the infection.

On day 1 of an outbreak you have 50 cases but zero deaths. Reported Mortality rate = 0%

On day 3 you have 200 cases. 0 deaths. Reported mortality = 0%

On day 5 you have 7 deaths from that initial 50 5 days ago. But currently have 1000 cases. Reported mortality rate = 7/1000 = 0.7%

On day 8 you have 30 deaths but around 2500 cases = 1% reported mortality.

So clearly there the reported mortality rate is lagging way behind the true mortality rate of 15% and will not accurately reflect it until the infection is in decline?

We surely can not compare latest infection numbers with deaths to understand a viruses mortality rate. Yet that seems to be exactly what people are doing whilst claiming the virus is obviously being overplayed because ""look compare it to SARS' mortality rate of 15%.""

A lot of people here are trumpeting, ""only 3-4% mortality for coronavirus, so why you reddit people fearmongering?"" And indeed of the 2000 current reported cases there are 60 deaths, so 3% right? No I don't believe they is right is it?

But as highlighted above, that figure must be lagging the true mortality rate as the speed of infection accelerates and with death taking up to a week after infection to occur. We'd surely be better at saying how many infections were reported a week ago and compare current deaths to that?

So on Jan 20th China had confirmed 200 cases. So comparing to those infected on that date gives us a mortality of 58 / 200 or more than 25%!!

I'm sure it's not as simple as that but equally simply saying let's compare the most up to date infected numbers with those who've died is clearly going to be way off providing us with a picture of the real mortality rate.

Food for thought at least."
worldnews,ffkuh7g,t1_ffkqv2x,1580029114.0,"Also it's still early days surely to know the true mortality rate. There's a link on Reddit right now where some uni has a ""live"" map of infections. But of note is that map shows infections, deaths AND recoveries. It currently showed for Wuhan 50 deaths and 50 recoveries. That's kinda alarming. I suspect they're not getting all the recovery data maybe or most infections are still running their course but even so I'm a little uncomfortable with those stats.

It could just be ""reported"" recoveries though, of which I guess that's less newsworthy and likely omitted."
worldnews,ffksiys,t1_ffk0jl3,1580028105.0,"There was another Reddit post earlier from a university which linked to a map showing details on cases but interestingly also showed how many patients had fully recovered.

What stood out to me was that of the 50 odd deaths, it also only showed 50 recoveries. 

Obviously they may not be receiving all the data points on recoveries but a curious observation and considering how long it takes to recover from a flu, do we yet have an accurate picture on the actual mortality rate?"
worldnews,ffkreuy,t1_ffkp1ss,1580027561.0,"Yeah stupid Reddit guy must be wrong because someone posted one article from a doctor saying it's not as serious.

Come on, on one hand a big crowd on Reddit screams, ""you guys are dumb, look how you guys think you know everything after reading one article then totally overreact to it.""

Followed by

""Look at this one article that contradicts your viewpoint. There see I'm the smart Redditor now. You guys are all so stupid.""

Hypocritical?

My theory: 99% of redditors who claim redditors are stupid are actually just as stupid themselves.

These people don't really care about the truth, they just want to find any reason they can to say, ""Haw haw see me clever. Reddit stupid."""
videos,ffhsgdc,t1_ffhqa29,1579951549.0,Warning us. Crying about deaths in hospitals and corridors of dead bodies. Sure I bet the internet is full of doctors saying that about the common cold.
videos,ffhsecf,t1_ffhqj4r,1579951464.0,"Appreciate your reasoning but you're kinda saying ""we know China lies about stuff but you're being unreasonable not to trust them now.""

China has lied, is lying and will always lie. It's part of their governing methods. I'll accept that they're being more open than in the past but we're a long way from, ""Let's trust them unreservedly"".

If a country is busy committing a genocide and trying to lie about it, is it really that unreasonable to think they may be lying about other stuff?"
videos,ffhpoi4,t1_ffho4wy,1579947258.0,Isn't it chilling just to have a doctor risk going on social media to warn everyone knowing the Chinese government might destroy their life because of it? That must mean this is pretty bad for someone to take that very unusual step. When was the last time a doctor went on social media to warn people about the common cold?
pics,fffnkjy,t1_fffhqod,1579887801.0,"You know this is clearly helping and a good thing. But equally I'm under no obligation to respect them either. It's perfectly acceptable to distinguish the two outcomes of this:

1) The money these people pay is helping save animals: Cool. Good news.

2) These people killed a wild animal minding it's own business: What the Fuck? Fuck these guys. What kind of fucked up mentality do you have to have to do that. Hate these fucking selfish pricks. I wish the lion would have eaten them instead of dying at their cowardly hands.

There is no requirement to have to pick only one emotional response to any situation. So sure, I can feel good that the outcome is better overall and I can equally despise them. If I met them in a bar I'd happily head butt them both. Then I'd help them up and say, ""Good job for helping conserve the environment though....you cock suckers."""
videos,ffff7kk,t1_fff4yra,1579882655.0,"If 2-3% of the population of the planet died from this that'd be like 240 million people. Surely that can't be the standard death rate from flu as I'm sure that many people don't die every year on the planet from flu? If they did then the planet's population would be shrinking every year. 

Google tells me 600,000 people die from flu each year, so if that is 2-3% mortality that'd mean every year only around 24 million people on the planet get the flu each year. Or 0.3% of the planet's population.

So maybe it's this new disease's ability to spread more easily which is the concern rather than the mortality rate. So if standard flu only affects 0.3% of the population each year then maybe this has a potential to infect 20% or some such? That would make a huge difference to global mortality, seeing 48 million people die instead of 600,000.

I'm entirely speculating and am also unsure why this is such big news when I didn't realise so many people already die from flu each year!

I wonder also if the deaths from this new virus are directly caused by the virus, where as maybe most standard flu deaths are just contributing factors."

So what? They think everyone is the master of their own destiny, but they'll go wild and do everything they can to deny someone from becoming the master of their own destiny?

Call me crazy but I think that's fucked up. I'd happily swap out all those douchebags and have the hard working determined immigrants in their place."
AskReddit,ffeylh4,t1_ffeq829,1579870521.0,"Yeh sounds nuts right. But imagine a spec of dust that's travelling at 70 km/sec. That's insanely fast and at that speed you're looking at creating an insane burst of energy as the dust interacts with the earth's atmosphere. And that's why shooting stars are so fleeting. It easily burns up in a second but in that second its traveled 70km across the sky, creating the streak that you see.

And also that's why these more dramatic meteors like we see crashing on Russia put on a much more dramatic show. They might not be all that huge (@20m) but they've got a lot more mass to burn away so they're not gone in a second like those spec of dust meteors but instead can light up the entire sky as though it's daylight!"

As far as I can tell 99% of the time the responses are either well thought out or funny. This thread is mostly people giving valid thought out arguments and personal experiences and the only comments that refer to calling people monsters seem to be coming from people claiming that's what ""redditors"" are saying.

No hardly anyone on this thread is calling anyone a stupid kid mutilating monster so where are you getting this from? Unless there's like hundreds of these comments buried at the bottom of the thread but then if their opinions reflected Reddit as a whole then they'd have been upvoted to the top surely?

I'd still love to learn Kotlin but would be happy to offer a financial incentive for someone starting out if in return you could walk me through your coding process and share the code as it's being developed.  What I have in mind is not any kind of demanding app that requires perfection, so it ought to be a decent testing ground.

I've got a whole bunch of apps I want to develop so I'd also be keen on going through this process to help me learn the design side of things and how to get the ideas from my head in to a format that a developer can use.

gaming,ff2fq02,t1_ff2501h,1579504206.0,As a father who's been through the same thing I feel you. That online gaming is a lifeline that keeps your relationship alive. For me it was Minecraft. We would spend hours just coming up with challenges of our own and never completing them before we'd dream up some new challenge to work on.

Games,ff2372s,t1_ff02jj4,1579492561.0,"Even Google's core strength, it's search engine, is become frustrating to use. Search something up on my phone and often there'll be a whole bunch of effectively ad based results and maybe two legit search results amongst them.

I still find Gmail frustrating to use when I'm waiting for an email to arrive but nothing. If I then do a search of my emails it turns out it did arrive but somehow Gmail managed to hide it from me entirely. Why would I want that?

Google maps can be annoying too. They seem to assume everyone drives the same speed and base the ""time to arrival"" on that. If everything is about machine learning then why the hell can't Google maps figure out by now that I drive slower than most people on the motorway to save fuel so I'd really like to know that my 4 hour drive is actually going to be closer to 5. Or at least let me manually define my max driving speed.

I recently had a chance to interview for Google. I turned it down because I just don't feel like they're that great a company if they can't get the little things right.

science,ff091m2,t1_fez1ftq,1579466503.0,"Oh yeah I totally agree and made a similar comment elsewhere. You could tie yourself in knots if you go down a path of what ifs and as you say, you just need to say, ""look I don't feel guilty not fertilizing every ovary you'll ever have so an abortion is really just replacing one outcome with what was originally destined for it anyway.""

It's just for me I sometime's ponder this more deeply because we went through the process and did have the child so she's here now living. And it can be really weird looking at her and thinking, ""I could have made a simple choice and scrubbed you from ever being."" That does make me feel guilty sometimes.

But when that physical embodiment of that choice doesn't exist, it's far more easily forgotten. Which is how it should be and I'm totally fine with that."
science,ff07c82,t1_feymcij,1579465959.0,Thanks for the reply. You know it seems so many people have different takes on it and experiences that affect their thinking differently. I guess if one thing it shows the study this thread stems from doesn't really touch on the complexities surrounding abortion. I'm all for personal choice and if people want to seek advice or support then it could be there for them but not shoved down their throats.
science,ff053q8,t1_fez30gu,1579465324.0,"Thanks for the concern. I realise that maybe my wording might have been misleading. We didn't have the abortion. I guess what I was trying to say is that at the time I found making the decision with my partner to be quite emotionally challenging. Because it wasn't clear cut either way.

I can totally get that if you know one way or the other then I reckon it would be a much easier emotional choice. And I certainly don't and would never judge anyone else's call on that. 

And so for us, because it was a harder decision and because we decided not to, that means that today we have the living embodiment of the decision to remind us that there was a time we decided whether she was going to get to exist or not. There are days I look at her and feel kinda guilty that we even stopped for an instant to decide whether she should have had a chance to exist and so because of that, any time I read a thread on this topic I feel sadness for my daughter that we could have robbed her of her life.

That absolutely is not any kind of judgement on anyone else's choice though. Just my observation on myself.

So I think ultimately the most traumatic suffering might actually come from those that considered to but don't have the abortion, because then they live with a physical reminder of guilt that they even hesitated about it.

I'm not sure this really makes sense."
science,feyl6q4,t1_feyj9ln,1579447061.0,"Well sure but that's not really relevant to the point I was making which was that any kind of emotions will diminish over time. I wasn't comparing like-for-like, so much as using the death of a family member as an example of how emotions can diminish.

So ok, let's totally ignore anything I said about someone dying and just say,

""Emotions can diminish over time so you may feel less negatively about a previous decision many years later because the heightened emotions you felt at the time are less memorable to you."""
science,feyjpgx,t1_feyh90i,1579446428.0,Just want to add to my reply I just wrote. It would be interesting to see what percentage of people who've already had kids then went on to abort future pregnancies. I wonder if maybe one you've had your first child if it's harder to reconcile abort future ones because you have to face the reality of creating a life. Maybe there's nothing to this. Just a random musing.
science,feyj6ha,t1_feyh90i,1579446167.0,"Yeah you know writing some replies here about my own experience with the process I think I've come to the conclusion that not having an abortion actually results in more trauma than having it. Because we decided not to abort we now daily have to see and live with the very real evidence of what we might have aborted. I love my daughter and seeing her I often feel guilt that it ever even crossed my mind to abort her. That for me is quite a traumatic emotional thought process to go through.

Yet if we had had the abortion we'd be totally oblivious to what we'd missed out on and so likely feel no guilt.

The other point I mentioned elsewhere is it's kinda silly to dwell on having an abortion because you're effectively having an abortion every month that you don't conceive, yet no one gives a crap about those ovaries that miss out on their chances at life."
science,feyglda,t1_feyc1me,1579445240.0,"Yep totally agree. I imagine the underlying causes and external pressures can hugely impact on the long term emotional outcome. That process wasn't nearly as traumatic for us as I imagine some people faced. Family or religious pressures could exponentially increase the emotional effects of making that decision but for us it was entirely our decision. I still think about that decision a lot and it was still very emotionally challenging at the time but luckily it isn't so much of a scar as it could have been. Luckily I feel we made the right choice despite many hardships that came. I think what troubles me more now is that I love my daughter so much and I feel trauma and guilt that we might have chosen not to have her. Yet if we hadn't I'm sure by now it'd all be a long distant event in my memory. I'd have an entirely different family and be equally happy with those children. That troubles me the most, that one decision could have voided her entire existence and she'd not be in life today even though I would still have been just as happy yet oblivious to the child I could have had. I get quite emotional even thinking about it now.

Yet it's equally silly to think too deeply about that because every month you're missing out on bringing a child in to your life and we don't really dwell on that.

I'm totally fine with people having abortions but I'll never get over the emotional impact having to decide has had. Maybe actually choosing not to abort is more traumatic because you have to face the very real human reality of what you would have missed out on."
science,fey9i72,t1_fey45eq,1579442520.0,"Respectfully, I've been in a situation where aborition was an option and it still plays on my mind 13 years later. I appreciate that any kind of coercion or emotional manipulation adds unnecessarily to that and I'm against that but merely having to consider abortion by itself I can assure you is quite emotionally traumatic. We're talking about an event in your life where the outcome is going to have a profound life altering outcome not only on yourself but possibly on the person who may or may not be born out of your decision. That's not an easy process to go through and I still regularly think about what the outcome might have been if we'd chosen differently."
science,fexyxlh,t1_fexwe4e,1579438528.0,"I guess it kinda hits home more personally for me as I was in that exact boat. Considered an abortion as I was terrified of the responsibility and didn't think our relationship was strong enough to have a child. Went through with having the child anyway, the relationship wasn't strong enough after all but the responsibility issues melted away and I'm so incredibly happy we didn't have the abortion despite the relationship breaking down."
science,fexsktr,t1_fexi9t1,1579435487.0,Other people have made valid replies but to be honest I would have preferred to use different wording than traumatic but brain isn't kicking in so well today. Emotionally challenging or some such might be better.
science,fexsa4b,t1_fexmvhi,1579435350.0,Oh sure. I guess we should be more concerned with how the results of the study are portrayed than the study itself.
science,fexhmyn,t1_fex9gvl,1579431148.0,"Also wouldn't this study kinda basically just be proving the obvious, ""Our emotional feelings surrounding an emotionally traumatic event will diminish over time.""

Like if you asked people, ""Do you feel more upset now than you did five years ago when your wife/husband/child died?"" I'm sure most people are going to say that no, they feel less upset now. Because our emotions and memories naturally fade over time."
worldnews,fept315,t1_feprj1w,1579330326.0,"I wouldn't say it's obvious. The US can say, ""With great sacrifice we helped the world from threats of evil in two world wars.""

They can argue they championed democratic ideals when many parts of the world were ruled by dictators.

They can argue they championed a far freer economic model before the rest of the world.

They could point to the wording of the Constitution and it sounds like a worthy goal for all of humanity to aspire to.

I think it was possible to see many actions of the US and see a worthy cause that sought freedoms from oppression. I'm not saying everything was worthy as obviously shit like inequality for blacks was fucked up but at least the US seemed to be going in the right direction.

Now you can't even say that. Trump would undoubtedly bring back slavery if he thought he could get away with it. The US just seems to bomb anyone they can find. They oppress more than they free. They no longer champion a model of the free market but instead use a model of sanctions and tariffs to ensure US hedgemony. They court dictators rather than oppose them and they spit on their allies who supposedly share their same ideals.

worldnews,fepotfo,t1_fep9qyq,1579326390.0,"You know we could argue all week about this with you making a case for the clear benefits of an efficient Amazon and me quoting unhappy staff and work conditions but let's stop a moment and back away from all that and let me ask you this, which is the real questions we should be asking:

What is it we pursue as humans? What do we seek to get from life?

Because presumably that is the real value of happiness that should override all others? No point doing anything if it's not going to bring you happiness right? 

And ultimately shouldn't we as humans be making society work for us around those goals? 

Is having someone working in a warehouse on near minimal wage having his every move monitored taking humanity closer to our goal of happiness that humans seek?

Because if not then why are we doing it?

So what does Amazon achieve?

Convenience and cheaper products. Ok so let's say I'm happy to have that if I ignore the niggling conscience that someone worked in a sweatshop to make the product and some guy is miserable in a warehouse getting it to me.

It's making me happier so society is better right?

Well is it really? I mean let me tell you this, I'd happily forego all of that in a heart beat in exchange for a four day work week and a chance to spend more time with my child. But no I can't have that. It's not an option for me. Why not? Because society and businesses are all operated and geared towards squeezing maximum efficiency out of us, whilst the cost of living just happens to balance such that I need to work five days a week in order to survive.

So I'm not happier really about Amazon being able to get me a nice cheap something-or-other really quickly. Bezos isn't going to help me achieve a four day work week or let me spend more time with my loved ones.

And so I'm left wondering why can't we make society work towards what people would really want? And the answer is because there are too many people in power and their army of believers who are fixated on capitalism = efficiency = cheaper products and more profits = happiness.

But is that small amount of happiness really worth it for the sacrifices made? Not for me personally no. And I wonder how many people would gladly take that four day work week in exchange for a slightly less efficient society. I reckon most would. And if that's the case why aren't we doing it already?

Because what the current system really gives is power. Power to a small minority of people. And that makes them happy. It makes them happy at the expense of everyone else being able to obtain the happiness they seek. But they don't care about other people's happiness. Clearly not as who in their right mind would connect happiness with making people beg for toilet breaks or paying them barely enough to live off, let alone live happily.

It's a sad trait of humanity that some seek power and thrive off of abusing that power to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else's happiness. Once they were Pharos and kings. Today they are merely billionaires who dictate how happy the rest of us are allowed to be.

And it's sadder still that people blindly follow this ""business model of success"" when it doesn't really bring the kind of happiness most people really want.

And so that is why I won't champion King Bezos and his pursuit of increasing efficiency and profits. Because it'll not bring the kind of happiness to society that people really crave: free time to spend doing what you love with the people you love. It'll just bring small superficial happiness in terms of slightly cheaper products that might arrive 15 minutes quicker than they did before whilst giving Bezos all the power and happiness he could ever desire.

Yay!"
worldnews,fep5sfm,t1_fenu8p1,1579312765.0,"Great. So can we now have these things without me as a consumer contributing to a system that requires people to work at near minimum wage with brutal restrictive work conditions and for a company that avoids paying taxes which the state could otherwise use to help support those Amazon staff living on the bread line?

Or is the human sacrifice worth the progress? Is my being able to buy a cheap product manufactured in China and shipped half way around the world, thus contributing to climate change and destroying local manufacturing and businesses, really the kind of remarkable progress the planet and its people need?

What's the end goal here? What's the wet dream? A society where 99% of people are in poverty, the planet is destroyed, but the other 1% get to benefit from the most efficient consumerism the planet has ever seen?

Seriously, at what point do we actually consider the costs and not just the rewards?"

He understood everything. Everything was crystal clear to him. He spoke normally and had many heart warming things to say.

Also there are plenty of military personnel who don't like the term ""thank you for your service"" often because it's a simplistic way to avoid acknowledging that that soldier might have had to perform some morally distrubing action and he himself is troubled by it only to have someone thank him for it:

Being ordered to launch an attack on a village you know has women and children running about in? ""Thank you for your service""

Fired on an enemy unit only to later discover it was a friendly unit and you killed your compatriots? ""Thank you for your service.""

Some vets don't want to be reminded of what they did and blindly thanked for it.

Reasons go way beyond that though. If you look up the term ""thank you for your service"" online there are endless articles pointing out how it can be a problematic term to use with a vet and might result in a more aggresive response then you're expecting.

The southern half gained military backing from the US after attempts at reforming the two halves peacefully failed. This ultimately resulted in what is commonly known as the Vietnam War or the Second Indochina war.

This war was essentially the US and the Southern Vietnamese vs the Vietnamese North.

France was no longer a combatant in this second war, since this war was about which vietnamese side got to rule the country as a whole, and no longer about France ruling the country as a colony.

""Nazis have the right to freedom of speech. You need to stop telling them what to do.""

Which is funny because this sounds and awful lot like you wanting to curtail my freedom of speech. You're telling me I cant express my opinions now?

So a Nazi should be able to say what he wants about murdering Jews but somehow me telling him he's a wanker and saying I'd be happy if he died instead of the Jews isn't fair? But he should be free to spout whatever he wants but I can't? Why?

Can't you see that very fundamental flaw in your logic?

So really your reasoning is very abundantly transparent:

Nazis should be extended all the fredoms America offers.

Liberals should shut up and are not allowed to express those same freedoms.

Just admit it. You're a Nazi and are pissed that people just don't get you."

So if the nazis were to rise in power one day you would have to go against your stated belief of equality and stand against their ""right"" because if you didnt then you'd allow the Nazis to take away far more people's rights. That is their goal.

Do you agree? You have to accept this or you're blowing up your entire argument, so I ask you, at what point will you deny Nazis their ""equal rights?""

When they've got in to power? Nah that won't help, your actions will be far too late. Your inaction has directly allowed the Nazis to take away millions of people's rights. When they're formed a powerful party? Well Nazis went on to win from there in the 30s so that's likely too late too. Do we stop them forming a party all together? That's probably the safest option but then we're trampling on their freedoms right? Well isn't this a tough decision now isn't it? Where do we draw the line?

So you see some people prefer not to wait until we know whether something is going to be too late but instead say:

 ""if someone's whole world view is centred around denying other people their inalienable rights to equality and freedom, then you need to oppose it and deny them the ability to spread that message.""

We're not talking about denying Nazis all their freedom but merely denying them the ability to reach a position from which they can oppose freedom.

Consider it this way: If a criminal plans a crime but are caught before fulfilling the plan, they will still go to prison. They surrendered their right to freedom by following a path that was intended to run counter to the laws that uphold  freedom for all.

No one argues that the criminal didn't deserve to go to prison because we all acknowledge he intended to break the rule of the land. He intended to put himself above the equal rights of of others.

A Nazi's entire world view is based on putting themselves higher than the rights of others and would have to break the fundamental laws of the land to get there.

When one person claims one thing but the state tells us another, who do you go with?

In Germany there may have been rumours but the state would have muddied that with propaganda. For example, one well known incident is where some Jews were shipped off in the cattle trains you speak of but were then quartered in quite good conditions with a fair degree of freedom on arrival, much like a holiday camp. They were then encouraged to write back to other Jews in Germany and tell them that things weren't actually so bad after all. But it was all a deliberate ploy to deceive both the remaining Jews in Germany and spread misinformation amongst the non Jewish population.

Imagine you're defending Hitler and get to say, ""See you people saying Hitler is being evil against the Jews and now we can see these postcards from them saying everything is fine.""

It's so easy to just say, ""everyone would have known."" But that dismisses the very dedicated effective propaganda machine that the Nazis were operating to keep people in the dark.

The Nazis even encouraged children to tell the authorities if they overheard their parents making disparaging remarks against the Nazis and their parents would be sent to the concentration camp. There were Nazi spies everywhere in society: your workplace, bar, homes. 

The only way out was to show you regretted your previous opinions against the Nazis and were now completely dedicated to the Nazi cause.

I know you won't read this because people hate being shown counter evidence to their narrative so I'll leave this here for others to make up their minds. Here are three examples I found in as many minutes that touch on why Hitler's intentions weren't taken seriously at the time. I can find plenty more if you want to deny these.

https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/03/early-warnings-how-american-journalists-reported-the-rise-of-hitler/254146/

https://timeline.com/some-people-didnt-take-hitler-seriously-either-cd671577367b

There are many reason why Hitler either wasn't taken seriously or was not seen as a threat to world peace at the time that went along these trains of thought:

1) Surely Hitler wouldnt want another war. They lost the last and know as well as us how horrific war is.

2) Hitler is an unimpressive buffoon. We don't take his ramblings seriously.

3) Hitler surely wouldn't dare go against the might of France and Britain.

4) Hitler keeps saying his intentions are only to reclaim land they lost or are germanic so if we give him that it will shut him up.

5) Hitler keeps saying he wants peace with Europe and respects France and Britain's desires for peace. 

6) Hitler has signed an agreement saying he'll not take Europe in to war. Hooray war has been averted.

7) Hitler's government can't last. Too many german people stand against his ideals

8) How could Germany go to war when the German people can't possibly want another war. What would they even be fighting for?

9) Hitler's intentions aren't aggressive. He's just playing a clever political game. He keeps saying he wants to make Germany's economy stronger and war wouldn't do that. It would destroy their economy.

As I said before. Anyone thinking Hitler's actions were obvious has a biased opinion on history. These points above are all factors that come up in any thorough reading of the rise of Hitler. You think it's obvious because you have history books that tell you what happened. You didn't live through that period. Go read the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich which wqs written by someone that did experience it and it'll walk you through the process of why so many leaders across the world failed to act. People didn't want war and they were desperate to find reasons why there wouldnt be war. Hitler himself continuously publicly spoke about how he didnt want a war. Even in the days before his invasion of Poland Hitler spoke publically of his hope to find a peaceful solution.

He played the west for fools. They wanted to believe his talk of avoiding war and he took advantage of that to buy himself time to build up Germany's war machine."

So can you accept Russia's faults or is mother Russia perfect and always the innocent party?

Everyone else is to blame. Russia invades the Crimea: Ukraines fault. Russia invades Poland: Poland and Britain's fault. Russia invades Afghanistan: Americas fault. Russia starts a war on Ukraine's eastern borders: Ukraine's fault. Russia invaded Finland: Finland's fault.

YOU CAN'T ACCEPT BLAME.

Accept blame for Russia's faults and wrongdoings that the rest of the world accepts you are the guilty party for. Russia killed hundreds of thousands of Poles: Russia's fault. Russia invades ukraine: Russia's fault. Russia occupies Europe against the will of the people for forty years: Russia's fault.

Surely that can't be the standard death rate from flu as I'm sure that many people don't die every year on the planet from flu? If they did then the planet's population would be shrinking every year. 

Google tells me 600,000 people die from flu each year, so if that is 2-3% mortality that'd mean every year only around 24 million people on the planet get the flu each year. Or 0.3% of the planet's population.

So maybe it's this new disease's ability to spread more easily which is the concern rather than the mortality rate. So if standard flu only affects 0.3% of the population each year then maybe this has a potential to infect 20% or some such? That would make a huge difference to global mortality, seeing 48 million people die instead of 600,000.

I'm entirely speculating and am also unsure why this is such big news when I didn't realise so many people already die from flu each year!

It's just for me I sometime's ponder this more deeply because we went through the process and did have the child so she's here now living. And it can be really weird looking at her and thinking, ""I could have made a simple choice and scrubbed you from ever being."" That does make me feel guilty sometimes.

But when that physical embodiment of that choice doesn't exist, it's far more easily forgotten. Which is how it should be and I'm totally fine with that."

science,ff053q8,t1_fez30gu,1579465324.0,"Thanks for the concern. I realise that maybe my wording might have been misleading. We didn't have the abortion. I guess what I was trying to say is that at the time I found making the decision with my partner to be quite emotionally challenging. Because it wasn't clear cut either way.

I can totally get that if you know one way or the other then I reckon it would be a much easier emotional choice. And I certainly don't and would never judge anyone else's call on that. 

And so for us, because it was a harder decision and because we decided not to, that means that today we have the living embodiment of the decision to remind us that there was a time we decided whether she was going to get to exist or not. There are days I look at her and feel kinda guilty that we even stopped for an instant to decide whether she should have had a chance to exist and so because of that, any time I read a thread on this topic I feel sadness for my daughter that we could have robbed her of her life.

That absolutely is not any kind of judgement on anyone else's choice though. Just my observation on myself.

Because we decided not to abort we now daily have to see and live with the very real evidence of what we might have aborted. I love my daughter and seeing her I often feel guilt that it ever even crossed my mind to abort her. That for me is quite a traumatic emotional thought process to go through.

Yet if we had had the abortion we'd be totally oblivious to what we'd missed out on and so likely feel no guilt.

The other point I mentioned elsewhere is it's kinda silly to dwell on having an abortion because you're effectively having an abortion every month that you don't conceive, yet no one gives a crap about those ovaries that miss out on their chances at life."
science,feyglda,t1_feyc1me,1579445240.0,"Yep totally agree. I imagine the underlying causes and external pressures can hugely impact on the long term emotional outcome. That process wasn't nearly as traumatic for us as I imagine some people faced. Family or religious pressures could exponentially increase the emotional effects of making that decision but for us it was entirely our decision. I still think about that decision a lot and it was still very emotionally challenging at the time but luckily it isn't so much of a scar as it could have been. Luckily I feel we made the right choice despite many hardships that came. I think what troubles me more now is that I love my daughter so much and I feel trauma and guilt that we might have chosen not to have her. Yet if we hadn't I'm sure by now it'd all be a long distant event in my memory. I'd have an entirely different family and be equally happy with those children. That troubles me the most, that one decision could have voided her entire existence and she'd not be in life today even though I would still have been just as happy yet oblivious to the child I could have had. I get quite emotional even thinking about it now.

Yet it's equally silly to think too deeply about that because every month you're missing out on bringing a child in to your life and we don't really dwell on that.

I'm totally fine with people having abortions but I'll never get over the emotional impact having to decide has had. Maybe actually choosing not to abort is more traumatic because you have to face the very real human reality of what you would have missed out on."

Because society and businesses are all operated and geared towards squeezing maximum efficiency out of us, whilst the cost of living just happens to balance such that I need to work five days a week in order to survive.

So I'm not happier really about Amazon being able to get me a nice cheap something-or-other really quickly. Bezos isn't going to help me achieve a four day work week or let me spend more time with my loved ones.

And so I'm left wondering why can't we make society work towards what people would really want? And the answer is because there are too many people in power and their army of believers who are fixated on capitalism = efficiency = cheaper products and more profits = happiness.

But is that small amount of happiness really worth it for the sacrifices made? Not for me personally no. And I wonder how many people would gladly take that four day work week in exchange for a slightly less efficient society. I reckon most would. And if that's the case why aren't we doing it already?

Because what the current system really gives is power. Power to a small minority of people. And that makes them happy. It makes them happy at the expense of everyone else being able to obtain the happiness they seek. But they don't care about other people's happiness. Clearly not as who in their right mind would connect happiness with making people beg for toilet breaks or paying them barely enough to live off, let alone live happily.

It's a sad trait of humanity that some seek power and thrive off of abusing that power to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else's happiness. Once they were Pharos and kings. Today they are merely billionaires who dictate how happy the rest of us are allowed to be.

And it's sadder still that people blindly follow this ""business model of success"" when it doesn't really bring the kind of happiness most people really want.

And so that is why I won't champion King Bezos and his pursuit of increasing efficiency and profits. Because it'll not bring the kind of happiness to society that people really crave: free time to spend doing what you love with the people you love. It'll just bring small superficial happiness in terms of slightly cheaper products that might arrive 15 minutes quicker than they did before whilst giving Bezos all the power and happiness he could ever desire.

Yay!"

Also there are plenty of military personnel who don't like the term ""thank you for your service"" often because it's a simplistic way to avoid acknowledging that that soldier might have had to perform some morally distrubing action and he himself is troubled by it only to have someone thank him for it:

Being ordered to launch an attack on a village you know has women and children running about in? ""Thank you for your service""

Fired on an enemy unit only to later discover it was a friendly unit and you killed your compatriots? ""Thank you for your service.""

Some vets don't want to be reminded of what they did and blindly thanked for it.

Reasons go way beyond that though. If you look up the term ""thank you for your service"" online there are endless articles pointing out how it can be a problematic term to use with a vet and might result in a more aggresive response then you're expecting.

The southern half gained military backing from the US after attempts at reforming the two halves peacefully failed. This ultimately resulted in what is commonly known as the Vietnam War or the Second Indochina war.

A different war from the first Indochina war.

This war was essentially the US and the Southern Vietnamese vs the Vietnamese North.

France was no longer a combatant in this second war, since this war was about which vietnamese side got to rule the country as a whole, and no longer about France ruling the country as a colony.

Do you agree? You have to accept this or you're blowing up your entire argument, so I ask you, at what point will you deny Nazis their ""equal rights?""

When they've got in to power? Nah that won't help, your actions will be far too late. Your inaction has directly allowed the Nazis to take away millions of people's rights.

 ""if someone's whole world view is centred around denying other people their inalienable rights to equality and freedom, then you need to oppose it and deny them the ability to spread that message.""

We're not talking about denying Nazis all their freedom but merely denying them the ability to reach a position from which they can oppose freedom.

Consider it this way: If a criminal plans a crime but are caught before fulfilling the plan, they will still go to prison. They surrendered their right to freedom by following a path that was intended to run counter to the laws that uphold  freedom for all.

No one argues that the criminal didn't deserve to go to prison because we all acknowledge he intended to break the rule of the land. He intended to put himself above the equal rights of of others.

They were then encouraged to write back to other Jews in Germany and tell them that things weren't actually so bad after all. But it was all a deliberate ploy to deceive both the remaining Jews in Germany and spread misinformation amongst the non Jewish population.

Imagine you're defending Hitler and get to say, ""See you people saying Hitler is being evil against the Jews and now we can see these postcards from them saying everything is fine.""

And how do you defend against that which would seem like compelling evidence versus just rumours of evils?

It's so easy to just say, ""everyone would have known."" But that dismisses the very dedicated effective propaganda machine that the Nazis were operating to keep people in the dark. 

Again, I'm not defending the German population or stating no one knew. But when every aspect of the state and all news sources are controlled by the state, it's very easy to leave people doubting what they hear and rumours are impossible to verify."

My words are only to remind people that even if we see ourselves as innocents who wouldn't fall for what the German's did, it can happen again and it could happen anywhere. Where one ethnic group of people start blaming another, you've already planted seeds of ethnic or religious hatred that one day could grow to genocide. Sounds extreme? It did to many in Germany too.

Anyone who denies that or believes only the German's possessed this ability to cause such evil is thoroughly misleading themselves. Genocides have happened all across history and they will happen again, arguably they are right now in China.

It only takes the right amount of friction between ethnic or religious groups in order for hatred to turn in to evil action. And that can happen anywhere at any time.

My message would simply be this: learn from and judge the evil deeds of others but beware your own potential to hate or be misled to hate."

It was a country wide form of control and subversion of the population to get them to do their bidding. The Nazis even encouraged children to tell the authorities if they overheard their parents making disparaging remarks against the Nazis and their parents would be sent to the concentration camp. There were Nazi spies everywhere in society: your workplace, bar, homes. 

The only way out was to show you regretted your previous opinions against the Nazis and were now completely dedicated to the Nazi cause.

The Jews were, however, taken down a unique path of their own when it came to concentration camps and death camps. There was no way out for them."

Or harder, if I picked a random town 500 miles from you in another country, could you even tell me where that town's prison is? Then consider that that town had a new prison built a few months ago, 20 miles away from the town in some remote woods and every approach to that prison is guarded. If you're not even from that town, or country and you live 500 miles away, how could you possibly know what goes on there?

Do you know what even goes on inside your country's nearest secret military base? If a country's leaders what to keep something secret, they can.

Now I certainly believe many Germans were more guilty than they let on, but I think it's unreasonable to state they were all guilty or somehow all knew.

However I'll caveat it by saying everyone will have known the Jews were shipped out. No German can be innocent of ignorance to at least feeling like a gross injustice was occuring."

With the terrorism events of the 21st century, many people feel open anger towards Muslims in western countries. Traditional Western and Muslim cultures and values don't overlap well in many areas which only adds to the tensions and there seems little effort to address this. There have already been many hate crimes against Muslims just as there were against Jews befoe WW2. And with the populations of those Muslim minorities in those countries increasing, the stage is being set for some form of ethnic oppression or worse to occur. We could argue Trump had done more to take us down that path than any other politician of late but he's certainly not alone on this. 

We often look on 1930s and 40s Germans and say, ""how could they let this happen? They can't possibly claim ignorance or innocence.'

I feel like real democracy should be where every elected official has complete freedom to vote on every issue however they wish without coercion or repercussion from 'the party"". Otherwise what's the point in having all these senators/MPs etc if they're always told how to vote. It's pointless and just means the leader is effectively a dictator."

https://timeline.com/some-people-didnt-take-hitler-seriously-either-cd671577367b

There are many reason why Hitler either wasn't taken seriously or was not seen as a threat to world peace at the time that went along these trains of thought:

1) Surely Hitler wouldnt want another war. They lost the last and know as well as us how horrific war is.

2) Hitler is an unimpressive buffoon. We don't take his ramblings seriously.

3) Hitler surely wouldn't dare go against the might of France and Britain.

4) Hitler keeps saying his intentions are only to reclaim land they lost or are germanic so if we give him that it will shut him up.

5) Hitler keeps saying he wants peace with Europe and respects France and Britain's desires for peace. 

6) Hitler has signed an agreement saying he'll not take Europe in to war. Hooray war has been averted.

7) Hitler's government can't last. Too many german people stand against his ideals

8) How could Germany go to war when the German people can't possibly want another war. What would they even be fighting for?

9) Hitler's intentions aren't aggressive. He's just playing a clever political game. He keeps saying he wants to make Germany's economy stronger and war wouldn't do that. It would destroy their economy.

As I said before. Anyone thinking Hitler's actions were obvious has a biased opinion on history. These points above are all factors that come up in any thorough reading of the rise of Hitler. You think it's obvious because you have history books that tell you what happened. You didn't live through that period. Go read the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich which wqs written by someone that did experience it and it'll walk you through the process of why so many leaders across the world failed to act. People didn't want war and they were desperate to find reasons why there wouldnt be war. Hitler himself continuously publicly spoke about how he didnt want a war. Even in the days before his invasion of Poland Hitler spoke publically of his hope to find a peaceful solution.

He played the west for fools. They wanted to believe his talk of avoiding war and he took advantage of that to buy himself time to build up Germany's war machine."

Stalin occupied Eastern Europe illegally against the will of the people of those nations. But yeh, soz we don't have access to Stalin's mind to prove he planned this all along but the proof is in the pudding so to speak. Stalin did what the hearsay said he was planning.

Yeah you know what Britain has done a load of bad shit but here's the difference between me and you. I accept Britain's faults. Britain has many guilts. So can you accept Russia's faults or is mother Russia perfect and always the innocent party? It's not hard to do when you're not dripping with patriotism like Russians always show themselves to be online. So listen to yourself: deny deny deny. Russia makes no mistakes. Everyone else is to blame. Russia invades the Crimea: Ukraines fault. Russia invades Poland: Poland and Britain's fault. Russia invades Afghanistan: Americas fault. Russia starts a war on Ukraine's eastern borders: Ukraine's fault. Russia invaded Finland: Finland's fault.

YOU CAN'T ACCEPT BLAME.

There I put it in capitals for you. So let's see if you can prove you're not as blindly patriotic as you are showing yourself to be just as I can accept Britain's guilts. Accept blame for Russia's faults and wrongdoings that the rest of the world accepts you are the guilty party for. Russia killed hundreds of thousands of Poles: Russia's fault. Russia invades ukraine: Russia's fault. Russia occupies Europe against the will of the people for forty years: Russia's fault.

Come on then, can you do it? Or are you just going to revert to whataboutism again in order to cower away from daring to see Russia as the wrongdoer? If you can't do this then you're nothing but a coward. If you can then you're a friend."
worldnews,fcp0uj2,t1_fcoz1v6,1577847036.0,"I feel like you replied to my post without actually reading it. It's easy to speak from our high horse when we know what happened and why. But at the time they didn't know what path was unfolding by their events, Chamberlin was a fool in hindsight but at the time many in Britain were desperate to avoid yet another bloody futile war. And they had perfectly legitimate right to feel that way after millions had died at war only two decades earlier. I'm sure Chamberlin didn't want to be remembered as the guy that started WW2 so he tried a route of peace which at the time he had no specific reason to know that his actions were actually falling in to Hitler's hands. Remember Hitler was a crafty sod who framed his land grabs as, ""returning Germanic people back under control of Germany."" He gave Chamberlin reasons to believe that Hitler didn't actually want to take over all of Europe and Russia. Just return what they could argue was rightfully theirs. Chamberlin fell for it. He was stupid. But comparing that to Russia invading Poland and making out the two are equal evil wrongdoings is revisionist bullshit. Britain didn't murder Poles in cold blood. Britain drew a line after many mistakes and said if Hitler Invades Poland then it's war, and they followed through on that. Russia could have stated the same there and then and Germany would have been finished right at the start. But no, Russia didn't. Russia invaded Poland with Germany instead. Chamberlin has blood on his hands because he was a fool. Stalin has blood on his hands because he was a cold blooded calculating warmongering devil. Did Russia or Britain illegally occupy Eastern Europe after WW2 against the will of the people of those countries? That shows a country's true colours."

A lot of people seem to be commenting from their lofty beneficial perch called ""hindsight."" Yeah obviously we'd all go back in time and tell the main leaders of Europe to fuck Hitler up in 1933, not keep making mistakes that led to his rise.

But the leaders back then didn't have hindsight. They didn't know what the consequences of anything were going to be. But they did have a lot of internal pressures and a recent tragic global war that weigh heavily on their history."
worldnews,fcotkc5,t1_fco4an6,1577841174.0,However there are also whispers of evidence that Stalin planned to use the opportunity of war in Europe to expand westwards all along.

WTF,fcnp3fq,t1_fcn8oli,1577815747.0,"I'd liken it to this: the natural climate cycle of the planet is like a person jumping up and down. It keeps repeating naturally. The man keeps jumping up and down quite predictably.

Then we introduce man made accelerating of climate change. It would be like attaching a rocket under the man the next time he goes to jump and igniting it. He gets blasted off far faster than that normal jump he was making. We don't know how high he's going to go. We don't know how much fuel is in the rocket. And we don't know if he'll survive when he comes back down to Earth.

The moral is clear and simple. Yes there are natural cycles, and then there's the unknown rapid acceleration we're forcing on the planet. Just because the start of it follows the path of a natural cycle means nothing if instead of going 30mph in a 30mph street, you instead accelerate down it in a dragster pulling 10g.

All the scientists are saying, ""take off the rocket pack please."" Or ""please don't try to commute to work in a dragster"" But some dog-headed people think they're being the wise ones when they say, ""Shut up. I'm still following the same route to work aren't I so what can go wrong?"""
