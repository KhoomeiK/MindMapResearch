GlobalOffensive,ffi6obw,t1_ffi5ea7,1579966510.0,"Reading comprehension bud, I've been saying the whole time you need to go through third party shit for *crosshair info*, I only mentioned the console later. Clearly I'm not saying you need to look up how to enable the console. Good God.

How in the hell are you comparing a key component of the game like a crosshair to bonus content that is optional? And why would they put those in the game? They're literally marketing tools to bring you to those sites. Don't worry though, Valve makes it real easy to buy cases and keys.

Again, why would they not include it? Why are you so against a simple inclusion that would have ***zero*** effect on how *you* play. You could still use console codes. People still adjust mouse sens and key bindings in console, yet there's a menu for it. How has this affected you?"
SuicideWatch,ffi1996,t3_etq9iz,1579962043.0,"Same here, just turned 24 not long ago. Any reason why you feel it? I get this feeling of impending doom, and some sort of anxiety about literally anything in the future; or the present too, I guess. Just in general there's a nervous energy in me that puts me at odds with everyone around. Not trying to just talk about myself, but I want to know if you're the same."
GlobalOffensive,ffhwprw,t1_ffhskxa,1579957290.0,"It's not difficult, no, but tell me a game that has come out recently that requires you to figure out a key option of the game from some third party source. Imagine booting up a brand new game  and the mouse settings are hidden, the console turned off, and the game controls like shit. That's stupid design. Sure it's easy to fix, but why? Why do you need to fix it when apparently menu options are so much easier to create in panorama."
Documentaries,ffhh7sc,t1_fffnb03,1579935109.0,"Communism is the end goal, it makes sense but with the current technology of the world it's way out of reach. Marx thought there should be a dictatorship of the working class before there's communism, but somehow didn't realize that by making the working class the political class — get this — they just become the political elite. And the political elite will resent dissidents and the working class. Then it's just a regular dictatorship. Tankies to this day still believe in this, and so do shit heads at chapotraphouse. Just a bunch of kids that will follow anyone else's ideology without thinking about it for a second.

Communism is good, and Marx made some great observations, but he contradicted those observations either because of restlessness or because he hated the people that made good points based on his observations, like Bakunin. One of the observations he made was that with the advent of a new technology, the economic structures shift to a different mode of production. Tribal, asiatic, feudalism, capitalism, socialism, communism; each one is begotten by the next because of some technical advancement. He didn't know what this advancement would be, so for some reason he kept urging people that they needed to rise up immediately. Regardless of any technological advancement. I think the guy just wanted to be a part of a revolution, honestly.

So that's where we are today. He noted that the shifts of modes of production sort of happen naturally. People end up realizing they're being exploited and rise up to shift modes, like from feudalism to capitalism. Until we start looking at the problems that create communism, rather than prevent it, we will never achieve it on a worldly scale.

P. S. Fuck Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. They're murderous dictators that abused the ideology for their own personal gains."

Absolutely insane logic. It has nothing to do with skill in the game, it's simply preference, but it could help to know that it's an option. It's not 2004 anymore, a lot of people who play games don't have the time to do extracurricular work for one game.

movies,ffeaqjo,t1_ffd6dh2,1579841481.0,"The point your making doesn't need to be stated because it is also obvious. It doesn't have to be explicitly stated, especially since you're basing your assumption off of what he didn't say and saying ""This is what he said."" It's a non-sequitur and a straw man.

It's also not what he's talking about. He's talking about the chance to make decisions, men have made terrible decision after terrible decision and then turn around and say ""Women shouldn't decide anything because it will be terrible"". He isn't saying if women made decisions they would be morally righteous, he's saying they aren't given the chance to because the morally corrupt are making hypocritical statements. 

It's a subtext you're creating by splicing in others' opinions. If people are making the argument you're talking about, that's fine, but it's a straw man to say that's what he is saying."
GlobalOffensive,ffe16hg,t1_ffd04di,1579834032.0,"I just want there to be a tab in options for creating a crosshair instead of having to remember/find commands or use a third party site. It's so stupid to only show new players that there are 2 styles with 3 variations each when in actuality there are so many different crosshairs you can make. Just put sliders related to all the commands, they already have min/max values.

E: I'm saying that while I know there are ways to change your crosshair, there is no menu option for it. The menu, that's it. Imagine if there were no menu options to change your graphics settings, or your mouse sensitivity. Yeah you can use console codes, but have you launched a game in the past 5 years that had hidden options that could be crucial to your experience that had to be toggled in the console menu? And that's after you've figured out there is a console menu because you have to turn it on in the options menu. Asinine design."

I haven't read the second or third books, so maybe I don't have all the info, but just from Annihilation it's still ambiguous who is still alive or not. Whether it was her husband or not was just a hope she had, we're seeing it from the perspective of an unreliable narrator.
