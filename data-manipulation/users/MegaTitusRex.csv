AskReddit,ffo1e95,t3_euawj6,1580073145.0,"Female here. Lots of spit, first off. I start with wrapping my tongue around the head and sucking first there then swirl all the way down and holding it in my throat and letting it contract. Men seem to love that thick string of spit that comes from gagging on their cock (so I'm told). Don't neglect the balls, gentle caresses or a little squeezing. Be enthusiastic and look up into his eyes on occasion. If he's amiable, a prostate massage will make his eyes roll back."

AskReddit,fej8zet,t1_fej7lez,1579162086.0,"You can go a couple of ways. You can do a shotgun and most likely all an intruder needs to hear is the sound of it and they will back off or leave. If not, some buckshot with make them (and your walls) holey and they'll stop. My friend's personal favorite is an AR if someone breaks in. His argument is that the bullets will either stop in the person or the wall behind them and not go through the wall and into your neighbor's house. Personally, I keep a .40 in the bedroom, next to the bed. I feel very safe. Pros, all it takes is 1 shot and they're down making a mess on the floor and probably aren't getting back up. Cons, you're deaf after shooting it so, if you miss, your visuals had better be good."
AskReddit,fej6fyh,t3_epfjje,1579158825.0,"I've had a few painful problems from bulging discs in my spine to hernias to broken bones. I have to say though, having an ovarian cyst rupture put that pain to shame. I was literally on the floor, writhing in agony, unable to communicate what was going on. My husband carried me out to the car and took me to the hospital. It took strong drugs in multiple doses in order to just tame the pain enough to think straight. And there's nothing you can do for it. You can use a hot water bottle on your abdomen is what I was told, ott it's just waiting it out."

crochet,fdmoca0,t1_fdmfj98,1578557882.0,"Okay, small rant on this yarn. This is Mary Maxim Prisim yarn in Autumn Mist. I bought a kit that included this yarn. The problem is, the yarn width varies quite a bit. It will go from thick to ultra thin as you work with it. Because of this, I could not make the pattern from the kit. I had 10 skiens so I decided to just double it up and used a pattern I know by heart. It looks gorgeous and I love how the colors have come out."
AskReddit,fdlr12k,t3_em0tyk,1578530440.0,"Our neighbor took his wife and child hostage. It seems that there was a nasty divorce going on. She'd had a restraining order put out on him and he was not allowed at the house. One morning he shows up with a gun saying he's going to kill them. Somehow the police were notified. Evidently the guy had an arsenal in his house. We were woken up by police at the door telling us to stay indoors and keep them locked. They searched our backyard (part of the fence was down from a tornado a week before) then set up their base of operations in the backyard of a neighbor a couple doors down. Police arrived all day, parking in front of the house and filling the cul-de-sac. They had people in body armor with shields. They had K9 units. A ton of assault rifles. We were locked in the house all day, my husband couldn't leave for work, other people couldn't get back to their homes. They finally went in to get him around 6pm. When the police came to tell us we could leave the house, we asked if everyone went okay. He said the family is okay but the guy didn't surrender and didn't come quietly but wouldn't say any more. About a week later the house went up for sale. I have no idea what happened beyond that but he was a crazy neighbor."

I asked where she lived (about 2hr drive, in another state), asked if I could get her a cab or Uber, but she didn't want to leave her car in town. At this point she was dispairing. I told her to get in her car and follow me and I would get her home. We drove at 50mph for the whole way, but that's okay. I got her home safe and I'll never forget the look of relief on her face."
