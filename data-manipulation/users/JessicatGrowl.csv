GetMotivated,feta45k,t1_fesfty6,1579373203.0,"I’ll be finishing my bachelors in social work when I’m 35, with plans to go for another year for my masters in clinical work. I did worry two years ago (when I started school) about my age when I finish, but I decided the urge to not work where I do now for the rest of my life far outweighs those worries. 

A woman I used to work with told me that since I’d been at this job for 8 years, I may as well stay forever. 😳

No thanks. 

My current job rhymes with All Fart."

You know, unless you’re going into Criminal Justice. There are fields there where you have to be under a certain age. I’m almost in my mid 30s and looked it up a couple years ago."

pettyrevenge,fer619x,t3_eqbpy1,1579350307.0,"There’s a woman at work whose birth name is Mary, but her badge says Marcy, because it’s what she prefers to be called. Her manager insists on calling her Mary, and flat out ignores or laughs at anyone who tries to correct him. It takes a special kind of asshole to care so little. He thinks it’s a joke but it legitimately bothers her. 

Kudos for sticking up for your coworker. It pisses me off when someone attempts to change someone’s name to make it easier for themselves, like they’re the only one that matters."
Wigs,fepg8ea,t3_enukk9,1579319719.0,It looks so good on you! I love that length personally more than the longer ones. Maybe because my actual hair is around there.
Wigs,fepfxr7,t3_epukho,1579319508.0,This looks like the one I got today. I love it! Haven’t taken it off in a while. Got me wanting to look into more wigs of about the same length.
Wigs,fepefv4,t1_feowmdg,1579318469.0,I was just trying to remember this because my mom was thinking one of her wigs is way too shiny. Thank you!
Wigs,fepecuk,t3_eq99i2,1579318411.0,I love it! I’m currently looking into shorter than shoulder length wigs since I got my first one today (courtesy of my mom) and I’m loving the shorter ones so much.
entitledparents,fep2j6x,t3_eq04k5,1579310692.0,"When I was pregnant, there was a woman I worked with who would like to touch my stomach. I told her not to (I hate being touched by random people) and she had the audacity to tell me that since I was pregnant, my stomach was public property. So I told her that if she touched me again, she’d be pulling back some broken fingers. 

Now, when I was pregnant, I’m told I was really mean. My brother was scared to be around me for a while. So if I hadn’t been pregnant, I probably wouldn’t have said what I did to her. But it was summer, I was huge and hot. I had no patience. 

I expected to get in trouble for saying that. But management never said anything to me, and she never spoke to me again. 

Don’t touch anyone without permission!"
TooAfraidToAsk,felb1fn,t1_fel9xo6,1579217986.0,Ugh I hated that. So gross. So forced. So bad.

AmItheAsshole,fced780,t1_fcd7mbq,1577619367.0,Oh yes. I can see that. I guess I just didn’t let myself get close enough to see it. Their face and body put me off plenty to keep me away.

AmItheAsshole,fccqzkv,t1_fcbhwbb,1577601603.0,"My cousin makes them. We went to her house before Christmas to give some gifts to her kids and she had a couple that she or her kids would walk around with like they’re actual babies and they’re even creepier looking in real life. Her husband even freaked out because he accidentally touched ones hand and said it had nails, which is apparently the weird part to him. Not that they look dead. Just nails. 

There’s a person on reddit somewhere that brings one to his grandma and it makes her feel good. That’s a totally different thing. No one should spring these things on unsuspecting people. 

NTA btw."

myfavoritemurder,fcbv8tk,t1_fcbuorm,1577591354.0,"They talk pretty thoroughly about the episode so I feel like you don’t even need to watch the episode to know what’s happening. I haven’t seen much of the original series, or Criminal Intent, but I know what’s going on either way. Most of the episodes are discussing the episode. The true crime is pretty much the last 10-15 mins."
myfavoritemurder,fcbs10z,t1_fcbpg6o,1577590327.0,"It’s so obvious sometimes what some of the episodes are based off of, but others I’ve listened to so far have shocked me with cases I’ve never heard of."
walmart,fcbhz9l,t3_egutjv,1577587095.0,"This reminds me of when I was over domestics. I was passing by the curtains and a woman needed help. Sure. I’m helpful. 

She says she has a 90 inch wide patio door that she wants a curtain for. The largest we had was around 60 inches wide, so I suggest that she purchase two of those. It would equal more than the 90 inches and would definitely cover from one side to the other with no gaps. She agrees, picks a color, and I hand her the packages; she then looks at the package. 

“This is 60 inches. I need 90 inches.”

Yes, ma’am. That’s why I suggested that you purchase two of these curtains. 

“But I need a curtain that’s 90 inches.”

Yes, ma’am. We don’t sell any that wide. But if you get these two, it’ll be 120 inches. 

“But I need 90 inches. This is only 60.”

*

After this happened several more times, I’ve reached the point where I have no idea how to say what I’d been saying in another way. I’ve given her both of the curtains. She sees there are two curtains that are 60 inches wide each. The person with her, who has been quietly standing by, finally took pity on me and told her the exact same thing I’ve told her, but this time it connected. 

This is why I think customers just do not hear a word we say."

Some guy tried to steal some stuff at the store I work at, pulled a knife when confronted, bolted out the door and hid under a car in the parking lot, then dropped his knife when he took off for a very small wooded area where he was quickly apprehended.
