ThatLookedExpensive,ffgrni3,t1_ffftw02,1579913314.0,Will you use your law degree to do something with prostitution as well?
ThatLookedExpensive,ffgrkzs,t1_ffftohh,1579913262.0,That's awesome. I'm all for legalized and regulated prostitution (obviously off the streets) buy I love your videos as well. Is your problem prostitution as a whole or simply the way they go about it in your area?

Would you say your midget cat is as agile as a standard healthy house cat?

Would you cat have any trouble jumping from the floor up to a kitchen counter?"
aww,fdpm9fs,t1_fdpjroa,1578632621.0,"So your argument is that your munchkin cat is healthier and more agile than a fat lazy cat?.......congratulations?

But the fact of the matter is these cats were specifically bred to have short legs and because of that they are significantly less agile than a regular house cat. For fuck sake I'm sure they even have trouble scratching they're own ears compared to a regular cat. This is gross and wrong in the same way that pugs with faces so smushed they can't breath is gross and wrong."
