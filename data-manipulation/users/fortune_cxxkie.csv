sex,fgk5onc,t3_eyo2na,1580858030.0,He basically said he's ashamed of your looks. What a jerkoff. Why would you stay with someone who insults you?? Dump him and find someone who thinks you're the hottest shit out there!
WTF,fg5vv6u,t3_ex0n7u,1580541033.0,My baby nephew (1 yr old) has this and they just recently put him into a back brace/cast for about a year and then his spine should be straightened out and fine! Make sure to get multiple opinions before surgery!!
relationships,fg5t5g0,t3_ewwzt1,1580537927.0,"What you did before he was in the picture is not of his concern. He can't punish you for your life before him. And also, his excuse of being intimidated by you is bullshit. I dated men like this both younger and older than me and it's all just a bullshit way of trying to control you and demean and lower you below them so they can keep you in line. This is called an abusive relationship. You need to get out of there. I wish I had done th same before staying in some horrible relationships. One guy who did the same thing to me as your bf is doing ended up stalking and terrorizing me for a few years after I dumped him. Run."
AskReddit,ffuvaqx,t1_fftmwn5,1580250012.0,"I know that if I lost my two cars, I would cry harder and feel more pain than even when I lost my father. I absolutely loved my dad, but my cats are like my children and I feel like I am responsible for them, so I know their loss would be a much harder pill to swallow."
AskReddit,ffuv04b,t1_fftpt4i,1580249854.0,"My ex did the same thing to me while I was 1) almost dying from pneumonia as well, 2) my dad passed away as well during that time. It was a horrible time period for me, but looking back I am so grateful that ended because someone that terrible and unsupportive would make the worst partner in the long run. I have now found a way better person."
ChoosingBeggars,fff4veu,t1_ffehsrv,1579875756.0,Oh I know. I wasn't catching that kid haha
ChoosingBeggars,ffa61gd,t3_ese45f,1579728577.0,"When I lived in Rome they used to stand inside the entrance to the grocery store (this grocery store has steps there go down inside it) and practically throw their baby at me. It really pissed me off because the baby was real and one time almost fell on the ground!! I stopped being polite or giving my change after that and just had to start being rude, which killed me!"
birthcontrol,ff981vt,t3_es9j2r,1579706999.0,"Judging from this post and your past ones, if you're mental state/anxiety/OCD/whatever is this bad, you should not be having sex...."
