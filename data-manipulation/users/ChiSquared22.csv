samharris,fff4min,t1_ffd4frc,1579875573.0,"> There's also the fact that he literally used his charity money to fund it and pay for equipment.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but it seems like you're implying this is unethical/against his charities wishes. He's exactly what project reason says about itself on it's website

""Project Reason is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation devoted to spreading scientific knowledge and secular values in society. The project will draw on the talents of prominent and creative thinkers from a wide range of disciplines—science, law, literature, entertainment, information technology, etc.—to encourage critical thinking and wise public policy. It will convene conferences, produce films, **sponsor scientific research** and opinion polls, award grants to other non-profit organizations, and offer material support to religious dissidents and public intellectuals—with the purpose of eroding the influence of dogmatism, superstition and bigotry in the world.""

I'm assuming you don't believe it's unethical, so I'll move on

> My argument is that given that academically he's a very weak candidate, there needs to be some extra factor that swayed the decision board. I think self funding your study seems like a good probable explanation.

Sure, it's certainly helpful that he was paying his own way, but while were using speculation, it's also probable he was a strong candidate in ways we are not aware of e.g. LoRs, personal statement, maybe they were particularly interested in his idea for thesis/dissertation. From reading the OP, it appears he secured several federal grants as well, showing there is clearly some interest in what he was doing.

More intellectual dishonesty. You're just exhausting to deal with.

Jeffersons 2nd and 3rd draft of the Virginia Constitution: ""No man shall ever be debarred the use of arms within his own lands or tenements""  

Aka, some regulation

Washington: “A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies.” 

Here we have a much more literal interpretation of militia; George want's a damn plan and uniforms before uninfringed arm-bearing.

>If the constitution would’ve said “everyone has the right to cut their hair when they want and how they want” then it doesn’t matter what “experts” are arguing about and the fact that they are arguing about it doesn’t mean it’s not straightforward

This might be the worst analogy ever. Seriously. I'm impressed with how idiotic you're willing to make yourself look in this disagreement.

A better analogy would be if the Constitution said ""well regulated barbershops, being necessary to the  hygiene of the state, the right of the people to get haircuts, shall not be infringed""

In this case, it's clear that the government would be allowed to create and enforce regulations on barbershops. These regulations could ban certain products because they are toxic/dangerous in someway, and the banning of those products might make certain haircuts unobtainable.

Not only that, but someone getting their hair cut outside of a barbershop would not qualify for this protection. The prefatory clause states well regulated barbershop, not Uncle Joe's dirty scissor emporium. The government would be allowed to prevent people from getting haircuts at Joe's since it is not a well-regulated barbershop.

Here's a very simple breakdown of my points and if you swing and miss again, I'll be sure not to engage with you further.

- The text of the 2nd amendment is not straightforward. In particular, it's unclear what a ""well-regulated militia"" truly is.

- Many lawyers and judges have vastly different interpretations of it. 

- If constitutional experts have century-long disagreements about a text, we shouldn't pretend it's straightforward. That would be disingenuous."

You're certainly free to interpret it the way the court currently does, but please don't pretend, when people engage with you in good faith, to just not understand the argument their making. 

You think regulation-free gun ownership is a good thing. That's cool. Please believe what you believe.

Well this is where we disagree then. Cocaine is one of the most addictive drugs and can kill you in one use. Video games are less addictive and can breed a lot of other creative expression (depending on a lot of different factors, of course). So yeah, i think a much better argument is to simply say pleasure isn't always good, so you should question spending all your time on one pleasure-seeking behavior.

>Why do you think the substitution was ineffective? Because other times substitution can be ineffective? That's not relevant.

First of all, when discussing whether it's a good methodology (the topic i posed in my first comment and reiterated later) then yes, its completely relevant.

Anyway, it's ineffective because consuming media and doing deadly drugs aren't all that similar. The main similarity is that both the original commenter and drug addict both A) do the activity a lot and B) derive pleasure from the activity. That's it.  It's a lot more accurate to substitute video game consumption to other forms of media/game consumption, like movies, sports, puzzles, etc.  except that doesn't have the same psuedo-woke reddit interpretation as drugs.

Your ""is vs. can be"" distinction is very unconvincing. A system becomes methodology because it consistently is shown to work, or at least get things going in the right direction. If a methodology delivers good results half the time and completely wrong results half the time, it wouldn't be used as a methodology. This is why professionals don't diagnose people with addictions by saying ""well, replace X with Meth and now you sound crazy!"".

Substitution is a bad methodology because it can be used in a ton of different scenarios but it rarely gives reliable results. Any somewhat negative activity can be compared to drug addiction in the original example. Maybe it's best to judge things individually on their merrits instead....

The pleasure for pleasures sake argument doesn't hold because there are plenty of activities people do for pleasures sake that are respected very differently. This is why i mentioned arts. Someone who reads solely for pleasures sake will be criticized less than someone who plays video games. This is precisely why substitution is a poor methodology: the details of the activity matter. Someone obsessed with books is a bookworm, someone ibssessed eith video games is a nerd, someone obsessed and with cocaine is a drug addict. These are different.

Even the video game itself matters. In grade school, my teachers were okay with me playing math games on the computer, but they wouldn't let us play halo. (If only substituting ""math games"" for ""halo"" worked on my 4th grade teacher!)

>Your point that the substitution game is sometimes dumb, does not mean it isn’t sometimes useful to identify patterns of behavior and/or language.

Sure, however, it seems better, almost always, to just evaluate something on it's merits. Playing a cutesy game of ""look, the sentence still works when you put in X, and X is bad"" is not a solid foundation for evaluating behavior."
gaming,ff698jk,t1_ff68uwu,1579622105.0,"My point was that just substituting the main word for a different word to prove a point is stupid. Replacing video games with crack is stupid. Literally any activity can be filled in with video games and would make the sentence sound completely different. We could replace it with kicking puppies, studying philosophy, etc. To meet your demands, reading seems like it would work, since it's seen as ""good"" but some people think it's a waste of time, you shouldn't neglect your family to read more, etc.

>Don't neglect your family to spend time with your family???

>what part of this ""works perfectly"" as you say?

Why are you intentionally being dense? 

I'm simply saying that you could replace video games with a ""good"" hobby and suddenly he goes from addict to dedicated academic. Pick kicking puppies, now he's an animal abuser. Pick painting and now he's Picasso. 

Our value judgment about people should be on the merits of what they say, not whether or not we can substitute a drug for the activity to see if it makes sense.

I picked family because it's a ""neutral good"" way to spend time. Yes, he mentions family later. Great reading skills dude. If you genuinely can't follow the main point idk what to tell you."
