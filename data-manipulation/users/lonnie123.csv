Im not saying your wrong, but my opinion is that they are too entrenched in their current ecosystems to really shake things up to any major degree, combined with the lack of ability due to battery constraints.

The issue here is that they just cannot do that. Its all about the batteries, and unless they are hiding them in an undisclosed location somewhere, they just dont exist for ""mas numbers"" to drop. Its was just revealed yesterday that mercedes had to cut back production numbers in half because of battery shortage.
