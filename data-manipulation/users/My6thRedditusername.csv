blacksmithing,ffk1f84,t1_ffjx1en,1580012867.0,"I have a (homemade) venturi burner....I was actually curing a new layer of satanite and bubble alumina around the front and back and giving it a second burn (i always do 3 after letting it dry out for 12+ hours..15 minutes at around 10psi, cool, 15 minutes at ~15psi, cool, then 15 minutes at full blast (20psi)

If i go down to 5psi it will sputter and the flame will go out. but i usually only go full blast while heating up to ambient temperature (it gets to about 2,300 in 8 or 9 minutes....the highest ive gotten.according to this pyrometer at least is about 2,425)

then ill lower the psi down to 10-15psi and bring the temp down to 1,700 - 2,000ish or so for forging


so 10 minutes to heat up....and i think i've been averaging about 10-12 hours or so per 5gal (20lb) propane tank

i will run it full blast if i'm trying to forge weld...something i haven't quite gotten the hang of yet... but the bubble alumina and kiln shelf protect the interior from flux damage (it goes through kaowool like hot water through cotton candy) 


this molten steel issue is not something i anticipated but luckily i dont see any major damage i cant patch up quick...live and learn lol


fyi: i have a kiln shelf floor, the forge is insulated with 2inches of kaowool, covered in satanite, covered in itc-100, with bubble alumina along the side and filling in cracks/gaps between the floor and the doors....also the front and back ports are on hinges to control oxygen/retain and reflect the heat and keep it contained in the forge


if you are having problems with heat i cannt reccommend the satanite/itc-100 combo (and bubble alumina with the kiln shelf floor...but that starts to get a little pricey)


but the difference between before and after the satanite/itc-100 applications were like night and day.

i think i went from 25-35 minutes to get it up to heat (~2,000 degrees)


now it takes about 7 minutes to get up to 2,200 degrees easy. investment in the itc-100 will save you a ton on propane.

feel free to ask me any questions i'm happy to help if i can my friend"
massachusetts,ffjomxg,t1_ffjn9je,1580003107.0,"> Are you suggesting that FPTP is a superior system because it enables (and implicitly encourages) spoiler candidates?

it's one of many things on a long list of issues i see with it that i am suggesting.

and keep in mind i have voted 3rd party every year since i voted for obama back in 2008.

you think that chinese-owned cuck justin amash is making a serious run for president? ranked voting is going to make him nothing more than a spoiler vote to swing states that trump won in 2016 blue. he has no chance. that's the definition of spoiler vote. one owned by china representing chinese interests none the less.

promotes racially charged voting habits too..


this is not a way to promote a 3 party system....by giving all the third party candidates's votes away to the second place finisher.... that's retarded


i am honestly open to you changing my mind by the way... youre doing a very poor job of convincing me so far though.


>No, that's an example of RCV succeeding where FPTP would have failed

ps: let me guess. you do not vote republican or third party. ever. 

am i close?"
massachusetts,ffjkjce,t1_ffjhaa1,1580000327.0,"> You can see a small example of this utter failure in FPTP voting in Florida during the first Bush election. Even though a majority of the state supported a left wing candidate, Al Gore

thats not exactly how that happened... remember the hanging chads and citizens's united (and scotus ruling the winner using the 14th amendment over-ruling the state's laws etc)

but anyway... 


strawan by the way. but i'll play..


>an anyone give an example where ranked choice voting fails, but FPTP works? If no one can,


I can.

here's an example of it failing. the only state who uses it...so far... (maine) used the system to steal a house seat from the real republican winner in 2018 and flip the seat democrat, despite him having less votes in what is considered an important swing state for presidential elections.


Democrat Jared Golden the winner of the election on November 15, despite the fact that Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R-ME-02) received 2,632 more votes than Golden on election day, a consequence of the state’s implementation of a controversial “rank voting” system."
massachusetts,ffjelfp,t1_ffje4k6,1579996627.0,">  I can name countless examples where FPTP voting fails and ranked choice doesn't, so surely you can name one example where FPTP voting beats our ranked choice.

Please do. I'm not dead set in my stance here. Change my mind. 

>so surely you can name one example where FPTP voting beats our ranked choice.

nope. I can't....just seems like common sense logic to me. as far as I know it's just maine and a handful of cities scattered across the country that use it.. and I don't live in one of them. please correct me if i am wrong about that."
massachusetts,ffjdo7f,t1_ffic01b,1579996085.0,"agree with you 100% on 2, 3 and 4


disagree on 1 though. 

people won't actually vote in order of preference, they will vote in the way that strategically helps their candidate the most.

Voting will just become a game, especially since we have a two party system.
we have disturbing low voter turnout in almost all elections.

We also have many people who vote, but are not informed on all of the candidates and vote for their party no matter what.

This type of system does nothing to solve either of those problems.

Plus ranked choice voting can be used to game the system, so I'm not in favor of it at all.

These things always seem to be brought up by people who think that third parties act as nothing more than spoilers and are trying to subvert the will of the voters who vote for third party candidates.

When voter turnout is the main problem, i don't see how lessening the importance of those who do show up as a reasonable solution. round ballot being jammed into a square voting booth hole"
