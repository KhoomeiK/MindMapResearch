The Bears usually give the GM-type some leash and fired Emery fast. It was totally because he chose Trestman over Arians."
GenderCritical,fh5829p,t1_fh2nov0,1581285992.0,"I disagree with you in the sense that threaten women because they see them as subhuman. They wouldn’t wish for a feminine reality if they thought feminine traits were subhuman. They threaten women because, in the back of their mind, they know they are still men and have thicker bones, more upper body strength, etc... compared to a biological woman. 

So, they threaten women rather than men because they know, in a physical confrontation, they possess an advantage against most women. Against other men? They will likely get a kicking. The proverbial wolves in sheep’s clothing that will threaten the sheep and hide behind them when the actual wolves and sheepdogs come calling. Not that I mean to call women “sheep”, just using a metaphor. 

TL:DR: They threaten women because, in a physical confrontation, they know they are biologically men and possess an advantage. They are bullies that run from the bigger kids and focus on those they think they have an advantage on."

The Bears problem the past 3 decades is that they refused to adapt to the modern game. They think good defense, run the ball and solid ST will win you a SB. So they didn’t give a crap about QBs and WRs. Even though the only SB we’ve been to since ‘85 was arguably lost by our incompetent QB.
