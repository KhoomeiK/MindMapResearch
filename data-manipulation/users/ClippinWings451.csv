Same thing.



>I understand that everybody should have a stake.

Well, then let's limit voting to Tax Payers?

Aside from the obvious discrimination of your statement, a stake, a sense of being a part of, of contributing to society as a while, is a positive, it prevents apathy, it discourages isolation of those who feel marginalized.

Think of it like this... if a group of your friends all pitched in to buy another friend a present... but did not let you contribute, would you feel the same sense of giving, of being part of that group who participated, when the present is given to your friend?

>I want to eliminate all taxes

In a perfect world yes.

That's maybe the disconnect here... I'm I'm a Right Libertarian, but also a realist. So while I would probably be an anarcho-capitalist in a perfect world... I also realize that's simply not possible now or in any foreseeable future. Thus, I don't really advocate for those ideas when discussing hypotheticals like the question you posed.



>If we want to keep the current social order, i think it is best to have a flat tax rate and to have a discount.

That sounds like a nice idea.... But but then it's a progressive tax and not a flat tax.

Which I am adamantly against, thus my idea for a low flat tax, augmented by a consumption tax.



>That way all the people who pay taxes anyways pretty much pay the same amount. However, we give leaveway and more freedom and libertarianism to those who need it the most.

As a whole we’ve drifted left, with the left particularly moving hard left.

Some Examples: 

* Trump being far and away the most moderate Republican President in history. But the left calling him “far right”

* democratic socialists are now main stream political candidates and elected officials

* Obama recently being labeled a “conservative”

* single payer is considered remotely acceptable 

I'd also say Spencer’s “social rightness” is rather left, considering it is rooted in the same divisive identity politics the left champions

Also, I think you can see the divergence in our positions with your statement:

> True socialist movements are essentially egalitarian

yeah, no... I just can't agree with that idea.

I mean, I know it's promoted as such... but that's not socialism in practice, it's just what the poor are told to get them to fight for it. Sure, you may claim that's not ""true"" socialism... but it's the way socialism is always implemented, so it is the only ""true"" socialism in any realistic sense.

The government seizing power and control from the people, because they've been deemed not capable of making decisions for themselves, and not worthy of success, is the exact opposite of egalitarianism.
