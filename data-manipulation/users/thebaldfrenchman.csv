college,fesbt2z,t3_eqh9zn,1579363626.0,"C is passing, so no sweat. You won't have to take it over, but yes it will have bearing on GPA. OSU pre med here, take occasional classes at CSCC. Chem was def one of them. No Physiology lab at OSU either. OSU has a suck ass chem staff. PM me if ya want."
college,fesaqa9,t3_eqfazs,1579363327.0,"I did this (w 2 others) for one of my adjuncts. We actually gave it to her in person, on her campus, after semester was over. One citizen gifting something to another, nothing wrong with that. Sometimes it works out that we keep in touch and become friends with some of the people who helped get us to where we are."
college,fes9x6u,t3_eqhvae,1579363051.0,Far worse IMO
college,fes9p86,t3_eqhwju,1579362968.0,Been there done that. Ya just figure it out. Drop something hard and do it over summer? Plan plan plan. Soooooo happy to be in a semester of liberal arts electives and just taking it easy.

Had double Scarf procedure at the Chesapeake Research Group near Baltimore. They do clinical trials, so both were free. PM if you need a link to the facility!"

AskReddit,fepg6cn,t3_eq48n1,1579319678.0,My mom and dad were best friends with another couple they are still close to in high school. One evening the friends (who are married) revealed to me that they used to have orgies with my parents and that they were rather gender fluid during these encounters. They mentioned that I almost had a different dad.....
AskReddit,fenooeu,t3_eptxb3,1579288678.0,"Not sure if disturbing, but odd nonetheless. Worked a large format wine shop, wine manager took me under his wing and stayed with me, supporting me up to paying for my Sommelier exams. Incredible teacher, mentor, supporter. Years later, his partner sought me out to tell me of his death and my part of his will. A bit suprised, as I had only ever heard of his wife, never boyfriend/husband. Fellow coworker said it all made sense, we never actually saw his wife, and how he bestowed so much attention on me as I was so much younger (and probably attractive). He never once made things akward, but hiding his homosexuality I found odd, as I was out with him. Still miss the guy to this day like a father."

My school has surgical tech, vet tech, respiratory therapy, radiology tech, but all have premed courses to get in, and third party testing (HESI, ATITeas). Talk to an advisor and get started asap."
