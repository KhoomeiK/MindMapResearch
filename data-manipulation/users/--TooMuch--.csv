bipolar,ffqsjhy,t1_ffqsi4v,1580142652.0,Go fuck yourself.
BipolarReddit,ffqs7j5,t1_ffqr7mw,1580142430.0,Thank you!
bipolar,ffqs64t,t1_ffqr3xm,1580142403.0,But you managed to argue with two people. Impressive.
bipolar,ffqqxlo,t1_ffqql9i,1580141578.0,Oh excuse me. My post.
bipolar,ffqq2cc,t1_ffqpdob,1580140991.0,Thanks for hijacking my thread.
BipolarReddit,ffqoluu,t1_ffqnx5j,1580139996.0,"Please site these sources as my treatment team doesn’t seem to agree, they say that’s part of why bipolar never goes away, but BPD can with DBT and extensive therapy. Peruse the BPD forums. They definitely describe episodes being triggered by emotions, many are on the same meds as us. I’d love to have real info to give them if I’ve been misdiagnosed or have a dual diagnosis."
bipolar,ffqo0ud,t1_ffqmekx,1580139599.0,"I’m one of that 10% that it probably will never resolve from my natural immunal response, and I have been treated by many board certified medical professionals at the top of their game for my HPV who agree. So your supportive words don’t really apply to my situation. Maybe don’t assume in the future that an OP needs baseline reassurance about the most harmless version of a virus with hundreds of strains. Had precancer removed from my (surgically)rectum and (LEEP)cervix. I can literally be sued for not disclosing."
BipolarReddit,ffqn2ot,t1_ffqlfoe,1580138938.0,That sounds more like BPD.
BPD,ffqmy8k,t3_eupbpx,1580138852.0,Same. The humiliation is so intense and I’m devastated.
BPD,ffqlah9,t1_ffql34y,1580137653.0,"Same. I’m on meds, have been active, getting rest, but I’m dealing with some hardcore suicidal ideation. I just lost my FP and don’t have anyone else who remotely understands me."
BPD,ffqkysx,t3_eup0la,1580137414.0,Same.
twinflames,ffqkugb,t3_eunuck,1580137323.0,Are you me? I swear I could have written this.
bipolar,ffqkm50,t3_euo5bq,1580137151.0,"Good, maybe gross people will stop hitting on me now."
BipolarReddit,ffqkfs1,t3_euoqz4,1580137020.0,"Other than brain altering things like drugs, it’s just a cycle. Some stuff makes it worse, but it doesn’t cause it. Work stress, illness, fights make it worse for me. But I’m mostly an anxious and angry hypomanic."
bipolar,ffqk604,t1_ffqjsmk,1580136817.0,Same!
bipolar,ffqi24z,t3_euhjzs,1580135187.0,No.
bipolar,ffqhknc,t3_eun8dt,1580134798.0,Yep.
bipolar,ffqhaz0,t1_ffqd0ff,1580134580.0,Mines lasted 17 years. When should I expect it to go away?
BipolarReddit,ffpy8uf,t1_ffpy4lq,1580110656.0,Both? At least their lives were worth something to the world.
BipolarReddit,ffpx74b,t3_euig7t,1580109315.0,I just wish it were me and not those other people.
bipolar,ffpx3se,t3_euilzx,1580109197.0,I have zero reason to be alive anymore. So I can’t help.
HPV,ffpcazs,t1_ffowdhk,1580091477.0,I’m 38. Probably not.
HPV,ffkkusn,t1_ffil1pv,1580024440.0,I’m celibate now.  Probably won’t have sex again as I don’t have a partner; who wants a mentally ill woman with high risk HPV. So I get ya.
BPD,ffkkjsp,t3_eu3pnm,1580024294.0,I know those feels. Hugs!
HPV,ffi9rsa,t1_fffkqw6,1579968719.0,Anal sex can cause micro abrasions in your rectal cavity and can make it even easier to spread warts. Even with condoms. I had rectal surgery this past year for them. But just rubbing his balls on your butt hole can also spread them.  So make sure your rectum is examined and not just your vagina.
HPV,ffi98bj,t1_ffgtc3i,1579968342.0,Not accurate nor available in the US.
HPV,ffi90ve,t3_etib6i,1579968195.0,"Insurance isn’t a person and it doesn’t have the ability to cares bout you. Just assume this will be expensive, as you have, and keep treating yourself like you matter. Because you do. Hugs!"
bipolar,ffi8nme,t3_ets6rq,1579967934.0,"Unless it’s causing hypomania, usually it takes a few weeks for extended release pills to do anything. Unless you note your side effects getting worse, you’ll probably just need to wait and see."
BPD,fffv6pa,t1_fffv1so,1579892498.0,"If it gets worse, please call them on Monday. They’ll probably just tell you to stop the meds if they’re new. That’s what mine does with extreme side effects."
bipolar,fffuyxq,t1_fffsj9x,1579892365.0,Same.
BPD,fffuw6b,t1_fffuumw,1579892318.0,"That’s a ways away. I’d call today if it isn’t too late, or Monday."
BPD,fffut5c,t3_eteppk,1579892266.0,You need to tell your prescriber this is happening. It’s not a desired effect and could lead to worse side effects.
bipolar,ff3fgrs,t3_erfo9o,1579539981.0,"I’m old and have sex infrequently so I’ll probably just stick to condoms as I’m down with abortion. But I was on one form of birth control or another from age 14-37. It masked my more hormone influenced symptoms of BP2 for years, as I was just diagnosed."
bipolar2,ff1t7lj,t3_er5saf,1579485641.0,Commenting to check back later!
HPV,ff1r7fy,t1_ff1mrik,1579484396.0,Semen doesn’t spread HPV.
HPV,ff1qxjl,t3_er1s5u,1579484220.0,"It all depends on your immune system. It can also be dormant as you generally become infectious or have an outbreak when your immune systems resistance drops for any number of health related reasons. So take good care of your immune system, live a healthy life and the chances are greater that you will clear it or it will at least remain dormant."
STD,fezfjp6,t1_fezeiug,1579456836.0,"Yeast isn’t an incredibly uncommon issue, women get it for no apparent reason. There’s over the counter creams and probiotics to help with it. You might have rubbed yourself raw allowing for a yeast infection to set in, and just need to chill on fapping. But as it’s lasted months and you’re new to this, a doctor visit is the best bet. Then you’ll know what it actually is and feel more confident dealing with it in the future. Don’t be embarrassed, it’s normal to visit your doctor for this. Especially as a guy."
STD,feze6zi,t3_eqyzdl,1579456443.0,Could be yeast or other non sexually transmitted diseases. Best to see your doctor as it’s lasted a while. That must be uncomfortable!
bipolar,feg41yb,t3_eotmn4,1579075965.0,"I had all of the common side effects after about two months on it. They were unbearable and lead to a hypomanic episode. The worst was the loss of my fine motor skills. They’re not quite back. I’m sensitive to many medications, so it’s not totally surprising. I didn’t have any positive effects from it."
bipolar,fefhbar,t3_eovldf,1579056316.0,"That sounds like my Cymbalta withdrawal, not really seizures but might as well be it’s so debilitating. It will eventually end, though it doesn’t feel like it. I wanted to die so badly. I took fish oil mega doses to help my brain recover and they eventually they went away. But it was the most brutal thing I experienced. At least on par with the destructive mania that preceded it when I was on the drug and ruined my life."
bipolar2,fefcp0r,t1_fefbc06,1579053459.0,"Yep, from conversations I’ve had in my head. Or events based partially on things that did happen, half truths I’ve imagined. Delusional thinking mostly, sometimes shadowy hallucinations. I have to get pretty bad for that to happen though."
bipolar2,fe6m4tn,t3_enzqnk,1578895575.0,I see shadows of things and created memories. I’ve also seen the stoplight smile. Recently at least.
bipolar,fe5uqnl,t3_enw0jt,1578875390.0,"I’m not at those dosages (BP2), but same. Seroquel and Xanax/klonopin really helped get me out of a never ending hypomanic episode full of delusional thinking and endless physical anxiety. I do get very depressed and they can’t figure out what to do about that except the lithium, which helps a little at my tolerated dosage. So it’s not just the most severe of us. It just depends on the episode, for some. It good to know what works for you."
BipolarReddit,fe5sqnq,t1_fe5s9bc,1578874123.0,"Frankly, being undiagnosed sounds less traumatic than her  diagnosed childhood. Bipolar is highly stigmatized. That’s probably why she uses drugs ie. self medicates now. Because her childhood was traumatic. Rehab helps with that too. 

BTW none of us are normal here. And have always been ourselves."
bipolar,fe5rh9e,t3_enuyjd,1578873556.0,Heck yeah! I haven’t done that in over a year!
BipolarReddit,fe5qxq5,t3_envrnq,1578873267.0,"Age 3? That’s too early to diagnose bipolar imo. At this point it sounds like she needs substance abuse help more than anything. But you can’t force adults into treatment. I’m so very sorry you’re dealing with this. That *she’s* dealing with all of this, as well.

Edit to add: happy is out of reach for many of us. Being okay is the goal. Offer her rehab, if you can."
HPV,fe544sw,t1_fe53gyx,1578865473.0,You’re welcome! It all depends on your immune system. So stay healthy. Good luck.
HPV,fe52x3i,t3_ensbtf,1578865186.0,"Typically within 4 months to a year depending on your health, if they reoccur at all. That’s why my doctor checks me quarterly."
bipolar,fe52701,t3_ensma5,1578865038.0,What do your blood tests say?
bipolar,fe3zl0w,t1_fe3yjrn,1578854359.0,You too!
bipolar,fe3nfzb,t3_ennldo,1578850979.0,Trying to get out and go tanning later. I hope it might help my SAD type symptoms and clear up a rash.
bipolar,fe3mqn0,t3_enpk50,1578850724.0,I had that problem too. I’m coming off of it now. Trying Latuda (drug number 8) next.
bipolar,fe2bnbl,t1_fe25b2w,1578836602.0,Second this. Also helps with hydration.
HPV,fdrehze,t1_fdr5jze,1578683402.0,It’s not HPV.
BipolarSOs,fdqzn05,t3_emu2aj,1578677473.0,Some of us bipolar people also have bipolar SO’s.
HPV,fdqsi26,t3_emsxdh,1578673930.0,"Have you ever touched another person sexually? If not, it isn’t an std."
bipolar,fdppt8u,t1_fdnhg6o,1578635967.0,Hypomania is ebbing. Some dumb shopping. Now I’ve lost control of my fine muscle movements completely. I’m using predictive text now.
bipolar2,fd7hlwk,t3_ek807n,1578204645.0,"I’m living this right now. Almost 40, no prospects for a real career."
bipolar,fd7gqlq,t3_ek83l7,1578204240.0,Take lithium and none of that applies.
BipolarReddit,fd6dzex,t1_fd67r1g,1578189526.0,I hope that happens in my lifetime.
BipolarReddit,fd5zxme,t1_fcy1iyt,1578183625.0,I just started trying and I’m 38. This really scares me.
bipolar,fcz75uy,t1_fcywyt9,1578095039.0,I feel you on the weird hurts. Only a touch better than Cymbalta withdrawal. That had the brain zaps.  Ugh
bipolar,fcyh9h6,t1_fcxtviu,1578080105.0,"I lowered it a month ago. I think I need to go back up, because hypomania sucks."
BipolarReddit,fcxt3g2,t3_ejhnfx,1578070041.0,38. It gets worse.
bipolar,fcxsr27,t1_fcxsgch,1578069967.0,Go away bot.
bipolar,fcxsotn,t1_fcxq9uk,1578069934.0,Sorry I keep responding funny. App is fucking up. I’m on er pills too.
bipolar,fcxsfgo,t1_fcv8r7n,1578069774.0,"It isn’t though, that’s why I’m concerned. Second major hypomanic episode in a year seems to making me manic now. Usually I don’t get this bad and rapid cycle through it all. But my life sucks pretty hard in ways that are not in my control but still affect me. Major physical health issues, multiple deaths, work problems, etc. when my life is stable, I’m more stable.  Doesn’t seem to be classic bipolar2. Which is what they’re calling me. I’m just getting worse. :("
bipolar,fcxridq,t1_fcr96fc,1578069436.0,"It sucked, but not as much as the mess I’m in from changing my antipsychotics. Had tremors make it hard to type."
bipolar,fcvsag2,t3_ej66yn,1578008969.0,I can’t stop racing thoughts and I feel subdermal electrical charges. Also perpetual tremors. It’s more like bad crack.
bipolar,fcvs3ke,t1_fcr96fc,1578008844.0,From 900-600. I’m quite sensitive.
bipolar,fcux89y,t1_fcuu9h4,1577990350.0,That seems like a cop out on their parts tho.
bipolar,fcux64n,t1_fcuvhku,1577990317.0,I’m reading a book that breaks it down further. Bipolar caused by life events and another caused by drugs or alcohol.
bipolar,fcut2jm,t1_fcusu4o,1577987949.0,"My second psychiatrist did as well, my current one said BP2. Maybe my therapist just sucks?"
sexuality,fcszbes,t3_eir32b,1577928872.0,Look up the concept of aftercare in bdsm. Ignore the other stuff if it isn’t your fancy. But aftercare can help the loss of happy chemicals after sex. Applies to all sexes.
bipolar,fcsz4i1,t3_eir219,1577928739.0,Don’t give them the satisfaction of being right. Create your own family when you’re able. I’m sorry they suck so hard.
bipolar,fcsyr4g,t1_fcsyd9y,1577928477.0,"I have high risk, long lasting HPV (16 years). Yeah, my worst treatment was rectal surgery. I don’t wish it on anyone. Maybe baby Hitler."
bipolar,fcswc77,t3_eh11ei,1577926766.0,"Goals:


-Find a sex therapist. My regular therapist just tells me I’m grieving my sex life. I’d like it to exist again, not perpetual grief. 


-Read my backlog of books. 


-Spend less money on “stuff” things. 


-Find a new place to live. 


Reflection: last year was the second worst year of my life. Not my doing. The end."

STD,fcsv9ue,t1_fcsv0vh,1577925995.0,"Azo makes an easy to use dip stick UTI test. Try that, and then go to the doctor either way to get what you need. But that can ease your mind. Keep a supply as they’re super helpful on when to go to the doctor. I’ve had UTI’s all my life. Sorry for you dude."
bipolar,fcsuzv4,t1_fcsussi,1577925790.0,"I’m totally celibate, so I just look for the cool ones. You’re right, you waste less time with sub par people without the chance of fucking. Lol."

STD,fcsu3bo,t3_eiq98z,1577925135.0,"So many things don’t make sense. Why does a cyst on your testicles cause UTI’s? Why regular urinalysis without symptoms? And UTI’s don’t just magically get better, they typically require antibiotics. What’s really up, dude?"
bipolar,fcsrqs6,t3_eiouwh,1577923440.0,"Start small. Pick two small things. Like walking around the block daily, or saving pennies. It’s doable!"

bipolar,fcob9rh,t3_ei94ky,1577828029.0,I take biotin. I was informed it could be a lithium thing. I had one and it grew out.
