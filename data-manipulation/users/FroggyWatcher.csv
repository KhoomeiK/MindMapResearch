Plus, habits are hard to break.

travian,fe6a8hv,t3_enrx13,1578885287.0,"Similar boat here. I am now playing on a server and I hope to make it all the way until the end of it. I'm having more fun than before, also because I have learned quite a few things on how to play. Travian changed a lot from those years back, now it exists in two variants: travian kingdoms and travian legends. Legends is the version you're used to with quite a few changes, but same at the core. Travian kingdoms to me feels like a money grab and I steered clear of it. I didn't really get it though, so I might just be wrong.

I'd recommend either looking for one of those sketchy 100000x speed servers and try out the new version for a weekend or so, or get into a speed server and find an alliance with whom you can find a dual to mentor you. I am 70 days into a normal speed server and I am still making quite a few mistakes along the way, but I haven't been this persistent with this game before. While the servers seemed to have become smaller (2000 or so people in the one I play), they have also made changes to how alliances work, there's now artifacts, the hero is a much more developed and central tool to the game (in a way that actually makes sense now, though it might be a bit of a gold sink if you spend money on the game)

If you want to be competitive, you will have to spend gold. That said, I think the game has become way more interesting, especially if you get to play with someone else. I haven't this time around sadly, but I'm hoping to do so in the next one I play.

I also noticed that they actually made it less pay2win in that you don't get that much advantage if you throw money into the game. You can buy 600gold and do just as well as someone who has bought 200. But this is also part of learning how to manage. I am probably one of the largest spenders in my alliance but definitely not that on top of my game. Gold works more as a safety net in that mistakes aren't so costly if you spend money, but among gold buyers, there's not really correlation between how much one spends and how likely they are to actually win.

Plus now they have in-game currency (silver) which you can convert to gold where 200 silver = 1 gold. (you can also convert gold to silver where 1 gold = 100 silver, which is annoying but also understandable).

Bottom line, I am having fun and if you are proactive and join an alliance and ask them for support, you're likely to make it.

In my experience so far, buying gold right now helps you with three things

* you become more competitive, get into the top stats boards more easily, but it won't make you win the game.
* You can offset possible mistakes you make more easily,
* You can be more independent and not rely so much on teammates.

However, the silver-gold system is because of now-existing auctions where you buy items for your hero that can give you bonuses of different sorts. To learn about this it really is best to just create an account and play for a little while, explore everything."

AskPhysics,fdsy0ev,t3_emz6w0,1578709415.0,"Okay maybe you're looking for the word electrodynamics, but that's not a field of research so much as just one domain in physics, like classical mechanics, or quantum mechanics, or relativity. They're not research fields, they're just subjects within the field of physics. Each of these (maybe except for relativity) was written based on an observation (postulates, like Newton's laws or the equivalent minimization of action, or the quantum mechanical formalism, or the postulates of relativity.) For electrodynamics, we started off with Coulomb's law (as far as I remember, empirically derived but you might want to check that info) and we eventually made our way to the notion of fields, what they are, and subsequently to what fields do even if there are no particles present - Maxwell's equations. In that sense, E&M is what is usually called a classical field theory. When we quantize (don't ask how) E&M to use photons, wavepackets, etc etc we obtain quantum electrodynamics (also not much meat to research here, most work has been done)

Thing is, the theory of electromagnetism has been pretty much a closed topic for a century or two - all the classical observations (anything from repelling charged ping-pong balls to how light refracts through glass or how its intensity changes when the medium changes) are predicted by the theory (as put by my advisor) ""to an awfully damn high degree of precision.""

Sadly, if you're in high school (or even starting college), you usually get a really inaccurate picture of research in the field, so it's understandable if you would like to do research on it - it's an extremely interesting topic and also one of the hardest courses I've taken in undergraduate physics, preceded only by quantum mechanics and relativity. Sadly, when we talk about cutting-edge/vanguard research in physics, we use quantum field theory as the framework, which comprises quantum electrodynamic theory, quantum chromodynamic theory and quantum electroweak theory (each for the type of force/interaction that exists), except when we look at the big universe out there, where we use general relativity (as a description of gravity). Even so, these are fields of knowledge, not so much fields of research. These theories are pretty set in stone."

Quick reminder that the SI unit of mass is the kilogram so you might as well say 1000kg instead of a megagram.

1st, assume the sun is at rest. You can get a quick answer (something, not much or nothing) in terms of comparing the sun's rest energy with the object's total energy.

The rest energy of the sun is on the order of the 10\^30kg\*c\^2. The energy of a metric tonne moving at 0.9c is 2.29\*10\^3 kg c\^2. The rest energy of the sun is absurdly larger, so imagine the small feeble guy punching the fat guy in the gelatinous gut, then looking at him in the face surprised it did nothing.

&#x200B;

Now going more in-depth. While weird stuff happens in relativistic limits, one thing we know to be true is that momentum is conserved. Then let's think of two possible scenarios: elastic and inelastic collisions.

Elastic: both KE and momentum are conserved. Then this problem is essentially a relativistic styrofoam bead hitting a stationary billiard ball. There isn't really a way to determine how fast the billiard ball will move after, that is left to observation. But the bead would essentially hit a stone wall and bounce back. The sun wouldn't budge. In fact, the center of mass of this system is essentially at the center of the sun, so the sun wouldn't even virtually move due to gravity. The energy transfer would probably be enough to make a lot of plasma, but that's what the sun is to start with.

Inelastic: the object sticks to the sun. Again, not much would happen. Maybe some coronal mass ejection, but it wouldn't rip the sun apart."
