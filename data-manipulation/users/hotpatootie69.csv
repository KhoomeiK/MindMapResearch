rupaulsdragrace,ffs5g5f,t1_ffs4y4d,1580173601.0,"Alyssa's second snatch game was a dumpster fire and is definitely what people mean when they say ""but it's okay because its Alyssa.""  it literally made zero sense and she wasn't even reacting to what was happening around her or answering the questions at all lol it was humorous because it was so fucking absurd but it was genuinely a really terrible performance lol"
civ,ffs2sl7,t1_ffs2bmu,1580171730.0,"Well, probably.  The reason you rush the slinger is to get the tech boost by killing an enemy with a slinger earlygame, and the reason you do that is to rush archery so you can avoid being taken down by neighbours who are cheating very liberally on higher difficulties. People really prioritize this because the game becomes unwinnable early on in the game on higher difficulties if your 4 starting city, triple your science production neighbour decides he doesn't like you. Generally, having one archer in every city is a good place to start with defending yourself without being super cost prohibitive."
rupaulsdragrace,ffs25xy,t1_ffs1ib8,1580171293.0,Award shows exist to sell you stuff. They've never been legitimate lol
civ,ffs0p6r,t1_ffr1iie,1580170300.0,"Slinger rush is a metagame choice and NOT an important one if you aren't using it to kill a barb, and rushing archery so you don't have your game ended by a neighbour in the first 30 turns. Honestly if you arent deliberately challenging yourself, just play on lower difficulties. It's more fun and you don't have to know about 1000 invisible moving parts to navigate a win"
civ,ffs06p4,t1_ffqgpf6,1580169942.0,"Contrary to what some might say, the game doesn't really become more fun on higher difficulties. It becomes unfair, and you have to exploit the game's weaknesses to win it.  Putting the difficulty on deity realistically strips a lot of what makes the game enjoyable in favour of a more explicit metagame. If you don't really care about ""solving"" deity, there's no real point in playing it, it's just a dumb metagame puzzle lol"
civ,ffrzpmb,t1_ffrjsty,1580169618.0,"A lot of people want to avoid war, at all stages of the game, with every given civ, no matter what. They also never learn the ""invisible"" game mechanics such as what goes into the AI's militaristic decisionmaking, or how and why the grievance system seems to punish you so harshly (ie  globally loved to hated in one turn because they go to war with a civ and everyone turns on you) for seemingly innocuous decisions. When you have knowledge of all of these things, decisionmaking becomes easier, and figuring out how to manipulate them to your advantage becomes the /real/ game within the game.  Yes, this probably makes them ""bad"" Civ6 players, but they honestly very likely have more fun playing it than I do anyways lol"
civ,ffrr0ew,t1_ffpectq,1580163896.0,"I'm not sure OP considered multiplayer, otherwise he probably would have rated civs like eleanor way lower because if I'm not mistaken french eleanor would be impossible to win against human players"
AskMen,ff58xob,t1_ff50fkf,1579583772.0,"Honestly, I don't have a hard time finding dates, but I'll make out with pretty much anyone I find attractive. It's fun lol"

Instagramreality,ff4gb8o,t1_ff3zrwn,1579562918.0,"Uh, models look completely different than they did 20 to 30 years ago which is exactly the time frame I provided, so clearly you are confused, but you are welcome to google pictures if it helps you. There's probably an infographic somewhere on the subject. Secondly, I literally said that it was the same old shit in a different package in TWO different ways in my post. Did you read it? The rest of what you've said is unintelligible conjecture with no foot in any real knowledge or fact so I won't bother."
civ,ff4g2tq,t1_ff3tp64,1579562759.0,You're saying that it isn't true and then go on to say that it is exactly true. Okay.
civ,ff1vxt6,t1_ff1rl6b,1579487395.0,"Umm, you continue to avoid the original point, which is that Gilgamesh always accepts first turn declarations of friendship. This is not something that can be disagreed upon, it's just fact. In your second reply you asked me what you could do to employ diplomacy. Thirdly, I told you that whatever way you wanted to play the game was the correct way to play it. You can choose to read some kind of ""hoity toity"" subtext into my posts, it is, however, your invention."
rupaulsdragrace,ff1ogrb,t1_ff1nek1,1579482644.0,You are not.
civ,ff1kur2,t1_ff1k72i,1579480810.0,"I'm not arguing semantics with you. You literally asked me what I would do to avoid early warfare, the fact that you closed your thought by saying that there isn't anything you can do doesn't make it less of a question."
Instagramreality,ff1kc9d,t1_ff1e46b,1579480573.0,"There were people in my HS who wanted to be models, too. But the market has changed. People dont want superhumanly, one in a million supermodels anymore. They want something accessible, relatable and thus we have instagram models. Same cake, different icing. Entertainment as we know it has shifted drastically over the past few decades, but the absurdity doesn't seem as staggering when you realize that it's the old beast we've always known with a new fur coat"
rupaulsdragrace,ff1g7d0,t1_ff1cb5j,1579478722.0,"The ""especially the year following the win"" is a part of a completely different idea lmao. In grammar, it's called a dependent clause, but really, the matter of your poor reading comprehension skills is not in question and you don't seem to be a person who can admit to their own faults so I won't bother responding to you again, babe"
civ,ff1euvi,t1_ff1d6u0,1579478305.0,"You asked a question and I've answered it. You can play civ however you want to play it, and however you choose to do so is the correct way to play it :)"
Instagramreality,ff1buhv,t1_ff0wktr,1579477274.0,"She's not trying to look reasonable lol she's posing for what will be a heavily edited photo. Obviously she looks insane, but really she was just working, and probably performing her job well. The finished product probably looks fine."
rupaulsdragrace,ff18whe,t1_ff17uyc,1579476414.0,"I didn't make the reigning queen comment, though I am not surprised that your reading comprehension has failed you and made you look a fool for a second time in this thread."
civ,ff18ezf,t1_ff15n97,1579476263.0,"Sending first turn delegations staves off early wars for a significant amount of time. Most civs will accept them turn one, but almost none of them will accept them after that (on harder difficulties) as they have automatic penalties that come into effect the following turn. This is the single most important part of avoiding warfare in the early game. Trading and gifting thereon builds the relationship, and plenty of civs have perfectly do-able agendas (and some that are literally impossible) you can fulfill. Don't piss them off with a forward settle and you should easily be able to cultivate a relationship with any civ. I have had Scythia and Hungary as friendly as early as classical era many times, and I spend economy to achieve this so that I don't have to waste 30 turns fighting them off. This is a core gameplay mechanic. You said it just there - you don't bother with delegations or gifts, so obviously, given the limited options that the game provides you with to perform diplomacy,  your early game requires more diplomacy. If your argument is that the diplomatic systems are simple, not exactly obvious, and easy to exploit, you would be correct, however they do exist and do function as intended. In any case, now you know that Gilgamesh will accept turn one declarations of friendship and can use that to your advantage."
