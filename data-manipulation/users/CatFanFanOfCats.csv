We spend $7 trillion, everybody else got the oil and we’re not winning anymore.” It’s reported that Trump was so angry at this point that he wasn’t breathing properly.*

First off, one need not spend all the cash immediately. A loan can be taken out against the properties to be paid back over time. The properties would receive monies from backpackers staying there and paying for their rooms/beds. Additionally, the homeless would be paying to stay there with vouchers. Yes, the money for the vouchers would come from the city, but it doesn’t have to come from the city exclusively. Charities can pitch in to pay for the vouchers as well.

The city would provide vouchers to the homeless (either a credit card device or actual paper vouchers) that the homeless use to pay for staying at the hostel.

It only seems to create a cycle of increasing violence, which when we get involved with ends up directly affecting us. 

It is true that this would mean turning a blind eye to the atrocities a wannabe conqueror like Saddam Hussein would commit. Which turns my stomach. But simply looking at recent history, us trying to reign in these bad guys has never resulted in anything resembling peace. It’s done more harm than good. As Picard said  (paraphrasing here) “sometimes you can do everything right and still be wrong.”"
science,fdm4062,t1_fdlx1yj,1578539261.0,"A couple answers. 

1: Kaiser Permanente. Growing by gangbusters. Doctors get to do what they do best and not worry about billing, finances, etc. The doctors get paid extremely well. 

1A: universal healthcare doesn’t mean the end of private practice. We have police, firefighters, libraries, the post office, and schools. All paid for by taxes, available for free to everyone. People still pay for private security, private schools, private mail services (FedEx/UPS), and private book sales. So having universal healthcare won’t mean the end of private healthcare if you want to spend money on it. 

2: The government funds all sorts of research and development. They provide money directly to companies to come up with new technologies. Think the space race and using private companies to develop new rockets. And then there’s JPL. Imagine healthcare research facilities in the form of JPL’s. It would be amazing. They have some of the greatest scientists in the world - getting paid by the government. So the answer to creating new breakthroughs in medicine isn’t providing a massive payout for some new cure, it’s providing the scientists the ability to do what they do best *without worrying if the company they work for is going to go bust.*

So, universal healthcare is not going to inhibit new discoveries, it won’t inhibit those from going to school, if anything it will encourage greater discoveries and promote more people to decide to become doctors and scientists.

Edit: Before you focus on my comment about the post office being free. Don’t miss the forest for the trees. You know what I mean. It’s a government run agency that provides universal service to everyone in the US at a reasonable cost."

No one thought the war would last mere days. This is why Hillary Clinton voted for the second gulf war. She thought it would be like the first. 

Anyways, Hussein invades Kuwait. US satellites showed Hussein massing on the border of Saudi Arabia, which got us permission as well as brought the Saudis on board to make a case to kick Hussein out of Kuwait. Bush, the first, brought the matter to the United Nations. He worked with a large assortment of countries to build a coalition to fight against Hussein. The United Nations agreed that Hussein needed to leave Kuwait and a mandate came down stating such. Bush went into Kuwait and kicked Hussein out of Kuwait. A lot of jingoistic people wanted Bush to go Into Baghdad and take out Hussein and take over the country. Bush said no, and ended the war in 4 days. He followed the mandate from the UN.

We live in a civilized society. Think of a city. A typical city has a post office, fire department, police, schools, and a library. All citizens of the city have access to all those services for free paid for via taxes (well aside from the post office). But in any case, healthcare facilities are part and parcel to a well designed city. It should exist for the benefit of all, paid for via taxes. How the taxes are structured is decided by society. 

Obviously if one doesn’t believe in publicly run police departments, fire departments, schools, libraries or post offices than it would be difficult to provide a reason for free healthcare services. But, if one does believe in those things we can figure out how to achieve it. 

Additionally, even with all those public services, we do have access to private services. So one could always spend more to use FedEx, a private school, private security, or even private healthcare.

Let’s just look at what *taking out the bad guys* has gotten us:

- Creation of Alqueda and thousands killed on 9/11. Directly attributable to the first gulf war.
