All formularies show that, generally speaking, males are more likely to commit dangerous acts, engage in underage drinking and drug use, and die of an accidental death than females.

TrueCrimeDiscussion,ffhh956,t1_ffhgsmb,1579935154.0,"Good for you. Every child psychologist has their hands full. Much more need than there is help. 

I actually ran a program that I got a stimulus grant for that helped young, disadvantaged adults. Besides poverty, the worse was a criminal record. We got very good at helping them take care of their records. Almost all were great people who were just in bad situations. We even had 2 that were charged with homicide but got the charges reduced to a manslaughter. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Once you add alcohol or drugs and a horrible home life, they don't have a chance. It was a great program though."
TrueCrimeDiscussion,ffhgftz,t1_ffhfj41,1579934162.0,"I'm talking about mature decisions. They know what death is, but it's not conceptualized the same as adults. That's why every juvenile tried as an adult must undergo psychological and psychiatric testing before they can be tried as an adult. Btw, I am against trying them as adults but I do feel that they need to be incarcerated the same as an adult. Some states used to put juveniles in with adult prisoners. They should remain in the juvenile system until they are more mature. 

Please read my other comments on this thread. I have been in the field for a long time. I'm not just talking out my behind, but I do feel that there are some people who are just evil and need to be put away for life."
TrueCrimeDiscussion,ffhfx8x,t1_ffhebma,1579933558.0,"True regarding the antisocial tendencies to an extent, however impulse control is also a sign of immaturity. You may not have felt that way, but MANY, MANY young people have felt like this and not acted on it. It's the lack of impulse control that sets them apart. Antisocial behavior in young people is diagnosed more as a conduct disorder which is a very wide ranging and ambiguous definition.

Young adults cannot fully comprehend the consequences of their actions until their brain is fully developed. This does not occur until the mid 20s. They can understand death, but the length of time is distorted until they have lived longer. It's basically the issue if they can fully conceptualize the long term results of their actions. This is why there are so many arguments about trying juveniles as adults in the court system. We are dealing with it with the banning of cigarettes and vapes until the age of 21. Apparently, they are mature enough to be in the armed forces and follow orders, but not smoke and drink alcohol. 

I'm too sleepy to pull studies regarding it right now, but they are continuing to find the the brain is maturing later and later in life. That's why young people who suffer a traumatic brain injury can recover, because their brain learns to reprogram itself."

TrueCrimeDiscussion,ffh4xp0,t3_etk9wr,1579923226.0,"The only thing I can add, from a long time ago, is that, until teens reach a level of maturity (usually in their mid 20s) they truly do not understand the finality of death. Therefore, they do not fully comprehend that these people are gone forever and that they will most likely be in prison for the rest of their lives. They think that 30 is old. They just can't grasp the consequences of their actions prior to committing them. That's one of the reasons why auto insurance rates are based on age, sex, marital status, birth or children and GPA. These are all indicators of maturity. 

It develops in their mind as a fantasy, usually as retaliation or punishment for the rest of the family. They rehearse it in their mind until it becomes like a mission. Add in teenage angst and low self esteem, you have a time bomb. Then, one day, they decide that the time is right and they just do it.

AnimalsBeingBros,fewp4ix,t1_feogdaq,1579417369.0,"If you had read my comment you would see where the problem occurred. Actually, there were many types of dogs that were aggressive enough for dog fighting but they did not have a thing called ""gameness"" that was bred into the pit bulls used for dog fighting. These are not the same pit bulls that were the nanny dogs. There are several lines of development within the breed. That's why it's important to buy from a reputable breeder who knows the lineage of the entire family line. The pit bulls were the nanny dogs. It was only recently that a combination of irresponsible pet owners and irresponsible breeding combined to make some pit bulls have undesirable traits. Breeders had bred out aggression but greedy breeders now don't care about behavior. That's why so many of the blue eyed blue nosed line of pit's have aggression issues. 

Pit bulls were taught to fight rats in a ring. Only recently were they used for dog fighting. They would have never survived as a breed if they attacked their humans. Although the reports state that attacks are committed by pit bulls, no one has actually done DNA testing to prove that it was actually a pit bull in all of these cases. In the few cases that they did the DNA testing, only a few were staffordshire terrier/pit bull lineage. Others had various other DNA from beagle to laborador to greyhound. This was from a study about 10 years ago.

Long story short, it's not the dogs' fault what is happening to them. There's good and bad dogs in every breed. I only get dogs from kill shelters and the worst I ever have had were black labs. Every pittie I ever had has been the sweetest, including around children. They are loving and protective of them. When people say that their dog ""just snapped"" without warning, that's a lie. No dog is suddenly going to just attack and kill them. There were signs that they either ignored or did not know about because they were inexperienced dog owners."

insaneparents,feppcyc,t1_fepj3zi,1579326870.0,I'm not sure. They just told me that when I was dealing with financial aid. They threatened to sic the IRS on the uncooperative parent
insaneparents,fepj1uo,t1_fepgomy,1579321772.0,It is in Ohio for financial aid. It's not a law per se but an IRS rule. Anything that has your social security number one it as a dependent or as a report for a not for profit organization. I'm not sure about for profit organizations. Nothing with the IRS is a law. It's all rules and regulations.
Wellthatsucks,fephowx,t1_fepf7jc,1579320770.0,"The most Australian thing ever. Poisonous insects, reptiles, arachnids, a duck/beaver with poisonous elbows, giant birds that won a war, the worse wildfires and heat on record, followed by flooding...a shark just taking a swim down a residential area."
YouShouldKnow,fepgx7q,t3_eqaf97,1579320204.0,Our Walmart will throw out cartfulls of food that does not expire until the next day rather than mark it down or donate it. The food bank will pick it up in the morning and distribute it before it has expired. They wouldn't even sell me one of the giant pizzas at a discount. They just threw it out. It's such a waste when there are homeless families living in the parking lot.
popping,fepg5ry,t3_eqayta,1579319667.0,"If you are going to do it yourself, disinfect the area and use moist heat on it-not just a heating pad. A very warm, wet paper towel works well. You can also use a sandwich size baggie filled with warm water and wrapped with the damp paper towel. It keeps the paper towel wet longer."

insaneparents,fep6i43,t1_fep5bb8,1579313232.0,Tell her that she isn't allowed to claim you unless she gives you the documents and gives you the documents as soon as she files this year so you have it early for next year. You can always claim yourself through self employment income even if you didn't have a paying job. It would extremely screw her. You could use that as a threat. I can explain more if it comes to that
insaneparents,fep4ut6,t3_eq906c,1579312170.0,"If she claimed you on her taxes, it's illegal to withhold the information from you. I would as them to contact her asking for the information immediately. If you are on good terms with the new husband, you could ask him to help you. If neither of your parents claimed you, ask your financial aid department to help you file as an independent student."

foodhacks,feobl6m,t3_eq5s11,1579297739.0,"I saw this on YouTube. She made it with self-rising flour and shaped it into English muffin shapes. She let it sit for 20 minutes and then fried them in way too much oil. They looked like a crispy, fried English muffin. She doubled the recipe and it made 4 regular size muffins."
pitbulls,feo8c0m,t1_fent196,1579296475.0,I do appreciate the way that it was done respectfully though. There's so much hatefulness on reddit now. It's nice to see someone being polite.
pitbulls,fenr83w,t1_fen9q8d,1579289665.0,Sorry. Thanks for the correction.
