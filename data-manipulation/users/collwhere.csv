Wait for what your specialist has to say. If that's not good, try a different vet. Trust your gut. If you aren't ready (and I wouldn't be), keep trying. 

I would talk to the vet before introducing new protein though, because it's one more thing for her little body to process through and since it's so new, I am not quite sure what people are experiencing with it."

For pumping at work, I have the same issue, and I know they are supposed to provide time and place, but I just can't take that time. Makes me anxious and insecure for missing work time and that doesn't help either. 

I had freemie cups first, and would just stick them in my nursing bra and pump at my desk every two to three hours. I ended up taking the hit and getting a pre-owned Willow and I was terrified because I've heard some bad things. It took some getting used to, but it was life changing right out of the box. I literally pump doing anything (I don't pump laying down though because it just feels weird to me). I pump cooking, I pump cleaning, I pump at work, driving, whatever. Makes it easier for me not to miss a session because I don't have to pause life to pump every couple of hours. I just go into the bathroom, pop them in, and that's it. I do set an alarm once through the night, put them in, lay back a little and nap for 25 minutes (I set an alarm for when it's done too... you don't want it to stay latched for too long or your nipples will swallow). Made things a lot easier for me. There is a group on Facebook called Willow BST.

It’s hard to judge people behind a screen. So much gets lost. 

But in rescue, we should really try to work with each other and help each other. Even it’s talking through cases and venting and all. 

I’m glad I got to hear more about your work. And thanks for being so nice about me losing my shit lol"
reactivedogs,fdozk6e,t1_fdowre1,1578616473.0,"And I’m sorry for being a dick when I said you should leave what you do. 

I also do all my work as a volunteer. I am currently working with a Jack Russel that the shelter was ready to put down because of “unpredictable behavior and aggressiveness”. She has been with me for almost four months and is going home on Saturday. And there have been so many more like that. I worked with a senior rescue too, and there, a lot of times I had to be the mean one because people didn’t realize how much the dog was suffering. 

What we (you and I and other rescues) do is not easy. I also have to work on my ability to let go. Because I know we can’t save them all but that still breaks my heart. 

I have worked with a few sanctuaries and have seen REALLY bad cases. I know a place or two that are likely to take him. And like I said, you’re right, sanctuaries aren’t the holy grail of rescues. But if it’s a possibility, it’s definitely worth a try. One of the places I know is a lady and her family and they tend to the dogs, and horses, and donkeys and whatever else. They are retired early and have the care for certain dogs that need it. I am really hopeful that she might help. 

Again, I also have to work on my ability to let go, because I do want to save them all and I know it’s impossible."

reactivedogs,fdoukhr,t1_fdopk9b,1578613210.0,"You edited to add the last paragraph. 
Not all places are made the same. Maybe you don’t know the places that I know. 
I agree with u/oliveang that it seems like you’re not in the right line of work. Euthanasia is the last resort. Not the “he is seven and lived enough”. You don’t get to choose that. And you don’t get to push people that are heart broken about their situation to do it. NOBODY will feel better after killing a perfectly healthy dog."
reactivedogs,fdoqbtb,t1_fdopk9b,1578610471.0,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and for the work you do. But I disagree and have worked with multiple dogs ruled non adoptable. I don’t think killing this dog is the answer. In cases like this, euthanasia has to be the very last resort. I know places. I might be able to help. OP is doing everything they can and I know how heartbreaking it is because I’ve been there. But they will carry this with them forever. If at the end, euthanasia is the way to go, OP didn’t have to make that decision themselves without exhausting all other options. I have seen much worse cases than this one that had a happy ending."
reactivedogs,fdooq9h,t1_fdolhhf,1578609502.0,"I will disagree and say he still has a lot of life to live. 
I don’t know what kind of environment you currently are (big city, suburbs, etc). But I would look for an animal sanctuary or a rescue that has one. I think he could be happy at a place like that. I work with multiple rescues and we have had a lot success with doing that. He needs to be in a farm or a ranch. He can run free and not worry about noises and people. 
If you are comfortable, message me with your location (just the state) and maybe I can reach out to some people and we can see what we can find for him! 
Please let me try to help before you put him down"

The way I found to stick to a schedule and pump as much as I need to is using freemie cups with my pump. I just stick it in my bra.
