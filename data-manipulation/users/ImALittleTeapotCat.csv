MomForAMinute,ffrw6tr,t3_euw4o9,1580167240.0,"Sib, being a good or bad parent isn't that simple.  Good parents can have bad moments. Bad parents can have good sides.

However. Not knowing your child was abusing another of your children is pretty bad. Knowing, and doing nothing is spectacularly bad. Having your child tell you someone has abused them and doing nothing is pretty darn bad.

Your mom may not have been all bad. But at least in this area, she messed up, big time. And you can be angry or upset or confused or anything. It may take you a while to figure out how you feel, and your emotions will probably change. It's ok.

MomForAMinute,ffqyb9o,t3_euprvt,1580146376.0,"Sib, true beauty comes from within. Yes, it sounds like something that people say to make the less attractive feel better, but its actually true.

Think of the people you know. Do you know someone who is conventionally not physically attractive, but who is genuinely a good, kind person? Do you think they're ugly? If you stop to really consider it, you would probably say that yes they're ugly. But your immediate answer is probably no, you think they're quite pretty. And its because they are a good, kind person. It matters.

Also think of someone you know who is physically meeting the arbitrary standards of physical beauty, but is also not a nice person. Lying, cheating, making fun of people in a mean way, etc. Do you still think they're pretty? 

A lot of people aren't capable of looking past the physical appearance. Your mom is one of them. And they are lesser for it. Because the most beautiful person can also be the most cruel.

I know you live at home, but you can still live almost like you did when you didn't. I'm sorry you had to find out that your mother is defective, especially when you're living with her.

First, you need to improve your ability to earn money. Think through options, including trades or skilled work. It's not ""follow your dream"", its ""can support yourself and not hate the job"". Then look into how you get the training. You probably need to go home for a while so you can get whatever training. Keep in mind what kind of work is available in that area, or if your partner could move somewhere else.

But most importantly, you need to stop allowing your heart to make decisions. Your heart can set goals, your head gets you to them. So cut out that ""I can't leave him"" stuff. Yes, you can. You don't want to. You want to be an adult, well then you gotta act like one. And adults don't actually get to do whatever they want.

Once you've figured out how you're going to support yourself and have the training and whatever else to accomplish it, then you can work on what the heart wants. Don't forget you have to repay everyone who has helped you out too. I hope you're keeping track.

Also, it sounds like you have bipolar or something. You need to work on keeping that properly controlled as well. Otherwise, you're just going to smash your life again sometime in the future. 

I know it sucks. However, there isn't a magical way to get what you want. You're going to have to set goals and work hard. That's the only way you'll be able to succeed."

First, the stuff. The less stuff you have, the easier it is to keep things neat. Everything should have a place. When you're done using something, don't just put it down. Put it away. It takes just a few seconds, but it really adds up over time.

Then the cleaning. I try to vacuum and dust weekly. Wash windows 2x a year unless you get something on them. Curtains same. I try to sweep hard floors weekly, then they shouldn't need to be washed more than once a month, if that. 

Cleaning up small messes as you make them means that you can stretch out your big cleanings a bit, especially in the kitchen and bathroom. In the kitchen, cook, eat, then do the dishes. Depending what you're cooking you can often do some cleanup as you go. After you do the dishes, wipe down the counters, stove, etc. 

Bathrooms do a full clean monthly at least. Kitchens usually monthly.

First, it's not required that you be friends with roommates. Friendly is good. Friends is very different. The main problem here is one of communication. She doesn't want to be friends. You do. And instead of you two talking through this, she behaved in an immature way. There is a reason why so much of the advice people get boils down to use your words. You tried. She didn't, then sent a very unfriendly message. 

So, you're not friends, and probably won't ever be friends. First, next time you see her, use your words. ""Roommate, I got your message. In future, if there is a problem I would appreciate it if you could have a conversation with me rather than sending a similar message."" Done.

Next, you need actual friends. Hang out with them. Time at home is not time hanging out with her. Don't be mean or anything, but you're cordial  strangers now. You coordinate on roommate stuff. Be a decent person, but recalibrate to not-friends."

Your Filipino family loves and accepts you regardless of your name. The other half of your family is racist, and their rejection of you is about them. You didn't do anything wrong by being born.

I find it interesting that all this happened when you weren't in the conversation, or even in the room. Your DH messed up here.

If not, work on getting yourself to that point, where you have the ability. You don't have to leave, but you don't want to be unable to leave.

Also, for people who have anxiety, their treatment does not include avoiding everything that is hard. Because when you think hard and allow yourself to avoid it, in your head it just gets harder. It makes the problem worse. There's a reason why exposure therapy is a real treatment. When you do the scary thing, you start to realize it's not quite so bad."
MomForAMinute,ff018t6,t3_er0n4p,1579464046.0,"Sib, there are 2 things I'm thinking here. First, education and an environment that is positive might help. Check out scarleteen.com. its targeted towards teens, but good info and definitely positive. 

Second, I honestly wonder if this is related to anxiety or similar. Like a phobia. So resources and techniques that help with those kinds of things might help you cope.

Bottom line, there is nothing to be ashamed or afraid of. But convincing your emotions of that isn't always easy."
centuryhomes,ff009hm,t3_er0sqk,1579463750.0,"Well, folding it up isn't a good start! I'm not an expert, but I do know some. Paper dries out and becomes brittle as it ages. It must be handled carefully, and depending on its condition may not be safe to unfold it without damage. Wear gloves to prevent your skin oils from getting on it at all times.

When you get it to the point where it can be framed, use archival quality materials and get glass that will protect it from the light. 

For further guidance, I would look online, specifically check museums, big libraries, research universities, and other groups that handle conservation of materials. They may have advice."

Some of the physical wire is still in the walls, but we confirmed that none of it was live. When I told my insurance agent I'd rewired the house and what we found, he winced.

MomForAMinute,femu1t5,t3_eq0d18,1579269591.0,"Hi sib, you're right, it's something you have to learn.

First, the stuff. The less stuff you have, the easier it is to keep things neat. Everything should have a place. When you're done using something, don't just put it down. Put it away. It takes just a few seconds, but it really adds up over time.

Then the cleaning. I try to vacuum and dust weekly. Wash windows 2x a year unless you get something on them. Curtains same. I try to sweep hard floors weekly, then they shouldn't need to be washed more than once a month, if that. 

Cleaning up small messes as you make them means that you can stretch out your big cleanings a bit, especially in the kitchen and bathroom. In the kitchen, cook, eat, then do the dishes. Depending what you're cooking you can often do some cleanup as you go. After you do the dishes, wipe down the counters, stove, etc. 

Bathrooms do a full clean monthly at least. Kitchens usually monthly.

But all of this - adjust based on real life. I have cats so some things I'm doing daily because they made a mess."

So, a secret that really shouldn't be. You don't have to involve your mother in your wedding. Her behavior is setting herself up for a reality that she probably won't like much, but that's on her. You can plan and execute the wedding you want without her. You can live your life how you want, without regard to what your parents think. It doesn't make you a bad person.

In the last month or so, Captainawkward.com had a post about weddings. Different situation, but the advice will work for you too."
MomForAMinute,fejjfkx,t1_feinywj,1579176803.0,"Ok. Keep the 3rd apology very short. Like 2 sentences, and not long sentences. After that, any more is just awkward for her. ""I don't want to be boring, but I truly am sorry about what I did, and I'm going to work with my therapist to figure out how to react differently in future."" Sonething like that.

But changed behavior is the key. You got stuck in your head and had an outburst. You need to figure out how not to get stuck in your head, how to get unstuck, and when you are stuck how not to do this sort of thing again.

You have a therapist? Tell them exactly what happened. They can help you with this."
MomForAMinute,feif80v,t3_ep9ljl,1579137128.0,"Sib, you need to apologize again. A real one. You're sorry, you know you messed up, you won't do it again. And the most important part: what you're going to do so you don't do it again. 

Then, work on it. Work to improve yourself.  Yes, you have bpd. That's an explanation, not an excuse. Keep trying to be better. That more than anything will convince her you meant it."
MomForAMinute,feieuq4,t3_ep9su3,1579136878.0,"Sib, if at all possible, it's not a good idea. You'll pay fees and interest so you'll get less in total.

Can you borrow money from someone? Or delay? Cut expenses? Sell something? Check if you can sell plasma too.

Also, let's work on fixing your underlying situation so this emergency doesn't happen again. At least you can try. A realistic budget will help. And setting some money aside every paycheck for a rainy day can really make a difference. Even little bits can add up."
MomForAMinute,feiediq,t3_epac13,1579136554.0,"Sib, I know losing control over what you eat is scary. But it would be temporary, if it happened at all.

MomForAMinute,fefb59r,t1_fef9dkc,1579052441.0,"Emotions aren't going listen to reason, they just are. Don't try to pretend to be ok when you're not. Take things hour by hour if you need to. Ask for help from friends and family. And find somewhere safe where you can just talk.

You're struggling now. You will continue to struggle for a while. But you won't ALWAYS struggle. Just keep going, and do things to try to get better, and one day you'll realize that things actually are getting better. It's just not today."
MomForAMinute,fef8olo,t3_eoufaj,1579050808.0,"Sib, please kick him out. It doesn't matter if you have BPD, that was cruel of him. You deserve better. Kick him out, and start looking for a new job.

Then, I want you to spend some time focusing on yourself. Your parents have a serious problem here, they are not being good parents. And honestly, if at all possible, find yourself a new therapist. I would seriously consider reporting a therapist who was ok with a 22 year old dating and mistreating a 16 year old, regardless of their mental health status. That age gap is fine when you're older, but right now you're still a minor and he is taking advantage of you."
MomForAMinute,fef8b7a,t3_eol0ir,1579050558.0,"Sib, it wasn't ""let them"". It was save your life. Ectopic pregnancies can kill the mother. You didn't have a choice. There was literally no option that kept you alive and kept you pregnant. Medical technology does not have the ability to move everything from the tube to the uterus.

I know it hurts that you can't have another naturally. That's not wrong. But you don't need to feel guilty because you did the only thing you could do. 

You are alive, for you, your husband, your little one at home. You have a future, you just don't see it yet.

Right now, you're still recovering from the surgery I'm betting. Your body isn't fully healed yet. Take care of yourself. And look for a support group in your area for women who are struggling with fertility, or are infertile for some reason.  In a few weeks or  months, attend and try them out. Or if you can afford it, find a therapist who can help you figure out how to cope. 

It will take time, but you will be ok. You don't have to forget this, but you can live with the memories."

He was reported missing in early December, body found in a landfill in late March (not saying the year, but its been a while). His car was found around the time he was reported missing. Apparently he'd been in trouble with the law, spent time in jail for home invasion and drugs. I don't see anything else though.
