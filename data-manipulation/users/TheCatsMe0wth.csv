AnimalCrossing,ffb64cz,t3_esmw3y,1579752806.0,"What about it says we'll be getting a Special Edition Lite? 

I used to work for Nintendo of Canada, and that just looks like normal advertising for a Nintendo game coming out in a few weeks, perhaps as part of a Lite bundle. 

The Lite at the bottom also reminds people what console the game plays on. They're maybe pushing the Lite instead of the regular Switch because it's cheaper and more accessible to new consumers.

Nintendo doesnt really ""give out"" clues in their advertising. We'll either get one or we wont. I know we're hungry for info, but it's important to remain patient and not speculate 😅"
AnimalCrossing,ff8eztg,t3_es85s3,1579675640.0,"Nintendo devs aren't really known to cave from outside pressures.

They do their thing and they know you'll still buy the game. Call-out culture in Japan isn't the same as it is in North America, and it definitely doesn't yield the same results. 

I genuinely hope I'm wrong and they include cloud-saves because it's common sense, but Nintendo has this weird ""you *MUST* play the way *WE* want you to play"" fixation with most of their games - **even if the person 'cheating'** (timeskipping, getting rare pokemon, etc) **isn't ruining the game for other players.**"

You'll need to order NFC stickers from Amazon, and you also need a phone with NFC capabilities. After that, it's super duper easy.

AnimalCrossing,fepppn9,t1_fepc3uo,1579327184.0,"Since you're not personally going to Japan and picking it up yourself, that's the price you're going to pay for the *convenience* of having it purchased by someone else who actually is/was in Japan and then having those items shipped to you directly. It's unfortunate, but that's how it works.

Unless you know someone personally who would only charge you for the item(s) and postage, there's a *very* slim chance you're going find those items **at cost** outside of Japan. Remember: you're paying for the *convenience*

Sellers (**scalpers**) want to make a profit, and with Animal Crossing being as popular as it is, I don't foresee those prices changing any time soon.

""*The four main series games are among the best-selling video games for their respective consoles.*"" 
[source](http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-USPlatinum.shtml) 

**It's one of Nintendo's most popular franchises,** with over **30 million units sold** in total. It has been [both](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing) critically and commercially successful 

As an aside, in 2018, Pocket Camp made [$50M](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.macrumors.com/2018/09/07/animal-crossing-50m/amp/) in Global Revenue

So the series actually does *very* well. Nintendo just has a history of being secretive for various reasons; one of which is to build hype."

Congrats ! :) I'm excited to get my baggy, too."
cats,fdi45bq,t1_fdhwo37,1578435403.0,"Agreed. 

The cat doesnt *need* to be let out. If OP doesn't know how to properly control and provide a stimulating environment for their Begal cat, which is known to be full of energy, then OP shouldn't have that breed at all. 

It's clear that OP did **not** do their research before buying, and cannot handle the extra responsibility of providing a better environment for their cat so they chose the easy way out and let her outside, which is dangerous and cruel. 

There are many many risks; injury (which could have been avoided), diseases, exposure to the elements, mites, etc. Not to mention wreaking havoc on the local wildlife population. 

I sincerely hope that OP has taken most of these comments (minus the insults because it's neither productive or nice) into consideration and keeps their kitty indoors from now on. If not, u/__Darkwing__, PLEASE consider rehoming her to a family who CAN provide her with a better indoor environment."

NintendoSwitch,fcst7ok,t3_einlao,1577924499.0,"Don't bother with anything ""Harvest Moon""-related post 2013. It's cheap gameplay. *Story of Seasons* **USED** to be known as *Harvest Moon* in North America, but that changed a few years ago and now the company that owns the name ""Harvest Moon"" has been publishing sub-par games with the hope of tricking longtime *Story of Seasons* fans. 

*Story of Seasons* really is the standard of farming simulations; I don't care what anyone says about Stardew Valley (which was obviously heavily influenced by SoS). I totally get what you're saying about the graphics. I have about 70 hours on Stardew but I cringe looking at the game. 

Unfortunately, there is no standalone version of SoS on the Switch, besides the Doraemon crossover. I'm hoping SoS: Friends of Mineral Town is released in North America this year.

NintendoSwitch,fcodkrf,t1_fcnzzrv,1577829631.0,"**Mario Kart** is fun, you can set the game so that it's easy for your 4 y/o to play (kart drives itself)

**Mario Party** is great, though you can't use a pro-controller for that one. You'd have to play with each joycon separately. The mini games are fun and you're guaranteed to have laughs all around. 

**Yoshi's Crafted World** is another option. It's quite beautifully made and the three of you can play at once. Super kid-friendly and the controls are simple. 

If you're looking for something a little more action-packed, I would suggest maybe **Luigi's Mansion 3**. It's not at all scary and quite comical.

As someone else mentioned, **Untitled Goose Game** is very charming and you'll definitely get the approval of everyone playing. It's single player, but you can all take turns and advise the current player. Definitely take a look. It's short, though, and the replayability is rather low."

Both are farming/life simulation games. They're fairly grindy.
