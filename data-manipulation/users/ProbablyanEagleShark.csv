I would also enjoy a third route in which you bring the information to both Duty and Freedom^1 resulting in amped up war between the two, with Freedom trying to aid and help strengthen their new very much needed allies while renewed Monolith aggression threatens them at both the barrier and Yanov.(a result of their being more thinly spread) 

^1 (Doesn't necessarily have to happen this way, the stuff after this point is my big one.)

Even have some ideas on how this Total war could go. Siding with Duty could see the player trying to break the non aggression pact that the Mercenaries and Freedom have, in order to it more difficult for them to move through the Dead City to reach CS, and perhaps some larger battles (duty does think themselves a police force, of sorts) as they are harassed by bandits(and/or whoever else) while moving through Garbage. 

Siding with Freedom and Clear Sky could have the player taking efforts to increase CS's numbers, trying to wipe out the renegades, and helping to secure routes through the Dead City, Yantar, and Agroprom, perhaps with a sizable battle in the Wild Territory.

EscapefromTarkov,fdo9wi6,t3_elrrd6,1578601405.0,"Reading this and the other comments, here are my suggestions.

1. An additional exit for PMC's to reduce the exit camping which is not immersive or fun, perhaps depot hermetic door, but only opens to PMCs after a player scav has used it, or maybe after some scav raiders spawn, with a few hanging around.

2. Let us see the names behind the player scavs.

3. When are we gonna see randomized loot spawns Nikita? Is it .13? Please.

As for the attractiveness to player scavs, that's seems intended. Making it attractive to player scavs does 2 things. The first is that it makes the base more dangerous, especially to PMCs. The second is that it gives those players who arent good at the game a way to get the money they need to keep playing PMCs.

It's an end-game map, it's supposed to be dangerous, moreso than the other maps. Player scavs are an excellent way to do so."
