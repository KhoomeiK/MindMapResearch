I’m an avid believer of women having the right to make any decision regarding their body- without any feeling of shame or guilt. 
I was never shamed or guilted for my decision. Luckily. I’d be livid as well. Please take a moment to realize you’re only trying to pick a fight. It’s not one you’ll win, because you have a misconception of my intent and my beliefs. I kindly ask you to reconsider your judgment. We each have our own experiences, and now you’re actually shaming me for mine. There’s nothing wrong with you having experienced and felt what you had- and there is nothing wrong my experience or resulting feelings either. Thank you for supporting your beliefs, I’m right there behind you. Cheers to a common ground!"
bipolar,fesdiq7,t1_ferzw02,1579364102.0,"I had feelings of relief. Significant feelings of relief as a result of my experience. That didn’t take away the painful components of it as well. My comment was meant to build the woman who posted up, not being her down. Why would you feel the need to do that to me? I placed no negative stigma, and meant no harm. Please go pick a fight with someone who isn’t trying to help others."
