personalfinance,fbl3odt,t3_edi8wr,1576958093.0,"I would advice you dad goes for deliver service, I am an immigrant and my dad works as a delivery driver for Amazon, HEB and a company called T-force that transport blood samples between hospitals. I have tagged along with a few times when am home from college and for most of the part it is usually driving and rarely very heavy lifting. Most of the heavy lifting my dad has told me about is usually carry stuff up the stairs in the event where their is not elevator. The job also allow you to see you state even more and drive to places you likely would never go to. 
The cherry on top is itâ€™s easy to get jobs like this one cause this companies are always looking for more drivers especially amazon. Itâ€™s worth a try :)"
