30 second clips, usually. Like normal for the GOP shills on Reddit, they ignore the full context."
politics,ffw6y2v,t1_ffw5ppe,1580287201.0,"I used to browse T_D after 2016... It wasn't fun lol.  I'd find it in /all, and purposefully dive down it.

I haven't done it with conservative, but I imagine it's similar..."
politics,ffw489g,t1_ffw3hwy,1580283616.0,">I think what most liberals are missing is that this isn't about right and wrong, it's about winning and losing. I've attached my entire worldview to this man and I am going down with the ship. Not one of you is going to convince me otherwise.

You just proved Poe's law lol"
politics,ffw45b9,t1_ffw37v5,1580283516.0,Unless this announcement is for big donors to influence those wanting more witnesses with the right amount of money...
politics,ffw42hm,t1_ffw3kmb,1580283418.0,So you admit it's conniving. That they're acting in bad faith and that this is all malicious.
politics,ffw3mgm,t1_ffvrcew,1580282863.0,"He's been alienating the military. You can't have a coup without the support of the military. What he did to Mattis pissed a lot of them off. Syria too. Recent middle East too.

They're realizing he's not stable.  They [used to] respect Bolton, regardless of them attacking his character leading up to him maybe being a witness.

The long Arc of Justice..."
politics,ffw3ea1,t1_ffvs1ro,1580282588.0,"Which is exactly why they should throw him under the bus lol

They're all in: it's either the way of the whigs or it's a fascist takeover. I guess we'll find out in a year."
politics,ffw3byj,t1_ffw2xox,1580282507.0,"They're pushing this rhetoric now: https://www.reddit.com/r/joerogan/comments/emypsr/_/ffh35l4?context=1000

""Ukraine meddled."" On top of their preconceived notions that, ""because Democrats do what Trump did it excuses Trump."" Even though the conditions are completely different."
politics,ffw34aj,t1_ffw2vvk,1580282252.0,"Hillary testified for 11 hours. There were 4 Benghazi investigations.

Now they're trying to push ""Ukraine meddled"" (but her emails), there's a point when they get so wrapped up in their lies, fallacies, and stupidity that even the most ignorant (yet unbiased) voter goes, ""hold up..."""
politics,ffvv8vr,t1_ffvulu8,1580274270.0,I hope so. Cause the whole party to implode.
politics,ffvr1ga,t1_ffvq3xy,1580270856.0,"It's called a landslide vote.  If this motivates even 1-2% of Republicans to not vote, and motivates the apathetic left and independents to vote by even the same amount, you're talking about 5-10 million more votes for blue.

69.5m voted for Obama in 08.  63m for Trump (66 for Hillary).

So 62m to 67m is still a big win. Imagine if we inspire people like Obama did... I'm pretty sure that the more people get exposed to Bennie's message, the numbers could breach 70m."
politics,ffvpya0,t1_ffvpn75,1580270040.0,"I mean, I've felt similarly, but that's why we bring a landslide."
politics,ffvpw94,t1_ffvpo3z,1580269999.0,The chances of pence being complicit and easily being linked seems high.
politics,ffvpiib,t1_ffvp43k,1580269713.0,3 day old account... I love megathreads.
politics,ffvpeb2,t1_ffvp8hm,1580269630.0,"There's a big chance it won't be over before the election if they vote for new evidence and new witnesses.

Regardless of if they vote to acquit in the near future... More and more evidence will keep coming to light, and it will get worse and worse for them to control the damage."
politics,ffviqqo,t1_ffvi797,1580265069.0,"You're trying to make a point that sounds edgy, but is coming off as ignorant. You mean ""the house"" but you are trying to say this in bad faith as if the house doesn't have a ton of subpoenas waiting for judges.

They called a lot of witnesses that were blocked (obstruction) by the Trump administration."
politics,ffv4834,t1_ffufeob,1580255292.0,"May I copy this list into my notes for the future?

Edit: Thanks, kind Redditor. Not sure what I did, though..."
