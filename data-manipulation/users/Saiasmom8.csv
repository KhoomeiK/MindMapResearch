I started the end of November . Start where you are no need to go overboard with sticker and washi tape and pens get a feel for how you want to set it up and go from there!

migraine,fdesz8y,t3_ektv55,1578345966.0,"When I worked in child care/preschool i had a boss that would ask me to come in for the first 3 hours of my shift so they could get someone to cover. I lived 45 minutes away and coming in for 3 hours didn't pay my gas to get there. One morning I called in as soon as I woke up I knew it was a bad one but she insisted on me coming In. My amazing husband drove me to work I get there before the screaming kids arrive to prepare myself. I walked in and my boss said well you look just fine and your here early I'll hold off on the sub! It took 10 minutes after the first few kids arrived for me to call into the office so I could throw up needless to say the boss drug her feet and I puked on the newly shampooed carpet all the way to the bathroom. I called my husband from the bathroom and he turned around and came and got me when he walked in my boss asked why he was there he said ""to pick up my puking wife"" she argued that they had no one to cover and I couldn't go home because of licensing. my husband gathered all my belongings from there and said ""I hope you have someone to cover tomorrow and here on out for licensing purposes."" So long story long. not everyone understands and I was so lucky to have my husband to stand up for me I was kinda bummed that he got to do the quitting for me!"
migraine,fcxm0h2,t3_ejgbqh,1578066163.0,I was wondering the same thing yesterday mid day I became stupidly frustrated with every thing and the only other symptom was that my nose was sensitive and hurt. By dinner that night I was in pain! I went to bed with a headache and woke up with a bad migraine.
