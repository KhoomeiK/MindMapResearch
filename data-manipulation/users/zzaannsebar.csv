Cello,ffe25va,t3_et1hbc,1579834745.0,"Okay so as someone who is still a pretty recent college grad (2018) and was studying something unrelated to music in addition to music, in college there just is not enough time to maintain high skill levels and total dedication if you aren't making music your main priority. And there's nothing wrong with that either.

But I have to tell you, you will have more time after you graduate and that if you do want to let music back into your life, you should actually have time and energy and also hopefully money to make that happen. You may not have 8 hours a day to practice but you shouldn't need to if you want to play as a hobby. You could still make good progress/excellent maintenance with 1-2 hours day even.

To tell you the sort of situation I'm in, I graduated with a degree in music and computer science and almost went to grad school for cello performance but decided to apply for programming jobs because I didn't like the scholarships for the grad schools and didn't want to take out more loans. I was so disappointed when I was applying for jobs and even the first several months of working because I felt like I had given up on music and what fulfilling what I loved doing. But the thing is, I've learned that there is a beauty in getting to do something you enjoy as hobby where you can truly enjoy it without stressing about it. Where there isn't a ton of pressure. Doing things like playing in community orchestras or casually taking lessons or forming chamber groups is an amazing way to keep music in your life without worrying that you'll have to dedicate 8+ hours a day to be okay.

Hopefully this wasn't too rambly or anything and you can get my point. If you want to talk more about this, pm me!"

And every day when one of us gets home, they other always gets up and comes over and hugs and kisses hello usually even before jackets and shoes are off.

AskReddit,ffd40qu,t1_ffboico,1579812989.0,"I always say ""Have fun, don't die!"" or ""Good luck, don't die!"".  Regardless of the situation. Like someone says they're going to the bathroom? ""Good luck, don't die!"". Someone has to go fulfill obligation? ""Have fun, don't die!""

AskReddit,ffckqh1,t1_ffc8lfe,1579801536.0,"Absolutely agree. When my bf and I are cleaning out place, if we are splitting up rooms I always try to clean the bathrooms and make him take the kitchen. It's not that I don't like cleaning the kitchen. It's more that I know the bathrooms will not be properly clean if I don't do it. 

With bathrooms specifically, a minimum for the bathroom to be actually clean to me is: wipe down counter and reorganize counter top items, clean mirror, scrub sink and faucets and get rid of any built up scum or forming mildew, clean the entire toilet both inside the bowl and all the outside surfaces that can be reached, scrub thoroughly and rinse shower/tub/shower walls, sweep and mop floor, clean shower bath mat, and finally replace all towels. 

What happens when my bf cleans the bathroom: mirror gets wiped down, sink partially gets wiped down, toilet might get cleaned on the inside, he might sweep. For a pretty disgusting room, that is just not enough."

AskReddit,ffabcry,t1_ff91oc6,1579731571.0,"I have to disagree with the instagram and snapchat. 

I like snapchat because it's a fun but nicely informal way to keep in touch with people or share things happening. I have a lot of friends I live hours away from that we don't necessarily have anything to just talk about (ie talk on the phone or texting) but we will send random snaps throughout the day. It's nice to casually keep in touch with people when it can be so informal and also not expect responses. Like I can send some friends a random snap of whatever is happening, which is both more interesting and less committal than texting ""Sup"" or ""Hey how's it going"" when in reality, you don't really want a conversation. You just want an interaction. 

And instagram is what you make it. My instagram feed is like 99% cats and I'm okay with that. It brings a positive light to my life and I don't see anything wrong with that. You see the content you choose (mostly) and if you're following influencers and celebrities and it's making you sad or anxious or angry, you need to change that. But it's not only the app's fault."

AskReddit,ffa9f23,t1_ff9n6qc,1579730457.0,"It's so hard. 

I think a good visualization for someone who doesn't have ADHD to try to imagine what it's like is this: each thought you have is a post-it note. When you're trying to talk or tell a story, you're picking up these post-it notes and reading them. But when you have ADHD, not only are there many many more post-its than normal, you can see any of the writing on them until you've already picked it up and read it. So trying to tell a story is almost frantically picking up and reading every post it note trying to get all the info you need, but you can't tell which ones you do need because all the post its look at same until it's too late. 

That trying to make a visualization for the endless number of thoughts and little to no ability to distinguish which ones are relevant or necessary until afterwards."
AskReddit,ffa91ut,t1_ffa01py,1579730252.0,"Yes exactly! Like I do get a little sad when I realize that music isn't as big a part of my life as I anticipated it would be, but I get to enjoy every moment of it now and can be selective about what I do instead of having to say yes to any and every opportunity. 

A great example is the last four years, I've gotten to play for The Nutcracker with my city's orchestra and ballet (city where I grew up and went to college - great and professional production). I have shared a stand with my old teacher and she has said basically every year I've done it that she wouldn't do it if she didn't really need the money. I'm just so psyched to get to to it at all and absolutely love it. Would probably do it even if it wasn't a paid gig. (Maybe my tune would change if I had been doing it 20+ years but who knows). But the fact that I have a choice of if I want to with literally no financial repercussions is pretty amazing. Plus I have a new boss this year who let me work remotely so I got paid for work during the day and paid for the performances at night for some of my favorite music in the world. That's a win/win to me!

Also, isn't it nice being able to afford the supplies you need? I probably don't need an instrument as nice as the one I have but I absolutely freaking love that I do have it and it makes me so happy that it's mine."
AskReddit,ff9wjlp,t1_ff983ii,1579723058.0,"In school I studied computer science and music. I was really unsure about what career path to take because I was honestly pretty miserable in school with my comp sci classes and just did not get them like a lot of the other students, but I was and am an excellent musician. I had decided to audition for grad schools for music and also decided I would only go if I got a full ride + stipend. I got into several schools with some scholarships but they weren't as good as I liked so I decided not to go and to look for programming jobs instead.

I'm more than a year into being a web developer and getting to play in a community orchestra and keep music as a hobby and I'm pretty certain it was the right choice. Music gets to be almost exclusively enjoyable now instead of stressful like it was in the midst of school and auditions. I get to have a job that I don't hate/find rewarding (for the most part lol) and financially supports my hobbies. I don't have to give up nights and weekends for gigs to hope I can pay rent or put food on the table. I know I have very good job security. I was so disappointed at first and sometimes I get sad I didn't choose to go down the music career path, but I still think it was the right choice."
AskReddit,ff9vwdh,t1_ff9tmfx,1579722660.0,"Although I effectively agree with you for most of your points, I think it needs to be reinforced that you don't have to be productive all the time and in fact is very unhealthy to think that. I say that as someone who feels guilty almost every time I relax.

People need down time. People need to be able to relax doing something they enjoy regardless of if it's productive or not as long as it is not all-consuming for time or completely replacing any active tasks. So if you work 8+ hours in the day and go work out and then go home and have some time before bed, you should not feel the need to have to do something productive. You should feel okay if you just want to relax at the end of the day. It depends a lot on your mental state and mental health, but always being ""on"", so to speak, can be so hard on you long term and cause more issues than it helps even if you are being productive. 

The point I'm trying to get at is that people shouldn't feel bad for relaxing if they've already been doing stuff. Sometimes, you need a whole day or more to do nothing. That's the entire point of a lot of vacations too. Sometimes it can be too mentally taxing to always try to be productive and it leaves you drained in other aspects of your life because you haven't given yourself a chance to take a break and recharge."
AskReddit,ff9tduo,t1_ff958ax,1579720848.0,Honest question for anyone who might know: would raising the minimum wage affect jobs where you need a degree? So like say minimum wage gets raised to $20. There are currently plenty of people out there working jobs that they needed a 4 year degree from a university to get and they did it largely because they'd be making more money. Would raising minimum wage affect other wages? Would it have an affect of how many people go on to higher education?
bigboobproblems,ff9gpg2,t1_ff6m8s4,1579712642.0,"Please please please yes! Or hell, I wish I could do a body scan and send in the data and have a bra literally made for my body.

AskReddit,ff9fxkl,t1_ff9f5jt,1579712168.0,"It can be frustrating on both ends. The way I've described the feeling and experience when I can tell I'm talking too much is like I'm a ghost who has floated out of my own body and I can see myself just keep going but I have no way to stop myself. It's a really terrible and strong compulsion to say anything and everything you think and feels like you are absolutely going to burst if you don't get it out of your head. 

And about your coworker, he may realize. The biggest way to tell is if you gently remind him you've heard a story before or he interrupts, try to let him know. If he doesn't care, he's just an asshole. If he tries to make it better or improve or at least becomes more aware, he might have either not realized or realizes and feels like I do and has no idea how to control it. I really have to reiterate that it is INCREDIBLY difficult to control. It can also be difficult to understand if you do not have the condition.

But also, meditation is always tricky. One of the main points of ADHD is that you don't really have control of your thoughts and that sitting and just thinking (or trying not to) can be psychologically painful. So for me, I've been trying to practice meditation in some form or another for years and I can honestly say with a lot of disappointment that it either hasn't worked or hasn't helped. I think after a few years of practice, I'm at about 5ish seconds of uninterrupted thought. That's it. It hasn't gotten any better than that in years and I've tried tons of different methods. 

Another part of the issue is that it is a developmental and chemical issue. It's like telling a person with clinical depression to think happy thoughts or a person with anxiety not to worry. It is well intentioned but such a bigger issue than it seems."
AskReddit,ff9a2h5,t1_ff8k4gf,1579708281.0,"> If you keep getting interrupted and no one prods you to continue (""anyways, what were you saying?"") then honestly, you were most likely boring and they were attempting to change the subject. 

It hurts but you are 100% right. It can be so hard to tell sometimes though, because I absolutely know I can talk too much. But thinking specifically about when I'm at work, I also have coworkers who I can not get a word in edge-wise or contribute to conversations. I think the really big difference in why I get interrupted and he doesn't is because his stories are much more interesting and engaging. 

I want to try practicing my story telling, but one issue I've ran into is that I don't remember these stories until they pop back in my head when someone says something. There are only a few stories I remember and have the words/timing down to because I've told them a bunch and I know they're actually funny and entertaining (based on the reactions). But my memory is pretty terrible and the moment I try to actively think of stories to try to practice, \*poof\* they're gone.

Thank you though, I really do appreciate the advice and am taking it to heart."

AskReddit,ff8h4rw,t1_ff864p4,1579678253.0,"I need to learn your ways. My ADHD really terribly gets in the way of verbal story telling. In my mind, I have about a thousand technically relevant details related to whatever I'm talking about but I have absolutely no ability to distinguish which details are important, relevant, and interesting (pick at least two). Those things I figure out after I've either just finished telling the story and realized it was unnecessarily long-winded and boring or I've managed to practice telling that story enough that it isn't a jumped and run-on sentence interrupted by other run-on sentences thoughts.

But it seems no matter how much I try to be mindful of what things are good to include in a story, if I don't plow full speed ahead and just keep talking until I get it out all, whether the words are truly important or not, I just get interrupted instead."

Those dreams are always wild though. But I think the weirdest part is I never feel panicked or anxious during or after them. More like ""Huh well that was weird.""

Edit: Actually going to give an example of a more notable dream I remember that was a combo of both. 

So the the first part of the dreams was me and some friends or whatever people running from these evil elves/fairy tale creates. I remember it being an old castle ruin, deep in the woods. There was moss on the ground and growing over the old bricks. I specifically remember how deep the green of the surrounding was and how if we weren't getting chased by things, it would have been a really cool place. 

We ran through the woods or something and found this house and ran inside and escaped our pursuers. This house had a basement that was like a 50s diner. There were red leather booths and checkered floors. It was a long and semi-narrow space and at the end, there was a set of doors that led to a theater where a comedy show was going to happen. I remember my bf was there with me and I wanted to find our seats for the show but he wanted to eat first. I got mad that we were probably going to be late (only part of the dream that made me anxious lol) but sat down to eat anyway.

But then there were these new creatures that appeared. One came from the theater area so I tried running up the stairs from the basement and there was this thing in the stairwell. It had the body that looked kind of like a scarecrow meets a manquein. But it's face was covered with a piece of lined notebook paper that has been torn to be face-shaped and the eyes and mouth were drawn on in yellow highlighter. The eyes were just small circles and the mouth was a straight slit so it basically looked like :| 

It started to lunge for me so I hit it and the body flew down the stairs. Then I started to race up the stairs but could see the paper fly off the face and start to chase me. About the only thing I remember after that is running down the hall trying to escape the evil paper and then I woke up."

So it's recommended by professionals that after a while of not being able to fall asleep, get up and out of your room and do some non-stimulating task. Like reading or drawing or listen to a podcast or something but do it not in bed. Do this for a bit then try to go to bed again.

AskReddit,fegtdrq,t1_fegrzum,1579102099.0,"Have you gotten checked out by a sleep specialist before? I would try to make an appointment if you can. If you always wake up exhausted, the most common cause is sleep apnea which can be deadly. I commented under the person you replied to in a different common with some more info."
AskReddit,fegtafl,t1_fegruxo,1579102039.0,"That doesn't necessarily mean they're sleeping too much though. Sleep cycles are about 90 minutes (varies person to person but this is the avg) so getting 7.5 or 9 hours would be ending with a completed cycle. So if they get 8 hours of sleep, they may wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle and be tired. But they could also get 9 hours of sleep and feel better because they didn't interrupt the cycle. 

But if waking up exhausted is a constant issue, it's more likely a sleep disorder than just a bad amount of sleep. One of the most common sleep disorders that makes you feel just awful when you wake up is sleep apnea because your body is constantly actually waking up through the night because you stop breathing in your sleep. If you are: a man, overweight, snore, have a large neck, smoke, have diabetes, chronic nasal congestion, or a history of sleep apnea, you are more at risk for it and should get checked out by a professional. Sleep apnea can be deadly."

Sometimes I can feel that it's bad in that moment for whatever I'm doing and sometimes can pull myself out of the distracted and compulsive spiral but sometimes I can't.

I do notice how much worse the distraction and scatter brainedness and mental chaos are without meds than with. My bf definitely notices as well.

Going to uni under a different major but taking private lessons and playing in the school's orchestra, getting a minor (or secondary emphasis or however that system works), take lessons and play in community orchestras. At this point, you're just not going to be ready to be thrown into a music major. They're intense and most places expect an advanced level of playing to get in. 

However, you do not need a degree in music to have a career in music. Of course it helps, but often times it isn't 100% necessary. Just like another commenter, my city's symphony is made up largely of people who have been playing forever but who don't have their primary career in music. There's a lot of teachers and bankers and lawyers and programmers etc. A lot of symphonies in smaller cities or at least less major orchestras are accommodating for people who have day jobs outside of music. It's not uncommon at all.

And then when we tried putting on subtitles, she freaked out about them. So we turned them off and turned the volume up. Finally after only getting 15 minutes into the film over the course of 30 minutes, we finally paused it and told her that we can't watch it if she keeps talking.

I spent countless hours in my teachers and ta's office hours getting help to actually understand the material and not get too far behind.

I think the only reason I got good grades in high school is because I'm smart and still put in a decent amount of work.

""Covered"" by insurance is pretty subjective nowadays. Like for me, I have a high deductible plan so the cost of the visits are added to my deductible because I chose a provider that is in-network.

The medications and prices vary wildly between plans and formularies and pharmacies. So for me, my adderall for a 30 day supply of 20mg is about $35 (have to pay out of pocket until I hit my deductible). But if you get prescribed vyvannse, it's over $300. There's also a non-stimulant ADHD med called Strattera that looks to be about $80. But these prices would be if you don't have a copay plan.

I go through waves of either extreme energy or extreme lethargy. If I'm energetic already and not on meds, it's very unfocused energy. Like I could bounce from deep cleaning my kitchen to practicing piano to finally getting around to redecorating my office and do all of that in like an hour. I can actually manage those impulses and chaotic and energetic thoughts into productive and metered things with medication which is really nice. I always notice my phone battery is drained a lot faster when I'm not on meds because I'm constantly googling things and looking things up and online shopping and texting everyone I know.

AskReddit,fdd0r5s,t1_fdcy7wa,1578290266.0,Basically same. I don't even like sleeping under a comforter because it feels like it presses me down too much. I prefer the lightest throw blankets I can manage. I think a weighted blanket may actually send me into a panic attack

AskReddit,fdcr41b,t1_fdclj5g,1578281964.0,"Finding a private psychiatry or psychotherapy office is probably the easiest way to go. There's usually a couple month waiting period for new patients but it's not the end of the world. Otherwise you can get a referral to a psychiatrist through your primary care doctor. Has to be a psychiatrist though because they're the only ones who can prescribe meds.

The psych will either administer a test to see if you have ADHD or just have a conversation with you and ask some questions. It was the second case for me and it was a surprisingly chill interaction but has been life changing to actually be medicated."

I had read about almost all those groups but with varying amounts of info. I haven't been able to find much info for the Bearded Company because their website is under construction and they don't have any events listed on their Facebook page. But I'll try to check them out when they get some info up. Thanks!"
AskReddit,fcyw1a0,t1_fcw3nei,1578088319.0,"I do not know why, but this is one of my all time least favorite books. Maybe it's because I had to read it over a summer vacation for my AP Language and Composition class in high school, or maybe it's because I don't particularly like heavy handed biblical references. But this book was a terrible chore to get through. It is also one of the few books I've ever thrown away. People have tried to explain why they liked the book but I just cannot see it. The only character I found moderately interesting was Kathy (I think that was her name?) but she alone was not enough to keep my interest."
AskReddit,fcyv2hr,t1_fcwv1cq,1578087710.0,"Have you read it in both English and Spanish? I'm curious because I took Spanish for 5 or so years and did a study abroad in Spain so I was close to fluent and have lot of a lot of my speaking ability. But I'm curious how the book reads in Spanish vs English. I feel like I'd probably get more out of it in English because I'd miss things in Spanish, but I also feel like reading something in the original language has a different presentation and power than a translation, even if it's a good one."

gatekeeping,fcxkskj,t1_fcwwodp,1578065348.0,"Can't stand it when people do that. When I worked at a coffee shop in college, the manager was TERRIBLE about this.

I am a very tired person. Basically all the time and have been for 10 years about now. When I would have to do the 6:30am shift at the shop, which for a college student already sucks a lot but it was always on a Saturday, I would come in bleary-eyed and super tired. She would always tell me that ""I have to come in early every day. If I'm not tired from getting up at 5am every day, then you can't be tired. Get over it.""

Oh thank you, you heartless keto-cunt. I have a few medical conditions including a sleep disorder that mess me up. You are probably not more tired than me and this isn't a contest. It's me being sick of being told I shouldn't be tired because I'm young or because other people have it worse."
