bonecollecting,ffe1ddk,t1_ffe1904,1579834171.0,Going by the size it's more likely to be the whitetail deer? But definitely wait for someone more experienced to show up.
bonecollecting,ffe120o,t1_ffe0jhe,1579833939.0,"I have no idea. What I read just said a bunch of animals had been extirpated from the area, meaning local extinction. The area apparently used to have wolves, badgers, wolverines, martens, cougars, lynx, moose, bison and a type of rat. Didn't say when they were driven out though. I'm not too good at to be ID, I was just mentioning the animals it could be."
bonecollecting,ffe06h8,t1_ffdykc7,1579833306.0,I looked it up and apparently you've got elk and whitetail deer. And the area used to have moose and bison.
haworthia,ffdp4q2,t1_ffdfymn,1579825643.0,Adding that to make sure it's a lower case u.
succulents,ffdk2xb,t1_ffd2moz,1579822550.0,"I don't know about everywhere, but all the places near me have pest/fungal issues. I just spend some time going over any plants I'm interested in and look for any abnormalities. Then if I do take any home I immediately repot them, remove as much nursery soil as I can, and give the plant a scrub with warm water and dish soap. Then they stay in another room for quarantine until I'm sure they're clean. I may be a bit paranoid but I and my plant friends have a lot of trouble and these are our only sources, so we take all precautions. I do suggest to at least replace the nursery soil and keep them separate from your collection for 1-2 weeks."
houseplants,ffdi3w2,t1_ffdcwte,1579821341.0,"And they're very forgiving. This one got a touch of root rot a few months ago and barely showed it, I wouldn't've known if I wasn't repotting it. And I often forget to water it. It's more sturdy than my pothos was."
houseplants,ffd95sj,t1_ffd7rza,1579815863.0,"Thanks! The first 3 photos have 2 months in-between them, and the last was taken yesterday, a year later."
RATS,ffax7wy,t1_ff9rhy3,1579746589.0,Do you cook it or feed it raw? Or does it matter...
bonecollecting,ff7krhy,t1_ff7k9zl,1579651884.0,"I thought I recognized it, I've got lots of family around Baddeck, Goose cove and Englishtown, it's a gorgeous place."

Beautiful skull btw"
MandelaEffect,ff467j6,t1_ff45ud5,1579556427.0,"It bothers me because I have this vivid memory, As I type, I can picture the character with her creepy smile forming the words to ""I will survive"", I can hear her voice saying the words... But I cannot find any video proof such as a directors cut where she sings anything other than ""holding out for a hero""."
cats,ff2bx1r,t1_ff2b0s6,1579500096.0,"It's a left over behaviour from kittenhood. Kittens who are nursing from their mother will ""knead"" her teats to help the milk express. Adult cats continue this behaviour as it reminds them of being close to their mother and siblings, and gives them a feeling of comfort. Some cats will even suckle on fabric if the feeling is intense enough. I've even seen this behaviour in dogs, though it's usually because they were taken from their mother too soon."
cats,ff2bhhq,t1_ff2arpe,1579499664.0,Is it all human voices or just one gender? Some cats are nervous/scared of a certain genders voice. I've seen it in cats who weren't even abused so there seemed to be no reason.
AskScienceDiscussion,ff25f6s,t1_ff248l8,1579494306.0,"I know that it is fiction, it's a movie. I wanted to know what would happen to our planet and it's life if our cores actually reversed direction. I could imagine that everything will be fine or that we'll burst into flames or pass into another dimension. I want to know what actually would happen. I can see how it may not technically be possible, but surely someone can hypothesize what might happen? After all, there are many absurd questions answered for the sake of pure interest or humor."

bonecollecting,ff0zkwf,t3_eqwsfx,1579473775.0,"What is the skull above the one with the elastic on it? The ridges on top of the head seem more defined than the other domestic cats, is it from a bigger breed something? Or is it male?"
RATS,ff0wxgq,t3_equiu0,1579473070.0,"So, so cute! How old?"
bonecollecting,ff0tm9a,t1_ff0skl7,1579472166.0,"That's pretty cool.

Keep up the great work!"
bonecollecting,ff0ng9w,t1_ff0naa6,1579470550.0,Does it ever lose it's colour? I've only ever handled sphagnum moss so I have no idea.
