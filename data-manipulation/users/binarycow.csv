Militaryfaq,ffr0vjc,t1_ffqz27k,1580148001.0,"Well. Depending on the temperature, wind chill, etc..... 

If it's not too cold, I'd wear silks, short sleeve, long sleeve, and pt jacket. Then silks and pants. Decent gloves, and balaclava. I would stay inside as long as possible, then get moving with PT ASAP. once you start moving, that gear is probably enough. 

But if it was REALLY cold (like, below -15)...  I'd follow the manual for, and wear, the ECWCS.

If it's cold enough that the temperature and wind chill warrant wearing ECWCS, but your unit leadership wants you to wear APFU, then i have to question your leadership's judgement. Fort drum considers -16 and below (ambient and/or wind chill) to be medium risk and needs BN CDR approval.... Specifically, the BN CDR needs to enforce a proper cold weather pt uniform."

Militaryfaq,ffquodv,t3_eumq1y,1580144047.0,"Take your layers off (one at a time) when you get warm, but BEFORE you sweat.

If you have sweaty skin, NEVER expose it to the air until you're INSIDE.

Don't wear any cold weather gear inside a climate controlled building. NONE.

If your nose runs, pat it dry, ASAP.

If you wear glasses. Make sure your neck gaiter/mask/etc doesn't push moist air from your mouth behind your glasses.

Drink water, but keep it inside your body - DON'T SWEAT. If you're sweating, you are wearing too many layers. If you're an unfortunate soul who sweats when running, no matter what, just don't expose the sweat to the cold air.

Prefer lots of thin layers vs thicker ones.

Wear what you need to in order to stay warm. If you're being ridiculed, fuck 'em. If your chain of command is telling you not to wear gloves/beanie, etc when it's fucking cold outside, open door policy that shit. (do note that they may just be trying to acclimate you)

Stay safe. The child will fucking kill you.

Don't run alone. Don't run in the dark.

Watch for cars who can't stop... (either ice or visibility) They WILL hit you.

If your clothes are wet, take them off. If you don't have anything to replace it with, or it's too cold to take off, get inside and warm up / dry off.

Moisture wicking is good. Get moisture away from your skin."

But. It is possible to have a facial structure that causes or contributes to apnea. My pulmonologist took one look at my throat and said ""yep, that's why you have sleep apnea, you have a small throat.""
