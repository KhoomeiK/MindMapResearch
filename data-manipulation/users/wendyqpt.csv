Hopefully there will be an owner later on who will apologize or let you know what happened but if they choose not to tell you, we need to understand too."

My husband surprised me the same way\~  I was home alone due to working different shifts than him and one day he surprised me saying I should request half day OFF because we needed to drive 4 hours to pick our corgi up. 

Eddie's been a challenge due to his personality but it fits right with us, we're also weird like any Austin local lol but he has improved our life, now we don't think about us only but we need to take care of our four legged family member and we laugh at any new thing he learns.  When my stepson comes for the holidays, they give each other company and that's just perfect! +
