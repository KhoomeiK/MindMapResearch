IAmA,ffckf5c,t3_esv0c0,1579801342.0,"I would like to hear your opinion on the grooming of Ghislaine Maxwell, probably the first grooming victim?  I understand that grooming can cross all relationship barriers.  I personally do not believe she would undertake a recruiting role without first being normalised to Epstein's sexual preferences, and believing she was doing right by him.  She would lose all perspective of right and wrong.  Do you have an opinion on this?  Have professional mental health specialists commented on this?

 I do not condone her actions, she should have stepped out long before she did, but I think the situation is more complicated than we would like to believe."

I don't imagine a bunch of guys, 40 years later, commenting about the look of one pair of knickers during a pose.  I think wtf get over it.  Eat some pussy your own age.  If you can get it."

ImGoingToHellForThis,ff9d4zp,t3_esd70u,1579710371.0,"This is something we have to watch out for in Australia as immigration continues.  Atm domestic violence is big in Indian born communities (as well as Aus born), there are cultural issues that need to be addressed.  Conservative Muslim men see  Western girls and women as sluts just because of their fashion and behavioural freedom.
Indian wives in arranged marriages can be abused by their husbands and his family for not living up to expectations, they don't realise there is support for them here if they need to get away.  Not all related to post I apologise, but needs to be said."

HumansBeingBros,fekdk4k,t1_fekabrr,1579197801.0,"Those early days are the worst.  Having a project with time out for crying is the best way to cope.  Also, it allows you to sleep.  

Sending OP much love. When all the noise quietens down, share everything with your loved one, no matter how weird it seems.  Pulling away to keep pain to yourself only makes relationships harder."

 Warren is still a bit too left but a better bet than Bernie.  If democrats really want to beat Trump, they need to go more Centrist to get the numbers.  Sometimes you have to shovel a pile of shit to prevent a huge truckload being dumped on you."

AskReddit,fee7755,t3_eonzr0,1579027816.0,"You adopt them as your 'person behind the scenes.  They are the details person to your big picture.  Your first lady with the brains to your president.  You compliment each other with your  skills but connect with your humour or philosophy.  

Don't call them out in public, never share their secrets, let them control their own flow of information.   Don't be offended when they say they are hanging out alone.  They're not pushing you away, or hanging with others, they just like their own space."
CasualUK,fee6irn,t3_eoodoe,1579027418.0,"I'm middle aged, I  put my bag on the seat next to me (if I score a double) because my bag is usually heavy and I want to relax. I don't pay too much attention to the train filling up but if someone pauses next to me, I put it on my lap without thinking.  I expect the same response in return when I take a seat.  

Please don't presume a woman is being possessive of the seat because she put her bag there.  Many of us just want to flop and deal with other passengers as we have to."

 Especially a stranger.  You don't know if they've been watching you for days before they said something. They might get off at your stop.  Not everyone is a douche.  Some people don't think rationally."
