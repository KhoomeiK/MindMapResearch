Any time there are multiple varieties distinguished solely by the perforations or lack thereof, and one variety is significantly more valuable than the others, you should assume that a stamp purporting to be the more valuable variety has been altered, until proven otherwise by a recognized expertizer."

Yeah, this is frequently the case.

I think the most significant part is that not everybody gets a vote.  You have to meet age, usage and karma requirements in order to qualify.  And when you get moderator access you only get five points, and they expire after a few days if you don't use them.  

This weeds out most of the spammers and other bad actors from the voting pool, eliminates brigading and snowballing of votes, and creates a strong incentive for moderators to use their votes where they count, since you only get a handful of votes, and you don't know when you're going to get more.
