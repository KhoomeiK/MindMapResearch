AbandonedPorn,ff69ijp,t3_erw6nn,1579622284.0,How could this possibly be abandoned.  I want to live there.
FoodPorn,feywppy,t1_feyuopb,1579451482.0,Me too.
dogs,feywo6x,t1_feyvz4u,1579451465.0,"Rescues aren’t all special needs.  My Harry has all of his faculties and then some.  He was just a stray.  Actually, I spend less on him than my friends spend on their dogs because he is so healthy.  I didn’t have to spend much on training either because he had already been trained.  He already knew how to walk on a leash and socialize with other dogs and people."
dogs,feyogqo,t3_eqqymu,1579448278.0,"The best breed is a rescue.  Mixed breeds are generally healthy and live longer.  My local shelter matched me to my buddy, an English pointer/terrier mix.  He was three and had the manners of a real gentleman.  He was totally housebroken from the first day.  He has been a very good companion who has traveled the country with me many times.  He is ten now and I hope that he will stay with me for many more years."
dogs,feewjiw,t3_eorzbk,1579042750.0,"I apologize if this seems inappropriate here.  But, I’m wondering what she plans to do with the pups that aren’t up to standard."
dogs,feevfj2,t3_eosfxa,1579042062.0,"I think he is either sick or, more likely, scared."
dogs,feb1em2,t3_eoavj1,1578954498.0,"I’m sorry, I would be more blunt.  Tell her that, based on her past actions, she is too selfish to be in control of a smaller, vulnerable being that cannot speak up for itself.  Remind her that if she neglects it, that it might eventually hurt the children.  Kids are rough on animals."
drawing,feaxso1,t3_eo8pyd,1578953318.0,"I love your ballon girl.  More, more!"
dogs,fea2zwq,t3_enyc3s,1578943823.0,"Hmm.  I get the same complaints here in Florida.  In my housing development, all grassy area are common areas.  No one owns the land around their home.  Still, they complain about dogs walking on the grass and peeing and pooping.  I don’t walk close to their homes and always pick up the poop.  Here is my thought...... I wonder if they know that all the birds, squirrels, raccoons and other wild animals are peeing and pooping all over the place.  Sometimes I wonder if folks use dog complaints as an excuse to bully."
dogs,fe9yczw,t3_eo51pl,1578942572.0,Why don’t you take care of him for your sister?
dogs,fe9vh2m,t3_eo7wc2,1578941798.0,"In your original post, you said he leaves them alone for 10 to 12 hours a day and lets them out in his fenced back yard for 15 minutes at least twice a day.  Doesn’t sound like neglect.  I think many working people do this.  Also, I think Great Danes are not a breed that need a lot of exercise.  I think it would be very wise to let him be."
dogs,fe8xq9j,t3_eo0437,1578932129.0,My dog does it too.  I’m starting to suspect that he wants to eat with me.
dogs,fe8vf51,t3_eo5ud3,1578931454.0,"I totally agree.  I walk with a large walking stick. When they come at my Harry, I put the stick down hard, look them in the eye and yell no. I too, have high anxiety because of this.  I have noticed that most of the offending owners have large dogs."
drawing,fdrm9ca,t3_emnkck,1578686479.0,Wow. You really put in the work and it paid off.
dogs,fdlnnck,t3_em0198,1578528136.0,"It sounds like you are doing great, especially with the walking.  Routine is everything with a rescue.  It calms them to know what to expect.  

One idea.  Even though my older rescue has perfect manners, I don’t let him roam the whole house when I’m out.  I make sure he has water and food and I shut him in the bedroom.  He usually just sleeps and I leave the tv on for company.  Also, I have neighbors that are willing to go over and take him out for a quick front yard pee if I get held up.  Last, I have a sticker on my front door that informs firemen and police that there is a dog in the home."
drawing,fdk25tu,t3_elsozc,1578494205.0,Looks beautiful.  Looks like the light is below her chin.
drawing,fdi5jxn,t3_eliexg,1578436120.0,Totally get it.  Be brave.
drawing,fd9pgcv,t3_ekdlgo,1578236341.0,Great Lucy drawing.
drawing,fd9c4p6,t3_ek302i,1578231383.0,"I just started with mechanical pencil too.  Finally, I wanted to make my sketches less cartoony, and get them to pop off the page.  so I graduated to sketch pencils and use stumps to blend and I’ve ordered an electric fine point eraser to get those tiny highlights.  Good luck.  That’s beautiful work for a mechanical pencil."
