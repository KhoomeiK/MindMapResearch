bipolar,fe2dqfk,t1_fdxe28y,1578837234.0,"Do you have a drug that helps you sleep? I have trazadone for regular insomnia and saphris for manic insomnia. I find that if I am able to get a couple of good nights' sleep, the scary symptoms go away, but I still feel good and Feel All The Things. After feeling nothing for two years after my first awful manic episode, I will never take that for granted again.

I think of it as a positive feedback loop. Sleeping less makes me more manic, which makes me sleep less, which....

It sounds like you're handling it well and finding healthy outlets for the mania. And have a support system that will recognize danger when you can't. Good for you, and enjoy being happy again!"
bipolar,fe2cizx,t3_enm3nl,1578836835.0,Trazadone gives me very vivid dreams. Lucid dreaming is a real thing.... Check it out.
bipolar,fe2c3gl,t3_enjkrb,1578836774.0,"I think Bipolar II is sometimes just Bipolar I that is caught and treated before a full blown manic episode happens. 

Manic episodes are terrible, awful, life-changing (in a very bad way) things. 

It sounds like you may need your meds adjusted, though. Talk to your doctor! Or see a different one if you think your current one isn't being aggressive enough."
bipolar,fe2a7jl,t1_fe002uy,1578836185.0,"I've never done cocaine, but my mania (sometimes) feels like I imagine illegal stimulants feel."
bipolar,fe29vij,t1_fe1hlum,1578836034.0,"You are strong, and you will get through this. As demonstrated by the fact that you've made it through everything else that life has thrown your way! Your medical team is there to help you, and don't be afraid to seek further medicinal help if needed.

Best of luck in the court proceedings."
bipolar,fe29aum,t3_encbw8,1578835886.0,"Same. I used to joke about it, and a couple of my friends suggested I had it. In a concerned friendly way.

Then I went full blown manic and ended up involuntarily in a psych ward for 2 weeks, diagnosed with Bipolar i. Blew up my own life and hurt some people close to me very badly.

I wish someone had pushed me to see a doctor a bit. One friend did, and I promised her I would after exams were over. And before exams were over... See above.

So my response when someone says that is to go dead serious and tell them (part of)my story. And say that if they aren't willing to discuss it with a doctor, then misdiagnosis is extremely dangerous for themselves and those they love. And claiming to have it when you actually don't is hurtful to those who do.

Bipolar, manic/mania, and depression/depressed/depressing do all have valid uses in the English language besides describing mental health, though. I too prefer ""manic depression."" Most people have a decent idea of what depression is. Mania is much less well understood or even recognizable to the general population."
