depression,fexscwv,t3_eqs4h8,1579435386.0,"Agree. Especially in today's era of self-help & motivational BS, people often are into blind optimism & positivity. Human beings simply just want to hope, dream, and be happy. But reality is cruel, harsh, unfair, boring, and depressing (unless if you're lucky)."
depression,fexrz2o,t1_fewgy0i,1579435212.0,Some people's lives get worse and never get better. It's just the harsh truth & reality.
SuicideWatch,fendypu,t3_epwvfr,1579282635.0,Welcome to reality..
SuicideWatch,fendy7s,t1_femdn0x,1579282626.0,I also can relate with this..
SuicideWatch,felkdvx,t3_epkr5t,1579224279.0,"I also feel & think the same, so I can relate too. I think there is a study & proven research that smarter people often have what's called an existential depression (or existential crisis). It's usually for people who think & feel deeply, or much more deeper. Because contrary to the popular opinions, the truth will NOT set you free. But instead, when you know the deeper truth about this world, life, society, existence, reality, etc etc, it is depressing. Very depressing actually (and not to mention that the reality is also boring, mundane, unfair, limiting, and yes, reality is also shitty, Life sucks). 

Existential depression is also much more rare (it's not the typical depression that can be cured simply by meds, therapy, etc etc), because, well, most people just don't like to think. In fact, to be very honest, I've found that most or majority of people are ignorant, naive, unrealistic, shallow, simple-minded (usually in their blind optimism/positivity & happiness), and honestly speaking, most people are just stupid."
SuicideWatch,fdltbx8,t3_elu4me,1578532006.0,"I'm 37 years old guy from Indonesia, and I can relate. I feel like a loser & useless failure completely/totally. I'm sorry that even I also still don't know what to do to get better. Life is shit. At least I just want to let you know that you're not alone in feeling & thinking like that, if it helps somewhat."
depression,fcvxcf6,t3_ej1l29,1578012237.0,"This will sound cliche, but I'm serious when I said that I can relate to most of the things that you've said. And I don't know how old are you, but I myself am a 37 years old man (I'm from Indonesia). My only question for now is: so you don't have suicidal thoughts/fantasy? Because I do, and to be honest, it's getting quite often as I get older. Because, like you, I've finally come to the same conclusion too that this world/society/life/reality/existence (whatever you want to call it) is boring/mundane, stupid, pointless/meaningless, & depressing. I feel (& think) there is no point anymore to just keep living/surviving everyday, every damn year, just for this shitshow and hellhole."
SuicideWatch,fcphdmk,t3_eieayu,1577864137.0,"It's already 1st January 2020 here in Jakarta, Indonesia. I wish I was brave enough to really commit suicide on New Year's Eve, when the clock was at 00:00:00. But unfortunately, I'm also just a spineless pathetic coward useless failure & loser as usual."
antinatalism,fcph7l6,t1_fco7kgu,1577863911.0,"Same, only that I'm 37 yrs old. Fuck this boring, stupid, & depressing reality/life/society/world/existence."
antinatalism,fcgy7zn,t3_eh5s3m,1577645256.0,"Family is selfish? No, Human beings are selfish (by nature)."
antinatalism,fca74pz,t3_egqq99,1577564048.0,"Because honestly most people are selfish, ignorant, stupid, shallow, & simple-minded in their optimism/positivity. But first & foremost, people are selfish. It's human nature to think only about themselves first, before even any other person. 

So that's why when a person is lucky enough to have his/her life all in order, he/she will quickly (& happily, of course) spout out such selfish statement: ""Hey, cheer up, Life is a gift!"".

Without caring nor even thinking about (many) other people/Humans who are not as lucky/fortunate, eg: people born in poverty/poor conditions/circumstances, terminal illness, war-stricken countries, terrors, etc etc. 

They naively & simply think that EVERYONE must be happy (& lucky/fortunate), and therefore must appreciate Life, & all other stupid, idiotic bullshits like that."
depression,fc6wrpx,t3_egdm43,1577491493.0,"I'm 37, so it's much worse for me. That's why I often now have suicidal thoughts."
Anxiety,fc501c7,t3_eg62xd,1577436134.0,Yes I can relate too
SuicideWatch,fc4zzqk,t3_eg359h,1577436068.0,Could it be an FWP (first-world problem) ?
depression,fc44qjq,t3_efzyy9,1577406592.0,"Life is not fair. Some people are lucky, some people are not. And reality is depressing (unless if you're lucky)."
SuicideWatch,fc44k3o,t3_efyam6,1577406460.0,Well I'm 37 with nothing. So you can imagine how much worse it is for me. I often have suicidal thoughts/fantasy now.
