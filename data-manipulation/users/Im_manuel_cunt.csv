gatekeeping,fg0m2o2,t3_ew5yuj,1580410524.0,I have been literally lectured by the people about the topics they never actually saw personally my 2hole life.
funny,fg0kra4,t3_ew8ir3,1580409779.0,Yeah and the other one isn't a mask.
BreadTube,fg0cr4c,t1_fg09p05,1580405055.0,"This a common discussion about the topic. If you are the enemy of the left for an example, you can stop what you are doing and you are fine. Let's say you are a fascist, you will be opposed only until you stop being a nazi, no one will fight you if you stop being a nazi. On the other side if you are an enemy of the fascists, there is no compromise, you either fight back or you die. If you are jewish let's say like in the example, no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, you will always be their enemy and when the time comes you will be eleminated.

I think this is also a good example against the etho-state fascists of our time. They are always using arguments like how much they want to have their little tiny ground where only whites are allowed and how much peaceful they would be then. However any group/ideology that will be accumulated through that friend-fiend dichotomy style basis (I mentioned at this Carl Schmitt because he turned this into a political theory) won't stop until it completely devour the *others*."

The camel needs to be at a specific age though, if the camel is too young the hump might not regrow or regrow without the optimal density of fat."
BreadTube,ffzjnct,t1_ffyuk2y,1580382454.0,"Is there a better example to show other than ""stop existing"" or fighting back there is no solution to fascism if you are on the other side of their legitimative ideology of Carl Schmitt's friend and dichotomy."

PokePorn,ffxhywz,t3_evn66b,1580325518.0,I guess I scrolled down way too far this time.
iamverysmart,ffwdilf,t3_ev4r3x,1580296687.0,I would actually respect 3 degrees to a certain degree because it takes some hard work but apperantly that respect can be nullified with one simple tweet.

europe,ffgtyqc,t1_ffeyoe4,1579914996.0,German speaking countries are crazy at that dialect distribution. I somehow think that that has something to do with the mountainous terrain. Maybe traveling between the settlements were really hard through the mountains and also because these are winter countries and therefore settlements mostly stayed isolated and they developed distinct dialects even in relatively small areas?
