Warframe,fem93bu,t1_fem4mwh,1579244291.0,"I added some spacing where I think it would fit without breaking the flow of it all. 

If they left invisibility alone but reworked his other three abilities he'd literally have nothing to lose. Moving to ash a bit his teleport is definitely jarring but it's extremely worth it with his augment giving 200% finisher damage and refunds 50% of the cost on kill it's probably the most overpowered augment since it theoretically is only limited by the melee system which also has no caps to damage, for example my silva and aegis hit for 200 mil the other day because DE forgot it's augment has no cap and it accumulates damage rapidly in high level missions though the two augments don't work together other combos possibly can. 

The bomb idea for Lokis switch teleport sounds cool I doubt the damage would be all that great knowing DE but it gave me a similar idea that can achieve similar results, he drops an arc trap instead stunning the enemy similar to wisps shock mote, for about 7 seconds increasing with duration leaving them open for a finisher.

The merging of invisibility's augment wouldn't be all to bad especially with silence mods be part of weapon exlius category meaning you can swap out a Qol mod of a primary to strengthen your frame making his augment considerably less useful, economically more efficient but not as combat efficient, his current balance is how short his invisibility is, with 306% duration it only lasts 36 seconds meaning you still have to pause between rampages to maintain stealth, ash's is short because it's a get out of jail free card with a touch of shank the warden on the way out.

I get the fear of a warframe rework has, I have my own to with Nyx's inevitable second rework because they fucking broke the frame but if a frame is starting to get left behind so much it falls into niche play it needs to have something done so it can still be relevant, I already spend a lot my free time thinking of ideas of how to fix forgotten weapons and gameplay mechanics and trust me, DE has quite a few things that if they just polish or add to would really breath some new life into old content so the game isn't coasting between expansions, and I don't want to add frames to the mix of content DE neglected, it's easy to rally people to the idea of updating forgotten weapon categories like split weapons, which I've done before recently, didn't get much traction but I just want to get the ball rolling, getting people to rally behind a frame is hard I didn't make the original post for karma because if I did I'd be a fucking idiot, I do it because I believe I feel responsible as a dying breed of warframe veterans to try and help in anyway I can, if I can convince one person that something good can be done to fix this game then I did a good job no matter what anyone else says."
Warframe,fem18qi,t1_felwmjt,1579236480.0,I am trying to find any possibility of the frame being viable so far psychic bolts armor strip and slow is all she's got going for her I've used it against sentients and it kicks ass since it turns them into nothing more than jacked infested but if she was to get a rework I think chaos needs to be tweaked and absorb needs to overhauled or sadly replaced because the endless nerfs and how it absorbing self damage by default is in flux a lot DE clearly don't fully comprehend how far into the shitter the frame is
Warframe,fem0skh,t1_felfff7,1579236087.0,"When I said his invisibility is pathetic i talk about how little it does, with the same 306% duration build ash has 24.47 seconds of invisibility while still stunning nearby enemies, halving ultimate cost and with his augment can give invisibility to all allies, I believe Lokis augment should be merged into his invisibility like it originally was and just given a new simple Augment like kills add another second to invisibility like limbos or harrows augments capping at its max duration I don't know I'm spit balling, but when I say he needs a buff I meant as in quality of life buffs I seemed to have failed to convey that, that's on me.

I do believe he needs a touch up so he's not bound to one ability DE evens says they don't like frames that rely on one ability which is probably why they nerfed his max duration from 60 to 30, if I understand right you build Loki exclusively for his invisibility meaning his other three abilities become situational at best, which is probably the best to describe them, decoy we already agree on, switch teleport seems worse when described by a main because if you haven't had interest in it since LoR that really shows how little use it has had and his augment was released during the time of Loki switch teleporting trolls which is a terrible reason to make an augment, I have never seen anyone ever use it especially when it came out, it to should probably be merged with the ability too with a fixed 6 second duration unaffected by mods which isn't crazy since ash can give himself the same effect by teleporting for free into his ultimate, and I will always stand by radial disarm being a worse chaos even you said why use it when you can just kill them, besides damage frames ultimates are meant to reduce the effort needed to kill radial disarm does not it's even been power crept with baruuk since his disarm is a stack based ability that auto targets enemies, gives damage reduction that can be shared with allies, does more damage, and on top of that combos with his passive all of without having an augment yet.

this will probably be the closest I come to an actual rework but maybe make radial disarm be the augment for switch teleport so when you teleport into a crowd it disarms them albeit with less range and just give him a new ultimate, just spit balling again but I've always imagined every version of Loki as a backstabber in the literal sense give him dual daggers and make his heavy attack do his disarm I believe it would help propel him back into the mets because as I see now Loki is a niche pick especially when invisibility pales in comparison to immortal frames we have now. 

I've followed warframe from the start and have played it for almost as long and I used to main Loki back in the days of derelict defense farm because he used to be a Swiss Army knife of frames but I guess he is immune to power creep since his abilities are only relevant to the meta like vauban used to be. Sorry for the word wall didn't expect it to get so long but I would like to hear your opinion I always mark these as discussions so I can hear people's opinions on more forgotten parks of the game.
