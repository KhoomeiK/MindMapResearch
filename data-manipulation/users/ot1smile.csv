europeanunion,fei1f31,t1_fehz0be,1579128184.0,"I’m bewildered by this. In years of using iPhones and Apple laptops (whose power cables are often similarly criticised) I’ve never had a cable break the way lots of people seem to. My 14 year old has now had a couple of years of hand me down iPhones and in that time has broken 3 cables. You’d assume this is because they were old already but two of those were brand new ones from me or my wife’s upgrades.
I don’t think I take particularly unique care of mine, and I’ve not found myself noticing other people treating their cables in any way that I wouldn’t so I really don’t get why I seem to be so lucky."

TwoXChromosomes,fdmnwhj,t1_fdmacwk,1578557326.0,Yes but it’s not a doctors place to shame someone asking for one while they’re legal. Explaining the risks and ensuring someone is not being flippant about the decision is one thing but snide comments are totally unethical in themselves.
todayilearned,fdliihr,t1_fdlhkb9,1578524765.0,"You referred to people who own their own businesses (and ‘always’) so I figured it applied but I do get your point re the distinction between contractors and a business of her size.
As to her business going under due to her principles; well she’s been doing ok for years, at a time when the local market in her industry is allegedly in decline, and she’s only considered that drastic solution having looked at her turnover and margins and been sure that the business can accommodate it. FWIW she takes home less than many of her staff precisely because she’s acutely aware of the need for long-term security and contingency planning v short term income, preferring to put the profits back into the business rather than into her own pockets and by extension the IR."
TwoXChromosomes,fdleo7i,t1_fdle9jj,1578522404.0,Yeah that was a very glib comment and I appreciate that it’s not what it’s actually about. But the argument that Americans often give as to why they’re against ‘socialised’ healthcare is that there’s no choice and that you have your care dictated to you by the doctor so this kind of story really jars with that.
todayilearned,fdkvr9y,t1_fdkun2o,1578512162.0,Not really unless they were writing for the paper rather than just reading it. Your palette (used figuratively) is your range of skills and techniques. Your palate is your taste in the things you consume.
todayilearned,fdktu8h,t1_fdkrzmy,1578511032.0,Not necessarily. My wife doesn’t make her decisions on those bases and she has a company with a staff of around 40. She’s even prepared to raise her staff’s pay to the level required to make the EU nationals among them eligible to stay in the country if that becomes necessary (which would make them some of the highest paid waiting/kitchen staff in the country afaik).

TwoXChromosomes,fdksmn2,t3_eluwox,1578510309.0,"In the UK the whole point of private healthcare (okay, maybe not quite the whole point) is that you can just ‘buy’ the service you want. Want prescription only painkillers for a minor discomfort? Fine, it’s your money. But even on the NHS we’d be appalled to hear of a doctor behaving like this. My heart goes out to you."
