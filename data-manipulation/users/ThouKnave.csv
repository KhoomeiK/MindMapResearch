Booma-pets are kept in small pastures isolated by stone walls.  Or sent 1 by 1 to visit angry mechanoids guarding that poison ship.

Default meal plans will let pawns eat the raw material you plan to cook with, before you can cook it.

No plants in your map? You can take simple meals off the menu, then make them exclusively from human flesh (raider) and put them on a shelf in you pet zone.

Area management is your ally.  Learn and love it.

legaladvice,fbgwkny,t3_ed9jhq,1576860234.0,"Not legal advice, do check with a doctor.  Most things were mentioned above except: there are nerves that are rather exposed at the elbows.  If they are damaged everything below that point can lose feeling.  Resting elbows on the desk wrong, too much pressure, too hard of a surface or bumping it just right can all do that.

Also petit builds have less padding to protect there if that applies. (Have a family member that has to be careful with their elbows for the above reasons)

Hope that helps some, but always check with a professional.  Good luck."
