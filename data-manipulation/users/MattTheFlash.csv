Basically Joel Schumacer departed from Tim Burton's original 1989 image for Batman: dark, scary, serious and instead decided he would instead make a the Superfriends cartoon / 1967 Batman come to life version while continuing the same continuity (Alfred the Butler is the same actor). Joel is a flamboyant person and made Batman equally flamboyant: he put nipples on the Batsuit and big codpieces on the groins, and all the sets looked like a discoteque from 1986. The acting was as wooden and stupid as imaginable, the props stupid and even comical, and nothing made any sense. The Clooney one was decidedly worse, but that's really just comparing two piles of shit.
