writing,fedfr82,t3_eoi3in,1579010313.0,"As long as you don't have a deadline, I say write whatever inspires you at the moment. That's the beauty of editing: nothing ever has to be good until it's done. If you write something you don't like, later, just cut it. There is never a reason to not write, and I find, at least that the more inspired you are to write something, the more of it is kept in the final draft. 

As long as you have time to jump back and forth, this can be helpful in not burning yourself out on one thing or another."
writing,fedeq4c,t3_eod9y3,1579009482.0,"Try not to think of it as though you're asking arbitrary questions and expecting them to answer. You come up with questions that have to do with what you already have about them, and answer them in a way that they would answer.

For example, if you have a thief, you can ask what their favourite thing is to steal. Then, build an answer around the question in a way their character would answer. 

A few examples of answers:

- ""shiiiiineeeeey""
- ""who the fuck are you? Why would I answer that?""
- ""...""
- ""I don't have the faintest idea what you are talking about. I've never stolen a thing in my life.""
- the character simply kills you on the spot.

See, each of these answers gives very different feelings, helping to flesh the character out more, but in a way that may or may not necessarily make it into the story itself. Then, when you're further along, you can have them do something very much in line with their character, for example, if they answered the first suggestion above, you can have them steal something shiney, and have them react in a humourous way, where they're super excited and entranced by the brilliance of the thing.


See it's all just to help understand and flesh out what your characters would do in situations that don't necessarily make it into the story."
funny,fdv2quq,t1_fdrtlfy,1578742494.0,"Basically saying that people who don't close the lid,literally end up eating shit, and finishing it off with ""food for thought"" got a nearly visceral reaction from me, so uh, thanks for that..."
delusionalartists,fdj6sqk,t1_fdhknfk,1578460056.0,"You are so sweet and helpful. Thank you so much! I will keep all of this in mind. I'm also an author, although due to disability, I haven't been able to write much over the last 7 or so years. When I had a lot of works for sale, I went in to a local, high end coffee shop and asked if they would be okay with me doing readings from some of the anthologies I am/was published in. They were extremely interested, and very excited about the prospect. I entirely forgot before reading your comment just now. So I may do the same, but for my art, and see how it goes. Thank you again!"
ballpython,fdj50tm,t1_fdhtg9q,1578458624.0,I think that's the best wish one can possibly give. I can tell you're a very kind person from what you've said. Thank you for your returned support and I hope you have a wonderful year.

AskReddit,fdhip8l,t1_fdhhgvv,1578423479.0,Thanks for responding! This kind of stuff really interests me. I've only ever seen it from the employee side.

ballpython,fdhg0me,t3_el8by0,1578421858.0,I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my first BP to my ex in a breakup. He told me a few years later that Kira (its name) passed away awhile beforehand.

delusionalartists,fdhapzq,t3_el4k99,1578418998.0,"It's actually one of my dreams to have a piece of mine in a coffee shop, for sale. I just end up gifting my art to friends, and never seem to have any to offer. 

That has changed over the past few years, but being in a wheelchair means I don't get out much for stuff like that. I'm also hoping I have a webpage by then. I feel like there's no point putting my art out there for people to buy, if they can't have a landing spot (other than my instagram) to see other stuff. I'm also scared no one will be interested. I have sold art in the past, but it was all commissions/for charity. Not that I'm complaining, I just worry the stuff I want to paint won't be sought after. #justartistparanoia lol"
