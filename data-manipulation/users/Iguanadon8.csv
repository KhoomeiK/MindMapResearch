languagelearning,fdii4yr,t3_elfzhc,1578443439.0,"Hiya,if you learn Norwegian you will be able to learn one of the others sooner than if you start with one of them because Norwegian grammar is quite similar to English grammar from what I’ve seen,there aren’t any really fancy word endings that change based on the person you’re talking about or really fancy word endings based on tenses,because I tried it a few years ago but I’m not a very easily motivated person so I left it but I’m trying to find free language resources to pick it back up with.Also there are many words that sound really similar to English words or sound very nearly the same but are spelt differently,so some sentences sound like they’re in a really weird dialect of English,I think it’s the easiest language for English speaking people to learn,and I found a list of languages that are easy to learn if you speak English and the author agreed,it was first.Another thing is,is that the words aren’t fancy sounding so it’s a practical sounding language,good for the purpose of communicating rather than the purpose of sounding fancy like Italian;I think the words being so fancy makes Romance languages annoying to learn because it makes them harder to remember but I don’t know what the language group of your first language is so they could be easy for you,but I do think that Norwegian words are easy to remember,so definitely go for Norwegian,you’ll be able to speak another language in a short time compared to most other languages and it’s fun to speak because of how similar some of it sounds to English."
Subliminal,fdcw3ox,t3_ekiz5f,1578286007.0,"They probably won’t work because your mind will get confused but I don’t see how a subliminal for straightening teeth could work unless the person who made it knows how teeth are straightened naturally,for teeth to straighten naturally you either have to chew hard foods at a young age when your bones are really malleable so that the facial bones will compress through exercise therefore widening the jaws or you must practice correct oral posture which it sounds like you haven’t come across,if you want proper beauty then tongue posture is a must,commonly called mewing.For teeth to be naturally straight you need to have a jaw that’s either wide or long enough to fit all of your teeth in without cramming.What people view as model jawlines are long jaws,they’re long in the sense that the jaws are forward,rather than having a side profile where their faces morph into their necks,but the face isn’t long,mewing makes the face shorter because it compresses your facial bones like chewing from a young age would but it brings your jaws forward more than it widens your face like chewing does,I’ll leave the differences between these two things out but tongue posture gives you compact facial features,it makes your nose shorter and makes the distance between your nose and mouth shorter,and it does widen the face but a wide face from bone structure is almost always attractive because I know loads of people want slimmer faces.Also people with really forward jaws have faces that don’t droop when they get older because their tongues are fighting gravity holding their faces up.Another reason why I recommend this is for health reasons,jaws that are pretty far back in your face,called recessed jaws compress the airways which is not good,forward jaws open them because they’re not directly above them,and recessed jaws also give you poor posture because the weight of them hovering above your spine causes your neck to push forward to save your back from the weight,giving you a natural gamer neck,and to have a straight upright back where you pull your shoulders back giving your chest a lift which makes your waist smaller,you’d need your neck to be upright too so that you wouldn’t look weird but that would be putting all the weight of your jaws onto your spine,and other than really aching after a while it weakens your spine with all the stress it puts on it.So,DEFINITELY check mewing out,all it is is training your tongue to lie on the roof and assert force whenever your mouth is shut.It will give you good bone structure,sometimes it can push the cheekbones out depending how much force you apply with your tongue,as well as a shorter nose,shorter philtrum (distance between nose and mouth),and a more symmetrical face as it will actually sort out the symmetry of your bones because it’s literally pushing your bones up,so if you’ve got a dropping lip,eye or one side of your nose then apply pressure to the roof of your mouth with your tongue and it will lift it;You’ll also get a model jawline which unless the subliminal is telling you to push your tongue up,you won’t get because you need force to fight gravity with to move your jaws forward,and along with all of these wonders you’ll get straight teeth and a wider smile,(it’s hard to explain how that happens but it does),so you’d be mad not to try mewing,it does work,there’s a subreddit for it if you want to have a look at other people’s progress and advice but it does take a long time to make the massive difference that I’ve been explaining,good luck."
Subliminal,fdcrcvk,t3_ekj71g,1578282149.0,"Hi I’ve been meaning to get subliminal messages into my subconscious for ages but haven’t been bothered to yet,but,I have researched the whole effects of subliminal messages on physical appearance and have quite a bit to share with you.Your brain goes into different levels of consciousness at different times of day,and the trance-like state that you’re in when you’re not asleep but barely awake is the time where your subconscious mind is open to anything you tell it,it will apparently believe anything it is told,this is how hypnotism works.When you’re awake it’s much harder for things to go into your subconscious so I suggest that you either listen to subliminals when you go to bed,or,you try this which is recommended a lot:When you go to bed,chant over and over again the same statement that you look a certain way,apparently saying ‘I want to have’ doesn’t work as it puts more wanting into your subconscious ,but ‘I have’ does work as it works the same as the placebo effect,if you don’t know what that is because I don’t know how old you are,it is your body doing what you believe it will,so doctors give patients pills made of sugar which they tell the patients will heal ailments and the ailments heal when the pills are taken because the person believes that the pills will work,so this is how subliminal messages for appearance work,you believe anything you’re told in that trance-like state so your brain then tells your body to do as you expect it to.It’s also advised on many sites that you visualise the features you want whilst you’re repeating your statement,probably because unlike pills healing things,a particular look is more specific than just wanting a healed-look,so you have to point your mind in the direction you want it to go.Another thing you can do is choose a certain food item,and use it as a placebo because it’s been proven that placebos can work even when you know they’re placebos,so choose a food item and imagine that it’s a pill for what you want to look like,you can have different foods for different features and again imagine the features whilst you’re taking your ‘pills’Also,apparently drawing puts your brain in a state that makes your subconscious brain more accessible,which is easy to imagine because most people feel dreamy when drawing,because they’re in a less conscious state of mind,so if you listen to subliminals whilst drawing they should be more effective."
