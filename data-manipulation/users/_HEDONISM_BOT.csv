I’m never ever EVER going to settle or entertain these men ever without a ring and a profitable divorce prospect.


Fuck that life and fuck them for their shitty entitled arrogance"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fgkw34k,t1_fgk8qkd,1580874965.0,I bet you he started cheating as soon as the court proceedings began. I get the feeling that he didn't even wait for the settlement to be issued. Like he began looking for upgrades as soon as he sniffed the possibility of money coming into his life.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fgkvz9y,t1_fgkdrcb,1580874890.0,"One of the mods here with the ""ruthless strategist"" flair straight up told me that she will ONLY marry a man if she stands to profit legally off of the divorce and I still haven't forgotten those words.

They actually shaped how I date. I ONLY date top tier earners and ONLY date them if they're wining and dining me on their penny. I'm also never marrying unless I stand to profit from the divorce."

I hope he gets gutted in court. What a shitty mindset for him to have towards the hand that feeds him, cares for him, AND subsidizes his very expensive healthcare."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fgkvfqg,t1_fgkffo1,1580874515.0,">Uses her for insurance, cheats, and wants to run with the $.

This is a recurring theme that I see over and over and over again all over the dating, relationship, love, marriage, ex, and breakup/heartbreak subs.

Men leaving women as SOON as their life situation improves. I see men upgrading their wife as soon as they get a massive bonus at work, a pay raise, a new job at a new office with new female coworkers, an inheritance, a lucky lottery ticket and/or life-insurance payout from a distant relative. Sometimes they graduate college and find their first job. Suddenly their high school sweetheart that they've dated/strung along for 8+ years is not good enough and ""they're unhappy"". It never ever fails. Their life situation improves; then they upgrade the wife.

&#x200B;

Idk why they're like this, they just are. It's one of the very few things that I'm now convinced is universal among men. The only other universal truth about them is how they ALL unanimously react in similar ways to being told their partner's sexual past."

and he's already looking to upgrade the wife. How much do you wanna bet that he's going to need a new car to go along with the new babes he's going to import into his life with his $1.4 M / $40M attitude ?"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fgkv025,t1_fgkphnq,1580874220.0,Part of me hopes that the settlement money is considered marital income and she gets to keep some of it in the divorce.

FemaleDatingStrategy,fgjpc8y,t1_fgjnwmv,1580848736.0,">After he had asked for an open relationship and I went along with it and wanted it too. Then he slept with his best friend the night before our wedding, struggled to get dates and then got really upset when I fell in love with the other person I was dating. He eventually demanded I choose between my bf and my husband, while still having a gf. And my bf wasn’t punching walls. So I left. Goodbye entitled couch creature. That very mediocre man who had no ambition made me feel like I was not good enough for him for years, like he needed to sleep with other ppl. As a single woman, it turns out I’m a fucking prize and I have men left and right dying to lock me down in a relationship.

Good riddance. Funny how ""open"" only seemed to apply to him in his mind. He could dish it but couldn't take it. Fucking hypocrite."

That divorce sub, along with heartbreak, ex-no-contact, and the various other breakup / dating subs seriously make me appreciate, to the fullest extent, the fact that I'm single, and I control EXACTLY how much space in my life certain men are allowed to occupy.
