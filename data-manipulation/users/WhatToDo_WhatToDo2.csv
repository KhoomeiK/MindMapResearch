This is about hygiene and you want the best for her b/c it’s a lifelong ritual. If she’s not ok now then she definitely won’t be ok as she gets older and whatever is going on will get worse. It might be a good idea to encourage regular visits with a gynecologist just for overall health.

AskReddit,fg8e7x1,t3_exbcj3,1580616898.0,"Oh my goodness, where to even start. There are a lot of great responses already so I apologize if I list some things already mentioned. I wish  people in general understood what the “[spectrum](https://theaspergian.com/2019/05/04/its-a-spectrum-doesnt-mean-what-you-think/)” actually means. That more and more adults are now discovering they’re autistic after a lifetime of knowing they’re different but having no understanding of what it was. That it is a neurological and developmental difference, not a disease to be cured or a set of symptoms to train into compliance. I was diagnosed later in life. One of the first notions I encountered from those closest to me was this idea that I was taking a “label” and confusing it with identity. I can’t stress enough that I’ve lived my entire life feeling like an imposter and wondering what it must be like to be you. Now, I finally know who I am and with that comes the understanding that there’s no magic line between “the label” and me. You can’t remove one from the other, they are same-same. That is why many of us prefer to use and feel strongly about identity first language (autistic) instead of person first (with autism). *Note, it’s up to the individual in how they want to identify and whatever that choice is should be respected. Period. 
I think it’s great that conversations like this are becoming more prominent because the truth is, whether you knew it or not, you’ve probably met and/or worked alongside an autistic."

If you don’t think you’re connecting with them it’s ok to say that and try someone else. Don’t let online negativity take up so much of your process.
