Well, I guess if you have heard before and you disagree,  hearing it again would be annoying, agree. Before Christianity became good news to me, also find it repetitive and annoying. I mentioned in another comment, I would hate it if their intentions were corporate, like just to spread religion. But if they come across as genuine people, then it's their way of doing good though you don't find it beneficial to you 

I guess you can tell them you heard before and that they met you before? They probably can't remember you if they spoke to more ppl"
singapore,fe8rk6f,t1_fe829gh,1578929762.0,"I think that is what will define whether it's good or bad - the intention. If you are sharing about God as a salesman with some KPI (a mere activity or ritual), then I question their practices. However, if they are sharing out of pure sincerity and concern, then I have nothing against them. Can you fault someone who is trying to do you good (although based on their personal beliefs)? Granted, you may not agree, but they don't mean any harm. 

Singapore has religious freedom anyway, so any religion can go ahead and share. those that are genuine , I have nothing against them. But the ones that just want to add to their numbers I hate too"
