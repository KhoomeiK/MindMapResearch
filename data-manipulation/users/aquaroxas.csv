I just really like the concept of it, and the fact that it takes place in Texas (although not my particular neck of the woods but close enough.) Some people thought I was my last name... I was like really y’all?"

Buuuut you may wanna ask if you can record their lecture so you can go back and listen for anything you missed. Don’t use this as an excuse to pass out in class though. 

Hope this helps!"
TalesFromTheTheatre,fenmakc,t3_eq3yxy,1579287729.0,"Soooo I'm a sup (TLD) and I'm in a similar boat. No SO or family of my own but throw in going to school full time (12-16 hours) and getting up at 6:30am every weekday to make it to class. If I close I usually end up getting home sometime around 1am and sometimes when I open I have to be there at 7:30 in the morning.

Honestly, it's just become my way of life. I've been doing this for 2 years as a sup and even as crew before that bc I stayed LATE to clean concessions. The only reason I've stayed is because it's a stable job to keep while in college and it helps me pay for tuition. It's not the most glamorous job and you're not alone in it being miserable at all, but to be fair, it should've been known that as a manager you're gonna have to stay late and not have the greatest of shifts. Not trying to be a jerk but that part is sort of a given.

Anyway, when I have a family event that I have to go to, I usually make arrangements with my GM in advance to let them know that I'd prefer the day off. We have another sup so my GM tries to be fair with our off schedule and rotates us between opening and closing shifts. I'd hope that you have another couple managers that you can mix your shifts up with.

Yes, I know it sucks so if you really don't like the hours, definitely start looking somewhere else. It's not gonna get any different, especially during peak business times like spring break and the summer. Better to let your GM know that this isn't gonna work out for you rather than fall into a miserable state going to work every day.

Sorry my post is a little long but I hope everything works out for you"
