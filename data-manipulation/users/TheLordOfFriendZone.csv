I use this ability to get what I want from people, but being an introvert, it's something I really hate doing. Too much energy required."

AskReddit,fev91ph,t3_eqies2,1579394560.0,"Its been 6 years. It was raining that night. No lightning or thunder; just a mellow rain. For some reason, I went out on the front porch. In the sky, I saw 4 bright ball-like shapes of light that seemed to be playing around with each other. They weren't too far, just seemed to be on the top of the house in front of ours. I thought I was seeing things. I looked away, looked back, closed my eyes thinking it'll vanish. They were still there. I found myself enchanted by them and continued watching them for the next 5 minutes or so. I thought I'd call my roommate and show him too. Went inside to get him and when we came back, there was nothing. I still don't know what that thing was but I wish to see it again someday."

Every passing day, I'm looking at myself and my life as an outsider and nothing seems to make sense. More often than not, the existential crisis creeps in. I snap back, look around and feel how beautiful everything is, and how I can savor the sweet elixir of life. The cycle repeats. Endlessly."
