Gullible is whoever thinks men aren’t capable of such silliness.

It is just incredibly stupid however one thinks of it and would have been so even back then, or did they have experience of random organs exploding? Like... wtf!"

TooAfraidToAsk,ff76ssp,t1_ff5v7oo,1579642249.0,"it is not different is it? It is shallow. Dont get me wrong. I am not saying I dont share it too, but I just think we can say we have a little prejudice about red hair and skinny men. Like, do you think no skinny men in the history of skinny men in all mankind would ever be someone you got to know and became attracted to? Do you see how this idea is crazy and a bit shallow? Like people are more than skinny legs and I know that there is no hate in this but one of them could be an incredibly amazing person that would make you absolutely happy but it may not ever happen because you didn't give him a second look just because he had sticky legs and no butt. 
Everybody does it tough, we all have preferences and that is alright, but so is calling it by what it is. 
Luckily to every other type that you like there is also the possibility that you will find someone to make you happy. And so it goes for everyone else. It is fine. I am just pointing it out as a definition - word not as a stigma."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff763nx,t1_ff69meq,1579641860.0,"It wasnt unrelated. You tried to say that everyone does things the same way as americans, that physical attraction is what makes people start dating. I told you about two situations I went through in the US where people thought it was acceptable to behave as creeps because they found me attractive and for them that was enough to ask me out. If this is how you thing normal dating is, it was used to point out that no, most people do not start dating like that."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff75sxs,t1_ff6acyc,1579641695.0,"You are the one who feels threatened by the word. I don't. I have my preferences too, and I admit that they are not very open or broad. I am fine with that, they are my choices and they don't have to be broad. Pathetic is being so scared of a word that you cannot look at your own behavior and admit to yourself that it fits to your behavior then going around being mad at people on the internet for pointing it out. 
And you see, it is not hypocritical; I admit to it on my side. Not exactly based on skin colors but other factors. Hypocritical would be if I did do that but pretended I didn't to point it out on others, but that isn’t what i am doing."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff7556a,t1_ff6e3wb,1579641322.0,"Relationships aren't about looks! They simply are not. Many may start because of them but they do not last because of them. And to say that most people are in relationships because of looks? What world are you living in? I pity you. 
Hahaha say that most people are in relationships because of looks is what is gatekeeping. There is nothing wrong or shameful in wanting to be with someone you personally find attractive. Instead saying everyone from one skin colour or another cannot be attractive because they have that skin color is what is not right. Can you say that you are not attracted to anyone of one skin color or another until you have seen them all? It is shallow and it is racism."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff74ik8,t1_ff6eeri,1579640962.0,"Oh mate, the same dictionary entry also says: ""the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races."" 
Let's see, not possessing attractive characteristics, abilities or qualities and there are unattractive or less attractive (or inferior in the attractive scale). 
Pretty silly to pick and choose which part of the description you want to use. But you forgot I also have google and know how to use a dictionary.

TooAfraidToAsk,ff672yp,t1_ff63612,1579620686.0,"Where you live it may be this way. Where I am it is not. I remember when I went to the US and some random yelled at me from across the street then crossed the street to ask me on a date. Like wtf! Another time this weirdo followed me with his car, while I was rollerblading. I thought he wanted to kidnap me or something. No. He wanted to ask for my phone number! 
That shit aint normal in many parts of the world. You date people you know you have common interests, who you are attracted to as a person and you want to get to know them better."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff66ht6,t1_ff5vhap,1579620302.0,"I am not saying people are owed anything. I am saying judging an entire group based on skin color is discrimination. Not involving penis or vaginas but solely skin color, like the person on the comment I replied to. 

Being at first glance attracted to someone is usually due to physical attributes. Falling in love isn’t. I pray that people who just want to be with me for looks stay far away. 
I am not talking about gender.  You may call it bullshit because you don’t want to admit to being described by a word with negative connotations. 
Nobody owns anyone (and the one is important) a relationship or sex. I can say I am not attracted to you because you are white-black-asian. But saying at once that all people who share your skin color are unattractive because of the skin color is pretty stupid and it is discriminatory. People downvoting need to get to grips with what you believe and face it however it is."

TooAfraidToAsk,ff5uj1i,t1_ff5qx2l,1579610723.0,Well. I am replying to a comment about skin color not genitalia. I think it is very different. And I agree with you about this point. I am also only attracted to one type of genitalia and for me there is no way around it.
TooAfraidToAsk,ff5u966,t1_ff5tj4n,1579610447.0,"I love this “woke bullshit”. Then again I am happy to fit in that. Attraction beyond looks is about personality and about who that person is and how they treat you. 
Nobody is saying you are not allowed to have preferences, what I am saying is that if you think every person in any race or group cannot have a personality that you would love or characteristics that make you love them and that they are not able to treat you better than anyone and thus love them... you see the point? Love and relationships are not about looks. It is a deeper and more meaningful connection. And denying everyone in a certain race a chance - you don’t own anyone a relationship, because of their race is discriminatory (as it is happening solely because of that race). You see? 
However it doesn’t necessarily comes from a place of hate. It relates to OP’s question too. It comes from a shallow judgement but not from hate. Does it make it bad? It is just a word and a name in the end. If you discriminate against skin color than you do. That is your thing. It doesn’t mean you hate them, wish them harm or anything bad. So that’s that. You are not forced to be different and you should do what you feel, and if you dont want to change that about you, don’t. Live your life. But calling it what it is based on its definition shouldn’t offend you."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff5nsx3,t1_ff4mi98,1579602251.0,"I guess the idea is to go beyond color and be attracted to the person. If you just eliminate entire groups out of your dating pool because of their skin color you are saying that none of them can be/have the qualities you would love in someone. It is shallow and yes, racist too.
Finding someone attractive for their looks is one thing, dating someone for who they are is another. But not giving someone a chance past their looks is very problematic."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff5nip9,t1_ff4t8u1,1579601818.0,The thing is they are preaching that they are not gay by choice. That they cannot help the way they feel about the same gender. Yet they want to force others to feel something that isn’t there? Wow! A+ for logic.
TooAfraidToAsk,ff5ne2s,t3_erl3o2,1579601626.0,"
Taking away the power of the word from them is the way to go. As long as you are afraid of being called transphobic they hold power over you. Stop being afraid of someone labelling you something negative. You don’t need to change your behaviour in this instance."
