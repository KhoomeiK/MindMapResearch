AskReddit,ffeelx4,t3_et5oij,1579845116.0,Man it’s hard to pick one single guitarist when there are so many insanely good ones and people who have had such a major influence on guitar and music in general. Classics like Hendrix and Clapton vai and satch or Stevie ray vaughn. Old school shredders like Paul Gilbert yngwie malmsteen and Jason Becker then you got the new breed with tosin abasi Jason Richardson and so many others or even off the wall people like josh Martin from little tybee. God you can’t forget John petrucci. And just gnarly riffing you got people like Wes hauch and Keith Merrow. There’s so many to choose from how can you pick just one?
