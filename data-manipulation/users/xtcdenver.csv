When you're fasting, your kidneys are still filtering, and you're still drinking water (and tea and coffee). This makes the sodium, potassium, magnesium, etc. levels in your body more dilute. People sometimes say they get cramps or headaches, but in my experience it just results in being ridiculously hungry. Maybe try a little salt when you're obsessing about food.

I would even drench it in carpet cleaner before turning the water on it. Make sure it's on top of something though, because it will be too heavy to lift after it's full of water.

My husband used to smoke in his truck. I can't believe this worked, but he would hose out the carpet (yes, like inside the car). I figured it was a 1998 Dodge Ram, it was supposed to be abused. But man, hosing it out got rid of all the smell.

climateskeptics,fe5inxy,t1_fe5d69i,1578869939.0,"Okay agreed... so you're saying we can't use our personal observations on weather to determine climate, because weather is not climate as it can shift wildly. 

I would argue (again, just for discussion's sake) then, that your observation of some days this winter being 20 degrees higher also cannot be used as proof.  It doesn't fit the climate change predictions, anyway. 20 degrees increase is not a global warming prediction. Neither is ten degrees. Neither is five. One degree, completely imperceptible by a human, is the consensus. So the weather you feel today cannot be used to support the climate change hypothesis, because the prediction made by science is imperceivable to us.

BTW- not saying it's wrong per say, only saying this evidence does not support what the prediction is."
climateskeptics,fe5bvjx,t1_fe598gs,1578867440.0,"I'm using Fahrenheit, too. It's supposed to be a degree Fahrenheit increase over our lifetime (about 2 degrees in the century, Fahrenheit).

Twenty degrees doesn't fit the scientific predictions, but you're using it as the evidence to support it."
climateskeptics,fe57yxu,t3_ensmvx,1578866415.0,"Just to be clear, the scientists say there has been one degree of warming in my (and your, I assume) lifetime. You're saying you're seeing twenty degrees of warming. 

So, just from a purely scientific discourse, let's say the one degree is 100% climate change. How would you explain the other nineteen degrees of increase?  I'm really looking for an honest discussion, not being argumentative. Not this year here in Colorado, but last year I experienced weather that was like you say, on average 20 degrees warmer for the whole winter. So one degree is climate change - what's the rest?

We need to really examine this question- all global warming proponents say they are seeing much, much higher temps than when they were kids - but the global warming scientists say it's only 1 degree (almost imperceptible by a human). How is this possible?"

I'm copying and pasting from their own junk data so nobody else has to wade through trying to figure out how they came up with a ridiculous number like that. It's mostly estimates on population reduction due to deforestation and climate changes not actual bird deaths, such is the case with wind power. Oh, except the birds electrocuted on power lines....which still exist with wind power.

""Coal-, oil-, and natural gas-fired power plants induce avian deaths at various points throughout their fuel cycle: upstream during coal mining, collision and electrocution with operating plant equipment, and poisoning and death caused by acid rain, mercury pollution, and climate change.""

191,722 estimated avian deaths from deforestation (they don't tally deaths from scraping the landscape for wind fields)

467 from colliding with power lines

2-5% of wood thrush population (not died, just adjusting for habitat alteration

3-50% reductions in annual colony size to possible mercury poisoning

While efforts at quantification are highly uncertain, they extrapolated their results to posit that mercury poisoning and contamination were responsible for population declines ranging from 1 to 11% across 14 species of penguins, albatross, ducks, eagles, hawks, terns, gulls, and other birds.

Finally, while perhaps the most difficult to quantify, climate change is already threatening the survival of millions of birds around the world. About 80% of the North American duck population...

So there you have it, folks. That's the source of the 7.9 million bird deaths from coal. They have literally taken percentages of bird populations and estimated the number reduced by climate change and acid rain and claimed them to be 7.9 million bird deaths due to coal, and attributed exactly 467 deaths to electrical wires (which are necessary with wind power, also). So that's.....zero actual avian deaths from coal, friends."
