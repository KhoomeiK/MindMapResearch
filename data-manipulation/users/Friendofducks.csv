pics,fgkz29k,t3_eyzpvj,1580877168.0,"I love this photo. So much going on, yet feels completely at ease. You really captured the moment, perhaps even just by chance."
UrbanHell,fgkx8eh,t1_fgku4kb,1580875783.0,"Santa Rosa lost 5000 houses and many more thousand outbuildings due to the Tubbs fire. As in, they burnt down to ashes and all the infrastructure (water; gas, sewage) was also lost. They are still in a housing crisis. In 2017 it was the most destructive fire in CA history. However; that record was beat a year later by the Camp fire."
UrbanHell,fgkwwqx,t1_fgkvczz,1580875550.0,Although it has its problems the thought of Sonoma county as Urbanhell is quite absurd. That being said homelessness if out of control everywhere in CA with no solution in sight.

politics,ffz2sbe,t3_evxeyy,1580362093.0,Very succinct and efficient description of the wretchedness of the Republican Party.
politics,ffu9nmu,t3_ev554q,1580237398.0,"Good lord. What in the fuck is going to take for the Republican Party to wake up? Trump to invade Mexico? Launching a nuclear strike on Panama?

Bolton could not be more of a right wing republican was hawk all the way to his cellular level. I was terrified when he was appointed. Now I'm cheering for this war monger to bring safety and security to the planet.

Trump needs to go. The Republican Party sit by and watch the place burn."
todayilearned,ffspqm2,t1_ffs2vtt,1580188215.0,"I'm not so sure. I know plenty of people/friends in Wisconsin that seem to consider it some kind of badge of honor or achievement. I'm assuming it's a lot of defensive mechanisms but I recall a lot of ""oooohh boy I sure am getting fat!""  While embracing an unhealthy lifestyle, pounding booze etc."
politics,ffdh0ee,t3_eswsmo,1579820677.0,"Beautifully stated in this article. The right has been playing this end game for years and now have the cover of a lunatic unhinged disgusting animal of a president to hide behind  to peruse their racist goals. They are beyond redemption and so are their willingly ignorant followers who support them. 

Kick them all out. Rise up and fight these  monsters with your vote."

AdviceAnimals,ff8hu1a,t1_ff8b4pg,1579679147.0,I must add. Even if you have insurance and go to an er sure as the day is long they will try and fuck you. They can call it a non Emergancy visit. So I have learned to make sure you say you have chest or heart pain as that it will always be covered.  Otherwise if you go in for abdominal issue you are rolling the dice. Fucking BS.
oilpainting,ff43208,t3_erfibq,1579554461.0,Very cool! Has a computer graphic or comic feel. Really like it.
news,ff3zyxv,t1_ff3yl9o,1579552544.0,Why? They use extreme sports there like bungee jumping to slaughter animals?
politics,ff3zk01,t3_erhcrr,1579552289.0,Racist president. Constant spin to cover up for this piece of shit. He is a horrible human and anyone who supports him better look deep in the mirror and and reflect when they drive into their church parking lot on Sunday morning. The hypocrisy is horrific.
news,ff3x81b,t3_erbkj8,1579550831.0,So disgusting. Beyond words.
politics,ff3wmxo,t3_erdlu8,1579550458.0,Then fucking run against one of them. He had a chance to be a leader and he walked.
aww,ff0w51x,t3_eqvyyb,1579472815.0,Elkhound?
AskSF,feo2otn,t3_eq55jd,1579294274.0,Who is your agent by chance? I had this exact same thing happen to me and I fought it very hard. While State Farm certainly increases their fees - At the end of the day this is the individual agents decision to raise rates.  This is assuming you did not have an accident or anything that would justify a raise.
NorwegianElkhound,feiuwut,t3_ep2gk4,1579147875.0,Sweet hound
TrailGuides,fe57vq3,t3_entbtr,1578866385.0,"This is really great stuff. I have never even heard of the GHT. I have fond memories of trekking the Annapurna circuit in 1999- despite the fact I had pretty significant food borne pathogens coursing through my intestines for 10 days I would love to go back. I follow Nepalize politics so I wonder how it has changed. 
Thanks for sharing this information and best of luck on your adventures!"
politics,fe42mql,t1_fe3i9ey,1578855152.0,"This. It's so sad and so true.

Let's not forget.

*while deomocets are usually pulling the country out of a republican caused recession - see point above- soon begins a cycle of extreme republican anger swelling and somehow democrats lose momentum and get beat in the midterm polls. Even though EVERY SINGLE Fucking statistic is in Democrat's favor to hold the power and presidency for the next 100 years. In spite of all the stupid illegitimate and disgusting republican vote suppression techniques they can not stop the demographic change or the views or #s  of voters of the Gen z generation.

I don't get it."
medizzy,fdu3sci,t3_emyopo,1578727031.0,How the fuck do I turn this Shit off my feed? Why did this show up? Absolutely terrible.

AdviceAnimals,fdsxmeq,t3_emteaj,1578709272.0,Brilliant.
