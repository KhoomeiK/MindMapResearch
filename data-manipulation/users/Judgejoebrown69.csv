Look at Europe and how many white dudes can play in the NBA. Is it because Europe has better facilities? Is it because Europe has better athletes? Hell no, it’s because white people love the sport and grow up thinking they can play it in their league. 

How many super athletic white dudes do you think had the choice between a basketball and a football scholarship and picked football because it was a better shot at the pros. Or how many kids do you think chose football over basketball because their parents were more comfortable with a white coach or white players instead of a team full of black kids with a black coach? It’s the same reason we don’t see a lot of black swimmers or hockey players. It’s not that they can’t, it’s just hard to get into when you don’t have the base of people.

Your argument is it’s entirely due to trump, if not entirely, then largely due to him. The source you linked said that as well. Thats also the general gist of what you’ve been saying the past 2 comments. 

My argument is that Trump has done a good job continuing the economic growth we saw in the later half of Obama’s presidency. I don’t think the president has as much pull to stimulate economic growth in the first month of his tenure and its most likely due to the economic shifts we were already experiencing. Hence why I don’t think it’s entirely trumps policies that led to the median income growth.

Regarding the stock market under trump; if you truly believe all of the stock market and median income gains are DUE to Trump entirely you’re an very stupid. Even the hardest pro-trump person has to acknowledge the president isn’t an all powerful entity. The economy isn’t dependent entirely on economic policies or tax cuts. There’s so many factors to attribute it entirely to him is absolutely idiotic. 

Trump hasn’t increased manufacturing jobs. It says so in a link of your own source. https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/manufacturing-construction-signals-flash-red. In fact under him, according to the data it’s lower than ever. Kind of a bad look to link something that completely disregards your argument about manufacturing health. 

About the actual median income changes. It seems to me that if Trumps median income growth increased his first month before he did anything, it seems like maybe it’s due to other factors than him (maybe compliment Obama’s presidency). I’m on mobile and super busy so I can’t look up the actual numbers but it’s good he’s managed to continue the economic gain. I don’t think it’s entirely due to any of his policies personally, but it might be. As I’ve said when I get home I might take a look, but tbh I’m pretty neutral about his presidency, I just hate when people act like he’s either satan or Jesus."

There will usually be an increase in price because quite frankly, a massive tax increase is pretty good reason to increase prices. 

Also the main goal of the tax is to increase the quality of government programs, so it’s kind of a borrow from Peter to pay Paul situation. But in this case Peter “should” be something you didn’t need, whereas Paul should be something needed for their goal. 

It’s not as simple as having the mindset of “taxing is bad because prices increase.” It should be “are the programs were receiving worth the increase in price.” For example I would gladly pay an extra 50 cents for slim Jim’s (there’s a factory near my town) if it meant slim Jim’s would pay for all of my towns pot holes to be fixed.

Also Man U fucks up every young player they have on my saves."

Not excusing this behavior but there’s a difference. I would also add I don’t even think that’s what she’s doing. He could’ve very well said “oh I’m hungry too, we should split something.” Like a normal human being instead of jumping to being a victim."
todayilearned,fcs2d4j,t1_fcry75e,1577910411.0,"Cmon dude it’s a redditor saying it. This isn’t a political statement, it’s someone who went out of their way to randomly add the fact that a Japanese official is ignoring a part of their history. On a post that’s a feel good story about the Japanese. 

Obviously if you look at my statement without any context is seems naive. I’d assume anyone who’s willing to just mention it at any opportunity is a very self-righteous person, which if we’re looking at the context of this post, seems evident."
todayilearned,fcrt527,t1_fcrqqwe,1577906267.0,AFAIK it’s not canon so you can ignore it.
politics,fcrsxli,t1_fcrqw24,1577906191.0,"And is there a denomination that is saying your free will is unaffected by outside factors? AFAIK it just means you’re not forced to. Let me replace starving kid with hungry kid. One that knows dinner is going to be ready in an hour. Biological factors can influence free will, that’s not against any definition of the word. Me wanting to have sex with someone, to biologically reproduce, doesn’t force me to have sex with them. I have the choice. That doesn’t mean I don’t have free will because my body tells me I should have sex. 

The point about god being able to predict the future was always told to me as “god has a plan” not necessarily a literal god knows everything you’re ever going to do. I don’t think a lot of sects realllllllly believe that since the puritans. But I can’t speak to all of them, I grew up Methodists and only studied religion from a historical POV for my degree so I could be wrong. There’s so many sects but most religious people I talk to don’t talk things as literally as you’re making it. 

If your entire argument is that free will means being completely free of all factors, you have a ridiculous definition. The entire point is that we have all these factors thrown at us, and we’re supposed to make the right decision."
todayilearned,fcrrc5o,t1_fcrqgcs,1577905569.0,"Dude wasn’t even on his high horse, we don’t even know what country he was from. There’s nothing braggadocious about saying the Japanese have a history of ignoring their crimes. 

Also I’m assuming anyone who condemns a country for mass war crimes, also probably holds the opinion that their country should be condemned for awful acts."
politics,fcrp516,t1_fcriej1,1577904738.0,"Being able to predict the future doesn’t counteract someone’s free will. If I put a starving kid in front of a piece of steak and tell him to eat the steak, he’s going to eat the steak. I can predict that based on loads of evidence. Does the kid have the free will to say no? Yea of course, but he’s not going to. 

Would also like to point out no Church I’ve went to preached that god knows the entire future. Kind of doesn’t make sense with Adam and Eve eating the apple, or Satan betraying them. 

If you extrapolate this to god being the one to give us steak, and we’re all starving children, you can see how it will work from a prediction standpoint. The free will talk afaik just means God can’t force you to do anything you don’t want. Which is absolutely true, although he can entice you with heaven, hell, disease or whatever. 

I will say that I believe in the “watchmaker god” idea where basically God used to do stuff but now basically sits on his throne and lets things happen. Makes more sense to me than someone just watching over use doing nothing."

Is it “bad” to get famous off a porn tape. Is it “bad” to show off a life of glamour to children? Is it bad to show off your body for materialistic gain? If “bad” just means a lifestyle you disagree with, then there’s tons of stuff you could say. If your definition is a terrible act, then there’s actually little you could say from what I know about her. 

I couldn’t care less, I don’t watch her and I actually never see her besides Reddit. I will say, I don’t think she’s a monster. I also don’t think she’s a great role model, but celebrities shouldn’t be anyways."
classicwow,fc625xz,t1_fc5eo32,1577470576.0,"Thursday is 3$ well drinks. I buy 3 of these things called reds wicked apples beforehand, 3 is enough to get you drunk, then I just sip on gin and sprites. I go through probably 4 of them in the ~3 hours. I’m a regular and work at a different bar as a side gig so people will come by and offer me shots. 

Even better is Monday’s because it’s 1$ domestic beers. Do the same thing but end up drinking like 8-10 beers. 

We have this guy who I’ll call Greg that offers rides home for the price of gas. He used to be a big alcoholic but turned his life around a couple years ago. Ends up being like 3$ for me and he refused to take tips but I’ll usually buy him Taco Bell.

I have multiple memories of this happening in Silithus and Feralas with the fire and earth eles. Haven’t had any positive interactions with Blizzard the past 5 or so years so not sure if it’s changed or I’ve gotten a bit bitter as I’ve aged"
