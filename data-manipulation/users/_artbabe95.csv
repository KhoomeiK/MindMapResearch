That’s why I follow other creative subreddits like r/ArtPorn, r/Calligraphy, r/Embroidery, r/Drawing, r/LearnArt, etc etc etc and why I I subbed r/Art. But I think the point of my post is that in the broader picture, it’s not only a “me” problem. It affects impressionable people of any gender and I think such high exposure is unhealthy."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff3uz9m,t1_ff2mavt,1579549428.0,"Just yesterday I saw a girl who was fairly fit post a gif of a “Wonder Woman Cosplay.” It was just her flexing in a cheap Party City Wonder Woman costume. These are the attention grabs that perpetuate the objectification of women in art and media. I don’t really blame her though, because we’re all conditioned, deluded, to seek male attention as if it’s an non-renewable resource or a race. Just remember: dick is abundant and low value."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff3ffkq,t1_ff3ega4,1579539961.0,"Hahaha no, it’s much appreciated because it’s not trying to argue with us about something you’ve never experienced. From all of us, thanks for your support and manners :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff3f9lc,t1_ff2za8c,1579539867.0,"I agree. It’s a seriously sad systemic issue that I don’t see changing fast enough or.... just enough at all. 

Yea, now we’re idolizing “thicc” women, but they STILL have a body type none of us can compete with— tiny waist, huge boobs but narrow shoulders, wide hips, thick butt and thighs devoid of cellulite or veins or marks, flawless skin, a lower spine curved by scoliosis, a sharp jawline, the same tiny nose and hands and feet. Those features don’t naturally coincide on (nearly) anyone. It should stay relegated to just a fantasy, something that doesn’t exist, instead of becoming what it is now: an expectation. It drives women away or magnetizes them, depending on how achievable they believe that body is with their financial power and available cosmetic procedures.

Like you said, I also hate that normal looking people, who we could relate to and empathize with, are cast as the “unfortunate-looking friend” or the “unsuspecting one” that becomes the hero. They had just as much potential from the start as their pretty friends! 

We need to start telling both boys and girls that their natural shapes and faces are enough. Self-improvement within their control is always a good thing, meaning maintaining their physical health. But their big nose, their thin lips, the girl’s boyish figure, the boy’s narrow shoulders, is nothing to be ashamed of."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff3dywh,t1_ff38ntd,1579539163.0,"Listen— it’s not about women being drawn. Drawing women, especially powerful ones, is fun and awesome. It’s about the SAME woman being drawn. And it’s about NOT appreciating the diversity of women’s bodies by heightening a single unachievable body type. It’s also about taking away women’s power and grace by making them solely the object of sexual attraction."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff3dr72,t1_ff39yag,1579539053.0,"Oh thanks! I think it’s a less tangible consequence for them, so I can understand why they don’t feel the way we do. Sometimes it’s frustrating because this sub is supposed to be a space for women to talk about how THEY feel, from their perspective, without dissenting comments from men who have never been in our shoes."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff2vcla,t1_ff2utl0,1579525598.0,"Then you haven’t seen enough movies, commercials, or art, because I can think of plenty with either a dad-bod male lead/subject, or a male lead who’s not a looker but somehow dating a woman who’s conventionally gorgeous hahaha. Men are also not often posed in such a way that it shows submission or innocence to cater to a fantasy involving domination or even pedophilia (since a lot of female subjects in popular art tend to have childlike faces and postures but womanly bodies)."

I’ve been toying with some ideas on that front for a bit now, but I relegate art to a hobby since I have a demanding non-art-related career. I’d love for others to jump aboard too. Also, I’d love to extend a thanks to those in r/Art who already post their amazing landscapes, strong fantasy characters, and fine art (life drawings, sculpture, etc) to dilute the “pretty girl” art."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fezzrzl,t1_fezww78,1579463659.0,"I guess that’s still in line with my main point— the masses enjoy mass-produced art of sexualized women, while only small sections enjoy much rarer works of sexualized men, and it’s done in private communities while the worship of scantily-clad Barbies happens publicly and daily. There’s a huge disparity of concentration and attention in those two genres. I never said that art of sexualized men never existed, just that it is not as ubiquitous as that of sexualized women."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fezw8u7,t1_fezvj2j,1579462469.0,"Hahaha yes, that, as well as a post every day or two or three just like it. I think what made me even more frustrated is that as a member of a real military, our uniforms would never, ever fit this way. It’s impractical, far too sexualized for a coed force, and not economical for production. This would never be a thing. Most women in the military, myself included, wear barely-tailored canvas bags as combat uniforms because it’s cheap, practical, and professional."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fezv56r,t1_fezs0ui,1579462061.0,"I mean, women have been sexualized far more often than men for.... forever, probably. I think it stems from the very common male fantasy of innocence and submission. Female fantasies I feel are more varied, or we just don’t feel the same compulsion to show them off to others."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fezuopz,t1_fezr8il,1579461892.0,"There’s nothing wrong with drawing the female form. I take issue with the fact that there’s a homogenous female body type permeating art right now. Women come in tons of shapes and sizes, and fine art/life drawing usually emphasizes this by encouraging drawing a range of nude models (by age, weight, height, bone structure, posture). But popular art hones in on the most classically sexy figure and shoves it down your throat."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fezucyo,t1_fezr8j1,1579461767.0,"I think her figure is a little idealized, but her posture and the implied difference in the myth are really powerful, I think. Overall I really like it."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fezpoz5,t1_fezihqy,1579460103.0,"Thanks for your reply :) I’ve always been a slave to my artistic side, but my career right now isn’t art-related, so for now it’s delegated to a hobby.

My disappointment stems from the utter inundation of the art world with these very similar representations of women."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fezos4q,t1_fezn8vo,1579459781.0,"I see your point. I know that there is a lot of idealization in art, not only of human subjects. And I do understand that art serves as a vehicle for any possible visual idea, and mostly I support sharing these ideas with others through artistic creation. 

But there isn’t nearly as much soft core porn-like material produced by female artists or of men. I feel that it’s not “imaginative” as it is drawn pretty exclusively for self sexual gratification. Not that I think it shouldn’t be drawn anymore, but I think the market is SATURATED with “dream girls” to the point that it becomes detrimental."

SkincareAddiction,fe31crb,t3_enjaaa,1578844979.0,"Hi there! My skin, which is normal to slightly oily and non-sensitive, has made great improvements since following the ScA guides since August and incorporating a couple new products for the past three months, but I still struggle with my forehead. 

I’m in my early 20s and lots of women my age have smooth, tight skin on their foreheads. Mine, meanwhile, is less of a smooth, feminine dome shape, and more of a straight masculine shape (which I don’t mind). As a result, the skin on my forehead is kind of loose and creases very easily if I raise my eyebrows. It is also more textured than others’, that I’ve noticed, even though the skin is clear. 

I cleanse twice daily with CeraVe foaming cleanser and in the morning apply Olay Complete moisturizer with SPF as well as Neutrogena liquid lotion sunscreen. Every other night I treat my redness and texture with The Ordinary 2% granactive retinoid in squalane and 10% lactic acid + HA. Both have seriously improved by skin’s softness and redness, but haven’t really helped my forehead.

Is there a product or treatment to tighten this skin without fillers? I’d like to prevent my forehead from forming deep wrinkles before the rest of my face ages proportionally."
