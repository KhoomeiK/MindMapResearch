DotA2,fff5p33,t1_ffel7b6,1579876363.0,But you cant purge armor which was the original point
DotA2,ffecx9d,t1_ffe9fh1,1579843479.0,To be fair guardian angel is very good. And ussually results in a retreat for the enemy
antifastonetoss,ffch4id,t1_ffcf0gg,1579799342.0,I go to things people literally ignore me or are rude to me. I dont know how thats supposed to help? I try to talk to people despite how rude they are I still try to be nice.  I just dont understand what I am doing wrong.
eu4,ffc778y,t1_ffc0dco,1579793126.0,I dont consider skins to be content. As long as features and DLC and events never get locked we are fine. I know it's a slippery slope but like.... the service isnt for me. I'm gonna buy the dlcs because I play eu4 every month.
ModernMagic,ffc6otw,t3_esoyth,1579792792.0,I used to love modern... then my deck was banned..... but that's fine I built a new deck.... it was banned..... I'm out of money.... I love magic but it's over for me due to finances
MinionMasters,ffc3jhs,t1_ffbex7t,1579790657.0,If you're new you should get a feel for the game first. It's hard to use for more than just timing reasons
Steam,ffc325a,t1_ffc0akq,1579790310.0,It's not out.... which is what I said.... not being out yet you can have a preorder sale as long as you want.
antifastonetoss,ffc2y9y,t1_ffc0en4,1579790232.0,Again I dont hold those views. By all accounts I cant be an incel because I dont even care about sex I want a meaningful relationship. I'm just cripplingly lonely I know it's my fault and shortcomings.
antifastonetoss,ffc2tfw,t1_ffc1o0w,1579790135.0,Exactly. I know it's my own short comings that hold me back. I dont think anyone owes me anything it's just depressing and frustrating
antifastonetoss,ffc03tv,t1_ffbyuul,1579788085.0,"I am in college it really doesnt help me. As I said I would talk more in private messages but I'm not going to get into specifics here. 

Edit. I see I'm getting downvoted. I'm not saying this is everyone I am speaking only for myself. I'm not going in to details as its personal."
antifastonetoss,ffbdiyt,t1_ffbd4x3,1579760745.0,But like... really it's hard to convince someone they have worth. And like... comics like this dont help. As I said it's super hard to get out. Where are we supposed to go.... I wont get into personal details to much but I really dont have good social outlets.
MinionMasters,ffbcvip,t1_ffb0mbt,1579760026.0,Screaming scrat is very hard to use. Def not a good first legend
antifastonetoss,ffbcfpp,t1_ffbbfr0,1579759546.0,In there defense it's really hard to get out there especially if you have had rejection.... I think alot of incels just hate themselves and do it to cope... if you're lonely and feel worthless what are your options? I mean I'm not an incel but I understand it. Not feeling like you're good enough and wanting more.... it isnt a bad thing.... I dont want harm to come to anyone and dont think horrible things like incels I just struggle to socialize. I dont think its women's fault for not liking me.
Minecraft,ffbc4q8,t3_eskuia,1579759220.0,If you're having fun you're doing it right.
Steam,ffbbd1g,t1_ffarnuf,1579758406.0,Umm buddy one of the other things in the TOS is about this. Games are allowed to be on sale and preorder and may have a period after launch of sale  then need to wait 8 weeks to be on sale.
BikiniBodhi,ffbba1b,t1_ff8lirk,1579758316.0,To be fair it's super hard to design a new weapon. If it's a rifle it will be super close to another gun. If it's a shotgun it's in the dumpster if it's a slug maybe it would be ok but we already bosg and kaids so
Steam,ffacx2i,t1_ffaabd5,1579732590.0,What about it?
RedDeadOnline,ffa46oe,t1_ff99729,1579727539.0,Yeah I almost filled my max supply bar which I didnt even think was possible.
reddeadredemption,ff5y784,t3_ermpsp,1579614097.0,I killed npcs and looted them till I had a 20$ bounty still above neutral karma and I was back at max by the time I logged off the next day
btd6,fettftq,t1_fes4mjj,1579379867.0,Wait what?
DotA2,fen8bfe,t1_fen5h4g,1579279172.0,Is this your primary account? Did you leave alot?
AffinityForArtifacts,feclfef,t1_fechrw2,1578976811.0,Now I have no idea what to do as i really dint have the money to get ANOTHER deck
AffinityForArtifacts,fechg20,t1_fe8t695,1578974005.0,It was my second after twin.....
MonsterHunter,fe985as,t1_fe8fdfm,1578935224.0,I played for 5 hours in a 3 stack on release day not a single DC during hunts.
pyrocynical,fe08yzd,t1_fdyd8hb,1578806378.0,I havent asked I'm just patiently waiting. I want longform content doesnt have to be petscop
Rainbow6,fdqynkr,t1_fdqkau6,1578676882.0,I mean I disagree because I think the skin could have raised more money. For example the mercy skin raised like 12 million... sooooo
RedDeadOnline,fdqkoki,t3_emr9ud,1578668986.0,How do you get a solo lobby
wonderdraft,fdmh8hf,t1_fdmh1rp,1578549822.0,Bless you for helping me. You have no idea how frustrating it was to be unable to place bridges where I wanted
wonderdraft,fdmgcoz,t3_elxyxd,1578548968.0,Quick question you seem to have done it a few times here but is there a way to mirror or rotate assets?
Steam,fdfvu70,t1_fdfcdd2,1578371578.0,I assume it's so games dont go on perma sale to give the illusion of discount. And then rarely go on real sale
RedDeadOnline,fd4u6yk,t1_fd4phdk,1578171154.0,Yeah most people are pretty chill was my main point.
RedDeadOnline,fd2ukjs,t1_fd2mnom,1578151789.0,"I just get on mic and say ""hey wanna trade emotes for daily"" I also did that for the ""Join a posse"" just rode up on a player and asked to be invited for the challenge"
katawashoujo,fcug2fy,t1_fcu6nl6,1577980106.0,I assume someone was just playing O trail and named chars after them then decided to draw it.
wholesomememes,fcti095,t1_fcthe2l,1577943938.0,Unfortunately those things dont help. It feels impossible to exercise I feel so exhausted at all times...
wholesomememes,fcth4so,t1_fctgwih,1577943104.0,It's been 6 months of looking... almost a year in reality....
wholesomememes,fctf3rf,t1_fcte87y,1577941244.0,Nah I'm usa but I cant sleep because of my anxiety it's why I'm browsing reddit.
wholesomememes,fctdnph,t1_fctcgs8,1577939961.0,If course I want to be better but I feel worthless and helpless.
wholesomememes,fctdmq5,t1_fctcf77,1577939938.0,I am good at nothing... and doing things feels impossible. If I had my way I would do nothing
wholesomememes,fctdkqw,t1_fctc725,1577939890.0,Have tried so hard to see doctors none will see me
wholesomememes,fctbviy,t1_fct0hiu,1577938444.0,Yeah but there isnt a good treatment.... I feel alone and like a failure and there is no one who cares. Which feeds into the anxiety and depression. How do you stop feeling worthless...
DotA2,fcr6j06,t1_fcopaov,1577897511.0,Wait it no longer stacks? Does that include halbird or no?
learndota2,fcacpsi,t1_fc8oe76,1577566876.0,Imp claw is meh. But the other 2 I have seen be nutty.
Warframe,fc5iu2f,t1_fc5e9rl,1577458785.0,Does anyone rush time gates? They are the one thing really annoying
dndmemes,fc1hemt,t1_fc1eyf1,1577318849.0,That's not reality lol
darksouls3,fc0cx9q,t1_fc0c8p2,1577287260.0,Because we know playing well is impossible for you so you need to bully new players.
