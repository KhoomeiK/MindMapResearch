AskReddit,ff0v7kk,t1_fev9mav,1579472602.0,"Actually, kinda yes... it is the art of Letting your body decide it's own action based upon external stimuli. Removing all concious thought on the action, which, in theory,  allows you to think of other things.  Something about your sub conscious reacting before your brain can process the action. By thinking about moving her foot she lost ultra instinct.  The same way kakarot can't trust his body to react"

AskReddit,fezjsue,t1_fewduf6,1579458080.0,"I experienced this out of place, bone deep sadness two days before my brother had a car accident that proved fatal after 3 weeks.  He never woke from his coma. It was mother's day and my wife and I had a party for our mother's and siblings and grandmothers.  My brother was the last to leave and after we hugged and he left I broke down uncontrollably sobbing.  I kept telling my wife that someone in our house that day was going to die and that our family would never be the same. I pray to never ever experience that again.  It honestly felt like I was in the presence of death itself."
