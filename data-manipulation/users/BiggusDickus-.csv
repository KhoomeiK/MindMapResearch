You cannot ""cancel"" or ""modify"" a transaction with Nano once it has been sent. The same is true with Bitcoin or any open, permissionless, decentralized blockchain. Nano is NOT a blockchain, but that is not relevant to your question.
 
Once you legitimately send it, that's it.  The transaction is on its way.
 
Nano is much faster than Bitcoin, and feeless, and better in pretty much every way, but the principle is true for both of them. Transactions are permanent and irreversible.
 
Now, of course, you could reverse or modify a transaction by breaking the ""rules"" and launching a 51% attack.
