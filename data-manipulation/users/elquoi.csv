u_FreshBeaver,ffeh2ww,t3_esrmqf,1579847737.0,You’re so beautiful that... Aphrodite might be plotting against you. But good gods... I hope she’s not.
gonewildaudio,fdutaat,t3_emdziv,1578738478.0,"I al typically too embarrassed to comment on audios; and FDom is not typically my go to. However, I _an_ partial_ to oral. And... well, this production was fantastic.

Firstly, you have an incredible voice and I can’t stop trying to place your regional accent. Regardless, point is: Beautiful voice.

Secondly, this is the closest I’ve come to being able to experience ASMR. The way you emphasize that hard k in cock... right in my ear (but not loudly), the .... tongue sounds? I’m not even sure what to call them, but I found you’ve near replicated that heavenly feeling of having a tongue tease one’s ear. The lip licking... this audio just made me melt in all sorts of ways (even some personal ones)

From content through production? Just fantastic. (In my opinionated opinion.)"

Personally, I wish I was bi. At least logically. Or pan, I suppose.

But, as a sadly 98% straight man, the only thing I can add is... being straight doesn’t automagically free you from the bittersweetness of your friends and acquaintances starting families whilst you’re alone.

Obviously, I’ve no idea of the gestalt of your situation, but if you can find a way to .. not abandon your dad (people are awful and, honestly, if he said that, my intuition suggests he already knows, but is putting off the reckoning with his own internalized narratives) , but to be more independent and maybe even seek out a location that’s more accepting of your nature?

I don’t know. My parents weren’t keen on my ex for various reasons. (Not to the same extent, obviously.)  But feeling like she was behind me (as I was equally behind her) gave me a certain reassurance.

Not sure if this ramble was at all useful."
u_FreshBeaver,fdp1ci8,t3_em87tz,1578617662.0,That post definitely gave someone a confusingly wonderful heart attack. And a priapism.
