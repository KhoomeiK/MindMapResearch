mildlyinteresting,ffqkvqx,t1_ffqi2mu,1580137350.0,Probably better for me than the bottle of wine I had last night. And both take me to a time I felt like a drooling uncaring happy idiot
yarntrolls,ffl8gpo,t3_ett1li,1580036256.0,"I feel personally attacked!

Really though, try this with tubular cast on... With 350 stitches (largest size sweater)... And then mobius your next attempt... That piece isn't even in timeout anymore. I had that fucker incarcerated. When it finally came time for parole I realize I started it when I was 150ish pounds heavier. 

On an an unrelated note, I'll be having a bonfire soon."

Coffee,fffypnt,t1_fff6x1d,1579894710.0,I do. I was just hoping there wasn't a step I was missing that you just happened to overdo or something lol. Very sorry for your v caffeinated loss
Coffee,fff3aw2,t1_ffexcg5,1579874558.0,Wait... Just got an ap and thought I was going inverted. Is there a time when you're supposed to pull on the plunger slightly (though obviously not enough to pull it out upside down) while the grounds are in it? Or was that the mistake?
knittingboners,ffc0wyv,t3_esne2r,1579788713.0,Okay. Screaming hot. But does it bother anyone else that such a warm sweater is left open like that?! Feels like it would defeat the whole purpose....

When people start drinking wine, for instance, most think it should taste like (or only like) the overly sweet grape jelly flavors of Concord style that most even a year in would never even give a second glance to. With time though most appreciate and enjoy the more subtle and dry flavors.

Personally I would rather be stone sober than drink a concord now. That is, I find it worse than nothing at all (as do most who aren't super sweet drinkers). Yet I understand its necessity in my journey towards appreciating pinot noirs, malbecs, etc."
