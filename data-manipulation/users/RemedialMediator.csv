science,fevo47h,t1_fevfhbm,1579399597.0,It's literally not. Do not believe anyone in this thread. It's absolutely bullshit
science,fevnems,t1_feur1lw,1579399320.0,"This is so misleading. You can find cheaper if you just look. Hospitals charge more because of the overhead.

todayilearned,fem67xn,t1_fehmbsj,1579241195.0,"But it's not true. At all. Science isn't malleable. It's just not something that can be done with heat.  This is literally propaganda to scare Russia. It's not possible.

I love the downvote, but show me a picture, any picture from that plane, or the sr71.... Any proof you have, I would love to see.

It's simply not possible with an atmosphere. Tell me how it works, or just show me a picture.

I'm telling you, this is bullshit. You do whatever you want with that info, but that plane, and sr71, cannot defy physics. You are dumb if you think this is real.

I'm sorry that you are a moron, and I'm more sorry that 6000 morons upvote shit like this. It's a testament of how stupid this world is right now. You are a great testament of stupid.

Congrats!"

Watch this get down voted. I have worked with the very best lens makers on earth, and even they say that heatwaves are the biggest problem with this story.

It's so hard to watch reddit upvote things like this, that are scientifically impossible, and give this shit website credentials to keep spewing bullshit. You might as well want to be anti vax, and spread the word to your followers"

You have that in most countries on the planet. You can try to act like this is confusing, or easy, or just common sense. It's not. Not in any country right now.

We all know that the USA needs a lot of help, but to shit on us to make your country's problems seem nominal, is pretty ignorant. We have some saving grace, and it's not apparent right now because we have a moron in charge."
