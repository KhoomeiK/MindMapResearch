In XP open ""Control Panel/Region and Language Options."" In the advanced tab set ""Language for non-Unicode Programs"" to Japanese. You may need to separately install the Windows XP East Asian Langue pack depending on the ISO you used to install XP.

Alternatively, just find a Japanese Windows XP ISO and set that up in a VM. If you've installed Windows XP a few times before you should be able to figure out without needing to understand Japanese."

If you mean bootleg streaming sites, a VPN isn't worth it. It's not worth the time busting end users, they only go after the operators. If you're talking about using a VPN to get around geofiltering on a legit foreign service it would be helpful to know which service you're trying to access."
