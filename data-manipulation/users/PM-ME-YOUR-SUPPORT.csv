pornfree,fe5gxvq,t3_ensi0u,1578869307.0,I would also join that
pornfree,fe5eyus,t3_ent979,1578868637.0,That's actually a pretty average age for people who start to quit on here. He'll have plenty of time to get back to normal. And he definitely will. I believe in you guys.
selfimprovement,fe5empp,t3_enqa4b,1578868476.0,"I also quit Adderall, so I had the same type of feelings, with respect to that. It mostly involved me realizing that I didn't have many friends, because I treated people coldly when I took it, and would lose my sense of humor. I actually do have ADHD, but it's kind of mild at this point, because I think I've grown out of it a little bit. I just think it's important for you to trust that it's a beautiful thing to finally be who you really are. You'll gain new friends who will like you for better reasons, and you'll probably be able to be more affectionate and funny in your relationships too.

It's boring for now, and you probably have a lack of energy, but it gets better. A lot better. You just need to give the people around you some time to readjust to who you are now. You'll start enjoying new, healthier, and simpler things too in a matter of no time. Let your brain adapt to it. It'll probably take months. But trust me on this."

pornfree,fe2lgpk,t3_eno5e4,1578839953.0,Why does this matter to you? I don't see how any real answer to this question could benefit any of us on this subreddit
NoFap,fcwt89q,t3_ejc30c,1578036653.0,Did something trigger you?
NoFap,fcwos3y,t3_ejb49m,1578031926.0,Good question. I wanna know too.
selfimprovement,fcwfgmm,t3_ej9jfm,1578024264.0,"The most influential books for me were:

- Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman
- Man and His Symbols by Carl G. Jung
- The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger"
pornfree,fcwbgnm,t3_ej8g4f,1578021543.0,"Have patience, because that means you're getting better."
pornfree,fcw47kw,t3_ej7peq,1578016764.0,Glad you did it. Those women didn't give a shit about you.
selfimprovement,fcvy2lf,t3_ej28x3,1578012716.0,"Why don't you feel like texting women? Sorry if this is blunt, but do you watch porn all day or anything like that?"
NoFap,fcvsr1e,t3_ej6mm9,1578009266.0,"It does make sense because it's an effortless way for your brain to get more reward chemicals. The button is there and you always have the option to press it.

Don't."
Stoicism,fctsmeo,t3_eivqrg,1577957378.0,Yeah... We hear enough of it second-hand on Reddit and by word-of-mouth anyway.
confidence,fctqjge,t3_eiuci2,1577954341.0,"If you don't feel like you deserve it, work harder to make yourself into someone who you feel DOES deserve it.

Edit: And this should be up to you and your standards, rather than what others necessarily think. Do what you'd personally love to do with yourself."
pornfree,fctkpo5,t3_eitvhf,1577946799.0,"You should just know that despite all of this, you are still a man. PMO gets the best of us. This was really well written and you seem like a great guy, and I wish you the best. My gut says your best days are ahead of you if you just have patience."
confidence,fcr3tuk,t3_eijlru,1577896380.0,"The thing is, in order to stay happy, you still have to care about what SOMEONE thinks. You have to feel like you're doing something for someone.

However, that ""someone"" right now is just yourself.

So do more things that you want, rather than what other people seem to want."
confidence,fcjs4qu,t3_ehkfwi,1577701910.0,I'm currently just trying to do this nofap thing lol
Stoicism,fcjs01f,t1_fcjrxkb,1577701720.0,I think most people get thoughts like that. You don't even have to control them. It's the crazy people who act on them.
Stoicism,fcjrrzv,t3_ehk7w1,1577701390.0,"Before you do anything at all, just ask yourself:

- Are these idiots really worth the mental space?
- Would I ever bother to confront any of these people with the issues I have with them?
- Are these issues even solvable?
- How much can I ignore them and get away with it?

And if you decide that you still want to do something, ask yourself:

- If I burn a bridge with this person, will it cause more annoyance for me in the future than what I'm already experiencing?"
pornfree,fcjhyzp,t3_ehi5gc,1577688303.0,"I mean, I'm also on nofap so I try to avoid this shit altogether........ But I'm sure the written stories are better, especially if you're a guy, because men are highly visual"
NoFap,fcizp9x,t3_ehey24,1577673689.0,What are your current social media and entertainment habits?
selfimprovement,fcihuex,t3_ehcqbp,1577662791.0,Be careful about trying to be your authentic self though; don't forget about who you think the best version of yourself is. It's a balance.
NoFap,fci2cad,t3_eh6uei,1577656908.0,What is your past and present relationship with social media and entertainment?
pornfree,fci1q9f,t3_eh9wqx,1577656694.0,It's not as big of an empty reward as nutting. But it is an empty reward nonetheless.
NoFap,fci0jhs,t3_ehc1go,1577656307.0,"I've never made it that long, but I've heard that it gets a lot better. Your brain will readjust to this lack of dopamine and start resensitizing itself to the simple things instead."
NoFap,fchzn71,t3_ehbwgh,1577656015.0,"Realize that the people who you follow on the alt twitter will never ever give a shit about you as an individual. So you should delete that alt account, or purge your following list.

Realize that playing with the toy rewards your brain with dopamine for absolutely no effort, which numbs you from the excitement of working out, talking to girls irl, etc. So you should throw away the toy.

Realize that what you do on the spare laptop is a part of you that you are shameful of and wouldn't want anybody else to know about, which implies that you KNOW it's bad for you. So you should delete the bad folders, or even reset it to factory settings and sell it.

Realize that NONE OF THESE THINGS HAVE ANY MEANINGFUL VALUE TO YOU and that they actually HARM you as well."
NoFap,fchyb8g,t3_ehbt7v,1577655552.0,"Took me just two weeks, the first time I made it that long, to get hard at a lot more things.

I should warn you though: don't test yourself. Don't touch yourself to see how fast it gets hard. Don't imagine things to see how fast you can get hard. Don't look at soft core things to see how fast they can get you hard. This will slow the process. And it triggers you. It's quite the slippery slope."
NoFap,fcd43if,t3_eh3e0r,1577606109.0,"They happen more if you watch sexual content throughout the day, whether or not you fapped or edged to it. Not sure if that's the case with you, but thought I'd let you know if you don't already."
