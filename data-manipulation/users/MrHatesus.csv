can you tell me more about the breeding of cherry shrimp? i have a spare 20 Gal tall tank and I wanted to set it up. I really enjoy lots of plants, sand and substrate flooring with rocks and hopefully some wood with plants on them. do you have a good suggestion for stocking? I would LOVE tons of little shrimps (how do i avoid little shrimp getting stuck to the filter? i do have a sponge cover on my other filter to avoid it sucking up my adult shrimp but would the suction make baby shrimps just get stuck against it?"

I hate it when people play music on trails and I'm from a nature heavy town.

But when you have the same speed as someone and they are a little ahead or a little behind it can be so so so grating on the ears.

Also of the 4 people I spend significant time with, they all notice and comment that I have certain things I do with the labret in certain situations so I'd say it's a fair point that my FRIENDS pick up on it.

When you wear something in your face for that long you tend to grow habits around it. And when you have oral fixations that lead to deep tissue scarring in both cheeks from nervous chewing it kind of is a personality thing. Not that you could have known that previously but yeah. It keeps me from chewing my cheeks out from stress. It keep me from wanting to smoke. It keeps me from grinding my molars together. And it's a great way to stop the drunk person from kissing you when you press your lips together and they effectively impale their lips on a small spike (yes this has happened on multiple occasions)

I think its total BS and if they want you to do all these things they need to foot more bills.

All in all ins your choice. They cant MAKE you drive a car they buy (also if you dont get to pick and it stays there when you leave why the HELL would you be paying insurance and whatnot on it? Is it your car or theirs and you're just a driver for them?)
