AI is used in some aspects in modern society, e.g. traffic patterns etc. Getting a perfect society is not as easy as you make it sound however, because there is no single one size fits all.

You don't need an AI to determine legisation, or taxes, I also don't care for Donald Trump, i'm also not American, so I don't really care who you support.

I feel like your understanding of AI is extremely rudimentary, you can't just give it data, and say give me this outcome, you actually need to provide what you want to come out at the end.

You ask an AI for a perfect society, you will end up with some form of genocide.

If you can't do it with current AI, I suspect it isn't going to happen in our lifetimes, superintelligence AI is a long way away.

It is much cleaner, and better for your lungs (No plant matter burning)
