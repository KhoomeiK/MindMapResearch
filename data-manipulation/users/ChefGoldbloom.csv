relationship_advice,ffjsgl1,t1_ffj3c8h,1580005716.0,"This is good advice. Spend some time being single (I'd suggest at least 6 mo or longer) and being OK with it. Work on building platonic relationships. Learn to be OK with yourself. I know its cliche but if you dont love yourself you cant have a healthy relationship.

I'm hardly an expert but from personal experience co-dependency is (or at least can be) a symptom of an unhealthy need for validation from another person. Basically you need someone else's love and attention to feel good about yourself because you arent getting that from within.

You're aware that you have a problem and want to fix it so you've already taken the first step. Others have recommended some reading on the subject so that might be a good place to start. If therapy is an option, that is another good choice. Talking through this stuff with a professional is often very helpful.

And when you do date someone again, make sure you take it slow."

Pokemon's greatest strength is that its *pokemon*. The world of pokemon is something that you cant replicate in another property. Pikachu and co are deeply embedded in pop culture at this point. You could come out with a much better *game* similar to pokemon and not be able to compete.

manga,fdkfpty,t1_fdk7r3z,1578502900.0,"The biggest problem with American comics is they're mostly all super hero comics  focused on characters that have been around for like 60+ years.

This is less an issue with changing writers than it is the nature of trying to write about a character that has been around for longer than most of us

relationship_advice,fdhi1j9,t3_el6wkz,1578423079.0,"Not sure there is a way to bring up your partner's weight to them without hurting their feelings. It's a sensitive subject for most. But I think it is something you need to talk about, if you are considering sharing a future with that person. 

It's not fair for one person in a relationship to just let themselves go because they are sad, depressed, comfortable, whatever.  A healthy relationship requires constant work to maintain. That includes working on yourself, part of which is your health and fitness.

Personally I really dont buy into the using age as an excuse for your weight. It's normal to put on a few pounds as you get older, sure, but there are plenty of people in their *sixties* in great shape. Saying your fat because you're 38 is complete bullshit.

All that said, my advice is to bring this up with him in a tactful, respectful, but frank manner. Let him know that you are concerned about his health and that it is something that effects you negatively. Something like "" hey I'd like to talk to you. You've been gaining weight recently and it concerns me. It makes me worry about our future together if you are going to continue this pattern without doing anything to address it. I'm worried about growing older with someone who isnt going to take care of their health.""

He was 1-2 hours late, once. This is something to be mildly annoyed at, not something to start a huge fight about.

Healthy relationships require partners to have interests and connections outside of the relationship. They also require compromise. He should be able to have some space and time without her without it even being an issue. Codependency is not a good thing.

My advice to the OP is to absolutely not budge on this. You are not asking for much, shit this is not something you should even HAVE to ask about. If the genders were reversed everyone would be calling the SO a controlling psychopath and telling you to break up.

You dont owe him any explanation other than ""I dont feel that way about you."" Set a boundary, let him know if he is doing something that makes you uncomfortable.

relationship_advice,fd7c3o8,t3_ek861m,1578202195.0,"You can't fix an addict and you certainly arent going to be able to ""do something"" about your mother's drinking problem. I know this sounds harsh but that is a completely delusional idea. Learn more about addiction, maybe do some reading or talk to a professional. Have you talked to your therapist about this? Because if so, I'm surprised they haven't already told you something similar.

While I think it's great that you have come to terms with and been able to forgive your mother for her abuse, that doesnt necessarily mean that its healthy for you to have a close relationship with her and you certainly  shouldn't feel obligated to. A relationship with a self destructive alcoholic, especially one who is your prior abuser, is going to be extremely emotionally draining and will bring much stress and negativity into your life.

I completely see where your grandmother and aunt are coming from and I mostly agree with them. From what you've said, your mother has not even begun the process of recovery and has shown no inclination to. There isnt anything you can say or do about that, she has to come to that decision herself. The most you can do is let her know that you care about her and that you'll be there for her if and when she is ready to begin.

I'm also not so sure why you are so adamant about this being mostly your father's fault or even what that has to do with anything. He might be an abusive enabler, and she might need to leave him, but however horrible he may be that does not absolve your mother. She is an adult and is accountable for her own actions and behaviour. I'm not saying none of it is his fault, but it seems like you want to shift all of the blame off of your mother and on to him. 

And I definitely don't think you should be *living* with her. I can't see that being a healthy situation for you whatsoever. Don't set yourself on fire trying to keep someone else warm"

Dont feel guilty about not being attracted to someone who is just letting themselves go. 

 In my view, being overweight is not much different than a substance abuse issue, just with food rather than alcohol or other drugs. Nobody will criticize you for leaving an alcoholic, but because of how normalized obesity has become you will have some people telling you you are being superficial or it's your responsibility as a partner to help her through this and be encouraging.

 Die Hard is a *perfect* action movie. Everything about it is just so tight, there's zero fat. It takes itself just seriously enough to avoid being corny while still having moments of levity and humor. The characters, the dialogue, the setting (nakatomi plaza is arguably the best setting of any action film), the pacing, the attention to detail and continuity. everything about the film just works wonderfully. 

It's like a great pop song. It's following a formula and is far from avant garde. It's made to have a wide appeal. But it works within those confines so well and executes the formula so well that it transcends being just a genre piece.

3 is good but theres a reason the first is one of the most influential films of all time and most people dont even remember the 3rd. It's a much more sprawling movie with a much more contrived plot. It's still *really good*, but it's not even close to the original in any measure from a critical or historical perspective.

Nerd mainly implies being really interested in, well, ""nerdy"" hobbies and media (like LARPing). This is totally fine, being a nerd is not a bad thing. Being a nerd does not preclude you from also being ""cool"". You as a person are not defined solely by your hobbies and interests, although many people feel the need to identify themselves based on these things.

""Neckbeard"" is a much more pejorative term. It implies someone who is a nerd but is also severly lacking in many other aspects of their life. Poor social skills, bad hygiene, fat/out of shape, overly obsessive, ect.

Hobbies primarily a way to enjoy & express yourself and meet people. They dont define you as a person. Those are traits like compassion, empathy, intelligence, curiosity, ect.

 You seem really hung up on how people perceive you based on you interests. My advice is to not worry about it and own it. Like personally I could think LARPing is the lamest, most boring thing in the world.

relationship_advice,fdhi1j9,t3_el6wkz,1578423079.0,"Not sure there is a way to bring up your partner's weight to them without hurting their feelings. It's a sensitive subject for most. But I think it is something you need to talk about, if you are considering sharing a future with that person. 

It's not fair for one person in a relationship to just let themselves go because they are sad, depressed, comfortable, whatever.  A healthy relationship requires constant work to maintain. That includes working on yourself, part of which is your health and fitness.

Personally I really dont buy into the using age as an excuse for your weight. It's normal to put on a few pounds as you get older, sure, but there are plenty of people in their *sixties* in great shape. Saying your fat because you're 38 is complete bullshit.

All that said, my advice is to bring this up with him in a tactful, respectful, but frank manner. Let him know that you are concerned about his health and that it is something that effects you negatively. Something like "" hey I'd like to talk to you. You've been gaining weight recently and it concerns me. It makes me worry about our future together if you are going to continue this pattern without doing anything to address it. I'm worried about growing older with someone who isnt going to take care of their health.""

Healthy relationships require partners to have interests and connections outside of the relationship. They also require compromise. He should be able to have some space and time without her without it even being an issue. Codependency is not a good thing.

My advice to the OP is to absolutely not budge on this. You are not asking for much, shit this is not something you should even HAVE to ask about.

I know this sounds harsh but that is a completely delusional idea. Learn more about addiction, maybe do some reading or talk to a professional. Have you talked to your therapist about this? Because if so, I'm surprised they haven't already told you something similar.

While I think it's great that you have come to terms with and been able to forgive your mother for her abuse, that doesnt necessarily mean that its healthy for you to have a close relationship with her and you certainly  shouldn't feel obligated to. A relationship with a self destructive alcoholic, especially one who is your prior abuser, is going to be extremely emotionally draining and will bring much stress and negativity into your life.

I completely see where your grandmother and aunt are coming from and I mostly agree with them. From what you've said, your mother has not even begun the process of recovery and has shown no inclination to. There isnt anything you can say or do about that, she has to come to that decision herself. The most you can do is let her know that you care about her and that you'll be there for her if and when she is ready to begin.

I'm also not so sure why you are so adamant about this being mostly your father's fault or even what that has to do with anything. He might be an abusive enabler, and she might need to leave him, but however horrible he may be that does not absolve your mother. She is an adult and is accountable for her own actions and behaviour. I'm not saying none of it is his fault, but it seems like you want to shift all of the blame off of your mother and on to him.

Dont feel guilty about not being attracted to someone who is just letting themselves go. 

 In my view, being overweight is not much different than a substance abuse issue, just with food rather than alcohol or other drugs. Nobody will criticize you for leaving an alcoholic, but because of how normalized obesity has become you will have some people telling you you are being superficial or it's your responsibility as a partner to help her through this and be encouraging.

 Die Hard is a *perfect* action movie. Everything about it is just so tight, there's zero fat. It takes itself just seriously enough to avoid being corny while still having moments of levity and humor. The characters, the dialogue, the setting (nakatomi plaza is arguably the best setting of any action film), the pacing, the attention to detail and continuity. everything about the film just works wonderfully. 

It's like a great pop song. It's following a formula and is far from avant garde. It's made to have a wide appeal. But it works within those confines so well and executes the formula so well that it transcends being just a genre piece.

3 is good but theres a reason the first is one of the most influential films of all time and most people dont even remember the 3rd. It's a much more sprawling movie with a much more contrived plot. It's still *really good*, but it's not even close to the original in any measure from a critical or historical perspective.

""Neckbeard"" is a much more pejorative term. It implies someone who is a nerd but is also severly lacking in many other aspects of their life. Poor social skills, bad hygiene, fat/out of shape, overly obsessive, ect.

Hobbies primarily a way to enjoy & express yourself and meet people. They dont define you as a person. Those are traits like compassion, empathy, intelligence, curiosity, ect.

 You seem really hung up on how people perceive you based on you interests. My advice is to not worry about it and own it. Like personally I could think LARPing is the lamest, most boring thing in the world. But could care less if you are my friend and that's what you're into and it's not something that is in any way going to preclude me from getting to know someone. Being passionate about things is cool"

Just mind your own, if it's really that big of a deal to you find another roommate situation"
relationship_advice,fc6vfsj,t1_fc5bgl5,1577490518.0,"Why is this post even here? Karma farming? Like what kind of advice do you even *need* in this situation, just dont fucking talk to her, like you've already been doing, FOR TEN YEARS."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fc6s9zr,t1_fc5lm5l,1577488195.0,"Wow would never want to date someone like you! Develop *a personality*. 

Being in love doesn't mean you want to spend every fucking second with someone, christ"
WatchPeopleDieInside,fc6s13q,t1_fc5jfj8,1577488012.0,"Yep. So many bitch made dudes in here talking about ""well what I find works"". WHAT?! Just tell her you aren't interested, holy shit. 

And if you *are* interested then guess what? Its not an issue in the first place!"
WatchPeopleDieInside,fc6rif0,t1_fc5psib,1577487633.0,"Here's what I find works: ""hey I'm not interested in going shopping with you."" 

I've seriously never been in a relationship where this is an issue and I absolutely cannot understand any of the men in this thread who do this shit. Why the fuck would you go clothing shopping with your s.o. for hours if you don't want to? I'm not going to invite a girl over while I play video games for hours and she watches (*unless that's what your into*).

""Shopping"" isnt a fucking interest lmao. Spending money isnt a hobby."

These countries, for some reason, also have significantly less gun related crime and *mass shootings*. Weird, I wonder if there is some sort of connection between the two?"

Games,fc10ikg,t1_fc0xwij,1577304774.0,"Yeah that's why vertical slices have had this issue for the past 20+ years, on every single platform, because of games being on consoles. Not because they are extremely polished parts of unfinished games that are supposed to represent the creative vision of a product to media outlets and consumers in the best possible light to generate interest/hype rather than being representative of an actual finished product. 

Holy shit you're dense."
