TripSit,ff84jf4,t3_es4okz,1579665797.0,"Hi friend. What you’re experiencing is normal. Probably different than what you’re going through, I’ve certainly shared your feelings of being completely overwhelmed while peaking alone.  The thing is: you’re not alone.  Maybe nobody is in your immediate proximity, but we’re all on this planet walking each other home.  This experience will end, and *usually* we can find something beneficial from the tension/discomfort it can cause.  That’s called change.  You can’t transform (even a little) without discomfort. 

If it’s not terrifying or traumatic, lean into it or talk about what your experiencing with us.  If it IS terrifying or traumatic, change your environment first — sometimes as simple as changing rooms and playing different/calm/upbeat music (I like the happy calmness of Tycho) or going for a stroll outside around the block (caution!) — then focus on taking deeper breaths and tell another human being how you’re feeling. Here is welcome.

Just remember: this is temporary. You’re not alone. Some discomfort is necessary for growth. Surrender is the only way to obtain real peace. And you are loved."
pics,ff4okq3,t1_ff4j95e,1579568668.0,"Appreciate that.  I should clarify. We have a good relationship and a lot of love for each other.  All mistakes in the past are truly water under the bridge for us.  Just distant as neither of us are great at keeping in touch frequently and neither of us really enjoy talking on the phone (to anyone).  Would prefer if we could visit each other, but, y’know, capitalism."
WTF,ff4bccq,t1_ff46pco,1579559636.0,"This is simple, common-sense, pragmatic advice.  Thanks, I will do this.  Although, TBH, I spend most my commute in a 8 lane highway with my fists death-gripped at 10 and 2, so this might mean having one hand over the horn at all times. I’m a bit traumatized (sincerely, I’m in treatment) from years working in a trauma/neuro ICU; most people don’t realize how they spend a good amount of their day just seconds away from death - I’ve watched otherwise healthy, *young* people succumb to death from a punch during a fist fight, a slip on a patch of ice, playing sports, and a fall from tripping while stepping over the curb of a sidewalk.

If any of you or your loved ones drive aggressively, drunk, or while texting, please keep in the back of your mind: that behavior contributes to the leading cause of death in children."

WTF,ff45zc7,t1_ff3y9w9,1579556285.0,"I can confirm this. I’m a very gentle, conflict-avoidant person in real life due to history of abuse (which is both a helpful trait and a harmful trait). I never use my horn out of frustration or if someone cuts me off (which is inherently dangerous) but I’ve been able to adapt without being scared of an accident.

Had an oblivious young woman make a right turn across two lanes of traffic (four lane road) recently and I only avoided the accident by crossing into narrowly empty oncoming traffic and passing her.  Didn’t even cross my mind to honk during the 5 seconds prior while my brain was saying, “ is she go to...?...  nah, she’s not going to. Omg she IS going to... oh fuck, oh fuck...  PUPIL DILATION ACTIVATED”

That is one of several times where I’ve realized a few minutes after the fact, “you know, it might have helped if you used your horn to communicate your presence.”"

Those aren’t the words of someone who hates people.  Fears people, disappointed by people, or resents people, maybe?  But that’s not a heart that’s filling up with hatred.

I see you. I see what kind of person you are when no one’s looking. And I love you and care about you, brother.  You will have so much to give to people who are suffering some day when you’re well, if you so choose.  I hope you do. The world needs more people like you.

If you want to talk about your addiction, I’m here.  10 months sober from a pretty severe addiction after nearly killing myself with insulin.  I won’t tell you that life will always get better.

TripSit,fems3az,t1_femp4ch,1579268009.0,"Ketamine can do that, especially if you take too much: the so-called “K hole”.  Like most drugs, there are risks.  The upside is that ketamine, LSD, and psilocybin are all either in clinical trials or approved by FDA for treatment of anxiety, depression, and PTSD.

Would you perhaps have access to buy adderall?  That would be a safer option and you wouldn’t have to worry about street contam.

And it lasts longer than cocaine which really only lasts for 30-60minutes."
TripSit,femll35,t1_femi7vb,1579261520.0,"I say this with love, but if you’re at risk of a mental breakdown, anything from your psychiatrist but a hard NO would be bordering on malpractice. Even if he is open minded. 

I’m a harm reductionist and I’m 11 months sober.  I understand that people will do risky things and why. And if they are going to make decisions that aren’t necessarily best for them, how can I reduce harm from those decisions?

From what you say, it sounds like there is a lot of risk involved for this.  Can I ask what draws you so heavily toward cocaine?

If you decide to go off your SSRI, the only safe way is to taper down, reducing the dose once a week or once every two weeks.  Suddenly stopping can cause an unpleasant experience called ssri discontinuation syndrome. And even if tapered off too fast or as recommended, it can trigger a mental health issue.

Important to note that cocaine will have a negative effect on the neurotransmitters that regulate mood,  anxiety, and contentment which will also raise your risks of a breakdown."
