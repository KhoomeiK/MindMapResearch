Schiff is a confirmed liar.  Big lies.  On multiple occasions.  Lied to America about having incontrovertible collusion evidence he was keeping to himself.  Lied to everyone about his interactions with the whistleblower, this lie was confirmed and admonished by the Washington Post, one of your favorites.  Just two examples, there are more.  Am I wrong?  Did he do this?  Tell me I'm wrong.  You can't.  Because reality is reality.
