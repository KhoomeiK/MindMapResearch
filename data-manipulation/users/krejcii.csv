shittyrainbow6,fffsa56,t1_fffdsh7,1579890700.0,Yup. The top tier players get to shit on all us while us lowered ranks while we pull out our hair. It’s dumb unbalanced match making and I haven’t seen Ubisoft comment on anything about it. It’s been like this for awhile and makes the unenjoyable

When Smite first came to Xbox I can’t tell you how addictive I was to buying those expensive as chests for skins in that game. I sunk a lot of money into that game. I lost my account on Xbox & got banned for life on my gametag which was probably the best thing to happen to me. I haven’t touched that game since and won’t be games with that kind of reward system. It’s dangerous when you’re a dumb adult

Please get cameras and watch them religiously. Once you have proof call the cops and keep your dog inside until then. Next time it might be rat poison and not chocolates. 

Definitely keep a camera on the mail box as well. Messing with peoples mail is a federal crime I think. Most importantly don’t let the police talk you out of it. A lot of cops are out to problem solve situations & might not take it seriously. Stay with it 100%"

Rainbow6,feuxbjy,t3_eqfrrg,1579390895.0,I’m becoming to hate this game more and more everyday on console. All the top players are using mouse and keyboard and since ubi is doing nothing about it more and more people are making the switch to it. I can’t even play causal with my friends and not go against stacks of diamonds and plats while we’re silver and gold players. We never get matched against are own skill level. Rank is getting just as bad. Stacking 4 smurf accounts with one plat to get diamond. They need to up the requirement level for rank way higher. At least 60 so these dudes can’t flip accounts every season.
