So do you agree that it's ok to teach a kid that certain actions make people respect them less?"
aww,fgjy1e7,t1_fgj0dre,1580853621.0,"Your own words. ""Demeaning is anything that lowers a person's dignity"".  Dignity is defined as ""The state or quality of being worthy of honor or respect"".

So the question becomes do I think that making a kid put his nose to the wall makes him feel like he didnt deserve honor or respect. Sure. I can accept that. 

So he did a bad thing and his parents taught him that doing such a thing makes him lose the respect of others. I really dont see the issue there."
