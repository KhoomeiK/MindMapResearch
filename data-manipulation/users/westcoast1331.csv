AskReddit,ffjogi3,t3_etts4s,1580002988.0,"I went/still going through this very rough stage--I had been misdiagnosed by a psychiatrist and given this heavy dosage of medications. As a result, I became very agitated and withdrawn because of the medications. Eventually, I broke up my small family, because I felt like I was ruining everyone's life. 

When I took myself off the medications, I was forced to assess the damage and hurt that I caused. It was tough, remembering the small family I once had and how I had driven away many of the people who once loved me. 

Because of those feelings, I was desperate, so I reluctantly took LSD. When I took it, I remember I started to picture my small family and I became overjoyed, thinking about how happy I could be. I pictured life through this perfectly geometric hologram. At that moment, my mindset flipped and instead of thinking of reasons for life to end, I started thinking of reasons to live. 

As a result, when I'm down, I think of that memory. I think how the possibility of happiness lies within me-if I'm willing to fight for it."
LawSchool,ffgw495,t1_ffgw0y4,1579916562.0,"On a Friday? That’s reason to drink. It’s early in the semester, don’t know how you’re still sober at this point."

Chair darts anyone?"
LawSchool,ffgvqky,t1_ffgml17,1579916286.0,Yes.
LawSchool,ffgh7m7,t1_ffg7iim,1579906161.0,Try Ithaca. haha
LawSchool,ffgh700,t3_etg9s4,1579906150.0,Five years out and cold-calls still give me chills.
SandersForPresident,ffddlgr,t1_f48xvk9,1579818648.0,"I am not trying to come off as combative. Honestly, whipping my student debt would enhance the proper restart of coming out of a multiyear depressive state.  However, as amazing and lifechanging as the student debt plan sounds, there just seem to be too many impediments to his plan really being able to forgive student debt (i.e. anti-deficiency act and the impeachment trial changing the congressional balance)."
LosAngeles,ffbauxh,t1_ffb8pno,1579757868.0,You win!
LosAngeles,ffagf0n,t3_esj7sa,1579735147.0,That car is everything.
Cornell,ff9la4k,t1_ff9jjfz,1579715382.0,That’s undeniable.
Cornell,ff9l84m,t1_ff96lmd,1579715350.0,"Go to moonies in the commons and the students are pretty welcoming. There are also a number of bars in the commons as well. 

Regarding venues, when I was at Cornell there was the haunt and another venue near the commons. 

Overall, collegetown is cool, but it can become a lame routine, so try to mix it up."
depression,ff8fqkp,t1_exsrc35,1579676506.0,But your experience is anecdotal and seems like a generalization. LSD helped me to move forward after 3 years on cymbalta.
theivyleague,ff8c6rn,t1_ff7z2c1,1579672580.0,"I agree that the school someone attended should not define a person. However, you cannot argue that you are not exposed to some exceptional students (which top publics are unable to attract). 

Academically, some of those schools are vastly superior to any ivy."
Cornell,ff8bzgh,t1_ff88kya,1579672375.0,"Same here. It took two years for me to realize that Ithaca was kind of awesome. I live in LA now and I miss Ithaca every day. There's a lot to do in the city, but you have to get out of the Collegetown bubble sometimes.

The commons has some awesome bars and the IC students can be pretty chill. There are also some decent venues in the area."
theivyleague,ff7y7xp,t1_ff76ckr,1579661192.0,"He’s not asking about the academics. I agree, you shouldn’t judge someone on such superficial factors."
theivyleague,ff6snj1,t3_eryzu2,1579634054.0,"If it’s private, I feel that it’s of the same stature.  The first thing I learned at an ivy institution was that education is only one component. I went to an ivy for law school and attended UCLA for ug."
depression,fewuhvn,t1_fbk8qoh,1579419684.0,"I apologize for those pushing psychedelics on you. But the studies are promising and in my own experience, what they did was beyond incredible and  it’s one of those things that makes you want to share how it changed you."
depression,fewnuh3,t3_crbiml,1579416187.0,"In some sense knowing that there’s something that can provide that ray is the ultimate antidepressant for me. Also, in that moment of tripping, I start to really allow myself to picture myself as being in a fulfilling and happy place, thereby allowing me to get things done. 

IMHO."
depression,fewnp5e,t1_fejc7ec,1579416012.0,Was it the right setting? I felt like lsd brightened my life in a way that’s mystical. It was the first mystical I’ve ever experienced. It did things for me that therapy would have taken years to accomplish. In some sense I felt like I started to forgive myself and unpack the grief that left me feeling depressed.
depression,fewnhey,t1_exsrzgf,1579415766.0,Yeah. There’s a research institute coming out of Johns Hopkins and NYU that’s very promising in treating treatment resistant depression. Psychedelics might revolutionize mental illness treatment.
depression,fewndiu,t1_exss9eu,1579415645.0,"LSD might have saved my life after my SNRI. They finally allowed me to start to unpack grief that prevented me from moving forward in my life—but not a complete or perfect solution. 

But my experience is obviously unique and I would never recommend that someone get off of something that could harm them. But anecdotally, the potential of psychedelics in combatting depression makes me hopeful. I almost get ghost-bumps thinking of what it did for me in one night."
RationalPsychonaut,feo4bhk,t1_f8qr0ut,1579294983.0,It's not. The science is becoming more and more apparent. It's no longer limited to anecdotal experiences.
TwoXChromosomes,fekdf85,t1_fek916t,1579197718.0,"Your stance seems just as extreme as the other posters. Undoubtedly, all women should have the right to choose if they have a child. But to say that there is nothing sanctified about the Gestational process comes off as insensitive and reactionary. I really hope this debate at some point becomes a little more measured. 

Also, how many of the women in the survey had children after abortion? That would be interesting to know."
getdisciplined,feib1iq,t3_ep2pqe,1579134320.0,"LSD and a lot of crying helped me to get really start to burst out of my depressive state.

Drugs aren't always bad. But the coke is always bad. I've yet to hear any story that ends positively with coke."
AskReddit,feia85w,t3_ep7tm4,1579133774.0,don't do it.
Cornell,fdlx3tx,t3_em1nkn,1578534588.0,Can you translate what you just asked?
Cornell,fdlwpbs,t3_em0ys2,1578534314.0,Grade inflation.
barexam,fbf1nub,t1_fbeygii,1576799262.0,"How are you already at 29.6%? Here I chugging along at barely 5%. Some of those outline reading assignments are crazy. For example, they assigned the whole Torts outline as the reading assignment for the day."
