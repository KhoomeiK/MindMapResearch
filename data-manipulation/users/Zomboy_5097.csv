dayz,ffh8q2d,t3_eti9lc,1579926333.0,"Wow I must be lucky. I knew, and saw some footage of people who encountered the bears, but I haven’t seen one myself yet."
dayz,ffacc8q,t3_esjcuh,1579732193.0,I haven’t seen one either. It might be one of those things that they are planning on adding but haven’t yet or it might have been something removed last minute.
aww,fep2og2,t1_fep2nou,1579310784.0,Agreed
aww,fep1f2e,t1_feozlut,1579309985.0,"The article says “Tanner and McPherson are not to be confused with the Bumfights producer who got kicked off Dr. Phil when he showed up dressed as Dr. Phil. That was “Ty Beeson,” an “investor” to whom McPherson and Co sold their rights...”  so I think you may have gotten the wrong article"
MiniLadd,feoxlho,t1_feoxjdf,1579307585.0,As long as mini’s in it I’m good
dayz,feo18ck,t3_eq51a7,1579293689.0,"Nice Man those are rare finds, last one I found was 6 or 7 months ago and there were like 4 people fighting over it"
thewalkingdead,felqt72,t1_fellxjw,1579228685.0,"That’s why I said there’s only bad and worse, Rick wasn’t a saint but he wasn’t as bad as Negan which is why I wanted to know if people thought he actually changed."
thewalkingdead,fe639cw,t1_fe630rs,1578880798.0,"Exactly. If they would have put it more scenes with Showing Negan’s compassion, like with Carl for example I think they would have an easier time trying to make his character more like able in the group"
thewalkingdead,fe625k8,t1_fe61wdl,1578880093.0,"Agreed but it’s all a matter of perspective I suppose. Because if we were with Negan’s group from the beginning we would have seen Rick’s group as bad, so essentially in this world there is no right and wrong, good or evil only bad or worse"
thewalkingdead,fe5kkhj,t1_fe5du9a,1578870612.0,"I agree completely, I just feel that if people gave him more of a chance he could change for the better like he did with Aaron in S10 ep3"
