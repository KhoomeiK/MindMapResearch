So I get the bright idea to spray my ceiling fan panels, lite them on fire, then turn the fan on for a light show.  I do this and 2 seconds in like any liquid being spun around the liquid is going to run to the edges. Before I know it little liquid fire balls are shooting out in every direction  from the ends of the ceiling fan. One hits me in the face. I turn around to look in the mirror to see the damage. Looking at my face I feel heat on my back. I look out from the mirror. Nothing but flames and smoke! I turn to the window and open it up. I grab all the blankets and throw them out the window.
