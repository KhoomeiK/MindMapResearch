AskReddit,fcji0hj,t3_eh4nfa,1577688348.0,"Two random strangers.

I was at knotts with my mom and I was kinda going around as I could.  I went on one of the rides alone, the one that goes up and down (I forgot what it was called).

These two women (I think they were girls, sorry if I’m wrong) were talking about the ride, and they looked like they were on a date.  They seemed SUPER cool in my opinion and I wanted to talk to them but I was too scared to.  At one point one kept going on about it how scary the ride seemed, so I told them that it wasn’t as scary as it looked and that it was better when you got it over with, since that’s what happened with me.  I think I even mentioned how pretty it was at night.

They asked me to ride with them so I said yes, I was seeing my mom right after the ride and I had a purse with multiple sharp objects, in a crowd.  I was pretty confident I was fine.

I got on with them and they were cool, and I felt nice for getting to maybe help them feel better about something.

After the ride they left and I wanted to talk more but it felt awkward to ask.  I don’t remember too much but I do remember loving the time I spent with them.

If you are reading this and think that it was you I’m walking about, I high key miss you guys and hope it’s going well!"
