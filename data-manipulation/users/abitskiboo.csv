Fortunately the colour, at least, was maintained. Although they don't work and don't exactly line up with the cats' functioning eyes (the pupils don't dilate and always look a tad ""off""),  at least the colours match now, which I think we can all agree is the important thing."

No one knows how the (alleged) event played out. We only have one person's claim, an absentee cyclist, and the insinuation that the original poster would assist in pressing charges by corroborating anything this cyclist (absent and ""fine,"" remember) wished to say in a statement, but only by making private contact with them.

Fuck that mentality.

This guy claimed the cyclist was ""doored,"" causing the overzealous mob to call to mind whatever personal experience they've had with ""dooring,"" evoke that image, then project guilt and down-vote me, the only critical and sensible voice here, simply out of spite.

We do not have a video of the event, a second corroborating witness, or the alleged victim themselves.  All we have is some guy who, bizarrely, refuses to even write a detailed account of what he witnessed.

Well,  I have the highest contempt for people who are willing to rush to judgment with that alone: because it amounts to nothing.

What's particularly amusing to me is that when I first requested that the original poster provide a more detailed account of what he had witnessed, the community upvoted my comment quite a bit. Only after he refused and I pursued my line of questioning did the many uneducated bike zealots, particularly r/Fiverdrive , know to sound the alarm like Donald Sutherland at the end of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEStsLJZhzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEStsLJZhzo)), alert the others non-thinkers, and attempt to silence me. I don't know about you, but the down-voted comments are all the more tantalizing to me.

Just yesterday I watched gleefully as an unmarked police car ticketed a dozen or so drivers who disobeyed the sign that told them not to turn between certain hours. Fuck those drivers. They run red lights all the time, and plus, a week ago Friday, one jutted out in front of me when I had the right of way: I slammed my fist off his fucking hood in the classic ""I'm walkin' here!"" fashion as I and the hoard of people behind me proceeded around him.

Cyclists?  They do it too, and when you prorate the numbers, they do it more, as they are not ticketed. The only consequences are their own injuries and possible deaths, which they are more often than not the cause of themselves.

Now that you're clear on that point, try thinking critically rather than making knee-jerk conclusions. How could a cyclist colliding with a door be considered negligent, you ask?  Distracted driving comes to mind.  Motorists are guilty of it, as are cyclists.  How about impaired driving?  Maybe this cyclist just left a bar with a few cocktails in him to warm him for the cold trip and he careened into a door he would have easily avoided sober?  Maybe he said he was ""fine"" and absconded because if the authorities were to be involved, they'd arrive at that very conclusion?

""Please blow into this sir, I have detected the strong odour of alcohol on your breath.""

I don't know.  You don't know.

Though when you add to this all the reasons listed above, it is a recipe for disaster.

So yeah, I agree with your conclusion: I'm happy to give a fuck you to the person who (allegedly) opened the door (into which the cyclist allegedly collided) if they were absent-mindedly tapping on their stupid phone like most people are, but as I stated, check out the posts on buddy's profile: I wasn't making up the fact that he has a history of publicly bitching about this very topic.  Add to that his reluctance to give an account and I can only conclude that he's gunning for this motorist, whose plate he apparently has."

Also, thank you for the compliment!  But I didn't say that, the judge did.  : )

I keeeeed, I keeeeed.  No, that was a dig, for sure.  No, people should absolutely be able to cycle in the winter.  Though, the streets are sloppy, narrower due to the snow, visibility is decreased, stopping times significantly reduced, etc.    


I believe that driving a (relatively speaking) protected motor vehicle is not advisable most days *this* time of year, but a graphite or aluminum-framed bicycle?   I mean, transit has its issues, but you're out of your mind if this is your viable alternative, in my opinion."

Though what I will say is that cyclists as a group (bless 'em), particularly the urban variety, being the more vulnerable road-goer, tend to lay all fault with the motorist.  Reason?  The cyclist often comes out of a collision a little worse for wear than two tons of steel.

Furthermore, there have been many, *many* examples of injured or, sadly, dead cyclists in this very city who are preemptively deified on social media by people like the original poster here, often without a shred of evidence.  Then, after the results of the police investigation are made public, they have been proven to be at fault themselves.  The most egregious example was probably the pre-dawn west-end cyclist who ran a stop sign...in the dark...wearing dark clothing...and stereo ear buds.  He careened right into the path of an oncoming taxi with the right of way (yes, he was ruled to have been speeding, this taxi, but that's irrelevant) and killed.

So all I want here are the facts, and buddy won't even give an account.  It's suspicious.

We should also not dismiss the importance of the way he wrote the title, implying with a (quasi) verb that the cyclist *was doored.*   This reads as an aggression and as of this writing, he's given neither testimony or evidence to back this up."

Plus, you heard the judge."

Okay, well I guess I will have to opine on this one using the circumstantial evidence alone.

Your post history reveals a clear bias on matters of winter cycling, so I suspect you have an axe to grind.  By your own account, this alleged ""dooring"" (which implies negligence and perhaps even malice on the part of the motorist) occurred at 5:25pm.  I will also submit into evidence that on this day, January 24th, 2020, sunset occurred in Ottawa at 4:57pm.

One of the few details you provide are the cyclist's ""oversized tires,"" but what of their reflectors?  Lights?   Bell?  Were they abiding by the speed limit?  Observing a safe following distance and proper spacing from the car?  Was the car in motion or was it stationary?  What was your vantage point and distance from the collision?   Why are you hesitant to give an account?

Your honour, ladies and gentlemen of Reddit, the facts are these (1): The night was dark, as mentioned above; (2) The author of this thread (and alleged witness) has a documented history of being a winter cyclist himself, posting testily about trivial cyclist-motorist infractions in the past; and (3) in a recent ""NSFW"" forum, posted a depraved photo of what we can only presume is h---

*Defence: ""---OBJECTION, your honour!  Relevance?""*

*Judge:   ""Sustained.  Watch yourself, councillor.  The jury is instructed to ignore that last.  Miss?  Remove it from the stenographic record, please.""*

...I'm sorry, judge, I'll watch my step.

In conclusion, an alleged witness who is unwilling to write an account of  what he claims to have seen can only be considered unsound, if not ""hostile.""  His reluctance now will undoubtedly lead to embellished fictions later on, should the need arise, though by saying nothing, he is protecting himself from later contradiction.  Furthermore, he is an observable antagonist towards motorists.

*Judge:  ""Agreed.  As any sensible person knows, you don't ride a bicycle in a Canadian winter.  Plus, this phantom cyclist, if he or she even exists, said that they were 'fine.' Case dismissed.""  (Clack)*"
