GenderCritical,ff9mihm,t1_ff9gv3t,1579716107.0,"So many people have been use! My boyfriend was horrified when I told him that teenagers can take hormones and have surgery and even younger kids go on puberty blockers. These are serious life changing decision made by people who might not even have a driver's license. If women in their 20s and 30s have trouble getting a tubal but teenage girls can take hormones that sterilize them something is really wrong with how we handle informed consent.

Btw I'm all for sterilization of consenting adults. Birth control has side effects and isn't the best choice for all women."
GenderCritical,ff3p1h4,t1_ff3fu2f,1579545780.0,"Yes. The drugs in PrEP are also used as treatment of HIV (truvada) and they can mutate and become resistant to those drugs if exposed while you are taking them to prevent infection. If you take them properly you are extremely unlikely to get HIV, so if you do get HIV you probably missed a dose or otherwise took it improperly, so the virus can become resistant. Drug resistant HIV is incredibly common because the virus can mutate quickly. There is also something called lateral gene transfer that means that a virus with the resistant gene can pass it to other copies of the virus (it doesn't only transfer by reproduction). It's really a nightmare."
GenderCritical,ff33dju,t3_er6lnj,1579532636.0,"A few things:

* Examining your spin is normal but doesn't require total toplessness. You can just lift up your shirt.

* Same for listening to your lungs. They can listen under your shirt.

* You are too young to need a breast exam. When you are older you can get one from a female nurse or doctor. It's rare for teens to get breast cancer.

* Normally a doctor will let you dress/undress in private and only uncover what is necessary. For example if your back is being examined your chest should be covered. If you are having a pelvic exam or ultrasound they still give you a drape. If you are having a breast ultrasound they only uncover that breast and only for the duration of the ultrasound.

* Normally you have the option of a female doctor and a male doctor will have a female chaperone in the room. You may want to see a male doctor if it's an emergency and no one else is available. I've seen a male gyn once and he was actually really awesome, but I'm much more comfortable with women. I remember having a male ultrasound tech and they asked me over and over if I was okay with that. No one has ever sprung that ok me and just assumed if be okay with it.

* The doctor shouldn't touch you to ""help"" you move or disrobe. That's fucking creepy.

I'm really sorry. You should talk to a woman you trust, possibly a female relative, teacher, counselor at school, etc. It's not normal. Trust your creepdar. It's also not normal for your mom to brush off your feelings about when you are or aren't comfortable."

GenderCritical,ff31kfi,t1_ff2weuv,1579531240.0,"Judaism is weird about marriage. There is a contract called a ketubah that requires the husband to provide clothing, food, and sex (opportunity to get pregnant) plus money in the event of a divorce. Women can ask for a divorce. However that's all they can do, there is no way to force the man to grant it. Even now a religious Jewish wish woman can wind up chained to her ex if a legal divorce goes through but he won't sign a religious divorce or ""get."""
GenderCritical,ff2xzeo,t1_ff1ttk7,1579528203.0,Plus if you take it wrong and get HIV the entire world is now at risk of catching a medication resistant strain of HIV and the resistant genes can be passed to previously non resistant HIV!

GenderCritical,ff1zgp9,t3_er3lpn,1579489793.0,"I saw that you don't have other good gym options. I work out at home. When it's nice out I  run, ride my bike, or walk. If it's not nice or not safe outside (late at night, rain, etc) I put my bike on a bike trainer stand so I can ride at home. I can even watch TV while I do this. A bike trainer stand is about $100. I also do some body weight exercises, you can look up full body circuits online. Can you cancel and figure out if some kind of home exercise works for you?"

fatlogic,ff05k8e,t3_eqob2b,1579465408.0,"I can totally see where feeling like you need to exercise but also feeling like you can't because it's too overwhelming would lead to anxiety. She needs to see a therapist and maybe ask a friend to work out with her, starting with someone that's well within her abilities. Having a friend there makes it a lot less overwhelming. I've used support from friends to help with all sorts of situations that caused me anxiety. She also needs a therapist to help her with her narcissism - someone who can tell her that this reaction isn't ok and she can't blame other people for her poor mental health. Avoidance makes phobias worse. Blaming other people who are just going about their life makes phobias worse. Exposure and therapy really do help."
GenderCritical,fezzlsk,t3_eqzkwi,1579463595.0,"My step sister has a baby from a surrogate and is expecting another soon. She also has an au pair (live in nanny from another country) and used to have a night nurse. It's so exploitative. Step sister is loaded. The surrogate... Is not. She's poor, she has children to provide for, she needs the money, and I doubt she knows all the risks. She is treated with contempt by my step sister. I think I'm the only one who thinks this is a huge problem. I'm not close to my step sister at all in part because I feel disgusted that she keeps having children and then paying other women (very little money) to birth and raise them."
GenderCritical,fezvcs6,t1_fez5uj6,1579462140.0,"PrEP is a big deal. You need frequent tests to prove you are still HIV negative because if you aquire HIV on PrEP the virus can mutate and become resistant. It can cause long term damage to your organs including bones, kidneys, and liver. It costs a lot of money and may not be fully covered by insurance ($20k). For these reasons it's almost exclusively used by people at high risk: gay men, prostitutes, and IV drug users. It would be very unusual for a lesbian to take PrEP because HIV is rare in the lesbian community and lesbian sex doesn't have a high risk of transmission. Risk is highest for unprotected anal sex and is... Very very low for oral sex, fingering, etc. It's a life saving drug for people at high risk. Lesbians are at very low risk.

Edit- part of this is because it's very hard to get HIV. Single exposure risk is low (compounds over time/exposure). Condoms do a great job of reducing risk. Risk for anal sex is much higher because it causes small tears in the rectum. Most lesbian sex doesn't cause genital tearing along with exposure to fluids that carry HIV. It can, it's just not common.  It's a valid question though. I mean the point of the meeting was to ask questions like that... It's terrible how they treated her. I would say that no one needs PrEP unless they have risky activity / are in a high risk demographic, have sex with someone in a high risk demographic, or have sex with someone who has HIV. Most lesbians aren't in any of those categories but I'm sure some are. Just because lesbians aren't a high risk group doesn't mean that some lesbians are not at risk for other reasons. For example you can be a lesbian who injects drugs, is a prostitute, or has an HIV positive girlfriend. That doesn't make this a big lesbian health issue. It just means individual risk varies. I think we really really need to talk more about lesbian sexual health though."
GenderCritical,feyj9e6,t3_eqp1a7,1579446209.0,"I think my peak trans happened when a lot of my mom binary and trans friends started telling me that I'm trans because I like math/science and don't ""feel like a woman."" I bought into it for a minute! But then I started taking to other women, primarily older women with children and I found out that tons of women don't ""feel like a woman."" We feel human. We want to be seen as human. That doesn't mean anything is wrong with us. It doesn't mean we need to change out bodies, clothing, paperwork, etc. What it means is that ""woman"" is a biological category not a feeling. I saw how eager the trans cult is to recruit people even though they know recruiting like this doesn't exactly improve anyone's life. I'm so sick of random people telling me I need to be as miserable as they are. I don't always love being female and I don't always love my body but my solution is to empower women so that being female sucks less, work out so I feel strong, etc. Not to cut off my breasts and take shots and build a ""penis"" out of my arm, stomach, or leg. That's the opposite of a solution."

I wasn't able to do one until I started training specifically for chin ups and then pull ups. You can do it but if you are a woman it probably won't happen unless you train for it specifically.

GenderCritical,fenl0vp,t1_fenft5o,1579286951.0,"The all female meetings are for the modeling branch of a scientific organization. We all have a background in a hard science with slightly different specialties and areas of expertise. I'm young and new to the field so my job is mostly to listen and analyze data/program the model. I am not the one making the final call on what factors we use or anything like that. The goal is to 1) fill in areas where we lack data and 2) be able to show how different factors would be expected to change the system.

Most scientists in my field are pretty liberal and some of us are religious but not fundamentalist and none of us bring up religion at work. Like I know I have a Hindu co worker because she's mentioned holidays a few times. I think that's a perfectly fine context to bring up religion.

 Your situation sounds like a nightmare. We're pretty ethically and culturally diverse... I can't imagine anyone saying something like that at work. We have so many immigrants from all over the world, different religions and ethnicities... That's a strength. You'd be fired. I know we have a really conservative administrative woman but she rarely brings politics up and it's never been racist, just the kinda typical ""don't trust left wing media"" thing.

Unfortunately the higher up you go the higher the percentage of men. There are tons of women until you pass middle management. I remember a few months ago the minute my boss (male) left a meeting it was just women and they were all like... We need more women in management."

Planned Parenthood says male is xy only and xxy is intersex but they aren't biologists or geneticists and might be using a more layman's definition. Intersex society of North America says they are intersex. On the other hand Wikipedia says it's a male chromosomal disorder. The really important thing is that it doesn't make you transgender nor does it mean that biological sex isn't real. It's a type of sex chromosome disorder not a third sex."
