He's turned the GOP base into a personality cult who worships him and laps up every lie and deflection he spits out. I agree that a bad economy usually results in incumbents being removed, but Trump could blame a recession on the Fed/Deep State/China/foreigners/Hillary and redirect the anger of his supporters. The average Republican voter is already getting little to negative economic benefit from his policies, yet his base holds strong."

movies,ffhb2qv,t1_ffgq45j,1579928459.0,"I love that Star Wars is so divisive a series that whenever I mention that I didn't like the new movies people reflexively boo me and tell me to shut up. Like, not even just on reddit, I've had people IRL ask me for my opinion and when I offer a negative one they changed their mind and didn't want to hear it. If you can't hear a divergent opinion about your ""favorite"" series you are a fucking NERD (and that's coming from me, someone who knows what a Bothan is).

I walked out of TLJ because it had a big gaping plot hole in the middle of the movie's major conflict. Now I know some people don't give a shit about consistency in their plots, and things can ""just happen"" and they keep on happily watching, but for me it's like metal grating on metal. If a writer wants me to take their story seriously then I expect that they will also take their story seriously, it's as simple as that.

Not that anyone cares, but here's the plot hole: TLJ opens with the First Order and the Rebellion engaged in a space battle. The advantage leans towards the First Order, so the rebels order a retreat and jump into untraceable hyperspace.

This is when the First Order springs their trap by revealing they have created a way to track ships through hyperspace. Gasp! Now the rebels can't escape and are consigned to trying to find a way out of this predicament while they slowly run out of fuel. This is presented as the main conflict for the film. Tensions are rising as the clock ticks down for the Rebellion...

Or is it? Why doesn't the First Order spring the obvious second part of their trap, which is to then send other ships through hyperspace to intercept the Rebellion cruiser? Oh right, because the whole conflict is just a contrived device meant to create a sense of peril while also allowing time for sub plots to develop.

This is shallow writing. Convince me otherwise."

Music, like all art, is subjective."

I'm sure there are tones in whale songs that are too low for our hearing to register. Or consider the upper pitch of a dog whistle. We created our music to be heard at the wavelengths we are capable of experiencing, hence the reason why only we can appreciate it."
