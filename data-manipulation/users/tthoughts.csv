But.

I follow both this subreddit and some of the popular trans subreddits, so it gives me a certain perspective on it. I think it's perfectly rational that the trans community would be wary of detrans, because they've more likely than not been told one way or another that their body image and gender identity are wrong. So there's an intense push back to make sure that people who identify as trans can feel safe and admired for who they are and not who people want them to be.

But the reality is that if there's people who are going to be trans, there will also be people who detrans. 

Standard practice in the psychological community has been, in the past, to really spend significant time in therapy and counseling to be certain that someone is trans so that they don't later regret their choice and become detrans. But, while, for a lot people who are trans, a more expedited path is a godsend, it inevitably bears the risks of what you point out. It means there will be more people who transition, are encouraged to do so, only to discover that it's not what they really wanted.

I'm not sure how much can be done to prevent it, to be honest.  Yes, making sure kids love their own bodies and reinforcing that can maybe help some of them answer the question of their gender before they transition, but others won't realize it until they've started.

In my opinion, the fact that spaces like r/detrans exist is exactly what's needed. While I wish everyone in the trans community could be more tolerant, the fact is that detrans people might make them feel vulnerable and thus lend itself to a trans person labeling detrans as trans hate. But them saying it doesn't make it true. You are who you are and everyone, trans, detrans, or otherwise, should be able to accept that and support the you that you are."

amiugly,ffuy3i8,t3_ev2vzd,1580251547.0,"You certainly look healthy. The pictures you have of you smiling are a stark contrast to the others. There are maybe some things you could do to enhance your appearance, but you're not ugly."
BDSMpersonals,ffs806q,t1_ffs3wi2,1580175396.0,r/amiugly and r/Lolita because of a poorly worded comment in amiugly. I prefer to converse with people since appearance is subjective and a lot of the people that post on there have self-image issues that have little to do with their physical appearance. A couple of people decided that because of my posts in r/BDSMpersonals that I must be trying to find and groom underage girls (in spite of the fact that in more than one of my personals posts I've mentioned that I'd be skeptical of anyone under 20 and would prefer 25+)

Edit: which is to say, it's really easy to check post history and make assumptions. That being said, some of the posts in her profile raised an eyebrow."
BDSMpersonals,ffr38a6,t3_eupphd,1580149483.0,"My assumption is they got scared by the ""broken"" in the title and your past history of being abused? I'm unsure. You seem like a lovely lady and it would be nice to make more friends, but I've already got my ""best"" friend, so I'm fairly certain I'm not what you're looking for (we share a lot of interests though!)

Good luck."
