Science is incredible because anyone can learn how to do the tests that prove the existence of evolution. I’m not an archeologist, but I could become one if I chose to. Same goes for just about everyone"

cursedcomments,ffm9bni,t1_ffm3dv9,1580050878.0,I completely agree. That and evolution are my biggest qualms with religion. They state they don’t believe in evolution. ??? It’s literally been proven! You can prove it yourself!

reddeadredemption2,fffrkw8,t1_fffqyhx,1579890267.0,It is hilarious. It looks like I’m riding an overgrown deer. Even funnier is the fact that her hair disappeared after I put my saddle on a different horse. That horse basically stole her hair (when I put it on his hair suddenly turned black)

Whatcouldgowrong,fehjc87,t3_ep47t7,1579117718.0,This is why you shouldn’t pull dogs off the street without having them checked out by a vet or another professional trained to handle them. If you tell them he/she is a stray they’ll test them different ways to see how comfortable they are. Often times it just takes some TLC and they’ll make wonderful pets. But that’s not always the case

insaneparents,fehifwq,t1_fehc4ea,1579117194.0,"Exactly. I haven’t gotten the flu shot since I was little, but I’m fully vaccinated. The flu constantly changes, and there’s multiples strands at the same time. Therefore, you may be protected against one or two strands of the flu, but what if you’re infected with the third? I’m scared of needles, so I avoid them where I can. I’m lucky enough not to be part of the vulnerable group, so I don’t get the flu shot"
