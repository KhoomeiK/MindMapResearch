AnimalsBeingJerks,ffjjwe1,t3_etqeza,1579999897.0,The way the brown dogs looks around after eating the blueberry like ‘what are you looking for?’
AskRedditAfterDark,ffjibt6,t3_etsk3k,1579998856.0,With the right guy I like giving them. Though I have a sensitive gag reflex so I can’t have his dick in my mouth for too long so I tend to do a lot with my hands and tongue instead. Its more that I like having control over him and giving him so much pleasure then the actual dick in my mouth part.
aww,ffhy38z,t1_fff8snv,1579958872.0,A video of a couple of seconds points out he does this all the time? Wow. That’s a bold statement there.

aww,ffgn4xw,t1_fffmxfs,1579910112.0,I only have this with paracetamol. And those taste disgusting when they desintegrate on your mouth so I end up puking

IAmA,ffemd5t,t3_ery077,1579854296.0,"This whole post is one big giant joke. Why even do an AMA if you wont comment on the actual problem here which is the nitrogen crisis. You people keep blocking the highways because you won’t change and point your finger at the flying industry which in fact are making some changes. While you are the number one pollutor in nitrogen and ruining the ground we stand on for insects and plants. Why not invest in our land to try and avert global effects like sea levels rising. Especially since we’re a country that are already below sea level. Stop trying to be the best in everything when being the best has such big consequences for our future generations.
What are the plans for getting our country safe for these generations to come?"
CozyPlaces,ffd162z,t1_ffbt10x,1579811378.0,With someone waiting for you on the bed too?
RATS,ffc64lg,t1_ffc28xo,1579792421.0,"Thanks for all the tips! 
There was a little house on top but the roof seemed a bit sharp and one of the rats kept lying on top of it and scratched its belly so I took it out for a bit and searching for a good new house. I do have a hammock in there and they found a good hiding space at the bottom of the cage for now. 

I will put a box in there for the time I don’t have a house yet. Thanks!"
AskMen,ffbi7bs,t1_ff9in0h,1579766463.0,My husband usually says I’m just like a cat already so the accuracy of this doesn’t really surprise me.
