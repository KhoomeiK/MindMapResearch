I can't even get fresh air when I open my windows unless I'm careful the smokers aren't out there or else smoke comes straight into my home. Management doesn't care as long as they're '25feet away from building' - um wind blows it right into my place...anyway, cat box is in a closet with the door partially open for them, only I clean it and as far as baths I read it makes almost no difference as dander stays in everything for months even after washing. I finally have a vacuum. Idk what a HEPA filter is for the central AC or vaccum is tho.

And what are sublingual immunotherapy drops? He went through months of immunotherapy shots but even at the slowest series he sneezed 20 times in a row one time and was constantly stuffy even with medicine.
