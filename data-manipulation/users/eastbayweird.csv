Around 5 years ago the city passed an ordinance that would have made it so anyone feeding people in a public space would have to get a permit (costing $100s) and have their kitchen inspected.  Since it's just homie in his own kitchen he was worried he might have to shut down since the fine was like $1000 for feeding w/o a permit. 

He ended up having to move his operation out of downtown to a park in a unincorporated part of town and he hasn't had any problems since. Still feeds around 20-30 people a week on average, he does double that around holidays.

Now while the 0 and 100 points are tied to physical phenomena making them not arbitrary, as far as I can tell the decision to base the scale on the freezing temperature of a particular type of brine is totally arbitrary.
