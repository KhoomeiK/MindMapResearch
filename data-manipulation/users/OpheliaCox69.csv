A. Hopes the benadryl kicks ASAP so i don't have run my scared ass across the room to the bathroom?
 B. Get my grown ass up and stroll casually  the room, like the adult I allegedly am, and not totally afraid of the dark like some small child? Also, monsters aren't real, right???
C. Attempt to deceive myself into thinking I don't have to pee and there's no such thing as monsters, only to be sadly and abruptly woken from a much needed night's slumber because you really did have to pee?"

tifu,fdnhgdl,t3_em9c88,1578585889.0,"This had me in stitches! Mainly, because my sister talks to her daughter with the demon voice. Growing up, my sister and I would talk to each other with a demon-ish voice. We would try to out demon each other by creating the creepiest phrases while using said voice. For example, ""I'm gonna penetrate your bones."" I know, we're a bit weird/ morbid....

Fast forward 15 years. She'll use that voice with her daughter just to keep things interesting. You know how fickle a 2 year old can be... My niece uses the same voice to beckon my sister. It's fucking hilarious when we're playing on the playground and she summons the Dark Lord within, bellows out ""mommy!"" She does  it with the most expressionless face ever, it's a majestic sight to see. The other parents' reactions are fucking priceless!!!

Edit: PS, It's all for you Damien!"
