BME tends to be more med device industry and engineering (or Regularly, Quality, Product management, project management) oriented. You just need to direct your efforts to get good work experience in school and you probably won't even need an MS.


Biotech is even less consistent school-to-school than BME. In some cases it's like a Chem-Eng degree oriented at drugs and biologics. That'll get you hella employed and hella paid, as we say in NorCal.

For temp, are you saying it's going over 250 while running or after you shut it off? A real temp gauge will climb sky high after you shut it off because the water in the motor heats up to the temp of the motor. So if it's just that, you're fine.

If it's an old motor, run 10-40 in it.


If it's overheating while running/idle then check coolant level (do 50-50 mix, not 100% coolant), maybe put a new radiator cap on it. Add a shroud to your fan and/look into an electric fan kit (but still add a shroud)."

It's hard to figure out the wiring to get a 110v or 220v generator to plumb directly into the charging circuit of the car, so he's probably done something weird involving an inverter and the alternator and its voltage regulator to end up at 12v that gets plumbed back into the car's 12v circuitry.

* Back-to-back locations and forgetting what hotel room I'm in. I take a picture of it as I come in now.
* Domestic travel blows. Short flights on mediocre planes, shitty airports, shitty travelers, and having to be ""on"" as soon as you hit the ground.
* Shit happens at home and there's nothing I can do about it. ""Sorry to hear that, Honey...well I'm off to a fancy free dinner and drinks!""
* Too easy to go out and drink too much with co-workers. This is that same ""awesome until it's a problem"" category as endless paid for steak dinners, but it takes a toll on your liver, brain, and reputation if you can't strike a balance."
