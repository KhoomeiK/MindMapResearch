SiegeAcademy,ffu0jdt,t3_ev0tlm,1580231859.0,Good post but I think you’re preaching to the choir here. I doubt the types of toxic people you encountered are the types of people to frequent this sub.

ChoosingBeggars,ffphp9g,t1_ffpek6r,1580095313.0,"Yeah and in a more petty sense, fuck that asshole. Good students work hard. People like her trying to undermine that are bullshit."
thisismylifenow,ffotk80,t1_ffon4sp,1580081612.0,Probably with the cameraman helping. Gotta believe in humanity a LITTLE at least.
wholesomememes,ffnffo6,t3_eu8e97,1580065300.0,I always tear up a little bit at this scene because it’s so scary but also because of Gandalf’s words.
wholesomememes,ffmcobz,t1_ffm00eg,1580052444.0,"Queer is a blanket term for people who non-straight and/or non-cisgender, including asexual and non-binary folks."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffm9uie,t3_eu1o4u,1580051058.0,Oof. Watching a grown person throw a tantrum gives me the worst second-hand embarrassment.

SiegeAcademy,ffk1f0a,t1_ffjs21f,1580012862.0,"You know how you train yourself to keep your crosshair at the correct height all the time, until it becomes second nature? Try and do the same but with recoil control. Always in the back of your mind be conscious about keeping a tightly zeroed spray pattern whenever you’re ready to fire.

Basically, stay vigilant and prepared to do what you need to do. Don’t rely solely on instinct to control your recoil. Sorry if that’s super obvious."
Showerthoughts,ffg5kh1,t1_ffg3awl,1579898930.0,"Agreed. Also, the story is a literary work, the names were likely chosen to convey meaning."

SiegeAcademy,ffb0fiv,t3_eskzme,1579748728.0,"This happens. Rarely will you both pop off at the same time, unless you're being matched against braindead opponents. 

I'd say focus less on trying to lead in k/d, and instead try and come up with complementary playstyles and duo strats, and adjust as you go."
SiegeAcademy,ffb052b,t1_ffasplz,1579748533.0,"Yep, also, they fire straight but gravity affects them."
deadbydaylight,ff9gkpa,t1_ff8yec0,1579712560.0,It’s the Spider-Man meme where they’re pointing at each other.

BikiniBottomTwitter,ff13kvf,t1_ff11pja,1579474848.0,"It’s weird right? Even the good ones you can be weird and joke around, but there’s still a big difference between them and real friends."
natureismetal,feq16pt,t1_fepl4zz,1579335927.0,Time is a flat circle.
SiegeAcademy,feljnyq,t1_feld4gk,1579223786.0,"It’s not always the worst thing, it can just be unclear sometimes so I’m trying to break the habit of using that word."
SiegeAcademy,felj9av,t1_feldjdj,1579223505.0,Play lots of mute.
SiegeAcademy,felc1es,t3_epj9m2,1579218649.0,"I think people need to stop saying “main stairs”

“Main” in general is just a lackluster descriptor, and on some maps there can be some debate or confusion about which stairs are the main ones."
natureismetal,fehd5zz,t1_fehc5i7,1579114115.0,Yeah I always think the same thing. But it happens anyway and it’s terrifying.
KerbalSpaceProgram,feg8i0j,t3_eouje0,1579082100.0,Little bit terrifying honestly.
BlackPeopleTwitter,feewbip,t1_feeixm7,1579042609.0,I’m a huge Bernie supporter and I believe  there are many reasonable but quiet ones like me out there. Not all of us are expecting a political revolution overnight. But I would give my left nut to see Citizens United overturned.
SiegeAcademy,fecywjm,t1_fecyhhw,1578990399.0,"That’s good advice from both sides of it, well said. What are your thoughts on trapping the hell out of one side of the map vs having a wider net of traps at the various approaches?"
SiegeAcademy,feagrxq,t1_feaamwn,1578948585.0,I sometimes wait to remove the Gu for the Lesion to peek me. It’s netted me a free kill on a few occasions. Sure you take some free damage but it’s often worth it to get the drop on a defender capitalizing on an “easy” kill.
natureismetal,fe9fssd,t1_fe98jjz,1578937186.0,Being eaten alive isn’t an irrational fear my dude.
wholesomememes,fe6sroh,t1_fe6nrzj,1578903678.0,"I was really fucked from my divorce, like I felt gutted emotionally. For years I never even wanted to contemplate another relationship. I had no interest anymore. I thought that part of me was just broken beyond repair. 

Then I made a friend who was really wholesome and sweet and honest, and it turns out she ended up being into me. And before I even realized, I was smitten. We’re amazing in how much we can heal, and how much the right person can help. Don’t give up."
natureismetal,fe6dm2w,t1_fe6avoq,1578887813.0,"I doubt they considered it when typing their comment. I’m guilty of this myself, and it doesn’t help that these terms of address (Mr., Ms. etc.) are inherently gendered. I’m unlikely to default to “Ms.” for an internet stranger, probably because I’m male. Idk just my 2 cents."
SiegeAcademy,fe60ccu,t1_fe5xpny,1578878947.0,"People who don’t think critically, the same as people who don’t improve. Ironically the same people who need to follow OP’s advice."

SiegeAcademy,fdt9y40,t1_fdswxnm,1578713844.0,"It can be funny when you’re in a stack of people to laugh with and one guy is prone to this shit, but if you’re duo and it’s regular it just gets annoying quick."
trashy,fdt8sky,t3_emrvlb,1578713415.0,"Jfc just leave him. Why does someone have to die? Also, jfc just leave her. How is she worth your life? I will never understand this level of weakness and idiocy."
watchpeoplesurvive,fdstnab,t1_fdsnv0a,1578707791.0,"I mean if you can keep that in mind while that behemoth is looming over you, kudos. I’m not certain I’d stay that cool in that situation. If I stayed put it’s probably because I am too frozen and can’t decide what to do or where to go."
watchpeoplesurvive,fdsso8f,t1_fdsk724,1578707434.0,"I don’t blame them for not helping, what an absolutely terrifying situation. That ship is absolutely titanic.

I can’t imagine how scared the person hanging off the dock must have been, I want to cry and throw up even thinking about it."

BikiniBottomTwitter,fdp8bmx,t1_fdo5quw,1578622361.0,Yeah it’s easy to slap “siblings” on an otherwise unremarkable porn shoot.
SiegeAcademy,fdnym2i,t1_fdnjg8w,1578595493.0,Well with hibana it helps that she has a full auto sidearm you can pull for tight quarters

SiegeAcademy,fdlbxa5,t3_ekusmv,1578520740.0,Aim crouch height if you’re missing your shots. Let the recoil carry your muzzle to the head.
BikiniBottomTwitter,fdg3ibg,t1_fdg32q8,1578378633.0,This ^ and also just plain incorrect.
BikiniBottomTwitter,fdg3fi0,t1_fdftfwv,1578378555.0,Nice.
SiegeAcademy,fdfx53d,t1_fdf5i3m,1578372624.0,"I get that. My issue is just that we see a dozen of these “I’m in a rut” posts every week, and the comments are identical each time. It’s just repetitive."
reallifedoodles,fdfwx70,t1_fdez6ve,1578372444.0,I guess I imagine being in the open wilderness to be less mind shatteringly dull than spending your entire life in an enclosure. That’s all.
reallifedoodles,fdeam2a,t1_fdcnk58,1578334840.0,I can’t imagine it’s enough. They’re quite intelligent so they’re probably going crazy with boredom anyway.
SiegeAcademy,fde9nem,t3_ekuab8,1578334229.0,"Nothing against OP personally, but is anyone else getting really sick of seeing this same thing posted every day?"

lastimages,fcneowf,t1_fcj0jqf,1577810177.0,"I think it would be very difficult for me to look away. When I was young and scared of the dark, I was never a “close my eyes” or “pull the sheet over my head” type of kid. I would just stare transfixed into the darkest corners of my room until it looked like the shadows were moving.

Basically, sometimes our fear response is what it is."
trashy,fcm8r9b,t3_ehtoz2,1577767269.0,All fun and games until you end up with a kid that’s also your grandkid.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fcg2zus,t1_fcfipfu,1577636010.0,"That’s not unnecessarily mean. I want everyone to be happy and comfortable in their skins and feel sexy, but the real world is harsh, and putting yourself in this sort of situation is flirting with disaster. This really could have gone much worse for her."
