doctorwho,fft8jzg,t1_fft2rx0,1580212253.0,Yeah I just saw that article after I posted my thought. I was playing catch up. The episodes for me don’t come out till midnight after it airs for everyone (I bought them on iTunes) so I’m already asleep and then the next morning I’m off to work and can’t watch it there (I’m a teacher). So I can’t watch it till late in the evening.
doctorwho,fft8fmo,t1_fft7bcq,1580212107.0,That’s a fair point. I have seen mostly solo episodes of Classic save for the Five Doctors and the Three Doctors crossovers. So yeah they were a bit cantankerous to each other at times. And given the clues I could see her coming from that era for sure. But Doctor Ruth seemed REALLY cantankerous! But I can go with it if that’s where’s she from. Just wouldn’t be a fave doctor of mine for sure.
doctorwho,ffsr66r,t1_ffsgcge,1580189555.0,"Yeah Ruth was good but Ruth Doctor was very UN-Doctor-like. Even the War Doctor, Tennant at his darkest, and Capaldi (who someone mentioned above as being dark at times), all of them were STILL Doctor-like. Ruth Doctor with the gun and the insulting and the arrogance and putting down OUR Doctor just did not seem to fit what we know of the character. 

I’m going with Ruth Doctor being a multiverse version."

My daughter’s middle school has multiple teachers per subject per grade level. When you take math or ELA, you might get teacher A, B or C. That’s amazing to me because at my school, there is ONE teacher per subject. Whereas her classes have 20 students, give or take, our class sizes are up to 30-40 sometimes."

AskReddit,feyr66j,t1_feypl45,1579449615.0,"Haha yes totally. It took me a long while but I can appreciate 9 now much more. And there’s some great episodes in there as well  but when it comes to rewatching I don’t usually hit up too many of 9’s. 

I will say that I see what they were going for with the first ep, Rose, but to me it just seemed a bit too cheesy. And although I enjoy it now, I know classic Who can be a bit cheesy as well. My memories of classic Who were few and far between. I remember my father sometimes flipped through and had it on PBS back in the day and I recall Tom Baker and K9. Although back then I had no idea who they were; just that it didn’t really appeal to me. So when I tried starting Rose, I think that’s all I could think of, the cheese. 

Now I love all the incarnations of the Doctor. Hartnell is interesting to watch albeit a bit slow on the pacing. And what I’ve seen of Pertwee I enjoyed as well. I don’t even mind the TV movie. The cheese is ok with me now. I just needed the right entry point in order to be able to fully embrace it."

AskReddit,fewtbke,t3_eqsnp0,1579419180.0,"Doctor Who. 

People told me for years to watch it, that it was up my alley. I tried. Again and again. Could not get into Christopher Eccleston at all. I swore it off. 

Then one day I saw someone had posted Capaldi’s war speech in the Zygon episode. The speech was amazing. The companion I saw, Clara, was so attractive and their were two of her there for some reason. It intrigued me. 

I searched to her first appearance and watched Asylum of the Daleks. Matt Smith was impressive! So I watched a few more of his. I was... liking it!

Decided to stop and went back to thee start of Tennant. What the heck I really liked him! Was I actually enjoying the show???

I went back to Eccleston and... yeah nope. Still couldn’t get into it. So, I watched all of Tennant, all of Smith, then all of Capaldi up through season 9, then went back and watched Eccleston to be sure I had seen them all. 

After that, I started buying the seasons so I could watch a long, Capaldi season 10, then the current Jodie seasons as well. Over Christmas I got all of the blue rays for the whole of the reboot save for Eccleston. I’ll get his as soon as I find a good price for it though. I have a large collection of sonic screwdrivers, pop figures, novels, coffee table books, and recently started listening to the Big Finish audios of the 8th Doctor.  Got a hoodie and tshirts galore, a sticker on the back of the car and an air freshener and key ring holder.

The way Battle Lines worked was really unique. Anything like that? I haven’t found anything.

They rushed the whole band creation JUST to get to the point where they could play the hit songs. I still haven’t finished it completely be sure it just moves way too fast and there’s not enough with their characters and relationship building. 

Now The Elton John biopic was masterfully done IMO."
beatles,fd5ma2l,t3_ek3sik,1578179007.0,"There’s one called Nowhere Boy on Netflix. Always meant to watch it but never did. 

There’s also In My Life: The John Lennon Story. On YouTube! https://youtu.be/ja-vNjiAdeU

Back in the 90’s, I think it was, there was a film called Backbeat that covered the Beatles early Hamburg days with Pete Best and Stu Sutcliffe. It ends just after releasing their first single Love Me Do. I liked it even if they did take allowances with the story. Heck most biopics do don’t they? The music was really wild as well. Very hard rocking covers of the Little Richard and other 50’s tunes they would do back then. 

Even before that in 79 there was another one made by Dick Clark Productions. It was ok but definitely a product of its time as the pacing is a bit slower. It’s on YouTube too actually! https://youtu.be/Sq1vAGe6BQQ

I guess there hasn’t been one that definitively covers their whole career which I guess if you really want to do their story justice it would have to be a huge two parter or mini series even just so you can really cover it all without shortchanging anything. 

Oh hang on, there’s also The Linda McCartney story which was another made for TV movie and that covered the Sgt. Pepper era and onward but of course focused more on Paul’s side of things. And then there was a VH1 movie called the Two Of Us that was a fictionalized version of what MAY have happened when Paul and John met in the 70’s to hang out one day."

Each load was like $4-5 and we did like 5 I think. That’s not counting the dryer. So at least $30 overall. Plus for our family of four, we normal do laundry twice a week at least."
