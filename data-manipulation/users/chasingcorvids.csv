feemagers,ffn7tnp,t1_ffm96qc,1580062923.0,"I dunno man, this seems a little too victim-blamey for my taste. While this might have been good advice before she went, there's no changing the past. I feel like this is all-around a fucked-up situation, but you shouldn't pity the kid. He was drunk, and he's a kid and kids do dumb things, but what he did was wrong. OP, I'm sorry this happened to you, although I do agree with the above commenter in that you shouldn't be getting drunk if you're a teenager. Alcohol and teenage kids is never a good mix."
MadeOfStyrofoam,ffkhtos,t3_eu1zru,1580022996.0,"Yep, I feel you there. They've gotten to a point where I don't even care anymore, I just ride them out and continue on with my day. It's gonna be okay, remember that deep breaths are not necessarily as important as slow breaths. Just take breaths as slow as you can and remember that it'll be over soon"

illnessfakersgonewild,ffiyfkw,t1_ffio01w,1579985795.0,"Weird. Whenever I start mine after not being on them for a while, I just feel super spaced out and weird, like my body doesn't belong to me. I can't feel my limbs very well and I'm disconnected from everything like piloting a meat suit. Although I experience some of that on a daily basis anyway, I guess it's just magnified"

fatlogic,ffh6dv6,t1_ffh262z,1579924371.0,"I have a question: would you, personally, be annoyed at the use of ""triggered"" in other mental health contexts? Like if I were to say that seeing blood triggered some self-harming thoughts, or that getting a bad grade is one of my panic attack triggers? I totally get what you mean about people using it incorrectly, cause it always feels irritating and invalidating when I hear people saying it in the wrong context, but I don't know if I'm using it right myself. I've mainly heard it used in the context of PTSD, and I know my problems aren't nearly that bad."
MadeOfStyrofoam,ffgrlv4,t3_eteo7o,1579913280.0,"I fuckin hate DBQ's, good luck man. My AP Euro semester exam was just me bullshitting 2 pages of writing on the Thirty Years War, which I get mixed up with both the Habsburg-Valois war and the War of the Roses. Not confident about that test. DBQ=no bueno"
