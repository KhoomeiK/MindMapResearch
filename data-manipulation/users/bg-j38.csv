specializedtools,fgz7oua,t1_fgyshf1,1581191614.0,"There's a lot of ways. You can swallow it whole or chew it a bit. Some are just too big for me to gulp down without a couple chews. You can add various things on top of them. A common one is [mignonette sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mignonette_sauce) which has a lot of vinegar in it. Some people will use a spicy marinara sauce. Some people add a dollop of horseradish. Others like a few drops of hot sauce like Tobasco. There's not really a wrong way to do it.

But if you add too much garnish you sort of miss the point. There's dozens or hundreds of varieties of oysters and they vary considerably in flavor. It's all based on the content of the water that they're grown in and what species they are. If you want to try a very approachable variety to a newcomer, try Kumamoto oysters. They're on the smaller side and often don't have as much of the briny flavor that others get. Too much garnish really will block out the individual flavor of the oyster and it just turns into a fairly expensive mouthful of gloop flavored like your garnish.

Oysters can be cooked or smoked too. One of the more famous dishes is [Oysters Rockefeller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oysters_Rockefeller) but there's tons of ways of preparing them.

As a side note, Rocky Mountain Oysters, while something some people like, aren't molluscs."

Since it's software defined, you can listen to most frequencies from around 30 MHz up into the GHz range. I think you need different hardware for lower than that.

sanfrancisco,fgjndi0,t1_fgjizcb,1580847598.0,"I think the semi-clever title is misleading. Clipper already works on all the area transit systems except ACE and Capitol Corridor. What's more important is getting some standardization around things like the cost of transfers. When I transfer from BART to Muni, it just says ""Transfer"" on the turnstile and I have no idea how much it actually costs. Factor in youth and senior discounts and it gets complicated. In the article it says there's 18,000 possible fare combinations that the system knows about. That's sort of insane.

Most important is getting the systems to work together. Timetable synchronization is difficult, especially with stuff like buses that are subject to traffic issues. However, when I used to ride Caltrain and BART, it killed me that the actual schedule often had Caltrain arriving at Millbrae with either a minuscule transfer time or two minutes after the BART train left.

If you get caught expect to be arrested at the least and expelled at the worst. We never took ID and had every intention of running like hell if caught. Luckily we never did though there were some close calls.

Most of the entrances are locked. If you find some out of the way ones though (there are some behind buildings near Liz Waters for instance) you might find them unlocked. When I was there I managed to find out the Masterlock number that they used for the whole system and had a key made. No I don't remember what this number was. And no I didn't have any really good connections. I just looked at a lock one day and they had forgotten to scrape the number off.

Prior to that we had just relied on luck. Some aren't locked with Masterlocks but some other mechanism that I know people had tripped with a long screwdriver. The grates are often painted red. You can easily tell what they are in winter because all of the snow around them will be melted.

Make sure you or someone you're with has very good direction sense. It's easy to get turned around once you're down there since the tunnels twist and turn somewhat randomly and it's easy to get disoriented. It's also very dirty. Someone else mentioned asbestos, and you better believe it's down there. Most everything is wrapped with it. It's not like it's floating around in the air, but if you disturb some of the pipe wrappings you might dislodge some. Also, the pipes move steam, so they can be very hot. Even though it's warm down there cover your skin. Wear clothes that can get wet. And you might very well find steam shooting out into a passageway from an open valve. This is as dangerous as it looks. Bring a light source. Mini-maglights are a good idea. There are many places that are lighted, but some tunnels have no lights and others might be burnt out.
The tunnels cover almost all of campus and are nearly all connected to each other. There are a few entrances on Dayton St. near the Southeast Dorms that seem to only be chambers. We got into some of them and they didn't seem to connect. We were however able to walk from the Lakeshore dorms over to Engineering and down to the base of Bascom Hill without any problems to give you a sense of the scale.
The tunnels nearer to Engineering are newer cement construction and interestingly were the only ones we found cockroaches in. The ones towards the older parts of campus are very cramped arched tunnels built with brick. I'm about 5'7 and it was just tall enough for me to walk easily in most places. Pipes often cross the corridor so be prepared to go under them.

There are some interesting sites. There's an American Flag mural that was spraypainted sometime in the 1960s or 1970s that we found. We found the foundation of Bascom Hall jutting into a corridor at one point. We never ran into tunnel Bob. Mostly we just explored and mapped things out.

There are certain places where you can get into sub-basements of buildings. Generally these are dirt floors where maintenance crews stash stuff and smoke cigarettes. We got into a few basements and generally found a table and some chairs with a couple old Playboy magazines.

I always made a point of going down with people I trusted and knew could handle the situation. Some people are exceedingly stupid and loud. Luckily I didn't go on the one trip where people almost got caught. My buddy that I did most of the exploring with took some people down who thought it was a field trip and didn't understand the possible consequences of being caught or the physical dangers. They were loud, smoking cigarettes, having a grand ole time of it. Unfortunately they were a bit too loud near the large maintenance building and there happened to be some people working in the middle of the night. They followed them for a good distance but my friends were eventually able to lose them or they just gave up. So you very well might run into people.

There's also a big trend in individuals getting into the millinery arts. I live in San Francisco and know a few people who do it professionally as a pretty much full time gig. They sell in local high end fashion stores mostly. I also know a couple people who do it as a niche side thing.
