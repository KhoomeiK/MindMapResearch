Definitely not fun when you skip just for kicks but I think they actually just want to make sure you're getting a good education."

fatlogic,fewelo6,t1_feve3ib,1579409302.0,So... Yes but not for that minor of a trigger. I hit that point when I was stalked and harrassed by someone who was mentally unhinged. But I took legal action and went to therapy and took initiative. Like this person should.
AskReddit,fel4ary,t1_fekrn7y,1579213755.0,"I tend to stop short and stand with my feet on the edge of the sidewalk. When the person on the end clocks the disabled woman standing still on the very edge of the sidewalk their friends tend to give them the look of ""you're fucking joking, right??"" To that person and I don't have to say a word. 

Mind you I'm not super visibly disabled, but I have limited use of my right side so I walk with a slight limp and can't lift that arm."
functionalprint,fe9ck33,t1_fe8wtju,1578936397.0,Right?? I'm so jealous. This person is living the life I want to live.
fatlogic,fdvuh4t,t1_fdruyjv,1578751643.0,"So. I just drove through a part of Alabama I'm not used to. And I deadass saw a sign advertising drunk acceptance. It had ""he's a drunk"" quoted with ""words hurt. End stigma."" Underneath it. I'm probably a word or two off but this was real.

I promise I'm not making this up."
nothingeverhappens,fddy1oa,t1_fdcwahn,1578326746.0,"Not OP but I 100% accidentally came out to my dad in a very similar situation (but there was no bet, he just laughed and moved on)"
entitledparents,fcnfl06,t3_ei1twz,1577810701.0,I'm so sorry this happened to you. I have an invisible condition that makes me unable to use most of my left side. I can walk fine but standing up is difficult unless I can use my right arm to push or pull myself up so I prefer stalls with a bar. You can bet I've been screamed at a few times for using the handicapped stall when a mother with a kid was in line 5-6 people behind me.
fatlogic,fcn8xq6,t1_fcmwyza,1577806313.0,"At my lowest weights I had major body image issues. At a BMI of 15 I once cried when I leaned over and my skin folded because it looked like a fat roll. That was my tipping point for doing something about my body image. 

Five years later I've gone through a full self driven kind of recovery because I was so afraid that if I admitted these feelings to a doctor I would be put in one of those ""recovery"" places that force you to eat until you're obese then consider you cured. I'm now sitting at a BMI of 19.5 and what feels like a reasonable fat percentage and working on getting higher through muscle gain. My diet is very clean save when I go out with friends on the occasional weekend night. I've never felt better about my body. 

Now to go work on my other very real mental health demons."
AskReddit,fc7enou,t1_fc654ca,1577505164.0,"Yeah, we have the same laws they just aren't enforced. I live near a public park which should be free of any smoking (there's huge posted signs because it's intended for children) but they're disregarded. I just always carry benedryl everywhere"
AskReddit,fc7d2ua,t1_fc6f59a,1577503885.0,"Full anaphylaxis unfortunately, though what you're describing is how I feel once I start breathing again"
AskReddit,fc5mpzz,t3_ega6uo,1577461647.0,"I'm super allergic to the smoke so I'm not a fan. I support it on a fundamental level but people are wildly inconsiderate about public smoking (in a public park, in daytime, around children). I think we need to draw some clear boundaries on where it's appropriate, as is done with public intoxication and drinking."
fatlogic,fbh3kyr,t1_fbgs7lr,1576864595.0,"I'm allergic to most of the components in cookies. Even my response is to gladly take them, and if pressured to try one on the spot say ""I'm allergic but these are actually my husband's favorite kind!"" (A lie, he doesn't really like cookies)"
