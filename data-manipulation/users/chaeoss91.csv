Small dogs however are allowed to get away with basically everything because they’re tiny - unless they’re being aggressive they’re not gonna accidentally hurt you and people think it’s just so cute when a tiny dog is jumping all over you. So they build up that whole complex and if you finally tell them they’re NOT allowed to do something they fucking explode at you. They’re not used to ever being told no. They’re also taught that their personal space and bodily autonomy means nothing - when you pick them up, cuddle them, move them around etc. they’re helpless. Large dogs can thrash and get free.

I am not saying they were not treated unfairly. But to circle back to my initial point, which so many people are affronted by, they were not slaves. Indentured servitude - often entered into willingly and with a concrete end date - is in no way the same as chattel slavery. Africans were taken from their homes, forced into lifelong slavery as were any children they bore from the moment they were born.
