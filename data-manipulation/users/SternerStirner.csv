There is personal relative meaning that while it is pointless, it's good for you while living to have.  Fond memories, interests, desires, you're free to create your own personal meaning and it cannot be wrong, as nothing is right or wrong.

Being happy and content is neither wrong nor right, but it is good.  To yourself anyway.  You're just new to this.  Eventually you will come to constructive nihilism and the limitation and futility will turn into liberation and freedom."

ContemporaryArt,ffuqb88,t3_evbif8,1580247281.0,"Yes.  Wtf.  Realism much?  Ignoring the art object and focusing on conceptualist has done nothing but create mundane and poorly made art objects.  The art object always needs to be considered.  Of course you can focus on the praxis before the theory.  In a way it turns art into a natural science where the phenomenon guides the theory.  

An expression is also less idealist.  People can have emotions and express them before they understand the cause.

Post modernism is old and stagnant.  While I am a modernist I can acknowledge that post modernism and modernism have become the institutions of old and have a framework similar to the academies and realist structure.  It has created a checklist for what art can be.

Of course you can put the art object first.  Maybe it could be a protest against the current over intellectualization of art."
