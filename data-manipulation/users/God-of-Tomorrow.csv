I say essentially because war in the universe is basically over good and evil has been decided by the victors, the universe is 15 billion years old and while the earth took 4 billion years to get to us the world was ready for advanced life 100s of millions of years ago. So if we got here in 4 billion years how far have beings from the first few billion years gone? Our gods are the ancient aliens truly ancient immortal beings with infinite technical power."
