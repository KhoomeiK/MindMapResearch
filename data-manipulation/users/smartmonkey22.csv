However, you did make a promise, which you broke. I do understand punishing her for the bad science test though, as she needs to excel in all courses, not prioritize one over the other. 

What I would do in this situation, is still reward the good grade, like I promised. Then tell her if she doesn’t get her science grade up on the next one, she will be grounded from it. Then if her science grade doesn’t get better, ground her from the game and tell her to get it back, she must have good grades in all of her classes, not just one or another. Be sure to make it clear what “good” grades are in your household. Some consider all A’s good, some allow A’s and B’s both. 

She held up her end of the bargain, which she should be rewarded for. Then, give her a specific time frame to get her other grade fixed, and all of her grades in a certain range, and if she doesn’t, then ground her from the game."

In the video I linked, it says that Bloodhound is meant to be a representative for the LGBTQ+ community and the female who voices BH said that many trans fans have reached out about how they love BH’s role. 

I am unsure/I don’t think it is specified what the role actually is (out of LGBTQ+) but it is interesting to know that the gender of who voices the character is not necessarily the gender of the character. 

Others also say Bloodhound is referred to as they/them and the character is non-binary.

relationship_advice,ffc9nqq,t1_ffc6rib,1579794701.0,"False. If he has a way to prove there was infidelity, it could very well be used. It depends on the judge and the reasoning for divorce. If he files for divorce, he can put infidelity as his reason. If the wife files, she can put “irreconcilable differences” and get herself a no-fault divorce. 

OP needs to backup the files to a flash drive and be the one to file for divorce— and tell the divorce lawyer he hires that he has the proof of her having the conversations. 

While it may not be deemed that she actual “cheated” since it is only voice, it still gives OP reason to believe there is infidelity, which could or could not help in the process of divorce. Again, it depends on the judge and the situational reason on the divorce papers."

More often than not, they have someone back in their home country, but still find someone in the USA.. This tends to be a “no strings attached” type situation where they have what seems a romantic/sexual relationship with no intentions of furthering it once they leave. 

I understand you are in love with her, and she has said the same about you. This does not necessarily mean that she doesn’t have a boyfriend in her home country. 

Her snapping and talking to him also does not necessarily mean he’s her boyfriend.. Depending on the cultural and social standards of her home country, it may be something else— like a best friend whom she talks about you with. 

Nobody can really answer this as we don’t know what their conversations consist of. However, her hiding the conversations and refusing to talk about the guy make it a bit suspicious.

I think you two need to talk things out. She told him she was in love with you & that she was marrying you & shut him down when he wanted her back. He then overdosed not much later.

relationship_advice,ff3wor1,t3_erifqa,1579550490.0,"In the state of mind that he isn’t in right now, a breakup would not be ideal. Like you said, depression is different for everyone. 

My sister in law and brother were in a similar situation. Our grandpa, who was a very important part in the family, passed away. My brother and I were very close with him and we both went through one of our depressive episodes. They were very, very different though. In mine, I was like you and wanted nothing but to be surrounded by love. My brother, on the other hand, was like your boyfriend and pushed everyone away and shut everyone out — even his wife and sometimes their young children (6 & under) without meaning to. That’s just how he is when he gets that way. 

In the midst of all of the chaos, my brother’s wife backed off a bit and left him alone. This made my brother feel like you do— unloved, unwanted, forgotten. He thought it would be better off without him. He got suicidal, like your boyfriend. 

Keep in mind my brother has a beautiful wife, three beautiful children, a good job, a college degree, a nice house, etc. 

But when you aren’t in the right mind, you can’t step back and realize all that you have. 

My brother unintentionally and without any explanation why had an affair on my sister in law— with her “best friend.” This hurt their relationship a lot— but she stayed by his side because she understood that he’s not completely there when he gets that way. She continued to throw her love on him and stayed determined to fix things, even if it took him a while to come around. 

I know the situations are a little bit different — seeing as my brother and his SO are married with children. 

But my point here is that the same things happened and you have to make a decision. 

If you want to be more patient and more understanding with your boyfriend like he was with you— then be it. Nobody else can make you be it. You have to do it yourself. You are in your right mind and you are fully capable of being anything you want to be. If you want to be there for him, do it. If you want to love him forever, do it. 

In the midst of the chaos, you need to be his calm. You need to be his foundation, the thing that doesn’t change, doesn’t envy, doesn’t fade away. 

He feels like everything in his life is crashing down right now— so you need to make sure that you can be at least one thing that isn’t. Be the little speck of hope in his doubts. 

I personally think that leaving him, especially since he is the love of your life, will make a bad situation worse— for the both of you. 

Love is hard, it’s messy, it’s painful sometimes, but it is so so worth it. It may be dark and gloomy and feel hopeless right now but it isn’t always like that. 

Find ways to connect with him that will help suit his depressive episode. For instance, you said he doesn’t like to get out of bed when he gets that bad— instead of planning a dinner date at a restaurant, plan to stay in bed in your pajamas all day and watch tv, order take-out, do something that doesn’t take a lot of effort. Run him a hot bath if he likes to take baths, put a towel in the dryer for a bit and just before he gets out, give him a fresh warm towel to wrap himself in. 

There are little ways and things you can do to show him that you’re still the foundation, that you are still in love with him, despite the chaos. 

In my honest opinion, now would be the worst time possible to leave him. He already doubts himself and thinks you’re better without him. Show him why you aren’t, show him why you love him, why you need him, why you’re with him. 

I know it’s so very hard right now, but if you truly love this boy, do not let something he can’t control be the reason you leave. 

Love him, and love him fiercely."

I think it’s that once someone starts to get comfortable, especially living together, things become more “casual” but I don’t mean that in a bad way. 

He may not ask you on dates because he loves just being at home chilling with you. 

My boyfriend and I don’t really go out anymore but we will stay home, pop some popcorn, and watch tv or play Xbox together. 

We do dress up and go out sometimes but it’s not an all the time thing. We both really like to stay at home with each other and just be alone together.

relationship_advice,fepsc8k,t3_eqcyg6,1579329606.0,"You said you were sixteen, which is a very vulnerable age for many reasons. Hormones, life, etc, there is always something going on. 

I am not one that likes to make assumptions about someone’s sexuality, but I will say this: the way that you bbf “obsesses” (as you said) over being close with this guy, makes it seem as if he desires something deeper than friendship. 

Has your bbf been this way about another girl? For instance, has he ever “obsessed” (as you said) over being ‘friends’ with another girl, as he has this guy (and even your friend who moved away)?

If he isn’t really territorial (or “obsessed”) of other girls or other friends, just one specific guy, maybe he hasn’t completely discovered his sexuality or come to terms with it, or even “come out” with it. 

This may not be the case, but typically (especially high schoolers) y’all about someone more frequently when they feel attracted to them. 

Another question is, does your bbf have more guy friends, or more girl friends? This doesn’t mean whether he is homosexual or not, but often times you can tell by the group of friends whether it is a possibility or not. (Again, I don’t like to make assumptions, I’m just going off of HS experiences/stories I’ve heard.) 

I would express to BBF that you are missing the feeling of closeness you had, and explain that you aren’t sure why it feels like it has drifted off. BBF could be pulling away from you or making (what seems like) stabs at you about “he’s funnier” or “he would get the joke!” to see what you would say about what bbf should do. 

I would encourage BBF to be friends with guy and I would also ensure BBF that he can always trust you & that you will never judge or mistreat him for anything. 

BBF may be looking for signs that you care by you showing jealousy or other small acts as such. 

I don’t think you’re “losing” bbf as per say, but it seems that BBF is drifting away for other reasons. 

I would talk to him and ask him if everything is okay between you, etc, and any concerns that you have. Being open about how you feel in a relationship (yes, I mean friendship) is the best key, whether platonic or intimate."

I could understand them thinking your parents are “shit” for not coming to get you when you were (presumedly) unconscious. They were worried about you, which is understandable. 

Your friends, because they allowed people you didn’t know to surround you and poke and pick at you, then also didn’t tell the parents at the party what was going on with you.

And if they do, they’ll get a harsh response from me such as “my mom is dead jackass.” or something like that. Sometimes harsher if it really puts me in a mood.

Another thing that really annoys me is suicide jokes, or someone saying “I’m going to mill myself” because my brother committed suicide when I was 13. To others, it’s a harmless joke, but to me it really means something. 

The same goes for “we’re about to get raped” or “Let’s rape them.” (Which I hear a LOT when playing online video games.) That is a joke to some people but it’s a very serious matter for some others.

in my opinion, it’s your girlfriend. if you were to be snapchatting 12 other girls + your exes, I’m sure she would be pretty upset too. the fact that she ignores how you feel about it and tells you to stop being insecure is NOT a healthy relationship. it’s okay to have friends/acquaintances of the opposite sex who you see once in a great while and say “hi” to at grocery stores, but typically not if you privately chat them every single day to the point where it makes your partner uncomfortable, which is what she is doing. 

when my boyfriend and I first started dating we both had snapchat. but due to the amount of girls who kept trying to get ahold of him & guys who kept trying to get ahold of me, even after turning them down, we both agreed we didn’t want to have snapchat anymore as we really have no reason to have disappearing chats or messages. 

I have a few friends who cut snapchat out of their social media networking because of their intimate relationships as well. 

It’s really a matter of preference, and if it bothers you, it bothers you. You shouldn’t have to explain yourself. You saying that it bothers you should be reason enough for your girlfriend to stop doing it. 

I would have a long talk with her about it and tell her that if the behavior continues, you need to discuss where your relationship will go from there. She is already displaying major red flags by getting defensive when you ask about it and then turning it around on you by asking, “why does it bother you?” Because duh. Almost anyone would be bothered by something like that."

You would both get a fresh start in a new city + you’d be making a lot more money than you are now & the only thing you’d have to give up is where you live. 

If she moves in with you at the originally planned time & just leaves most of her things packed, she will get to live in Vegas for a little while, you will get to be together, and the distance won’t have to last longer than planned. 

In my opinion, I think she should go ahead and move to you as Vegas and Seattle are much closer than Fort Lauderdale and Seattle. She could make the big move to Vegas, stay there for a month or two with you, and then together you can start over in your new place + new city without having to be apart for longer."

If people got banned for leaving Play Apex early, they’d lose interest in the game. Some people quit because they have something come up they need to deal with that minute, someone else picked their main character, and sometimes two friends have another friend want to join their squad right after they started their game, so naturally they leave the rando to play with their friend.

When it comes to laundry, I do everything as far as washing/drying/ironing, but he helps fold and put away. He usually puts away the towels and stuff and I put away his clothes (mostly because I am a freak about keeping clothing organized.)

I help out financially with my refund that I get back every semester, which is usually a pretty penny, but I don’t work during the semester. So in other words, he takes care of mostly everything financially.
