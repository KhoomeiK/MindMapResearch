> Hi,
> 
> I see that you have been posting incorrect information about broncolor and their relationship with Godox, as is evidenced above – both here and on other forums.
> 
> As an authorized broncolor distributor, I would like to correct your misinformation, as much as I can.
> 
> RFS2.2 and X1 appear very similar, but are in fact very different internally. The biggest difference is that they are NOT cross compatible – RFS2.2 will not trigger X1 and vice versa. This is in part due to the 99 channels/studio addresses. RFS2.2 is backwards compatible with RFS2.1 and RFS2. Godox transmitters are not compatible in any way with RFS from broncolor. This is Swiss technology and will remain that way. As a side note, RFS2.1 was available as receiver (for use with older bron packs) or transceiver. They did not get that from Godox.
> 
> broncolor wanted to enable HS on their strobes but not in the haphazard way that other companies did with triggers that weren’t reliable and wanted to support Canon, Nikon and Sony camera systems from the start without timely delays. Godox triggering was deemed to be reliable enough for broncolor’s purposes and broncolor licensed Godox for some components and technology for RFS2.2 to enable HS timing. Ultimately, broncolor was able to release solid triggers that worked.
> 
> broncolor has always used IGBT circuitry in Move, Siros and Scoro, along with other proprietary technology, to manipulate the flash curve to offer the most reliable colour, power and temperature output, among other things. HS is indeed an optimized flash curve (not pulsed), that can be further manipulated from the trigger using manual adjustments.
> 
> John – to your point about the studio channels/ID – broncolor has used that terminology since the original RFS. It isn’t automatically set – you set the studio address on your strobes, and then a lamp address (unique for each light or lamp output) and then set the RFS 2.2 (Press ST, scroll to the studio number of your lights and press ST to lock it in).
> 
> I’d also like to squash some other speculation that Elvis has posted on other sites, such as photography-on-the-net: all broncolor strobes, lamps and packs are made in Switzerland. While some components may come from China, many components are sourced from Europe and all design, manufacturing, assembly and testing is done at the company in Allschwil.

> broncolor recently released a great blog post with pictures from inside the factory: http://news.broncolor.swiss/about-products/__trashed-2/

Several credible media outlets have criticized Press TV such as the Guardian who described Press TV as “the controversial 24-hour news channel funded by the Iranian government.” British journalist Nick Cohen has called the station “a platform for the full fascist conspiracy theory of supernatural Jewish power.” The right leaning Washington Examiner has described them this way “If you like crackpot conspiracy theories or you’re interested in what the Iranian government wants you to believe, then pay a visit to Press TV!”

Yet the official narrative still implicates 19 fictional hijackers of which 15 were said to be Saudi nationals.” In general, if it involves the USA or Israel you can bank on it being negative and most likely misleading and/or false.

>	Camera color filters are usually over-sensitive in some ranges compared to the eye, to have better low light properties or work better in certain types of light. This means that to for example make a correct deep blue color in the normal range we actually may need to subtract one color channel. If the camera then registers an ultra-saturated color the matrix may actually end up with a negative result (clipped to black). For a reproduction profile where we know what we will shoot this is generally not a problem as we won’t face that type of colors or strange artificial lights that can trigger the situation. To make a general-purpose profile maximally robust it’s better to make the matrix match less well and limit the negative factors.

He conceded that the relationship might make for “an unusual and interesting story,” but said, “If there’s something beneath the surface, that’s not part of our relationship and I’m not directly aware. They’re interested here in something that can get easy access to biomarkers.”

The CIA fund approached his company, telling him the fund shares an interest in looking at DNA extraction using the method pioneered by Skincential Sciences, according to Lebovitz.

> The CIA fund has described human skin as a “unique, underutilized source for sample collection.”
> Beyond that, Lebovitz said he was unsure of the intent of the CIA’s use of the technology, but the fund was “specifically interested in the diagnostics, detecting DNA from normal skin.” He added, “There’s no better identifier than DNA, and we know we can pull out DNA.”

Now, here is something I want to get off my chest: I can't believe people think that I would confess to them being part of a criminal conspiracy, especially on line. Also, I beg anyone who thinks they have any real evidence of foul play to go to the police. Finally, one of the reasons I am convinced Kurt killed himself is that he purchased a .20 shotgun. Kurt was not interested in hunting birds or squirrels, he bought that firearm as a suicide device. Suicide is not rational.
