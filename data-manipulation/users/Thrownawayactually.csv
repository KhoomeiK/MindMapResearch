When my mom bought her a gas stove and had it put in the house along with a gas line, she jumped at the tick before the flame lit. She didn't get a landline until like 2001 and was convinced that the phone had to rest.  My uncles got rid of the furnace in her home when she got gas lines but she still had a giant pot of water simmering at all times until she died. She chopped wood for her fireplace until the month before she died, walked 2 miles to the grocery store every other day, told us stories about her grandmother who had remembered being a child slave. Seeing black people on television and white people shop in the same stores tickled her to no end. She was born in 1919 and things were segregated in her life for lomger than they were desegregated and she was very proud of the youth for gettng that done."
