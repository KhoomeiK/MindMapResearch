Two: I believe, although I'm willing to be corrected, that areas with limestone are generally good for agriculture. Caves occur in areas with limestone. So there would naturally be an overlap between areas with caves and areas good for agriculture, which would correlate with areas of higher population, which would correlate with more missing persons cases.

DebunkThis,feza0b0,t3_eqz102,1579455192.0,"A couple of things. First, your grandmother had to have answered some questions before she was allowed on the air, whether you remember them or not. TV shows don't just allow anybody on the air without pre-screening their questions and asking enough questions to be pretty sure the caller isn't a complete nut or has some kind of agenda. These questions probably narrowed down your grandmother's age range and a few other things; for example, if she said her grandson suggested that she call, the screener immediately knew that your grandmother had at least one child (your parent) and had a 50/50 chance of guessing whether that child was male or female. 

Second, ""your child is sick"" is an incredibly broad category. If her daughter had a cold, the flu, mental illness, cancer, a disorder, etc., any of these could fit. Once again, if your grandmother said something like ""my grandson suggested I call"", the screener could guess that grandma might be taking care of grandson because the parent couldn't.  

Third, what if the tarot card reader was wrong? They get these things wrong all the time; they just hand-wave it away by claiming that you just don't know yet what they're predicting. She happened to be right, because of extremely broad phrasing and a good guess, but if she'd been wrong, she would've just told you that the person who was sick was 'like a daughter to you' or that 'she is sick, you just don't know it yet' or some such.

Can confirm, not Yosemite, although it almost looks like parts of certain formations might have been shoehorned in there. The valley floor is flat and has no agriculture/fenced sections. It does have oaks, but only in certain areas, and they don't change to all those colors. Kind of a creepy, disjointed composite."
