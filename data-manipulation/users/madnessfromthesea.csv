I have dated various types of men and any guy can get a girl if he has a personality. If you're talking insta-fuck, then perhaps looks play more of a part, but if you're looking for a real partner, personality does.

I think there has to be a lot more wrong with a person than just looks like you are implying.  There's a lot of people with the personality of a slug who won't get dates no matter how good they look. But if it's what you consider an ugly person with an ugly personality who isn't getting dates, well it's not the other person's job to fix that person's personality or self."
