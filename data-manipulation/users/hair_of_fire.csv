relationships,fddaia7,t1_fdd42zf,1578302587.0,"Sorry, don't take it personally, she's like that with a lot of people. She just likes being negative and putting people down. She has poor social skills and can't talk to people in a non-confrontational way."

AskMenAdvice,fcwnogk,t3_ej8a6f,1578030876.0,"My boyfriend doesn't mind at all. I had a guy who was way too possessive so out of habit I would double check. He really trusts me and I would never do anything to hurt him. I'm friend with one of my ex's, (we dated for hardly any time and it was 4 years ago). He's totally comfortable with it cause my ex is in a really good relationship and he's the only one I've stayed friends with because we have a lot in common."
SAHP,fctrjn7,t1_fctqmyj,1577955792.0,"You know? You should do motivational speeches, you're really good at them! I mean you can keep saying that stuff and it doesn't make it any more true. I'm most definitely not a liar, I also don't make up stuff about other people. 
Also, thang delusional? What? 
I'm definitely not delusional, if I was making stuff up about other people while being extremely hypocritical, yeah maybe."
SAHP,fctq78w,t1_fctpfh8,1577953865.0,"I still love this, putting words in my mouth and everything. Everything you're lecturing me on is on stuff that you're doing too. I'm just defending myself from lies you keep saying that's all. You know I guess saying I'm a decent person and achieving goals is bragging and SO awful. You're right I shouldn't be proud of the stuff I've done. Shame on me. I guess you are the only person that can, ""brag."""
SAHP,fcto5t4,t1_fctndxv,1577951080.0,"It's actually pretty easy, I'm not worried. I'm a decent human being so I'm already on a head start of not being you. Also, there's a lot I've done and I'm still doing really good."
