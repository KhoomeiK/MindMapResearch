dogs,ffp6hcz,t3_eug4dy,1580087449.0,"Nope, nope and more nope. If you haven't had a dog as an adult before, especially an adult with toddlers, I really think you guys should wait. 

There's also no way to know what this really sweet dog is like with kids. When you decide to get a dog, if you are looking for an adult, you want one that was fostered with kids, and that you can give back, if it turns out that the dog really isn't great with kids. 

Also, not all dogs are good dogs in an office. Or outside. Or with other people. Or with other dogs. And I'm not hearing that you have any fence up? Or maybe you do. 

> Anyone had experience and advice about the biting, jumping, pulling that is bound to happen from both sides?

I can promise you that it will happen, and it can be really bad and scary. Again, you want a dog who was fostered in a home with kids. You don't want your kids to be the test subject for, ""well maybe this will be ok""."

If you live near a vet school or a large training facility that is not part of a big box store, i'd ask if they have any people doing pet sitting. 

I have friends who, when they were in vet school, would do house sitting stints around the area. They'd be in someone's house for a week or so, and take care of the pets and the mail and whatever. 

I use a local group that includes some people like that, as well as general dog people. I can request specific sitters, all of whom have been to my house once before I have them working here, just so they can meet my dogs and see the house and yard. 

I'm sure Rover has some great people, but I pay $100 a night for someone to stay here, and from what I can tell, that's not much more than a Rover person in my area. I'd rather have someone that I know stay in my house..."

If you want the verbals to count for more, I'd go back to basics and use a clicker if she understands that. I'd reward for her responding to the voice commands."
dogs,ffmbna1,t1_ffk3d7q,1580051960.0,"> Funnily enough, growing up I always associated crates for dogs as being sort of lazy when it comes to training them. Essentially just shutting them away so that you don't have to actually get them to not do certain things. The foster family let me know that he actually really enjoys going into his crate, so it's going to be a first for me.

My dogs love their crates. They eat in them when they're babies, and they learn that when they're in a crate, no one will bother them. It's their space. My baby dog is currently in a crate, with the door wide open, snoring away after spending time chasing my other dogs around our now snow free but holy shit muddy yard. 

I'd use a crate with this guy and make a serious point of taking him out early and often."

Also, while you're saying this dog out of nowhere attacked your dog, since we weren't there, we don't know what signals **your** dog was giving off. Some dogs STARE at other dogs, some dogs just give off an aura of ""I will fuck you up"", etc. Yes sometimes attacks come out of nowhere, but often there is some indication from the other dog that it could be on. 

I don't know if you are currently enrolled in any training classes, but I would have him in a class where he can learn to be around other dogs, in a controlled environment and learn ways to deal with the stress of being near other dogs."

I don't know if you're using a crate, but a dog like this in a crate can still seriously injure himself, breaking teeth in an effort to get out. 

The group really needed a house where people work from home or are retired. 

If you can handle the $500 a month, and understand that this dog may never be ok being left alone, and you don't have neighbors, then keep him. But I think you're setting yourself up for a long and expensive dog experience, and I think there are homes where this dog would be ok."

So unless some magic has happened and she no longer does that, I'd assume it's on her possible menu of shit she does. 

When you are over there, I'd ask that they muzzle her. And if they won't, I wouldn't go over. She sounds like she may or may not bite, but given her size, I'd go with, ""could happen"", and have them muzzle her. Dogs who bite humans don't magically get better, and you have no idea what her triggers are, and how you might accidentally cause them to flare."
dogs,ffma5qe,t3_eu6i37,1580051286.0,"> I'd say he gets his poo in the puppy toilet more than 95% of the time. 

Are you using puppy pads? They tend to leave a scent so even if you pick them up and figure it's ok, it really isn't

Also at 2 months puppies have very little bladder control. They think I have to pee and within a second they're doing it. 

I take puppies outside on a leash, after they eat, after they play, after they wake up and any time it's been 2 hours. They're on a leash, they pee, I praise them. 

> a private area that includes his bed, food, and toilet - nicer than a crate)

And that's way more room that odds are this puppy needs. He's going to pee all over it. 

I don't know why you don't want to use a crate, but using a crate makes house breaking far easier. And, when the puppy is being a beast, it means he's confined area where he can take a nap, and not be bothered, and not bother you. Crates don't have to be tiny. My puppy has slept in a huge crate since she was a baby, but since she is crate trained she knew not to pee in it. 

>right now I take him out multiple times a day so he can run around like crazy and expend a lot of energy. 

Is this outside but in your apartment, or actually outside? 

I use actual bones for my dogs, heavy ones. You can put a little, a tiny bit of peanut butter on it to encourage him. 

Puppies can be ok at two months, and turn into raging hormone machines at six months, so take nothing for granted, and keep on telling him to take treats easy, and to sit or down or not bite or not jump, over and over again. It also sounds like he came home before he was 8 weeks, so he's very, very young. I'd expect some changes over time as he gets more used to living with you and some of those changes will probably include pushing boundaries to see what happens. :)"

Goldens shed profusely all year and their fur is long and creates dust bunnies. My dog that does therapy dog visits is brushed before we leave the house, and after he gets out of the car, and he still sheds. 

Labradors also shed profusely but their hair is shorter and often not as overwhelming to the casual observer.

dogs,ffihusr,t3_ettsft,1579974233.0,"All of the web sites like that are fronts for puppy  mills and other volume breeders. 

Most breed clubs have something in their code of ethics that prohibits sales via a third party. No good breeder would trust a third party, like Premier Pups or Lancaster or whatever, to find a good home for puppies. And no good breeder needs them to find homes. They usually have a waiting list. 

If you can, have your parents figure out what sort of dog they want, and start doing research on finding a good breeder and not some puppy mill front. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/wiki/identifying_a_responsible_breeder) might help them."

Which is where my puppies sleep. There's a crate next to the bed. I can hear them if they need to go out. 

I have three crates on the first floor of the house: one next to my computer, one next to the dining room table and one in the living room which is used by visiting dogs. I don't let my puppies have any freedom when the humans are eating dinner. I don't want to referee anything so puppy is in a crate, right next to me, chewing on a bone. 

Puppies need a lot of sleep, like 20 hours or so a day. My puppies often sleep in a crate, as when they're sleeping why not?

I think owning 3 puppies at once is crazy but that's their decision. The actual use of crates is not abusive if used wisely."

So you have an adult dog who also is not housebroken, and yeah the puppy will pee as well. You would have to seriously clean and disinfect the house, and get the older dog to not mark, before you can expect a puppy to not mark up the house. 

The other stuff is, he's not housebroken. I assume my puppies have to pee even when they don't tell me. So when they just ate, when they were running around the house, when they wake up, when it's been two hours, I take them out, on a leash, and praise them when they pee. 

And a dog who is marking up the house in front of you needs to sleep in a crate."

actually, I hate to say it but you're feeding her too much. 

It's the same as with humans: if you need too many calories, you gain weight. It's really that simple. 

She doesn't want to walk because odds are it's hurting her to do so. A typical Golden bitch should weigh about 50-55 pounds. If she's 20 pounds over? That's a lot. 

>After these frustrating walks I’ll make her go to her cage and scold her and my parents will do the same. She’ll apologize (come crawling out to our feet) 

Please don't do that. That's like if you took a 250 pound woman to the gym, and put her on a treadmill and told her she **HAD** to run 5 miles. And when she fell over, you put her back on the treadmill. And really, she needs to lose weight and then get on the treadmill and not run at first. 

Two cups a day for a Golden bitch who is obese, is still too much. And if you aren't actually using a cup measure, shrug. Who knows how much she's getting. 

I'd go read the bag and see what they say for a sedentary 50 pound dog. And if they say three cups cut that down and again measure the food that she's eating.

But if a shelter knows that a dog is actually dog aggressive, or will kill cats or can't be around the chaos that is a household with kids, why sugar coat it? Be upfront: this dog needs a single dog household. I've seen some where someone has written that the dog in question may be ok with a laid back dog. How would someone know that? And, what if someone says ok, this should work, and they bring the dog home. 

There have been people who have posted in this sub, who have brought dogs home that were supposedly cat safe, and within hours the dog tried to kill the household cat. That should never, ever happen.

dogs,ffhw1mc,t1_ffhsuqy,1579956488.0,"> My point being that puppies should be kept on the owner's private property and away from where other dogs go potty until fully vaccinated.

Puppies leave the breeder before they're fully vaccinated. That's why people who purchase a puppy shouldn't go to a dog park or other area where they can't verify the vaccination status of the dogs. 

training buildings that host puppy classes should ask for the vaccination status of the dogs that train there, and should have some protocol for cleaning the floors. 


Finally, puppies who have been vaccinated can still get parvo. Just as other vaccines are not fully effective, parvo is as well. It's rare, but a properly vaccinated puppy can still get it, despite following the correct protocol for vaccination. Maternal antibodies can prevent the vaccine from being fully effective, resulting in puppies with parvo, even after they were vaccinated."

How often are you feeding her? You can feed her two cups a day, but you can split it into three or four feedings. When my puppy was younger, she had second dinner.

I think you don't really have enough time for a puppy right now. There are times when they need to go out every 90 minutes. And in the first few weeks odds are they won't sleep thru the night.

dogs,fffbeig,t1_fff90oq,1579880244.0,"> Do you think it will get better with age?

Usually it does. Puppies have an insane amount of stupid frenetic energy with not enough outlets. 

I take my puppies to classes and just on errands in an attempt to give them something else to do, and to make them tired. 

We had nose work class last night, and after half an hour of zooming around the yard when she got home, she basically fell over and slept for 10 hours."
dogs,fff9ky2,t3_et8uk8,1579879072.0,"I'm a big fan of, when the play is slipping into stupidness, to break it up and let the puppy take a nap in a crate. It's not punishment, my puppies get some great bones in in the crate, and it allows everyone to calm the fuck down, almost instantly. 

When the play goes over the top, a few things happen: the adult dog feels that he can't properly tell the puppy to stop, when it **is** a puppy and the dog doesn't want to treat the puppy as an adult and, the puppy is learning that he can do whatever the hell he wants, with no consequences. 

Dogs do play rough. They play with their teeth and they pounce and bounce. But when it escalates and it can do that in a second, it's important to stop it. 

Often times the over the top play is caused by a puppy who's been going going going all day and is like a toddler who needs to not be in Walmart but at home, in a quiet room, where she can take a fucking nap. They erupt into screaming or flailing or biting or whatever and no one wants to be near them. 

Once the puppy loses his license at about 7 or 8 months, the adult dog may well say, ya know, I took your shit for months and now you will pay. 

I am ok with a little bit of that: I am not ok with any adult dog seriously correcting a puppy, to the point of injuring the dog, and I'm really not ok with random dogs ""telling off the puppy"" or ""putting the puppy in his place"" or  ""teaching the puppy a lesson"" or whatever it is that people think happens. 

My job is to keep puppies safe so they don't get injured or mentally damaged. I don't need a random dog to try to kill my puppy for the crime of being a twit. I want my puppies to feel safe with me, and to understand that I will take care of them. That's erased by people allowing any dog to correct a puppy for the crime of being a puppy. 

Anyway if both dogs are ok with the play style then odds are it's fine. When the older dog has had enough, the puppy needs to be crated. Odds are he'll fall asleep in a few minutes. When he wakes up he'll be fine for round two."
dogs,fff6y7w,t1_fff28iu,1579877276.0,"> Definitely something for people wanting to start out in conformation in the breed to keep in mind :)

Yup!!! Which is why when someone has never owned a dog, or has never done conformation, goes to a breeder and says, I want to do it, they're going to ask some hard questions. 

Aside from the money, it's a time investment. If you like dog sports, and it's the big season for say agility or dock diving or whatever, AND the local kennel club is putting on a show and rumor is there will be majors, you have to decide what's important. And with a Golden you can't say, well I can dock dive at that show because they have a mobile dock, if you won't be in the ring till 3PM. The handler isn't going to want to get a soaking wet dog to then groom for the breed ring. 

I have friends in breeds that aren't as hair intensive or as numerically popular and they show their dogs and finish them on their own. Their issue is finding majors and again, it's about what do you want to do with the dog. If there are only a few a year in your area in your breed, you want to be there for them. 

In my area, Lab bitches need 94 of them to make a five point major. If  you had a Curly Coat, you'd only need six. The difference in showing is pretty vast and helps explain why some breeds have a preponderance of pro handlers while others do not."
FundieSnark,ffezufc,t3_et4okk,1579871683.0,"I used to live across the street from an older woman who was very religious. She would go to mass three times a week, sent all her kids to Catholic school, had a brother who was a priest, etc. She was a terrific person, and we would sit on her porch and talk about dogs and family and books for hours. I still miss her.  

Anyway, one of her daughters (married of course you heathens!!), was pregnant. And they found out that the fetus had a trisomy disorder, the one that causes Down Syndrome. 

And my neighbor talked to her daughter, told her the marriage wouldn't survive having a disabled child, and went with her to Planned Parenthood, where daughter had an abortion.  

My neighbor never regretted it. She spent a great deal of time thinking it all thru and felt that it didn't conflict with her core beliefs on God and religion. I couldn't argue that since it's not my religion, but I have always come back to this: that when she was faced with that sort of decision she went with what **she** felt was right for her daughter and talked it thru with her in such a way that her daughter agreed and went to PP. 

The daughter went on to have three more kids and the marriage was sound. 

Anyway, there's another datapoint for relief at having safe and legal abortions. 

I also have a friend who's partner years and years ago, before Roe V Wade, got pregnant. She went to Mexico for an abortion and was fine, there were no complications. But 60 years later, she was still angry that something that should be basic health care, was so difficult to get. She was lucky that she had the money and the time to be able to have it done, but she was very angry and that never left."

I praise and let them play and leave it at that. No food and I'm a big time cookie pusher. 

I also crate puppies (and this is a puppy) any time I can't keep full attention on the dog. That means if I'm baking or showering the puppy is in a crate. By six months I can trust them to not burn down the house if I take my eyes off of them but at four months? No."

Muzzle train him ASAP. A 90 pound dog can easily get away from you and attack another dog. And while your dog may not be human aggressive anyone breaking up the fight can get bitten, badly. 

Did the rescue group tell you that he's that reactive? And, how long have you had him?

Odds are this dog will always require exacting management, and will not wake up one day and ignore other dogs, especially if you can't afford to work with a trainer. Aggression issues are a thing that really needs a person to watch the dog and human interacting and see what the trigger is for the dog to launch. If you can not afford a trainer and you have not had this dog for long, you may want to consider returning the dog. 

But if you do keep this dog, always have him muzzled when you are out in public. No exceptions. 90 pounds of opinionated teeth who is lunging at other dogs, is a hair away from getting into some serious trouble."
bestoflegaladvice,ffew2cu,t1_ffe80gl,1579867948.0,"I don't know what LAOP is intending with the post. I'm not sure if what is described in the post is what actually happened. And I wonder what happened to the room mate and why LAOP isn't worried about who's going to help pay the rent and utility bills. Anyway. 

First was this:

> Three months ago I adopted a pure bred Golden Retriever female puppy. I went to a respected adoption agency who sourced the puppy 

That's not how people **purchase** well bred and expensive dogs. It sounds like LAOP found some web site such as this [one](https://www.greenfieldpuppies.com) and bought a puppy that actually came from a [puppy mill](https://www.thepuppymillproject.org/amish-puppy-mills/). And hey it happens, but OP doesn't have a puppy [worth a truckload of money](https://www.greenfieldpuppies.com/golden-retriever-puppies-for-sale/). 

There are breeders who do follow a code of ethics from the [parent club](https://www.grca.org), which you can see in part [here](https://i.imgur.com/vh6cvmB.png). So again, I'm sure LAOP loved his/her dog regardless but I'm also pretty sure that dog came from some web site that is a front for puppy mills, and not a super expensive puppy. If LAOP is talking damages, there's a difference between a puppy that was $500 and one that was $3,000 or more. 

Next we have this:

>Four days into my trip I get a message from my friend group chat with a screencap of a local animal shelters ad for a dog that looked exactly like mine

I've had Golden Retrievers for decades. And I adore them, but when you have a [big group of them](https://twitter.com/RPFriesians/status/1021068769156685824?s=20) either really really know your dog, or put some [funky](https://i.imgur.com/oFfPKp1.png) collar on him. 

I don't believe that a small picture on a random local shelter group was identified by LAOP's friends as being the dog that LAOP owned. I've had people confuse my dogs, who really don't look that much [alike](https://i.imgur.com/g0Ctgjh.jpg). And that's in person, when they're looking at the actual dogs, vs a photograph. 

Years ago I boarded my first Golden at a boarding kennel. When I came to pick her up, two weeks later, out came a Golden, with my dog's collar and leash. And it was not my dog. The kennel help had mixed her up with someone else's dog. My dog had a small freckle in one ear, and aside from telling the kennel staff, ""WTAF??"" I was able to say, ""go get the Golden bitch who has an ear freckle!!"" I've always wondered if the other family had shown up first, if they would have gone home with my dog. And the answer is, I suspect they would have. 

LAOP said:

>I pull up the adoption records with my name on it, the microchip with my name on it and all the photos I have on my phone.

Well here's a picture of [my latest puppy](https://i.imgur.com/w617oqI.jpg). And most people who own Golden puppies or who owned a Golden puppy would happily tell me that their puppy looked just like my puppy. 


Anyway...

LAOP is in Washington State. [Washington has no laws about the length of holds on dogs in a shelter](https://www.animallaw.info/content/state-holding-period-laws-impounded-companion-animals). So a shelter may have a policy, but there's no actual law guiding it in Washington. If a puppy comes in on a Friday and there's some big adoption event scheduled on Saturday,  in theory, that puppy could be adopted out and gone before the shelter closes on Saturday. So the shelter in question could have had a 72 hour policy but that's not a law that they **have** to follow. 

And the puppy was spayed...Well that does happen at shelters, since they don't want more dogs coming in, but I'm trying to do the  math for how long they had the puppy before she was spayed and how long after that they adopted (actual adoption not purchase from a puppy mill web site), her out. I don't think most shelters would adopt out a very recently spayed puppy, because while it is routine surgery it's also abdominal surgery. The last thing anyone would want is for a puppy to start zooming around, all puppy-like in her new home, and wind up messing up sutures or getting the incision site dirty. 

And on to the police involvement. Twice. For something that doesn't sound like it would warrant it, as it's a he said she said thing with property. 

LAOP states that they started calling lawyers. I'm not sure what sort of lawyer would be called or how LAOP would sum up what happened? How would someone even know who to call? 

Finally I have no idea what happened, but I don't think the story being told here is exactly what did happen. I have heard verifiable stories of people going out of town and sticking friends or family with a pet to care for, and being gone for far longer than expected and/or not telling the baby sitter, that they were left in charge of a dog or cat or lizard that will make their life miserable, eat their socks and want to kill them. 

I  know LAOP says that they were gone for four days, but maybe the room mate said ""you know I'm moving out before the end of the month"" and LAOP said ""but my puppy"" and LAOP said, ""you know I'm a douche"" and LAOP said, ""but do me a solid"". And thus here we are. 

So that's my vote: LAOP told the room mate to baby sit, the roommate said this is the last straw, you know I'm leaving because we hate each other, and after a few days the roommate left the dog at a shelter. 

But the other stuff about the friends doing a positive ID based on a random picture in an animal shelter internet post, and the police? I dunno, maybe some fanciful embroidery on the actual story? I'd love to know what actually happened. It's been 18 hours and no followup from the LAOP so we may never know."

Anyway, I asked one of the club guys to hold baby dog while I walked out the 100 yards to where he'd finish. No biggy. Except they looked at him and thought eh a Golden...and next thing they knew he was flying down the 100 yards to me, as fast as he could run. 

This happened twice. Each time I had to go with him back to the start and tell them, he's a bouncy dog, HOLD HIM. Finally a small woman came over and said she could do it and she did. Those other guys had dog experience with their breed, but they looked at my baby dog as trivial because of his breed. 

And that's how people buy Golden Retrievers and get bitten and/or find the dog on the dinner table, enjoying the lasagna..."

A championship? Vs other dog sports? 

It can be as low as the entry fees and gas to get to a show. That would assume someone was comfortable showing their own dog and grooming their own dog. 

Or it can be the cost of a handler, and then for the handler to go back into the ring for things like best of winners, best of breed, and on and on, as well as the grooming. I found [this](http://www.showk9.com/rate_sheet) in a quick search.

As far as I know UKC prohibits pro handlers and if you live in an area with a lot of UKC shows and you want to start out in conformation, it's more forgiving. 

Dog sports such as obedience, agility etc aren't exactly cheap but you can put the time and money in them as you go. With conformation if a dog is ready to be shown, you want to get that over with before he loses coat or condition."

I won't rate them because I'm friends with some of them. :)

I would figure out when exactly you want a puppy. If it's in two years, I wouldn't be rushing out to contact them RIGHT NOW. I'd go to shows and watch the breed ring see what gets put up, see who's breeding those dogs, see if you personally **like** those dogs, and study the breed standard. There are dogs who do well in the breed ring that are just not my type of dog. And there are others that do well that are my type. You may see that there is someone breeding dogs who's dogs you just love, who is not currently on your list. 

I'd also be super honest with a breeder as far as what you want to do with the dog. Showing a Golden in conformation is not cheap or easy. They need a lot of grooming and it's a very competitive breed. If you like handling and you like grooming you may do ok, but many people wind up hiring a handler, especially for majors. 

Are you closer to any of them as far as distance goes? That should also play a factor. A good breeder if she lives close to you, will help you learn to groom and point you to a good puppy class and a good handling class.

I don't even know what you're saying here. Do you know how a good breeder culls a dog? They sell the dog on a spay/neuter contract so the dog won't be bred. It could be that the dog lacks the focus and interest in work that the breeder was looking for, or has a wry bite or a cowlick in the center of their face. No one is culling those dogs in the sense of killing them. They are culling them in that they are not going to be bred.

His disease is progressing, slowly, but if it starts to really impact his quality of life, we will make that hard decision to euthanize him. 

I don't regret doing the tie-back as it has eliminated his cough, and made his breathing easier, but that's pretty much the nuclear option for this disease. Beyond that, as it progresses, there's not much that can be done. 

With older dogs it's a hard choice. On one hand you might worry about people judging your decision but on the other hand you know how much your dog can tolerate and what their quality of life might be like.

Yes there are ways to work with a dog like this and to control him and manage him, but it's a lot of work, especially for someone who is new to dog ownership in general.

When the play goes over the top, a few things happen: the adult dog feels that he can't properly tell the puppy to stop, when it **is** a puppy and the dog doesn't want to treat the puppy as an adult and, the puppy is learning that he can do whatever the hell he wants, with no consequences. 

Dogs do play rough. They play with their teeth and they pounce and bounce. But when it escalates and it can do that in a second, it's important to stop it. 

Often times the over the top play is caused by a puppy who's been going going going all day and is like a toddler who needs to not be in Walmart but at home, in a quiet room, where she can take a fucking nap. They erupt into screaming or flailing or biting or whatever and no one wants to be near them. 

Once the puppy loses his license at about 7 or 8 months, the adult dog may well say, ya know, I took your shit for months and now you will pay. 

I am ok with a little bit of that: I am not ok with any adult dog seriously correcting a puppy, to the point of injuring the dog, and I'm really not ok with random dogs ""telling off the puppy"" or ""putting the puppy in his place"" or  ""teaching the puppy a lesson"" or whatever it is that people think happens. 

My job is to keep puppies safe so they don't get injured or mentally damaged. I don't need a random dog to try to kill my puppy for the crime of being a twit. I want my puppies to feel safe with me, and to understand that I will take care of them. That's erased by people allowing any dog to correct a puppy for the crime of being a puppy.

Yup!!! Which is why when someone has never owned a dog, or has never done conformation, goes to a breeder and says, I want to do it, they're going to ask some hard questions. 

Aside from the money, it's a time investment. If you like dog sports, and it's the big season for say agility or dock diving or whatever, AND the local kennel club is putting on a show and rumor is there will be majors, you have to decide what's important. And with a Golden you can't say, well I can dock dive at that show because they have a mobile dock, if you won't be in the ring till 3PM. The handler isn't going to want to get a soaking wet dog to then groom for the breed ring. 

I have friends in breeds that aren't as hair intensive or as numerically popular and they show their dogs and finish them on their own. Their issue is finding majors and again, it's about what do you want to do with the dog. If there are only a few a year in your area in your breed, you want to be there for them. 

In my area, Lab bitches need 94 of them to make a five point major. If  you had a Curly Coat, you'd only need six. The difference in showing is pretty vast and helps explain why some breeds have a preponderance of pro handlers while others do not."

I still miss her.  

Anyway, one of her daughters (married of course you heathens!!), was pregnant. And they found out that the fetus had a trisomy disorder, the one that causes Down Syndrome. 

And my neighbor talked to her daughter, told her the marriage wouldn't survive having a disabled child, and went with her to Planned Parenthood, where daughter had an abortion.  

My neighbor never regretted it. She spent a great deal of time thinking it all thru and felt that it didn't conflict with her core beliefs on God and religion.

Did the rescue group tell you that he's that reactive? And, how long have you had him?

Odds are this dog will always require exacting management, and will not wake up one day and ignore other dogs, especially if you can't afford to work with a trainer. Aggression issues are a thing that really needs a person to watch the dog and human interacting and see what the trigger is for the dog to launch. If you can not afford a trainer and you have not had this dog for long, you may want to consider returning the dog. 

But if you do keep this dog, always have him muzzled when you are out in public. No exceptions. 90 pounds of opinionated teeth who is lunging at other dogs, is a hair away from getting into some serious trouble."

And I wonder what happened to the room mate and why LAOP isn't worried about who's going to help pay the rent and utility bills. Anyway. 

First was this:

> Three months ago I adopted a pure bred Golden Retriever female puppy. I went to a respected adoption agency who sourced the puppy 

That's not how people **purchase** well bred and expensive dogs. It sounds like LAOP found some web site such as this [one](https://www.greenfieldpuppies.com) and bought a puppy that actually came from a [puppy mill](https://www.thepuppymillproject.org/amish-puppy-mills/). And hey it happens, but OP doesn't have a puppy [worth a truckload of money](https://www.greenfieldpuppies.com/golden-retriever-puppies-for-sale/). 

There are breeders who do follow a code of ethics from the [parent club](https://www.grca.org), which you can see in part [here](https://i.imgur.com/vh6cvmB.png). So again, I'm sure LAOP loved his/her dog regardless but I'm also pretty sure that dog came from some web site that is a front for puppy mills, and not a super expensive puppy. If LAOP is talking damages, there's a difference between a puppy that was $500 and one that was $3,000 or more. 

Next we have this:

>Four days into my trip I get a message from my friend group chat with a screencap of a local animal shelters ad for a dog that looked exactly like mine

I've had Golden Retrievers for decades. And I adore them, but when you have a [big group of them](https://twitter.com/RPFriesians/status/1021068769156685824?s=20) either really really know your dog, or put some [funky](https://i.imgur.com/oFfPKp1.png) collar on him. 

I don't believe that a small picture on a random local shelter group was identified by LAOP's friends as being the dog that LAOP owned. I've had people confuse my dogs, who really don't look that much [alike](https://i.imgur.com/g0Ctgjh.jpg). And that's in person, when they're looking at the actual dogs, vs a photograph. 

Years ago I boarded my first Golden at a boarding kennel. When I came to pick her up, two weeks later, out came a Golden, with my dog's collar and leash. And it was not my dog. The kennel help had mixed her up with someone else's dog. My dog had a small freckle in one ear, and aside from telling the kennel staff, ""WTAF??"" I was able to say, ""go get the Golden bitch who has an ear freckle!!"" I've always wondered if the other family had shown up first, if they would have gone home with my dog. And the answer is, I suspect they would have. 

LAOP said:

>I pull up the adoption records with my name on it, the microchip with my name on it and all the photos I have on my phone.

Well here's a picture of [my latest puppy](https://i.imgur.com/w617oqI.jpg). And most people who own Golden puppies or who owned a Golden puppy would happily tell me that their puppy looked just like my puppy. 


Anyway...

LAOP is in Washington State. [Washington has no laws about the length of holds on dogs in a shelter](https://www.animallaw.info/content/state-holding-period-laws-impounded-companion-animals). So a shelter may have a policy, but there's no actual law guiding it in Washington. If a puppy comes in on a Friday and there's some big adoption event scheduled on Saturday,  in theory, that puppy could be adopted out and gone before the shelter closes on Saturday. So the shelter in question could have had a 72 hour policy but that's not a law that they **have** to follow. 

And the puppy was spayed...Well that does happen at shelters, since they don't want more dogs coming in, but I'm trying to do the  math for how long they had the puppy before she was spayed and how long after that they adopted (actual adoption not purchase from a puppy mill web site), her out. I don't think most shelters would adopt out a very recently spayed puppy, because while it is routine surgery it's also abdominal surgery. The last thing anyone would want is for a puppy to start zooming around, all puppy-like in her new home, and wind up messing up sutures or getting the incision site dirty. 

And on to the police involvement. Twice. For something that doesn't sound like it would warrant it, as it's a he said she said thing with property. 

LAOP states that they started calling lawyers. I'm not sure what sort of lawyer would be called or how LAOP would sum up what happened? How would someone even know who to call? 

Finally I have no idea what happened, but I don't think the story being told here is exactly what did happen. I have heard verifiable stories of people going out of town and sticking friends or family with a pet to care for, and being gone for far longer than expected and/or not telling the baby sitter, that they were left in charge of a dog or cat or lizard that will make their life miserable, eat their socks and want to kill them. 

I  know LAOP says that they were gone for four days, but maybe the room mate said ""you know I'm moving out before the end of the month"" and LAOP said ""but my puppy"" and LAOP said, ""you know I'm a douche"" and LAOP said, ""but do me a solid"". And thus here we are. 

So that's my vote: LAOP told the room mate to baby sit, the roommate said this is the last straw, you know I'm leaving because we hate each other, and after a few days the roommate left the dog at a shelter. 

But the other stuff about the friends doing a positive ID based on a random picture in an animal shelter internet post, and the police? I dunno, maybe some fanciful embroidery on the actual story? I'd love to know what actually happened. It's been 18 hours and no followup from the LAOP so we may never know."

When middle dog was about 18 months old, we went to a [FAST CAT](https://www.akc.org/sports/coursing/fast-cat/). I think the local Ridgeback club was running it but I don't remember. 

Anyway, I asked one of the club guys to hold baby dog while I walked out the 100 yards to where he'd finish. No biggy. Except they looked at him and thought eh a Golden...and next thing they knew he was flying down the 100 yards to me, as fast as he could run. 

This happened twice. Each time I had to go with him back to the start and tell them, he's a bouncy dog, HOLD HIM. Finally a small woman came over and said she could do it and she did.

It can be as low as the entry fees and gas to get to a show. That would assume someone was comfortable showing their own dog and grooming their own dog. 

Or it can be the cost of a handler, and then for the handler to go back into the ring for things like best of winners, best of breed, and on and on, as well as the grooming. I found [this](http://www.showk9.com/rate_sheet) in a quick search.

As far as I know UKC prohibits pro handlers and if you live in an area with a lot of UKC shows and you want to start out in conformation, it's more forgiving.

I would figure out when exactly you want a puppy. If it's in two years, I wouldn't be rushing out to contact them RIGHT NOW. I'd go to shows and watch the breed ring see what gets put up, see who's breeding those dogs, see if you personally **like** those dogs, and study the breed standard. There are dogs who do well in the breed ring that are just not my type of dog. And there are others that do well that are my type. You may see that there is someone breeding dogs who's dogs you just love, who is not currently on your list. 

I'd also be super honest with a breeder as far as what you want to do with the dog. Showing a Golden in conformation is not cheap or easy. They need a lot of grooming and it's a very competitive breed. If you like handling and you like grooming you may do ok, but many people wind up hiring a handler, especially for majors. 

Are you closer to any of them as far as distance goes? That should also play a factor. A good breeder if she lives close to you, will help you learn to groom and point you to a good puppy class and a good handling class.

I don't even know what you're saying here. Do you know how a good breeder culls a dog? They sell the dog on a spay/neuter contract so the dog won't be bred. It could be that the dog lacks the focus and interest in work that the breeder was looking for, or has a wry bite or a cowlick in the center of their face.

His disease is progressing, slowly, but if it starts to really impact his quality of life, we will make that hard decision to euthanize him. 

I don't regret doing the tie-back as it has eliminated his cough, and made his breathing easier, but that's pretty much the nuclear option for this disease. Beyond that, as it progresses, there's not much that can be done.

Want a dog who can hang out with the kids and swim all day long in the lake and fetch and fetch and fetch and fetch? That's your dog. 

I think **humans** have to stop thinking ZOMG I saw a dog [here](https://www.tiktok.com/en/) and it was so cute and I need one.

dogs,fexyls3,t3_eqr9sk,1579438379.0,">I am a first-time dog ownerâ€”am I the right person to work on his aggression with him?

Honestly, no. I think you need to return this dog to the group you got him from. He's a project dog, and the person who owns him has to have a solid understanding of his triggers and how to manage him. 

Yes there are ways to work with a dog like this and to control him and manage him, but it's a lot of work, especially for someone who is new to dog ownership in general.  If you got a dog so you could have a companion on walks and take him places and explore the world together, this is not the dog to do it with. 

I know that people will tell you well you can do this and that and the other thing, but he will require life long management. He'll require that every walk outside of your apartment be planned and changed in a moment's notice if there are other dogs around. He'll require that you be very proactive and insistent when people want to say hello or allow their dogs to say hello. You can't do that, you have to advocate for him and not allow any of that to happen. 

For most new dog owners, this is exhausting and not at all what they envisioned when they went to a shelter to get a dog. Some people **want** project dogs and are fine with that, but new dog owners need something like complex. 

I have no idea how you'll live your life with Winston, which will require extreme planning for things that should be straight forward like going for a walk, or visiting the vet's office. If  you do decide to keep him, understand that there is no miracle for dogs like this, and he won't wake up one day and love the world. good luck."

Second is that when people say 9 hours they forget about those days when they have to pick up laundry go to the store, meet friends, stay late at work, etc. So it goes from 9 to who the hell knows.
