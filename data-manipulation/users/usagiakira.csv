AskReddit,fcxel4b,t3_ej7pm7,1578060871.0,"The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh

It's a realistic fiction about a foster kid trying to survive day to day life, being homeless, and trying to be not homeless when she turns 18. You learn more about her past as the main story progresses. It's my favorite book and the kind of book that you have to actually read to enjoy, so I can't do it enough good here by just telling you what it's about."
