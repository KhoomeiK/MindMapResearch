It is faster although that won't be very noticeable in real world scenarios but you also don't have to run any wires to it since it fits right into the motherboard. Something like [this](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/product/pxKcCJ/crucial-p1-1tb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-ct1000p1ssd8) or if you have a bit more budget [this](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/product/qBCD4D/adata-xpg-gammix-s11-pro-1-tb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-agammixs11p-1tt-c) or [this](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/product/zR3H99/adata-sx8200-1-tb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-asx8200pnp-1tt-c).
