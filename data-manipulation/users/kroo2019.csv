Whilst I understand your punishment what does your daughter learn from this if she is already showing no signs or remorse? 

Perhaps a punishment better fitting to the crime such as working with a volunteer service of some description to try and teach her a few life lessons and empathy may have more benefits. 

I would also be concerned following the lack of remorse whether the bullying will continue subtly as your daughter will feel anger now that the victim has caused her all this inconvenience."

He left his mum to sell the house on his behalf. We used to have debt collection letters through the door and when I told him my knowledge was he had to gone to New Zealand they said they would just close the account.

NoStupidQuestions,fdrgxgw,t1_fdrfkwk,1578684401.0,"That’s the New York Times stating their interpretation of several events. 

My point was I have never read an article, heard family or friends or the general public speak badly of her which was answering the question asked. 

The article you show refers to events which can be interpreted to fit all kinds of arguments. For example I’m a white female with ginger hair. That same photo of a chimpanzee was used in a light hearted way on my own social media whilst pregnant, by a friend in reference to what my baby will look like. Sometimes a joke is a joke and whilst it COULD have been meant in a certain way it doesn’t mean that’s how it was meant. 

I’m not saying that there hasn’t been any reference of racism because we have All probably been a victim of racism at one point or another. However someone asked if it’s really that strongly felt in this country and I genuinely do not believe that this is the case. 

It’s my opinion and nothing more."
LegalAdviceUK,fdrede7,t1_fdqzdoi,1578683326.0,"Or perhaps use the information first with a grievance to the company proving she had warned them of this and their failure to follow through with solutions.

Use the solicitor after other attempts have failed.  

Your wife will return to work and I imagine won’t want to rock the boat to that extent unless absolutely necessary. 

Speaking with acas or the union would be advisable. Some unions require you to be a member for so many days before they can assist so that might be worth checking with them before signing up (I believe unison have this requirement but not so sure about GMB. They may be a little more relaxed) working in care myself I recommend you wife joining a union recognised by her company ASAP.

NoStupidQuestions,fdrbwjd,t1_fdr2lu9,1578682299.0,"His mum ultimately died because she failed to put on a seatbelt. Evidence shows that had she of done so she would have walked away from that crash. 

I have never heard nor read any racist remarks made against Meghan. The only time racism has been discussed is when people like you throw it about as the only possible reason she could be disliked. 

If you recall the early days of their dating and marriage they were embraced by the public who welcomed her joining the Royal family why would that be the case if people were racist? Did they all become racist overnight or could it be her actions and behaviour that followed have quickly turned people against her."

Parenting,fdojno5,t3_emcc7p,1578606495.0,"I think it is a very long day for children however it sounds like the way the day would be broken up with various activities and the social side of things kind of balances out the bad. 

At this point you have nothing to loose by giving it a go. Are your children old enough / sensible enough to be able to contribute their thoughts on the matter? Maybe after a few months see how they are finding the day, if they feel it’s too much maybe then consider the mid week option. 

Life is about taking chances though and this sounds like a fun one to try!"
AmItheAsshole,fdoi50a,t3_em74cu,1578605619.0,"NAH - I myself (f) always wanted to adopt after having a few children ‘Naturally.’ My husband and I are very blessed to be comfortable financially and I wanted to provide a child, in need of a safe and loving home, a family.  

Since having our first child that desire has completely left me. The thought still crosses my mind from time to time but the drive and passion I once had is gone. I loved being pregnant and I can’t wait (hopefully) to fall pregnant again one day and relive the feelings and emotions. To know I was never going  to experience that again would be crushing for me. 

I don’t think you should be angry / hurt or any other feeling towards your wife. It sounds like she agreed with the original plan but she could never have foreseen this change of heart. Motherhood has changed the way I think and feel about certain things and I’m sure it’s reasonable to say this has likely happened in your wife’s case. 

Therapy sounds like a good course of action. You both need a safe place to talk honestly about your feelings and see if you can’t build a new life vision together. Could a compromise be reached? Would fostering be an option? There are many long term fostering placements needed these days and would be just as rewarding as adoption. 

Finally please fully understand the emotional implications of taking on an adopted / foster child. The traumas they have experienced can make this an intense, challenging and overwhelming roller coaster. You will be tested as individuals and as a couple. If one of you isn’t up to it or feels backed into a corner to go through with it  it could have a long term damage to your relationship. Is it worth loosing your current family for? 

Good luck to you all."
