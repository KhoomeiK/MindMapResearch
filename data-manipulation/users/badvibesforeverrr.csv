socialanxiety,ffb6dt5,t1_ffb4p9s,1579753006.0,senior year right now and I don’t even eat lunch because of anxiety. The line is too long and I don’t really got friends so if I do get lunch I’d be eating it by myself. Not only that but if the food is messy and I have to wipe my face I get anxious cause my lips start chapping when I wipe my face with a napkin.

depression,fefsad2,t3_eoxfgh,1579063696.0,It was my birthday today and just being born is the worst thing someone can give you. People say life is a gift I say that’s fucking bullshit. Pair this life shit up with anxiety and a sprinkle of depression and what do you get? You aren’t even living. And I don’t understand why people care about this shit like we are all gonna die anyway why even fucking put effort into anything?

Everyday I see her I get fucking sad as shit maybe it was cuz I never had the balls to actually talk to her in person.
