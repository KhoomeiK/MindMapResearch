Thanks!"
blackmagicdesign,ffgsonu,t1_ffggcve,1579914061.0,"Thanks man, I appreciate this. I ditched Adobe (after using it for almost ten years) for resolve/gimp and I’m ready to leap off a tall building lol I tried the color page thing, didn’t work. Can’t believe I gotta blur stuff in a separate program.

Sorry for venting I’m sure I’ll take shit for it but I dunno, being able to blur a png shouldn’t stall the workflow like this IMO.

Thanks again!"
blackmagicdesign,ffg5or4,t1_fffq0i7,1579899002.0,I'm afraid I don't know how to do any of that either. Thank you for the response though.
blackmagicdesign,fffoygi,t3_etdwsu,1579888643.0,"I feel like an idiot asking this question but I've tired looking online and can't find a solution (probably using incorrect search terms but I've exhausted my limited vocabulary). I'm sure there is a very simple solution to this. Both gaussian and lens blur create this issue.  


Thankfully this is just a dinky little video that I'm doing in my spare time but I know this will become an issue during a client video eventually so best to find the solution now rather than holding up a paid gig."
blackmagicdesign,fffoat6,t3_espxwx,1579888242.0,"I have the same gimbal/camera, I use the camera in the full ""Smallrig"" P4K cage so I can offset it for better balance. It's a fantastic gimbal, so fun to use that I always have to remind myself to use it sparingly. If you're looking for a m4/3 lens and have the money I would suggest picking up a Lumix 12-35 f/2.8, it's pricey but it practically lives on my P4K.

The camera is packed with useful features, I would learn everything I could about the ""false color"" setting (under monitor in the menu) and set is as one of the custom buttons on the top of the camera so you can quickly turn it on/off and check your exposure and skin tones. I'm not sure if someone brought this up yet but sticking with ISO 400 and 4000 will give you the widest dynamic range. You already made the best possible decision; reaching out for help. You'll get a ton of critique on every video for the first year or two, at least I did. Some people were very blunt and it's really hard to not take things personally but there is usually great advice in every comment, even if they sound like an asshole lol  


Congrats on taking the big step!"
blackmagicdesign,fffmvpj,t1_ffcbsio,1579887385.0,I was also going to say this. It's very common for people to just use a gimbal for their entire video even when there is nothing to motivate the movement on screen and they end up with a video that has nothing but wide shots.
