and i understand that. i honestly just don't know what i'm expected to do. i know it's not just gonna appear from thin air, her caloric intake needs probably just went way down so that the amount she ate before suddenly became a massive excess; all i was saying is that her chronic pain made that happen, but what she said was that her doctor and parents act like her obesity caused the chronic pain instead of the chronic pain leading to obesity in a short time period because it made it so hard for her to move."

and problems from obesity do continue after they lose weight because of the nature of the damage it does to the body. it's a risk factor, and solving it won't solve the problems it causes once they're there. and that's a real issue with how the medical establishment treats obesity. obese people do get their problems ignored by shit doctors who think all their problems are just the obesity itself and that they'll go away once the it's solved even though the problems it causes are permanent.

but haes doesn't focus on that; they focus on rhe classification of obesity, a risk factor for numerous health problems, and act like it's some kind of personal attack or oppression that obesity is associated with health problems ***when it is.*** obese people should get their problems looked at *more,* because it's a risk factor for like, everything, not *less,* like haes wants."

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ffccia4,t1_ffc6cm2,1579796491.0,"feel like that'd work. all oppression ultimately has some element of classism, if not being ultimately derived from it.

colorism? exists because darker skin is associated with working in the fields. whiter skin = richer, and beauty standards revolve around the rich because they control the standards, and for them, poor is bad. since field workers are poor, and poor is bad, rich people say poor is ugly, using beauty standards as a method of controlling the working class.

sexism? a working woman is seen as poor because rich women can afford not to work. rich men use class to oppress women; beauty standards and standards of femininity are almost always things originally only achievable by the rich, or associated with the rich. traits associated with the working class (brashness, vulgarity, being ""unclean,"" ect.) are seen as undesirable in women. from the ultimate stigmatization of things considered to be ""feminine"" comes homophobia.

racism, meanwhile, literally came from justifying slavery from antiguity by preying on the human instinct that the unknown is scary to benefit the interests of the wealthy.

back to the topic...a child is not a mere choice. it is, but it is no small choice. without support, due to the toll having a child takes on her body, and the fact that people generally wait until they can make sure they can support and take care of their kid as best they can, people will just not have kids. it already happens in japan and korea, where the birth rate has dropped severely low due to expectations of japanese mothers and the fact that many worry they won't be able to support the kid. it can take a massive toll on a women's body, and ultimately, having a kid benefits society as a whole by ensuring its continuation and ensuring there'll be a workforce when the parents get old. maternity leave is important, or they might not have kids. paternity leave is also important, because kids are hard work, and it takes a village, as they say. helps the mother recuperate faster, and gives the father time to bond with his kid. win-win situation for everyone. it really does take a village to raise a child."

anyway, the way my school does it, the grades you get in IB classes are still part of the GPA because they wanted to be ~special,~ and the IB program is only two of four years, anyway. they count your IB grades into GPA because they do have letter-grade equivalents. and 37 points? lmao come on. only *37 points* for six classes plus TOK? that's like, a four or five in all your classes, assuming you got all three bonus points from TOK.

and don't act snooty cuz you got a six anywhere, either. accounting for all your classes plus TOK, the most you could have gotten anywhere is a six, if i'm being nice about TOK and assuming you worked equally in all your classes. that's nothing special, people get sixes all the time. more likely, you got some fives (which most teachers teach for anyway), two points of TOK, and ma6be a sux. what were your HLs, business? only way for you to get a seven and pass would be if you barely scraped by in TOK or some other class.

which is likely, because you seem to be american and have abhorrent grammar and vocabulary. you clearly didn't HL in language arts; your spelling mistakes are too consistent to be typos. no way someone like *that* could make summa cum laude unless you were just in a class of trash.

and there you go touting your parent's achievements again! you're (note the correct use of ""you're"") only so ""great"" because you stand on mommy and daddy's shoulders! that has jack shit to do with you. i had to not only work hard, but also work hard enough to get a scholarship for everything i have ever done, with a disabled mom (with a masters in marine oceanography, by the way) and a worthless, deadbeat dad who dropped out in 8th grade. i couldn't just have mommy and daddy pay for it. i had to be the best. and i did it with mental illness, undiagnosed adhd, and starting from special education. so come down a peg and realize you're not special. your parents? amazing, they're some damn good role models. you? a pathetic, mediocre frat boy who stands on your mommy and daddy's shoulders.

money ain't everything, baby. your focus on money making you worth something makes you sound like that guy who wound up on Choosing Beggars because he thought fucking *Red Lobster* was classy. i mean, look at the man in the white house. a failure who's lost every business he's ever run, with a nine-digit net worth. even the best anthropologist in the world's not getting more than five figures, doesn't mean they're not the best.

that being said, it is field-dependent, and in your field? a five-digit income on a *graduate's* degree? are you a highschool teacher? do you work at *mcdonalds*? you fucking suck at your field; a grad degree can get you six figures easy in any of the prerequisite degrees for med school if you were any good at all. my mom would make six figures if she wasn't sick. there's a reason that there's a teacher shortage, and that's because a graduate's degree is worth a lot more than five figures if you're not fucking trash.

when you're poor, you have to be the best to get anywhere. when you're rich, you just have to be mediocre. i might not make much money as an adult, true, i might have a few student loans, maybe, but at least i can have the satisfaction of knowing i'm not just some mediocre, snooty-ass frat boy who's only there because of daddy's money, and that'll keep me going."

i'm getting recruitment from unviersity of chicago, university of washington, uc berkeley, hell, i even got one of the seven sisters recruiting me. i qualify for the national merit scholarship. and on top of that, i did all this living in poverty, with adhd that was only diagnosed sophomore year of high school, and numerous mental health problems that have plagued me my entire life. my poor attention span and memory are all that still hold me back from having a 4.0 gpa in the international baccalaureate program. and to top it all off, i started off nonverbal, in special education. i don't live that well, my family is poor and my mother is an immigrant with health problems. i have mental health problems and i have to work hard just to function. but at least my achievements are from my work, my effort. my mom helped me find the opportunities, but i was the one who had to get them.

being top 1% of your class means jack shit when there's so many shitty doctors who make it through anyway. top 1% of a pile of shit is still shit, buddy. please never work with women if you are in med school and don't know the toll birth takes on a woman's body. what a waste of a scholarship that could have gone to someone who works twice as hard as you."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff1e4wo,t1_ff1d4oz,1579478032.0,"they do it for their characters, to look more like the character. the best actors will CHANGE THEIR BODIES FOR THEIR ROLES. vincent d'onofrio gained a lot of weight for his role as detective goren. when shia labouf did holes, he actually had to be stopped from doing the same thing because of his age at the time. women shave their heads. carrie fisher lost like, 50% of her body weight for princess leia. the best actors will do that."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ff16qw2,t1_ff152ht,1579475784.0,"hate to break it to ya, but shit acting with a pretty face just doesn't cut it for movies. people want actors who can act, first and foremost. no matter how beautiful it is, if the acting is absolutely fucking unbearable, or the story and lines are ridiculous, no one's gonna wanna sit through the whole movie. think about why benedict cumberbatch or adam driver are popular; trust me, it ain't their faces. think about why people hate dc movies so damn much, even though they cast people attractive enough they fall into the uncanny valley, and their special effects are phenomenal.

you can support as much shitty softcore pornography as you want. but just know that people want actors...who can act. people want compelling stories, people want engaging stories; no amount of pretty is gonna cut it unless you're watching porn."
