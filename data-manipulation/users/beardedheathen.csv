LegendsOfRuneterra,fft7wb2,t1_fft52yf,1580211464.0,I think that's a fairly ignorant thing to say. How are you going to objectively measure that one narrative is interior to another merely because of length. Are short stories inferior to novels? Are poems inferior to both because of length? You are degrading an art form as inferior merely because it is part of polar culture ignoring that nearly all forms of art were pop art when they were created.

Pathfinder_RPG,ffsy2ae,t1_ffsx4ei,1580197284.0,">Good Good implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the dignity of sentient beings. Good characters make personal sacrifices to help others.

>Evil Evil implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others. Some evil creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without qualms if doing so is convenient. Others actively pursue evil, killing for sport or out of duty to some evil deity or master.

>Neutral People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have compunctions against killing the innocent, but may lack the commitment to make sacrifices to protect or help others.

Pathfinder_RPG,ffswwe8,t1_ffrdj6p,1580195800.0,"Evil is different than selfishness. Evil personally delights in pain and suffering as much as good delights in compassion and saving. Still interest is going to be neutral. You don't care about the cosmic scale of Justice only that you get what is best for you. 

A good test is if your character is placed in a room with a bag of gold and an innocent chained on the wall with a devil that tells them that every coin they take hurts the person and if you take all of them they will die. 

The evil person will take them all maybe one by one so they person suffers more or maybe just taking the bag. 

A neutral person will probably take some. Maybe promising to share with the person when they get out. 

The good person will refuse and attempt to free the person."

YangForPresidentHQ,ffqjhnu,t1_ffpu3xq,1580136305.0,To some extent they do but the labels are thrown around as a way to shut people down when they don't adhere to every single policy point.

Regardless instead of trying to speak for minorities or shit people out or down because they are x or y we should talk to them and understand them.
