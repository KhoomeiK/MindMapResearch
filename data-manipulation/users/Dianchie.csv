BTSWorld,ffszk9z,t1_ffdnhtm,1580199257.0,The time travel universe. There’s a webcomic and the albums include small bits of the story.
Celiac,ffpzh8r,t3_eugqwm,1580112315.0,"Come to Vancouver! It’s a beautiful city with many things to see/do. The Vancouver Aquarium is a must. If you go to White Rock which is a pretty easy bus ride out of Vancouver, there’s a dedicated allergy/gluten free bakery called Pikanik that will make you forget the food is GF. There’s tons of restaurants that are GF or prepare things in a separate space to ensure no cross contamination."
bangtan,ffpy7ea,t3_et5kzq,1580110604.0,Yoongi. My fiancé is just like him. They both like to sleep and are impossible to rouse in the mornings. His favourite possession is also my fiancé's: money. They are both extremely intelligent and creative. They're also the exact same height.
fatlogic,ffgn4t4,t3_etg8n6,1579910109.0,My anorexia never developed because I wanted to be like Barbie. In fact I hated dolls as a child. My anorexia developed because it gave me some semblance of control.
bangtan,ff0tbpa,t3_eqzvhx,1579472061.0,West coast of North America exists too... Vancouver would be a nice place for them to hold a concert
tea,fezrkf2,t1_fete77g,1579460745.0,I genuinely like Starbucks tea! Rev Up and Earl Grey are my usual picks. The Earl Grey does have lavender so just a warning in case you don’t like it.
fatlogic,feup1tw,t1_fepcquc,1579388680.0,I was one of those. Never touted HAES or FA rhetoric. I ended up with BED because I decided I would do a good job with recovery and allow myself to eat anything I wanted. It morphed into BED. I’m doing much better now though.
fatlogic,feuomeq,t1_feonlhl,1579388527.0,"I went from anorexia to binge eating disorder. I was 82lbs then I got up to 215lbs. I’m doing much better and I’m at a healthy weight now. It’s a struggle for the anorexia to not take over. Interestingly enough, I don’t struggle with binge eating."
kpop,fej4qgr,t1_feila4f,1579156845.0,I’m seeing him in Vancouver in March and I’m so excited!
dogs,fecam8i,t1_febpyhm,1578969662.0,"He just kept growing and growing. He's not fat, just big. He finally stopped growing when he was about 3 so that might be why."
dogs,fea6cwv,t1_fe9l4k6,1578944870.0,I love RR. All the ones I have met have been cuddly and the size of a gazelle. They're so happy to be with their people and be loved on. They're great for active families.
dogs,fea4atl,t1_fe988mk,1578944227.0,"My Rottweiler is the same way. He's 160lbs of cuddles and love. I cannot do anything without at least his head being in my lap. If I'm on the couch, he transforms into a lapdog that reminds me more of a large bear."
fatlogic,fe5ajzw,t1_fe0do4u,1578867055.0,I lost 70lbs and I am still a 38D-DD and I hate it. I just want smaller boobs
vaxxhappened,fe06ik5,t3_enbwgx,1578804309.0,"I need weekly B12 shots. They're terribly painful and make every nerve feel like it's on fire but they keep me going so I do it. Vitamin shots are not even vaccines. Even if they were, they can save lives, but these people are too stupid to understand that."
LuLaNo,fdhm4ng,t3_el5whq,1578425564.0,These would all make for excellent pyjama sets but not at the price she’s likely asking
52book,fdftgr6,t3_ekwafq,1578369782.0,I read physical and ebooks in almost equal amounts. Whatever is easiest to get from the library.
52book,fdfot7x,t3_ekcs3z,1578366646.0,"I have read for books so far this year:

1. Renegades - Marissa Meyer
2. Bounce House - Jennica Harper
3. The Never Tilting World - Rin Chupeco
4. Men Without Women - Haruki Murakami

I DNF'd ""Forest of Memory"" by Mary Kowal. While the concept interested me a lot, the intentional typos killed the novella for me and turned me off from the story.

Currently I am reading ""The Library Book"" by Susan Orlean and ""Someone Who Will Love You In All Your Damaged Glory"" by Raphael Bob-Waksberg.

""The Library Book"" is being used for a reading challenge prompt: A book on a subject you know nothing about. I literally had no idea that the LA library fire even happened at the end of the 80s so I figured that it would be a good choice for the prompt. While ""Someone Who Will Love You"" is because I am on a short story kick and these ones are particularly funny. I'm obviously not the only one who had been enjoying this anthology, because this copy was obtained by the library in September, 2019 and it looks quite well worn."
Rottweiler,fcturwo,t1_fcpdxxv,1577960597.0,I’m finishing up “Renegades” by Marissa Meyer. I read several difficult books and then decided to throw in an easy YA novel that’s been quite enjoyable so far!
books,fcrdi78,t1_fcq6xp1,1577900365.0,"I agree with you on Shakespeare. It’s funny because I can read other plays and writers from that time, but I don’t really understand anything he’s saying. I love the play “Le Cid” by Corneille and had no issues understanding it. I think I have a Shakespeare allergy"
books,fcrd5zp,t1_fcpgsis,1577900237.0,"My fiancé is a high school English teacher, and at least from what I know, he doesn’t read to the students. He has detailed notes written inside the books that he’ll reference if he forgets a part. He will read Shakespeare with the students but he makes sure each semester a different selection is used to keep things interesting. In his case, he’s not re-reading the novels every year. I’m a social studies teacher and thankfully, I have a lot of choice when it comes to novels. For my senior history students, I have a list of 20th century novels and I have my students do a visual project with whatever they chose to read."
books,fcidstc,t3_eh9vyc,1577661048.0,I constantly visit my local used bookstore for this reason. I never want it to go out of business
