PoliticalHumor,ff6t9dy,t1_ff6s36j,1579634417.0,"You're right for sure,  there's a certain majority of gun owners that are more comfortable with racism though and I feel like that is louder than the intended message. 

I say that as a leftist gun owner."

antiwork,fes77bc,t1_ferlx23,1579362118.0,"Exactly, he's said as much in the past. I'm pretty sure he does identify as a democratic socialist. Even to that degree I don't think he'd talk about that as much. It's better for his campaign if he just focused on moderate to what America calls liberal issues from a SocDem standpoint to get into the area of democratic socialism....I mean, hopefully...at least? It's a weird timeline right now."
