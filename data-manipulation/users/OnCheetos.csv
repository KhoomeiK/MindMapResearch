gynecomastia,ffgu7js,t3_et5bq3,1579915175.0,In the same spot. Gained 70 pounds after college (have unilateral gyno) and then lost 63 pounds of that 70. Now I got that weird loose skin on the side under the armpit.
virgin,ff5my80,t3_errcex,1579600962.0,"Define good life?  my reply isn’t hate towards what u said. I agree. But my novel like response is just to give u an idea on why people may disagree.

For me good life at 20 your age is completely different at age 27 now. 

Speaking on the Virgin deal when I was 20 I didn’t give two shits. Hell I didn’t give two cares until i turned 26. When you are 20 most of your fellow 20 year olds are still mostly  virgins. I dare say at age 24 that’s the age the late bloomers quote on quote finally get it in that by age 25 and above you are one in the few still a Virgin

Speaking in terms of employment I still work retail at age 27. I hate to break it to you but college is overrated not a guarantee . I have an associate and a bachelors in law and Finance and still can’t break in. It’s who you know is what I found out. When I was 20 in college I thought I’m in college I will find work easy nope. Everyone is in college and every 20 year old generally has a college education. A college degree doesn’t hold weight like it used to. 

The point of this reply is not to be a Debbie downer but simply being a person who can provide how it feels to be still not self sufficient living with your parents still in your late twenties. The funny thing is a lot of folks in their young 20s will read this and go that won’t be me. For some yea but for many it will. Don’t believe me? Go to my profile and look at my post history history. Look up my post titled “Fuck Employers” and look how many likes I got on that post just to give u an idea on how hard it’s to be self sufficient.

I agree the Virgin deal isn’t a big deal at all but it Sucks not to be able to look back and experience it. They always say a life without experiences is a life wasted so again yea if I was 7 years younger sure I don’t care but at age 30 aka I’m knocking on 30 kinda want it to eventually happen since everyone in their late 20s has generally lost it

dating_advice,fefqub3,t3_eowwni,1579062571.0,"Try tinder what do u have to lose but here is my warning tho

 I know I’m going to get heat for this but it’s all about looks /good interesting photos and women control the flow. Not just tinder but in all dating apps in general. 


What I mean about looks is online dating has the disadvantage of not conveying what the person is actually like. That even writing a bio won’t guarantee a good grasp on the person. For ex I went out with a woman on Bumble and nine dates in I offered to go hiking as she put in her bio I love to hike and I kid you not she said I don’t like hiking that much.... so both men and women can fabricate their stuff on there. Plus 70 percent of it is just photos. Again online dating only captures a moment of u (pictures)  and because bios can be stretched or fabricated people tend to be more inclined to swipe on people that are good looking or interesting aka you don’t have photos of just being in your house. 

Real life interaction dating is all about personality because u can get a feel of what the person is like. Plus I hear nightmare stories of bad online dates as well as matches ghosting u.

Just make sure u got good photos and u should be solid"
offmychest,fee4wcx,t1_fee49js,1579026455.0,"Right? I will talk to some of my matches and they would flake or ghost me when I would talk about meeting. I would suggest meeting at a popular place where a lot of people would be at and I would encourage her to bring friends male or female just to make her comfortable but nope. 

Glad u are in a good space too friend all the best"
