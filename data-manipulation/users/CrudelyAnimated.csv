In every version of the Joker mythos, Batman was directly responsible for creating the Joker. The Joker sees himself as Batman's nemesis, the two of them locked in a perverse game of order and chaos. The Joker conceives ever more sophisticated plans, using decoy targets and gadgets and poisons of his own design. The Joker is brilliant and devious, more interested in Batman than in the police or the rich. Even Ledger's anarchist Joker aimed his chaos specifically at unmasking the Batman.

In this movie, Joker is a poor, mentally challenged, middle-aged man who lashes out at his own disenfranchisement. The names ""Gotham"" and ""Wayne"" are invoked, for no particular reason but to create a fictitious daddy issue plot. The Waynes were assassinated by a righteous-minded protestor, not a criminal with mob ties. ""The Joker"" is responsible for all this, 20 years before Bruce ever dons the cowl. How is this The Joker's story, in any way?

I say this because it's meaningful. Lex Luthor isn't just a bad guy; he resents Superman's existence because Superman distracts humans from reaching their own potential. Luthor is a proud, militant humanist with a considerable following. Sinestro was a Green Lantern, a respected leader of men. He believed the Guardians' philosophy to be willfully naive, and that is why he resents them and Hal Jordan for his excommunication. **The difference between a bank robber and an arch-nemesis is resentment**, and Arthur Fleck had no reason to resent the Batman. Invoking the names Joker and Gotham and Wayne was utter theft. This wasn't any more The Joker than it was Fight Club or Office Space, and they didn't spend half the movie on bad Tai Chi and mood music."
