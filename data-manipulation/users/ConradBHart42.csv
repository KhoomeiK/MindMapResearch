I'd say this isn't the BIGGEST fuckup as there's a lot of time when I moved back home and got a job where I was enjoying life and even though the jobs were menial the people I worked with were great and eventually I had a position where I felt secure and like I could take my skills through the company ladder given time.

The bigger fuckup was when I asked for a transfer from one store to another at that ""secure"" job.  I went from an environment where I was reasonably liked and my boss saw me as indispensable (figuratively) to one where my boss saw me as a threat and no one wanted to hear what I had to say about policy.  A couple of months later I was fired, more or less on a pretext, because I was unpopular with the rest of the staff.

Also I only came to the conclusion that it was Charlie because someone suggested that it was a different character who is sitting on a high chair.  [This Photo](https://imgur.com/Fy5rPel) makes it clear that the man is at least standing on something to give him such a great height over Mr. C and he also has similar hair, glasses, and chin as Charlie."

It's also the part of the eye that Sarah would see if she's looking at Leland while he's leering at Laura. 

There's an old saying ""don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes"", so I think ""the horse is the white of the eyes"" is way of equating one omen of death with another.  In a way I think it's just filler that's meant to let us bake our noodles.  

But also, ""White Horse"" equates to the drugged milk.  The milk being a ""Trojan Horse"" to deliver the drugs within, and naturally milk being white.  Drink deep and descend."
twinpeaks,fdxg64c,t3_emoz0d,1578768428.0,"I've had an idea wiggling in the back of my mind about Audrey lately.  She is the most obvious candidate for ""the dreamer"".  But she is a prisoner in her dream, physically and spiritually.  the coma forces her to sleep, and nefarious forces of the Black Lodge keep her from waking up.  Why?  It's unclear to me how this is advantageous to them.  In her dream (as in the waking world), she had a son.  BOB's presence corrupted him into a force of pure malice.  Who is Charlie?  He is her jailer, manipulating her into patterns to keep the dream stable, unbreakable.  I believe Charlie is the man we see shaking Mr. C's hand at the box in NYC.  

Laid out this way I think the natural conclusion is that Mr. C set it up so that Charlie keeps Audrey in the dream, and Mr. C uses the dream, perhaps to hide, perhaps just to move from place to place, probably for something we don't quite understand.  

It also strikes me as possible that the Box is a/the way in and out of the dream, and Cooper's brief visit was meant to shunt him into the dream (and may have succeeded) to keep him from escaping to the waking world."
