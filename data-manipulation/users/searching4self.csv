AskReddit,ff94e9n,t1_ff8ph0f,1579704571.0,A lot of the examples I'm seeing below are due poor or blatantly wrong reporting on the scientific findings. Rarely would it be for the actual peer reviewed article to be under such scrutiny.

Huge congrats to this person for for finding the signal, and realizing it's a planet in a binary star system. That's amazing and even still highly non trivial. But to think this kid is the next Einstein from this discovery alone would be a joke."

Trump and every single one of his supporters are fucktards but choosing to shit on the electoral college now is cringy. If we really cared we should be fighting every day to remove the electoral college. I don't see any agreement on that idea from any party."
science,fdmpe0i,t1_fdmalf6,1578559261.0,"Well truthfully we don't even know much about these planets to begin with. For example, this planet doesn't have a robust mass measurement, so it's density is not well constrained. So as far as what this planet is made of is a mystery. We can probe its atmosphere with the same method used to discover the planet. But to know what the planet itself is made of will take time."

We can look at one's upbringing and try to point fingers here and there, but I think it's ""simply"" a failure of the US education system, from maybe middle school through college.
