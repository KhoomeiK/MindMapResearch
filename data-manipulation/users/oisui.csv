This holds you accountable and forces you to work based on your environment and those in it. If everyone else is studying, then you'll be predisposed to studying as well. Additionally, I would recommend figuring out why you're procrastinating. Figure out the underlying root cause. Is it because studying is boring? Why is it hard for you to focus? Is it because of your environment? Are you sufficiently breaking down your tasks? Asking questions like these might help you to get out of your own way and move on.

SkincareAddiction,fdz2mfu,t3_en87c0,1578786016.0,"Yes, I do! I usually use a lot of hydrating sleep masks overnight and I just rinse them off in the morning. I don't think there's a need to really cleanse my face in the morning as there's not much on besides whatever I put on last night (it should have absorbed overnight anyways). I've been doing so for the past week and my skin is much more hydrated and plump. When I used to cleanse it in the morning, it was quite drying and I found that throughout the day, my skin would just feel almost rough and dry. Now, I just splash my face with water, pat it and then immediately put hyaluronic acid. I might follow up with toner, but only a small amount. My evening routine is the most important because I need to thoroughly wash all the junk off my face, but my morning routine is relatively simple. I'm glad you're noticing a change with this subtle switch aha :D"

getdisciplined,fdsg5nj,t3_emx1qs,1578702045.0,"Hmm, well, let's tackle the base of the issue. You tend to put others and their opinions/perspectives before yours. Consider why. I think it's important for you to consider the root of the issue and why it's like that. This may take a bit of probing, but it'll help you understand yourself much more.

After all that probing, it's time for you to rework all of your past limiting beliefs. The way I see it, there is so much everlasting potential in you. You have so much to be grateful for, but also to look forward to. You're strong. You're loving. You're kind. You're capable of positive change and transformation. You're worthy. All these statements are affirmations of sorts, but they're helpful. Over time, they become so seamless and you embody each and every one of them. It's hard when you feel as if others and their opinions and thoughts are more important compared to yours. However, you also need to figure out why you feel that. Why? And what can you do about it? What can you do or rework (+how) that will allow you to feel better? Your relationship with yourself is the most important and longest relationship you'll ever have. You are you. There are so many things to love about you and you should take the time to always recognize that. It's gonna take time, but find daily things you can do to take care of yourself and by extension, express love for yourself.

Sending love and positivity your way!"

I think it just gives me hope and a burst of positivity. Long term, I think its healthy to allow yourself to feel whatever it is you're going through. Cease and arise.  Feel, but don't let yourself anchor yourself down to these hard time. Just keep floating. Know that you love yourself and there's something better waiting for you as long as you persist and push yourself. You can do it!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fdr1es8,t1_fdr19v5,1578678204.0,"I haven't really done fitness themes before. I think it would be interesting. I plan on joining the gym in the next week or two, so that would be interesting. If you could focus on a theme, what would it be?"
getdisciplined,fdqzx91,t3_emj9bv,1578677645.0,"I think so, but it also depends on what you're doing. From past experience, I am suggest doing a brain dump of what you're learning. What are you good at? What do you need to improve? What do you need to learn? Taking all of these into account gives you a good scope and understanding of where you're at. After doing this, focus on what you want or need to improve and work on. Break these down and prioritize them. Obviously, there are things you need to know before learning other aspects, so remember that and don't go too crazy jumping from one topic without knowing an important foundational topic. Once you've broken em down into chunks, set a block of time or just schedule them in for days. This is where your planning method comes in. All I suggest is be realistic with how much you pack in a day and also specify how long you're going to work on it. Taking care of yourself and giving room to explore and chill is important too. Don't let yourself drown in ambition. Remember, you need time to also appreciate and do other activities and whatnot. I hope that helps!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fdqz5yh,t3_emszrp,1578677190.0,"Hmm, I suggest you create your own goals and follow through with them. Maybe you have something you're interested in that you want to work on or look into? Additionally, you can ask for more work, but if not, I think researching and looking into things you want to do or delve into deeper is a good place to start!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fdqz04x,t3_emtmin,1578677094.0,"Hmm, I think I try to complete or follow through with things that are important. For example, I've been trying to prioritize 1-3 tasks each day that are the most important. When I finish these, it's great because I've completed my main goal for the day. Additionally, each habit I follow through with daily or weekly is important as their completion leaves me feeling good physically, spiritually and emotionally. One thing I'm fond of is setting a theme for a week or month and then creating mini tasks or habits that lead to its completion. For example, my goal for January is to find what's meaningful to me / to find what makes me happy. This does require a lot of experimentation and pushing myself to go out more, but that's the goal. I think little mini themes for the month or week just make my days more fun because I'm working towards something that I have an emotional tie too. I hope that helps!"

I just need to put in a block of time (very small amount of time) that allows me to start and from there, I continue. Really like this :) thanks for posting it! I think I'm going to just schedule in 10 minutes for each habit and then to go from there. Of course, for some habits, it's probably better if I have a list of things to follow or do as well."

getdisciplined,fdlks15,t3_ekrizh,1578526249.0,"It's a bit late, but I've been in an odd state this past week; so, let's plan the rest of the evening (with the tasks completed before added for general reference0

\[ - \] wake up at 10 am

\[x\] wash up and do a.m skincare

\[x\] stretch

\[x\] pray

\[x\] meditate

\[x\] make late brunch and eat

\[x\] have a cup of tea

\[x\] order some stationary online (i need a pick me up aha TT)

\[x\] help lil bro with homework

\- i helped him, but let's just say i was mad; he didn't do that well on his math test, and i'm suspecting it's because (a) he gets way too caught up in the idea of failing and (b) he sucks at planning and breaking things down. we both talked and we agreed he just needs to keep trying and pushing himself to grow. tomorrow, i plan on helping him break down his math test that's happening next week, so let's hope it works out well ;; (lucky for him it was me, if our older sister was, expect a lecture that would never end lmao)

\[ x\] grab dinner and another cup of tea

\[x\] send a text to a friend

\- she's been feeling a bit down, so i want to check up on her

\[- ***pushed to tomorrow*** \] rework habit tracker and general plan for the week (priority 1)

\- i need to rework this today/tomorrow and plan things out in a way, where they are spaced out well. sometimes, i can cram way too much in, so i'm going to try prioritizing 1-2 tasks that must get completed and everything else after is open to do.

\[ x\] help cousin with essay

\- need to edit an essay that is due tomorrow

\- read an essay he got back today; he wants some feedback

\[x*\] journal (priority 2)

\- i feel way off emotionally and i think i need to have an honest and loving conversation with myself. probably cry too, so hahaha can't wait for that

\[-\] watch a studio ghibli movie (any recs? i've watched most of them, so any pick me up would be nice)

- gonna watch this tomorrow,, watched mamma Mia instead 

\[-\] read 10 pages of a book

\[-\] sleep at 12-1 am and set alarm for 7:30 am
- probably gonna sleep later just so i can ease my body instead of going cold turkey 
\- slowly trying to fix my sleep schedule"

Update: I took an impromptu nap somehow and I think I'm just feeling sick or I'm extremely under the weather. It sucks because I wanted to work toward my goals, but I realize that there are things I need to reflect over and let go before I can do so. Regardless, I will spend tonight just relaxing and letting myself be. Not forcing myself to work towards anything for the sake of doing. It seems I have a lot of mental and emotional decluttering to do this week. Have a wonderful night ‚ô°"

Move around, stretch, go make something to eat, etc. If you feel really tired. I recommend that you take a nap for 30-60 minutes. It doesn't have to exceed an hour, but taking a nap will help you reduce the likelihood of crashing. Besides that, just pace yourself! I hope your day/ goes very well ‚ô° once you're done though, I recommend sleeping as soon as you can. Maybe let yourself sleep in a bit, if possible~"
