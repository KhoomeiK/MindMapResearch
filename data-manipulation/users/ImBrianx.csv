apexlegends,fflboqa,t3_eu3gyf,1580037481.0,I got the worst heirloom in my opinion; lifeline heirloom which made me sad as a wraith main.
apexlegends,ffe99qp,t3_et52rm,1579840222.0,Season 1 of ranked or series 1 whatever but she is definitely better. I literally have 1k kills on Watson and 2k kills on caustic I know what I’m talking about. Watson is better.
apexlegends,ffe8xg5,t1_ffe8nz1,1579839941.0,Trust me I pushed season 1 pred with watts on and she was A LOT better than caustic. If solos we're a thing then most definitely but in the end it's all down to playstyle I guess.
apexlegends,ffe8jw4,t3_et52rm,1579839632.0,I kinda agree but caustic is already inferior to watts on in so many ways that I feel like he needs it
apexlegends,ffe7xsu,t3_et52rm,1579839134.0,His gas could always destroy fences

apexlegends,ffdnikl,t1_ffctr6w,1579824649.0,"If sbmm wasn't in the game I wouldn't care if I saw a squad like this was champion because it wouldn't happen as often. it's just that EVERY game I play by myself I being targeted by the system and placed into these games constantly. So, every time Im playing by myself I'm inherently in a loosing match. For instance, if my teammates we're to 1v1 a member of the champion squad they would lose most of of the times because they're not at that skill level.  Hell I wouldn't be surprised if both of them couldn't take out one of these guys. So technically because I'm at a higher level not many people can perform the same so I get what I call ”filler teammates”, teammates given to me just to finish the game queue rather than giving me actually teammates around my level."

apexlegends,fejgns4,t3_eph7wb,1579173363.0,In my experience when I soloQ (which I mostly do) compared to teaming up its the total opposite. Iâ€™m a player thatâ€™s had a high kd so every solo game I play the champion squad is a premade team consisting only of preds or high skill players.
apexlegends,feirhm0,t1_feipgov,1579145363.0,"I would prefer a full size body pillow, thank you."
apexlegends,fei5p00,t1_fei2y00,1579130850.0,Donâ€™t worry because youâ€™re still somehow teamed up with a level 20 bloodhound and mirage while the enemy team is a premade with 20kill badges and over 20000 kills

Season 2 pred and season 3 pred"
apexlegends,fecxrmh,t1_fect73a,1578988935.0,I think youâ€™re going about the whole pred thing wrong. I know a few players who are legit press from this season and last season and I gotta say their stats/badges arenâ€™t anything impressive but they do know how to keep high ground and survive early to late game
apexlegends,fecxinh,t3_eofnzt,1578988625.0,Youâ€™re basically asking to miss youâ€™re shots when you have a 2x scope on it
memes,fe6k2hy,t3_enw56v,1578893468.0,Thanks quite the claim suggesting I have friends
apexlegends,fe5x1x5,t1_fe5v8y6,1578876861.0,Looks like I was right. You actually didnâ€™t know that was the season 2 badge looks like I hit a nerve

apexlegends,fe5vbhq,t1_fe5udgr,1578875760.0,Trust me I know I had a wingman with no mag and a p2020 without the hop up he on the other hand had purple and a flatline
apexlegends,fe5uxrp,t1_fe5uqv6,1578875520.0,Burh lowkey 200iq for them zero for me lol
apexlegends,fe5u7p5,t1_fe5u02m,1578875044.0,"Dumbass thatâ€™s the badge you get for being a season 2 pred, dash boarding wasnâ€™t a thing back then.

I guess you wouldnâ€™t know huh?"
apexlegends,fe5u4nr,t1_fe5tti1,1578874990.0,Yeah youâ€™re right itâ€™s just I literally posted pics of my last couple of matches too and I couldnâ€™t help but post in frustration. Game after game Iâ€™m getting teammates that arenâ€™t as â€œgoodâ€ or just starting to play
apexlegends,fe5s74k,t1_fe5s3ym,1578873794.0,Iâ€™m actually being punished for being decent at a game like where do I turn to
apexlegends,fe5quht,t3_envsx1,1578873215.0,This is literally every game I play. I canâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m being punished for actually playing a game like wtf
apexlegends,fe4lu1r,t3_enso8j,1578860641.0,This has been in the game for a while now but devs be how devs be
apexlegends,fdnt2gk,t1_fdnqwz6,1578592269.0,Thanks
apexlegends,fdnid3o,t1_fdmdtqf,1578586431.0,Are you familiar with the terms of ranked and casual matches?
apexlegends,fdnhx26,t1_fdmjd9j,1578586165.0,They should add solos then
apexlegends,fdnex93,t3_em9gut,1578584350.0,They are not gonna ban players just probably penalize them
apexlegends,fdl43oe,t1_fdl3d1j,1578516712.0,Me too I canâ€™t tell what going on?
apexlegends,fdko334,t3_elwfoa,1578507599.0,If anyone was wondering why I was walking in front of the shotgun shots it was to block any damage to our lifeline as well
apexlegends,fdk45vt,t1_fdj6367,1578495616.0,He should because of smurf accounts. Plus I think that SBMM shouldnâ€™t be in casuals because that defeats the purpose of casuals. SBMM only works for games that had equal footing or a game that has at least other game modes.
apexlegends,fdiz4mg,t1_fdiy1lc,1578454389.0,Hate to be the squirter of betty booty blaps but I'm here to inform you that noone gives a bunk beat ass flapjack rats pussy hole bout what you think so why dont you just go fart inside a jelly roll crouscant type pastry and eat it n see if you feel better k?

apexlegends,fdfnwo8,t3_el53e4,1578366050.0,Nice
apexlegends,fdfkwy2,t1_fdfktmb,1578364089.0,I can see that
apexlegends,fdfkup3,t1_fdfkn0s,1578364049.0,I think that should be true for pubs but ranked is different
apexlegends,fdfkt57,t1_fdfknga,1578364022.0,I agree if it was PUBS but in ranked survival is key

cats,fd9opi9,t1_fd9m67l,1578236124.0,"I donâ€™t know what to do with her stuff now. Do I throw it away, keep it, or what."
cats,fd9o22r,t1_fd9m67l,1578235937.0,Thanks I appreciate it. She was my first pet. She loves sitting on my chair next me whenever I played my games. She always plays with the my sisters dog even heâ€™s a lot bigger than her. I mean she goes absolutely nuts over this one toy I got her.
cats,fd9kt4w,t3_ekd7yr,1578234750.0,My cat would always do that. Whenever I would sit down to play games she would always hop on my chair and just sleep there
cats,fd9jn03,t3_ekdktd,1578234249.0,I found her today and I thought she was just sleeping then I got closer and realized she wasnâ€™t breathing. I donâ€™t know what to do right now. Iâ€™m just crying and sad.
apexlegends,fcwmkqv,t3_ej8uth,1578029888.0,"How long did it take you to make this, it looks sick"
apexlegends,fcvboz1,t3_eizmwl,1577998739.0,I hate when randoms use the fact that youâ€™re a predator from last season against you. Unrelated topic kinda but randoms will call me shit for not 1v3 every squad when theyâ€™ve gone down like half the game. I constantly get attacked because Iâ€™m a predator and it seems like when every Iâ€™ve made a mistake the random will always use the whole â€œbut youâ€™re suppose to be a predatorâ€ line. It gets annoying because I wanna show the badge and trail but at the same time I donâ€™t want people to know.
apexlegends,fcv9z62,t3_ej2mju,1577997730.0,"So, how about solos?"
apexlegends,fcv9or2,t3_ej30cv,1577997558.0,I literally made the exact same post about this like a month ago

apexlegends,fclr8eo,t3_ehqhp3,1577754518.0,I think that smurfing shouldn't be allowed but in the case to prove a flaw in the system is something I can get behind. Sbmm shouldn't be implemented especially in pubs. I'll support what your doing as along as it's to info the player base

apexlegends,fcc5ig0,t1_fcc4m7x,1577594645.0,You wall jump by running at a surface at an angle then don't press any movement keys or buttons then you press the jump key/button

apexlegends,fc43lyk,t1_fc43hbu,1577405752.0,Or how about they add solos
apexlegends,fc43g30,t1_fc439l7,1577405626.0,Overreacting? I actually turned off my game because of this. This shouldn't be unpunished just like smurfing and having sbmm
apexlegends,fc43bce,t1_fc433x5,1577405526.0,What can I say in petty this game doesn't allow solos or any other game modes
apexlegends,fc43987,t3_eg3a3a,1577405481.0,"I was already in a bad mood to begin with because of work so I decided to play some apex my favorite game. Then as you could've imagined sbmm and just having shit teammates for couple games straight. I was already frustrated and just not having fun. This last game I was paired up with Dexia or whatever his name is and he wanted to play with his friends on the other team and decided to ruined my game and many others. How do I know this? I messaged him and he said he's done this plenty of times to play with his friends. At that point was done with it and this game. Please add solos back, it shouldn't be a ltm or special event. I miss having fun playing alex I really do"
apexlegends,fc3tclx,t3_eg1cjg,1577398118.0,Youâ€™re wrong in the sense of the poking damage you can do to someone. In rank you poke people with snipers to make them use all their heals for late game advantage. Plus the pro sense they do it too
apexlegends,fc3t5q0,t3_eg1i5f,1577397979.0,Exactly if theyâ€™re already dead then wait and try to regroup then fight. Thereâ€™s a time limit on the banner for a reason and a pretty lengthy one at that
