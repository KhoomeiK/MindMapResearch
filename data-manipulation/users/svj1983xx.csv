relationship_advice,fgsjfmo,t3_f08n80,1581085860.0,"Did they think about you when u were sleeping on the streets at 15??? Nope!!! That's crazy that a parent can do this to their own child. Then it took them 12 years to reach out to u... you could of been dead for all they knew! If it were me I would  begrudgenly send a letter or something saying ""sorry to hear your bad news"" or ""sorry but I dont talk to strangers"" and that's it. Let them take from that what they want and move forward with your life. They put their own happiness before yours now it's your turn. Good luck with whatever you decide to do or not do either way theres a lot of support here for you. Just remember THEY were the adults and u were a CHILD..."
