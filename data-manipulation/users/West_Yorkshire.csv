RocketLeagueSchool,ff62aqg,t3_erub7c,1579617331.0,"I wouldnt worry about what your true skill rating is. I sit comfortably at champ 2. I see people at this level who can ground dribble play me out the game but can't hit off the wall aerials. Champs aren't perfect in everything, that's why we are Champs. I'm good at defence and reading the opposing team, but I can't air dribble at all (I can ground dribble a bit).  If we were perfect at everything we would be at Pro level. Even GC's make mistakes sometimes.



Onto my next point, I feel like I play at the level my rank is it. Im C2 but if I drop to D3 I'll play worse than I would vs'ing C2. Maybe that has something to do with the inconsistency?"
