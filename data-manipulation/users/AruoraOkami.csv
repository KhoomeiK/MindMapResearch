lootcratespoilers,ffk26di,t1_ffjvvt6,1580013513.0,"I honestly only care about RWBY but their RWBY themed crate was such a disappointment...With only have ONE RWBY item in the whole crate when they've released other RWBY items before (  RWBY FIELD NOTE book and bookmark promo, RWBY tees and a hat) but only got a scythe figure Cresent Rose out of it.  Pretty disinterested now"
lootcratespoilers,ffjkyr3,t1_ffjk3zv,1580000623.0,"Or maybe they had like 10 crates available for this theme...  
Honestly, I just got Gear Anime crate and it sucked terribly. I am still waiting on Fallout Enegenizer crate (even though I am owed Scavenger that never came as well so chargebaaack it became) so my hopes are pretty low.  
Then the latest anime crate that came had 3 items in it! A death note lamp, Saski pencil case and Yume cup. Have seen someone who actually did get 4 items though"
creepyPMs,ffdy34y,t3_espvik,1579831793.0,Context please?
londonontario,ff7xdf4,t3_es5b8s,1579660609.0,"What I heard: No serious injuries maybe some smoke inhalation (Paramedics were being pretty lax at the scene)

About three units maybe more were affected by the fire

A person was there offering accommodations to the affected

At least one person was taken away for questioning  
Hope everyone is okay!!"
unpopularopinion,fehfr40,t3_eop98k,1579115618.0,"Just curious but would your opinion also apply to comments inciting violence against users/people, hate speech and other topics related to that?"
AmItheAsshole,fehfd44,t1_fegdlq2,1579115390.0,"Unfortunately, if OP lives in Canada, hair donations to the cancer society were [phased out as of December 31st, 2018](https://www.cancer.ca/en/get-involved/support-us/hair-donations/?region=qc) 

And even then there would be certain requirements to follow in order for the hair to be donated. No colouring, certain length, no dreadlocks, etc...

Honestly, collecting a certain amount of money to donate to the Cancer foundation in the name of assistant manager would be a lot more useful idea than hair donations that may or may not be used for wigs if applicable."

Switch,fdyzig4,t1_fdt1f8m,1578785176.0,"Nah, unfortunately, I only found this at a local game store and their policy is EVERYTHING that is sold new has to stay in it's new state or no refunds. No store credit either. It sucks.

Not really interested in BOTW stuff though....Wish other zeldas got more attention for switch accessories"

creepyPMs,fcsd44l,t1_fcrqd7h,1577914858.0,Exactly what I was thinking! It really sounded like he'd go after teenage girls under 18 if there were no laws stopping him (he probably is anyways but is careful to say it in text because that would be incriminating evidence....If the police cared to pursue him anyways)
creepyPMs,fcscgeq,t1_fcrhnv1,1577914601.0,10/10 would want as booty call lol. I bet the photos bring all the girls to the yard

Explain to agent everything that happened and hopefully they'll help you.  
If not, you could always do a chargeback with your CC company at the cost of being blacklisted on Ali."
