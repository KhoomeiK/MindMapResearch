aww,ffge87e,t1_ffgd3bh,1579904267.0,"Absolutley. Many, many factors come into play when considering how ecosystems work. The main point I was trying to make is that nature (generally) can give a shit about feelings/emotions of any given species. The main reason this trait of not wanting to eat the young is to protect their food source. You can't have a ""momma"" at all if species aren't able survive into adulthood. Of course, there are many slutions to this. A sprecies can have hundreds of babies at a time like many do. I have a biology degree from a top tier university which you are welcome to verify through my previous comments many years ago. I only felt compelled to give my input because of this and my interests"
aww,ffgb2m5,t1_ffg99ei,1579902322.0,You described a result of what I had written. I attempted to make it as simple as possible for the average redditor to understand. Eating mutltiple babies (instead of 1 adult) that will never get a chance to procreate will dramatically and quickly change the densities of ecosystems just as you had explained.
FortNiteMobile,ffg799i,t3_etg398,1579899973.0,Every update has only gotten worse for me as well. 2fps if I'm in a build fight on my android. 30fps was already difficult enough but reasonable and I was tolerating dropping below 20fps thanks to aim assist. Below 10fps is impossible.
FortNiteMobile,ffg6n57,t3_etaju2,1579899591.0,This is exactly what every game looks like for me too. I am stepping away from this game agaim as it's become unplayable. Hope to come back to a fixed game in the near future.
aww,ffg31hf,t1_ffg20q8,1579897377.0,I am aware that many do. You're missing the point/logic. Imagine if all mammals went for the easy kills of babies. Species would go extinct  faster than you realize and the ecosystem would constantly be changing until it no longer existed. The reason why it's predominantly mammals and other animals mentioned is because of their intelligence. They are capable of distinguishing the difference between a juvenile and adult and this trait has become selected. This is also the same principle behind deer hunting and what you are/are not allowed to shoot in the US.
aww,ffg1ir5,t1_ffg0zez,1579896435.0,It makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint. Eating/harming defenseless babies would mean no future generations or food for the predators.
Unexpected,ffeop6i,t1_ffemo20,1579857727.0,"I completely understand what you are saying and wasn't trying to disagree with you about that. But when the majority of Muslims in the world choose to ignore this ""rule"", or are not aware of it, it's simply not a defining, religious belief. It's the culture of the people in the area and as I mentioned before, not just the Muslims in the area that practice it."

BuyItForLife,ffeh61o,t1_ffegnml,1579847836.0,"You're completely missing my point and the point of this subreddit. After a couple years of your ""lifetime"" service, report back. I'd be willing to bet you that $40 that this company nobody has heard of will still be around."
BuyItForLife,ffegewx,t3_et6cia,1579847004.0,Services like this often only last as long as the company does before they change their names. You may very well get what you paid for and way more (compared to other services) but there's no guarantee they wont shut down and keep your money tomorrow.
malefashionadvice,ffee1z8,t3_esuah3,1579844567.0,My Doc Martin's I begged to get in the 7th grade when they were all the rage. I'm now 35 years old. I've been wearing them regularly this year again. https://imgur.com/O0RWCng
Unexpected,ffeawdu,t1_ffe9zoo,1579841624.0,"I guess what I was trying to say is that it's not ""Islam"" in general. Some people who share this belief use their religion to defend this idea just like many other crazy beliefs. My parents are both middle-eastern and Christian and had the same mentality towards dogs even after living in the US for decades because of where they were raised. Similarly, people use Christianity to hate on gays and can base it off random scripture they've found while other Christians welcome homosexuals into their churches. In my opinion, people use their religion to justify their individual/culture's crazy notions without scientific basis. Islamic scripture never said anything about women driving cars but in some parts of the world, they can't because of ""religion"". Its not like any of Mohammed's wives (even the ones old enough to drive!) knew what a car was."
Unexpected,ffe9792,t1_ffe8rw5,1579840166.0,I think it's a regional thing more than it is religious. It just so happens to be that the regions where this mentality stems from is predominantly Muslim. I've met several Muslim families that don't accept dogs as pets (but love cats!) while other Muslim families have dogs as pets.
politics,ffcw5vn,t3_estvix,1579808523.0,"It's almost as if this whole trial is a sham and they already know the verdict. What's the difference between this trial and those in Middle-eastern countries where the judges already make decisions before the trial begins? (I'm middle-eastern and my parents have explained the court systems from their native lands) Hint - the difference is that millions more people will be affected by this outcome and millions more in the future generations. More quickly than slowly, people are losing their rights and life of the average American will become increasingly difficult as the few rich families than run this nation take over."
politics,ffavyjx,t1_ffaezdq,1579745751.0,Exactly. Don't want to hear both sides? You no longer have a voice.
