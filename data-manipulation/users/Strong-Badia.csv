I don’t know that I could ever support a collectivist ideology since, in that case, I’d have to not just abandon my ideas, but also those values.

There‘s nothing wrong with ”money making schemes”, aka businesses. They incentivize innovation and result in more research and development in the US than any other country. Because there is more incentive to create better drugs... to get money... The bulk of the profits are made in America and then foreign markets are just an afterthought. So, I hope you realize that the only reason you can have price fixing at the rates you do is because the American populace effectively subsidizes the costs of your medicine *and* research. You‘re welcome.

Honestly, your distaste for business and profit driven endeavors is quite concerning. They give us computers, cars, clothes, whatever. These “schemes” and their constant innovation are the reason that even many poor people today can afford a smartphone, a device that can access all of recorded knowledge. Let’s allow the market to do that for medicine, yeah? In fact, the market *is* doing that here for elective surgeries and procedures, where the government isn’t involved. They are becoming cheap as hell as people have to undercut prices while offering a service people still want to pay for.

So, no I don’t think they will end it voluntarily. Nor do they need to. Don’t get me wrong, there’s plenty of bullshit in the American healthcare system that should be fixed, most of it a result of pharmaceutical cronyism and unproductive patents or regulation that keep prices super inflated. So again, the fact that your suggestion hasn’t been discovered through voluntary means should tell you something about its viability. Or do you actually think everybody besides the government is so stupid that they wouldn’t figure out an effective insurance system.

Those are interpretations applied by humans. Humans which do not and could not begin to understand the will of God (God, the Tao, the universe, whatever you please). The assumption that God would or could prevent these things is based off the premise that you know the will of God; you don’t.

Now, what religion *does* tell us is how to best conduct ourselves for our own and other’s best interest. The claim that it’s first and foremost tool for control is mistaken. I’m guessing you haven’t *practiced* in any pure sense any of the major religions. There’s very little in any of the core morals that would be opposed to even from a secular perspective. Let’s just take Christianity for example. I mean, if everybody was Christ-like (which is the explicit goal of Christianity) we’d have achieved heaven, which is basically what it promises to those who follow.

And, yes, people have used religion for control. In the same way people have used literally anything for control. Ironically, if those tyrants were actually following the teachings, they wouldn’t do that which kind of invalidates the notion that religion is created for the purpose of controlling people. It‘s been *used* to control people. It’s *created* for the purpose of sustaining people and societies.

For example, the original comment getting downvoted for suggesting data be looked at while not even endorsing it. We tend to operate from an “all else being equal” mindset but that‘s almost never the case, at least not 100%. Because, for example, while price floors don’t *always* and in all circumstances result in lower employment, there are myriad other manifestations that should be considered. But we’d only bother to consider those other manifestations after being presented with those results. Perhaps this study is one so poorly designed that it should be shrugged off, I hadn’t taken a good look at it yet (and probably don’t have the economic chops anyway to give a proper dismissal) but seeing the take of “hey, let’s check out the data” being downvoted just didn’t sit well with me.

Maybe it isn’t and we’d have to assess what are the unseen costs. The world doesn’t play out any theory with 100% accuracy.

Regardless, I still don’t necessarily think that it’s appropriate to use the force of the state to address the suicide “epidemic” as it‘s often referred to as.

Second, I am skeptical of how safe it truly is. I’m not necessarily suggesting it isn’t... but who could really say as of now. It takes time to empirically observe what consequences, if any, would be associated. I prefer not to be the guinea pig.

Lastly, and most important, I don’t think it makes any sense when there are near infinite alternative foods. Meat consumption is not necessary, and there are plenty of other foods that don’t need to be created in a lab and don’t cost nearly as much.

this is a joke btw. I actually don’t know."
Shitstatistssay,fcp5eku,t1_fcp0drj,1577851025.0,"Sorry man. That’s a shitty thing to do and the only thing you can do is make sure you don’t do this yourself. I think it’s crazy how people can shit on each other for having different beliefs. That‘s the issue with politics; either impose your beliefs on somebody else or have them imposed on you. so Instead of just simply having different beliefs, people are made to see each other as opponents who will enforce their ideals over them if they don’t fight back. It makes me very sad. And the more aspects of life that get introduced into politics, the more reason people have to fight each other."

Libertarian,fcns38s,t1_fclpn5k,1577817357.0,"None of those things actually matter. Not compared to starving 500,000 children from sanctions, drone bombing innocent people, torturing prisoners, you know, previous administrations actions to actually be appalled by if you believe in liberty. Obviously Trump has a bad record in the war arena too, but it isn’t uniquely bad. In fact, it’s arguably marginally better but that really isn’t saying much and is hardly worth praise if any."
Shitstatistssay,fcnpisy,t1_fcnmxl5,1577815992.0,"It’s certainly not gained through voting.

Not in any practical sense anyways. I’m not even entirely opposed to voting or political means. I’m just saying, whatever your cause is, voting is a less than half-assed, virtually insignificant gesture. And yes, you could be involved in the process locally or vote third party but OPs post is about people engrossed in the more general R vs D. Voting between the two mainstream approved people who were able to play the politics game best is hardly going to do anything for real world results, let alone freedom. To then feel a sense of virtue for that is, in my opinion, asinine."
Shitstatistssay,fcnlwpr,t3_ei442n,1577814002.0,"I fucking despise the notion that voting a certain policy or candidate carries any virtue. Like, you fucking put a check mark on a piece of paper then go home and shame people who put their check mark in a different place and somehow feel good about yourself afterwards. I wish it was that easy for me to feel good about myself. And I’m not saying that there isn’t a degree of ethics in politics, I’m saying that *having* a set of ethics and *acting* on them are two extremely different things that get tragically conflated in politics. Voting isn’t action. You care about the less fortunate? That’s legitimately admirable. Now go do something about it other than vote for some power seeking con artist. Or, hell, still vote for the con artist but then actually go volunteer at your local homeless shelter afterwards. Politics is such a crutch for good when people think they are making a difference by participating the voting ritual every few years and get to feel like they did something."

Shitstatistssay,fcbe22n,t1_fcb7zwb,1577585724.0,"That’s fair enough, though I would argue they are more than just that but it’s largely semantics. Still, ultimately even mutually assured rights don’t require the state."
Shitstatistssay,fcb6xce,t1_fcauw1g,1577583151.0,If the government determines I have the right to your home is that just? If I have the right to your labor and you are now a slave is that just? Would you be in the wrong for defending yourself in these scenarios? Of course not. You would fight against it as anybody would and you would be justified. Well how’s that? The state determined you did or did not have a right to do so. So then why would you feel infringed upon if your rights come from the state. It’s because your rights obviously exist outside any state. They come from virtue of being a sovereign individual.
Shitstatistssay,fcainq0,t3_egvu0o,1577569898.0,The answer is yes.
Shitstatistssay,fca8hwo,t3_egvc1m,1577564680.0,I’m all for individual choice and I don’t think anybody should be forced to do this but antivax is a bad look for the liberty movement.
