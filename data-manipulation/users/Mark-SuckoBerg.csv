RedPillWomen,fenjvsn,t3_epp27u,1579286265.0,"Hey I’m a male here, i’m in this community because I want to understand better the problems women face everyday by either society or personal. 

Let me tell you a story. There was a girl I knew when I was in gr 9 freshman high-school. She was gr 10(15-16) I think she liked me or something but she would always act weird around me. But she had alot of masculine attributes. She had broad shoulders, she was very rough, she was explosive, flat chest, she would be rude, she had very rough hands compared to the guys our age and pretty much a masculine attribute. I was always nice to this girl a little bit because she scared me lol but mostly because I could tell that deep down she was nervous about who she was and would act out in order to not make herself seem vulnerable or weak.

I moved out of two in gr 11 and didn’t see her anymore till I was in college. She sent me a request on ig and HOLLLLYYY did she change, the difference is night and day. She’s an absolute stunning woman, it seems that she hit puberty a little bit later and also looking back at it now, she looked feminine to us because most of us hadn’t even hit puberty. What we thought were our broad manly shoulders, were actually tiny children like shoulders. Even when I see highschool kids now all I see is kids. So it makes sense. Relative to us who hadn’t hit puberty, this girl who also hadn’t hit puberty was masculine. But us relative to grown men were feminine lol.

But back to the girl, what I notice now vs before is that she began to take care of herself more. She wasn’t ashamed to put on make up, paint her nails and embrace her feminine side. But the biggest thing of all is that she seems more confident about herself. She even opened up her own company for embracing young Women of colour and their beauty. She makes a lot of money doing what she loves and in a way I think giving girls what she deprived of herself. She is very feminine in her tone now and very nice the way she addresses people. She still her confident outspoke self but embraces it. 

What i’m getting at is that you’re still young, most of the guys your age haven’t hit puberty and you have alot of time to work on yourself. The biggest thing about working on yourself is not starting with the gym, doing this and doing that. The biggest thing is having hope for the future and patience with yourself. And that includes not looking at other and being jealous on what you have and what you don’t. realize that it’s okay to be yourself, it’s ok if you’re lacking something and then realize that whatever it is you can work on it and figure it out. Not with complaining, frustration, stress, and panic. But with patience, love, Tranquility, and understanding for yourself. Your confidence is like the Chinese finger trap, when you see that you’re stuck you panic and struggle to get out, and you try soo hard and you get so frustrated because you believe you will never get out, and you become sad because you see others getting out and you wish that if you could be like them and have what they have then you would figure out a way. 

Now eventually you will either keep struggling and stressing or accept it and calm down. It’s okay to pick any, because any of them will shape you into a more understanding person. But you already tried struggling. Why not try being calm instead and accepting? And once you calm down you realize that the way out is not by fighting it but by accepting it and bringing your fingers closer and then you’re out. Confidence and self love works the same way. Once you have patience, love and understanding for yourself. You have the same for everything else, and then you’ll have the patience to go to the gym and work on yourself :) 

I’ll leave you a quote from “the alchemist” a book I think you should read: https://paulocoelhoblog.com/2013/02/09/the-two-drops-of-oil-2/

Best of luck on your journey to self improvement! Remember after to go to the gym, take care of your health and focus on learning."

AskReddit,fei0ebd,t3_ep3dfc,1579127568.0,"Helping somebody open up a dealership, I was so proud of myself and I thought At 18 I was on my way on becoming very successful. Later I found out he really just needed me for the bitch work and once the dealership was all set up my partner tossed me aside. I don’t regret the lessons I learnt but I do regret how proud I became. Like full of pride. After all, all my other friends didn’t have a job and just stayed around their house smoking pot all day.

I became prideful because I thought I was better than them in a way, I thought I was so smart, I thought I was destined for something. Then my relationship with my partner started to fall apart and being an 18 year old I thought no matter where I went I could always get a lucky hit (I thought this because I was literally doing so well in everything, job, women, everything) everywhere I went something always seem to pop up for me. The problem is that prior to the dealership I didn’t do thing out of malice, I did things because I was curious, I loved hanging out with people, I loved learning and seeing things I did grow, and this gave me a confidence that I could take on anything. But after the dealership a malice had grown inside of me that at first I didn’t understand. My entire world became money, I didn’t want to do anything unless I got something out of it, I no longer cared about the women I would talk to and would literally just talk to them for sex, and I’ve started scamming alot of my friends. Overall I became a very nasty, selfish, vulgar and malicious person. Once that happened I couldn’t focus on one thing because I wouldn’t do things with passion or love anymore, then things started to go down hill. I went back to college because I was no longer secure of my future. Unfortunately due to some events I had to drop out. Once that happened I wasn’t getting opportunities, girls stopped talking to me, most friends cut me off, and I lost my confidence. After that I couldn’t speak to people. I became depressed. I would literally cry myself to sleep every night. I gained 40 pounds. On top of that to make thing worst 2 of my grandparents died during that period, my father lost his job. So there I was a chubby 20 year old, alone in his room, without a job, without an education, and would do drugs just to stop thinking about how sad I was. 

It’s funny because before all of this happened I used to despise people that were like that. I never understood depression, or low self-esteem. I had literally became everything I was not and disliked. From my 20’s I spent that year spiteful, spiteful at myself, spiteful at women, spiteful at friends who I thought abandoned me, and all I could think about is how I was going to be the best again and never talk to them (had not learn my lesson).  But this didn’t happen, I saw everyone around me began to grow as a person, they had good jobs, about to finish school, girls I used get into loving relationships, and there was me literally not doing anything with his life (I started college again , my first year when everyone my age was on their 3rd). And this honestly started to break me, emotionally I really gave up and I thought there was no hope for me, that I had screwed up the one and only chance I had and everything I had to give to the world was already given by 18 year old me and I didn’t get better than that. This was early 2019’s. 

So at this stage, I had no motivation for anything. My room was messy, because I thought there was no point on cleaning it, I didn’t study, talk to people, talk to girls, or anything because I didn’t think there was a point. Then I saw my best friend from childhood and I saw how well his life was going, he used to be obese but now he’s fit, he used to have no confidence now he has alot of confidence and he’s doing so well. It broke my heart when he told me that he used to look up to me because I was caring, outgoing, popular, etc. It broke my heart because all I could think about is “what happened to me?”. Then I got in touch with my other friend from high-school and the same thing, he’s doing much better and told me the same thing. That he used to look up to me. And this one hurt me as-well. All of 2019 I spent in borderline depression, had bad self-harming thoughts and had no hope. Then finally December 15 came along, I got together with another long time friend, now this friend we had been very close when I was 18 and successful. I remember he was very self conscious, stayed in his room all day, and smoked alot. I would always give him advice and motivate him during that time and we had not seen each other from my 19th - 21st. Then I saw him again and he has improved so much! He is now confident and outgoing. Before we said good bye he thanked me and said that I had helped him so much. This broke me again and I told him about my situation. Then he began giving me advice telling me that he was in that situation when I was 18 and I helped him get out of it. Then the conversation we had gave me so much hope. I had a hard look at myself in the mirror and saw everything I was doing wrong. How I wasn’t doing things out of love, how I was hanging on to the past, how I was just upset because I was so hung on an idea of a person I thought I was. 

What I learnt was that, it’s okay that things didn’t work out. I never did them to become rich or be better than others. I did them because I truly interested and passionate about those things. I then began to realize that a-lot of things I was currently doing, I was doing to have some sense of pride, not because I liked doing them. I remembered I liked being clean not because It made me better but because I liked how I was able to make things look so cool and modern. I liked working out because I liked how my body looked. I liked learning because I learnt something new. Most importantly I re-kindled that love I have for talking to people. I like making people laugh, making people feel good, and feeling good with them. And this meant wasn’t putting myself ahead of them. I then saw my ego and how much it was hurting me and how I wasn’t doing thing truly for me, but because I thought how others would see me. I realize that all of this time I have not been myself and that’s what I disliked about me. most importantly I see now that everything is a process and we need little steps to get there and I need  to have patiences for myself and others. I also see that I want to be happy and want to have a meaningful life. And I can do it, I just have to let go of the past and whatever notion Of what I think I am, and see myself truly for what I am. Call it cringe but I started this year really well and find myself happy. I think I finally came to terms with myself and i’m ready to move on. Not by pretending that things didn’t happen but by accepting and embracing that they did. From the 25th of December till now I have been truly happy and feel confident in the future :) 

So, my biggest regret. It’s my pride. 

TL;DR: Regret being prideful."

AskReddit,fdpep4l,t3_emkv4b,1578626706.0,"Not sure if it exist but potentially yes that is 100% possible not as good as it is for faces. The reason it works pretty well for faces it’s because it’s selecting the most important parts of your face (nose,eyes,mouth,etc) and tries to link it with a facemap. With a body it’s different though, there are wayy too many important parts to highlight that a regular cellphone will have a hard time processing. Then you will reduce those important points and the body altering will look really weirdly. Then you have to take into considerations things such as, what happens if a hand goes over someones body or behind? A regular cellphone doesn’t have 3d censors so how will it keep track of that? With faces it works well because the important parts have a defined set of movements, hence if you put your hand over it or move you face in weird angles the filter stays at that spot. With bodies it’s the same thing if your filter will just make your body look like it’s behind a cardboard cut-out then might aswell crop your face over a picture and call it a day. 

The next best thing is actually just getting your face detected and the computer crops it over a 3d model of a body. Like snapchat does."
