aww,ffvls18,t3_evgcyg,1580267121.0,Love the Danes! I've had them 27 years now. I have a 10 year old harlequin girl and a 7.5 year old deaf fawnequin girl. There is no love like the love of a Dane. Or two. Or five : )
atheism,ffvkg8o,t3_evgg3u,1580266221.0,Because God doesn't believe in me.
aww,ffvk9p1,t3_evggqu,1580266100.0,"What a cute kitty! I have a Great Dane who was deaf from birth. She is almost 8 years old and I taught her using hand signals. Deaf pets are the best but when I first got her it took me a while to get used to it. I came into the house, slam the door with my hands full of whatever, and she'd still be snoozing away. I can't tell you how many times I was so scared and thought she was dead! I had to remind myself she just didn't hear me come in. I keep a night light on always so she isn't afraid. It helps because she seems to be scared of the dark."
PoliticalHumor,ffv27b8,t3_evdif3,1580253978.0,"Trump blocked subpoenas, refused testimony, and hid evidence. Then Trump said he could refuse all attempts at getting information under ""executive privilege."" The Senate, composed of majority Republicans, have every reason to continue to hide any evidence of wrongdoing. Republicans exposing a corrupt Republican president as corrupt would open up a Pandora's box they can't recover from. But continuing this blatant cover up is far worse."
aww,ffroalq,t1_ffq92hc,1580162194.0,"I give her ""the look."" That's all that is required : )"
aww,ffrdw1a,t1_ffqwe2b,1580156078.0,I have kept her on a controlled diet since her spay 7 years ago and walks twice a week to keep her from gaining weight. She stays trim at 140 pounds.
aww,ffqfoyq,t1_ffqfllj,1580133225.0,She comes from a line of long lived Danes : ) Her dad is creaky but still alive and well. He is 12.
aww,ffqe0rd,t1_ffqdzhn,1580131746.0,Lol. You're probably right there!
aww,ffqdwsb,t1_ffqdacn,1580131647.0,She is! Danes are easy keepers. They actually make good apartment dogs.
aww,ffq9zfw,t1_ffpp73l,1580127654.0,She is!
worldpolitics,ffnk06h,t3_eu46aj,1580066981.0,"What, he hasn't proposed cutting minimum wage yet? I'm shocked."
politics,ffgyffs,t3_etkiiq,1579918277.0,Doesn't matter how strong the case is that the Democrats present. Vladimir Zelensky himself could testify that Trump held a gun to his head to get him to conduct the investigation into Biden. Nothing will make any difference. There is none so blind as they who will not see.
worldpolitics,fff2pur,t3_et1hcq,1579874098.0,"She's right. Life isn't fair. If it was, Trump wouldn't get away with obstructing Congress."
worldpolitics,ff8w57d,t3_es71gj,1579698075.0,"This isn't a ""trial."" Calling it a trial implies the process is impartial. Heads Trump wins, tails Trump wins. It's just another Trump rally with Mitch Mc Connell as the star."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fekjutm,t3_epl7kd,1579201561.0,"Don't get me started on the ridiculous requirements of rescues. If she can't be rescued locally, bend the rules and rescue out of town! Or just change the rules altogether! It's not good for dogs to sit and sit without a home. WTF?! Then they complain about dogs languishing forever in their rescue when many loving families get rejected for stupid reasons. I swear much of the time it's just a martyrdom power trip with these people."
travel,fehqzx2,t1_fehe24c,1579122141.0,"I'm not sure what the cost difference is. This is a Delta flight, operating under Air France. I'll check."
travel,fehfjgz,t1_fegspeh,1579115493.0,Oh the irony-charging passengers extra for saving fellow humans' lives if the airline fucks up and the plane falls from the sky in a fiery inferno.
travel,fehc18h,t1_feh2xzh,1579113459.0,"Seriously? I have read about weirdos who actually prefer the middle seat. Never have met such a creature, though."
travel,fegs48w,t1_fegrqxx,1579101253.0,Haha! You crack me up! And it's very helpful. Thank you for this.
travel,fegp3vw,t1_fegp0aj,1579099184.0,Eat her food. Haha. Love it!
travel,fegoj8s,t1_fego54d,1579098776.0,Thanks! I love talking to her but I don't want her jet lagged either. We can change seats when we get tired.
travel,fegohhs,t1_fegobr3,1579098741.0,"I just thought about that. Us being separated doubles the chance that we'd sit next to a jerk/someone who has a boatload of screaming children/stinky/ etc. . . And that would really suck on a 10 hour flight! EDIT: We're a same sex couple, so the protection thing really isn't a factor lol."
PoliticalDiscussion,febo0sy,t3_eo7wc4,1578960904.0,How will Cory Booker dropping out affect the rest of the primary? It won't affect it at all. That's why he dropped out.
politics,fdpil6q,t3_emig3q,1578629602.0,A slap on the wrist after the fact. Like that will stop the Psychopath-in-Chief from doing anything.
politics,fd2grco,t3_ejlvdw,1578146989.0,Like it matters. Trump has become a demagogue. He does what he wants whether or not Congress approves it. And the dumbass Republicans continue to defend his actions anyway. Congress is indirectly saying their jobs are useless but they are too stupid to understand that. What a bunch of toadies. Do they even have a single independent thought at all anymore or is everything about bowing to the orange one? It's pathetic.
books,fck1u1g,t3_ehjskk,1577714015.0,Katherine of Aragon by Alison Weir. I am a big true history reader and have recently picked up historical fiction. I enjoy it because it adds excitement to history. I like Alison Weir. She writes fiction and nonfiction. Her perspective on the female characters seems realistic to me and she doesn't insert too much romance.
