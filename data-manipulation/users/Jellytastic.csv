WIC and foodstamps and unemployment and other forms are welfare are not what they should be. That does not mean that jobs are slavery. Unlike a slave, you can:

\-Pursue almost any career you want. You are not guaranteed that career, but I'm not sure what system would offer that.

\-Choose where to live.

\-Negotiate terms with your boss, or leave a job whenever you want.

You are not guaranteed a simple and comfortable life. I agree with you that bosses have an immense advantage over the working class, and that is bad. That does not mean it's the same as slavery. 

The reason you think it is is because you've bought into the same kinds of lies. You think you will die without job security. You think you have to do whatever your boss says.
