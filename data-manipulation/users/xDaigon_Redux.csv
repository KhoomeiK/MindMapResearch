facepalm,ffasfyc,t1_ffap41i,1579743423.0,"I love your answer, but from that explanation it's not like the movie Dogma. In Dogma, God cant intervene in what's going on due to the fact that he often would take the form of an elderly man and play Skee-ball on the pier because he was a huge fan of the game. At the beginning of the movie a trio of demon children beat the tar outta him and put him in a coma so that God cant return to Heaven to prevent the story from happening. So, in that case, it was literally God himself(herself in the movie sort of) in human form."

I get that you cant do the Nazi thing in Germany, and that does make sense to me, but, in theory, this dude could just like to rock the look. He could be a fan of Charlie Chaplin, or just really think this style is awesome. So, if he isnt inciting any actual problems, why would the police officer or he himself get in any trouble.
