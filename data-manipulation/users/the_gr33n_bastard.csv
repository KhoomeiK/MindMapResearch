Absolutely not. If we were as bad as the guy in the video we would be asking you why you didn't stay in church. 

Christianity has been used to justify slavery so the connection there is clear, and like I said, it's more likely that he is Christian than anything else as it is the single biggest denomination in the US. I would go so far as to say that were he an atheist or humanist he would be the opposite of the racist he is. This is a place to share opinions and if we can share opinions about someone's shitty racism we can share opinions of someone's shitty religion. Just to be clear Christianity in all its forms is a shitty religion which I personally liken to things like racism in its divorcement from reality.
