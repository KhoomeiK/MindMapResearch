Documentaries,feggzon,t3_ep0lat,1579092451.0,"By all nature and design, almost any 'news organization' will have some sort of bias. Most folks agree that Reuters, BBC and, to some degree, NPR have less bias, but they all exist at the behest of external funding. Local public TV stations seem to exist as the least political broadcasters of all - because they present no news whatsoever. But if you've read it on Facebook or Google or any other aggregator, it's because of promotion, and that means money - even if it's just a simple NYT article, the promotion is in the billions of dollars and hundreds of years they've spent building that 'trusted' platform.

When you look at the Google News feed, they have started noting ""Opinion"" under the leads of top articles - and nearly half the posts are labeled so. I've noted headlines over the years drifting from ""President has Conference in China"" (Nixon) to ""Bill Clinton Peddles Reagonomics 2.0 to China"" to ""Drumpf Avoids Impeachment Fire By Selling Out to Chinese Overlords"". No one reads the stories - they skim the headlines, on the way to the makeup tutorials. But the only reason you're seeing any particular piece of content is not because it has a basis in fact, but because it's where the money goes - if the preponderance of news consumers are idiots, the news providers will pander to idiocy. If you're reading this <*pats self on back*\>, you're probably not part of the problem. Or maybe we collectively don't believe our slide toward the intellectual middle is a problem at all. Why not have some post-modern fun and mix our lifestyle choices with our critical thinking skills?

My point is that people don't really want the old Walter Cronkite-style of flat fact-reporting news, though they say they do; so much is going on that we fairly rely on external interpretation, and that means opinions. We have to allow them all, read them all, and make our choices. We need clear labeling and more education on corporate bias. Personally, I don't see how anyone could think ""Apple News"" (as one example) is going to provide the same newsfeed as ""Google News"" - if you believe a certain way and you pick a certain global platform as a result of that belief system, that could be a problem.

Food cultures in other countries date back many, many centuries, compared to foods we eat that are unchanged from when they arrived just a hundred and fifty years ago."
todayilearned,fdqa4ft,t1_fdq6vyh,1578660822.0,"I agree that labeling, itself, is the culprit. But it's also part of our marketing-driven culture. What is Gatorade? We call it a sports drink but the top-line sports drinks have almost as much sugar as the 'soft drinks' - only called 'soft' because they aren't 'hard liquor', but much better marketing than something called 'sugar drinks'.
I agree that Taco Bell is so far from authentic Mexican that to even use that word is fairly offensive, even if unintended by moms and kids who just like tacos. But for those same simple people, they have to identify it somehow, and fast food consumers, in this case, like to think they are alternating wildly between choices like seafood, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Italian and ""plain old American"" like hamburgers or steak when, in fact, the restaurants they choose are likely owned by the same corporation and get their product from the same Sysco food truck.

So I would add one more solution to your choices: Consumer Self-Selection in the Economy of Attention. It's the easiest way for companies to sort their customers into buckets. If you can come up with a better way that's less culturally offensive, you have a career as a highly-paid marketing consultant."
todayilearned,fdq9ky9,t1_fdq6w2m,1578660302.0,I've tried a number of curries. I work in IT. I'm surrounded by curry. They all tasted like curry and now I know what curry tastes like.

I've read the history books and I believe they mentioned something about the British Empire having once colonized (colonised) most of the known world. Once or twice. And I've already noted how we Americans have, by necessity, had to appropriate nearly all of our 'native' foods. But wouldn't it seem funny to a non-American if they saw Joe Six-Pack sit down to watch America's Got Talent saying ""I love me some American grub!"" whilst eating enchiladas and grocery-store sushi rolls?

If a Brit came to the US and said ""hey, let's go have some great American food"", he just might be taken to a Taco Bell or PF Chang's. What is American food? Because the menu items at those two places are definitely NOT Mexican or Chinese - they're 100% American.

So when someone says ""British food"", I think fish and chips or blood pudding - I don't think of the spices of India and the orange goop that masks the taste of everything it covers. Yet the food that seemingly defines Britain is chicken tikka masala. Personally, whenever I'm within hundreds of feet of curry, I retch. It overpowers everything in the kitchen. But I'm sure it's quite tasty and, after you've been culturally exposed to it, it's just like the fake spices that waft through our ""Mexican"" restaurants."

Is the contention that women are weak and unable to act on their own volition, that they don't have the same sexual agency as men because of their genetic makeup? (even though we have all agreed that the idea of male and female genders is a fictional construct).  What about transsexual prostitutes?

Documentaries,fdniau9,t3_em3m49,1578586393.0,"It will be interesting to see how intersectional identity politics and liberalism will approach the question of sex work in the next few decades. Does a woman have the right to do anything with her body that she wishes? How do we distinguish between people who do sex work of their own volition vs. those who are coerced? Is sex so immoral and disgusting that we need to police the actions of everyone, at home and in public, to make sure they are only having sex with the 'correct' people?

Look at the disparity: The US says sex work is almost entirely illegal. UK and Canada are slightly softer, but only a little, while Australia is pretty much open season - and those are 3 closely-related Western countries. Do we need different rules for the East and West, reinforcing the idea that there are ""predator"" and ""prey"" races?
