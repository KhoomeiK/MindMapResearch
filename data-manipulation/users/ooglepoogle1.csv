wholesomememes,fen5ebf,t1_fen4rz2,1579277352.0,Do this one thing for me real fast. Look up “minority college scholarship” and tell me what you see. There’s an equal amount of scholarship dollars set out for black people as there are all other races and scholarships combined in the US. Jobs are denying qualified candidates because they want to look like they have more ethnic diversity. That argument might sound bigoted at first but my real argument is that race should mean absolutely nothing in this day and age and that it shouldn’t be looked at twice. We focus on the past so much for no reason.
wholesomememes,fen4kzo,t1_fen419d,1579276833.0,"It would have set a precedent because he is THE Kendrick Lamar and anything he does sets precedent because he and other extremely famous artists such as drake sit on a publicized throne and everything they do will be analyzed thoroughly. So I should be mad at white people too because my Irish ancestors were practically slaves too? I know it’s a much smaller scale but things will never improve if we focus on the past. It’s 2020, people are all equally trash so why act like any trash is better than others?"
wholesomememes,fen3e30,t1_fen31t3,1579276084.0,"As I said, it’s not magically going away but it’s a step in the right direction, and he could have set a precedent like I said earlier by ignoring it and giving off the idea that music is an art that should be enjoyed by everyone. Don’t bait a fan then ruin their life when they take it is all I’m saying. That poor girl got swept up in the moment he gave her and now she will never be forgotten by the internet."
wholesomememes,fen2rwc,t1_fen2b39,1579275694.0,"Regardless of the number of times it’s been performed, that young girl got ridiculed by thousands of people over a damn word in a song. I don’t think it will magically remove the race gap but I do think the moment when people realize words are nothing more than words, the world will become an easier place to live in. People shouldn’t have to worry about which words they can or cannot say, especially when in front of thousands of people singing an explicit song."
wholesomememes,fen1evb,t1_fen0xsd,1579274816.0,"People in that position with the fame that he has, have the opportunity to get rid of the stigma surrounding that word and to get rid of the gap between races, but instead he fed the flame. Sure she probably shouldn’t have said it, but she shouldn’t have been asked to sing a song where she would have to awkwardly stare at the audience every 7th word either. In the end, social reform and racial gaps will never die because no one will try to bridge the gap."
wholesomememes,fen0sio,t1_femanyn,1579274414.0,I replied to the other guy who had a garbage comment like yours. Not explaining myself twice.
wholesomememes,fen0pje,t1_fem870j,1579274360.0,"It was his opportunity to set a precedent that music is music. Words are just words. Its 2020, imagine if white people had music that had words in it other races couldn’t say. The world would burn. At first she didn’t say the word but it sounded really awkward because it’s emphasized in that portion of the song, and she got excited being on stage so he publicly humiliated her. He could have chose a song that didn’t have that word 50+ times."
