I actually went to the Austin Live Show, but the tickets were just on the edge of what I could afford (student&part timer), so I couldn't actually get anything from the shop, only look on. The show was one of the funniest content I've ever seen from CR, and I have no regrets about going! Everyone was so over the top, it was hilarious to see Sam being the most *""rational""* character of them all. 

I'd love to have it, but I'm sure a lot of people do too!"

I'm currently digging some younger bands like the Longest Johns and the Dreadnoughts! More spry, and still actually *writing* shanty songs. There are some oldies and goodies hanging around my lists (Stan Rogers has one or two that fit the bill really well) but I'd have to go and look more of them up.
