AskReddit,fdll8aj,t3_elssvy,1578526543.0,"I used to think that all married couples had to be born in the same country, and have the same first and last initials. my mother is venezuelan and was born there, my dad was also born there but he has no connection to it. their initals are both MB so i naturally assumed that all married couples were like this."

AskReddit,fccn27a,t3_egwusn,1577600303.0,"I lost my dad at 11, so the grieving process for me was pretty much experienced through what my mum and siblings were feeling. after my dad’s death, we got hundreds, i mean HUNDREDS of cards & letters from people all around the world who knew him. we knew he had travelled a lot, but was unaware of the impact he had on them. some of them were lovely- they were long messages on how they knew my dad and how long since he’d seen them etc, and we really appreciated the heartwarming stories that those strangers told us. however some just said “he’s in a better place” and “one day you’ll see him in heaven”. we understood why people said that, but surely no place is better than being alive, with your family? we didn’t want to see him “one day”, we wanted to see him now! 

moral of the story: don’t try to comfort the person with your beliefs & things that can’t be proven. happy stories are appreciated, and i still love hearing them and talking to other people about my wonderful dad because of it"
