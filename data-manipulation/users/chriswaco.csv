explainlikeimfive,ffhhgio,t3_etm9we,1579935413.0,"A computer's brain, the central processing unit (CPU), is a machine that can perform a limited number of operations. Collectively these operations are called ""machine code"" and include things like reading from and writing to memory (RAM), adding or subtracting numbers, comparing numbers to see if they're equal, and running instructions from a particular place in memory.

For example, a simple CPU might read instructions from memory and map instruction number 1 to the add operation, number 2 to subtraction, number 3 to comparing two numbers, and number 4 to branch / run future instructions based on the results of a comparison. Since raw numbers don't mean very much to humans, we assign names to the operations to make them easier to read. This is called ""assembly code"" and typically you'll see operations like MOV, ADD, SUB, BRA. 

Writing programs in assembly code is still pretty tedious, so some smart people came up with newer languages that are more readable to humans along with a special program called a compiler to convert the human-readable text into machine code. That way programmers can use familiar mathematical notation like `let x = 10` or `let y = x + z` rather than several lines of assembly code.

It's important to note that the computer doesn't really understand anything like a sentient being. It simply performs whatever operations are fed into it very quickly. Everything builds from that premise. 

One of my favorite professors walked into my Digital Logic class the first day carrying a 5 pound metal object called a ""flip flop"", an early form of computer storage. He slammed it on the desk to get our attention. ""This is a flip flop"", he said. ""It stores one bit of information."" He then took a tiny CPU out of his breast pocket. ""This is a Motorola 68000,"" he continued. ""It contains 30,000 flip flops. We're going to learn how it works."" And we did."
swift,ffhcd6b,t3_etm3rd,1579929723.0,"You have a few options. 

1. The easiest is to make a second network call when the first completes. This is called ""chaining"". Usually the connection will remain open so it's not actually creating a new TCP connection for every call.
2. You could use WebSockets, but your server would have to support it. 
3. It is possible for a web request to continue to return data indefinitely. You would use URLSession's `didReceiveData` delegate call, but you couldn't use JSON because it doesn't lend itself to being partially parsed. You could, for example, have the server return coordinate pairs followed by linefeeds. Scan the data in `didReceiveData` for linefeeds and parse the numbers by hand.

You should also see if your server supports HTTP 2.0 because it improves the situation where you have to wait for one request to complete before another one receives data."

You never know what's going to happen, so you test and test and test. You have beta users if possible. You look over every line of code that changed since the previous version. You run the app on bad networks, on every physical device you have, check network logs, etc. You test new installs and upgrades, even from very old versions because some people skip intermediary ones. 

Now any time an app gets into an unexpected state we log that to a log server and track it. We check crash logs regularly. The App Store has a slow rollout feature (""Phased Release"") now which would have been great back in the day. 

Software has always been this way. In the old days before the internet we'd finish the software and then burn 10,000 CD-ROMs. If you messed something up, you not only lost tens of thousands of dollars in inventory but you had to figure out how to get a fix to users.

iOSProgramming,ffd2wx3,t3_eswvgj,1579812363.0,"I don't have any particular resources, but my two cents:

I agree with keirmot: Do not over-engineer your apps. As Brian Kernighan said:

>**Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.**

Dependency injection helps. That is, create objects that are not dependent on global state. Pass whatever information the objects need into them. This isn't possible 100% of the time, but in general it's a good way to design code for flexibility, to eliminate spaghetti code, and for testing.

Do not create deep object hierarchies. Object-oriented programming is fine, but try not to create too many levels of classes, each with various method overrides. It makes code hard to follow because it jumps from one file to another and you can't just eyeball the code and figure out what is getting called.

Be judicious with callbacks. A calling B is easy to follow. A calling B calling C is more difficult. A calling B calling C who later calls D who then later calls E is even more difficult. Try to keep your call chains short.

Modularize your code in a way that allows you to replace modules (network, database, business logic) without having to modify code throughout the rest of the app. For example, we have a database object that that uses SQLite files. Rather than sprinkle SQL code throughout the entire app, I confine it to this one class. That allows me to swap the class out with another that writes to plain text files, all by changing only a few lines of code."

Hardcoding sizes was bad, though, once Apple started shipping phones with different sized screens. And you had to handle portrait vs landscape too, especially on iPads. Autolayout was supposed to completely replace manual layout, but in my opinion created more problems than it solved. 

So instead of setting up constraints, either in code or in the storyboard/xib, we write one routine per viewController to place the views where we want them. We have a few helper functions for centering views, stacking them (similar to UIStackView), pinning them to each other, etc. We call the placement routine whenever we need to, typically from viewWillAppear and viewWillTransitionToSize. 

It creates more code, which some people don't like, but it's more dynamic and flexible than autolayout and you never get those annoying autolayout exceptions or restraint warnings. Plus changes are highly readable in source code control, unlike storyboard constraints."

technology,fes8jg6,t1_fes2zlq,1579362554.0,"The original reason was memory. The first iPhones and iPads had very little RAM, 128MB for the iPhone and 256MB for the iPad. Even relatively simple web views took 50MB in our app. This left less RAM for the home screen and other apps, so slowed down the the whole system because apps were constantly being killed and relaunched. If our app hit 90MB the system would terminate it.  
   
Even today iPhones have about half of the RAM as Android phones. But i agree that privacy and platform control are part of the reason the rule still applies."
