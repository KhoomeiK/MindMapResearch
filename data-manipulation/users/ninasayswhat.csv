In my glee of having my first place I decided for some reason to dye my hair and make a nice meal. Stuck the hair dye on, and while waiting for it to develop I started on my nice meal with my new sharp knives. 

Yeah I ended up cutting the entire top of my index finger off, completely panicked by the sheer amount of blood, and I had no towels or anything to cover my finger with... I had to race across to next door, quickly introduce myself as the new neighbour, and ask to barrow some paper towels to stop the bleeding... as I was stood at the door I was bleeding all over their nice welcome mat.... 

Fast forward to ten minutes later, my head is stuck in her shower trying to wash the hair dye off, my finger is over her sink trying not to get blood anywhere else, she’s on the phone to the nhs 111 screaming something about not knowing if there’s a mug worth of blood. I felt silly going to A and E over a finger and I just wanted to stop the bleeding... she ended up getting mad with the 111 people so she just took me there anywhere bless her. 

It was an amazing first meet story, and as a running joke I would always get her a new welcome mat each year.

When someone first mentioned the word autism to me, I shunned the idea. I had the stereotype locked in my head and I didn’t think it fit. Then I researched it. I cannot explain to you the feeling that washed over me. The feeling of complete and utter relief. A psychologist helped explain what autism actually was. I want to shout it from the rooftops, I want to scream, I’m not a psychopath and I’m not broken and I’m not alone!!! I wanted to ring up all my old friends and school teachers and say ‘hey remember that time I did that weird thing, well...’  When I first went to an autism meet up I felt like an imposter, like maybe I was just pretending to fit in simply because I wanted too. But the things people were saying, the things they did and the way they thought, it was like I could see a little of myself in each of the group, I wasn’t making this up!!! I AM AUTISTIC!!! It doesn’t define me, nothing defines me, I am a human and I am complex. No one thing defines who I am. But who I am is very much an autistic individual and I could happily talk for hours about it. I can relive my entire childhood and tell the scared little girl that she isn’t alone. She isn’t a psychopath. She’s autistic, and that’s okay. So I’m sorry if I talk about it too much, but it makes me happy to talk about it, so I’m not going to stop.

dogs,fczdsj2,t3_ejl1e5,1578098937.0,"The best feeling. Ever. I rescued my big ol’ bear dog when he was around7. He was a northern Inuit cross or timber dog but either way he looked like a giant wolf, I was told he was a ‘wolfdog’ but I don’t buy into that crap. I had been told about his past and the way he acted when he was younger, it wasn’t good, but he had stopped digging and trying to escape and they told me he had started to mellow in his age. I was prepared for a lot of work. 5 weeks into owning him and I taught him all the tricks that they clearly hadn’t bothered, and realised that the 40 minute walks I was told he was getting wasn’t nearly enough. He wasn’t aggressive he was misunderstood. 

We took him to the alps on a walking holiday and in a small campsite in the middle of nowhere a small child followed us around our walk of the campsite so we stoped to ask her if she wanted to stroke the dog, she didn’t speak a word of English but she clearly wanted to. So we sat down and Cato laid down, and the girl gave him belly rubs and patted him for about half an hour. She pulled his hair a couple of times but he just looked at her and moved a little. 

The years I had with him were amazing, people would tell me how they were afraid of big dogs until they met Cato. The vets said he was the only big dog that they trusted putting their hand near or around his mouth. The local area has a stigma against dogs and kids and even adults would literally scream and run from us, until slowly more and more kids and family’s asked to stroke him, and me and Cato taught them how to approach dogs and let them come to you. Cato would stay along side me on our hikes and when another dog past I would stick my hand on his harness to let the other owner know I had control of my dog but I never needed to, he never approached a dog he would always let them come to him and then usually just go and smell a more interesting tree. He had the best soul I have ever met. I felt selfish having him, he should have been a therapy dog. I miss sharing him with people."

I’m glad someone was able to put that into the right words and explain it, and also glad it’s not just me"
conspiracy,fc64sm9,t1_fc63nih,1577472273.0,"I really hope this is sarcastic but there’s no /s so I’m genuinely concerned that you think the fact the earth goes through glacial and interglacial periods is a joke. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago, fair to say the climate has changed a little since then. I understand that people get pissy about it being hotter and colder in the past and all that shit. But that doesn’t matter does it, we can never compare the earth to an earth with no humans so we will never know for sure what the earth would be like without human activity. But we know for a fact what elements cause heat to become trapped in the atmosphere and we know for a fact humans have realised a fuck tonne of these chemicals. Do people just not believe humans have realised these elements? Do they not believe these chemicals cause warming? Do they think that if humans weren’t driving cars that volcanoes would randomly become more active and release those chemicals anyway? I genuinely don’t understand this way of thinking"
hikingwithdogs,fc5z7ny,t3_egbunv,1577468888.0,"When my old puppers back end started to go, we were told no more hikes. For a wolfdog this was torture. But I managed to find short flat 20 min walks in woods or near rivers to let him have a sniff and enjoy nature. If the vet says it, it’s for a reason. But by all means you can cheat a little, very flat and very short walks. But a dog does not know what’s best for them, just because she wants to keep hiking doesn’t mean she should, it might make the recovery process longer meaning you can’t get back to full hikes as quickly, which is better in the long term.

Edit: forgot to mention mind toys, when my puppet got a bit antsy at home, I tried reaching him new tricks and playing mind games with him, it really helped keep him calm. But every dog is different I guess"
