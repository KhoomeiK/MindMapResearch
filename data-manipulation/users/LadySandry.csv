JUST 100 miles?  That's 2-3 hrs.  Maybe my perception of acceptable distance and time is off or something but I wouldn't want to date someone that lived 3 hours away"

Congrats on getting married!"

Fantasy,ff9bu7d,t1_ff7mmpr,1579709402.0,"So I didn't know anything about the Witcher at all when I started the show, and honestly I guess I wasn't paying enough attention because I had no idea each of the main plots was supposed to be in a different time period.  A friend told me when we were chatting and I mentioned I wasn't sure about the show and it seemed all a bit disjointed and confusing.  I agree with the other poster that about episode 4 is when it actually gets better and more cohesive (and interesting really)."
AdviceAnimals,ff91o91,t1_ff8kcko,1579702623.0,">  copays

copays are at least a little easier.  Deductible with percentage after is a nightmare. And TBH I'm one of those people that will mostly not go in to the doctor unless they will tell me in advance how much it will cost.  I needed an x-ray on my wrist once, was quoted $100 with insurance at one place, and $30 at another.   Extrapolate that out towards the $$$ and varied bills from a hospital and 'shopping around' for medical care is exhausting and stressful.

Plus once you are there they might want to add on things, and that's way harder to deal with. Like, hey, first scan showed nothing so we want you to get another. Ok well, what's the procedure and diagnostic code so I can call my insurance first?? -_-"
AdviceAnimals,ff91909,t1_ff8kbiv,1579702304.0,"I'm confused on this 'forced' thing.  I can't see how they can force a conscious mentally sound individual to allow themselves to be admitted to a hospital at all, let alone a specific hospital.  At the very least surely a person could just leave after the urgent care person takes back their wheelchair.   I can't see how they can demand you do anything in particular tbh."
AdviceAnimals,ff90uh6,t1_ff8jssl,1579701994.0,"Yikes that's no fun.  Your husband doesn't have insurance through work (obviously assuming a lot here through baby and ability to quit work for a year , totally get that you might not be married)? Is your baby not covered either :( ?  Hopefully you get sorted out. They'll probably try birth control pills to get you on a cycle again (atleast that's what they did for my friend who was having constant spotting). Hopefully it's nothing too serious, best wishes for you."
todayilearned,ff6qba7,t1_ff5xugg,1579632655.0,"Which is also why child rearing is such a massive undertaking too. That whole 'takes a village' thing doesn't exist much anymore. It's almost always 95% the parents these days, no collective 'village' to help with raising the kids. Most people don't know their neighbors well enough that they'd leave their kids with them in an emergency.   And many parents today get all upset when another adult disciplines their kid even for safety issues (running where they shouldnt or something)"
todayilearned,ff6py7f,t1_ff6cbi9,1579632437.0,"I have a 15 lb one which is kind of the standard weight for adults. It's nowhere near enough to trouble a dog, especially a Labrador. Plus it's not like they are under the total 15 lbs, just a portion.  Dogs of that size are strong"
todayilearned,ff6pnco,t1_ff5tg5x,1579632255.0,"I find it hard to focus. I'll start something and spend what feels like little time on it, then set it aside and pick it up later.  I do a lot of craft type activities and sometimes it takes my ages to finish something simple. And other's I'll run into issues and hyper focus on 'solving' them."
todayilearned,ff6fox4,t1_ff5rgbp,1579626190.0,"Out of curiosity if you're willing to say, does your insurance cover your visits? I have an HSA and never meet my deductible, so I'm curious as to what people on average pay for these visits.  I rarely do to the doctor for things unless it's something I know will result in action not just ""go home and rest, drink fluids"" or ""just stay off it for a month and take tylenol if it hurts""."

IAmA,ff38tfk,t1_ff2g4z5,1579536403.0,"Eh, I have a chai latte or a green tea in the mornings. Never past lunch time. I don't drink coffee or soda at all.    Mine are more exertion headaches (if I play ultimate too long for example, regardless of the amount/ratio of water, gatorade, electrolyte w/e I drink I tend to get a headache by the time I get home) or tension headaches."
IAmA,ff28g2h,t1_ff26yg9,1579496848.0,"Thats good. A lot of companies give so little vacation time that spending two weeks without recoup would be tough.  My first couple years at my current job i only /had/ two weeks of vacation plus 1 of sick time. 

Unrelated question, how long before you can excercise and play sports again?"
IAmA,ff26v6x,t1_ff258sf,1579495495.0,Excedrin for me and that almost always has asprin in it.  Only think that works for my headaches. :/

AdviceAnimals,fesep06,t1_fesclci,1579364425.0,For us if we have a session scheduled its rarely canceled (although new guy has had to leace earlier than wed usually end the last couple times) we are switching games so not sure if h ell continue.  But its a matter if the initial scheduling. That why I asked for a 'schedule next session in person at the end of the prior session'.  It works so much better and no one has to wonder when to plan for and no one books something on top of it.
AdviceAnimals,fes5gbg,t1_fes2qqk,1579361598.0, Uh getting 5 grow Adults together for 6 or so hours is easy?  We have one who's planning a wedding and his wife doesn't drive. Another whose wife is a few months pregnant and lives in another timezone. One who is currently applying and interviewing trying to find a new job. Etc etc.   I cant imagine how difficult scheduling will be when the kiddo is born in particular.

science,fepok6v,t1_fepny10,1579326162.0,"True true. I play ultimate frisbee and one of the girls kept playing pick up until she was 8 months pregnant. (Honestly i was kind of nervous every timb e i had to mark her!)  The again  there is a friend who is 3 months along and is skipping ski trip this year (and likely the next x number of them come to think of it). :/  I usually play softball and ultimate myself these days. 

The running/hiking/camping for me is all likely defendant of what time of year it is and how pregnant.  Camping in the summer in texas is hard enough! Lol

Haha this one is surely true. That center of balance shift must be interesting to get used to! Glad you were ok after incident de pilates ball :)"
science,fepm3rp,t1_fepkknj,1579324112.0,"I think for me its a tad scary/disheartening to think Id have to give up most of the things I do every week for one reason or another.  I play quite a few sports throughout the year, do hot yoga, run, hike, camp, ski.  All of which are either on the 'no' list or would be too uncomfortable for a good portion of the time.   Plus my cousin and mom were both rare sick during a goodnportion of their pregnancies. Best rest would legit drive me crazy and dont get me started on the description of c-sections my coworker gave some of us while she was pregnant!  Ick.

Granted im not married so this isnt anything (hopefully) ill have to truly consider for a while now."
