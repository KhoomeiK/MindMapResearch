aww,ffee24t,t1_ffed1qu,1579844571.0,"So, Stir-Fry has been living out back of the cafe that I work at. She's been there for *at least* 15 years. We feed her every day and we have a little home set up for her in the back of the restaurant. She's got a heating pad and a ton of luxuries. She eats like a queen. Lol. She used to be very sick, but we were able to get her medicine despite her being feral and not susceptible to human contact. She's been healthy for at least 6 months now (finally!) yet she is deaf and we suspect partially blind. She's an old girl. But she's doing great. She's  basically the mascot of the restaurant."
aww,ffedc75,t1_ffed10x,1579843870.0,She really is :) she was very sick for a while and it took a long time but we were finally able to take her to the vet (she's feral and very skittish) and we gave her medicine and shes been doing great!
