bipolar,fcyvo7t,t3_ejj413,1578088087.0,"I'm a teacher too, and I know you can't make this shit up! 4th and 5th is my favorite age, mostly because of moments like these."

Teachers,fcxo03i,t1_f7wrkdf,1578067465.0,"Could you expand on what you mean by 'thisness'? I'm currently working on creating an adaptable curriculum, and I would love to hear from a devil's advocate."
bipolar,fcxdcp8,t1_fctr1y2,1578059885.0,"I'm so sorry for loss. I can't imagine  what it would be like to lose a parent.  Sending love and lots of hugs.

 Anniversaries are always hard, although I try to think of my grieving as honoring the person, and focus on the happy memories."
bipolar,fct3zao,t1_fcslxa6,1577932277.0,I would like to know too!
bipolar,fct2xlv,t1_fcsyhs7,1577931495.0,"I get this urge too. If I’m at home or somewhere else I can give into it, I will just stop and sit down. Sometimes in weird places too. And, like you say, I just detach from the world or kind of retreat inside myself? If I’m not interrupted I can lose hours this way. Then once I come out of it, I’ll have no memory of what I was thinking about, but this incredibly intense nagging of wanting to remember, like when you wake up after a dream. 

If I’m somewhere I can’t just stop, it takes all my focus and energy to push myself to keep moving, and I feel overly drained and exhausted.

I get concerned about laziness too because sometimes this causes me to not get things done I need to. But it’s definitely not by choice."
bipolar,fcklig2,t3_ehohni,1577727938.0,"I feel this so much. I just bought a book too (haven't read in ages) and it's supposed to be delivered today. 

Awesome job finding something to look forward to, I hope your book is good!"
bipolar,fckcm2c,t1_fck0b0a,1577722312.0,I've been taking Zyrtec everyday during the Spring for years without incident. But I've had some weird experiences with Benadryl. I never had any idea  it had something to do with BP.
bipolar,fckatt3,t1_fcka1bw,1577721117.0,"Lmao he is so not worth it. I need to stop giving so much when I get nothing in return. He keeps me around with all these promises, but I don't think he's actually followed through with any."
bipolar,fck9hss,t3_ehisl7,1577720185.0,Ugh an ex that keeps playing games with me. I've decided no more contact but I have the urge every second.
OkCupid,fck26y1,t1_fcigf1a,1577714342.0,">I third taking down the picture of you and the pretty girl, unless it is your sister and then you need to caption it!"
bipolar,fcj0zqu,t3_ehek04,1577674582.0,"This past year I finally got better about cooking for myself and wasting less food and money. There are lots of videos on YouTube about cooking on a budget, even with bulk cooking at the beginning of the week. I'd start there and use a premade shopping list at first so you can start to see how to use foods in different recipes. That way you aren't eating the same thing over and over. I had to meal plan every week for a while. But now that I've gotten used to it,  I don't have to plan it all out anymore, I'm just mindful of buying foods I can use in different ways."
bipolar,fcj0ayz,t3_ehfjnr,1577674102.0,"I stopped going because I always felt so shamed by them. I have terrible teeth, but haven't been in years."
bipolar,fci1kb1,t1_fchogli,1577656640.0,"I think what you wrote is awesome, and most people would sympathize and 'get it.' That would be really courageous to send, and think of how much lighter you'll feel both facing it and getting to go back. I say go for it! I had to send something similar to my excoworkers, but struggled to be so open and honest. Even so, they all were so loving and sweet about it. I really missed them too, so it meant a lot to me.

I am also a people pleaser, and that's exactly what happened to me recently. They kept piling things on me, and as a perfectionist too I would push myself harder and harder to make them exactly what they wanted. I'm really artistic and a good designer, and people always seem to take advantage of me, my talent and my niceness. I have a constant list of things people have asked me to design for them as favors.  The problem is that I actually deliver when I'm manic, which makes people keep asking. Until I just break and crumble under the weight of it all and disappear. It's a terrible way to live."
bipolar,fchwv4j,t1_fcd5aqv,1577655081.0,"Ugh this always pops into my head, especially when I'm feeling hopeful and positive. I think, ""Really, what's the point? I won't even be here."
bipolar,fchlyyp,t3_ehaua5,1577651669.0,"I have ghosted people in literally every single way as you (even the green organization I used to volunteer for and a clay throwing class that I sucked at haha.)  I almost always regret it, then feel like too much time has passed since I answered, so then i feel like I need to avoid them for the rest of my life. It's awful, and I feel so mean and callous sometimes."
bipolar,fchidjs,t1_fcgikb2,1577650714.0,Thank you so much for this advice. I just blew up my life and ruined my career and have been hiding in my house trying to reenter the world for the last 2 months. The feeling of guilt and hatred for myself keep pulling me back every time I start to feel hopeful. Going to work on acceptance.
bipolar,fcfz7ej,t3_egyaqq,1577635096.0,Thank you so much for posting this.
bipolar,fc8mqus,t3_egme5s,1577538096.0,I love your mom. Can we trade?
bipolar,fc163mj,t1_fc0ect6,1577309322.0,"Thank you so much for this advice, I find the self-loathing so hard to deal with. I leave most social situations berating myself for always making it weird and I bully myself over it for hours/days/weeks."
