You can make it through this."
SuicideWatch,ff394kg,t3_er9kki,1579536604.0,"It sound like crap but have you tried starting to love yourself first? Try looking at yourself in the mirror and telling yourself 1 single thing that is good about you. Then once that sinks in add another. You will soon find yourself believing it (because it's true) and then you can start to look for someone to be with.

Keep your chin up brother. We are all in this together. I'm pulling for you."
mentalhealth,fdhg3bz,t1_fdgnsm6,1578421901.0,You mean you can't see his color \ lack of color over the internets? Psssshhh...
depression,fd5iqpk,t3_ejx4cu,1578178021.0,Totally feel you. If you were to look at my life you'd think it's pretty decent. Nothing that bad happening at all. I should be happy and sometimes I am. Most of the time I'm not or at least haven't been in years. I understand where people like this are coming from but it doesn't make it any less hurtful. Depression sucks balls.
mentalhealth,fd3epy8,t1_fd2giuc,1578157630.0,"Welcome to Reddit. Hang out on the right subs and you will love it. 

I watch the first ten minutes of the news for the weather. Then I pack lunches for the family."
MEN_tality,fd35ulr,t3_ej2glr,1578155028.0,This reminds of a young man I was mentoring at work. He had major issues with filtering what he says. I worked with him on how to behave and was making such strides but manglement just could recognize it. They made comments exactly like your post and eventually they fired him. The shame is with a little positive feedback and patience he would have made a great technician.
SuicideWatch,fcys7q8,t3_ejjiij,1578085956.0,Hello. I know it sounds like bullshit but I love you. You are a unique creation and are special in a way I can never be. You are a fellow human being and I love that. I'm sure if I get the chance to know you there are many other things to love about you. Please don't do anything rash.
MEN_tality,fcxealc,t3_ej2b9r,1578060639.0,"That's a symptom of unhealthy coping mechanisms. Not having any way to release your feelings and work through them can cause anger and other issues. 

I was in your shoes not even a full year ago. I kept everything in and never showed any outward emotion other than anger really. It seemed like the only thing I could do since I had been raised with an unfeeling father and didn't know I could have emotions. I got to a breaking point when I nearly ended my life. My anger was affecting all areas of my life.

I got my meds adjusted and started therapy. The biggest benefit to me was therapy. She was able to help me figure out how to safely get my emotions in check and actually discuss what was bothering me. Having an impartial stranger to talk to was a huge help. I can tell her my deepest darkest secrets and I get no static back. Only support and suggestions if I ask for them. 

My point is that we men need to pay attention to our mental health and do what we need to do and if anyone has a problem with that they can shove off. Keeping it in will lead to major issues.

Keep your chin up. I'm pulling for you. We are all in this together."
MEN_tality,fcuv2be,t3_eiv6dh,1577989121.0,"At your age I think the best thing to focus on is taking care of yourself. It sucks to hear but relationships will come and go as you get older and get more life under you. Keep making new friends and new relationships and let the ones that fall apart fall apart. It's a very natural part of growing up.

You show some real maturity in wanting to get some advice and I hope you keep it up. I wasn't nearly that mature at your age."
mentalhealth,fct7hnv,t1_fct3bw5,1577934908.0,"What a dick. I hope karma kicks his ass royally.

Sorry you went through that. Depression itself sucks. Having someone taking advantage of it is reprehensible."
mentalhealth,fcsx0xf,t3_einxbw,1577927258.0,I am actually very optimistic for the upcoming year. I've made huge gains in my mental health and not need to start figuring a way to drop the dosage on my pills. The side effects are hard to manage but the other option wasn't very appealing. Thanks to my wife for helping.
mentalhealth,fcs8wja,t1_fcs3096,1577913110.0,Yoga helps with my pain. Meditation does also.
SuicideWatch,fcoivfj,t3_ei63pv,1577833317.0,"""Let it be"" has always spoken to me when I am super low."
mentalhealth,fcoir6j,t3_ei9t3g,1577833230.0,"Based on what you have written there is certainly something wrong with you. I can't say what since I barely understand my issues but you are not behaving in a ""normal"" manner. You do need to go for a run but after that you have to get some help. Your mom must be made to understand that mental illness is an illness and like an infection it's not likely to go away on it's own. 

I'm afraid that is all I have to offer. Without a means to get to a doctor\therapist I'm not sure there is much you can do. I'm very sorry you are going through this."
depression,fcoi8dy,t3_ei98b0,1577832857.0,"You partner sounds like my wife. She never seemed to care about my pain either. When I damn near ended it all she got the message and has been better since. 

I know it sounds cheesy but I do care my internet friend. I really do. I don't want anyone to go through the things I have and it sounds like you have and for that I am so very sorry. I wish I could take some of your pain for awhile and give you some rest. If you need to vent more I'll be happy to read whatever. Post or PM me, it's all fine."
SuicideWatch,fcohupn,t3_ei4thy,1577832592.0,If you feel like you will act on your suicidal thoughts you need to go to the hospital. At the very least you will get some short term help. You will still need to figure out a long term plan but they will make sure you can't hurt yourself for now.
GriefSupport,fcog76r,t3_ehwyw5,1577831461.0,"Who's cutting onions!?! 

I'm sorry for your loss. I can't imagine how hard it was\is."
depression,fcoeciw,t3_ei5th0,1577830178.0,Most people on social media are full of shit. Their lives suck as much as everyone else's. They only cherry pick the good stuff to put on facebook or whatever. They don't talk about the cat barfing on their pillow.
SuicideWatch,fcoduq4,t1_fcntr6l,1577829828.0,I would think that the younger brain would be more easily harmed by daily life than an older brain and actually be MORE susceptible to mental illness. As adults we should be doing what we can to make things better for younger folks and not worse. Then again most of the adults I know are dicks so it's not likely they are going out of their way to help.
mentalhealth,fcodidd,t1_fco37ak,1577829584.0,"I'd be dead right now without the meds so they are not all bad. You are right that medical docs tend to push pills more than the probably should but they don't really know any better.

Please don't write that there is barely no hope. There certainly is hope but we all need to work at it since there is no magic pill to fix us. Keep you chin up brother. We are all in this together. I'm pulling for you."
mentalhealth,fcmxtln,t1_fcmsa1q,1577796942.0,Discord makes me want to have a seizure though. Reddit is at least easy to use and not confusing.
mentalhealth,fcmxpo7,t1_fcler0a,1577796821.0,Facebook sucks.
mentalhealth,fcl4qle,t1_fcjzjvh,1577739775.0,It's encouraging to read that you are just hammering through it. That tells me you are a tough nut to crack so keep it up. We are all in this crap together so keep your chin up. I'm pulling for you.
mentalhealth,fcl4lgh,t1_fcjjiwi,1577739686.0,"No worries. If I find them I'm gonna post them here since I had so much trouble. Totally understand not writing them down. 

No clue on the hold issue. They said all the staff was busy and then never got back to me. 

I'll tell you that I'm doing great now. I had been and am in therapy and I've had several heart to heart talks with my wife and she's been so supportive. I had been carrying around a lot of past luggage and coming clean to her was so very liberating and freeing. She was totally cool with what I want and all my worries were for nothing. Thanks for asking."
mentalhealth,fcj2a3d,t1_fcizr53,1577675491.0,"Playing music while walking around sounds awesome! I mess about with the ukulele myself but I'm not very good at it yet. 

I'm in Western PA in the US so we can get snow most anytime now. You can always use your imagination I guess. :D

I hope you get some relief from this crap. I've had depression nearly as long as I can remember and it sucks!"
mentalhealth,fcizrge,t1_fcijxqn,1577673729.0,"If you have references on the US I'd love to see them. When I was super low, the hotline put me on hold and I bailed after a bit and the internet chat I found I was something like 40th in line and only had to wait over 2 hours to get someone. Obviously I made it and am really doing well now but I wasn't in a good state then and I know others are there so lets get that info out there."
mentalhealth,fcizgps,t1_fciyoky,1577673528.0,Yeah marshland would be a bit messy for meditation. Lol. I also like walking after dark in the winter times. The quiet is amazing at night especially if there is snow on the ground. It's like everything becomes magical and pure.
mentalhealth,fciyfzh,t3_ehcgsm,1577672834.0,I like to meditate out in the yard or a local park. Yoga helps center me too. Kinda breaks the cycle of depression.
SuicideWatch,fciuly3,t3_ehf21s,1577670192.0,"Wow this really hit home with me. I suppose my parents did their best but I never really learned that emotions were OK either. I too always hid what I felt. My father was not what you would call a caring man. If it weren't for my mum I'd be much worse off.

If I were there I'd rub your back and stroke your hair and tell you everything is going to be OK. I wish I could comfort you friend. I really wish I could. I know as well as any what that means."
mentalhealth,fbwlxlb,t3_eeslti,1577153394.0,There are roughly 86 Billion neurons in the brain. They interact in unexpected ways to create the person you are. That makes a mathematical solution unlikely.
