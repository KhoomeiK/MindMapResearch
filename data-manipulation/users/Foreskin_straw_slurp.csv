unpopularopinion,fec5l1t,t3_eo5bdk,1578966990.0,"My mom raised to be a fucking pussy. Last year this kid pushed me twice and I didn’t have the balls to crack him in the face. I hate it so much. Still, love you mom, but you raised me wrong."
FuckYouKaren,fec5e6q,t1_fec51jx,1578966907.0,Um... wot?
FuckYouKaren,fec4u8n,t1_fec1xxl,1578966670.0,"Lol exactly. Also if you’re 22 and you wake up at 10, unless it’s a weekend, that’s a statistical anomaly."
FuckYouKaren,fec1gw7,t3_eo40v1,1578965265.0,Bold of you to assume I get any sleep and that I’m not stressed the fuck out. Also pretty fucking bold of you to think that being 22 means you’re full of energy. Wait at the fucking line asshole or fucking leave dumbass.

depression,fec0mo9,t1_febrmkx,1578964896.0,"If god is real, then he’s a complete asshole. Isn’t Christianity all about “treat people the way you want to be treated”? Well “god” sure as hell doesn’t follow that if my pain is his plan. If other people’s pain and suffering is his “plan”, then he could go fuck himself."
depression,fec01uy,t1_febrvla,1578964784.0,"I know this sounds weird and shit, but I read this short (not so short) story that someone wrote. It was so ducking amazing and well written. After finishing it, I realized just how boring life is. So fucking uneventful. There is no such thing as a god, what you see around you is what exists."
amiugly,fe6nk9m,t3_enxf71,1578897128.0,"Definitely not ugly. Try to lose a little weight. You’re not fat, just a little chubby, and that’s fine for now, but you’ll have to manage it some time (me too). But I’d say 6.5/10"
