Iran killed 1500 protesters in November. That right there is enough to know that the regime is out of hand. Then they funded groups that laid siege to another country's embassy. Also a little loose cannon-y. Then they go ahead and solidify their position as a loose cannon by shooting down a civilian airliner. - and this only covers 2019

todayilearned,fcloik0,t1_fclnsm4,1577752641.0,"personally, i think that is part of the problem. 

It is upsetting that people everywhere are not afforded the basic right of healthcare, but nothing I said is really debatable. Countless business owners and boards of directors have validated that if profits dip too low, they will close down and invest money elsewhere. 

Not accepting this as valid brings us zero percent closer to solving the issue of healthcare."
todayilearned,fcln0a6,t1_fcllnaz,1577751613.0,"No offense, but you are obviously not a business person. 

Every business has to turn a profit that it's owner/board of directors feels is ""worth it.""

if, at the end of the year the business is not making enough money, it would make more sense to use the capital necessary for business operations in any other way that will meet that ""worth it"" threshold. 

this is especially true for larger corporations, due to the large amount of capital required. 

i mean, if your business is making 1 million/year, but you could sell it for 100 million, and EASILY make more than that by letting it sit in a money market account, why would you choose to earn less? 

If you are thinking that you would choose to earn less for humanitarian purposes, just so all the people you employ will remain employed, you wouldnt. you would see that the extra 4-6 million you would earn by putting your money in the stock market could go waaaaayyyyyyy further toward any humanitarian goal than keeping everybody working for your company.... 

And for the record, the argument against government mandated anything in business, is that a lot of people believe that a lot of these problems are the result of the mandates, not mismanagement."
