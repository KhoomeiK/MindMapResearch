AnimalsBeingBros,fewwhma,t1_fewgcz7,1579420566.0,"As a fellow lab saver- I wholly thank you. We love our big, goofy girl more than life. No clue how someone kn e could have treated her so badly in the first place. Dog paw hi fives!"
IncelTears,feh5bhw,t3_eoliti,1579109451.0,"This part I have never understood. My husband is 5'8"". I'm 5'2"". He TOWERS above me! What do these guys think height has to do with anything?! I know couples of all height combos and I don't think anyone ever cared one way or the other. I don't get it? This must be some new shit and I'm getting old."
NoStupidQuestions,feevaws,t1_feep4q8,1579041983.0,"I'm really, really good at crafts. I'm really, really bad at computers. I suppose I should just dodge the internet and start making fart filtering finery."

PublicFreakout,feem0gr,t1_fee8ptd,1579036470.0,"That is a perfect way to describe what I couldn't put into words! I'm 37- grew up on AOL instant messenger and Ebaums, and Rotten.com. the things I saw on Rotten- I can still pull a very specific photo of a man's head with long dreadlocks on wroght iron fence spikes, his body on the ground- after having jumped and well...gravity. Images like that are the Hot Ones of my brain. This felt like Tabasco at best.

Edit: I forgot to mention Nat Geo magazine and the image from a 1980's National Geographic of an eye procedure happening in Africa involving what looked like a spoon. It haunts me. Shows up distorted in dreams. I don't do eyeballs. Our brains are crazy. That I can remember something that graphic from 30 years ago- what?"
Art,feel9y9,t3_eolpr5,1579036045.0,I just love this! How do you get started learning the platforms necessary to do this amazing work?! I would live some resources on how you guys create this epic pixel art!!!
trashy,feee90w,t3_eolutl,1579031952.0,"She's actual trash. On a side note- I have to say in my over-a-decade serving/bartending stint I worked in Houston, Minnesota, Indiana, and Chicago, and this post is complete farse. 

Best tippers: lower to lower middle class, and blue collar. They understand the value of a days work, and often tipped WAY more than they could probably comfortably afford.

Worst tippers: Every white guy over 45 who never had a child work as a server. Any table that you treat as less important to the next one. You favor that big party over the quiet man in the corner? Annoyed he will probably leave you a 5$? He feels that, too. A lot of times the bad tips are your own damn fault. They were mine! 

I found that as a server that To Insure Prompt Service- one only needs to be kind and quick. Big problem? Be honest with the customer. Disappointed as a customer? Tell your server kindly, and chances are that any problem you had will be quickly remedied.  

The more you value your time, and a hard day's work, the better you will be at recognizing when someone is living their life in the same manner, and right back atcha."

ATBGE,fdmdy42,t1_fcxp3lz,1578546783.0,That sounds oddly cheap for them? I know that sounds nuts.
relationship_advice,fcwwxl3,t3_ejc1xl,1578041131.0,"Your wife uses her frustration as an excuse to take a pass every evening. She sees you two in separate shifts, and I think that can be fixed! Start making the kids lunches for her in the mornings while she is brushing teeth and tying shoes. Then ask her if you two could make dinner together. Try parenting WITH eachother instead of around eachother, remembering to build in times where each of you can go run an errand alone. Schedule a date night, and hire a babysitter. Hire a babysitter and book a massage in house for the both of you. She needs a lot, but for starters it sounds like she really just needs a hand. Good luck!"
