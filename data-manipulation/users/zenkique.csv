worldnews,ffdzya7,t1_ffdye8w,1579833141.0,I’m merely musing over the possibility that the swine present in Kansas in the early 1900’s were only there because Europeans brought pigs with them to the “new world” - and that population of pigs provided the environment for the swine flu to develop in and subsequently be transmitted to humans.

And the vast majority of swine in the Americas did in fact come from the population brought here by the Europeans, many of which were let loose and allowed to become feral and breed.

Polynesians, Africans, Vikings and even the Chinese likely all reached the Americas long before Western Europeans, but the Western Europeans definitely brought pigs with them.

Here you go, Reek, I’m gonna help you out young man: Take the pic with the degree propped up against a screen with your Reddit profile on display, cover your name with a post-it or index card with your silly username written on it.
