I suspect your disapproval was known before this whole thing flared up. 4 months of decorating is an unusual burden to presume to burden anyone with, and this house decorating seems something of a sacred and consuming ritual. Not to judge it for that, but it needs to be treated as such, as they seem to hold it as a non-starter over you being involved in the family.   
 You would be involved whether you participated in the decorating or not.  They (the parents and your fiance) insist on it over the values of honesty and honoring the partnership that you seem to want to have. This needs to be sorted before anything moves to the next level (marriage, house, decorations schemes, etc)."

It's certainly not your job to parent your parents, maybe not until they reach old age.   As long as they aren't trying to bribe you toward their side with hugs and affection,  maybe you're picking up their own nervousness about not wanting you to be too damaged from what's happening between them.

Doesn't excuse the climbing the fence and stealing eggs, just saying this isn't common in my world.  BTW, I have high fences to keep my boy from ""eloping"" and the gate was left open a couple years ago and he got out naked, and was dancing in front of the trees (or with the trees, I'm not sure) out near the street.  A lady called the police, and I heard the odd sounds in the front yard and ran out and got him.  The lady wouldn't look at me, but I'm glad she stopped traffic and I walked the police around my property to show that everything is locked up tight, and this one gate that I never used must have been opened by the utility company and never closed right.  Better than him wandering off into a stream or river, like that poor kid in the bronx a few years ago.    He doesn't do this anymore, and will keep his clothes on outside now (he's 16)."

On another note, I don't think we should dismiss out of hand our poster's comments about "" WHORING ME OUT FOR MONEY.""  There is a violation here that she is experiencing in a physical way, in that her body, her face, and actions are being made public, explicitly against her wishes.
