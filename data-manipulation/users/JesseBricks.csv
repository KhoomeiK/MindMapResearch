The Mona Lisa theft is pretty hard to beat. And of course the Nazis had a unique approach, some would visit local museums and furnish their new houses with their favourite pieces. Not quite a ""heist"", I guess, but imagine having Lady with an Ermine hanging on your wall:

A more recent theft was of a piece worth £4.8 million ... a solid gold toilet, taken from Blenheim Palace no less. Looks like it might still be missing:

Think I heard somewhere the campaign against her started under Poroshenko, the previous Ukraine president. It looks like they were after her and then later tied Trump in by offering help with his campaign.

It reminds me of stories, like (pre president) Trump telling a contractor he hadn't paid to ""use my name"" with business conacts as his payment. And Michael Cohen selling his services as a liason between the business world and Trump.

Looks like Giulianni and co were operating a similar thing where they enrich themselves through their ties to Trump and offered him help with his election in return."

*""At eleven o'clock, unobserved but by this official audience, down the Boulevard Waterloo came the advance-guard of the German army. It consisted of three men, a captain and two privates on bicycles. Their rifles were slung across their shoulders, they rode unwarily, with as little concern as the members of a touring-club out for a holiday. Behind them so close upon each other that to cross from one sidewalk to the other was not possible, came the Uhlans [cavalry], infantry, and the guns. For two hours I watched them, and then, bored with the monotony of it, returned to the hotel. After an hour, from beneath my window, I still could hear them; another hour and another went by. They still were passing.""*

*""And for three days and three nights through Brussels it roared and rumbled, a cataract of molten lead. The infantry marched singing, with their iron-shod boots beating out the time. They sang Fatherland, My Fatherland. Between each line of song they took three steps. At times 2000 men were singing together in absolute rhythm and beat.""*
