Learning about tehniques, trying out different methods, starting over and over, throwing away a lot of drawings. But the main thing is you have to start. Read a book about drawing, try out the things they discuss there. Drawing with a right side of the brain or smth like that was a good beginner book."

Dashcam,ff5hevl,t1_ff4d7zn,1579592988.0,"I have viofo a119 v3. If you look on the sidebar then you see that it's recomended budget cam. I put mine on the passenger side behind the mirror. Almost not seen while driving. I would say that it's a really good camera for the money. It has sony sensor, quite good low light performance and parking mode. Lens is with wide field of view. And it's offline so no chinese cloud to worry about. And because it has a capacitor, not battery, you can just pop it off the gps mount and it turns off."

Brogress,fejk9s4,t1_fejj7i1,1579177700.0,"Yeah, ofc whatever you lift makes you muscles grow. It's just a common knowledge or urban legend or whatever. I think it comes from the fact that Starting Strenght advises on 3x5 sets. And a lot of people start lifting with starting strenght programs. So lift however you want, if you work your muscles they will probably grow. I think the point is also that the weight must be as much as possible so that you still finish the reps but barely."

Brogress,fejfo9p,t1_fejddfr,1579171954.0,The main theory is that if you do about five reps then you are training with bigger weights and that should make you stronger. If you do about 13 reps then you train with a bit smaller weights but you work your muscle more so it grows bigger.

AskReddit,feho338,t1_fehjc21,1579120462.0,"The invisibility was a side effect for ""weaker"" persons. He made the One ring for himself, putting some of his power in it. He needs to rule wraith world and the real world, if a human or a hobbit wears it, then the invisibility is just going to the wraith world. The ring corrupts and makes so that its wearers go towards him. It's kinda like a hocrux with a mind and a will. Also it has some power from a Maia (Sauron) - an entity that helped shape the world. It isn't easy to use that kind of power, you need strength of mind, that's why only men became ring wraiths Basically it's a god ring, with immense power that wants to steer you towards the dark side and corruption. It also has control over other lesser rings that were created with Sauron backdoors in their code, if you know how to use it. Only really powerful being, like Tom Bombadil were truly uneffected by the One Ring."
