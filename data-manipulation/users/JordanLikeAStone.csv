selfhelp,ffgmp9h,t3_eti2q8,1579909813.0,Have you ever researched BPD? This sounds like some of the symptoms.
BPD,ff977bd,t1_ff7y6cq,1579706452.0,"Came here to say this! Anyone reading this, come check out r/MaladaptiveDaydreaming or google it to learn more. I felt so much better when I discovered other people did this."
BPD,ff7jo4z,t1_ff7d2ws,1579651129.0,Wowwww fucking serious? What an asshole. That was very unkind and insensitive of her. I’m so sorry
BPD,ff7culf,t3_es0u01,1579646597.0,What happened with Samaritan’s??
PCOS,ff6ue8p,t1_ff3e5te,1579635082.0,"Maybe we should all vote on every single topic we want condensed just because someone might find it annoying.

No one is saying keto is a cure all. Maybe you should analyze why it bothers you so much."
PCOS,ff3cjnu,t1_ff1gatb,1579538449.0,"Who is saying it's a cure-all? Low carb is proven to help insulin resistance, but I don't think anyone is saying keto is a cure-all. And if you don't have insulin resistance, then I don't know if low-carb at all is the answer. But most of us have insulin resistance and do have success with low carb or keto. Why do we have to have a separate thread to talk about that?"
PCOS,ff3cbyy,t1_ff1sdiu,1579538339.0,How am I gatekeeping? YOU are the one saying all these posts that you don't like belong in a megathread because they annoy you so much
selfimprovement,ff15mm7,t3_er0o74,1579475480.0,Do you have a history of depression? It can have a lasting impact on cognitive ability
PCOS,ff152x4,t1_fezwpmo,1579475287.0,Maybe you should leave
PCOS,ff150ox,t1_fezhxoz,1579475263.0,Why does someone else’s success story affect you? They’re happy they found something that works for them.
PCOS,ff14sv6,t1_ff0bd0j,1579475178.0,Are you really going to split hairs when they specify it’s their personal cure?
BPD,fekby2k,t1_fejziak,1579196847.0,"It’s been just a few dates though, right? Not super long. They’re just looking out for you. Dude is way older than you. So yes it’s good that things are great so far, but it’s good to be cautious."
PCOS,fek790r,t3_epa6c0,1579194068.0,The goddess of r/PCOS! Love this.
Parenting,fdcjxzv,t1_fdce8ff,1578276760.0,Can you tell me interesting things? I’m a curious 5-year-old at heart
PCOS,fdc2gnx,t3_eke90k,1578265788.0,How long have you been experiencing this?
BPD,fdc2axa,t1_fdb2t0a,1578265697.0,"I hope you find answers. This disorder is chaotic. And it is scary and confusing! Even when you do find an answer for what’s wrong with you, it’s the beginning of an entire journey. One that’s been years long for me. So at first it seems like you have more questions than answers, but at least it’s a reason for why you are the way you are. That’s a start :)
Good luck in your journey"
PCOS,fd3zqsb,t1_fd2kjaa,1578163045.0,That is a good point. Thank you for your insight!
BPD,fcudfse,t3_eiywo8,1577978363.0,"It’s basically mania it sounds like. I don’t know if mania is a recognized symptom in BPD because it seems so linked to stimuli/outside events, where as something like bipolar mania is not triggered by specific events, in fact, you could argue that it incites specific events. The difference between “I just got a text from my FP, I feel so high!!!” And “I feel so high right now I’m going to buy lots of things to celebrate because fuck budgeting!” Something like that is how I view it"
MaladaptiveDreaming,fcsr1xm,t3_eipsui,1577922943.0,Yep this is exactly what I do
BPD,fcsp3hd,t1_fcsbs6p,1577921543.0,I think they’re downvoting you because you’re being an absolute tool about it
