depression,ffasbyg,t1_ffas65v,1579743347.0,"Oh trust me, it's not quite as bad or embarrassing for you to be honest. It's not as embarrassing until you actually get to my age and still have barely accomplished anything. Apply for jobs and get all that driving shit out of the way as soon as you can so if you do have struggles, your young enough that it's not so bad. At my age, it's terrible."
depression,fda6l79,t1_fd5db82,1578242296.0,Holy crap. You just described me nearly perfectly...
depression,fd7dko0,t1_fd7d80d,1578202812.0,"I was never really bullied specifically for being thin, rather just being smaller than most boys in the grade in general. It was mostly in middle school. I was really short up until 6th grade when I had a growth spurt and got taller and thinner but even then I was still shorter than most. It wasn't until senior year of high school when I finally caught up to most in height and got to just under average. Tall enough to be eye level atleast."
depression,fd7cy6k,t1_fd7corb,1578202540.0,Damn that sucks man. For me I look sickly thin even though I'm a healthy weight. I just weigh a lot more than I look apparently. Can't imagine how bad you have it

depression,fc4sf16,t1_fc4s4ss,1577426666.0,"I know its not. Truth be told I don't actually want to date; I just crave it from time to time because of this cursed body's desires and flawed biology constantly pulling me towards relationships. I used to be able to kill my sex drive and not desire a partner at all, but now I can't."
depression,fc4sah2,t1_fc4s4cx,1577426538.0,"Trust me, I know. I'm working on these problems at the moment. I'm applying for jobs and studying for the test and all. (I failed it twice btw, I don't know how) but lately people have been getting on me about getting a job even more even though I'm trying. It's getting on my nerves. So I'm planning to work 60 hours a week and go to school full time to try to outdo everyone. Then we'll see how much trash they'll be talking when I have three times as much in my account as them. I don't care if it kills me, I'll do it or atleast die trying."
depression,fc4rpiv,t1_fc4rgwe,1577425954.0,"I'm just under average height at 5'8. It's alright I guess. People shorter than me say, ""your not that much taller than me,"" and people taller than me say, ""your not that short,"" I don't even know how to feel about it anymore."
depression,fc4rdgd,t1_fc4qn6a,1577425616.0,"I've been trying :( I studied a lot and still failed somehow although I did rush a lil. I can pass tests at school but can't pass that smh. And I tried different hair styles, I don't know. Problem is I've had the same hair style for years and it's just the way everyone's used to seeing me so when they saw me with different hair style it was a bit weird for them. I've always been bothered by my height, although I did grow 2 inches my senior year of high school (5'6 to 5'8) so I'm still growing. Hopefully I can make it to atleast 5'11 or so. My dad was close to 6 feet so I might still have a chance. I had shitty sleeping habits in HS and barely drank milk but I fixed that so I'm growing again. For hobbies I picked up video editing, animation, making videos and memes (I LOVE making videos on YouTube and memes on instagram) and making video games. I want to work but I'll lose a significant amount of time to work on projects. Oh well, guess I'll have to sacrifice time for work. I feel like such a loser who's stuck in a hole. No matter how hard I try to crawl out of it I get tossed right back into it."
depression,fc4pdaf,t1_fc4pb87,1577423680.0,"Nice joke, but don't actually do it. That wouldn't be funny at all."
angry,fc4nif4,t1_fc4n8c6,1577421979.0,"It is possible. One of my cousins once had 3 jobs at once, although I'm pretty sure that was when he wasn't in school. I know it's probably a bad idea and most certainly going to wreck my life, but at this point I'm getting fed up with the comments. It's annoying me a lot so at this point I'm going to do my best to try to outdo them. They can't talk shit if I'm working more than they are and going to school, right?"
depression,fc4iufa,t1_fc4ieyl,1577417920.0,EXACTLY WHAT I'M DEATHLY AFRAID OF!!!
depression,fc4ib09,t1_fc4i9sn,1577417472.0,We'll just have to see about that.
depression,fc4gas7,t1_fc4g4km,1577415813.0,"By the way, I didn't mean talking like that. I meant talking as in just friends. I never tried anything because I knew better than to try with her. But anyway, yeah he does tbh. He's taller (judging from pics and videos, she told me shes 5'8"", same height as me and her bf looks about 5'10"" maybe 5'11ish. He also does wrestling and stuff so yeah there's both of that."
depression,fc4flvx,t1_fc4fe24,1577415244.0,"I mean to be fair, her boyfriend doesn't have a job either and I'm preeeetty sure he doesn't drive quite yet, although I could be wrong about the latter."
depression,fc4f4yg,t1_fc4etk9,1577414859.0,Same. I am far below the standards of any girl or boy these days (I'm bi although I'm still in preference to women) so I don't bother trying. Same reason I never dated or tried in high school; same reason now. Probably won't change.
depression,fc4f1xp,t1_fc4en9b,1577414790.0,"Yeah, nah. Me and her were actually pretty good friends. I've never met her in person but we always talk on Snapchat and make eachother laugh. She's funny. I'm funny. She has a boyfriend too, so there's that. I've been ignoring her and her friend though for the past few days because of the standards. When I told her friend I'm looking for jobs, she just went, ""yeah lmao why don't you have one, and why don't you drive"" and I just said ""Idk"" although I found it a bit rude. Granted, she had a point because I really should be by now and I'm working on it, but it's pretty fucking rude to say something like that to someone who KNOWS the issue and is TRYING to fix it. That's like saying to a 200 lb person who's dieting and working out to lose weight, ""yeah lmao why aren't you like 140?"" or ""Why'd you even get to 200 in the first place?"" I stalled driving in high school simply because I didn't feel ready; I was scared of getting into a crash. And as for jobs, I was focusing on school at the time. Now I'm trying to fix both of those issues, and it's quite annoying when everyone's talking about their jobs or asking me why I don't work yet."
depression,fc4e5pb,t1_fc4dyk4,1577414057.0,"The sad thing is, I'm bisexual too, as I learned about myself just starting college a few months ago. You'd think I would have found someone, but nope. I guess that goes to show how much of a loser I really am."
depression,fc4dqp6,t1_fc4doct,1577413711.0,Sometimes same. I fantasize about this sort of thing a lot to be honest.
depression,fc4dp24,t1_fc4de2d,1577413672.0,"Same honestly. I want a girl who actually cares about me. Most girls I know for some reason seem to have a hard time expressing how much they care, atleast in comparison to guys; I'm always the one doing nice things for them. I'm always the one asking how they're doing, etc. If they for example knew I hadn't eaten for like a day, they'd barely bat an eye."
depression,fc4djy8,t1_fc4d5th,1577413555.0,"It really sucks you know. Some people are just born into having things easy. Some are just born tall and good looking. Some are born into rich families. I know this girl who by far takes the cake for the best looking genetics me and my friends have ever seen. Even the really hot girls saw her and were like ""damn, she's hot."" She has literally everything. She's naturally slim, a little tall for a girl, blue eyes, etc. And then you have me, average height, average or below average looks, brown eyes, and pretty much average weight. My friends think I'm skinny as fuck but that's because I'm pretty much the only one of my usual group of friends who isn't 200 pounds and is actually a normal weight. Genetics are unfair and there's not much you can do about it. For example, I can train in martial arts and become a black belt, but all that training becomes equalized if a 6'4 240 lb dude walks in and knows even half the stuff I know about fighting. And there's nothing I can do to make myself look better past what my genetics allow."
depression,fc4d0ku,t1_fc4cuf1,1577413117.0,"I'm trying to obtain these things at the moment although constantly failing. I pretty much fail at everything I do except for school, and even then I'm still not getting the best grades. For my first semester of college most classes were in the B ranges and one or two at C's. I can't imagine how bad it'll be when I start working."
angry,fbzp1j2,t1_fbzodq2,1577254656.0,"It's still super embarrassing that at my age, I haven't worked. I really need a job badly"
