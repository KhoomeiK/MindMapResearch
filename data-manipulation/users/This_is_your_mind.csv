Words, different ones.

Everything you've heard about God, is about the same thing. Different descriptions, depictions, explanations, and claims. It is all about the same thing though. Just like we could say hue, color, contrast, infrared, electricity, magnetism, to all mean 'differing wavelengths of light'.

There are many 'differing wavelengths of light', and we call them God, infinity, reality, consciousness, the ground of being, the origin, the one, singularity.

Anyway, it appears you have heard about it before so maybe it's not so hidden, and you're just rejecting it. That's alright. No shade. No judgement. I rejected for most of my life. If this is the case, it appears hidden because you don't want to see it; you're rejecting it actively. It's here right now, and you can literally see it, feel it, hear it, taste it, smell it, think it, be it. Don't fret. The light is blinding. You have to learn how to take a peek before you can open your eyes. That's what it's about, limiting.

Integrated, yes, but I won't try to reform what I experienced, I will just let it affect me as it has, as it will. 

I'm not anymore. Certainly, I was before. To me, all that existed was what I could perceive. To quote Daniel Kahneman (author of a book I'm reading): ""What you see is all there is"". Obviously this is incorrect (as he points out), but this is the delusion I was blessed with for a short moment- all I saw was love.

Thank you for the plug. No idea that he wrote a book, I will definitely give it a read when I'm finished with the one I'm reading. What a beautiful character.

It's simple: I want the best life that I can have. Whatever that entails. Whatever is best. Couldn't know it, but I will fulfill it. As will you; it is just nice to be able to realize that once in a while. Or often. Whatever is best.

I can tell you that having zero memory allows for a lot of different types of experience, very 'abnormal' types. That's something I learned through direct experience and reflection of it, no words necessary. Just the language of process. Maybe that's some indication. I'm sure you've heard some things about DMT. It is a very different experience from ordinary life. To the extent that DMT affects your reality, is the extent that I've been able to alter my reality. Basically, completely. But see it's not like I want to live in hyperspace. There's a reason that we created an earth to live on. It isn't even as if I want to be able to control my reality completely, or whenever I want. I want to be limited as I am. If I didn't want that, I would be dead, and therefore limitless, formless. I love life too much to be dead, for now. For a while. Until my time comes. Know, though, that as your divine experiences have shaped you- nothing is lost. Nothing is forgotten to the eternal witness. The eternal witness that currently embodies me is quite pleased with the freedom I've allowed. 

To be clear, I'm not claiming to be a God among men. I cannot shape reality however I want to, I am a man. Limited. Fragmented. Beautifully, fragmented. Blessed, to be able to have a discourse with delusion and walk away when I need to. 

Point taken, thanks for engaging with me."
philosophy,ffivo4h,t1_ffipc91,1579983818.0,"It can be both measured and tested. Via anything that is in my control. Give me an opportunity, and I will prove it to you if I'm able. Anything that you think I could control that would tip the scale one way or another, just let me know. I will be your subject, willingly. Just gotta give me a chance. 

Through reason alone I can demonstrate power. I have free will. We all do. You can decide that you don't have free will, but understand that's a decision. The underlying assumption is that you do have free will, to decide that you don't have free will is an exercise of your will. To deny this, is to deny will and volition completely. That's alright if you want to do that, but know it is a choice that I'm not making at the moment.

Reason is a power that we all have. If it didn't direct or influence the course of events, there would be no reason to have reason, aside from keeping up the illusion. But, clearly there is more use to reason than just illusion. I don't think I need to explain that, I think that you know it. If you don't know it, continue to assume it until you do.

My point of view doesn't collide with most. It incorporates most. I'm a very open person. You don't need to believe in anything beyond material to accept experience as I have. You would just need to believe that consciousness/awareness/God/everything is a material in and of itself. It is the most fundamental thing in existence, because it created itself out of itself. It incorporates everything. It incorporates nothing. It is not just infinite, but infinity. True infinity. See, I can say whatever I want about infinity, and it will be true. The same is true for you. What could you say about it to prove me wrong? That it doesn't exist? It doesn't. Go ahead, point to it, show that it exists. You can't. That it does exist? It does. I know it because I live it, we all do. That it's red? Sure it is, just find something red, there's your proof. That it's blue? Same answer, but with blue. Seem a little paradoxical? It is. Nobody understand infinity, that is literally impossible. Infinity is limitless, we are limited. You can understand that fact, but you cannot ever understand limitless. The very words I'm using are limits of meaning. Filters of it. So I couldn't possible explain it to you, because that would be a limited explanation from my limited intimacy. A limited explanation is not infinity. But, infinity is a limited explanation. The word itself, is the explanation. So is the symbol (lemniscate), which is less limited than the word, because a word is just a more limited symbol. As is the depiction of a mobius strip. That's a pretty good explanation of infinity. Pretty interesting how two sides are one, yeah? Or how the side literally never ends? That's where we live dude. A one dimensional path through space- ie time. In one dimension, there is nothing but singularity.

We live in infinity. We live infinity. As long as you believe that infinity is material, you can keep your materialist beliefs (speaking very generally here). If it starts to get shaky and too hard to keep up, maybe it's time to abandon the notion that you're griping with. Experience will still be here waiting for you, relatively unphased.

It does seem that you're assuming that I think I'm extra special, or something. That isn't the case, I'm not above anybody. I'm right here in the middle, with the rest of us. I am special, very special. But, we all are. There are specific things that make me special in particular, and the same is true for everybody else. I have no reason to compare and contrast, I just want love. I want to love, I want to be loved, I want it all. And I do that, all the time. I love myself, truly. It's a blessing I've found. It's a blessing everybody can find. Some will find it harder than others. For those that stick to it, it will get easier. And they will be truly rewarded. 

You don't need to adopt any of my beliefs or viewpoints to experience that for yourself. All you need to do is try to love yourself a little more. Not that you don't already love yourself (you do on some level, always), but there is an endless supply of love, so you can't really waste it. Give it to everybody, give a fuck ton of it to yourself, it is limitless. Love is the fabric that holds us all together. Whether or not this is true, even if everything I'm saying here is stupid and incorrect, it doesn't matter. I'm fulfilling the duty I've taken to- being a good person. That's all I really care about, and it's *super* easy to do. It's **way** easier than being a neutral or bad person. If you want to be a good person, love yourself and love others. If you want to be a great person, spend some more time understanding what it means to love, how you can do it more often or in different ways. If you want to transcend, just love. There is nothing else. Love it all, and you will never fail. I promise.

The special ""power"" that I've gained through divine experience is utter and complete fulfillment of my volition. Everything that I want to happen, will happen.  This isn't something I think, this isn't something I believe, this is something I know. I totally get that you can't accept that by word alone, I probably wouldn't either. I stand though, it is true. I don't want things that can't happen to happen, so they won't. That would be utterly confusing and probably take away all meaning from reality. Like if all of a sudden I could fly, nothing would make any sense, so I would have no reference frame to create meaning. I like meaning, it's one of my goals here on Earth. To create meaning. If something happened that I didn't think I wanted, I just didn't understand that I actually did want it. And maybe I still don't. But, everything leads to an end, in this limited human form I take. The end is not the goal, but getting there is. The only way to get there is through experience. So, experience is ultimately what I want, and it is a gift that can't ever be taken away from me. 

I have proved this time and time again. Divine experience can happen, and it can be transformative. Simply, because I want it to be. Last night, I transformed myself yet again. I broke this universe, and bent it into a new one. In this new one, I want only good things, and I do whatever I want that I can. 

Any time I have a decision, I will do what I want to do. This puts me on a good path, because I want only good things. Just think about this for a little bit. Any time you're met with a decision, do the best thing you can imagine to do. This will lead you to literally the best life you could possible imagine. Now, the only limits are your imagination. Expand them with education and discipline. Your expansion is limited, as is your life. But, your imagination can expand limitlessly. There is no cap, you can always expand it. I think the fact that I imagined creating the entire universe is proof enough, of that. I imagined it so vividly that I actually believed (and still believe!) that it actually happened. Regardless of whether or not it did happen, my imagination was powerful enough for me to accept it as truth. 

If you're confused, know that isn't my intention. I'm a little confused too. Perhaps last night I was delusional, and maybe I'm still feeling the after-effects. But, I'm pretty rooted in reality at the moment, and I can tell you that no matter what is true and false, I did not lie to you here. Not deliberately, and that's the only way that lies happen. 

You might think I'm delusional. That's alright, you are an internet stranger that has a very limited impact on me, just as my relation to you. Most people don't think I'm delusional, because I'm pretty familiar with inter-subjectivity and I've gotten pretty damn good at it. Regardless, we are all delusional. We live in our own worlds. Our own subjective reality, each and every one of us. If I wanted to, I could live in ecstasy. Total delusion. That isn't what I want, though. I don't think anybody wants to live in total delusion. I want to judge things as bad, so I can think myself good. I want to witness evil, so I can put a stop to it. I want to be corrupted, so that I can fix myself. I want to fall, so that I can get back up. I didn't make these decisions as a human, but I have accepted them as one. 

But, judging by the size of this comment, I can tell that inter-subjective reality is escaping me, and I'd like to return. So, I'll leave you with [this](https://soundcloud.com/temsik/wuarp/s-Que5z) for now."

philosophy,ffifdnm,t1_ffid4ui,1579972547.0,"Only if you strictly define love, but then it wouldn't be love. You could define love as good, but good isn't strictly defined either. There are many qualities you can use to describe it, but you can't define it strictly and accurately. It is formless. So without a strict definition of what love is, you can't really prove or disprove the idea that it will make you happier. Also, I sort of disagree. The particular reason would be that divinity is unfalsifiable. That's my belief anyway, if you think that divinity could be falsifiable I would love to hear how.

I'm actually not too familiar with his work. Correlations can be revealing, but I don't think they can falsify anything, right? I mean, aside from the idea that things aren't correlated. I'm still very new to this, so I might need some help to understand you better.

Want to be clear that I'm mostly speaking of divine experience, not revelation necessarily. I would say it defies the standard rules because normally you don't realize that you are literally God. You might think it, you might know it, but it's pretty rare to realize it consciously (even for those that know). Most people probably don't think it's possible. I've met a lot of 'aggressive agnostics' along the way. Divinity doesn't break reality, but it certainly bends it like very few other things do. Like imagine you went your whole life without any sound, and one day somebody told you that you could hear, and all of a sudden you could hear. That would certainly seem to break the rules of the reality you thought you knew, right? You didn't even conceive of the possibility before, but all of the sudden it's impossible to deny. You interacted with people by moving your mouth, and you understood some of other people's mouth movements. But, you had no idea that there was another channel for the movement besides sight. It's not as if you broke the rules by hearing, it's that you now have a better understanding of the rules. You've expanded your scope.

Most people don't understand that they create their reality. They do on a small scale, they understand that their actions influence what they perceive. They might know that sight, sound, etc, is a product of a process that is done by them, but it's sort of a hard gap to fill. Recursion is hard to understand. It includes infinity, which is paradoxical. 

Most of my divine experiences have come from drugs. One with LSD, most with DMT. I can think of two minor experiences void of substance, but they were definitely not of the same caliber. It's clear to me that divine experience of any caliber is possible with or without deliberate ingestion of these substances, but it appears it would take a lot of time, dedication, and discipline to get there. Drugs are a shortcut. It is often hard to accept things when you're given a choice."
philosophy,ffiab9g,t1_ffi7wxu,1579969101.0,"I guess so. Had to look up the definition as I sort of thought that meant fortune teller, but I absolutely agree that I’m a mystic to some extent. It does not dominate my life though, I’m usually pretty regular.

I agree with that, I discount my own divine revelations because they are too much for me to comprehend or analyze. The language that’s spoken to you is one you understand, not necessarily one you can deliberately recreate.

Mystics will never be able to propose something falsifiable. Prediction is incredibly easy, but ambiguous in nature. There’s a reason, though. Mystics do not try to guess what will happen, they realize what is happening. All of this, is happening. This is unfalsifiable, as I’m sure you know, proving that you don’t exist is a non-starter.

I can make a prediction. If you incorporate more love into your life, you will be happier overall. Love is the fabric that binds us, connects us. It is the only reason for connection between us subjects. But, this is ambiguous because you need the right kind of love. The purest form- self love- is incorruptible, you can never go wrong with it.

Definitely far from science, no question about that.

philosophy,ffi2szr,t1_ffheje6,1579963421.0,">can we classify ""strawberries are red"" (said by me) as a subjective fact without knowing whether ""I see strawberries as red"" (said by me) is an objective fact?

Yes. It may not be 100% accurate, but it's the best we've got to work with. I can't know what's objective to you, so I can only assume that what you act like you experience is what you experience. When you say strawberries are red, it is an assumption I make that you experience strawberries as red. Truly, it isn't a fact at all. But then, everything that I consider a fact, I must have experience with *first-hand*. That's very limiting, so I allow some trust. I trust that when you make this claim, it's based on your experience. 

Actually, maybe here again we should consider inter-subjective facts. I think this is a fitting example. While you may not actually perceive them as red, it is to the best of my information that you do, so I assume strawberries are red is an inter-subjective fact. Again though, these aren't *really* facts, they are more like weak beliefs. I weakly believe that you experience strawberries as red, based on the fact that you said they're red.

I don't think deliberately making the distinction is important, but perhaps it can be useful. I'd guess most of it is automatic. When my feet are cold, I don't need to question whether they are physically cold or I just feel them as cold. Either case, I want a blanket or some socks. But, when you try to be more objective, you throw yourself into a corner so that you can be more correct. Let's beef up the fact that I see strawberries as red, make it more objective. As it stands, it only works in a moment- when I'm seeing strawberries. What about unripened strawberries? What about jaundice? What if I go blind? A more objective fact would be ""I see strawberries as red right now"", or ""I think that I interpret most strawberries as red"", or ""when I imagine a strawberry, usually it is red"". But what does that tell you about strawberries? I'm not making any claims for others or assuming their position, or making any predictions. So it isn't really a fact about the inter-subjective idea of strawberries, it is a fact about my perception. It's more objective, therefore more 'correct', but it tells you less about the object. Sometimes, we tell more even though we don't know more. That's okay though, because we don't need to always be correct, and imagination is instrumental in a happy life.

This notion strays a bit from the literal definition of a fact. But, so do most of the ideas that we consider facts. Rather than trying to be 100% correct and throwing them all away, I'm trying to fit correctness into the model we already have. I'm not too concerned with facts, usually. Instead of separating what I take to be a fact as objective or subjective, I separate them as what I know or what I believe. Which is a little wrong, because most of what I 'know' in this case is just what I *believe* I know, but I digress.

There is one concept that is absolute truth, it is unity. Totality. Everything else, is less true. That's what's most important to me, it is a basis for living my life as I want to do so. Rather than seeing how things are separated, see why they are fundamentally united. It is always more true, regardless of overlying fact. Separation is an idea, it is imagined. Unity is truth, it is the most real. Democrats and republicans? They care about the future in this country. Rich and poor people? They let money control their lives. Subjective and objective facts? They're united in fallacy.

Truth comes before proof, comes before facts. It is more fundamental, in my opinion it's more important. Facts are something we impose on things. Truth is something that was here before. We can learn a lot more from truth than we can learn from facts- a lot faster, too. It's also a lot easier and less stressful than dealing with facts. 

It is beneficial to think of concepts like truth, greed, and facts as agencies of their own, void of us humans that employ them. What does truth want? What is greed after? What do facts do, ultimately?

philosophy,ffhm28r,t1_ffhdmj7,1579941735.0,"While I think panpsychism is *technically correct,* in that everything contains individual consciousness, I don't like it because of the verbiage. It seems like it's implying everything has a mind or awareness, which seems pretty far fetched. I consider consciousness ""this"", and everything is a little bit of it, some things *have* a little bit of it too. The idea is kind of between words, so sticking it to one is anchoring the idea whereas language evolves. I think pantheism does a pretty good job of avoiding that, though. Basically, God=Universe. The creator of totality, is totality. Totality contains everything, including it's creation. There are different totalities- totality of matter, of energy, of potential, of life, of humans, etc. But, there is also just totality. 

This is a very fundamental view, it is so bare it doesn't really tell you much of how things are or what to do. Regardless, I think it's important to start off on stable ground. I don't know where you stand with God, but allow me to assert you that it is fundamental to existence, and getting a more solid understanding of it can lead to some very insightful experiences. Some things are beyond words (underneath words might be a better definition). You can talk around them a lot, but you can't say experience into existence. But, you can experience the creation of experience. You might not be able to bring much to the analytical world, but you can witness a whole lot. If you ever feel like you want a little more out of life. If you get bored often. Consider God. Try to get an understanding of it. You don't need to be religious or go to church or read some books or anything like that. Search for truth, you will find it. Inward is never a wrong turn. I didn't think it existed, either. I found the entrance to the path about a year ago, I have been blessed ever since. I have had a few divine experiences too, starting maybe three months ago. Very revealing. It's like watching reality undress. FYI I'm not the only one doing that. There are different words for it, but it is actually somewhat common. You can hear it referenced in music **all the time,** and it doesn't usually go by the name God.

Unless you're telling me you aren't conscious, you're telling me you're in duality of mind and body.

3. This one twisted my brain a little, lol. I would consider it a subjective fact because you aren't including yourself as the subject. Therefore, ""I"" in this case doesn't mean you, as it does when you say ""I see strawberries as red"".

I dunno. ""I see strawberries as red"" is an objective fact to me, because I experience it. But when I say it to you, it is a subjective fact for you, because you don't know that I see them as red. But when you say it (assuming it is true), you cannot say that it is subjective- to you, it is objective. My objectivity will never be yours, and vice versa. 

But see, this would mean that anything you hear is subjective, and there is no objectivity. And, that's true, but it is **very** limiting- you'd miss out on a lot that life has to offer if you only took to be true, what you (think you) absolutely know is true.. So, let's consider a different category. Instead of claiming that something must be true regardless of a subject (which is an inane claim and a guess at best), we have inter-subjective 'facts' that can be assumed to be true based on our perception of other subjects. Say you see a bear, and everyone's running from it. It's reasonable to assume there is really a bear, so the bear's existence would be an intersubjective fact. Now, instead say you see a bear, and nobody is paying attention to it- but you really see it, you can feel it, it's moving, you can hear it's roar. It is a subjective fact that the bear exists. It is a fact nonetheless, you've proved it by touching the bear and hearing it. But, it isn't an inter-subjective fact, because based on your perception of other subjects, you can't assume it's real to them.

Depends on what you mean. They're experiencing the same thing- consciousness. But, consciousness manifests in different ways, so the experiences themselves will appear different. They're both watching a movie, but one might be watching Star Wars while the other is watching The Titanic. 

Both and neither. Reality is a world of facts. There are facts that exist subjectively, and objectively. I see a strawberry as red. From this, I posit the fact that ""Strawberries are red""- this is a subjective fact because they are red to me, but perhaps you see them as blue. Now, take the fact ""I see strawberries as red"". This is an objective fact, because I do see them as red whether or not you do too. An objective fact must include a subject. So, both people are experiencing a reality- a world of **subjective** facts. But, neither is experiencing the reality of **objective** facts.

Subjective reality is still reality, objective reality is still reality. But, in this case I think a better word for objective is ""intersubjective""- a consensus. What we consider objective reality is a consensus of things that are. This would include first-order qualities like position and size. Your subjective reality includes second-order qualities like color and sound."

Religion is about humans and how humans should act. God is the origin of existence, humans are a relatively new thing in the grand scheme of things. God has a lot more to do with space, matter, emotions, awareness, etc, than it does with some religion. God is the fundamental that religion is based on, **not** the other way around. 

For an analogy, I would say books have very little to do with art. Yes, they are a form of art, but they encompass a lot more than that. Education, exploitation, control, opinion, emotion- books encompass all of that and more, so reducing books to just art is a fallacy.

40 hours a week, almost six hours a day on average, to do whatever you want with. Course this usually isn't in a row, and that's why you use a planner. To figure out when you have free time, and plan what to do with it.

Do you live near snow? Snowboarding is great. Expensive to get in to (a few hundred at the least), and depending on your area passes might be expensive too.

It’s all in your mind, man. You are lucky, you are special, you are blessed. Find out how to realize that.

Maybe try some psychedelic drugs. Not casually, but look into it because they have some serious potential for curing/treating depression. 

I had a lot of social anxiety up until a few months ago. I still have a bit, but holy cow it’s like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. DMT taught me how to handle it. It has taught me a lot more, too. Let me rephrase that- DMT allowed me to teach myself what I needed to learn. 

It’s all your perspective. See, if you need to go to school to get a job to grind a 9-5 and then die, of course you will be depressed, that’s an incredibly depressive outlook. If instead you have an opportunity to gain knowledge and wisdom, surround yourself with like-minded people, learn how to make friends and talk to people and have conversations and just generally be more social, while doing things you love like biking, snowboarding, rock climbing- and you’re actually here doing it, it isn’t some sort of fantasy, and it’s going to lead you to a wealthy future... well hot damn, you are probably one of the top 10% luckiest people on the planet right now. Perspective is everything.

If you’re miserable in college, why tf are you doing it? Life isn’t about being happy in 20 years, life is about enjoying the eternal moment we exist in. That moment has no past or future, it is only, always, now. There will never be a point where you will be fulfilled and satisfied completely. You will die worn and incomplete. Accept this, and move on. Not telling you to quit college, telling you to seriously question why you’re here. Because you want money? Well why do you want money? To be secure and comfortable? Why do you want that? Just keep questioning until you know that you are where you should be.

I might get some flack for this- but fuck hope. Hope is one of the emptiest feelings, it is less than worthless. Quit hoping that you’ll get better and make it happen. If you keep hoping, you’re subscribing to the notion that things will just fix themselves by some stroke of luck. Do you really want to rely on luck? you don’t need to squander hope, but definitely don’t rely on it. 

Accept the fact that you will be depressed until you change that. Nobody else can do it for you. I’m not telling you to go find a therapist or medicate to try to fix yourself, I am telling you to accept yourself as you are. Think of it like an addiction. You can hope that eventually it will go away, but it won’t until you change things yourself. Much like addiction, emotions are cyclic. If you’re feeling negative, it is a lot easier for you to perceive things negatively, which will lead to more negative feelings. Compound your happiness and love, not your depression.

Quit struggling. Stop the resistance. You are rhythmic, use that to your advantage. We are creatures of routine, create positive routines for yourself that emphasize self-compassion and cessation of struggle. Do things that make you feel good, and then you will want to do more things that make you feel good. Start somewhere small and easy, work your way up. 

You are not a human trying. You are not a human doing. You are a human BEING. Just be. The rest, will fall into place. 

I recognize this monster of a comment is very abstract, so in case you didn’t gain much I’ll give you a few jumping off points that will allow you to form your life however the fuck you want it to be formed. Seriously, you do have that power, you have only yet to realize it. The only issue here is that your toolbox is vastly limited. If all you have is a hammer, everything is a nail. Good luck building a house like that. 

- Learn how to meditate. Download the Headspace app and try a 5 minute session. You don’t need to meditate all the time, you just need to know how to do it, and how it affects you. This will put another tool in your toolbox, in case you want to use it.

- Research psychedelic drugs and their effect on depression. This is one of (if not) the most powerful tools known to man kind, it’s kept like a secret because government is literally terrified of humans having this much power. I’m not joking. For a college student, DMT is probably best as the trip doesn’t last more than an hour. But, it’s also the most intense so starting elsewhere is generally advised.

- Look up actualized.org and watch his video about mastering emotions, as well as the one titled “what is god? A no bullshit explanation for smart people”. Yeah it might take four hours to watch these both, but what is four hours to the rest of your life? Don’t be greedy with your time, you have plenty of it. Don’t worry about wasting it, all time is wasted in the grand scheme of things.

Science is about empirical evidence, you can’t really prove anything with science, you can only say “there’s enough evidence to assume”. 

However, other methods allow for knowledge beyond belief. For example, you cannot scientifically prove that you exist, you can only provide enough evidence for it to be reasonable to assume that you do. By direct conscious experience though, you can know that you exist without needing to believe it. That’s the only path to knowledge, is direct conscious experience. Science leads to assumptions, reason leads to belief (these two are intertwined), direct conscious experience leads to knowledge.

Of course, even true knowledge is subjective; you cannot know that you exist if you remove the subject. By this path, one could claim that you can’t really know anything- but then, could you really know that? 

Anyway, I do have an answer to your question. Sentience leads to objective reality. Because objective reality is a consensus among subjects (and therefore does not exist objectively). Without sentience, there is no consensus. 

Consciousness is more fundamental than reality. You can prove this by altering your consciousness (typically via drugs), and experiencing a different reality. For an analogy, which comes first, gravity, or physical laws? I would say physical laws, because they are what informs gravity to exist. Without physical laws, you cannot have gravity. Without gravity, physical laws could exist, they would just be different. Gravity is a manifestation of physical laws, much like reality is a manifestation of consciousness.

If you’re worried about cost, it is probably about the same. Where I live, it’s actually quite a bit cheaper to not live in a frat."

college,feio718,t3_epchz8,1579143121.0,"Sit next to people. Don't avoid people. Take small steps. It will be uncomfortable at first, just because you're not used to it. You've gotta get out of your comfort zone to expand it. If you do those two things chances are somebody will talk to you. As this happens more often, you'll get more comfortable with it. Then you might be comfortable with talking to people a bit more.

Don't feel a need to rush into a relationship. If you're just generally more social, opportunities will arise. 

You will be forced into some group projects, probably. These make it very easy to talk to people and get acquainted with your peers.

Edit: just wanted to add that this is how I get by. I’ve got a friend or two, but mainly my social interactions are with random people. I’m not great at starting conversations, but that doesn’t burden me much. Either I’ll sit next to someone or they’ll sit next to me, half the time they will just start talking- specially if class doesn’t start for a few minutes. The trick is to be comfortably present. Don’t be on your phone or reading or listening to music if you want social interaction. Just be present. Seriously, people will talk to you if you’re just sitting there being present. My guess is they’d feel awkward sitting next to you silently if neither of you are engaging with something, but of course this doesn’t need to be and never is addressed- instead, they’ll just talk to you. 

I just discovered this recently, I’ve been pretty asocial most of my life. Today I sat next to a girl and she started talking to me, a conversation developed and eventually there was like 5 of us talking fluidly before the teacher walked in and started class. None of us knew each other, and I don’t think this would’ve happened if I had left a seat-gap or if I was scrolling reddit or something.

If you find it difficult to sit and ‘not do anything’, learn how to focus concentrated attention. To sight, sound, or simply being. It’s a kind of meditation- you could call it that, anyway. It’s very powerful, and will allow you to just be there comfortably without needing some other sort of stimuli."

Or, maybe he was already a kind person and you made him feel good. The only non-winner in this situation is your girl, and she got to witness her boy being a genuinely kind person who wants to help someone even though he gets nothing out of it. If I was her, I would be proud of you.

Don't see how you'd be cramming for exams if classes literally just started... I've been keeping up, though. I like to start my semesters off strong, regardless of how they end up. Yesterday I was assigned \~50 pages of reading and another homework assignment- did it all as soon as I got home. 

Procrastination is a weakness of mine, and I find that I waste a ton of time doing so. By getting everything out of the way ASAP, I almost completely eliminate the possibility of procrastination. Instead of wasting time before doing an assignment, I can just chill and relax while wasting time because I've already done my work. No stress."
college,fegt98q,t3_ep2kt3,1579102017.0,"Show up with a folder/notebook/binder for each class, as well as a few writing utencils. Personally, I bring my laptop too (in my backpack), but this is so I can study/do homework in the library without going back home. If you need it for a class, your professor will tell you in advance. 

Your professors will often tell you that books are required, and then literally never use them. I tried to keep up with the readings for my circuits class- almost everything I learned from the book we skipped over, and the readings were a few weeks ahead of the class, so it just wasn't very helpful at all. I just pirate my books now, and I'll do the readings for necessary classes (like most HU courses). Most professors will teach what is needed, and the textbook works as a reference. 90% of the time, taking notes will be sufficient. For this reason, I highly recommend you pirate your textbooks, else you will waste a ton of money.

Absolutely do not bring all of your textbooks to class, you will break your back. If you want to have them handy, keep a pdf version on your laptop."
college,fegsp98,t3_ep1or8,1579101645.0,"Yes, they definitely have healthy options wherever you go. Honestly, it isn't too hard to gauge whether a meal is healthy or not. It might be difficult to say ""this has x many calories"", but it should be obvious that stir fry is better for you than pizza. If you just choose meals that are healthy, you won't need to worry about gaining the wrong kind of weight, getting fat, or counting your calories. If it tastes rich and fatty, it's probably not great for you. If it tastes sort of subtle or bland, it's probably good for you. 

The trick is to take pleasure out of eating. Eating is for nutrition, not pleasure. If you make that distinction, you will have zero issues making healthy choices. You can get your pleasure somewhere else, where it won't adversely affect your health- you don't need it every time you eat. Jerk off more or something, I dunno. If you don't want to put junk in your body, don't."

All you need to do is demonstrate why you need this. Dorms are $4500/semester, it is totally reasonable that you can't afford that. All you need to do is prove it.

You could also tell them that you're moving in with a significant other. I wanted to live with my gf first year and they offered me an apartment in Daniel Heights, even though I was a freshman and under 21.

There is a merit waiver request form, you can find it through google pretty easily.

Even if you can't get around that, get outta there dude. It's great for people who can afford the convenience and don't mind living in a shared closet, but if you don't want to live there, don't. I don't know how much your merit scholarships are, mine was $750/semester. Even if I had to eat that cost, I would save almost $3k by living in a house that's a 10min walk away from campus."
