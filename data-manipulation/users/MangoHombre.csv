WhitePeopleTwitter,ffmp3k9,t1_ffml2h9,1580057412.0,"Does police come to your house with guns drawn to confirm you have car insurance? In Texas that's enforced by law, but somehow people don't get checked by armed forces. This isn't the apocalypse stop being so dramatic. Matter of fact in most states you could get jail time for not having insurance, but that doesn't mean they come to everyone's house with guns to check everyone, only those that have repeatedly avoided the fines and warnings. If you break a law and avoid going to court or paying the fines at one point police will get involved. If you don't give your child medical treatments like vaccines, to me that's abuse and should be a crime and treated the same way we treat DUIs or a lack of insurance.

Also what a douchebag way to phrase a question. How about I ask you a question?

Do you support abusing children by denying them medical technology like vaccines? Oh but don't explain yourself! answer with a yes or no."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffmjvk0,t1_ffmb9by,1580055706.0,"You guys make it more complicated than it needs to be. You call forced vaccination a human rights issue, but it's no different than the laws we already have stopping people from not wearing seatbelts or public nudity. I should have a right to walk naked in the streets because it's my body, but because others are affected it's  a crime. If I don't wear a seat belt I'd likely die in a crash, but even worse my mangled corpse could kill someone as I crash through the window. Charging people a large enough fine would handle most of the population and if that doesn't work then charge people like we do with DUIs. Somehow, someway, it needs to be illegal.

Also, ""taking away parental rights"" is such an exaggeration. You couldn't beat your child right? Could you abuse your child in any form? Not forcing vaccinations is putting the child at risk of disease and is therefore no different than abuse. At that point parental rights aren't relevant. You still control your child's growth and teaching."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fffvnsw,t1_fffstee,1579892801.0,Yeah that bit had me confused. City folk can't imagine moving away for a better life. They live in extremely population dense cities and wonder why jobs are so rare and rent is so high.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fffumw0,t3_etaeqo,1579892157.0,"The point isn't to move away from the city into the suburbs, but to move anywhere to find a better job or opportunity in general. Meaning maybe go to a different state. New York is expensive for example, and if you think the dickheads running our country will help you by lowering rent or raising the minimum wage, well enjoy living in misery. I've moved countries for better opportunities, it's worth it in my opinion.

WhitePeopleTwitter,ffcf2y4,t3_estfkx,1579798087.0,"The sarcasm doesn't really make sense. As a people, Americans have dramatically changed for the better. Although they need to improve, how they treat people now is infinitely better than how they treated people in the 1920s. Plus nobody will admit it but they're one of the most multicultural countries on Earth. I've lived in the US for 3 years after living almost my whole life in Canada and the people are very decent. They socialize with other races often and most friend groups are blended. In college it's pretty rare to see a group of friends without at least one minority. My neighbors are sweet people who helped me move in. How the media portrays the US is totally different than reality."

If the owner cared so much about the staff they'd pay them a living wage and fuck off. Tipping is one of the most idiotic systems in the US and Canada. It's annoying as hell and especially in bars the bartenders expect ludicrous tips. People that expect tips always bitch about how they need to survive but they'll never tip the poor bastards working at McDonalds.

There's lectures online and you could probably straight up just walk into a class and nobody will bat an eye. Ask a friend for access to their college class search and look up the rooms. Nobody will care. If there's an exam just say you got the wrong room and walk out. It'll save you thousands and you won't be tied down to deadlines.
