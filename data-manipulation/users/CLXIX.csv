This is the former speaker of the house, a high ranking politician making a political statement about the music he likes and naming a band whose entire purpose was to state a political message opposing his own ideals.

It was either intentional gaslighting on paul ryans part or he is culturally tone deaf given that context.

I cant even think of a hypothetical scenario thats more off the mark as far as political or cultural understanding.

It would be like Bernie Sanders being an Alex Jones fan and then being shocked to find out hes a prominent alt right figure. Thats not a good analogy because Alex Jones is the furthest thing from an artist. There is no scenario to serve a better example.
