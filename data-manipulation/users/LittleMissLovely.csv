TrueOffMyChest,ffcfdyk,t3_esni5j,1579798275.0,"I have 17 piercings, a vast majority of my body is tatted, and I have had fantasy hair for the past 10 years. 

I'm definitely the biggest baby. I have a huge heart and get stepped on a lot. I'm always protecting everyone and honest to a fault. A majority of the people I interact with daily are the same way. <3"
AmItheAsshole,ffcd3rb,t3_esjhx2,1579796862.0,"YTA - The amount of love it takes to foster (in most situations - not the horrible 'heard about it on TV' situations) is huge. Your mom opened her heart and home to these kids who NEED to be loved and accepted. If you exclude her, you're literally telling your mom that you dont respect her choice to foster, that what shes doing (which is HARDDDDD) doesn't deserve to be recognized, and that you will never accept any of the foster children. You're telling the foster child that shes not worth the attention while shes likely missing her blood family or struggling in ways that you could never imagine. 

You had a privilege that these children do not have. You never had to work through a system to feel some compassion and companionship. 

Your mom signed up to do this, she will be doing it a while. In 10 years, she will look back at the memory with the foster child and smile because she'll wonder how shes doing, etc. She wont be angry seeing someone that she opened her heart to. Don't abandon the foster child for your own hurt feelings."
