DebateAnAtheist,ffkxs71,t3_eu47cr,1580030898.0,"Honestly I wouldn’t say this indoctrination works because the Catholic Church is right. Any more than I’d say people in abusive relationships who can’t leave them suffer because their partner is right. Or people who suffer from deep psychological trauma after years of parental abuse do so because the parents were right. 

Morals are not objective. But they’re not*sub*jevtive either. In fact when religions talk about objective morals they’re actually asserting that their view is the only objective morality. In fact they are presenting **absolute** morality, only one form of objective morality. One could also list utilitarianism as an objective moral framework, and one not derived from a God. 

Anyway as I was saying, morality is neither subjective nor objective. It is *inter-subjective*. Think of it like money. You can’t say money is subjective. It’s an absurd idea to think that if you personally don’t believe in money it doesn’t exist. But it’s similarity absurd to think that rectangles if paper have the objective value of food. 

Rather it is a shared understanding, a collective agreement that gives money value. The same with morality. Collectively we agree (for the most part) what is and is not right, or is and is not acceptable. Most particularly we agree on the “rules”. We typically don’t care about behaviours with no victim. We typically care greatly about harm to innocents. We typically prefer non-intervention and personal choice over repression. What we count as a victim or harm or whatever is an ongoing internal discussion. 

If you want a nail in the coffin of religious absolute morality you just have to ask a simple question. What is it, and what is it drawn from? Religious absolute morality has justified slavery and genocide, and oppression of minorities especially by sexuality. But that has also changed over time. Interracial marriage was once immoral. Divorce used to be forbidden. These things have changed over time, changed **with** secular inter-subjective morality. 

A true and factual morality from on-high would not."

Carbon dating is not used for dating fossils. Different isotopes break down at different rates - half lives. You need isotopes that break down fast enough that they are detectably different, but not so fast that it would all be gone at the period you're talking about.

ethdev,fee4opt,t1_fedhbkr,1579026330.0,"I see this as an absolute win. Seriously, the ability to just... see what the state actually is... is hugely important for basic debugging. This will be a big help."
webdev,fedt5w7,t3_eogmq1,1579019350.0,"This is a really weird article. It's very obvious the author knows what they're doing, but they misrepresent a bunch of things really badly. For a start, let me say explicitly that I don't know what people were saying on Twitter, but it seems to me that `reduce` is in no way the appropriate choice here. It's specifically **returning an array**. Using `Array.map()` is definitely the right option here.

But! There are a few things ""wrong"" with the article that I want to address. First of all, the reduce option isn't particularly well optimised. You **could** simplify that slightly.

    .reduce((accumulator, line) => {
      let file = line.trim();
      
      if (!file) return accumulator;

      const destFile = getDestFile(file);
      const destFileDir = path.dirname(destFile);
      accumulator.push(`mkdir -p ""${destFileDir}"" && mv ""${file}"" ""${destFile}""`);
      return accumulator
    }, [])

This has the effect of flattening down the reduce block by simply returning early (returning the accumulator) if it's not valid.

That said, this leads to my biggest problem with the article. It's presenting a false dichotomy. Chaining or reduce? Why would you not use both? You can chain with `.reduce()` just as you can with `.map()`.

This makes the reduce option simpler still.

    .map(f => f.trim())
    .filter(Boolean)
    .reduce((accumulator, file) => {
      const destFile = getDestFile(file);
      const destFileDir = path.dirname(destFile);
      accumulator.push(`mkdir -p ""${destFileDir}"" && mv ""${file}"" ""${destFile}""`);
      return accumulator
    }, [])

Again it's more complicated than the `.map` equivalent, but I've already agreed that's better. Still this is a simpler version for reduce.

The last thing I'm faintly confused about is... why so many steps? It's possible that the way the thing is broken down has some necessity, like that in the real application the array is stored, or sent somewhere. But it seems strange to make an array simply to later loop through it.

I had a look at his actual code (not the one in the article, but linked to) and it shows this: 

    const files = execSync(`find ""${searchPath}"" -type f`)
      .toString()
      .split('\n')
      .map(f => f.trim())
      .filter(Boolean)
      .forEach(file => {
        const destFile = getDestFile(file)
        execSync(`mkdir -p ""${path.dirname(destFile)}""`)
        console.log(`mv ""${file}"" ""${destFile}""`)
        execSync(`mv ""${file}"" ""${destFile}""`)
      })

Which makes way more sense to me."

photography,fed1j3z,t1_fed0ra8,1578994015.0,"Yeah. I did want to say though. Despite my previous joke the EF-M drought isn’t *really* a personal issue to me. Like, there’s no specific lens I feel I would need or want that I can’t get. I have a super compact macro, a really nice f1.4 32mm prime, a standard kit lens I never bother carrying. I could possibly consider the 55-200mm tele though I never seem to use them. 

There isn’t really much of a wide-angle option afaik, and there are some more technical lenses like tilt-shifts that obviously aren’t an option. But for someone like me who only has/wants a few key lenses it hasn’t been a genuine problem. 

Also that video was really interesting. I haven’t finished watching it, but I did want to say, there is a fine line between brand loyalty and brand lock-in. I didn’t get a canon mirrorless because I love canon so much or because I think they make the best mirrorless. I got a canon mirrorless because I could use my wider range of oft-better EF lenses. I have a very good wide angle, for example, and a better macro lens with a better flash.
