You can get better, it's a time and effort taking process, you have to improve yourself gradually. Although it may not seem now but it really doesn't matter if the whole class laughed at you. This wasn't your fault at all. This is the way your body acts and you have very low control over it now. Practice deep breathing often and read some helping material or contact some therapist if you can afford. Lastly, don't worry, no one's perfect, everyone always has some shit which everyone can laugh about.
