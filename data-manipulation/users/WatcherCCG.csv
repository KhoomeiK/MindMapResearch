You are right though - Nintendo probably doesn't care about either of them. And in money terms, even as one of the bigwigs in the doujin market, they won't sell long-term. Plus even the Touhou community is markedly afraid of what could happen if Reimu/Marisa appearing in Smash brought the series into the mainstream."
smashbros,ff4dt1u,t1_ff3e368,1579561237.0,">It's my belief that some bigwig exec over at Ubisoft is cockblocking Sakurai's attempts at negotiation, and that Rayman has been considered for both Smash 4 and Ultimate. Rayman's spirit and the Altaïr and Rabbids Mii costumes are the only things Sakurai has been able to claw out of their death grip. This is more speculation on my part, but it still seems more likely to me than Sakurai simply considering the characters and deciding they aren't worth including, because Rayman and Assassin's Creed certainly have what it takes to get in.

This is roughly the same theory going around about Geno, actually. Sakurai's wanted to add him since Brawl, but keeps saying he can't make it a reality. That's almost certainly not because he doesn't have the potential for a great moveset - anyone claiming thus can look at Project M and kindly shut their mouth. The only other logical reason? Someone with authority over Geno's rights, and possibly the rights to SMRPG's music (DQ's main composer is known for being really temperamental, for example), is basically looking at Sakurai's offers and ideas, and point blank telling him no, because reasons. Not enough money in it, not wanting ""filthy gaijin westerners"" to touch their precious property, it could be anything. But someone has made a point to ensure that Geno never sees the light of day again."

smashbros,ff4argy,t1_ff4589r,1579559268.0,"My point exactly. They're greedy, stingy, and half the time can't even get their own musical staff to cooperate with them when it comes to licensing outside Japan. For example, Dragon Quest's Koichi Sugiyama is famously nationalist (even outright xenophobic in some respects) and hates it when his music is ported to the west, using his position on Japan's primary copyright board to block it when he can - he's the main reason the DQ8 remake on the 3DS had MIDI remixes instead of the original score outside Japan, and I suspect he also put his foot down on Sakurai when he was asked for music to put in Ultimate. He does *not* like foreigners. Look him up."

smashbros,ff3z8nt,t1_ff2dv7j,1579552092.0,"Geno. For me, Geno would literally be the final character I'd actively request for Smash, everyone else would be gravy. But I'm realistic. Geno is a one-note character whose popularity is largely here in the west, and our opinions are very secondary to that of the home market. Plus we know Sakurai wanted Geno for Brawl, but seemingly gave up on it, likely due to being told no. Whether Nintendo didn't want to deal with Square's licensing quagmire, or Square refused to play ball because they only care about putting FF and DQ reps into Smash, he was denied. I reckon the answer was the same both times if he tried again for 4 and Ultimate. Geno would sell, don't get me wrong, but he makes no long-term profit. And long-term profit is the goal of the Fighters Passes."
