GYM,ffi7m69,t3_etpn66,1579967195.0,"depends on how desperately you need it, saw can help if you find two legs too many for you, guaranteed weight loss.jokes aside there is no magical pill, eat healthy, count calories (myfitnesspal etc) and be in calorie deficit and keep at it."
AmItheAsshole,ffc01jw,t1_ffbzqsu,1579788034.0,"its actually the opposite, they do not have to possess those devices at all, it is just for the convenience sake (unless otherwise dictated by law).   
it sucks it didnt work, but shit happens."
Fitness,ffablfo,t1_ffa3qv7,1579731712.0,i really recommend tracking calories cause sometimes you feel like you are eating enough but you just arent. e.g. myfitnesspal or sth like that.
Fitness,ff9zx7y,t1_ff9z01j,1579725071.0,"it sounds like ankle mobility issue to me, especially the falling backwards on bw squat.   
you can try elevating your heel a bit / get lifting shoes and see if it helps, although investing in improving ankle mobility is probably better long-term."

unpopularkpopopinions,fdd6jv3,t1_fdcl7xp,1578297012.0,"i can understand the last point. But I dont think that people who are belittling other based on their hairstyle have an issue with the hairstyle per say, they are just looking for a reason to dismiss them and use hairstyles as an excuse. What I mean is that if you wanna be racist you will find a way.   
Therefore talking about CA is just not addressing the main issue. I am pretty sure there is a lot of racist people in the world, no matter what skin colour or nationality or ethnicity they are.  


 But those people are hard to change as they will find a reason to hate regardless of what we do.   
My point is, while you can change view of some of those people,it should not be our main focus(because it is usually something someone has to find out on their own)therefore in my opinion building intercultural relationships is way better in the long run than trying to isolate the cultures."
unpopularkpopopinions,fdatllg,t3_ekgjpf,1578249976.0,"CA is almost US exclusive anyway, at least I had never heard of it before i visited kpop reddit tbh, I am from Europe.   
I understand being angry when someone is belittling other cultures - like that mask of sorn´s friend. But insulting someone over hairstyle is imo ridiculous. As long as its not harming anyone or encouraging violence/racism etc.   
you should let people do what they want, wear what they want to wear etc. I mean i know some people who are doing Latin dances and never heard a complaint about CA for that."

tumblr,fd5gqi5,t1_fcz5qf3,1578177447.0,should be fine. as a treat.
AmItheAsshole,fd1tqx4,t3_ejvceu,1578136683.0,"while your motives for this are a bit questionable (hard to think you dont want to punish the guy a bit) it all depends on what kinds of messages they were exchanging. if they were sending nudes or something among those lines then sure, she should probably know. only you know how serious it was.   


also do you have any proof of this? or is this just going to be based on your words?   
Either way in a longer run its better for you to let it go, it is not going to improve anything for you IMO, i mean what is the best case, they break up? how does that help you?    


Also NTA for telling him that, you are free to do that, but without any evidence she will most likely not believe you."

hearthstone,fcv71ht,t3_ej1rbu,1577995974.0,"I think it is a bit too weak, my suggestion is to make hero power cost 1 and give frozen minion +1/+1, and even then it is decent at most and not as good as rafaam, deryl, edwin etc. ,arguably worse than sindragosa as the +1/+1 only really matters in early game, but freezing only 1 minion might be useful later on so that is not so clear.  
3/5"
AmItheAsshole,fcutuom,t3_eiydga,1577988374.0,NTA. One of the cases where you are technically not an asshole but your chances to have a good relationship with your colleagues are basically gone.
