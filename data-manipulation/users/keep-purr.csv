Christian faith literally hinges on the truth of the Bible, and these scientists have shown the viability of literal 6 day creation and young earth
.
I challenge you to refute those specific points from that article 

It’s hard to believe that there were infinite accidents that happened just to lead to a Big Bang, we have no evidence of how a star or planet forms. How have we not seen this happen one time with all of our view into space? How can you explain the bending of the rock layers? How can you explain the addition of DNA to create new life and new traits when there is an irreducible complexity to just about every organelle of every organism? How can you explain the survival of dinosaur blood, tissue, DNA, and other things for over “60 million years” when in fact there is no way for those to survive for more than 100k years? Where are ANY fossils of missing links in the geological record? Why are there different eras of fossils in different time layers that should not be there? There are actually more holes in the theory of evolution that creation.

It comes down to faith either way, if anything you have to have MORE FAITH that there were literally trillions of accidents to happen just right to get where we are. The mathematical probability alone should give scientists pause about the theory of evolution"
