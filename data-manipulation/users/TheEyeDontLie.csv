We knew the apocalcapse was coming. Everyone did. For years the storms had been getting worse, and each summer the fires grew in ferocity. Never like this, though. We weren't prepared. I still don't know what we could have done to prepare.  

I was in my shed when it all began. I was whittling a figurine. I loved the texture of wood, being connected to nature. Man's dominance over the world. This is my dead peice of tree, and I shall shape it in my image. There's something instinctive about it. Playing God.    

My wife was in the city when the first fire came. She was at work. She's an accountant at some big firm. Mary's always been a hard worker. They didn't even need her that day, turns out the smoke had evacuated her building. That first fire should have been a warning to us. We laughed it off. One town over got a bit damaged, but it's little more than a handful of farms. Nobody died. We all had insurance. We'd thought we'd fine.   

I'm more of a country bloke than my wife. Always have been. That's why we compromised and bought our new house out here in the wops. Our first house had been destroyed about ten years ago. Asbestos. We'd had to move and the bastards had destroyed our home, just cos it had asbestos in it. Fucking beaurocracy. I smoked cigarettes, why should I worry about asbestos?  

 We'd moved our here, and brought our garden with us. It was a beautiful garden. Our fucking pride and joy. We didn't have kids, although we'd thought about it. Mary had had a couple of miscarriages, and they'd put us off the idea of officially trying. That's a blessing, really. I can't imagine having lost my kids too.   

I miss her hair the most. Waking up to it's soft smell. Finding bobby pins in my t-shirts. The sixteen different bottles of shampoo and whatnot she used, each with it's own unique aroma... It's warmth. I miss the warmth of Mary's hair the most.  

Now everything just smells like smoke. No fruity shampoos. No sweet perfumes. No buttery toast and cheap coffee on a Sunday morning. Just grey smoke. The doctors say I seared my respiratory system, like a fucking snag on a barbie. I shouldn't be alive, they say. They're right. She should be here, not me.   

I'm sure you all heard the news. Your have seen flickering images of leaping flames and towers of smoke. Infernos. Whole fucking pastures and swaths of bush on fire, and some homes toasted. We were right there. We saw it all. But there was nothing we could do. We just listening to the news, paid attention to the warnings, and tried keep our normal lives going. Mary had gone to work yesterday too. I hadn't even kissed her goodbye. I wish she'd stayed there.     


I got my first warning when I got out of the shower. My phone beeped, and told me to stay alert. There were fires in my area, and I needed to ""watch and act"".  

 What bullshit. They might as well have said ""say your prayers, and maybe it'll go away"". I watched, and I acted. My car was already loaded with essentials, and we had bags ready to grab of our important documents and valuables. I was just looking for Bizzo, our terrier, when my phone buzzed again. ""It is too late to leave"".   

That's when I knew shit was bad.   



""Bizzo!"" I screamed, ""Come here ya little rat bastard!""  

That fucking pup. He better get inside soon.  

Looking out towards the hill, the sky was dark and bloody. Concentrated sunset smothered the valley, but it was only 3pm. Fuck. As I watched, I saw the first flames. The fires flickered over the ridge, silently jumping into my land, into my world. My mouth hung open. My eyes stung, but I couldn't blink. It was hypnotic. Astounding. Almost beautiful. The terror and panic took a few moments to register.   

Bizzo almost knocked me over when he charged in the door, and something inside me snapped. I spun inside, the mesh door banging behind me. Water, I thought, I need water. I rushed over to the sink and started rubbing the tap, searching for a hose. I don't know what I was thinking. No hoses in the kitchen. I'd taken two steps back towards the door before I realized my garden hose wouldn't make a difference anyway. I was coughing now. The flames were already sparkling on the windows. Everything else was dark. The fucking dog wouldn't stop barking. I couldn't think.   

The next few minutes kind of just happened to me. I don't remember thinking about it. Not exactly. I remember closing my doors and windows, blocking them with wet towels, or putting Bizzo in the bathroom, but I don't remember planning it or questioning my actions at the time. It was just the thing I was doing. I didn't know why. Things were done. I don't know how my body did it while my mind was elsewhere. Someplace bland and happy. I knew what I was doing, and I did it. There wasn't time to think.   

I was violently coughing when I finally got in the bathtub with Bizzo. He'd gone quiet. That was the scariest part: he'd stopped fighting. Bizzo curled up under the blankets with me, silently shaking. Damn dog didn't even flinch when I turned the shower on. He cuddled against me under the layers of wool, and the water rained down, slowly soaking us while we stared into each others eyes.

Chefs complain about kids these days being soft, but it's wonderful. The culture of kitchens is becoming safer and friendlier, and that's delightful to see.  

Self abuse used to be a bragging right for chefs: ""I worked 85 hours this week, did a 19hour straight double yesterday with no meals, just had 8 coffees, half a slice of bread, and a few shots of whiskey.  You're a pussy if you did less than that. You doing exercise? You poof. Smoke some dope instead. I fucking chopped off a finger and kept working. You pansy, wanting a bandaid"".

To create is to change something into something new through your actions.   

 Eurasian, especially European, people  lived in crowded towns with shitty sewage systems, and animals living alongside them. This created the perfect environment for mutations to spread in disease bacteria or viruses.   

 When something has mutated enough, it counts as a new thing. Dogs are not the same as wolves. Humans created dogs. They didn't grab a wolf and cut his legs off and squish it and paint it to create a pugdog, but you'd still say they created it.   

The conditions of the filthy, crowded Europeans created new strains of disease, and when a disease strain changes enough, especially when it jumps to a different host animal (like from pigs to humans) it's usually counted as a new disease.  

So, Europeans created new diseases *through their actions*, wether they were planning to, or not.   

If you let monkeys and ducks and toddlers into your house, and lock the doors and windows for a week, YOU CREATED A MESS. Sure, it was the animals that smashed things, but it was your fucking actions that did it.

 Don't mix drugs, especially alcohol. Know your dose- and use a tiny dose of anything new. Be aware of set and setting. Use clean equipment. Stay hydrated. Eat a healthy diet and look after your sleep. Don't overdo it, and take breaks from usage. Be aware of your limits. Make every second drink non-alcoholic. Watch yourself for warning signs of dependency, addiction, or just general bad behavior (using when you said you wouldn't, skipping class to get high or whatever). Be extra careful using any drugs until your brain has fully developed (24yo). Always use protection. Try have a sober friend around at all times, and listen to them. Don't make any phone calls or txt messages until you've sobered up. Try using less harmful methods of use (eg. eating rather than smoking or injecting). Wear sunscreen. Research how particular drugs work in your body/brain, and how they interact with stuff. Learn how long they last, the negative side effects, and how to deal with overdoses or bad trips. Keep on partying, but be responsible."

Also, while a few of the poverty stricken, corrupt, developing nations do have higher gun violence than USA, they don't have the problem with mass shootings. That's like a champion able-bodied sportsman losing at the Paralympics.   

It's partly due to the lack of access to assualt rifles and shit, except for organized crime, military and police (often all the same), and partly because they don't televise and encourage, glorify, and provide media circuses for that sort of behavior.

ACAB=ALL COPPERS ARE BASTARDS  

It's a rallying cry and common graffiti slogan of the poor, the punk, and anarchists. The phrase became popular in the UK skinhead scene (before the racists hijacked the skinhead movement) in the UK in the 70s, at a turbulent time when entire towns were losing their jobs because coal mines were shutting, and shit like that. The cops were protecting the scabs that crossed the picket lines to keep businesses open during union strikes. The cops were arresting people of color. The cops were doing what cops always do- protect the wealthy, the white, and the status quo. The skinhead movement, and punk, was all inclusive of people no matter their skin color or whatever, and were obviously violently against this institutionalised corruption. It was like nineteen ninety seven when I learnt about this, but is true to the best of my knowledge. The history of punk is very interesting.    

The only times I tagged a police station and a cop car I wrote ""Corruption"" and ""Respect is Mutual"".  

 ""ACAB"" is a bit old-fashioned, and I don't believe they're all bad. Just the institution as a whole. When the revolution comes, let's hope they don't ""just follow orders""."

You have adventures. Then you're getting older, but now you can't seem to find girlfriends anymore. You're not even getting laid as much. You've lost your mojo, baby.

You're lonely, and your looks are going. Your crazy antics aren't as funny anymore. Women your age are looking for careers and houses, and you spent all your money gallavanting around the world, making stories and having adventures. They're not interested in you.

You open Reddit. You read about people's happy relationships. You're reminded of bobby pins. Happy families. It's been so long since you woke with a face full of soft smelling hair, and hot skin touching yours. Too long since you gave someone a hug and they grabbed your ass. An aeon since you scrabbled around on the floor of the bathroom, picking up the six dozen products you knocked off the sink. Your sink is bare. Your shower has a bar of nice soap and some dandruff shampoo. The plant you used to brighten up the place is dying.   

You drink your liqueur spiked coffee, and you start to write. You write in the third person, pretending your mistakes and self doubt belong to someone else. You try not to feel too lonely.
