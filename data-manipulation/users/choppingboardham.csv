A note: when interviewing be absolutely honest about your excel skills. Never say you are proficient if you can't do it all with ease. If you struggle with VLOOKUP but can do it, say that you need more practice at that skill. I can VLOOKUP, but my current position hasn't warranted it's use in 2 years. I told them, ""I can do it, but because I havent used it in some time, I may need a quick refresher.""
