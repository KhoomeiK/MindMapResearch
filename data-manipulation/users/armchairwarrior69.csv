Then when her mom finds you and sets you up on the sofa she... burst into the house and started screaming at you? As in... she was out at that time in her hometown area on Christmas after kicking you out at 1am and returned home later than that after BEGGING to go there this year? 

I dont want to say anything but... you might want to find out where she was going in that situation and... who she was with. 

Qlso, how the fuck have you flaccid spined your way into not getting an explanation about this for over 2 months? Come on. Your lack of self respect to not get any explanation or apology for this is bananas. 

I'm not saying she was cheating and I hate going there when it isnt explicitly obvious but these things all together give me a lot of reason to be concerned about that. 


But also, this woman sounds insane no matter what. If you want to even try to continue this relationship you are going to get an explanation about every single aspect of this situation and get an apology. And then you're going to have to see that she gets psychological help. 

But honestly, this is all way past the ""dealbreaker"" line for 99% of people. I get that you're young and this is a long term relationship so you can make a million and one excuses as yo why you're relationship has ""otherwise been great"" but there are so many red flags here that you may just be in a relationship with Soviet Russia.

Also, since when was an activist who gets the chance to tell leaders ""cut the shit. You'll be dead before this matters. I wont. Fuck yourself. Listen to the science and do something you corporate butt sluts"" a bad thing? 

It's not the same but are we going to make fun of Martin Luther king? I mean, there were certainly more people speaking out about black rights before his speech got peoples attention.

This is stupid, frankly. You need to talk to him and explain just how ridiculous it is. Its 100% his issue and not yours.

I honestly think at that age it's going to be a crazy uphill battle to get change out of him on this. My honest advice is you try to tall it out. If he has even an ounce of pushback I think you'll have your answer as to whether its worth it to work on this. Think about it, do you really feel like convincing him that his behaviour is atrocious is a good sign? I dont. If it goes well you make him get himself into therapy. If that's not viable, then you need to realize that this guy has issues and isnt in a place to even attempt to work on them. That means he isnt ready for a serious relationship at all. It would probably be best if you explained yourself thoroughly and broke up with him. Best for him because if he is a decent guy he can probably try to learn from this and make some fundamental changes.

My point is, she needs to take proactive measures to keep her depression in check. That means not burning herself out with a ridiculous workload, that means seeing a therapist and making an honest effort to get the most out of it as she can, that means trying medication and sticking with it even if it makes her uncomfortable and that means not blaming you for the fact that shes allowed herself to spiral completely out of control.

relationship_advice,femkidf,t3_epq87n,1579260146.0,"I think you guys need to sort that out and you need to realize that excitement shouldn't overtake the logic of getting to know what living together is like before you sign a contract to do it forever. That's kind of stupid dude. It's in te same level of silly as ""let's have a baby to fix our relationship"" it just makes no sense if you think about it for more than 4 seconds, especially at 21.

That being said, living at home to avoid racking up thousands and thousands of dollars in additional debt is also the best logical situation. You guys seem to have some communication issues and hell, priority issues and are 21. Dont put yourself in a deeper hole of debt to accommodate your girlfriend at 21."

Call the police and notify her family if possible. This guy is a literal monster and she is in actual danger if this is the kind or shit hes trying to pull"
relationship_advice,femk6ew,t1_feld0rq,1579259703.0,"Something a few friends and I learned... you cant stop people from being stupid and making life changes going horrible decisions if that's what they really want. You can try but in reality people like this are lost and more than they'd like to admit, willfully ignorant."
todayilearned,femjsu0,t3_eppa70,1579259186.0,Honestly... that seems pretty reasonable if you ask me. Not donating your organs when you ARE DEAD is selfish as fuck and you shouldn't be able to benefit from others doing it if you arent willing to as much as those who are donors.

relationship_advice,fehfs77,t3_ep3vfe,1579115636.0,"You fiance sounds like an adult spoiled brat. 300k is waaaaaaaay above average and shes expecting you to just get to that to accommodate her?

AskMen,feeq0l6,t3_eolsp9,1579038785.0,"Stopped thinking of every girl as a potential notch in the belt. It's amazing how many women seem to be interested in sex and initiate it themselves when they dont feel like theres pressure or anything like that.

I've never really had a super hard time necessarily but that seemed to really Male a difference. 

Ps: sex is better when the girl actually WANTS it instead of being convinced or whatever you want to call it. That was my big discovery of young adulthood"
