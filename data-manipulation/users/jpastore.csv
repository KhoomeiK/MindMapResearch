Your parenting doesn't determine outcome. I quit school at 14, 4 months into my freshman year. I've been a successful entrepreneur for the 20+years following that. I'm 4 types of engineer (software, network, systems, and telecom) and I school degree holders. I grew up in witness relocation, my father kidnapped me from my mother to save me from a life of those she and her family was involved with. He left me with an apathetic bitch step mother while working to support us. He died when I was 21 after I moved out at 18. I do very well for myself. He was minimally involved from a parental stand point but definitely contributed to how I think. 

Your style of parenting doesn't guarantee anything except how you feel and shouldn't interfere with how others grow out lead their lives. Hence if they're legally allowed to determine if they are ready to fuck, they should be legally allowed to determine their options thereafter. Yes I'm a parent."

Prisons shouldn't be private in my opinion, but no matter how you slice it prisoners =$$$ for someone. So laws are created to create more prisoners. Remove CCA and the ability to profit from prison labor (rebranded slavery), things will get a lot better. 

I think Portugal did the right thing by decriminalizing all drugs and treating it like a health issue instead of a crime. Drugs won the war on drugs. Bolivia kicked out the DEA and their problems were significantly reduced. Many countries in South and central America are tired of fighting this war. I lived in Peru for a couple years. They call the CIA the cocaine import agency. Take away the profits from the war, it'll evaporate. Attack the bankers for laundering the drug money and it'll cease to be easily converted. No one went to jail for the $10b in cartel HSBC got to float their mortgage platform. They paid $2b in fines. When the fine are a mere fraction of the profits, it's a vig to a larger cartel we call government.
