Which is why the poor little guy is triggered when you say that to him. Ah well... Only a matter of time before the truth is revealed once again. Scum never lasts long."

I believe in the power of the mind, you don't have to. And ""it's all in your head"" as a reasoning is hilarious, considering most of life practically happens in your mind. 

>None of them feel your ""positive vibes"" because sending energy is not a thing. Your thoughts aren't changing that. If you actually care then donate some money or something instead of just saying things to make yourselves feel better about a tragedy that's actually affecting alot of people.

Do you know what I have done and haven't? I actually donated what I could this morning. I never once said energy alone is a fix. 

You may get further by not being a jerk.  You just wasted a whole lot of time and energy attempting to change my beliefs for some sad reason. You may want to ask yourself why you feel the need to do that. This actually ended up being really sad on your part."

By the way, THIS was your original ""question"". Not what my method is. I could have answered that easily ten comments ago if you had actually asked that. Peace brother."
spirituality,fdbr5x8,t1_fdbmarm,1578260641.0,"I don't recall you asking how I personally do it, only asking me to prove something to you which you already don't believe and are clearly set in stone on. 

Positive ""vibes"" are energy, just like we are, just like everything else around us is. And energy is controlled by thought, language, movement, intention, visualization, among other things. So I personally do it with three ""top"" things in mind: intention, feeling, and visualization.

Others have other methods, and considering energy is ""invisible"", it is physically and mentally impossible to 'prove' this to anyone, especially when they tend to lean more on the close minded side. 

You have been all over this thread all day challenging every single person on their perspective, why is that? What is it you are trying to achieve? You clearly stated this is nonsense, so why ask? Just to argue? That's where I find your comments completely useless. I would challenge myself instead. Just as I am right now, attempting to communicate something to you when there is clearly an interference in the communication and we aren't seeing eye to eye. 

Even if someone does believe this, why is it bothering you so much? If you don't believe in it at all, that means that it can do no harm, so why invest this energy into it? If someone is at least TRYING to do something, and cares, you shouldn't be knocking them down, you should be supporting them. And you are clearly not here to do that. 

I'm not here to argue, never was, I've been trying to just offer my perspective. I have no problem admitting I'm not a great communicator - I'm not.. Yet anyway. English is my second language, and I just struggle with communication in general, which is why I say I am surely learning something from this. 

With that said, I'm bowing out of this ""conversation"" as you clearly just want to argue and not actually gain or offer anything from it, other than possibly some sense of false self  confidence and security."

spirituality,fdbby4k,t1_fdb904w,1578255889.0,"That's not what you asked. You asked me to ""prove it"", which is literally impossible, especially considering the fact I already said it is an opinion and difference in perception. You didn't ask what my personal ""method"" of doing so is. But hey, if you say so man. 

Nobody knows anything for sure in this world, only what's true in their own mind and heart. I know enough to know I know nothing at all. That is why I do my best to learn from every experience and encounter I have in life. Every person and every experience is a teacher. If that's sad to you, cool, it's not to me.

spirituality,fdahxxr,t1_fdaglgf,1578246294.0,"Read my comment again. There's a difference between the conscious and subconscious mind. Do some reading. Seriously. If you actually want to learn. Which it doesn't really sound like you do, since you are attempting to elicit emotion out of others in order to get your point across. 

I would not know what your subconscious mind knows, which is why I'm not answering the question, it's an impossible question to answer, for one because everyone's minds and internal maps are different, and also the obvious- I cannot see into your mind. But you can.  Which is why you already have an answer and a belief set in your mind before I even give my opinion or say anything at all. But as I said if you are open to it, you could learn a lot from this. I know I am! So thank you for that, if anything."

spirituality,fda4hcg,t1_fda34hn,1578241527.0,"believe I worded that wrong, my apologies - Different perceptions of reality*, it's still the ""same reality"" technically, though those are very fickle words. But everyone sees it differently based on their belief systems, experiences, and many other factors. I can only extend a ""hand"" from my end, it's up to the other person whether they take it or not, based on their structure and perception, as well as how in tune they are. The subconscious mind (which is in charge of almost everything we do), is what determines that in every human being and why it manifests differently. 

However, many don't even know how to access the subconscious mind (consciously), so nope there is absolutely no way that I can say for certain they will ""receive"" it or not. Because their perceptions (just like mine and yours) may be different."
