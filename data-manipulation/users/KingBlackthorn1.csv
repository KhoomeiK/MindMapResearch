Damnthatsinteresting,ffzkh0g,t3_evv5ci,1580383548.0,I really want that
instantkarma,ffz809s,t1_ffyeyms,1580366841.0,I mean it’s not that hard to believe that every child has different tastebuds. I love dark chocolate as a kid (still do) and have always hated milk chocolate.
intermittentfasting,ffz32ww,t3_evwkkk,1580362357.0,All progress is something. Doesn’t matter if it’s one pound or a hundred pounds.
AmItheAsshole,ffyhl65,t3_evqd98,1580346609.0,NTA. I would love to see a picture of these hoodies though. They sound awesome
relationship_advice,ffy4ijr,t1_ffqxnum,1580338396.0,What is runescape? I know it’s a video game but I’ve never tried but I hear lots about it
AskMen,ffy3mnn,t3_evq7ce,1580337917.0,"I think less toxic masculinity. The funny thing is my mom was a single mom but literally all 4 of us got toxic masculinity from her because she always tried to be strong and never show her emotions to us. And we took that too. 

Also for my mom to teach us about health more. She kind of just ignored our health."
AskMen,ffy2uyj,t3_evn29c,1580337506.0,Turn on: men with hot legs and in athletic socks. This all started with when I watched my first gay porn lol. It’s been my ongoing fetish
AskReddit,ffy1xuu,t1_ffwzfhs,1580336971.0,This. I love Ariana grande but fine love every song of hers
AskReddit,ffxnt6j,t1_ffwvk7a,1580328901.0,I agree however you can’t just ignore the pain you caused with the way you thought. Calling someone out on the stuff they won’t did or said is just fine but the person not acknowledging what they said and not giving a genuine apology. Kevin Hart was the worst in my opinion. He didn’t care that he said it and went so far as to se he wouldn’t apologize. The only reason he eventually did was because he got so much heat. He was sorry he got caught not sorry for what he said
Warframe,ffvyk3w,t3_ev96nt,1580277326.0,Yes x10000
Warframe,ffvyif3,t3_ev686h,1580277279.0,I have no friends to show the game to. One day I’ll have someone who has never played it lol
ShitMomGroupsSay,ffvsjk3,t1_fffiuuj,1580272024.0,Vick’s is a miracles worker. Could be the Latinx I’m me but my family is used Vick’s for everything lol.
CatastrophicFailure,ffvptsi,t1_ffvoxrv,1580269946.0,Okay that makes sense. I kind of forget kids and teens of the 80s were not so connected to the news and such as we are now. I feel if this happened now it would be a shocker but not a big deal because of the stuff we have seen on the news and such now.
CatastrophicFailure,ffvdp5l,t3_ev3ve6,1580261696.0,Was this really a big deal? This isn’t me being mean I just wasn’t around then so I don’t know. I was watching the show Mixedish and they did an episode on this and the reactions when it blew up was like people just saw their parents or child die.
unpopularopinion,ffvdhd4,t1_ffvd64z,1580261548.0,I have but I really don’t like the texture at all. I do enjoy cornflakes a little but honestly still rather just not. I think it’s also the milk too. I don’t chewing food while also having a liquid in my mouth. But it is more the flavors because I love soup which is just the same thing
memeframe,ffuzotn,t3_ev9u35,1580252436.0,I don’t play harrow even though I love him because I find I can literally never take advantage of his stuff besides his ult.
AskReddit,ffuxhqc,t3_ev5zdg,1580251215.0,I cried a couple days ago because I’ve just been so stressed and a lot of my mental health issues are coming back. But it was light crying. The last time I cried cried was probably when my mom had a stroke in 5th grade. Haven’t cried cried like that in a while.
memeframe,ffs98oa,t3_eumhni,1580176248.0,I literally always until like 10-20% lol
AskReddit,ffpz7wz,t3_euawng,1580111962.0,"If they say they are anti vax or if they are racist, sexist, or any sort of hate. Luckily being gay means it’s rare you run into any of that but still it happens occasionally  my"
