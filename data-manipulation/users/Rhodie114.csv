Games,ffs9wqf,t3_eupqum,1580176704.0,"I gotta agree. Metroidvania isn't a primary descriptor of a game. If somebody totally out of the loop asked me what kind of game Ori is, I'd say it's a 2D platformer. It's a metroidvania too, but that's a less important categorization. The first genre that matters is the once that describes the mechanics. Ori's a platformer, Guacamelee is a brawler, and Yoku's Island Express is a pinball game. 

Metroidvania is the same kind of descriptor as Roguelike imo (also coincidentally named for an iconic early game of its kind). It tells players in the know a lot about how the core gameplay will serve the game at large, but it doesn't fundamentally tell you what kind of game it is. FTL is a roguelike. But just because somebody loved FTL doesn't necessarily mean you should recommend they play Dead Cells or Binding of Isaac. All those games exist in different genres.

It almost makes more sense to call classifications like Metroidvania and Roguelike ""metagenres"" or ""supergenres"" instead of ""subgenres"". A subgenre puts a finer point on where inside the larger genre the game lies. 4X is a subgenre of Strategy, and all 4X games will be strategy games by necessity. But all metroidvanias are not necessarily of the same broader genre. You could conceivably have a metroidvania title that's 100% platforming with no enemies, andother that's 100% combat with no platforming, and a third that is 100% dialog driven."

Dishes have been piling up in the sink. That's like entry level slob stuff. But we have a dishwasher. This is the first place I've lived that's had a dishwasher since I lived with my parents. It's SO FUCKING EASY to do the dishes now, just literally run them under the sink for a second and put them in the magic dish box. Well, it was easy when he was at home anyway. Now you can't run shit under the sink because it's our newest garbage terrarium. He also complains that the dish washer doesn't work, because it can't clean off food that's been allowed to harden on for days. 

What really gets me is that after cooking, he'll leave his food on the stove. That's where leftovers go for him, in whatever pot he cooked them in, right on the stove. They'll sit there for days if you don't move them. He cooked fajitas friday night that were still on the stove when I left for work this morning. I finally told him to put his left overs away so our place can stop smelling like a restaurant after the rapture, and was delighted when I got home to see that he listened. I open the fridge to get started on dinner, and see that everybody elses food has been moved around. Stuff falls out of the overloaded door shelves, and the produce and meat drawers and bulging out with all the food crammed into them. That's because he had to move things to make space for the dirty THREE GALLON STOCK POT full of rice and beans I'd asked him to put away. And to be clear, it's not 3 gallons of food. It's maybe a medium tupperware worth of food. But he just couldn't be assed to remove it from the pot it was cooked in. The top shelf of the fridge is also home to an uncovered skillet full of days old chicken, peppers, and onions. 

To be fair though, he probably didn't have time to move them to new containers. He needed all that time to go shopping for groceries that he opted to leave out covering 3/4 of our very limited counter space instead of putting away in a cupboard.

PoliticalDiscussion,ffm7okq,t3_etbq3p,1580049911.0,"No, because I have no faith that the “right” foods would get taxed. You have to know that which foods got taxed would become a political bargaining chip. People would try to lower tax on corn, dairy, pork, and beef to shore up support in rural America. It also seems inevitable that the tax would select for staples of marginalized groups who lack the political power to fight back. 

Besides, “healthy foods” isn’t really the biggest issue with dietary health. You don’t become unhealthy because you ate an unhealthy food, you become unhealthy because you ate an unhealthy diet. A huge part of that is moderation and portion control. I’ve seen it too many times where people replace the unhealthy foods in their diet with healthy alternatives, but keep gaining weight because their diet hasn’t changed much. Oat meal and milk might be better than Lucky Charms, but it’s not doing you many favors if you start your day with 800 calories worth of it. 

What I’d rather see is a tax credit in exchange for regular checkups and preventative medicine. Firstly, it doesn’t single out any one group. People hate being singled out for their weight, lifestyle, etc. This sidesteps that fight. It also means you can defer costs of a lot of chronic diseases that aren’t obesity related, such as COPD. Finally, it give people a better chance at actually beating obesity. Most people who fail to lose weight do so because they only know the hardest possible method of doing it. “Stop eating everything you like and be constantly hungry” does make sure you’re running a caloric deficit, but nobody sticks to that for long. A dietician can draw up a plan for people that actually isn’t that hard to follow."

I was worried going into it that I wouldn't like the new wild encounter system, but everybody said it wasn't that bad. Turns out it wasn't actively bad, but it was still boring as hell. It takes the most frustrating part of the old wild encounters (stuffing a pokemon into a ball) and makes it the sole way to level your party outside of trainer battles. I knew as I was playing that I didn't need to be grinding like that, but I can't help myself in an RPG. I don't like the feeling of leaving XP on the table. And ideally, the gameplay should actually be fun.

But I still would have enjoyed the game if that had been my only issue with it. The biggest problem I had was accessibility. I do maybe 75% of my playing in docked mode with a pro controller. Not being able to use the perfectly functional hadnheld control scheme while playing docked was a huge pain in the ass. If I wanted to play Lets Go, I'd have to get up and detach one of my joycons.

My gripe is less that the tactics don't make sense and more that the results of actions don't make sense. The most egregious was the Wildling army getting surrounded and pinned up against a mountain of corpses. It was a neat spectacle, but it just didn't feel real. You don't see the mountain of corpses get made until they're already backed up against it (probably because those don't occur naturally unless people are fighting on each other's shoulders). You don't see Ramsay's forces successfully flank the Northmen. You just see the very very tail end. The show goes from the forces being evenly matched to one side clearly losing without showing how it got there. It was like if you watched the Battle of Helms Deep, but cut out the scene where the walls are breached. You jump straight from the forces of man holding strong to them being routed and retreating to the inner keep.

The problem is, the show hasn't done any of that legwork. Sansa gets treated like an inferior for the brief time she's with LF. That is, when he's not selling her off to be a sex slave for literally no reason. 

That's the broader problem with the show's writing. It decided on using the same general endings as the book, but didn't take the necessary steps to get there. We can see Dany embracing her role as a tyrant in Meereen, especially when she gives the Shavepate carte blanche to torture persons of interest to combat the Sons of the Harpy. The show didn't want to do that, but still wanted to use the ""evil dany"" ending. I wouldn't be surprised in the least if Bran becomes King in the books too, but I imagine it will have a lot more to do with Bloodraven's past and a desire to have a more concrete influence over Westeros.

Boomers would just spin the results to confirm their arguments that younger generations are making worse choices. We're getting worse jobs because we're not as smart, or picked the wrong field. Our rent is too high because we're picking the wrong places to live, and are bad at budgeting. 

Instead, make the Boomer go back and work the first job they had out of college, and make them go live in the first house/apartment they had. BUT, they get paid what a new hire in that position would get paid today, and they have to pay whatever the current rent/mortgage is on their housing."
NintendoSwitch,ffaots1,t3_esgfrt,1579740995.0,"If a boss seems too hard, and isn't immediately in your only path of progress, then leave and come back later. There are loads of optional bosses in the game. Even the required bosses give you a ton of leeway as to what order you tackle them in. If somebody keeps kicking your ass, you might just be missing a certain charm that makes the fight way easier. Just make sure you actually do come back later, because optional bosses are usually guarding something good. 

When you hear crying, there's a grub in a jar nearby. Break the jar to free him. You'll then be able to collect rewards from the Grub Father in the upper left of the Forgotten Crossroads. Finding grubs is definitely worth your time. 

Keep an eye out for switches and breakable walls as you explore. Plenty of areas require you to take a long, challenging path to access them the first time, but then let you open up a shortcut to make future visits quick and easy. 

Certain upgrades should be bought the second you have enough money for them. Notably, a region's map, the quill, and Stag stations. You will be using them all nonstop for the rest of your playthrough as you navigate Hollownest. 

Practice combat on common enemies as you explore. A lot of them are easy to avoid, but you'll benefit from the experience. Not only will it net you a decent amount of geo, but it'll also prepare you for nearby bosses. Their attacks and movements are usually beefed up versions of their local enemies'. If you've carved your way through 50 of those enemies on the way there, you'll have a pretty good idea of when to dash away and when to move in and attack. 

In particular, learn how to downstrike effectively. It's tricky to get the timing just right, but it's hugely beneficial to be able to do it correctly. Plenty of enemies have no way of attacking you while you're above them, and the recoil from the attack can be used to get to places you otherwise wouldn't have had access to. 

Use the map markers to point out areas where you think you need a new ability to progress. Try to use different color markers for whether you think you need to jump a little higher, dash, or bounce off a wall. This will make backtracking *way* easier when you finally unlock a new ability.

If a required boss keeps wrecking you, try a new charm loadout. I can't tell you how many times I got rolled by a boss, only to clean them up once I swapped Gathering Swarm and Wayward Compass for something useful in combat."

My prediction is that her opposition to conventional Vorinism is a huge problem in parts 1 and 2. After that, the world learns about what happened at Aharietiam, that the Heralds lied to and betrayed humanity. They learn that the Heralds have been living among them, and have been doing basically nothing for the good of mankind. Maybe they even get one of the more lucid Heralds like Nalan to confirm that the Almighty is dead. At that point, either Vorinism turns to the Stormfather and the Radiants, or it eats itself."

I worked in a hospital during one of the seasons, and it seemed like at least half the patients who came in Monday wanted to talk about what happened last episode. When a season was airing, it was like your local team was playing in the Superbowl every week for 2 months straight. That ending was so shit, I almost never hear it brought up in person any more. It hasn't even been a year, and it's already like that show just vanished off the face of the earth. 

I can't even fathom the lost potential that represents. With the stranglehold GoT had on pop culture, it could have done a whole lot more than just spawn a couple spin-offs.
