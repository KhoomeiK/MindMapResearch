LivestreamFail,ffhu1xo,t1_ffgxc95,1579953893.0,Which really does say something because they have all the hard core analytics of viewerbase and numbers. Meaning it wasn't worth for them to bid as much as Youtube did. Could show that the game is actually dying and isn't just a meme.
AskReddit,ffhna0q,t1_ffh1ui5,1579943571.0,I think you'd get better results if you kept all the dumbasses that think it's my team vs your team when it comes to politics on the same earth. Then put all the independents on another earth.

AskReddit,ff6rc1h,t1_ff3ukw7,1579633259.0,When I worked retail my manager and I were like the polar opposite of you two. If the price wasn't too drastic I just gave it to them rather than back up the line waiting for a price check. My manager on the other hand didn't have a problem being a huge asshole to customers. It was pretty great actually.

Games,ff2iqsf,t3_er9fz5,1579507936.0,"What The Golf, was one of my favorite games I played last year. It's short and has a very refreshing gameplay style that sort of reminds me of Warioware. I rarely finish games but I 100% this."
Games,ff2fchi,t1_fetjheg,1579503771.0,Probably when the game gets fully released. It's technically still in beta.
Games,ff2f2dj,t1_fen1hfv,1579503450.0,Why wouldn't they just release as previously intended and then continue to work on the next gen console version? This would also ensure the bonus sales of people buying it twice if they get a new console.

AskReddit,fel4ev9,t1_fekhjwd,1579213824.0,We got really lucky with weapons with powers that combo'd off each other. So by the end game we were barely taking damage.
AskReddit,fekfuqo,t1_fek2hen,1579199169.0,"My buddies and I beat the game with the base classes. We were on medium difficulty. Had one mage, a tank, and a ranger. Are strat was the ranger having a slow, and then the mage having a reset ability. It made it so the enemies could rarely ever attack. Then the tank would obliterate them with his OP strength weapon."
AskReddit,fekffiz,t1_fek09by,1579198916.0,Me and my buds just won are first campaign after a few months playing on and off. That was on medium difficulty. I'm not sure anything harder would even be possible.

Games,fecqzdt,t1_fealbvd,1578981363.0,That's just MOBA players in general my dude. Leagues been out since 2009 and is still going insanely strong. It's also been the biggest Esport for at least the last 6 years. They're anything but bad developers. Now in terms of office culture that's a whole other story.
Games,fecpjxx,t1_fe2pddy,1578980048.0,I just beat the game 30 mins ago and thought it was alright. >!Darth Vader's!< introduction was pretty dope. Just wish the commercials and advertising for the game didn't spoil it. Would have made the reveal ten times better. I found the combat pretty tedious after awhile and the puzzles to be pretty lame. They were either super easy or so drawn out that you just wanted to get back into combat. The worlds themselves looked fantastic but the level design was so damn confusing on some of them. Like right on the beginning world I got stuck for 20 mins trying to get back to the ship and just kept looping around. Overall I thought it was a good first attempt at a modern day single player StarWars game. 3.4/5

AskReddit,febdcjm,t1_fea7gwr,1578957645.0,The college I went to gave out these really shitty RFID cards that would fade after a month in your wallet. They never replaced them and the cost was $20 for a new one. So by the end of my last year it was just a card with no legiable writing or picture.
Games,fe4hxs5,t3_enlwhz,1578859518.0,"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker used to always be one of my favorites. Now that it's optimized down to an hour it's a lot less fun to watch, because they just warp everywhere."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fe0zlk6,t3_en4r2x,1578820805.0,The animation in this episode was fantastic though I'm not gonna lie and say this fight was great. I honestly think the Noumu/All Might fight is still the best of the series. In terms of feel and emotion. It's looking like the fight may continue next episode so there's still hope.
