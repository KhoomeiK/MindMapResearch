DecidingToBeBetter,ffv86us,t1_ffv71e6,1580257993.0,Yeah I’m pretty much just gonna take the first adult job I can get. I’m sooooo tired of working with teens.
DecidingToBeBetter,ffuehsh,t1_ffu2r57,1580240266.0,"wow that's pretty cool!

What area of business did you go into and what kind of job did you get?"
humanresources,ffrakk7,t1_ffhiaxu,1580154038.0,Is recruitment not a good career to go into?
utdallas,ffr9ob0,t3_euh3o9,1580153482.0,"Is it possible for you to take a break while you figure out your career plan? You'll have more time to focus on your career options and you won't have to waste time/money taking classes you're not interested in.

Also, if you're ever feeling really stressed/depressed, please go to the SSB and talk to a counselor.

Hope everything works out, man!"

AskMen,ffe8hyj,t1_ffdtg64,1579839589.0,"Yeah the service industry can be nice, but its kinda toxic (from my exp). Majority of my coworkers are druggies and theres a lot of drama going on. I feel like I;m back in high school."
AskMen,ffe8ak0,t1_ffe3080,1579839422.0,wow thats really cool. What did you study?
AskMen,ffdnvnb,t1_ffdjlio,1579824870.0,"Good for you man! Yeah this thread is really motivating me to go back. I thought bartending would be okay to make a living. 

I mean I think I can because I make $300 - $500 a night, but man this job really kills me at the end of the night."
AskMen,ffditxh,t1_ffd3fqw,1579821780.0,What were you doing before you went back?

FreeCompliments,ff6lv3p,t3_erssfg,1579629970.0,lol you're still young so you still have time to get better at making decisions.  I'm 26 and I've worked with multiple people who are in their 30's-40's who still have trouble making good decisions.
AskReddit,ff3lagn,t3_erfy47,1579543464.0,"When I was a kid, I was really into WWE. 

Since I didn't have any brothers, I would practice my WWE moves on my pillows. I'm surprised that I never got injured because I was always getting on  top of my dresser and doing frog splashes on all the pillows in the house. 

Hahaha good times"

careerguidance,feh9qg1,t3_ep4d64,1579112082.0,"For now, call center or warehouse jobs are gonna be his best. Only problem is that a lot of those jobs will be gone in the a few years. I'm kinda shocked that he was able to get  a job at Starbucks. Most face to face jobs force their employees to look somewhat nice."

CasualConversation,fdo0dew,t1_fdnz9bh,1578596517.0,"Yeah I've been thinking about learning a new skill, but I'm not sure what to learn. I've worked in retail and restaurant jobs all my life and I really want to get out of that industry. An office job sounds nice. I just don't know what to study to get an office job."
DecidingToBeBetter,fcsxavx,t1_fcslzl3,1577927454.0,"I would always feel like apathetic loser after jerking off. I thought it was because I was using porn to jerk off, but even when I would jerk off w/o porn, I would still feel like a loser."
DecidingToBeBetter,fcsthhx,t1_fcsrrq1,1577924691.0,"lmao no I don't have a partner. I'm still waiting for my ""super powers"" to kick in. 

I think its a combination of Religion, the shame of being an adult and still jerking off, and also that one cooming meme that has pretty much stopped me from jerking off. 

I still get urges like all the time. Like I woke up this morning wanting to jerk off. Thats why I still watch porn from time to time. But once I'm watching a video, I'll just become disgusted with myself and just close out."
DecidingToBeBetter,fcrs9px,t1_fcrqt1y,1577905939.0,"Hey thank you!

Ohhhh yeah I'm well aware of those ""extinction bursts"". I would get them during bad times. Almost had one when I was at the store this morning haha."

Some of your professors **MIGHT** be okay with it, but its gonna be hard to play catch up once you come back."
