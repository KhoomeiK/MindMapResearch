That's the way my parents do it. The chickens (and ducks) are their pets. The eggs are extra.

My sister lives with my parents, and she can raise the best behaved chickens ever. I like visiting because the chickens will just follow you around the yard being curious. If you extend an arm, they will jump up to perch on it and you can pet them."

When I was 19 I paid almost a month's wages when our dog got ill. I hurt really bad because we were in a bad situation and I was working to help my mom pay the bills. I couldn't do it that month, which meant everyone in the home suffered as we had to scale back the thermostat, limit gas/electricity usage, shop more frugal than usual and just went to bare basics of survival.

Nowadays I am better off. I don't have a dog but I have a cat. And I would easily throw away $3000 if it meant her surviving, even if I had to put it on credit. She is amazing, relies and trusts me to look after her. If I wouldn't do everything I could for her, why would I have adopted her?

They applied for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but just before that we stopped getting stock in. It got so bad we were removing tags on shelves and expanding what little stock we still had to cover the face of the shelf.

For example, I was working automotive. Motor oil was a quick mover, but some sold better than others. Eventually I only had one brand of oil left, but not enough to fill the shelves, so my oil shelves were filled with only one brand of oil, not all viscosities and only 1 quart bottles deep, if I could even fill a hole. It was sad.

So many customers would come in and not find the product they were after. And I heard the comment ""No wonder y'all going out of business"" a dozen times an hour. Every one of them snickered as they said it, like they were original.

I have always been a cat lover. When I was a young teen my brother was driving me somewhere and we hit a cat at night. It ran away, but no doubt was mortally injured. My brother wouldn't stop.

To this day, I have been lucky. Over 15 years driving, and the only animal I ever hit was a rabbit, while on my motorcycle on a country road cresting a hill. I turned around, it was killed instantly. I moved it to the shoulder, and in a stupid way I felt so bad, told it I was sorry but let nature take its course (we have turkey vultures here who have to eat too).

I went back home, where my family was having a bbq with friends. And a family friend made a joke when I shared my story saying ""Should have brought it back!"".

I know animals get killed on the road. And to be honest, that bunny had it coming as it ran into the road, out of the road, then back into the road while I was trying to stop. Poor stupid bunny :( I still feel bad, and this is 10 years later.

Truman made comment about having many more, which was false at the time, but we were working to make them which could have been weeks to a month before a third would be ready. The surrender was based on the bluff of Truman and our fictional stockpile.

In truth we just really wanted to end the war before a land invasion of mainland Japan would need to be done, which would have ended with a lot of fatalities on both sides. Japanese families were already planning on commiting suicide and killing their kids if that happened, as a form of protecting them from atrocities. As the propaganda was telling them americans would murder their parents and rape the kids. Which kind of makes sense, as that was what Japan was doing earlier when they invaded China."

So you decided to pretend I said someone shouldnt own a vehicle? I am not exactly well off myself now, and for sure was poor as fuck when I got my first car.

Wanna know how to make a car last? saving money in the long run? Proper maintenance. If you are saving dimes, you likely are not running synthetic oil either I assume. And running over the mileage intervals to boot. The low cost oil you are running is gumming up quicker than synthetic, and not replacing the oil filter will cause less oil to run throughout the engine.

Can you afford to replace an engine? Probably not since you are trying to save on oil filters. You saved maybe $100 in oil filters through a long run of being cheap, but end up with an engine that became oil starved and died prematurely and would cost a thousand to fix.

There is the old adage ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"". That also applies to maintenance of your car. If your cars are dying left and right while being cheap. You are not getting sold lemons, your cheapness is killing your cars."
