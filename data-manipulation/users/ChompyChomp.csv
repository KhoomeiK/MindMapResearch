From conception to birth is usually close to ten months. Nine months isn’t out of the question, as gestation if humans varies a lot, but it also just illustrates the point that “exactly nine months” is a silly thing to use as a metric for when conception happened. 

(I’m not arguing with OP or trying to contradict anything, just replying to add to the conversation)

Edit: apparently I’m wrong, pregnancy is exactly nine calendar months."
