Monk,fepb4ip,t1_fep12h2,1579316232.0,It’s great and Tony Shaloub is SO GOOD. It curbs my sadness that there’s no more Monk.
AskReddit,fe03l0w,t1_fdz2xq8,1578802203.0,And this is why I proposed to my husband!
somethingimade,fdu634p,t3_en12lg,1578728215.0,"As a peds OT, I approve!! This is great!"
YouOnLifetime,fdquk0i,t1_fdpudi2,1578675137.0,Oooh thank you! We were wrong haha
YouOnLifetime,fdpmwgn,t3_elijpe,1578633187.0,This is Ellendale by USC right? My friends and I were all convinced that’s where they filmed it!
USC,fdck0fh,t1_fdcck23,1578276808.0,Ditto to that last part. We exist and need to stick together!
movies,fd9zup4,t1_fd82etd,1578240027.0,Please watch John Mulaney and the Sack Lunch Bunch. Or even just the last 10 minutes. I fell in love with Jake all over again.
smallboobproblems,fcz7fij,t1_fcwfquf,1578095194.0,I personally use sticky boobs for all of my dresses! Strapless bras are suuuuuuch a pain.
USC,fcz4x35,t1_fcyxuby,1578093738.0,"The quidditch team no longer exists but when it did, we made our best friendships. Almost my entire wedding party (both sides) was comprised of that team from college. I second going to the rev sports fair!"
ChildrenFallingOver,fct4m5g,t3_eimdl0,1577932746.0,"Honestly she did better than my friend did her first time. At age 27, she couldn’t stand up on her board and fell immediately every time. This girl killed it!"
OccupationalTherapy,fcl9100,t1_fcl09w1,1577742430.0,"Thank you! Oh damn, SF? Then you are plenty aware of the struggle. Do you feel like you have a good handle on yours? The only reason I feel like I can afford living here and paying loans is because I’m married and the dual income helps."
OccupationalTherapy,fcl8w7h,t1_fckqym2,1577742345.0,"It’s completely up to you and how you need to study. I personally don’t care for prep classes, and spent a month studying every day using my prep book and taking those mock exams to see where my deficits were and going back and studying more in those areas. If you don’t want that kind of pressure to apply beforehand you absolutely don’t need to do that. But it gave me a good idea of what was out there and what people were looking for and that might be of some use to you :)"
OccupationalTherapy,fcknvyx,t1_fckeee1,1577729396.0,"It’s going. It’s been going—I’ve been in repayment for just over 5 years now and I’ve still got a bit to go. My minimum payments cost as much as my half of the rent in the Bay Area (I moved here from SoCal 3.5 years ago), if that gives you any idea. :( but that’s because I went to private school for my undergrad and grad, so I’m quite literally paying the price."
OccupationalTherapy,fcknnkm,t1_fcjjgpg,1577729249.0,"It actually wasn’t! It was a peds job I found at the OT fair my grad school put on. I had given them my contact info/resume, and a date when I’d be planning on taking the NBCOT and therefore available to work—that was just before my final level 2 placement. I reached out again towards the end and set up an interview a couple of weeks before the test."
OccupationalTherapy,fcjhp1d,t3_ehgreq,1577688000.0,I got a job in SoCal before I even passed the NBCOT—obviously it was contingent on my passing. But it lined up nicely that it was only a few miles from my home (I moved back in with my family for a year after grad school so I could start to figure out the plan of attack for my loans)
todayilearned,fcj5x0t,t1_fcik5fa,1577678056.0,I'm so sorry. I completely feel you and am in the same boat with lost ties.
todayilearned,fch3nvq,t1_fcgnjby,1577646948.0,I’ll have to go looking next time I’m there visiting family!!
todayilearned,fcgi8k0,t1_fcdzxdf,1577640281.0,"Wow that is crazy! I say let her stay a witch, that sounds much more badass."
todayilearned,fcghpxr,t1_fcfjxbq,1577640175.0,Biix a beel?
todayilearned,fcghea4,t1_fcebng5,1577640044.0,"Sure! Now I don’t know fully how to spell them since they were all taught to me over just talking. 

But there’s: chokow pol (crazy), mix (cat), pec (dog), ic (spicy), box (black), xic (armpit), sac (white), Nicté (flower), tolok (iguana), biix a beel (how are you?). There’s definitely a trend that these are words she taught to me as a child haha."
todayilearned,fcgg5gm,t1_fcd7fh8,1577639638.0,"Amazing. I’m trying to get more into hot sauce and one of the few I’ve managed to like so far is a Yucatán-inspired one (meaning it’s not directly from there, sadly, but it uses those flavors as a guide) but mine definitely doesn’t have cool phrases on there!"
todayilearned,fcgfuc0,t1_fce6ps0,1577639523.0,Hahaha I know right? But my actual name is Mayan for ‘flower’
todayilearned,fcd2utt,t1_fccj9f4,1577605671.0,"Yep, my dad’s side of the family is from Yucatán and has some Mayan roots (despite them looking white as hell—gotta love those conquistador genes...) and my paternal grandmother used to be decently fluid in Mayan. My name is Mayan though and she managed to teach me a couple of words!"
HisDarkMaterialsHBO,fcahi0h,t1_fca4x1w,1577569338.0,It’s my favorite series of all time and my husband splurged and got me the Folio editions for my birthday this year in anticipation of the show and they are SO worth it. And now he gets to read them for the first time after I finish re-reading each one!
SanJose,fc9qek3,t3_egjczn,1577556626.0,You get a free shot of tequila on your birthday at Hash House!
HisDarkMaterialsHBO,fc9pbhr,t1_fc7vj2z,1577556131.0,"Balls, really? I must have been explaining other things to my MIL during that. The joys of watching it with non-book readers haha"
HisDarkMaterialsHBO,fc3ali7,t1_fc29ed3,1577385489.0,"Maybe I missed it. But to my knowledge, we know will is already looking for his dad. That his dad is John Parry. But it wasn’t until this finale that the magisterium said our loud “Grumman has a son” and that’s the moment most people will probably put it together since the only “son” would have to be Will"
hisdarkmaterials,fc25g9b,t3_efnhie,1577341248.0,Yessss I got the folio set for my birthday last month and they are incredible! Enjoy!
