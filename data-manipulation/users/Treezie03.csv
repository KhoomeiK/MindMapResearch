AskReddit,fele2go,t1_fek0lf3,1579219999.0,"I have an interesting example. I did the thing where we would pull up to a fast food drive through and I’d be humming and hawing and my husband would slowly lose his mind. 

I’ll explain what was happening in my brain and how I fixed it. I’d pull up to the sign and immediately I’d think ‘I’m going to regret this and feel terrible after eating anything here. Because it’s unhealthy, because there’s societal pressure to be thin, and I could be thin if I’d just stop eating this junk. But I’m hungry and we are on a road trip and when will I have another option to find food. Maybe there’s a healthy option. Oh Jesus, there is a chicken salad but I bet it is shit. The lettuce probably has those red/brown edges that tells you the food has expired. What I really want is a cheeseburger and fries but fuck I shouldn’t eat that. Oh there’s a chicken burger’

“Ok I’ll have the chicken burger, crispy” “with fries”

The way I fixed it was, I told everyone who cared that I don’t eat fast food and I carry tons of healthy snacks in my car. And 3or 4 times a year when I feel like eating a cheeseburger with fries I order the damn cheeseburger with fries and I enjoy every bite.

Edit: I tried to find the Dan Savage article about almost your exact situation but couldn’t so I’m going to do my best to bring up some valid points. As much as this pains you, and you likely feel deeply about how your dad is being treated, it’s worth taking a breathe and asking yourself some questions

1. What is the state of your parents sexual relationship? What if it’s been 3 years since they last had sex? Would you sympathize with your mom a little if so?

2. What if your dad cannot or doesn’t want to have sex? Everything from impotence to asexuality to intimacy issues, do you really want to force your parents to discuss these things?

3. What if your dad knows? Everything from fetish to polyamory, monogamish to swinging, or your dad simply giving her permission, do you really want to force your parents to discuss these things?

4. What if your mom isn’t safe after you tell. Is your dad abusive or controlling toward her? I’m not implying anything here. It’s a sad truth that many people are in this situation, unfortunately.

2. The roof needs extensive work. 
3. The tenant had the opportunity to submit a proposal
4. The city has it stated in the RFP that the next tenant has to have a 2 day/week farmers market component

There will still be a farmers market in the same building after the roof is fixed. The city just wants the area used to its full potential during the week. This is a good thing for the local developers. It will have more stuff happening nearby.

Why the last tenant didn’t see this as an opportunity to grow is beyond me. I’m going to try to support the artisans at their new location but honestly I don’t see myself driving out toward the airport very often.
