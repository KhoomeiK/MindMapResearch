UnsentLetters,ffteww3,t1_fftb26y,1580218564.0,"No, I raised in religious home. Was forced into going to church 3 times a week, went to a Christian school. Had devotions forced fed me every night.

I made the mistake when was 4 years old asking questions to my mother about religion. She yelled at me for asking. After that she quit showing me any affection or good attention. I was never told I was loved. I was never told I was worth anything. 

As a child I spent hours in a make-believe world of my own where I was alone because I felt more alone in my family then actually being alone. All because I questioned my mother's religion, when I was 4. I can't even describe the depth of pain I felt as a child. Because my mother and her religion. 

My mother didn't care about my future. She told me that god would come back before I turned 18 and all the believers will have their head chopped for believing. She never prepared us for college, because that would never happen. Because ""god"".

So I grew up in religious home alright. I grew up believing I was worthless, unworthy of love and totally unprepared for an actual future."
exchristian,fftdhwx,t3_euxf47,1580217317.0,"I was raised by a mother who very much zealously believed in Christianity. I was forced to go three to a Pentecostal (hellfire and brimstone) three times a week, I went to Christian school. My parents forced fed us devotions we were really young.

Guilt for not believing was thrown around constantly. The fear of not ""being right with god"" 110% of the time was pushed by my mother.  

I tried to believe but it just didn't feel ""right"". Something in the back of my mind kept bothering me. I drove myself crazy! My mind would whisper at me ""you know this stuff isn't real, why are trying to believe it?""


And I just eventually gave up sometime in my teens. And my mind was my own again. I felt the peace that was entirely lacking when I tried to believe. Just the relief from cognitive dissonance was enough.

They blame my for not having Dr. Pepper. They blame for polices corporate put in place. They blame me for not reading the debit card reader when it says ""please wait for cashier"" and they have to use their card again. 

This is what I want people to know :

Only corporate can changes prices and policies. 

I have no control over prices. Being mean to me won't change that.  Even telling the people you are with that our prices are high within in earshot of me isn't going to do a thing to change the prices.

I have no contact with corporate. I have as little contact with corporate as you do. 

I don't like the prices either. I make $10.00 and hour. Most that money goes to corporate.I wouldn't by our stuff if I had to pay full price. I don't blame you for not liking the prices. I feel bad our prices our so high. 

I don't like the fact we only refill large pop, popcorn and Icees. We are not allowed to refill anything smaller.  We have cameras on us, doing so could get us in trouble.

Don't ask cashiers to use their club membership on you. We just a few cashiers fired for doing that. Corporate records transactions. Corporate knows.

Everything on our registers are run on software, which is P.O.S. Point of sale. It is a software program. I cannot change anything in the program. That job belongs to software developers. We have a pre-set options with pre-set prices. I cannot give you an option that is not available. That includes changing prices.

We have pre-packaged nacho that come from a vendor. This vendor is from I have no idea where. And me, being a $10.00 an hour have no contact with said vendor. I have no control how many chips come in that bag. If I did contact that vendor and complain, management would look at it as going over their heads, I would lose my job.

We get treated like crap everyday. One coworker lost her grandfather. She couldn't skip work because she needed the money. She was grieving that loss when someone yelled her over the prices, which she has no control over. 

We are just human. We need the money and jobs are hard to come by. We take what we can get. We have feelings, we have families, we have lives outside work.

And then don't get me started on the to two customers who started going on about how slow the line was  (we had lines backed up to the door!) It's not my fault they come late to a packed movie on the first day it's out!

And the poor ushers having to clean up a whole shaker of cheese powder and popcorn that was all over the floor? Ugh.

But at the end of my day, after the shift was over (I was 15 minutes getting out, and that is only because my manager took my drawer when I still had a line and then someone else took over). A former coworker bought her service dog with her, and the dog approached whining to be pet, which the owner didn't have a problem with. Made my day a little better."

Anyway. One thing I learned, all people of all ages and all generations can be nice people, or they can be bitter, angry people.

Everything depends and how much empathy and self-awareness a person has, which can very different from to person."
TrueOffMyChest,fep80ui,t1_femzz0y,1579314205.0,"Where I'm from there is a major myth that cyclists can't on the sidewalks. I thought that all my life, because I was told that all my life. So I believed it. 

But I got to thinking, it just doesn't seem, well, safe. And it doesn't same sane. It didn't make sense. So I looked it up. 

In least in my state:

It was a law at one time, back in the days before cars were a big thing and things that moved fast. Cars were few and far between, so to leave sidewalks safe for the many more pedestrians there were, before cars were a big thing, cyclists had to stay on the road, for the safety of all the people walking.

But that law in (in my state) was taken out the law books a long time ago. And cyclists can now ride safely and legally on the sidewalks, where it much more safe for them to be."

I'm so sorry you lost your little love <3

Edit: But now I have a fur baby again, and I am very happy I have her in my life. I remember my other cats for the special traits and own little personalities, and how much joy they bought me in life."

Btw, I love pointing out when they're wrong and give me attitude for it."

What is a problem for us (and you to, I'm sure) is people sliding/inserting their card before the reader is ready. 

So.Many.People. Then they get all mad at you because they didn't read what the reader was saying, and they think they paid.  And they get all suspicious and sometimes yell that they ""paid already"". I am so very, very sick of this."

I'd rather talk to people face to face, in about 3 months of knowing a person and observing them I can do it.

Should get help? :<"

Weekends are usually always busy. As are holidays - holidays are probably the busiest. And summers are busier than winters, because kids are of school and stuff. And look out for new releases. Especially Disney and Marvel can get quite busy."
