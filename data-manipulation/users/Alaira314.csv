CitiesSkylines,fg0qlh6,t1_ffy8dqi,1580413092.0,"It's been a problem ever since I've been alive. Where I live, our main north/south highway is beyond capacity and backs up at rush hour. This pushes traffic to the other north/south option - a residential street that runs parallel to this highway for about 10 miles. It became a major artery for travel, despite having houses directly on it, because the infrastructure is so far above capacity. This has been true since at least the 90s, well before google maps was a thing."
gaming,fg09y1n,t1_ffzfr0a,1580403368.0,"I don't believe it's included in any of those types of mods, because I recently had to switch hard drives and reinstalled a bunch of my old favorites(along with the bugfix patch, of course). Skyrim, New Vegas and Fallout 3(which sadly I never got working properly on windows 10, crashes every 5 minutes :( ) all set me to ""very low"" settings. I believe it's an issue with windows 10 hardware detection, as I don't remember having the problem on 7 with the same GPU and CPU. I'd be interested to hear if anyone else is on 10 playing those same games(especially the later two, New Vegas and Skyrim, which don't predate my hardware by much) and not experiencing the problem."

* [""The results showed that although smokers had generally higher annual medical expenditures than nonsmokers, the former's lifetime medical expenditure was slightly lower than the latter's because of a shorter life expectancy that resulted from a higher mortality rate.""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22449823)

* [""Smoking was associated with a greater mean annual healthcare cost of €1600 per living individual during follow-up. However, due to a shorter lifespan of 8.6 years, smokers’ mean total healthcare costs during the entire study period were actually €4700 lower than for non-smokers.""](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/6/e001678)

* [""Health care costs for smokers at a given age are as much as 40 percent higher than those for nonsmokers, but in a population in which no one smoked the costs would be 7 percent higher among men and 4 percent higher among women than the costs in the current mixed population of smokers and nonsmokers.""](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199710093371506)

I ran my initial search as ""smokers cost more than nonsmokers myth"" and got a *lot* of results saying what you're saying, but absolutely no numbers to support the claim. The numbers I found are in support of the opposite, despite what I feel is a neutral search string. Not to say people shouldn't be quitting, so don't argue with me like I'm saying we should all go smoke to save healthcare money(especially since it's a relatively small amount per person), but all actual evidence I can find makes it looks like this is an awkward truth, rather than a myth."
bestof,ffyqfoo,t1_ffypc23,1580352626.0,"My objection to the zipper was more that I would like to know if the package of underwear I was buying had been previously opened. A regular plastic bag would tell me this on sight, as well as preventing the resale-as-new of opened(potentially worn) underwear that had been returned. I know you wash them before you wear them, but it's still squick. Everything else that can be stealth-worn(no tags, etc) and returned comes in a bag that's obvious if it's been opened."
todayilearned,ffyq3fp,t1_ffyd68r,1580352391.0,He writes plenty of books. Some of them are even set in the universe of ASOIAF. He just doesn't want to write Winds of Winter.
todayilearned,ffypy9o,t1_ffymmia,1580352292.0,"It seems to be a common fantasy trope. I remember reading the Imager series by Modesitt and reading paragraphs upon paragraphs of whatever fancy meal they were eating that day. I'm not sure why fantasy authors emphasize their food descriptions so much, but it's something that I've come to expect(and tolerate) from the genre, right along with names that I have no idea how to pronounce."
bestof,ffyp1wn,t1_ffy6449,1580351681.0,"I'm female, our underwear doesn't come in 15 packs. I wish it did, because then it would be like economy socks instead of a lot of extra packaging(plastic zipper(???) bag and a cardboard core) that just gets thrown away."
bestof,ffxv4df,t1_ffxtbcs,1580333021.0,"That seems excessive. I just buy a 5-pack of normal fruit of the loom for $7.99 at wal-mart every year or two, so I can toss any old ones that've found religion. The expensive underwear they sell on single hangers always looks so uncomfortable, like lingerie but not sexy enough."
bestof,ffxrwps,t1_ffxl8h1,1580331215.0,"People buy and wear used shoes all the time. Generally not well-off people, mind you, but that's one of the squick lines that's the first to go because shoes are expensive. It's especially common for kids, who tend to grow out of shoes before they wear out. I didn't usually get the hand-me-down shoes because they tended to wear out before they got to me(I was the 4th girl in line, and #3 was very sporty and hard on all her clothes), but I know people further up the line got them in the bags and there's also a trade through thrift stores.

Now, if you want to talk secondhand squick, let's have a conversation about underwear. I'm aware that some people do buy it, but I've never been that desperate."
bestof,ffxigf1,t1_ffxgpao,1580325796.0,"The people in question are middle school students(age 11-13, for those outside the US). As the teacher addressed in one of their comments, people at that level of brain development are prone to some very shitty impulsive behaviors because their empathy centers aren't fully developed yet. For example, they might be incapable of understanding why an adult authority figure couldn't just go replace the shoes, because adults have bank accounts and paychecks right? Adults drop hundreds of dollars a month on stuff, $150 isn't a big deal to them like it is to a kid! That doesn't excuse the behavior, but it explains it pretty damn well."

AskReddit,ffxej82,t1_ffxbx6w,1580323532.0,"It's true, but I'd still take a \*-phobic person who identified the shift in culture and changed their (public, at least) behavior appropriately over someone who gave the shift in culture the middle finger and keep on going with whatever they were doing before. I encounter people regularly who praise the latter for their integrity, and say they're better than the former because ""at least they're honest."" Yeah, but they're an asshole. But they're *honest*!

There's a lot to be said for the realization that you live in a society where something is unacceptable, and that you must alter your behavior in order to exist positively in that society. This is something all of us do all the time. Did you really mean ""sorry to interrupt"" when you asked that retail employee a question the other day? No, but you said it anyway, because we live in a society and that's how we're expected to behave. People who fail to realize that, or actively reject the realization, aren't better just because they're ""honest""! They're jerks."
