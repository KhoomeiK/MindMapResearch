My mom told me when I was a kid that ""I would rather work 70 hour weeks than spend a moment home with you kids"". I was hurt but later on I understood that she hadn't meant to be rude or a terrible person, she was just being honest.

There is value in paying for good quality products but just because it's a popular brand or expensive doesn't mean it's good. 

For sure sample, Levi's jeans are good quality but they're seen a ""cheap brand"" and O personally don't like them for the fit, feel or design. Nikes are expensive but many of them are not good quality.

AskReddit,fget39e,t3_ey28o4,1580709017.0,"The unsexy stuff: Make sure both people are clean (get tested regularly). Use condoms and using a secondary form of birth control is also advisable. Be prepared that pregnancy is always a possible consequence of heterosexual sex. Talk about your expectations (is it a ONS, casual, or something more serious) Also, having a good silicone based lubricant and a towel in hand is helpful. Talk about what each of you wants, needs, likes and dislikes. Good sex doesn't just happen, you have to work together to make it good. And think about consent, if one of you says stop or feels/seems uncomfortable then you need to stop immediately. Go pee immediately before and immediately after, don't wait five minutes, get up and go pee. UTIs are painful and happen easily when you don't pee after sex.

When you finally get down to it, take your time, lots of foreplay to make sure both people are ready and fully aroused. Then even during sex, take your time, make sure you both out effort into making sure the other person and yourself are enjoying yourself. Be gentle with the other person's parts, genitals and breasts are very sensitive things and squeezing, biting, pinching, pressing too hard can be painful."

I'm glad you seem to have access to decent vets and I do agree that saying ""don't feed grain-free"" is probably not the best advice. Just pay attention to what you are feeding them. Any cat food that has a high concentration of vegetables is probably not the best choice since they're carnivores by nature.

Depending on the size and kind of the dog, you can pay anywhere from $50-$150 a month for pet insurance and $20-$200 on food (big dogs need more food). Cost of routine vet care and dental care (not typically covered by insurance) can range from $200-$500 a year. Plus the cost of things like training, leashes, collars/harnesses, toys, poop bags, treats etc.

Just take your time and really think about the financial and time costs before you do it. You'll have to arrange for care if you ever want to go away and can't take it with you, you have to walk it and clean up after it and spend time on training."

Maybe it has something to do with the fillers, the type and amount, in many grain-free foods, not the lack of grain itself. I know a lot use things like corn, peas and potatoes as fillers in place of the traditional grains rather than just lowering the carb content and removing grains. 

Or maybe these foods are typically lower in taurine or not in a form they can utilize or don't have something else that's necessary to process the taurine?

At my Walmart the cheapest that I could use (per tampon) is a 12 pack for $6.99 plus tax. I would need at minimum three boxes per period, plus a pack of pads roughly once every other period ($5.99), and a pack of liners twice a year or so ($7.99).

That's roughly $30 a month on supplies that are a necessity. In my teens and early 20s, $30 was a lot of money, when I was constantly already making the choice between paying my rent or buying groceries. 

Sure for some people it's not that big of a deal to pay $30 for but for some it can literally be the difference between paying rent and being homeless.
