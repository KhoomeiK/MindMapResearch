Cure is to stop comparing yourself to anyone. This is you journey and it anyone has learnt something before you, that doesn't make your achievement less meaningful and less worthy of celebration. It might mean you had to put even more effort into learning it. You should honour every goal you achieved and be proud of yourself for it, cuz you freaking deserve it."

It also happens every now and then that I dream of me being unable to open my eyes, scratching eyelids in order to see. Unbearable experience, makes me uncomfortable just as I think about it. 

It's like this primary, intense urge that can't be expressed and it makes you so damn frustrated, I know."

infp,fdgca19,t3_el4pn5,1578389763.0,"True so much it hurts... 

It also sounds lotta like a BPD feature. I wonder how the features of INFPs and those of BPD and social anxiety overlap, and how to be a healthy INFP. I mean... if I overcome those issues, will I still be INFP?"

Also they're not very intense, as I've heard. This was a purely magical orgasm that took over the whole body. It made me wake up of intensity. Then I wondered, doubting if it really happened or was I just imagining, exactly for the reason you mentioned, no evidence except for the weirdly aware arousal."

FriendshipAdvice,fcx61li,t3_eje7v3,1578052715.0,"I think you are too dependant on that person, hence you expect a bit too much. It seems you have based your value on her perception of you. Try hard not to do build your worth on others in the future. You should be your own favourite person, number one, best friend or however you want to call it. I suggest you take some time for yourself and connect with yourself. Dependency, jealousy and such things stem from insecurities. Talk to your friend about it as well, tell her how you feel, and that you're afraid of losing this friendship."

Codependency,fca1wd6,t1_fc9smrm,1577561779.0,"So true, we tend to subconsciously create the environment where our unhealthy disorder would flourish. Hence it's crucial to acknowledge it, make it conscious and communicate about it. Even if you fall in love with a narcissist, which is very likely, you two can grow out of bad behaviour together. Think that's actually the way to do it, to heal through it together, question our defence mechanism and boundaries. 

I'm in the similar defensively single stage now and 
it seems to me that you're on a good path, keep up the good work.

I also really like the part where you said to respond only when feeling safe. That's an excellent reminder, thank you."
Codependency,fca0tg9,t1_fc9jbpq,1577561152.0,This is really well told.
Codependency,fc9z9gb,t3_egszhn,1577560431.0,"Yes, very likely indeed. It's about energies we emit and compensations we have to make because of traumas we survived.

 I've read an interesting article some time ago that explained why people with these disorders attract each other and choose each other as partners. Although this article is talking about borderlines and narcissists, it still answers why we fall for those who are fucked up in the reverse way than we are.

To generalize and shorten it; borderlines, narcissists and most people with personality disorders all lack intimacy skill because of their inability to see things as both bad and good at the same time.
