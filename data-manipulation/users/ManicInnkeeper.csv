bipolar,ffdh2vi,t3_et0m60,1579820718.0,"I lost my mom about a year and a half ago(actually, Saturday would've been her 60th). It's one of the worst things we have to go through in life, and I'm sorry you're having to go through it now.

The first year is the worst. Hitting the holidays and milestones usually. Brace yourself. But, over time, it does get better. You aren't a burden by talking to your family about this. Some of my best healing came from sharing the grief with someone else that had cared about her. If your offline friends don't have the mental headspace to listen, you matter to everyone here and my inbox is always open. 

Ultimately, give yourself as much space as you need to properly grieve and heal. I... did not do that, and it sent my mental health into a tailspin(which I believe is not uncommon in bipolar).

Wishing the best, friend."
AmItheAsshole,ffd9lbo,t3_eszrlr,1579816116.0,"NTA. You had been communicating with these people all this time, it's only appropriate that you continued in the same vein. It's not your fault if they started asking questions."
bipolar,ffcxql4,t3_esy60b,1579809458.0,None. That's one of the reasons I like it here so much.
AmItheAsshole,ffcu2nk,t3_esuu90,1579807271.0,"NTA, because you have the right to remove yourself from what makes you uncomfortable. But, as many are saying, that sudden shift is *not* typical and she might need the help of a counselor."
bipolar,ffcpa09,t3_eswrlf,1579804307.0,Really enjoy your style
bipolar,ffcp654,t3_eswpbc,1579804239.0,"Awesome! Knowing you're doing better is one thing, but hearing it from others is so darn nice."
bipolar,ffcnf8a,t3_esvy70,1579803167.0,"Favorite: How intensely I can feel connections to things like music and nature.

Least Favorite: Not being able to shut the fuck up!"
AmItheAsshole,ffcn2xi,t3_esw6ub,1579802954.0,"NAH. It was an honest mistake. But speaking as a woman, being groped when you aren't expecting it can make you feel pretty icky to begin with. The dad part is an extra layer of icky. Just give them time to process."
projectcar,ffcm0rm,t3_eswcbj,1579802308.0,"You sure? Looks like an '09 Beagle to me.

Jokes aside, love a Galaxie!"
AmItheAsshole,ffcb81s,t3_esjhx2,1579795685.0,"YTA, and shame on you to boot. Let that kid be a part of a family tradition! Who cares if she's not around next year? She needs love and acceptance *now*."
AmItheAsshole,ffcasxz,t3_esp9yw,1579795418.0,YTA. There's no need to bring up a non-issue like that out of the blue.
AmItheAsshole,ffc9xsp,t3_espv3c,1579794879.0,NAH. Sounds like you missed out on a nice surprise.
AmItheAsshole,ffc5hz9,t3_esrtrc,1579791997.0,NTA. He screwed himself out of that one(and out of what could've been a great recommendation for his next job).
AmItheAsshole,ffbzmud,t3_essrci,1579787710.0,"YTA. I thought you meant it was some crazy, unnatural red, but covering up her natural hair? Way too much. What's next, no blondes at the reception?"
bipolar,ffawlxz,t3_esm6iu,1579746184.0,"Yep! Weed to keep me from being too hyper and getting to sleep, alcohol to suppress the brain. Not the best ideas, but I'm managing well enough."
AmItheAsshole,ffafb5t,t3_es6cjd,1579734391.0,NAH. My parents did this all the time(except with green eggs and ham). Its a nice memory as a grown up!
AmItheAsshole,ffa8ma3,t3_eshydh,1579730010.0,"NTA. I don't understand this ""don't talk about blank that happened at blank"" thing. Mass shootings happen often, and that means whether we like it or not it will come up in other people's conversations. I would say no assholes, but she went beyond ""I'm uncomfortable, please don't"" and straight to ""You, a stranger, are going to stop speaking about this because I said so."""
AmItheAsshole,ff9wyk4,t3_esh2ud,1579723312.0,"NTA. There's a difference between being ashamed of what she's saying, and how she's saying it. Ollie had every right to stand up for herself(especially as hurt as I imagine she was by what your mother was saying), but it sounds like she really crossed a line with the ""how"" and you apologized for that."
AmItheAsshole,ff9i9hz,t3_esezac,1579713593.0,"NAH. Be honest with your mom. There are some things you can share on a wedding day, but this would be too much.

Sorry for the loss, OP. Hope the healing starts sooner rather than later."
AmItheAsshole,ff9fte5,t3_esd7pl,1579712096.0,"NTA. People are right, you don't know the ""whole story"". But the way he looked at his mom before accepting the blanket? That tells enough."
