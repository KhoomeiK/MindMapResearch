Yes, that investigation after public outcry. But you knew that. 

When you say stuff like “why is it so wrong if some one says ‘I won’t use this because racists do.’” And “what’s so wrong with education.” You’re implying that using the ok symbol is only used by uneducated racists. 

No one is being a bad faith actor here, it’s just annoying when people go out of their way to be offended.
