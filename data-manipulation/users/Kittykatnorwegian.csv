secretsanta,few6hg8,t3_ei99c9,1579405977.0,"I have done 3 rematches this year( I only joined December 31, so no gifts for me yet;)). It’s been fun, but expensive. I don’t mind the cost of the gifts, it’s the postage that makes me go pale..but then I have sent to India, Belarus and Russia. Not the most accessible of places! I look forward to the next Secret Santa, for then I can plan a little better. I have had to use Amazon, so the poor people don’t have to wait so long! But it feels so impersonal.."

CatsMovie,fdxqggq,t3_ekvg3y,1578771815.0,"I thought it was a wonderful movie. Maybe it wasn’t perfect, but there was still some gems there. Francesca Heyward was a revelation! Sir Ian and Dame Judi was amazing."
CatsMovie,fdxpsvz,t3_el97fc,1578771639.0,"I loved This movie, but I don’t think it was all good. Idris Elba was woefully underused, and Rebel Wilson was not all that good..but Sir Ian and Dame Judi was amazing.  Francesca Heyward was a revelation! I actually cried when I heard Memory, even though I have heard it lots of times before .  Jennifer Hudson made it very moving."
aww,fdxkbfr,t3_en8enw,1578769624.0,Pure genius!
