FRC,fdjw4bo,t3_elnfe6,1578489423.0,"Recycle Rush was a solid game from the standpoint of the strategy and engineering problems presented. As a spectator sport it failed, mostly due to no interaction and a confusing scoring system for people who hadn’t read the manual."
Browns,fdh50n2,t1_fdgk7e8,1578415517.0,"I think the worry is translating success from OC to HC. We just had a bad experience with someone who might be a quality OC but was a terrible HC. Not saying Josh is Freddie, just explaining why many are reluctant."

starterpacks,fdgpvar,t1_fdgl7vy,1578405166.0,"Most parts of the US don’t even have a train system. Cities might have a subway system or a partial train system, but most just have buses. There are also some limited inter-city trains, but they don’t connect to everything. I do wish the system was better, especially in the metro areas, but when the country is almost as big as Europe but with more space between things it gets difficult."

TellMeAFact,fd24c2e,t3_ejueey,1578141473.0,"ASL is distinct from BSL (British Sign Language), but is pretty similar to LSF (French Sign Language). Similar enough that a lot of vocabulary and basic structure are the same. The reason is that ASL was started when Thomas Gallaudet went to Europe to learn about methods for teaching deaf children. The people in Britain where he went first treated their methods as a secret so he went to France as a second choice. He met Laurent Clerc there and convinced him to come back to America with him. They founded a school for the deaf and ASL was formed as a combination of Clerc’s LSF, existing home signs from the first students, and inventing new signs and concepts as needed."

Browns,fcu6wvg,t1_fcu60oy,1577974007.0,I think the key thing we need which McCarthy has is experience and stability. We can’t have someone basically learning how to be a head coach and manage a new city and a new team and our media and the expectations all at once.
Browns,fco5z1l,t3_ei7ra3,1577824716.0,"I don’t know that I’d want McCarthy directly running the offense, but as a head coach I’d be pretty happy."
Browns,fco5huo,t3_ei7hza,1577824461.0,I’m not happy about this. Is it possible that he was limiting the coaching search?

starwarsminiatures,fckafnt,t3_ehho3l,1577720842.0,"For bulk commons, I just put them in boxes sorted by faction. For more fragile figures (battle droids or customs) or for figures I use a lot, I sort them out in hardware or fishing tackle boxes, since they have a bunch of little compartments."
starwarsminiatures,fciztv4,t3_ehfq5e,1577673775.0,"People do still play the game (there’s a pretty active, if small, community over at bloomilk.com) but the minis have been out of production for a while. Most of them are still relatively cheap and easy to find though."
todayilearned,fciv7hy,t1_fcitopg,1577670606.0,"Okay, I see what you’re saying. So the straw man is assuming that Jesus being a lunatic would fundamentally change the view that Jesus’ moral teachings are applicable without accepting his other claims."
nfl,fcity8l,t1_fciq9fg,1577669742.0,Imagine firing a coach who was leading a tank. He only got fired after the tank ended and then he only got half a season. Freddie was not leading a tank.

todayilearned,fciq9qg,t1_fcidsk6,1577667253.0,"Maybe I’m confused about what you’re saying, but how is it a straw man? The lunatic doesn’t refer to someone who holds that view about Jesus but about Jesus if he’s not God. The way I understand it, Jesus claimed to be God, so he’s either right, wrong and knows he’s not, or wrong and doesn’t know he’s not (the lunatic)."
