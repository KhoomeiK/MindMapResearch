Unexpected,ffp07zy,t1_ffnzlcp,1580083914.0,"I really enjoy talking to people about this misunderstanding, since I’ve grown up hearing or using that word for things that aren’t martial arts related. I usually add that in most English sentences, someone usually isn’t trying to say they *know* skill, but are trying to say they *have* or *obtained* skill. So, in the Matrix, when Neo says “I know kung fu,” I find it funny. It sounds in context like Neo is saying “I, all of a sudden, understand what skill is when I see it” to Morpheus, instead of “now I, Neo, have that skill”"

For example, black people have to try harder to look more professional whereas white people don’t. It’s like a double standard? Or maybe white people will keep taking Asian things and not really learn anything about the culture other than superficial things, maybe even casually mocking Asians in general."

trashy,feyly2c,t1_fey0hj5,1579447378.0,"I was like this when I was younger. It’s funny in the moment to you and your friends because being an asshole gets responses like “omg you’re crazy, I can’t believe he did that, this guy doesn’t care about rules at all” and it’s just an increasing level of assholery. Then you grow up and realize you have to be a functioning member of society, it’s not very nice to do the pranks you used to do, and no one’s laughing anymore. And also you watch a new batch of assholes grow up and think to yourself “wow I was that guy”"

There is also this attraction to blood. When you’re on top of a body it tends to purge blood out of its mouth, while you’re making passionate love… You’d have to be there, I guess.”"
