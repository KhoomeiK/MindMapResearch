selfimprovement,fgj7pb7,t3_eysj2v,1580838589.0,"Lear to STFU, in most of cases, its better to remain silent. If you really want to something, try to think about the outcome before talking. Think about winning a argument vs someone. Yes, after an hard dispute, you won, and then, so what? It may destroy the relation between you. 
Listen twice as much as you talk.
Well, thats my advices, hope it helps you."
