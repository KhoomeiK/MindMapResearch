Do NOT have a child you do not absolutely 110% want to have. Do not let your bf talk you into a permanent life changing scenario if it is not completely, wholly and truly what you want. 

I've personally been childfree since I was a teen, and no magic penis will ever change my mind on that."

childfree,ffhr1jg,t3_ethqn6,1579949368.0,"Did you have yours done laparoscopically? Give it a year or 2 and they'll be so faint and tiny you'll barely know they're there. There's not much to 'cover up' as such in terms of scarring. But if having some cute tattoos over them floats your boat then go ahead, it's your body! 

I would recommend leaving it at least a couple of years though to let your scars heal as much as possible. I took the stitches out of one of mine a little too early and it was quite dark and raised for a while, but it's only a faint, smooth line now :)"

EatCheapAndHealthy,ffc5358,t3_esgqv6,1579791721.0,"Meal prepping.

It's a lot easier to eat healthier if you have pre-made meals waiting for you. Ok so work won't let you store food in the fridge?Maybe try a lunch box which you can put ice packs in to keep your food fresh. No one needs to know that's in your bag. 

Look specifically for receipes that either dont need refrigerating or can be eaten cold, this might be tricky but google is your friend. Good luck!"

SkincareAddictionUK,ff8rmz6,t3_es1jux,1579693342.0,"You can get acnecide OTC from any pharmacy. It's pretty strong stuff, so use it sparingly - I spot treat chest acne to good success with it. 

If your acne has persisted since your teens it might be worth a visit to your GP - if you're female and it's hormonal based then the pill or a retinol can help manage it. Your GP can also refer you to a dermatologist if they feel you might need to look at accutane or other stronger options."
SkincareAddictionUK,ff5mrn4,t1_ff5mmre,1579600676.0,"Yup, it's why I eventually went back to my pre-Epiduo moisturiser, TO NMF after trying the Cetaphil and then Cerave (which def broke me out) - if it ain't broken, don't fix it!"
SkincareAddictionUK,ff5mfpz,t1_ff5m1m6,1579600163.0,"I feel you, I've been on Epiduo for 3+ months and it really is difficult to tell if its the active or if it's another product you're using! 

It may be better to stick with what you know tbh, especially if you've used it successfully in the past when your skin was clear. What breaks out one person doesn't for another!"
SkincareAddictionUK,ff5jf8o,t3_ernqix,1579595691.0,"I was recommended it by my GP, but like you I also hated that it didnt seem to sink into my skin and left an oily finish. I didn't use it long enough to find out if it aggrevated my acne or not.

It makes an ok hand lotion though (it's now sat on my desk at work).

My HG is TO natural moisturising factors, lovely matte finish!"
SkincareAddiction,ff36c27,t3_erd2yo,1579534737.0,"Yup!

My understanding is that it's an occulsive - it sits as a protective layer over the skin helps prevent the moisture in your skin from evaporating. 

I use it as a final layer at night to seal in all the moisture when my skin is especially dry/irritated/unhappy. If I use it too much it can make me break out on my jawline, but around my sensitive cheeks and eye area it's a godsend. 

Also - got a cold? Layer vaseline over moisturiser on your red, sore nose, it will help stop it getting so sore and flaky."

Interstitialcystitis,fel1v4g,t1_fel15zp,1579212247.0,"I can understand why you're apprehensive, especially if you do find it beneficial with minimal side effects  and then have to consider if you're prepared to take it long term and aforementioned withdrawals. 

Many people do take anti-depressants and other meds like that though if they believe the benefits and improvement to quality of life outweigh the risks of potential addiction/withdrawal, and you will only know the answer to that by trying it."
Interstitialcystitis,fekz878,t3_epnip0,1579210675.0,"Well, it won't hurt to trial it for a few weeks amd see if it helps your symptoms. You won't know until you try it.

Personally, it turned me into a suicidal mess after a week, and I had also had heart flutters, a dry mouth, dizziness and severe drowsiness (these side effects may have settled had I continued). BUT - it did help with my IC pain and urgency, and I can say I certaintly slept well! I preferred not being suicidal though.

I also personally refuse to take anti-depressants as I'm highly concerned about the potential risks of long term use and being unable to come off them - there are some nasty withdrawal horror stories out there. You will be fine if you only take it for a few weeks, but it's something to bear in mind long term."

Interstitialcystitis,fejtlbd,t3_epjrs3,1579185535.0,"I would recommend applying an emollient cream - like a nappy rash cream, Conotrane/etc to the area as this will soothe it, and make it easier to pass hard stools. Also, take some laxatives.

edit: also check with a doc that you dont have hemmeroids - that'll require more specialist treatment."
