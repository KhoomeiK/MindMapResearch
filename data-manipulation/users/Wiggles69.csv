Well it sounds like spark is fine and spark timing is sweet. If the afm to throttle tube isn't cracked then The 2 things left are fuel or compression. If you have a compression tester then give it a check just for piece of mind, it's probably fine but is pretty easy to check.

You said you could feather the throttle and get the revs up, but big throttle openings made it stall yeah? That makes me think its more a fuel issue.

Is it still showing smoke when it runs? or was that just on initial start up? If it was just on the first start i wouldn't worry.

The general process of trouble shooting these things is to determine if it's a spark, fuel or compression issue

If you can get it to idle, connect the diag port and check the ignition timing with a timing light. It's super easy to get it a tooth out, or to just have the timing off. Should be 10 degrees BTDC with the diag port shorted out.

> outside of that I haven't touched anything on the fuel lines, so there shouldn't be any way they'd have gotten reversed.

Did you remove the fuel lines off the hard lines on the firewall? it's easy to reverse the feed and returns since it isn't obvious which is which - especially on a conversion. You could remove the feed line from the filter and run it to a container and run the pump to confirm.

What fittings did you use to relocate the pulsation damper? If they're too small or you used thread tape and some overhung the orifice they could restrict fuel flow and could cause the issue you describe. If you have or can borrow a fuel pressure guage, check that you're getting good fuel pressure into the rail and the pressure stays high when running (indicates good flow). 

If that's all fine, double check the timing marks on the cams and crank, make sure you aren't a tooth out on one or the other (very easy to do) that'll cause all sorts of headaches."
AE86,fduitxe,t1_fduigra,1578733712.0,"Oh, and stick a timing light on it with the diag pins shorted. If you're out a tooth or the timing is really far out,  it'll run like a dog (or not at all) and it's super easy to mess it up upon reassembly."

It sounds like you've either got too much air or not enough fuel. Check your TVIS vsv is plugged in ( vacuums lines and electrical plug) so its not stuck open at idle. Also reseat the injector connectors in case one or more aren't plugged in properly. That will starve fuel but it might still idle on 3 cylinders.

Since you had the thing apart, triple check that the fuel lines are connected  the right way around - the fuel should come out of the pump, into the filter then into the front of the fuel rail, and the fuel pressure regulator at the back of the rail should feed into the return line. Get it backwards and it'll **almost** run at idle but die when you open the throttle."

Double check all the vacuum hoses including all the vacuum switches and capped ports.

Check the intake manifold bolts are snug too while you're there.

If you have a smoke machine, plumb it into the manifold, seal the throttle and see if any smoke makes it out.
