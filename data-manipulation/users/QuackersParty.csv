PublicFreakout,ffqp2ys,t3_eukaax,1580140322.0,"A lot of the videos on this sub make me very frustrated, but *this*

This is a very good reason for a public freak out"

careerguidance,ffqm9um,t1_ffq3kk3,1580138372.0,Neat! I guess it depends on how your uni structures the degree or something.

careerguidance,ffoyh4k,t1_ffowzgl,1580083293.0,No worries! Honestly the best skill for my job is being able to deal compassionately with distressed people. If you can make a something you currently do sound like it fits that skill i think you’re good. (Also if you don’t mind really gross things sometimes)
careerguidance,ffovovu,t1_ffouz3h,1580082405.0,"Yeah, when I was in college I did an internship at the county coroner’s office. Most sheriff’s offices have some kind of intershiping situation available, so that’s the networking I did I guess. Where I work now is in a different county in the same state, but having performance evaluations and stuff from another LEA is really helpful.

The downside of course is there’s a bit of extensive background checking, and you’re not supposed to break the law."

dogswithjobs,ffoq2w5,t1_ffooa5k,1580080402.0,That’s one of those things that makes a ton of sense but I would never have thought of! How interesting!
