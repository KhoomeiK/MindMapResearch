postmates,fect944,t3_eogjwb,1578983725.0,"I've only gotten one customer twice. The first time, she didn't specify which building she was in at her work complex, so when I called her asking which one, I guess she took that as me asking her to meet me downstairs outside. She didn't tip me that time, probably because she (thought she) had to leave her office. The second time, she had in all caps which building she was in, the floor, and the person who I could leave the food with. She tipped that time but not much"
sanantonio,fecswto,t3_eoh8hl,1578983355.0,"There was a derailment I think sometime in the mid to late 2000s decade on tracks that cross Fredericksburg Rd between the Blanco and Culebra intersections, just north of downtown. The train took out at least one house, but the tracks are still in use today."
sanantonio,fdjcps8,t3_elnznj,1578465488.0,"There are a few on Blanco and Fulton. In particular, I've had good luck finding things at The Junction, but there's a new smaller place a couple of doors down, and Karolina's across the street is good too"

wikipedia,fcza4fy,t1_fcz6aru,1578096758.0,"Under Roman Empire/Byzantine law? Maybe. But not under any legal entity today. And all of that is just political. Rome has enough ecclesiastical significance for even the Orthodox today to place the See of Rome the first among equals if there wasn't a schism (or at the very least, if they installed their own patriarch)."
wikipedia,fcyxzth,t1_fcypdam,1578089564.0,"Nope. Even now, the Orthodox believe the See of Rome to be the first *among equals.* They leave the see of Rome vacant (like the Catholics leave the see of Constantinople vacant), so the next highest see, Constantinople, gets to be their head - again, among equals.

Ecclesiastically, Rome was always pretty important; politically it was a different story. And it was always about the power of the head: absolute like the Catholic model or among equals like the Orthodox model"

saltierthancrait,fcvdqvq,t1_fcv7ujk,1577999968.0,"The main three not reuniting was very unsettling for me. I also thought that particular way was a weak way for Han to die. After seeing him in the OT go from a selfish smuggler to someone who cares, it would've made more sense for him to die in a heroic/sacrifice/putting it all on the line kinda way. That was the hill I would've rather seen him die on instead of dying in a vulnerable moment. It also made what Leia did in ROS parental intervention take two and by then it was kinda old."
saltierthancrait,fcvcc86,t1_fcv8ci1,1577999123.0,"It's a combination of the two. The line itself is extra cheesy and is far from the ""would it help if I got out and pushed"" by Leia level of humor. It felt like they were trying too hard to be funny. At the same time, Kylo Ren and the First Order were flexing their evil muscles in that scene and the line just killed the mood."
