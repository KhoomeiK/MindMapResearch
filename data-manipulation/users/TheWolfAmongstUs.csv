AskReddit,fei0xaj,t1_fei0fta,1579127883.0,"Where I live, the rules for euthanasia are  amongst others: the patient has to ask it multiple times over an extended period of time. The initial question should be in writing. Doctors can always refuse when they are against it and when they want to agree they have to consult 2 other doctors who are expert in the disease first. Euthanasia cannot be forced upon someone, it is the consent that has been repeatedly formed between the doctors and the patient."
dogs,fehz0u1,t3_ep5jpm,1579126738.0,"It's time. We did the same with our 16 year old boy when he couldn't walk anymore and we had to carry him outside and support him to pee or poop. He had become blind already and in his final days also deaf. His heart was super strong and healthy so it sucked but his life quality was, despite all the attention and the hugs, really just zero. We can't let them suffer in silence. It's a good decision to have them sleep in before it gets to an awful point. Just realize they had a great life and that it's really just their time to go. If you'd drag this along, your dog may die because of e.g. water in their lungs due to a deteriorating heart which basically means they suffocate. Euthanasia is definitely the most dignified and gentlest way to die for them. (English is not my second language so not sure if I put it ok)."

Negative things: a bit dirtier than the Netherlands; awful traffic, bad roads, seemingly worse attitude in traffic; Flemish people can be very negative and frustrated cause they fail to be open bout their initial feelings; hierarchy is more common at the workfloor and this leads to retarded situations.
