I do like the carry gameplay a lot, even if some people might think it's boring. In turn, I don't really dig the support play style, partly due to not knowing what I'm doing, partly due to not being able to do things I do best (farm, move efficiently, feel like I'm bringing a lot of impact on my own). I like to have control over the situation, rather than rely on a carry player which might be 50/50 either great or awful.

This situation, in analogy to a restaurant, would be if the owner of the place told you ""Either you go to the kitchen and cook now, or you don't get any meals at all"". It's also what the OP says and thinks is reasonable.

I ""Pay"" to my supports by being extremely nice to them, as well as playing well. They assist me at the beginning, I assist them at the end. That's the analog of ""Being nice, following rules and paying"", as you said.

When you see a downvoted comment, your brain start to automatically search for reasons why the person being downvoted is wrong. How come, a dude got 2k upvotes, he's certainly correct! I do that too, guilty.

But my argument is very reasonable here. He's calling me a prick because I let people who know how to play support do their job, while I do my part of it. It's not like supports are selfless people who sacrifice themselves for the sake of the community, if you might've thought that from the description. Some people enjoy playing support a lot, and thus they try their best as that role.

Also, you have to know what this is all for - and the answer is, so that people have to wait a few minutes less to find a match. That's all this patch does. In turn, the last 10 games I played were miserable, where all the supports (me included when I have to play it) are awful, or even harmful, and the carries get frustrated and start raging, too. Which hasn't happened to me in months at this point.

Me playing support reduces the quality of the game for everybody else enormously. I'm now forced to play support, so I do, but I'm not enjoying it nor I ever will, thus I'm not ever going to be a good support. Valve invented a ~~idiotic~~ brilliant way of adding more supports - forcing people who hate it and don't know how to do it to.. do it. Just like people in an oppressive regime are forced to do something they don't want to do ""for the greater good"". How does that end up usually?

The way fast queue work is they give a higher priority to people who agreed to play that scarce role (support).

And I'm a position 1, so I had to wait for 10+ minutes to find a match. And you know what? It was totally fine. I better wait 10 minutes and then enjoy the match, then spend 2 and hate it.

It was already enough of a problem with people ~~griefing~~ playing support without giving a single fuck about how the role should work, because they just want fast queues. And how much bigger of a problem it will be now, when you're forced to do it?"

battlestations,felagp0,t1_fel4xaj,1579217613.0,"You're talking about TKL and 60% like they're some kind of a joke. I mean, you literally said it.

It's not. Most people don't care about the numpad."

DotA2,fel4njv,t3_ephebc,1579213969.0,"I agree that they really hit way above their weight category regarding gameplay. They bring little to the game, but break certain heroes horribly.

I'm pretty sure the frog will find some balance though. Bet your soul they aren't removing the neutral items anytime soon. They've clearly spent a lot of time creating them."

battlestations,fel44o6,t1_fekslhd,1579213650.0,I think you're overstating how many people use the numpad. The only thing I ever use it for is binding some keys that don't fit on the rest of the keyboard conveniently enough. TKL is where it's at for me.
AskReddit,fel3ymf,t3_epj100,1579213548.0,"To The Moon. It's pretty popular, but I still feel like it got way less hype around it than it deserves. It's a purely story-focused game, with minimal gameplay. Walking and some minigames is usually as far as it goes. But the story is where it's at.

It made me cry like a baby. Every time I play it.

And if you'll like it, also check the other games from Freebird studios. Particularly Finding Paradise (To The Moon 2). It's just as great."
headphones,fel3fck,t1_feku0ie,1579213216.0,"It's not that hard to pick things based on reviews though. It's less about the reviews being specific and more about searching for them in the right place.

Afterall, audiophile headphones isn't such a huge market that there are hundreds of choices fine tuned for each listener individually. There are some categories where the choice is obvious (like 100 - 200$), and other where you have up to 10 options to pick from. But still, you're unlikely to go horribly wrong if you rely on the hype."
GreenAndPleasant,fel30cd,t1_fekyqgl,1579212957.0,Sounds good enough by me. And it's not like I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon. Only things I really can't get any other way.
