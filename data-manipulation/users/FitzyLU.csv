mixer,fezobyc,t1_fez6rnh,1579459629.0,"That's true, PlayStation definitely has higher numbers. I think overall, it's a Microsoft platform and not an Xbox platform per say. Microsoft has massive and everyone uses it, but I think they should hop on that and market makes her better and all honesty. Thank you for your opinion, it'll definitely help me when considering my choice"
mixer,feznohz,t1_fez5o1s,1579459405.0,"Those are actually great points, I have had issues with twitch support in the past. Whereas I literally haven't needed to contact Mixer for support yet. Thank you for your words"

mixer,fewjmun,t1_fewdaqt,1579411976.0,I had about 2000 before getting affiliate on Twitch. Mixer seems way more user friendly. It does seem a lot easier to make a career out of twitch though
mixer,fewjgtk,t1_fewd1wp,1579411859.0,Because I only ever hear not so great stuff. It's always talked down upon and everyone says it'll never be Twitch competition. I'm really starting to like it more though
