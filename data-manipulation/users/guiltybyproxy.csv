As you can imagine that didn't go over well. He was promptly fired, moved, and then somewhere along the way met Oprah. I believe he has to legally have a licensed psychologist on his show because he can't legally diagnose, unless California has a different law. I know he always has one on there, and it makes sense considering his license was revoked here in Texas."
