The Prime Minister answers China again
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen will not deal directly with the Chinese demand for an apology from the Jutland Post, but points out that in Denmark there is freedom of speech.

Mette Frederiksen emphasizes that in a country like Denmark, we have freedom of speech. 

Denmark has freedom of speech.

That was the brief message from Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen when she reacted for the first time on Tuesday to a group meeting in the Social Democracy that the Chinese Embassy in Denmark has demanded that the Jutland Post apologize for bringing a satirical drawing of the Chinese flag on Monday edition of the newspaper.

China has demanded an apology from JP, who brought a drawing of the Chinese flag with a virus. What do you think of that claim?

 
“I have nothing else to say but that we have a very, very strong tradition in Denmark not only for freedom of expression, but also for satire drawings, and we will have that in the future as well. It is a well-known Danish position, and we will not change that. ""

So you disagree with the Chinese that they can afford to demand an apology from a media?

""I just want to say that on the Danish side and on the part of the government, we can only say that we have freedom of expression in Denmark - also to draw.""

Do you intend to contact China and explain to them how freedom of expression in Denmark works?

 
""I don't think anyone is uncertain about how Denmark works in terms of freedom of expression.""

Will there be an official feedback from Denmark to China? After all, it's an official statement they made with the embassy ...

I just want to say that it is totally refreshing to have a decent conversation about this other than me being downvoted to oblivion and having ‘the projects’ cliff notes shouted at me. I will attach one of the recent replies in a minute that sums up most of the responses I have received haha. 

I accept that climate change is real but I won’t accept the severity of these fires is a result of climate change. ‘The sky is falling’ narrative polarises people and muddies the waters when trying to get people to be a part of a solution that results in looking after the planet and each other. If it were to piss down next year all we get is people saying “I told you so”. Saying climate change caused these fires is disingenuous but It certainly fits a narrative that apparently gives people the right to berate people. I’m sick to death of this with us or against us mentality and I think that’s why I have dug my heels in a bit on this because there so much more to the story people are ignoring. 

The fact remains that the trees will grow back and the animals will come back. It’s what why do. For now. 

My thoughts on this are that right now domestically and of course globally there should be a movement toward mitigating the use of fossil fuels and by extension CO2 emissions. How that happens is beyond me. Australia’s economy and many livelihoods largely depend on industries that perpetuate the use of fossil fuels. What we do next may require a solution that may not exist yet. Do we go Nuclear? But that doesn’t solve the jobs issue or the gaping hole in the economy. Even if Australia went neutral overnight it doesn’t stop China/India from what they are doing and that’s a bit scary but it won’t stop bush fires. Even if Australia was carbon neutral from the beginning of time it wouldn’t stop anything, that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t. People are using a fire to score political points and the media just keeps feeding the discourse. Everyone needs to take what they see and hear on tv with a massive grain of salt. 

Just to finish I was at the bottom of the Megalong valley (blue mountains) like 5 days ago and driving down it went from burnt black/brown to beautiful sclerophyll forest after going down 150m. Kinda crazy to see.

worldnews,fe7z38c,t1_fe7d0r8,1578920696.0,"Thankyou for the links, I honestly appreciate the effort. 

My source for the start of fires is from [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/11701132) 
I’m not bothered either way but we can both agree it isn’t arson haha 

I want to say firstly that the wetter forest burning  is uncommon but common enough not be alarming and IF climate change is to blame and we see a shrinking of the wetter biomes then it’s probably too late to stop it. These biomes do burn and are not immune to forest fire in Australia. This ‘million year old forest’ phrase thing is annoying (not the first time I have heard it) are people trying to say that none of these environments have not experienced fire in the past million years? It’s just not true. It doesn’t pop straight back up like the drier forest do but it does come back, beginning with increased fern coverage then the bigger trees and their canopies. 

I will link a journal that discusses both our arguments. It’s quite dense and as an average at best geography teacher it gave me a headache. 


The [Journal discusses ](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2211) the pre and post fire conditions of wet sclerophyll forest in Victoria.

What I take away from the study is that it has and does burn and it comes back. Being wet it resist fires at a higher rate than the drier forest so we only see fires with high severity in this area of Victoria every 70 years when it gets super dry(but it does burn in between that with less severity)

IF next year it’s dry and hot again and it burns again it will regenerate more slowly and if the pattern continues year after year, dry forest will replace the wet sclerophyll forest. However these are hypothesis not a foregone conclusion and at the moment unlikely. La Niña/el nino will change phases as will the IOD. So when I say this years fires are caused my hot and dry weather, not climate change, that’s what I mean. Nothing we are seeing is unprecedented it just sucks this year. We could go a couple decades without seeing fire conditions like these but we will see them again regardless of climate change."
worldnews,fe71xwl,t1_fe6shtl,1578908972.0,"There isn’t a comparable dollar amount in the 74/75 because they were in the middle of the country and that’s what your quote is referencing in terms of damage. Anyone who thinks arson is to blame for these fires is an idiot. The vast majority of fires are caused by human activity like discarded cigarettes, industrial activity, car exhaust, train brakes, welding etc. 
The reason these fires are bigger than usual is because of a lot of rainfall in 2011 followed by increasingly drier years, similar to what is mentioned in the quote. 
What rainforest is on fire? Can you please post the link. I am aware that we’ve lost land that usually acts as a fire break like marsh land and wetter forest which are dry due to drought. 

Does climate change increase times of drought ? possibly, are more floods possible? Will Australia be effected or largely unaffected? No one knows for sure and Id just be making assumptions like everyone else, I’d like to see our targets met and then some and fingers crossed that works. 

It’s a lack of rain not heat causing a particularly bad fire season. The main cause for the drier than average years according to the bom is a strong positive IOD in turn with El Niño. Both within their natural phases unfortunately syncing with a very hot summer preceded by drier years creating a tinderbox out in the bush. 
Record temps are a little misleading it’s more complicated than that, for example, parts of Australia now on fire had colder than usual winter with low humidity that creates drier soil and vegetation via increased evaporation. This is why you don’t hear the phrase global warming being used any more. Cold doesn’t equal wet and hot doesn’t equal dry. 
All I am saying is correlation isn’t causation you can’t point at a temp increase and say it’s why we had a fire. It doesn’t work like that."

Everyone has been taken for a massive ride on these fires as tragic as they are. If it were in Bangladesh no one would give a shit. 
Climate change is real but not responsible for these fires. It’s been very dry for years and an extremely hot and windy summer. This fire isn’t unprecedented. We won’t have another one on this scale in these areas until this one has decades of growth behind it then dries out again. Outrage culture is to blame for all the hot takes and misinformation, lack of critical thinking or understanding how the Australian government works. It would have taken you 2mins to wiki Australian bushfire history as it would have any news agency on the planet but it doesn’t sound as good when a fire that supposedly exist because of carbon emissions is smaller than one from the 1890’s.
One doesn’t prove or disprove the other but because it’s ‘current year’ and everything is bad and everyone is to blame things have to be the biggest or the worst or blame politicians or a villain. 
A bush fire is as natural as a flood or a drought in this country. 
Australia burns all the time and will continue to do so,you can’t protest it away as they need to burn or it gets to a point where under the right/wrong circumstances the fire becomes unmanageable like the one we have here. If people are under the impression that the RFS are responsible for clearing debris from an area bigger than most countries then they are very very wrong. 
This fire is large and propel have died protecting property and lives but it will not destroy the bush or cause irrevocable damage.  Hazard reduction burns mitigate loss of property and lives but would have been largely in effective for the most part this year under these conditions."

AmItheAsshole,fdmn1xj,t3_em3ata,1578556272.0,"NTA- I am a sub and I have been in this situation myself. Luckily I don’t have to be anywhere after school and can wait with the kids or do my best to find out the best option for them. 
I should add that kids are hopeless with stuff like this, they often get an idea in their heads inexplicably and just run with it. It could be one of their friends asking what they are doing after school and just getting confused. You know your kids better than anyone but just want to say I see it everyday. 
Also I used to get super nervous with parents and have brought up some weird shit their kids do as an icebreaker sometimes. 
Really hope you can resolve it, the kids always come first even if you’re going to be late or you’re hungry etc. 
Goodluck."
