thesims,ffpk7sg,t1_ffosq5q,1580097042.0,Lmao I had my alphabet Legacy starter sim marry him. Only annoying thing I've found is the jealous trait making him tense all the time.
Sims4,ffpi6ft,t3_eugm0x,1580095639.0,"Challenges are always fun to watch, or speed builds/ build with me videos."
Sims4,ffphy7q,t3_euhfzg,1580095483.0,"I find challenges to be a really good way to make a save last. Rags to riches is my favourite, but there are lots of others that you can find in this sub."
HollowKnight,ffnzgsn,t3_eucto9,1580072632.0,"I'm not really sure what you're asking... Are you getting pokemon that bear some resemblance to the characters? Dung defender has my vote, maybe a heracross? Idk if you can find that one easily in sword/shield tho"
thesims,ffitgh3,t3_etfbof,1579982294.0,Making your own cities/world's for your sims to live in would be cool. I think one of the older games had a feature like that but I don't remember using it much.
Sims4,ffiqiz7,t3_etqlxb,1579980208.0,Mine updated recently too and then reinstalled the free holiday pack. I didn't see any new items though.
Sims4,ffiq5r6,t3_etu98u,1579979950.0,"I feel like I've heard people talk about this bug before, idk if there's a fix for it though."
Sims4,ffij0cr,t3_etkmzk,1579975021.0,Shift click and reset?
