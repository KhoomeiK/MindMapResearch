Awwducational,fevzigt,t3_eqd7k1,1579403446.0,I had one of these in my house.  No idea how he got in.  Also had no idea we even HAD Flying Squirrels living in our area.  He was ADORBS!!
Awwducational,fepkfwn,t3_eqa9mx,1579322824.0,"This video is from Octolab TV.  Here is their mission statement:

Our mission is to learn more about the most magnificent creature on our planet, the octopus. Our research is strictly limited to observing their behavior. At no point do we place any of our animals in harm's way. Our priority is, always has been, and will always be the well-being and health of our octopuses.  Every octopus is different and unique. They all have their own personalities, likes, dislikes, and moods. This is why we believe that no single experiment is enough to come to any conclusions. However, by sharing our videos with you, and observing their behavior collectively over the next few years, we hope that together we can come to conclusions that will help us and the rest of the world better understand and appreciate this majestic creature. We strongly believe in making this a group effort.  We hope you enjoy our content and look forward to sharing more videos with all of you."

Awwducational,fel2llo,t1_fej6s2q,1579212704.0,"Reminds me of the snake that escaped the NYC Zoo and someone set up a Twitter acct. as him.  Makes ya laugh as you cheer on the ""escapee"".  😂"

blackcats,fefe0xn,t1_fefd883,1579054313.0,"He sounds like it, from your other posts here.  I just think it's so amazing when an animal will just know they need YOU (or in your case, your son), know you'll love them and look out for them.  Too bad it's not that easy with humans."
blackcats,fefdjui,t1_fdqxz8j,1579054013.0,"That's because little dogs THINK they're big dogs and they will not back away from them.  I had an ""ankle biter"" (She was really the sweetest little pupster.  Never bit anyone).  Now if my little Mini Weenie Sassy ran across a little dog in her path?  She'd hide behind my legs.  It  was so damn funny and cute!"
blackcats,fefd171,t1_fdp6s7x,1579053681.0,What a great story!!  So glad he found your son.  🥰
blackcats,fefcxvp,t3_emiyfr,1579053622.0,Adopt her!  You know you want to.  😄
Awwducational,fefc0zt,t1_fdqnwu0,1579053023.0,"Actually, they don't.  Some researchers found they find the majority of the nuts they bury.  I think that's seriously impressive!!

Awwducational,fefb0na,t3_emkzj5,1579052357.0,"OMG, he's so pretty!  I've never seen a squirrel like this before.  Where do they live?

I feed the squirrels in our yard.  They also hang out with the cats when I've got them outside.  Not afraid of them at all."
Awwducational,fe73ikg,t1_fe6nk66,1578909519.0,"Cool.  I wasn't sure, so I asked.  It's nice to learn something new about the world.  Thanks for answering my question.  😄"
Awwducational,fe6mndu,t3_enoqfs,1578896134.0,"Wow, I didn't know this.  Do they trade up shells like hermit crabs or does the shell grow with the animal?"
Awwducational,fe6m6un,t1_fe6j6hc,1578895634.0,"Naw.  He's not a lap cat.  He's blind and deaf so it's kind of scary for him on your lap.  But he is a love muffin.  He will sit with his paws on my leg, kneading the hell outta me, while I pet him.  He does love getting ""love"". 🥰"
Awwducational,fe6epde,t1_fe2y6zo,1578888686.0,We take 2 of our cats outside so they can explore the yard and we are there with them.  My cat is blind and deaf.  Being able to give him some time outside is really special.  I know he loves it.  The other cat is my Mom's.  He guards my kitty while they're out there together.  He's such a good big brother!  It's so sweet to watch.  🥰
Awwducational,fe6e8tw,t1_fe25h07,1578888316.0,"You're right, he really is Mr. Fuzzyface.  We think he's a Norwegian cat mix, so he's all fur.  He's just a big ole 18 lb. ball of it!  😊"
Awwducational,fe0twzz,t1_fe0hqfz,1578818633.0,Please tell me that vet is no longer practicing.  What an ass!!
Awwducational,fe0tsb2,t1_fe0b95l,1578818600.0,"It's a thing here in the US because so many stupid people care more about their damn furniture than they do about the comfort and safety of their pet.  One of my Mom's cats is de-clawed (she adopted him that way) and it's so sad watching him try to scratch on cardboard boxes.  My cat has his claws and has clawed his way across the sides of my couch.  Do I care?  Nope.  I can get a new couch, I can't replace my precious Mr. Meow Meow."
Fruitbatcats,fdpodfy,t3_el3s57,1578634552.0,He just saw that chick he can't stand come through the door.  Now he's tryin' to find a way to duck outta there!

funny,fdpferx,t3_emeo57,1578627216.0,"I've never seen one like these.  I guess it's true and ""Minnesota nice"" keeps people from ripping them off.  Or I'm just blind and never noticed.  😐"
