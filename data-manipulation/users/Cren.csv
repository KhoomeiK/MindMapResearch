(Also don’t understand these posts as hate. It was my “research” that led to my conclusion; that _I_ was inferior to a pink ward.
Running to a bush expecting the enemy jungler to show up; I plop my mighty ward max range into the bush only to get three shot by the enemy Kha jungle. My pink on the other hand provided vision on him LONGER and Kha needed even two more swings. It was then that I realised that it’s justified I award less gold than my pink ward.)"
