Thank you for the many awards and entertaining comments. I’m honestly overwhelmed. To clear up a couple of things: 

1) I would love to let him/her in, but one of our dogs is an elderly retired hunting dog and attacks smaller animals. Our other two dogs are just very confused by orange cat and we don’t know how they would react to a meeting. Orange cat is much safer outside. Our neighbors are good pet owners who keep orange cat fed and happy, they just let it wander sometimes. 

2) The glass is one of two narrow panels on our front door. We have a covered front porch. So people can *technically* see in, but they would have to walk up our porch and squeeze their faces in between the trim on the panels to really see much. 

3) Orange cat shows up a couple times a week when the weather is nice, owners keep it inside once it gets cold so we probably won’t see orange cat until April now that we have snow cover. 

4) It IS sometimes a terrifying experience to walk past the door and see this thing looking in. Especially at night if our porch light is off and the cat gets glowy eyes. We are a little concerned it’s learning our routine for nefarious reasons."
aww,ffrb9sr,t1_ffravif,1580154465.0,Will try. This was just the other night. In good weather we see orange cat a couple times a week staring in. When it’s too cold his humans don’t let him out of their house.

PlusSizeFashion,ff86dzw,t3_es6b4z,1579667270.0,"I would start by creating a vision board of how you want to dress (this can totally be done digitally with Pinterest). Are there any celebrities whose style you really like? What about a celebrity that has a similar body shape? Before you go buys a whole new wardrobe work with what you have and maybe buy a few pieces that you can wear with multiple new looks. I really like using a service like StitchFix or Amazon Wardrobe to try new styles in the comfort of my own home. 

Once you find a style you like, start by just wearing it around the house. Choose a day you don’t really need to go anywhere and make yourself totally up from head to toe in a style you love. Stay home, twirl around in front of a mirror, take shameless selfies. Be totally “into” your look. Once you feel comfortable in your home go somewhere familiar to you with people you know well. Maybe even text a girlfriend ahead of time, “hey, I’m trying out a new look, but please don’t make a big deal of it because I don’t want to feel self-conscious”

Got out and have fun. Blatantly ask your husband for compliments on your style. Tell him you need some extra confidence because you’re going out of your comfort zone. 

Keep repeating this until you have developed a style that you feel is truly you."

This trip we bought sweet potatoes, lots of canned goods to make chili with, frozen vegetables (this is where I feel like I compromised because I’m normally a stickler for fresh vegetables), frozen stir fry, frozen quinoa and black bean bowls, hatch green chiles for stew, Quaker brand granola bars, a four pack of frozen pizzas, apples, grapes, naan bread, marinara sauce, coffee, bananas, LaCroix, and then Kirkland brand contact solution, makeup remover wipes, and toilet paper. 


We had just gone to Aldi a couple days before and stocked up on cheese, wine, beer, juice, and yogurt.

Pets,ff3ij0d,t3_eqx3th,1579541775.0,"I answered this on a similar post. We have three dogs, ages 12, 8, and 1. The two older ones were adopted at 1-2 years and we got the 1 year old as a tiny baby puppy (mom rejected her so we weaned her). 

When the puppy was old enough to start playing we noticed if she bit too hard or just got to rough our older dogs would scold her (growl or snap), then ignore her until she started licking their faces or showed some other sign of submission. So when we played with the puppy we would say “ow!” pretty loudly when she would bite too hard, then ignore her until she licked our hands, then resume with play. 

So - even though it’s not a scientific study - I do believe that “I accidentally hurt you, I’m so sorry, are you o.k? Can we keep playing?” Is a part of doggie language/socialization and therefore they understand when we accidentally hurt them and immediately apologize."
Pets,ff3hovt,t3_er7g2f,1579541262.0,"We noticed that when our two older dogs played with our puppy they would ignore her (after growling or snapping) if she bit too hard or got too rough.

So when we played with her, if she got too bitey or rough we would say “ow!” loudly and then ignore her until she came up and licked our hands, then we would play again.
