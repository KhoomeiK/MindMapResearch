AskReddit,ffe31t7,t3_et44un,1579835402.0,"My parents had a guardian angel dog. 

They rescued a dog named Duke and only had it a few months. My dad took the pack on a walk. This includes Duke the blue healer, a lab, a chow, a golden retriever, and a mutt. Usually Duke would run out in front of my dad with the rest of the pack. My parents live out in farm land in south Texas, aka snake country. This day Duke was walking right by dad and didn’t go with the pack. They were asking down a dirt path when a rattler lunged from the cotton plants and struck Duke. Had he not been there the snake would have hit my dad. The snake ended up being about 6 feet long and thick as a mans forearm. My parents took Duke to the vet and he got an anti venom shot. They left him there for observation as he was doing ok. A couple hours later Duke seized and passed away. The vet did some X-rays to determine what exactly happened and found that he had been shot multiple times. He had 4 bb pellets and 2 .22 bullets inside him. The vet said he’s not sure how he survived those shots. I do. He was a guardian angel sent to protect my dad from the snake. Thank you Duke."

I get being concerned about the people in your household and baby comes first. I applaud you trying to find a good place for the dog and appreciate that you haven’t dumped him. However, there are training programs available for these types of problems. Having a dog requires time just like a child. You have to train them. If you feel like they are beyond your abilities then get help. Good luck."
