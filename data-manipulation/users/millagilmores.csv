AmItheAsshole,ffaewzy,t3_escpo7,1579734091.0,"ESH. Your poor wife stuck raising two children. This is so dumb and petty. Middle names matter, they get read out at weddings, graduations, award events, etc. I knew someone who, had it not been a friend who pointed it out to him, almost received an award in front of our middle school class as ""firstname BJ lastname"". That shit will haunt your kid and embarrassing your kid when they are literally hours old is a crappy way to start parenthood."
GossipGirl,ff7x101,t3_es3haq,1579660375.0,"I agree with you. I don't buy Dan as Gossip Girl and honestly don't even accept it as canon so the whole ""Dan is a creepy stalker hahahahaha"" doesn't phase me. I think a lot of the stalker stuff got amped up because of the show ""You"" where Penn plays an actual stalker. Jokes started getting made about Dan also being a stalker and it snowballed from there."
AmItheAsshole,ff7gy06,t3_ervc1v,1579649301.0,YTA. Yes insult the child publicly in front of her peers there's no way that'll motivate her to misbehave even more. /s

college,feh1mvs,t3_ep1or8,1579107264.0,"It’s possible. I was a victim of the freshman 15 and it was because I ate so much trash. I’ve tried to eat healthier and it’s hard but possible. My biggest advice is eat in the dining halls where you swipe to enter and it’s all you can eat. I find there are more healthier and more balanced options. Also look at nutrition info, it’s easy to think something is good for you and find out it’s not. Love my campuses smoothies but I don’t love the 50+ grams of sugar in them."

college,fea9cxy,t3_eo50o7,1578945905.0,"I had a schedule like that a couple of years ago: I had 4 class on Thursdays and I was on campus from 8 am to 7:45 pm. Take advantage of any breaks you have, make sure to eat lunch and dinner, drink water, try and get a good nights sleep the night before, don't procrastinate too much on your work due that day, make sure to give yourself some downtime, and just accept it might just be a rough day but your other days are better."
lucifer,fdz2vus,t3_emy3v9,1578786112.0,"Elementary. Like Lucifer its a crime show about an eccentric British guy who has special talents and his partner who doesn't tolerate his bs but also knows him better than anyone else, and they help the cops find the bad guys sometimes using less than legal means. The humor is similar, though I think there's less sexual humor, but there's a bit of love-hate in season 1 as the two characters get to know each other and respect each other. Theres also an interesting overarching season 1 plot but don't look it up online because there's a lot of spoilers about it."

AmItheButtface,fdex2yk,t3_ekzjfv,1578348420.0,"NBH but I can see why this kinda backfired. Giving him independence is good, but honestly I can see why it might confuse someone or rub them the wrong way if they weren't expecting it. As a fellow southerner who was raised with a weird set of manners, I agree with cogitaveritas as it does seem a little rude not to stop in and say hi. Even if you don't walk in, some kind of heads up to him going in by himself probably would have been good. They may have been wondering where you were and if something happened. 

Also he was noticeably in a mood, stopping in would allow you to give them a heads up and why he was acting that way. Maybe they thought he was upset because something bad happened and that was why you deviated from normal routine or he was upset about walking himself in. 

I don't think you're a butt, I just think letting them know your plan before hand is a good idea if you want to do it again."
AmItheAsshole,fcy57le,t3_ejgtib,1578075001.0,"I'm torn between N-AH and N-TA so for now I'm going with INFO:

Have you explained all of this to her? Are you seeing anyone for your depression? How often would you be out of the house if she didn't make plans for you? 

I'm like you, I'm very much and homebody and a low-energy person. However, maybe your depression is  part of why she's trying to make plans for both of you. Maybe she's concerned about your well-being. It's easy to become isolated even with a partner and that makes everything worse. Maybe she's also feeling isolated as well. None of us know why so you two need to have a conversation and figure out why she expects you to go with her, if its out of concern for you or another reason."
AmItheAsshole,fcvaaby,t3_ej0k8d,1577997913.0,"YTA. Medical trauma is a real thing and it fucking sucks. It may not have seen like she went through something that bad to you but you don't know how she was processing it. Even with the best support system it is still a shitty and awful thing to go through and it affects everyone differently. What might not seem like a big deal to you might be a mountain to her.

Also INFO: what did she say exactly when she brought up her cancer? Could she have been using it to preface advice?

EDIT: also she might be posting about it on social media to spread awareness especially with new info about  BRCA genes and how it is heritable. That could also be why she brings it up to YOU because if its genetic you could have it too."
AmItheAsshole,fcszugy,t3_eik9di,1577929250.0,"YTA. I understand you are worried and anxious; your family dealt with a lot of stress with her medical issues and you just want to protect your child. However, your reaction is extreme, your child was not unattended she was in the bed in the same house with her parents near her. I was born with medical issues and have dealt with them all throughout childhood into adulthood. All parents stress about their child's wellbeing and it's harder when your kid already has dealt with medical issues, but you do not want to be a helicoptering, over-controlling parent. I've attended events for people with my health issues and have seen these parents and no one wins. 

You and your husband will make mistakes with your daughter. Every parent does because parenting is a challenge and everyone makes mistakes. Most mistakes are small like not bringing the baby monitor upstairs but you still have to accept stuff like that will happen in order to move past and grow. You can't play this blame game, calling him an idiot, you can be annoyed but you have to shrug it off. 

I think you need to take this ""incident"" to heart and use it as a growing experience. I highly suggest therapy to talk all of this out, especially with how your daughters health issues affected you because it sounds like you may be dealing with some trauma from it and that's okay. Maybe reach out to other parents, read up on how others parent kids with health issues. Let your husband take over some stuff and see how he wants to do things. You need to be more flexible because as you've experienced kids don't come with a set plan, things can change, and you need to be prepared for your parenting to change and adapt if needed. Good luck!!!"
AskReddit,fclth9p,t3_ehquh9,1577756069.0,"This would be an awful idea. A parenting class that people should attend to cover basics (cpr, stages of development) would be a good idea but a law to enforce it or make having a child dependent on competency would be an easy drive to eugenics. 

There was actually a case regarding a similar issue in Oregon. A couple who both had low IQs had their kids taken away from them because there was concerns about their parenting ability. The agency that had their kids taken away argued they were bad parents because they didn't read to the kid and gave him chicken nuggets. The second child was taken from them before they left the hospital.

I know many who joke about how some people shouldn't reproduce but if we have laws based on competency it causes so many more issues and will probably lead to abuse and eugenics. What makes someone competent to be a parent may vary depending on who you ask. Yeah there are some stuff we can all agree on (provides food and shelter, etc.) but the specifics is where things get messy."
