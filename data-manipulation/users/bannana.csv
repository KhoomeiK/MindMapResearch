Do you have custom ear plugs? this is the way to go IMO. Mine are made out of silicone and are easily washed and sanitized when out and about, they are made specifically to fit my ears, and they are discrete without having to wear anything over ear they are made for gun ranges and other very loud situations and work great. 

My sensitivity has gotten better over the past several years and seems to be related to my having very specific control over my environments and the sound I allow coming to me. Also diet, exercise and supplementation seem to have a large impact though my tinnitus has remained fairly constant with some fluctuations attributed to changing seasons, atmospheric conditions, anxiety levels, blood sugar levels. I try to control my physical state as much as possible since it's one of the few things I do have control over. I also just do not go to places that I know are going to be problem."
