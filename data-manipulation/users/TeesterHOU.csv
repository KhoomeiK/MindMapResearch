jacksonville,ffjzszl,t1_ffjz7vz,1580011495.0,"Hi, first off, breathe. Count to 10. Even if you make it to 5, it's a great start. Life is beautiful. It really is. You're beautiful..the sun shining tomorrow is beautiful. The dust and pollen that fall upon the humid Florida sky is beautiful. If your anxiety allow it, would you like to have coffee and tell me about it tomorrow? My treat. No one should feel this way but it's ok to feel this and but ultimately figure a way out. Sending love from one human to another."
