To start up, I practiced with soft cups for a few cycles just to see how it fits and to help guide my menstrual cup buying. I had to get 2 different cups until I found the right one, but definitely worth it!!!"

My boyfriend and I have this running joke about those Chelsea boots. He has been trying to buy me a pair but I won't wear them because they look like horse riding boots to me and I showed horses as a kid (just being petty, I really just don't like them very much). We settled on these rain boots that are kinda a punk platform hybrid version, which I was wearing. Soooo he was saying ""those horse boots look sick on you"""

This is blueberry raspberry ginger!"
Kombucha,fcw3i23,t1_fcw1ocz,1578016294.0,"What type of heater do you have? Also, do you have the stuck on thermometer or one that just goes around the bottle?"
Kombucha,fcw3g2k,t1_fcw1807,1578016257.0,"So I did 2 days and it was bubbly, but went flat after I fridged it, then I put it back in the cupboard with the heater and did 2 more days and bam!! I'm very impressed with the bubbles, it's been awhile since it started getting cold. Before the heater it was taking me about 1.5 weeks to get anywhere with it :'("
Kombucha,fcw3c8p,t1_fcvy20y,1578016184.0,I think it was $14! I unfortunately bought it from Amazon (I try to stay local but everything in moderation I guess!!) It's called the Propagate Pro heating mat! It's wonderful it comes with a little sticker thermometer and a rubber band to wrap around. I am definitely going to purchase more because I do multiple small batch brews. I also like that it's able to wrap around multiple bottles during f2. I can wrap it around about 3 gt bottles!!
