The Ulster Plantations occured during the reign of the *Scottish* king James VI (I of England). He settled protestant, *lowlander*, Scots there. They didnt immigrate to ""flee devastation"" and they were not even Highlanders for the most part.


The Highland Clearances happened in the 1700s, and 2 different types occured. The first was political, Jacobites were expelled from their lands because of their rebellions to overthrow the Hanover government and install a Stuart monarchy (the same Stuarts that James VI was of). These Jacobites were often [High Tories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Tory), religious and reactionary men who believed in the divine right of kings, so when they got over to America, many of them actually sided with the British government and fought against the anti-monarchist Americans. The second type of clearances was purely economic, the land owners (Highland chieftains or just the Husbands of a Chiefess, in the case of Sutherland) evicted their own people in order to make way for sheep grazing, for the wool industry. Either case, the bulk of these Highlanders moved to Nova Scotia in Canada, or the 13 Colonies. The British government absolutely was not sponsoring ex-Rebels to move into Ireland."

A proponent of nature over nurture he stated that ""intelligence is 80 percent nature and 20 percent nurture"" and attributed the successes of his children to genetics.[153]"
