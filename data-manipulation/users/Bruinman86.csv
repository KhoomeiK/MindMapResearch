BattlefieldV,ffidl0x,t3_etp237,1579971333.0,"Dice has punted IMO.  Seems like they have taken a minimalist approach to the game going forward, just throwing us a tides of war weapon every so often and a map or two, but totally not committing to fixing the problems with the game and the hacker situation - which is getting out of control.  If they really were committed to fixing the game, they would create a Community Test Environment (CTE) of V and really get it fixed.  Until that happens, I don't see it ever truly getting fixed.  They'll just move on to the next incarnation of BF."

cats,ff4m89b,t1_ff46u28,1579567011.0,"Mine are all hardwired.  We put an addition on 20 years ago and all of the rooms had that system, so we went back and made the older rooms hook up to that system as well. So basically they run off the house wiring but share an additional common or ""Cummunication"" wire that allows them all to warn the others of a detection.  If the power goes out, they all have a battery backup that would run them for a year. So we're covered.  We also have 2 independent CO monitors, 1 upstairs in the master bedroom and one downstairs in the living room - both where the heat sources (Monitor heater and Pellet Stove) are located.  They are loud.  So there's no missing them.  
You're smart to put them there.  Anywhere the source of CO is, definitely have one there.  It's so worth it."
cats,ff3zn2v,t1_ff3zcwi,1579552342.0,"Yes.  They can be extremely annoying when one decides to go bonkers.  For some reason this always happens at night - often in the am hours. I've also had high humidity conditions set them off as well.  despite the annoyance, i do sleep better knowing they're ready to flip out at any moment.  Be safe."
cats,ff3tkjk,t1_ff3qcjj,1579548553.0,"One help would be having smoke detectors in every room connected so they can communicate with one another.  One goes off, they all go off - buying you valuable time to get everyone out.  It's my biggest fear as well.  7 cats, 3 kids."
