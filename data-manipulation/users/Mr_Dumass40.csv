I remember a story a few years back where a girl stole her dad's turbo Porsche and crashed it into a concrete freeway overpass pillar while going like 100mph, tearing the roof off the car. They showed a picture and you could see the top of her scalp had been sheared off, the story even confirmed it. I'll never get that image out of my head, just like when I watched one of those ISIS beheading videos, that sound still haunts me."

When Gene puts on the VHS tapes to watch his old work and it looks like he's just reminiscing alone, I'm hoping we go back to that moment and you can hear a car pull up, and see the headlights, then you hear the front door open, then you see a female silhouette slowly becoming more clear and finally reveals it's Kim.

I then saw Tucker Carlson and some ""expert"" from a conservative group say it was Chuck and Nancy's fault since they were war mongering anti Americans that hated Iran and loved war.
