guns,ffkman3,t1_ffkjigq,1580025106.0,"It was a joke referencing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ospNRk2uM3U). Lawmaker writing a law on banning 'assault weapons' is asked what a barrel shroud is, as it is one of the items she is proposing to make illegal. Shockingly, she had no fucking idea.

I'm not against gun control per se. What I am against is these stupid arbitrary restrictions based on loosely and poorly defined terms. This whole 'if it's black and looks scary, it must be bad and must be banned' attitude towards gun legislation is fucking absurd. If someone is intent on doing harm, your idiot laws banning a pistol grip on a rifle, adjustable shoulder stocks, magazine size, etc, are going to matter FUCK ALL. It's not like any of these items are difficult to procure, especially when they're likely legal the next state over. I'm fine with background checks, and laws that ensure people purchasing firearms are mentally sound, but realistically, guns are an integral part of our culture, country and history. They are not going away, and the anti-gun lobby's pathetic attempts to slowly chip away at what we can and can't put on our guns, how many bullets they can hold, etc., are futile in combating gun violence. Particularly the mass shootings that these laws were kneejerked into being to prevent.

As an aside, I consider myself to be a liberal. I think the dems would do well to stop crusading against guns. Would go a long way to gaining some single-issue voters."
