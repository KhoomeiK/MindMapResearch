aww,fdsa5au,t3_emuca9,1578697882.0,This is precious.
aww,fdnm0lr,t1_fdnk0ry,1578588598.0,I wish this wasn’t true.
aww,fdnlvar,t1_fdni1oj,1578588512.0,"Or a video would be even better, if you catch him in the act."
bird,fdn1icg,t1_fdmool7,1578574419.0,No. Kiss me.
bird,fdm9inh,t3_egriqp,1578543184.0,Rigo flies away as soon as I pick up the blow dryer.
bird,fdm9cij,t3_eh32lb,1578543056.0,Our bird ate his fake friend.
bird,fdm7daz,t3_elhf2z,1578541606.0,"My parrot went nuts when he heard your birds as I played the video. It’s so cute how when the bird on the left drops the piece of food, he responds by looking down at it when such a forlorned expression."
aww,fdfuuz8,t3_ekz8iw,1578370823.0,Thank you for all you guys are doing.
ThriftStoreHauls,fd7hzyf,t3_ek3g2a,1578204833.0,Winning. Now post a picture of yourself wearing the sweatshirt while mixing batter.
aww,fd4g23u,t3_ejt762,1578167168.0,We have extra Costco whip cream left over from the holidays- will whip cream our 4 dogs and cat this evening!
gardening,fd4es2k,t3_ejzim9,1578166876.0,Would make a beautiful kitchen art piece.
crafts,fd4e68h,t3_ejzdpe,1578166782.0,You should sell your art. I’d buy it.
childfree,fd3iseg,t3_ejt9eo,1578158722.0,"I have 6 kids at home ranging from age 4-17. None are biological. 2 step kids. My brother’s stepdaughter (who has lived me the longest). 3 bio nieces. They are all very much wanted and loved. I’m now 43 and bio kids would not fit in our home, we couldn’t afford them at this point, and my husband and I are happy with our crew. The funny thing is that the 6 kids have asked over the years when my husband and I are going to have our own baby."
DoesAnybodyElse,fd3gp4q,t3_ejwoid,1578158193.0,Running. Hard to pinpoint that perfect time.
DoesAnybodyElse,fd3buq1,t1_fd21qxm,1578156759.0,"I understand. My grandmother (who is 87 and still walks 3 miles a day) was a drill team dancer back in college (in the early 1950’s). All my life she watched over what my sister and I ate, how our clothes are fitting, pinching extra skin or fat we had. She jokes about it now, but I see her look on the mirror and pinch on her extra skin and make remarks to herself. I feel kind of sad for her.  I think if your healthy, your good. It’s a physical and mental balancing act for sure."
lifehacks,fd0f9dm,t1_fd0daik,1578117965.0,I just emptied my container cabinet and threw out about 15 plastic I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter containers that looked crusty or semi-melted. My mom’s Mexican and we NEVER threw out a possibly reusable container.
lifehacks,fd0e376,t1_fczwheu,1578117509.0,Totally agree. Usually a former pickle jar.
JUSTNOMIL,fd08ybw,t1_fcyltjn,1578115403.0,"Nope. She baked by memory. She’d recite the recipe if we wanted it. Then once we questioned her when everyone realized no one could bake it correctly, she wrote it down for several of us.  I think it was her way of having one up on us. She might have given it correctly to the Dallas Cowboys, she was a fan until death did them part. She passed away right after their first game that season. She was something else."
DoesAnybodyElse,fcyddsy,t3_ejh0kf,1578078418.0,"I always think I’m just a little overweight. Then a year later I see photos of myself and think, “my goodness I was so thin, yet I thought I was fat. I’d do anything (almost) to look like that now.”  Happens every year."
AskWomen,fcyd0oo,t1_fcx61da,1578078293.0,"I’m 43 and still haven’t either. Maybe others see me as a woman, but I never felt a moment when I could say, “I’m now a woman.”  Of course I’m different than I was when I was 6, but I’m the same girl."
MealPrepSunday,fcycimg,t3_ejhvrr,1578078021.0,"I do this for 4 of our children and tell them theirs is extra special bc it’s made with love, and doesn’t hurt to throw in a Hershey’s kiss. Still cheaper, healthier and no plastic."
JUSTNOMIL,fcy9pu8,t3_eji5kj,1578076775.0,"Sounds like my great grandmother. She had an awesome applesauce cake. The recipe she gave the family wouldn’t even come out the same color and at least 8 of us tried it. She’d rejoice every Christmas when she’d bake one for each family household because she KNEW we would never be able to make it. She died at 104, stopped baking by force at 101."
offmychest,fcy8yp1,t1_fcx7btm,1578076527.0,"I don’t think in this day and age people consume the content unknowingly. People know a lot of porn is procured unwillingly or via sex trafficking, but they make excuses to themselves and others for their participation."
FoodPorn,fcxmpaj,t3_ejd0xf,1578066622.0,Now THAT’s the quintessential food porn. Thanks for sharing.
ThriftStoreHauls,fcxm8vw,t3_ejfohz,1578066320.0,Did you find any money in those deep pockets?  Lol. The dress looks expensive and very artsy/elegant. Congrats on the find.
JUSTNOMIL,fcxlz6v,t3_ejdise,1578066140.0,"When my H and I first got together, I’d have to tell him to help me with household duties, etc. he has 2 kids and they require work (as does he). His mother was visiting from out of state and heard me asking for his help with HIS kids, HIS parents, and HIM. She got onto me and said people don’t change that much and if I didn’t like how he was, I shouldn’t be with him. Fast forward 6 years: we’re married. He happily helps with nearly everything. When he doesn’t help, I ask for it and he pitches in. PEOPLE DO CHANGE. Sounds like she just did everything for him, and maybe his first wife did too. He just needed some reprogramming."
DoesAnybodyElse,fcwol0r,t3_ej9kau,1578031733.0,"Yes. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve started writing down some of the weird dreams as a soon as I wake up. It helps somehow."
confession,fcwgkwz,t1_fcwffas,1578025081.0,This is me too. I miss the days when my leg muscles were so strong I’d squat the whole time without touching any part of the toilet. Lol.
ThriftStoreHauls,fcvj1sk,t3_ej1m4n,1578003142.0,"That’s beautiful, and fits perfectly."
cats,fc1usc2,t3_efmr5y,1577330370.0,I love this. I had a brother and sister for many years!
