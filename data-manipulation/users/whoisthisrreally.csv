introvert,fgeeajn,t3_exz375,1580697567.0,Keep going! Break the cycle! I think social media is hard on everyone. I’m happy you took this steps even though it feels hard right now. I totally get it.
offmychest,fgecstt,t1_fgeblsa,1580696604.0,"Who cares? Try not to be so shallow, and maybe you’ll feel better."
offmychest,fge004w,t3_exxwxa,1580688843.0,"I’m 38. I’m aging, I have some wrinkles, and some grey hair. So what? I’m happy to look my age. You told us alllll about how you feel about yourself on the outside, but how do you feel about yourself on the inside?"
ThriftStoreHauls,fg033xu,t3_evw45t,1580399154.0,Most of my art is thrifted. I never skip that section! So cool!
ThriftStoreHauls,fg029yb,t3_evzjke,1580398621.0,I love it!
offmychest,ffb6mpo,t3_esni40,1579753202.0,"Well, I love your insights, and the way you lay out your perspective. I tend to agree with you that appearance is what people go on, despite what they say to the contrary. It’s strange to me that as a society we are not honest about that."
TrueOffMyChest,feluw10,t3_epuk11,1579231529.0,"I believe you. I’m glad things are going well for you and your child, and I hope that continues."
socialskills,fe4qvac,t3_ent3au,1578861941.0,I would just try to be honest.
CasualConversation,fd3g13p,t1_fd3dqqb,1578157962.0,"Ya, I’m really not a superstitious person. We get a lot of action on our porch for some reason, including a huge raccoon a few weeks ago (raccoons don’t live here and I’ve never seen one in real life before). Lots of rabbits, and also cats passing by and checking things out. It was just so strange how this one came and laid down for several minutes. Maybe he’s a new neighbor."
