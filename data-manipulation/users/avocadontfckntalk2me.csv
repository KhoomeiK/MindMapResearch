AskReddit,ffeib6b,t3_esy6i5,1579849152.0,"I was actually just talking about this with a woman who grew up in Belarus when it was part of the USSR. She said that she separates socialism from the dictatorship that the USSR was known for—she felt like those were two separate things that people equate. On one hand, people were terrified of the government. On the other hand, she said she never had to worry about food, shelter, or medicine; her basic needs were always covered. 

She also said that sexism was essentially nonexistent when she was growing up: the USSR just needed *bodies* for labor, it didn’t matter the gender. So she never grew up thinking women were incapable. However, she feels like a lot of women missed out on actually being feminine and being a woman, since the culture of the USSR was so severe. She thinks that one of the reasons Eastern Europe is on the forefront of beauty brands right now is because, well, they’re allowed to be. Now that Eastern European are able to be feminine, they’re embracing their femininity."

So I think people hear my story and just don’t want to face that if it can happen to me, it can happen to them. 

And my ex is somebody that people LOVE. People were sad when we broke up because they thought we were perfect. People who know him don’t want to face the fact that if he can be abusive, anybody can. 

And something I remember being mad about is thinking that, if I had been educated on how abuse isn’t just physical, maybe I would have seen it sooner. I felt like so many people had failed me. 

And I’ve wanted to be outspoken about it, but I DONT want my identity to be forged from this. I want people to know me for *me*. Not as a victim or survivor or any part of my identity that was created in response to my abuse. Because FUCK him. He doesn’t get *any* credit for who I am.

AMA,fdyaq11,t1_fdy5heo,1578777783.0,"By the grace of God, he broke up with me. I had tried to break up with him, and he wouldn’t have it. 

He was unsure of breaking it off when he did it, but I remember feeling relieved when he left. Something in me felt like it was final, so I blocked him on pretty much every social media. 

And I was fuuuuuuuuucked up for a while. It took me months to come to terms with everything. I felt like I had been going crazy for so long—he told me all the time that I made things up that he never actually did, so it took me a long time to believe myself. I wrote down a list of traumatic things he had done and fights we had, and just read them over and over to convince myself they happened. I would force myself to remember them. And then, once I had convinced myself that it all really did happen, I threw the list away. 

I was not super forthcoming with the details, my support system wasn’t great, and my therapist was largely unequipped to deal with all of this stuff (she was a grad student at the university, and she was assigned to me upon my consent—I didn’t know better). So I really had to rely on myself to work through it. I read blog posts, the DSM-V, scientific journals, and encyclopedia articles on narcissism, psychopathy, abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, and PTSD. 

And slowly I was able to piece together what happened. But for about a year, I could be triggered by anything. One time a song we liked came on the radio, and some time later I found that I had blacked out and cried on the floor of my closet. That happened a lot. Something would trigger me, and I would fully dissociate from my body with no memory of what had happened. 

Time really helped. I stopped missing the relationship, and I started enjoying not being with him. But even still, 3 years later, I find myself arguing with him in my head (sometimes I don’t even realize I’m doing it!) This doesn’t bother me too much though, since now I have a figure to blame my negative thoughts on (like how therapists urge eating disorder patients to “name” their ED). 

I have pretty much mastered all my triggers now, but every once in a while (like, maybe once a year) some undiscovered trigger will arise and I’ll have a full on dissociative episode. But they’re easier to manage, since I know what’s happening, I know it will pass, and I’m thankful for the opportunity to learn more about myself and my mental health. 

I haven’t entered into another intimate relationship, and I think half of me is truly enjoying being single, but I know that the other half doesn’t even want to deal with processing all the feelings that being in a new relationship will bring up. 

I do think I have a totally new perspective on “you have no idea what’s going on in somebody’s life.” Because *nobody* knew what was going on. Nobody even suspected it."
AMA,fdy769p,t1_fdy2aw5,1578776814.0,"Context is so so important, and people who hear stories about abusers miss a ton of the story—they only hear the overarching summary. If within the first few months I had started to be abused, I would have thought “oh this is weird, we should break up.” But it didn’t happen until probably a year in. 

The first year he was over the moon for me. It was like a classic romance movie, where he would write me letters and pick me up in his car and always wanted to be around me (which I now understand is the first step in the cycle of abuse).

But then bad days started coming. Which can be normal, everybody goes through rough times. People can be snippy, or jealous, or just don’t always act how you want them to. 

And then the really bad days came. And it seemed like we were in a rough patch. But relationships are made of 2 people, and there are 2 sides of the story, and admittedly, I did do stuff he didn’t like. 

And then the bad days stayed, but it was still on me. I knew I pushed his buttons. I should have known that if I asked him to listen to music I enjoy when were in the car, that he would get mad. It’s just one of his things. 

And then, I stopped being able to predict his reaction to things. Sometimes, I could order a coke at dinner and he wouldn’t say anything. Sometimes I would order a coke at dinner and he’d make me cry for being stupid with money and irreverent of his wishes. And that started to get scary. 

And then, almost 4 years in, I realized “it’s been like this for a while.” I realized it had been a long time since I was happy, and that I was hiding a lot of the relationship from my friends  they didn’t know the whole story, because of course they would say he’s in the wrong, they just don’t know him like I do. So I tried to break up with him, and he begged for me back, and he told me he would be better. And so we didn’t break up, and it always got bad again, but ultimately, didn’t I agree to this side of him when I took him back? 

Finally we broke up for good, and I was able to look at the relationship as a whole, rather than day-by-day as I had been. And I realized it was so much worse than I had thought. 

I also think there are some chemical responses that get formed in situations like this—I think of it almost like Stockholm syndrome. There was just so much adrenaline involved, and so many intense lows followed by intense highs. 

And it was a LOT easier to believe I was the problem, because I knew I could change. It was a whole different thing to admit that there was nothing I could do, and that this person I loved with everything I had was abusing me."

AskReddit,fdy2cap,t3_en7cn8,1578775309.0,"Pantyhose. 

They became popular in the 20s when skirts became shorter. This was the beginning of the campaign against body hair for women, and pantyhose were marketed to “smooth the limbs” of the wearer and give her hairless-looking legs to show off. 

In the 40s (during WWII), nylon and silk were rationed, meaning women couldn’t wear pantyhose anymore. So many women would shave and draw a seam on their legs with makeup to give the illusion of pantyhose. 

By the time the war was over, shaving became a cultural norm, and people continued to both shave and wear pantyhose. 

Tl:dr: pantyhose were created so that women had smooth legs without ever needing to shave, but ended up inadvertently being the reason women shave their legs."

AMA,fdxxzoe,t1_fdxueya,1578774059.0,"By reminding yourself that you *can.* Anybody can. That was the major issue with my ex, and any narcissist in general. When I would say “it hurts me when you xyz” he would automatically come back with either “you don’t appreciate the nice things I do for you,” “that shouldn’t have hurt your feelings,” or (the especially scary one that kept me in the relationship and fucked up for years after) “I never did that, you always make things up.” He never considered that he could be hurting me (he truly didn’t care), and he never stopped doing the hurtful things. 

If somebody says to you “this upsets me,” regardless of whether it was your intent, I think it’s important to apologize. Now, sometimes you may have to apologize for something that you find to be not a big deal, and you’ll have to decide if you’re compatible with a person who won’t accept when you do that specific thing. But thinking “well they just need to get over that” can be a bad sign. 

Also, remember that your opinions are not a fact. “Seinfeld is the best show of all time, and anybody who hates it is wrong or doesn’t get the point” is *not* a fact. And while that’s a trivial example, I experienced a lot more heavy “fact vs opinion” arguments, such as “women should always stay home with the baby, and they shouldn’t want careers.” Thankfully we never even got close to having kids, but it still hurt when he said that."

Advice,fd4o51k,t3_ejxjff,1578169383.0,"There’s a difference between an “incel” and somebody who is, in the literal sense, involuntarily celibate. An incel thinks women are a *problem.* Instead of feeling just lonely, they feel lonely and angry. They believe every positive action towards a woman deserves a fairly dramatic reaction (like a date or sex). 

On the other hand, a *lot* of people are involuntarily celibate. They feel like they would make a good partner, but they don’t feel like anybody owes them a relationship. They get “friendzoned”  and are okay being there—they like having friends! They are lonely, but waiting for somebody who will date them. 

That’s the distinction. Having strong feelings about unreciprocated affection is okay—however, if that feeling is anger with the object of your affection, that’s when you start becoming a “nice guy.”"
