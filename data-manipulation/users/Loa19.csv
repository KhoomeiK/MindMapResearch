Also, it’s clear that being underweight is unhealthy and only the sick-minded praise anorexia, but also being grossly obese can be just as life-threatening , which is what people need to understand."

I hid it for years and just had this complete mental health breakdown in front of my mum about it. 
I know it’s easier said than done, but you’ve just got to ignore everyone who assumes you’ve self harmed for stupid reasons , it’s your story and it’s your choice whether you want to put them straight or keep it to yourself , but don’t trap yourself in jeans and clothes you don’t want to wear because all it does is increase all these insecure feelings about your scars and I can tell you it’s not very nice feeling that way xx"
vegetarian,fekluz9,t3_epk8vq,1579202749.0,Eat what you like and just don’t let anyone shame you. I tried interviewing a vegan activist about beef and global warming but was given a lecture about why I shouldn’t eat eggs lol
