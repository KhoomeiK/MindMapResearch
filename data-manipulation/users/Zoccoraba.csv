We were on a 6 day thru hike from Nebaj to Todos Santos so we briefly popped in here to buy some of the best cheese I've ever had. I agree, the whole El Quiche and Huehue regions are stunning both in terms of culture and landscape. Walking along the Cuchumatanes mountain range feels like you've gone through a time machine."
dogswithjobs,fdo5njw,t1_fdo062z,1578599327.0,It’s supposed to be a funny caption. I actually don’t know his diet.. I’m sure his owners take care of him and don’t feed him a lot of (if any) cheese. As farmers I have a feeling they know how to care for their animals.
guatemala,fdnz549,t1_fdnxizr,1578595799.0,Yes

We only got to spend a bit of time with Queso (I don't know what his name is, but I thought it was fitting) when we stopped by the cheese farm. He lumbered over to us for pets and it was apparent that his daily routine consisted of lazing around the front entrance, greeting guests and by the looks of it eating whatever he could. I didn't see his eyeballs once, this was his face the entire time. I miss him."
guatemala,fdntv09,t1_fdnjkzm,1578592724.0,"Yes this in Acul, I don't remember the name of the farm but it was an Italian couple who moved to Guatemala to make cheese."
dogswithjobs,fdnnp64,t1_fdnavxc,1578589571.0,That’s a good idea.. except that this is the face he makes all day.
dogswithjobs,fdnnjzj,t1_fdn5cpl,1578589497.0,"No idea! Like most of the dogs in Guatemala I assume he’s a mutt. A beautiful one, at that."
