AmItheAsshole,fgnkyef,t3_ezeg0i,1580947062.0,Your ex is doing and saying whatever he can to manipulate the kids.  He is trying to show them how great he is and the only reason he didn't see them is because mom wouldn't let him.  He paid mom and she used it for herself.  He only cares about himself and wants the kids to worship him.  He is a narcissist.
