I'm trying to think of a name for the planet and the massive, advanced civilization inhabiting it. Trying to figure out if the person is standing on the planet's moon or another planet. Is he there for off-world mining purposes or scientific research. The questions are endless lol."

It goes from, ""PEDOPHILE, THROW HIM/HER IN JAIL FOREVER!!!"", to,""She's 18, it's okay it's legal and, therefore, there's nothin' wrong with that.""

meirl,ffbec3k,t3_esjyuo,1579761659.0,"Yep. I'm 15 years into a career path I chose involving electronic work because when I was 18 I thought I wanted to work with computers for the rest of my life. It turns out that I really only like playing video games on computers and now I'm a communications technician for the air force for the rest of my long... long contract. I hate my job/vocation, I have no other marketable skills, and am completely clueless as to what I'd do once I finally do get out of the military. I literally have a count down to retirement clock on my desktop at work. 10 years, 7 months, and 5 days left. Everyday I come home and am more mentally exhausted than physically, but it's enough to make it a chore to do my hobbies.

That being said, I did start Twitch streaming recently and I find that very entertaining and stimulating. I even have a few followers. I don't know what to expect with it, but I'm going to see, if over time, I can make something of it. All I know is doing what I enjoy is fulfilling and working a, ""grown-up, responsible, pragmatic-approach-to-life job"", can be tedious and boring as fuck."
