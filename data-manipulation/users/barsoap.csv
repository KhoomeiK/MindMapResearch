The key to good hot coffee is to not over-extract it: First comes aroma and caffeine, after 10-15 seconds or so all you get is bitterness and trail end caffeine. Not worth it: If you want more caffeine use more grounds and as a side-effect get more aroma. Coffee machines tend to do exactly that overextraction by constantly dripping on the same grounds over and over again, leaving most of them, at best, merely damp.

Then: Coffee should never be kept warm by a heating plate, it's going to turn stale very quickly. If you want to keep some for later, use a thermos. Thus, the two things coffee machines are supposed to do they actually suck at. Also, they're generally a bugger to clean.

Put filter in holder. Put grounds in filter. Add water (90-100C, that's a point of contention) either in one fell swoop and stir with a spoon, or first slowly so the grounds dissolve, then the rest. I prefer the spoon method, and additionally keep stirring while the coffee runs through to keep the grounds suspended. Let run through until your mug is full. Toss leftover coffee with a couple of grounds into sink, and the now quasi-dry filter into the trash. Done. All in all quicker than making a cup of tea.

Now *that* is something I can't help you with. And btw the reason why there's a difference between traditional dvorak and programmer's dvorak. And at least in Germany, pretty much no programmer uses the German layout anyway. Figures that you need {} way more often than umlauts. Please don't tell me you use non-English function names."

You can literally sed from one tape to another.

grep, then, is sed restricted to and optimised for the `g/re/p` command combination: `g`lobally, match re and `p`rint. Try `:g/re/p` in vi and be amazed that, indeed, it will print every line which contains `re`. Whether or not the `p` action makes sense in vi is kinda besides the point, every proper vi is also an ex."

Then... what do you do in your IDE when you want to replace everything up to the next close bracket with something else? Hint: `c<movement><text><enter>` does the `c`hange part, `/<pattern><enter>` moves to the next occurrence of `pattern`. And no vi doesn't use `/` for search because other programs do, other programs use `/` for search because ed/ex/vi do.

* `gg` moves to the start of the file
* `d<movement>` deletes from the cursor position to the movement's target
* `G` moves to the end of the file.

And now that you know that, and I tell you that `w` moves to the next word: What is the command to delete a word? Doesn't take a genius to figure out, now does it.

Wars don't have a unique representation each in the human (collective) unconscious, it's all general patterns.
