>After a pause in proceedings, Hanselmann was allowed to start racing again, and was given a head-start on the bunch in a bid to allow her to regain the time she had built up. However, with the break in racing and the cold conditions also playing a factor, she was soon brought back by the bunch.

* **Clear:** Hanselmann restarted 10 meters ahead of the women who were behind her.
* **Unclear:** When she says ""I got the gap again,"" it's unclear as to how long after she took off from the 10 meter head start that the riders behind her got the go ahead.

Simons on the benefits of his time squatting:

""I got a really good work ethic,"" he said, ""and I got in shape, since I had to work out every morning."" He spent about $30 a month for ""random food expenditures when I got sick of eating ramen and cereal. I could have not spent a dollar, but I was going crazy."" He had a Thanksgiving Day splurge at Boston Market. ""I only had maybe five to ten T-shirts, a pair of jeans, and a pair of shorts,"" he said, ""so it all fit in one locker. \[Plus\] they had their own laundromat there, so I'd wash my clothes there."" 

Simons on how he got caught:

""One of the guys who manages the building came in at like 5 or 6 in the morning,"" Simons lamented, ""and he scoured the entire place to find me. And he ripped me a new one. He was pissed that I was treating it like a dorm. Which was reasonable."" 

This had been his routine:

* Work until midnight or later
* Go to sleep around 2 a.m. on one of 3 couches that seemed outside the range of the typical security guard routes
* Get up no later than 8 a.m. before anyone else arrived
* Work out at the gym and take a shower
* To to the lounge for cereal and water or soda
* Then work all day"
