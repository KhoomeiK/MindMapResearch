We had an akward convo about who wanted to talk to who. Turns out he was dating another classmate and they wanted to play with me. In 9th grade a friend forged a note from a guy asking me out, and then showed him my answer. He actually was into it and we dated for a bit, but I was a prude, so he dumped me for a slutty(according to the gossip) girl. Got to go on my 1st date to a ROTC dance, so that was fun."

These books helped me tremendously when I broke up with my long term boyfriend in my early 20s.
