nonmonogamy,ffnn6sn,t1_ffnj498,1580068094.0,Hmm well there’s obviously a learning curve for me to handle. I’m going to keep my eyes and ears open and politely decline if it seems too unicorn like which is not what I am looking for. Thanks.
nonmonogamy,ffnmlab,t1_ffnkmxe,1580067908.0,Hmm that is a very good point. I am definitely not down with being just someone’s unicorn right now. I’ll keep this in mind and if something feels off I’ll politely decline and move on.
nonmonogamy,ffniuas,t1_ffnhfmb,1580066478.0,I am single they are a couple. I am just wondering about the dynamic of meeting two people that are coupled but only he is actively looking for a FWB. He says she has joined in with other partners once before but she’s mostly into him being desired by other women.
nonmonogamy,ffni94x,t1_ffnh162,1580066272.0,He says she is satisfied with what they have although one women has joined in a threesome with the two of them. He is looking for more of a FWB situation so not really romantic to begin with. I have zero expectations right now and will not be afraid to nope out of an uncomfortable situation.
nonmonogamy,ffngl0m,t1_ffnfdkl,1580065677.0,"He asked my permission, it wasn’t sprung on me. She looks adorable and they look super nice. We’re only grabbing coffee nothing too “datey” if that makes sense. Just wondering about the dynamics of a meetup of this kind."
Portland,ffc2bpe,t1_ffbyze0,1579789774.0,Yep my house is cut out too. How do they leave out almost a whole quadrant of the city?

askportland,ff3xdnd,t1_ff3v24b,1579550928.0,The lakefront sites are the most desirable but almost all of those are first come first serve. The handful that are reservable are already gone.  Thought about trying to switch when I got there but I’ve seen some reviews of people who did that and lost money. I don’t know anyone first hand who has done it.
askportland,ff3ps4c,t3_ere7ii,1579546229.0,"I work at OHSU although not in the OR. I have been here 8.5 years and love most of my coworkers but management (especially upper management) are pretty shit. Look up our last contact negotiation sessions. We almost went on strike but it seems that was the theme of last year (Kaiser, LBB, Fred Meyer). 

The patient care provided there is great and your coworkers should be good as well. As long as you go in with that knowledge I think you’ll like it."
StoppedWorking,ff2fxa7,t1_ff2ed2u,1579504439.0,Yeah poor thing looks terrified

nonmonogamy,fei5mp9,t1_fei1i04,1579130810.0,"I’m a bit of a shy introvert and I’m not a person comfortable, yet, saying this me take it or leave it. Once I build my confidence around this up I’ll have no problems but in the interim I’m just feeling this out to see if it’s right for me."
nonmonogamy,fei0zcz,t1_fei0wd8,1579127918.0,I like that thanks
nonmonogamy,fei0y65,t1_fehzvw7,1579127898.0,Oh yeah 100% would tell them before we were to even go on a date. I don’t want to waste mine or their time. I wish I wasn’t nervous about it but I want to keep my personal life outside of the workplace as much as possible.
mildlyinteresting,fehh3v1,t3_eou3j2,1579116409.0,"Yes this is Portland

mildlyinteresting,fegqhem,t1_fegqdmz,1579100139.0,Apparently a lot of people do. When you see it almost everyday it loses its “awesomeness” if that makes sense.
