Not a dog, but my cat is the biggest drama queen of any animal I've ever met. Take him to the vet? He'll ignore me the rest of the day. Not stop what I'm doing to pet him? He'll walk off in a huff. 

The most dramatic he'd ever been was when I returned from my nearly month long trip to another country. He GLARED AT ME before going to sit facing the corner."

Some of his movements do remind me of the way BCs herd sheep, but they also remind me of a foster that was thought to be Akita X Husky when she saw something ""tasty""."

The day after his diagnosis (abdominal mass displacing his organs) I went out and got him his little cake. He lived a month past diagnosis. 

My Lab mix got vanilla cheesecake frosting. He was 11, had multiple health issues, and I woke up to him crying out and unable to walk. Vet took x-rays and couldn't figure out a cause. Put him on an anti-inflammatory, steroid, and something to protect his liver. They didn't work and so I gave him some frosting and took him back to the vet. 

The vets and techs gave my Aussie a literal FEAST when his time came. Marshmallows, Easter bunnies, etc. He was under a year old and had suffered from various congenital issues starting several months after I'd adopted him. His issues were so varied and severe that multiple specialists had to consult with their colleagues all in an effort to figure out just what was happening."
dogs,fc7inro,t1_fc7hlu4,1577508622.0,"I'm planning on. 

I adopted him at the beginning of August and prior to that he'd been a stray/feral that most likely had limited human contact prior to being caught. My area has multiple Petlands, puppy stores, and BYBs of every breed imaginable, so anything is possible breed wise."
dogs,fc7hdm5,t1_fc7g2n0,1577507489.0,"Here are several of him. He's around 10-11 months old and is in near constant motion, so pics are hard to get of him.

dogs,fc7f2u0,t1_fc7ecs8,1577505515.0,"I own three small dogs that LOVE the sound of their own voice, so barking is not that big of a thing for me. Brushing is something I enjoy doing and my vet does bathes, sanitary and ""toe fur"" trimming. 

Totally off topic, but does your Italian Greyhound needtobethisclosetoyou? I have a suspected IG mix (15lbs, sight hound build, Ig-ish head and ears, thin skin, legs for miles, double suspension gallop, prey drive to the moon,etc) who will glue himself to you if you're sitting down or sleeping. This is the only dog I've ever owned without the concept of personal space."
therapydogs,fc7e164,t1_fc7cyam,1577504652.0,"Sadly, my area shelters don't do anything in the way of temperment testing. 

I live in an area where overcrowding is such a major issues that the majority of shelties pull from the animal control shelter (aka, ""kill"" shelter). The AC shelter does NOTHING outside of Rabies vaccines, and, unless the dog is actively trying to kill someone, it goes onto the adoption floor. The shelties bring in loads of new dogs every day and its sort of like a revolving door made of dogs."
dogs,fc7djyp,t1_fc7crm3,1577504265.0,">The bespectacled Keeshond always wears a smile. **This happy-go-lucky dog is affectionate and funny**. More than earning the moniker ""Velcro dog,"" he sticks closely to people and demands their attention. **He can be a good choice for families with children, tends to be friendly toward strangers**, and generally gets along well with other animals, especially if he is raised with them. 

Variations on the bolded. I also need a small-medium dog (under 60lbs) and they are the perfect size."
Keeshond,fc3xlz3,t1_fc3qo1y,1577401242.0,"I went to one last year and am planning on going to another in Feb. The one last year had only one entered, the handler was late, and I was unable to talk to them. They practically RAN into the building, quickly groomed the dog, and RAN to the ring. They didn't hang around after that. 

I think the dog has to be 2 years old before they can even take the test. Not the CGC, but the one that measures how well your dog obeys and handles novel situations."
