destiny2,ffio42b,t1_ffhxfvc,1579978532.0,Worst part is when people start pointing fingers and getting frustrated. That’s when mistakes become more common. Don’t try to rush it with a PUG.
destiny2,ffinx3l,t3_etnybi,1579978400.0,I get bent when I miss a x4 izanagi shot cause of flinch. Missing Golden gun absolutely wrecks me.
destiny2,ffibqw2,t1_ffi0245,1579970088.0,"Right. The yellow circles indicate powerful/pinnacle rewards from those activities.

Check the planets. The flashpoint is on OI this week. Big yellowish green planet on the far left."
destiny2,ffhxuqs,t1_ffhtcc4,1579958607.0,"Public events, lost sectors, heroic adventures. Look for the yellow circle next to the planets to find which planet is the flashpoint this week."
destiny2,ffht0fk,t3_etp8w8,1579952379.0,Public events offer something like 15-25% depending on heroic event or not. Lost sectors offer 10% and can be the most efficient depending on how fast you can complete/how short the sector is. I always try for heroic public events the only downside is you *may* have to wait for another event so you could toss in a lost sector if you can speed run it. Heroic adventures offer a large chunk of progress so I always try to do them on Mars/Titan where there are typically less events.

But I’ve worked on myself and forced myself to interact to show myself that it’s “not so scary”. I’ve gotten better at interacting with strangers irl and online.
