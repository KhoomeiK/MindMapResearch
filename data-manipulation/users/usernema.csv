I'm a dude, but if my brother and family pulled a similar move I wouldn't cancel; I'd just wait for them all to arrive, bar the doors, then burn the whole thing down.

Angels Envy Rye could be a good choice, it's delicious and while expensive, it is significantly cheaper than fighting murder/arson charges.
