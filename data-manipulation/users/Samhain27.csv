AskReddit,ffgw6d2,t3_etcyd6,1579916605.0,"I know it’s popular to say “men have feelings, too, let us show them,” but I kind of have some caveats with that. It may work for some, but certainly not all. 

I really don’t experience the world emotionally. All that comes secondary or tertiary to me. Since I’ve been an adult people love to tell me how I’ve been “culturally conditioned” and I’m “not really that way.” I find that to be just some of the most arrogant bullshit. 

I grew up in a family that was extremely emotionally available and liberal in many, many ways. Fortunately, I’ve been surrounded by people who share similar views. I can’t remember I time where I felt pressured to hide my emotions. Yet, I’ve never really leaned into my feelings as a mode for interpreting the world or myself. I’m not saying I’m robotically rational—I’m not—but my knee jerk reaction to crisis is to simplify things down to manageable bits and then solve it like a logic problem. 

When I was depressed in college, I had no shortage of “friends” (most women, for what it’s worth) who were ready to “empathize” with me. Except they just kept telling me to open up, to “share what I really felt.” I just didn’t have an awful lot to share. To me depression was a way of thinking, not a way of feeling. I understand that not all people experience it this way, but it is how I experienced it.

Those “friends” just made it worse, I think. People confuse empathy with emotional openness when that is really just part of the formula. Empathy is trying to understand someone from their own point of view. What these people were doing was acting emotionally intelligent to feel good about themselves. I bet they thought they were doing something good, but in reality they were just playing around. I never felt like any of them actually attempted to understand me. They TOLD me I must have “real feelings somewhere,” they TOLD ME I was “conditioned by society,” and they just ASSUMED that I was somehow a victim. 

Don’t. Do. This.

Good will doesn’t do anyone any good if you force it on people. Don’t assume anything about people. Don’t assume someone isn’t being themselves. Don’t assume they are hurting. And don’t assume you’re going to be the one to “fix” them. 

Talk to them directly. Communicate. Sometimes you won’t get the whole story, but maybe it’s not your’s to hear. Sometimes just hanging out with someone is what they need, not an impromptu therapy session.

So, yeah. I guess to wrap this up I’ll just say that as a guy who isn’t awfully emotional, this one sided behavior really pisses me off. I’m in a much healthier place nowadays, but these games people played didn’t help."

Japan or otherwise, relationships run two ways. Both people need to contribute, though that contribution is rarely a consistent 50/50 split. People fluctuate—have bad days and good days. Some days it’s 70/30. The issue is when you put an expectation on others to “chase” you. I’ve found most people don’t want to put in more than 70% in a new relationship, and certainly not consistently. Sure, there are some vibrant extroverted personalities that can run on all cylinders all the time, but I don’t think they are as common as introverted folk sometimes like to believe.

My suggestion, be a person extroverted or introverted, is to learn how to behave like the other. I’m an introvert through and through, but spent most of my undergrad period learning to fake extroversion. This has been one of the wisest choices I’ve made, in my opinion. My time learning to dance in that arena has been paid back to me a hundred fold in just three years. 

It’s tiring and bitter work, but it’s opened a lot of doors for me both socially and professionally. I’m generally a happier person for it. It does get easier over time. Just start with little things like approaching people or getting comfortable speaking in front of more than one person. 

When in doubt, be humble. And don’t confuse humility with beating oneself up publicly. I see that happen with a lot of low confidence introverts and it just comes off as awkward. By humility I mean instead saying things like “I don’t know much about this, but my opinion is...” or “I’ve never experienced that, but...” Use the same rule with self deprecating humor. You can make yourself the butt of a joke and still maintain dignity. There is a massive difference between the examples I used above and “I’m stupid so I don’t know anything about this.” That just sounds like a person doesn’t value themselves and if they don’t value themselves, why should anyone? 

This is all a bit of a tangent from Japan, but yeah, just try to be flexible. Start small and let it snowball. No harm in a little liquid courage now and then, too."

Japan has a way of forcing introspection on longtime visitors and I believe that recognizing a certain degree of transience in things is a pit stop on that path."
AskReddit,ff4u8h3,t1_ff3zp09,1579572569.0,"This really depends, I think.
I’m from rural Ohio and I’ve got five or so “social spheres” back home. Work and ex-schoolmates make up two of those. I also have a group I play table top games with and a mostly separate group I play online games with. I’ve been doing Japanese martial arts since I was 5 and they also are just essentially extended family to me. Plus the occasional trip to the local church for community service at whatnot. 

I recognize my sample size of exactly one doesn’t prove anything. I also recognize that many people don’t have the time to devote to a lot of side interests. I’ve had to work pretty hard to maintain all these hobbies and on the worst days it can feel like spinning plates. On the best days, however, it’s extremely rewarding. 

My suggestion to anyone—so long as they can responsibly take the plunge—is to just jump into a hobby. I have quite a few friends who always tell me they have this one thing they are interested in, but never pursue. I think folks really underestimate the kinds of social doors that can open for you. My life, at the very least, would be a total shell of what it is now were it not for spinning all those damn plates."
AskReddit,ff4tlro,t1_ff3qf7m,1579572140.0,"It’s definitely cultural. This kind of social breakdown is essentially coded into the culture from the beginning. By the time they reach adulthood, it’s essentially drilled into them.

For example, they have a cultural fixture called “reading the air/room.” It’s exactly what it sounds like in that in expects people to take the pulse of the mood around them. In concept, this is not so bad. It generates more consciousness for others. In practice it makes VERY lazy communicators because people just, my default, assume you will divine their thoughts and feelings. In my opinion, it also means that people rarely think about themselves as a result of this. They are so busy trying to get into the headspace of others that they rarely introspect. It produces a lot of people well into their 30’s who don’t know the first thing about themselves which, in turn, means they can’t socially “market” themselves well. 

Another example is how clubs, classrooms, and workplaces are often presented as closed spaces. My meaning being that your community is almost always “given” to you. Further, your time is almost always (over) occupied so you have little chance to expand your horizons. This sort of thing can happen outside of Japan, too, but at least personally I have made far more friends through my hobbies than at work or school. I think modern technology really should make that increasingly more plausible.

I’d have doubts about it being evolutionary or biological or something along those lines (extreme right Japanese people might want you to believe that, though). For one thing, we rarely see evolution in motion, even in nature. I suspect it’d be thrice as difficult to witness when you’re the species subconsciously changing. Second, it seems to be opposed evolution’s emphasis on survival. Remember, Japan is a culture that produces an absolutely staggering number of suicides and the social culture absolutely has a part to play there. Third, humans are a social species in which authentic humans relationships affect us so profoundly that benefits can manifest in our health and longevity. Japan “checks a box,” so you speak, in the sense that it’s a group culture, but the devil is in the details. In Japan’s case, I firmly believe they organize into groups, but this does not usually correlate into groups bound by sincere connections. Being in a group unto itself isn’t enough for humans to reap the benefits of social interaction; they must also feel accepted and have their ideas and emotions reciprocated. While I’m sure this happens in Japan, it appears to me—at least anecdotally—that it is the exception to the rule."
AskReddit,ff4s0mo,t1_ff3o2wp,1579571048.0,"For sure, I wouldn’t dispute that work culture certainly plays a role here. That said, there seems to almost be a “shaming” thing they have going on with people who DO break out.

Before living in Japan I used to think of otaku as strange in a negative way given their tendencies towards anime and games seem so extreme. I found, after living here, that there are otaku for basically anything. Sport otaku, train otaku, etc. Further, while there certainly are people who take their hobbies to unhealthy levels, most otaku to my eye just seem... really passionate? And that’s great.

I know some of my Japanese colleagues who would disagree. I have an acquaintance through another friend who is really into airplanes for whatever reason. I actually find this dude really interesting because he can basically take a plane apart in his brain and tell you how things work and the differences between models—stuff like that. It isn’t MY thing, but I find that passion, talent, and studious nature very endearing. My colleagues just find it weird.

There seems to be a bias against being “too into things.” I’m sure this all seems like a bit of a tangent, but my point here is that even if we subtract work culture from the equation, there appear to be several other cultural obstacles one would have to overcome to make sincere connections."
AskReddit,ff4qz2o,t1_ff3gxw9,1579570331.0,"I’m like 40ish minutes from Tokyo proper and that checks out. There is definitely variation from place to place.

AskReddit,ff368ay,t1_ff2xidl,1579534663.0,"This, in my opinion, is a better reflection of the issue than people not talking to one another on the streets.

Connection in Japan seems excessively predicated on someone or some institution basically forcing you into a play pen with one another. Clubs at university are a great example. Students I teach join clubs—often without much interest in the theme—solely to make friends. That isn’t so bad in a vacuum, but then you find they essentially never talk to students in their own academic department. 

The same pattern appears with companies. I know many, many Japanese people whose entire social ring is derived from work life. They marry out that pool of people, too. Again, there is nothing wrong with this by itself, but one would expect some friends to come from outside the workplace as well.

There are just so many other factors that play into the phenomenon of loneliness here. I’d guess, however, that what I’ve described above is a big reason.

So yeah, saying hello to one another on the streets is weird. What is troublesome, though, is that even when you’re sitting in a room with 15+ other students that share your academic interest... people still just never talk to each other. Or, when they do, it’s 100% confined to the classroom and is pretty superficial.

Japanese folks like to say a lot of things (most of which I essentially consider just memes at this point) like: “Japanese people are shy” and “Japanese people are private.” That is all well and good, but speaking as an introvert, eventually you have to realize if you want relationships with depth, you have to make moves. It’s just very odd to me that people will defend their misery and loneliness with “shyness” in the same breath, and then continue to wallow. 

I empathize. Socializing can be hard, but also the subtext here just seems to be “I want someone to come along and do all the social things for me” and, frankly, I wouldn’t be too motivated to be that person’s friend either. Certainly not their significant other."

history,fezmwbm,t1_fezgn2t,1579459144.0,"Can’t speak speak directly about China, but I do Premodern Japan which often follows cultural beats in a way vaguely similar to America and England. To that end, I would be entirely unsurprised if China had an equivalent to what I’m about to detail here. OP, if you know, by all means confirm or deny.

Like China, early Japan’s peasants had comparatively “little culture” to the elites. In reality, it’s simply that most of that culture was never written down. How do we know anything about it, then? The answer is simply that elites wrote about it. 

This absolutely produces bias and we can’t take everything said in their tales and writing as absolute fact. Through careful reading, however, there is plenty to be learned. By “careful reading,” I mean paying attention to the details that are presented nonchalantly, without explanation, and are generally treated as an afterthought. From this we can piece together images of the folklore.

As an aside, some people “reverse engineer” the folklore. In other words, they take modern forms of ancient arts or stories and then try to find older versions to craft a lineage that they can then extrapolate into conclusions about the past. It depends on who you talk to, but I’ve always found this methodology to be fun for speculation, but dangerous for any kind of history. It’s a method that has a tendency to encourage researchers to dream up a conclusion and then selectively cherry pick evidence to get them there. The most famous example of this is probably Ancient Aliens. They have pre-concluded “it’s aliens,” now they go out and find evidence—which is often taken out of context or drawn out of sources that have long been disqualified from academic dialogue.

That disclaimer aside, there is still plenty we can know about early folk culture. It certainly exists in a realm that is a lot more ambiguous than the “hard” history of “thus it is written, so it was.” But, then again, any historian worth their salt will tell you that plenty of documents‘ contents are worthy of exceptional skepticism. 

So Tl;Dr although biased, as it comes to us via the brush of the elite/conquerors, there are techniques used in reading the literature to extract pieces of the common folklore puzzle. I did not note it above as it felt like a given, but archeology also plays a substantial role in it as well. As to what this tells us about modern folklore in China, I can’t specifically say. Though if I were to research it, my goal would be to start with finding documentation prior to, but close to the beginning of government disruption.

edit: grammar spelling

edit 2: I was considering my approach to research and realized that the Chinese government would likely liquidate a lot of cultural documentation and artifacts. Although I doubt it’s possible they could ever get it all (this stuff has a tendency to pop up in really bizarre places), lets pretend they were capable of it. My second place to look for research would be writings that re-write or re-contextualize old folklore in accordance to the new powers that be. I assume these exist as every new regime anywhere loves writing their glorious, self congratulatory history down. In particular, I’d be looking for spots in the government narrative that get oddly specific, holes that are poorly covered over, and blatant condemnations. Usually these are clues as to what kind of tradition existed prior to the new regime. I emphasize “clues,” not “answers,” though. It’d just be a start."
todayilearned,femsg4h,t1_fem5mmr,1579268306.0,"I’d add, although it’s only tangentially related to the trains themselves, that these guys experience plenty of darkness from other questionable edges of the culture. I met a dude that ran the trains here about two years ago and he was pretty frank (which was refreshing given its Japan) that most people worry about the day they’ll be unwilling accomplices in someone’s suicide. 

Even anecdotally there is merit to that concern. I make the trip into Tokyo several times a month and I’ve been pretty desensitized to the number of times that trains have been delayed as a result of an attempt. Reports are always vague as to whether or not the suicide was successful.

So, in short, yeah the trains are amazing, but I would not want to be a conductor. It’s an Internet being Internet thing, but I think Japan gets a very selective analysis. It’s either a perfect social utopia or a backwards, oppressive place. It’d be great if more effort was put into discussing the interplay between these ends of the spectrum.

changemyview,fefd83m,t1_fee8bqh,1579053805.0,"If you’re ever in Japan, there is an excellent (horrific) section of the Edo Museum in Tokyo detailing the Tokyo firebombing campaign. (I’ll see if there is video of it online and edit this post, but it essentially shows the destruction of the city bombing wave after bombing wave. It’s a bit uncomfortable.) 

EDIT: It’s a rare day when Youtube actually has exactly what I was looking for. Here is the firebombing graphic from the Edo Museum:

https://youtu.be/Y_biWi-lXTM

I’ve been to the Hiroshima memorial as well and while both are somber and sobering, the nuclear weapons look like precision weapons in contrast to the various waves of damage dealt to Tokyo. The capital was essentially flattened. 

I think there is probably an argument to be made about total death toll given how many lives were lost as a result of radiation, but WWII tacticians and call makers had very little understanding of radiation at the time.

Although I have very little to add to the many exceptional contributions here, I’d also posit that Japan had been losing the war long before the bombs were dropped. Things were turning sour with Russia and America was literally at the doorstep of the archipelago. This, plus the firestorms in Tokyo, plus one nuclear bomb was still only enough for Japan to hesitate. 

Whether they were hesitating to surrender or not, I’m not 100%. WWII Japan isn’t really my area. That said, if you can get your hands on some of the war council minutes across the war (which are in fragmented translation), it becomes pretty apparent that there are at least two—if not many more—factions. The emperor’s power is also ambiguous. They were all radicals, but even radicalism has a spectrum. If I were to vastly oversimplify and point to a single reason why the nuclear weapons were necessary, it would be that radicalism. Bushido, while actually being pretty ahistorical, was an excellent piece of propaganda that doubled as a cult rhetoric.

EDIT: I looked around for War Council Minutes in translation, but had issues locating them. I’m certain they are out there as I used them in a course a few years back. That said, if you have Japanese proficiency, they can be found in this book (Haisen no Kiroku):

TheSilphArena,fe8qvmv,t1_fe60wmy,1578929550.0,"I think zero energy first use at half power (halved damage) might balance that out. This is one of those things I’d hope they do substantial internal testing on and then keep an eye on after release to tweak as necessary.

Although either way I think the real power of this would be less in damage and more in mid to late game baiting. At 1 shield you’re essentially guaranteeing a charge move to land. Even if it’s half damage, that’s still just free damage. If the opponent shields it for whatever reasons, then they basically assure themselves to get smacked with something much worse. 

I definitely like the premise and I think the game would be better with additions in this vein. I’d also just worry about this being a very fine line in terms of getting it right. That said, if these moves went to Pokémon who otherwise don’t have amazing movesets, it might not be a huge deal."
gaming,fe80u8n,t1_fe7n2fx,1578921103.0,"I used to think that, but after being here a long time, my opinion has altered considerably.

I’m a grad student so I’m part of a few clubs. Some people genuinely join those activists for the sake of the interest itself, but at least anecdotally the majority do not. I’ve heard reasons for getting into clubs range from: “I joined because it’s an essential part of the college experience” to “I join because the captain is cute.” Some folks even plainly state that they aren’t really interested in the hobby at all, they only joined because they thought they needed to to make friends. (As a side note, people make far fewer friends here in their major and rely mostly on club activities to fill that function—I don’t know why, every time I ask people just cite the normal “Japanese people are shy” meme.)

Now, I’m not necessarily ridiculing people’s motivations here. A lot of sincere passions start off impulsive or “superficial.” In my own hobbies, my reasons for joining and my reasons for continuing have changed drastically across my life. That being said, I think what is most telling is how few people actually continue their hobby after college. I know some graduates who haven’t so much as touched an instrument or stepped onto a mat since their college years.

Some of that can be chalked up to the work cycle (which I also think is a cultural point well overdue for re-examination). Yet, I’m left to believe that if people were really passionate about something and they spend as much time loitering in cafes as they claim, they should have little issue pursuing a hobby seriously. 

This ended up piquing my interest about a year ago and it lead me to reading some papers on Japanese club activities. Apparently they are emphasize conditioning students to obeying the authority hierarchy over whatever activity is the club’s namesake. This is to prep them for the labor force which shares the same organizational structure. (If you want the papers I read, I probably still have them on my PC so I can cite them, but I think they are locked behind JSTOR’s ridiculous paywall). 

This has been supported in my personal experiences as well. I’d expect a Shodan (black belt) in Judo to know something about the art’s history, philosophy, and it’s related sister arts. Only an extreme minority ever really can hold a discussion on these things. Their responses tend to boil down to “this is the way we do it at this university, everything else doesn’t matter.” That really implies to me, anyway, that the activity itself really isn’t the goal. If it were, people would be jumping to discuss these sorts of things or, at a bare minimum, be able to hold a conversation about it.

I will grant that people in their 40’s tend to start having more going on. But I find that’s a far cry from my home country’s situation where most of my friends had a hobby they really leaned into by their early 20’s at the latest. From early childhood till middle adulthood though, I find most people here just go through the motions. They might do thing, but the level of engagement is rather low and the motivations appear to be more directed at fitting into an in-group than a hobby for a hobby’s sake."
gaming,fe7857a,t1_fe73l45,1578911227.0,"I’m not sure if it’s cultural or not. I grew up around people whose parents were adamant that they MUST do something outside of school, though. They didn’t really care if it was games or sports or art as long as the kids had life balance and a sincere passion. 

As a result I grew up gaming, doing Japanese martial arts (now in Japan too!) since I was 5, drawing, looking into history, and most recently I discovered a love for hiking. I feel like I gel relatively well with most people because at least one of these things is likely to be of interest. And when it isn’t, I consume enough media and think about it enough to squeeze by.

So it’s very possible that I overestimate people. I don’t mean any insult to folks who don’t have hobbies either I just find them... kind of boring. Some people can get by if they are super passionate about their work. In my experience, however, people in Japan seem to not really care for work one way or the other AND don’t really do anything neat on the side. It was actually really demoralizing to learn their language to 5 years and get to a conversational level only to discover more small talk waiting for me."
gaming,fe77278,t1_fe6xqlo,1578910876.0,"Yeah in fairness I should have been more specific.

Reading, movies, consuming media can absolutely be deep. The line that delineates it from being a hobby to being a surface level pass time is the thought put into it.

For example, I have friends who can list off their favorite and least favorite authors, and ramble on for hours about the strengths and weaknesses of each. They identify themes, character archetypes, etc they really like. In other words, there is a level of engagement and analysis at play there. Even if I don’t necessarily enjoy that kind of reading (most of the reading I do is non-fiction), the amount of passion on display makes me interested in/enjoy the person more.

That’s generally not the case in Japan. It’s mostly “water cooler” talk. People like movies because they are popular or people read books because they are new. I haven’t really met anyone who really has deep dived into the media at all. It feels more like people see those things only insofar as they can use the experience to demonstrate they are a part of the in group.

That, by itself, isn’t a huge problem. Heck, I really don’t care much for American football, but I keep up on it because a lot of people in my family enjoy it. The issue is that, generally, there isn’t any depth in ANY of their hobbies. It’s all just very... going through the motions, if that makes sense. 

I’ve always wondered if that’s because their is kind of a stigma here attached to being “too into” something. Although “otaku” is a label most popularly attaches to people who are really into games and anime, it’s actually a lot more flexible than that. There are poetry otaku, sports otaku, and so on. While times are changing and the term seems to be becoming more neutral every generation (much in the way English’s “nerd” has), it’s still pretty negative. 

I have quite a few friends who say, for example, that they don’t mind having otaku friends, but they don’t really understand them or would want to have a deep relationship with them. 

There is just a really strong emphasis on “being normal” in Japan and “being normal” basically equates to living a life on rails, along generic and acceptable parameters. Other things play into it like work/study hours, but my take is that culture is at least a contributing factor here.

Hopefully that answers your question. Basically, yes, any hobby can be deep depending on one’s level of engagement. It’s simply that engagement levels in japan mostly revolve around surviving small talk with colleagues rather than implying any really profound interest."

gaming,fe6pclt,t1_fe6ntfv,1578899215.0,"It seems like people generally are really passive gamers. They like the idea of being able to turn off their phone and being able to progress (recharge whatever energy time-gating mechanic that game has).

I have zero proof, but my speculation is that Japan is sort of in the phase of gaming where it’s still not really mainstream. Some “inoffensive” titles are okay: Pokémon, Zelda, and Mario. I’m not trying to say these are bad games, by the way, just that they tend to be pretty entry level sort of experiences. 

The U.S. sometimes has people saying games make people violent despite total lack of correlation. That said, over my lifetime, at least, that kind of talk has died down considerably. In Japan, it’s still in full swing. Rather than “make you violent,” however, it just makes you a lazy, garbage person. 

I agree tons of mobile games are unapologetic money milkers, but it seems like the natural compromise for people who want to game and not be ostracized.

I don’t want to break into a larger discussion on hobbies deeply here, but I’ve noticed Japanese hobbies are comically and tragically stunted. Some people definitely maintain deep and interesting ones, but on average this does not seem to be the case. Even before someone opens their mouths, I can generally guess what their hobby or hobbies will be: shopping, reading, walking, eating, watching dramas, and listening to music. 

The culture is so bent around not standing out that I don’t think people ever get the chance to explore what they really like—many more don’t even know where to start. Long work hours as an adult and absurd study expectations as a kid also really limit time. 

The result of all of these, I believe, is a population that is conditioned to try and be as blandly inoffensive as possible with a preference for much more passive games. Or, rather, games that expect very little out of the player. Hence the gaming-lite culture.

There are, as always, extreme outliers. Otaku have a lot of hardcore gamers in their number, but they essentially represent a subculture and are not necessarily reflective of majority consensus.

EDIT: You’ll also note all the game titles I mentioned are Japanese. Japan has a weird obsession with brands—especially domestic ones. I understand that brand names can sometimes cue us into quality (need I cite EA loot boxes), but the game market in Japan is not global... like at all. The subtext there appearing to be that foreign games can’t be of Japanese quality. A lot of gamers cite silly things such as “a lack of cute girls” making games impossible to market. While there may be some merit to that interpretation, I have sincere doubts that foreign games possess zero marketability to this entire nation in particular where they’ve succeeded across other cultural lines just fine."

Honestly a lot of the stuff I’ve heard is pretty petty bullshit too imo. Reminds of high school. Other countries do it, but I think in countries like America there is always the possibility that animosities will over flow and a direct confrontation will result. Japan is basically bitching about one another in hushed whispers in perpetuity."
gaming,fe6n9nq,t1_fe6lgir,1578896806.0,"I’m living in Japan currently.

One thing I’ve found fascinating (and annoying) is they have whole polite word forms. Essentially, you can meet the culturally acceptable threshold for politeness while being real dick at the same time. It’s like passive aggression in English, but kind of one degree upwards. 

That said, I haven’t seen it much in gaming. I play on PC which is just... essentially nonexistent in Japan compared to consoles. Every time I ask why people generally respond that computers are “too confusing”. Which to me is ???? since this is a country with toilet seats that wash your butt and are one generation away from doing your taxes. It is true, however, the most of the gaming market is on phones here."

There are definitely some Chinese out there who are very willing to look the other way on anything that looks bad in them. They also, like Japan, sometimes have this weird issue where criticism of government must also mean criticism of culture.

That said, yes, I’d agree that my Chinese friends, at least, are much more willing to accept that China is not a monolithic good. I think Japanese people like that must be out there, too, I just think they never have a safe platform to discuss. I’ve tried finding those types and across 4 years can really only say I’ve found about 3-4 of them. 

I think all nations are on a bit of a self-adoration spectrum, it’s just that Japan goes hard on it most of the time, with most of the people, without much compromise.

Absolutely about the crime/trash. Had an instance where a friend was describing a poor experience with Japanese tourists in his home country. They apparently blew through like a storm and just trashed the place, leaving things everywhere. The Japanese person who was listening to this story responded: “Are you sure they were ACTUALLY Japanese you and you didn’t confuse them for some other Asian country?”

I think I would be much, much more willing to accept Japan and all of its issues if the natives did as well.  That’s really the crux of my complaints. It becomes difficult to respect a nation/culture/people when they make messes and then, like a 6 year old child, just pretend to not know anything when their parents ask who did it."
japan,fdq6slg,t1_fdq5d4e,1578657330.0,"I can’t speak to if the partying thing is real, but I’ve heard a lot of pretty similar stories. I think most of them are hyperbolic, but there are absolutely grains of truth.

I work part time in an office and it’s kind of absurd how many people work there full time just to do work that really could be filtered out with bare minimum streamlining. Like, a lot of jobs are really just a part of a job that’s been cut into pieces and been distributed across 3-5 people. It doesn’t sound awful, but it superficially bloats bureaucracy in a culture already prone to serious bureaucratic hang ups.

On top of that, a very real, very visible cultural thing is people finishing their work, but being obligated to stay at the workplace to wait for their seniors to finish. This causes folks to just linger pointlessly—not uncommonly for no pay, either. 

At my own workplace, I cannot express how many hours have been lost over my time there by people just gathering in groups and affirming with one another how difficult a situation is rather than fixing the problem. 

So while I’ve not heard the partying story, it does seem consistent with the idea of just “appearing busy”.  Timeliness and efficiency really aren’t valued. Or, if they are, they are at least subordinate to the virtues of busy work and kissing up to the your superiors."
japan,fdpyf73,t1_fdpoybo,1578645921.0,"It unfortunately still exists—I’m living here now, also doing grad school.

I’m writing broadly here as I’m sure there are exceptions. In fact, I know many people who would disagree with mainline Japanese rhetoric... it’s just that most of those people are highly intelligent and are ready to hightail it out of the country in a permanent fashion.

That said, Japan has a hard-on for itself in a way I haven’t really seen elsewhere. And I’m American, I’ve seen our brand of pro-Murica cultist. Unlike home where people will at least debate and/or be called out on such an oversimplified a worldview, here people just walk around taking Japan’s perfection as natural fact. I’m sure some people disagree, but there isn’t really a platform to dissent without inviting the likelihood you’ll be ostracized (maybe even hurt professionally). 

People are absolutely married to the idea that Japan is a peaceful, safe, efficient, empathetic, culturally distinct (superior) nation that most closely exemplifies utopia on our mortal plane. Japan never gets help from anyone. Japan never does anything wrong. Japan does not need the world—no, it’s only barely part of it. Japan isn’t like those nations and Japan is often beyond the understanding of foreign minds. 

Just ignore the bloody wars, the imported technology and tactics, and the fact that they descend from early Korean, Chinese, Siberian,  and maybe even Polynesian people. Ignore how many “traditional” fixtures of culture are relatively new inventions. 

It really drives me out of my skull. Anyone who looks to Japan as a place that the west should model itself after, I plead, look elsewhere. It’s true the trains are brilliant and the cities are (mostly) clean... but, frankly, I don’t think blindness and sedation on this scale is worth it. Ever."
japan,fdpxo0k,t1_fdprma7,1578644909.0,"I’m not sure what those country’s conviction rates are, but as a lot of news points to, Japan’s is 99%. 

The jury is still out (ha) on why this is, but this is comparable to China’s. Underlying assumption here is that if you go to court in Japan, you will lose. I’d suspect that isn’t the case for the countries you listed.

That said, I think the issue with the Japanese legal system runs deeper than inquisitorial versus adversarial. To my eye, it has more to do with completely disallowing the state to be wrong. There is quite a bit of evidence suggesting that judges who acquit in Japan are doomed to lesser careers than peers who don’t. Additionally, there are instances where individuals are sent to jail whom are essentially known to be innocent. The pattern, therefore, seems to be that either innocent people are punished or legal professionals are punished for protecting innocent people in case where folks aren’t guilty. 

To me, at least, this is a country that isn’t interested in justice or truth. They don’t even appear to necessarily interested in order, but in just saving face. Foreigners are one thing, but the fact this is the system that is entirely willing to throw its own citizens into potentially draconian prisons to do that.. well...

Japan is a country that on every level, from social to professional to governmental, seems to value images more than it does function. Take it from a guy living here—even in business the appearance that one is busy is often more valued than whether or not the work being done is useful. I think it’s the same in the legal sphere. It doesn’t matter if the system works, so long as it appears like it is without compromising the state as seeming reliable, wise, and righteous."
funny,fdkg7v2,t1_fdkbeji,1578503207.0,"Popular western ideas about the historical concept of “honor” in Japan are pretty wrong in general.

I think there is an article by Karl Friday called “Off the Warpath” that debunks a lot of the popular ideas. In summary, the “1v1 me” scenario on the battlefield is basically just romantic fiction originating from war tales (Heike monogatari). A survey of battles reveals that samurai switching sides mid-fight was very normal. You can actually scarcely find a battle where someone did not change allegiances.

The “Bushido” honor code is mostly nonsense as well. The Hagakure, from which many Bushido ideas originate, was written by a dude who was not only considered insane by his contemporaries, but never even saw battle. (I’m pretty sure this is covered in another article called “Bushido or Bull?”) The only reason it became so enduring is that the Japanese military realized its value as a unifying and motivating ideology in WWII. In reality, it probably didn’t depict what the average samurai thought at all.

We also have to remember samurai like Musashi—who is highly celebrated—were often pretty “dishonorable” in duels. Musashi is remembered for his distinct sword style, but many are quick to forget that the guy had a knack for pissing off his enemies and then killing them while they were emotionally compromised. 

Ninjas as a concept are all heavily romanticized as well. I’m not as clear on their history, but my understanding is that ninjas as they are typically imagined never really existed. Assassins existed. Covert scouts and spies existed. Hit and run attacks existed. It was unlikely, however, that there was a group of people training to do all these things and passing on a lineage of techniques. Heck, even the samurai really didn’t do that in huge numbers until after the civil wars. 

Ninjas probably represent a conflation of a lot of real tactics and then have been further romanticized and mythologized. People have, however, noticed the sheer marketability of the concept such as those in the Bujikan who, frankly, have at best cobbled together martial techniques and just smacked the ninjitsu brand on it. Needless to say, ninjas in media are a huge hit, too. 

The reality is that, in Japan and elsewhere, I think people would mostly find that the “1v1 me bro” is pretty ahistorical. Did it happen sometimes? Sure, but it must have been rare and/or just relegated to martial sports (which have existed for a very, very long time). I think people’s willingness to believe it was normal, though, is either a subconscious desire to make our heritages more agreeable or just the comforts of modern civilization clouding views.

You don’t really need to do much study to realize it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, though. A one on one fight on the battlefield as is popularly imagined  would often entail dismounting, dropping your bow,  drawing your sword, announcing yourself, and hoping the battle around you just... stops while you fight. 

Even if ninja existed in their most recognizable form, the logic of the “1v1” is pretty silly. You can bet the surprised and unarmored lord of a castle is going to call every guard in earshot to him if he’s given the chance.

Tl;Dr soldiers tended to be pricks because it opens up more chances for them to win; that’s what real combat is
