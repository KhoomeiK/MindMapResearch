If they were smart they would either make it normal to be kicked from servers for no microphones (its 2020, if you dont have a microphone as an FPS gamer, you got an issue) so people have the incentive to buy one (I remember the only reason I got a microphone years ago was to be able to play Project Reality mod when it existed).

Or they would make it so there is a massive buff of some sort to stay at least within the vicinity of a squad leader. It's always one or the other: a person with a mic but soloing across the map and trying to make callouts no one can even respond to, or people who do stay with the SL but have no way to give important info to the rest of the squad and usually make it impossible for SL to coordinate any sort of actual strategy.
