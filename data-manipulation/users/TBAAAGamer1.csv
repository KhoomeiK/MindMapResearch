MonsterHunter,fh7711z,t1_fh76hi5,1581317575.0,damage roars are entirely different. you can't nullify those. tigrex was perhaps the first monster to have a roar so powerful that being too close to it caused roughly the same damage as eating one of its charges.
Showerthoughts,fh56qx5,t3_f1943x,1581285548.0,"i work at a minimum wage job and we had a guy who literally did nothing but sit on his ass and play videogames or ride his skateboard around. the dude was mid-30s and was a total prick to the customers but because he worked graveyard the bitches that were our higher ups didn't have the courage to fire him because then they wouldn't have a guy in that spot doing the barest of bones worth of work.
he eventually got fired when somebody took the offer for a graveyard position, the douche tried to get unemployment and the office fought him tooth and nail to ensure he didn't.

it would explain why it survived to molt as xeno, it's so sturdy it can self-resurrect just by unconsciously draining bio energy post-mortem...probably as an automatic response to fatal trauma."
MonsterHunter,fh4ohdh,t1_fh4lln5,1581280647.0,"roars in the older game made sense because the combat system was much *tighter* and whiffing one attack meant whiffing an entire attack string, so spacing was paramount.

Roars sort of created tense situations where you were in a state of ""false vulnerability"" no monsters monopolized on it, but you were rooted to the spot and anything that could hit you, would. this made you more aware of smaller monsters without forcing you to worry about the large ones. and up until most small monsters ran away and hid, this was the intended purpose of the mechanic, a sort of ""Space check"" to see if you were too close or too far from a monster when it did the rage roar and whether or not you were too close to smaller aggressive monsters that could potentially inflict status ailments.

By gen U roar and sound wave mechanics were used both as a way to force spacial awareness onto the player/ put them in dangerous situations they'd have a split second to get out of.

Now...WORLD doesn't have this pretense of mercy, right off the bat the combat feels...i wanna say sloppy? like, the sense of razor tight spacing is nonexistent for the most part, you're just slapping the monster around and sometimes getting slapped back, but there's virtually no sense of ""If i dodge this then i can punish but only if i get there within the razor tight window of time to hit it"" here it's just ""that attack makes the monster go far away, it likes to do bites when i get in close, just slap it around a lot and hope it dies.""

Roars factor into this because they're less a space check and more ""Free damage for the monster"" especially elder dragons. When a teostra roars, your ass is getting slapped not two seconds later. there is no ""if i mash dodge i might avoid the following attack"" like with older games, it's just ""you should have DODGED THROUGH THE INVISIBLE NON-DAMAGING ATTACK YOU FOOL!"" it's cheap, lame, and i kinda fucking hate it.

Other situations where there are two monsters, a monster leaving the field like the zinogre will do a ""i'll get you next time"" fuck you roar, and what this amounts to is a flying pickle taking the huge window of opportunity to kill me.

Point being, roars in this game are basically a combo tool for the monster, one you must nullify by either practicing timing with dodges, which a lot of people want to do, or block, or just earplug through at the cost of damage.

In my opinion, older mh titles made roars largely pointless. I hated the mechanic back then and even though i make an argument for ""spacial awareness"" it's sorta empty because roars generally aren't a threat in classic monster hunter.

in world they're a real danger and often kinda bullshit, but i can appreciate them as an actual threat now.
So i've got mixed feelings. there are proven defenses against roars, it's just a matter of picking one.

So pick earplugs."

and i'm not talking ardyn, the real villain of the story, the TRUE villain of the story, is bahamut, confirmed by the ardyn dlc when he literally sets everything up by forcing ardyn to fall in line with his prophecy.
the story's great up until you realize that the story doesn't really have a happy ending. the sole thing that could have potentially stopped bahamut was undermined, BY bahamut's prophecy. Now humanity has absolutely no way to stop him from ruling the world or whatever he wants to do. ardyn could have literally been reasoned with, could have been saved, hell, he SHOULD have been saved. and episode ignis reveals that there are other ways to save the world while still keeping noctis alive.
