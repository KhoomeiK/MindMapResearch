You still have to pay off the loans. I swear everyone acts like I have 50k at 3% interest so I'm gonna invest and get 10% return so 5k.  That's not how it works.  You have to pay on the loan and you don't have 50k invested.

So maybe now with no trade fees in a retirement account to deal with tax drag maybe it might have have a slight edge.  But now selling vol is an extremely crowded trade.  If we look back at some of the quick larger dips the market bounced back quicker than expected at least by put prices.

But like I said here's the gist.  The spread on SPY is literally as close as it can be most days.  If it's mispriced someone could make money trading it.

I certainly think there are worse things to do than sell cc or puts.  I just don't think at least on the index side there is a misprice for all intents and purposes.  And with everyone selling vol now I half expect buy and hold to do better over the next decade but we shall see I guess."

The biggest issue I take is basically violates the whole efficient market hypothesis.  At penny spreads on SPY if selling the volatility was worth it someone should be selling the crap out of it.  Someone also has to be on the other side of the trade.  Also taxes.  They are always short term on selling. 

And finally place like the cboe always seem to use SPX instead of total return buy and hold.  They want you to trade options.  Go compare their published indexes for covered calls vs total return s and p.

I'm of the opinion delta is delta.

worldnews,fffqtta,t1_fffpuha,1579889805.0,"Reward and force is the only way to motivate people.  Capitalism rewards people greatly for huge break throughs and what the market needs.  Communism means even though Joe makes 2 widgets and I make 10 widget we get the same.  So I eventually say screw it I'll make 2 widgets also.  At that point you threaten to kill my family so I make 10 widgets again but start adding defects to them.  Any new hires know to only make 2 widgets. 

Communism never works on large scales."

Futurology,fff4aah,t1_ffeztm3,1579875317.0,No that's China.  This is easily googled.  And you will do the per capita thing to which I'll reply this.  Why does China get to have over 2 billion people?   If the USA has 6 billion people and lower per capita are you cool with that? Is increasing our population so we get economies of scale and lower per capita what we should do?

Again 0.03% vs 0 at 1 million in assets is 300 per year.   It's not a huge difference.  I don't care what you do."
investing,ffe5yc3,t1_ffe1wji,1579837574.0,Unless you trade options or need mass liquidity VOO or IVV are just fine.  No reason to pay the extra for SPY. Though on a million dollars 0.04% vs 0.09% is 500 bucks a year.  SPY trades 24/5 at tda and has lots of options volume.  Voo and ivv not so much but if you are doing buy and hold it won't really matter for you.

UpliftingNews,ffb9yoh,t1_ffb9cte,1579756745.0,">the argument of gun ownership leading to overthrowing the government is pretty laughable at this point.

We won't have to over though because the threat is there.  Many nations have overthrown their government.  We lose in nam.  We arguably lost in Afghanistan.   You think any governmental force is to control a nation with 1 gun per person?   Even Japan didn't want to invade the USA.

Listen if we can apply everything we do to the other amendments I'm fine with whatever.   Tests to own a gun then we can have tests to vote.  Test to post mass media.  We can have feed to vote as well. Or you can armend the constitution and remove it but don't act like your making any logical argument. 

I think we should have background checks for internet use and voting.  The media of today isn't what the first amendment is about. 

And then you still have the issue of removing 300 million weapons from private hands.  Best of luck with that.

And I'm fine with some compromise.  How about national ccw for background checks?   But we both know that's not what the left is trying to do.  It's about banning a class of guns used in less than 200 murders nationwide.  And then of course it won't stop there and they'll move to something else.

Anyways the 2nd can be removed and maybe that's what you need to focus on."
