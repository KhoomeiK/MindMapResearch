australia,ffulkof,t1_ffug8u3,1580244525.0,"I really appreciate your advice and taking the time to comment! I’m going to save to visit a few times before I make any decisions about moving. I completely agree that having a backup plan is so important for such a matter! I want everything to go as smoothly as possible, and wouldn’t move out there without more than enough money to keep me stable and prepared for emergencies. 
Thanks for being real and to the point! I don’t want to come off as a starry eyed kid, just eager to see the world and get out of the states!"

AskReddit,fde8kjb,t3_ekxmms,1578333544.0,"for context, this is what i had in mind when asking this question: 

last night I was on the phone with my aussie friend (and i was very high on marijuana.) i said something about how i speak softly on the phone so people don’t hear me. and then i paused, and said, ‘in my house’ and he laughed and said ‘in YOUR house’ and i felt so dumb. sometimes he has me on speakerphone, so really i could be loud to anyone. i don’t know why i had to specify that to him though. i was just high, so it could’ve been that. but damn, i feel like a dumb american.. how do you move past the dumb shit you say? or prevent it from happening? i’m
so socially awkward."
