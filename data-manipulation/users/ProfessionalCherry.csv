""For me"" does seem likely to mean some of her clothes, because otherwise why wouldn't she emphasize heavily that it was for the child, not for her?

If the person you are impeaching is guilty, then the process BY DEFINITION is not partisan.  Impeachment will always be led by the opposing party.  Thats ok, thats just how it works.  If someone is guilty, then you impeach.  If they are not, and you continue anyway, _then_ the process is a partisan shame.

We're talking about massive, nearly untraceable organizations pumping out millions of fake news stories all over your mothers facebook feed.

He said ""They’re just using the law as a political weapon against Trump, just as Brazilian élites are using it against Lula.""

Screenplays are a different art form than stage plays, and those are a different art form than novels.  French New Wave filmmakers litigated this question at length in Cahiers du cinéma.

It was relentlessly minimalist and emotional, in order to be true to the one thing that mattered: stirring up emotions.

There are lots of things that you could say are wrong with tipping that are verifiable.  For example, as noted in the article, despite the fact that tipped servers average decent wages (because of high end restaurants), the average wage at a place like Applebees is $9/hr.  This is verifiable fact.  Or another fact is that people of colour tend to both earn less in tips, and get worse service from tipped employees.  This is partly due to racism, and partly a continuation of the problem that poverty is unequal across races.  So tipping exacerbates some underlying systemic issues.
