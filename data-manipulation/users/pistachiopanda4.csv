sex,fffbvj1,t1_fff9lcb,1579880544.0,"Yeah, my boyfriend knows when I come because he makes me squirt 99 percent of the time. He's recently been able to hit my g spot and make me cum that way with his fingers. *I* needed a goddamn manual to make myself cum. I didnt know how until I realized I had been making myself cum for months. And I've cum twice with 2 partners total before my current partner. Girls are not like guys when they cum. Like the top comment explains, it varies wildly."
ChoosingBeggars,fffaxln,t1_ffeo05f,1579879940.0,"When I was homeless back in 2016 and living out of a suitcase, I had to use the laundromat. It's annoying to deal with but if you find a decent one in your area, you have your routine down. I always brought a book and bought donut holes from the shop next door to keep me occupied. It did suck because doing my whole laundry was about 5 dollars every time but I had no choice. I also have hand washed a couple shirts and air dried them when needed to. I never folded my clothes at the laundromat, only at home, but I bought a hand steamer so I could keep my clothes nice and wrinkle free. I live somewhere with laundry in the house and it's nice now."

AmItheAsshole,ffdzh37,t1_ffdfms0,1579832795.0,"Growing up and going to Vegas, me and my 2 siblings would share a bed and my parents would share the other bed. We would sleep so we were parallel with the headboard. It was fine because we are all pretty small. And sometimes, my parents would be out all night so we could sleep sprawled out. At a certain age, my brother started sleeping on the couch in the room. OP's family can do it, and OP and his girlfriend can have their own separate room."

AmItheAsshole,ffaczjd,t1_ff9etyx,1579732636.0,She had an exit strategy (aka another guy) to the relationship while he was rearing up to move in with her and grow with her. That's just so shitty.
AmItheAsshole,ffacnu9,t1_ff9f3h2,1579732415.0,"They were about to move in together right, and have been together for 3 years before breaking up? The break up probably hit the guy like a train. Your friend was obviously checked out of the relationship but that's not how her ex boyfriend saw it, or maybe he ignored her not being as into him because of young love naivety. She has no obligation to stay with him, but her exit strategy was shitty as hell. They both are better off and obviously would not last, but I dont know why she acts so shocked. 

When I was in high school, I dated this guy for a year. I have felt regret over this relationship for my entire life. I really liked him but I dont think I loved him, especially as much as he loved me. I was his first almost everything. Like your friend, I had crushes and infatuations on a few people throughout dating my ex. But instead of feeling confident to leave the relationship, I felt shitty, and still do feel shitty, because it felt like I led my ex on for so long. I tried to make it work but I was with him one day and I knew, deep in my heart, that the best thing was to break up with him. It took me a long time to do it. I wasnt in the best place mentally, and because he didnt go to my school, I broke up with him over the phone. We became friends a year or so after we graduated high school, but he still held a torch for me. I couldn't in good conscience keep being his friend and I haven't talked to him in 2 and half years.

I think your friend kind of knows in her heart that what she did was even just a little shitty to do. I know I've sought validation for my own wrongdoings. I hope both of your friends get into a better place, mature, and love someone else with all they have in them."
unpopularopinion,ff97eii,t3_esajvh,1579706581.0,"I've been going to the gym for the past 3 months. I LOVE seeing people work their ass off at the gym.

This dude next to me has been running for more than 20 minutes, maybe I can become better and be able to do THAT."" I've gone enough and consistently to see the regulars at my gym, and its amazing seeing what people can do. People watching is just a thing you cant not do since my gym is large.

I am already making plans in my head of how the day is going to go down, because more than likely, he will go to the wedding to help out in the morning and I'll go before the ceremony starts somewhere in the afternoon. I didnt even think I could ever be in a wedding where I didnt know either of the couple well enough. I love my boyfriend's soon to be married best friend but I haven't gotten the opportunity to be friends with his future wife. I was actually surprised that my boyfriend's sister asked me to be a bridesmaid for her wedding, as I've only been dating her brother for 2 years. I was actually so flattered, and my boyfriend is going to be a groomsman, so we can both be a support on that day."

If, God forbid, my boyfriend wants kids, he should leave me and go somewhere else to have kids."
AmItheAsshole,ff119sq,t1_ff0xef9,1579474261.0,"Honestly? As a woman, it's super shitty to knowingly marry a man, agree to get an abortion if I get pregnant, and then not follow through with it. And then be surprised that he wants a divorce when I want to keep the child. I honestly think the wife is a huge asshole, and in an unpopular opinion, she is choosing an unborn child instead of her husband. That is just so fucking shitty."
AskMen,ff0931b,t1_fey3mly,1579466516.0,"Dude, my boyfriend acts gay with his male best friends all the time. Even with his brother. It's just funny shit that they do. One of my boyfriend's best friends jokingly tries to ""take my man away"" when we're hanging out. Maybe I'm used to it because that's how me and my siblings/cousins would joke around, but I didnt really find anything offensive. The only thing I was kind of shocked by was at the first time I met him, his other best friend told my boyfriend to kill himself. They all have very dark sense of humor as I came to find out and it hasn't bothered me since."
AmItheAsshole,fexlybw,t1_few4058,1579433162.0,"I'm a bisexual woman. During my teenage years, 99 percent of my girl crushes were with straight girls. I held out hope but never confessed because, well, I knew they were straight and it wasnt even worth doing the confession. One of my friends actually messaged me a little over 2 years back and asked me if I had a crush on her, and why I didnt tell her. Her sexuality was firmly hetero and so I did not bother her or make her uncomfortable. She was exploring bisexuality at that point in time and I said, ""Good for you! It will be hard because some girls will be straight, but you can find girls who do reciprocate."" And I left it at that. I'm shocked someone would even try to confess their feelings to someone they absolutely, positively KNOW is not sexually attracted to their gender. A close friend at that, it seems! Its mind boggling."
AmItheAsshole,fexksuj,t1_fex7t3f,1579432601.0,"I agree with funding your education, but me personally, my parents arent nearly as bad as OP's parents and I wont let my parents spend a damn dime on anything big financially in the future because money always came with strings attached and they contributed to trauma that I went through when I was pre teen to adult. I'm funding my own education and anything else because I refuse to have my parents be attached to my success now."
AskReddit,fewdd34,t1_fesoxe7,1579408722.0,"My last console I had was an XBOX 360 that my dad bought when we were financially stable and able. Me and my siblings also all had Frankenstein'd computers from my dad's computer graveyard from his work but I had Windows XP up until 2015. In late 2018, I bought a PS4 bundle from Black Friday that came with the Spiderman game. I didnt even have a TV in my room beforehand (had moved out with roommates in summer of 2017). It was incredibly amazing to be able to play video games again, and with an up to date console. I have been to busy too play for the past 6 months, but man, it's so nice. The bundle was such a steal for 299 dollars. I still haven't gotten PS Plus because THAT is some rich people thing, imo, but maybe in the future."
AmItheAsshole,fen699x,t1_fen0zav,1579277892.0,"It's not in my nature to be confrontational, and I'm also easily dismissed in my family due to me being one of the youngest amongst my cousins. I dont think I would ""have a go"", more just tell the person that they are crossing lines and being snippy because they're grieving and their actions might have unintended consequences due to that. I'm reading more and maybe OP and his girlfriend should sit down and talk, be mature about it and let each other know how they're feeling. This thread has been more insightful, especially that one person who talked about direct vs passive communicators."
AmItheAsshole,fen5xic,t1_fen471u,1579277688.0,"Thank you man. This was really helpful and insightful to read. My therapist talked me through this a couple years back to but I still feel guilt and loathing.

AmItheAsshole,femzp1b,t1_femy0su,1579273684.0,"Maybe I'm reactionary as well, and very defensive. I dunno if I could be as empathetic as what you described. I think I would understand maybe if my partner grieving pushed me away or little or said something slightly hurtful, but to attack my tone? And to kick me out because I wasnt enthusiastic enough to saying yes to go to your father's funeral? There are things I would forgive after an apology and with OP's situation, I dont know if could forgive in the long run. Maybe forgive to keep the peace for a while but I would definitely get checked out of the relationship. This is something that would affect me and bother me for a long time. 

I think it's also because me and my ex best friend parted ways because she didnt like my tone when I was trying to plan out a trip with her and our old friends. I was texting and making arrangements so we didnt have to all pay for parking in the group chat, and my EXBFF texted me and told me my friends thought I was being pushy and aggressive. I literally could not figure out what I had said, but I had been not a nice person to my EXBFF and so I let it go. They're all still friends and I followed one girl on Instagram up until a couple months ago where it just wasnt bearable to me. I lost 3 friendships because of my tone, and I'm still baffled as to what I did. The other 2 girls didnt ever come forward and talk to me about it, although one of them did text me a couple months after the incident. My EXBFF also tried talking to me again last year because she was lonely and had no friends. I was so relieved up until I figured out what was going on and I just moved on and didnt talk to her ever again."

I've seen my cousins being utterly distraught after losing their dad, one of them trying resuscitate their dad after his heart attack. My family has been shitty through their grief too, my aforementioned cousins expecting my sister who worked 2 jobs at the time to call off work when she cant and giving her the cold shoulder because she didnt drop off everything for the funeral.

It was also in the middle of the week and I had to take a half day off from work. I love my partner and his support, but I understand his obligations too. It baffles me that the girlfriend is so offended that OP was conflicted that he had to choose between being the best man for his childhood best friend's wedding and his girlfriend's father's funeral.

If anything would happen and my partner had an obligation to go do, I would absolutely tell him to go do the obligation and support me later. My uncle died last month and my partner didnt go with me to the viewing because he was taking care of his dad who literally cant walk without being in excruciating pain. He's waiting on knee surgery. I cant make my partner do anything and he has no ties or bonds to my family. It would be great for him to support me, but I want to do what's best for both of our interests.

It's such a shitty situation that the relationship is basically down the toilet. GF and her mom think OP is a huge asshole now, and they literally kicked him out after he AGREED to go to the funeral. Once everything dies down and you look at everything, I wouldn't be able to forgive the GF for being so shitty to me when it was a difficult situation to be in, in the first place. I get it.

I did my mile in 14:30 the other day and it felt amazing. I feel so much better than the crap I used to always feel. Therapists a couple years back always suggested fitness to help me with my depression and anxiety, and it works for me. I can focus and feel accomplished with exercise, get a routine in, have something to keep my mind occupied. Although I'm way bigger than I want to be, I feel amazing and attractive. Just gotta lose the weight because I'm technically very overweight for my height (5 foot, CW 158 ish). So hopefully I'm learning better habits, not emotionally overeating, and getting fit as well!"

Now that I'm on a restricted diet (OMAD, some days fasting now) thinking about how I ate before disgusts me. I would literally buy fast food and eat it at home in my bed because I was so ashamed that I was indulging in a 1700 calorie meal in one sitting. My boyfriend feels guilty for encouraging me the last 2 years we've been dating, but ultimately, it was my actions that made me gain 40 pounds. I'm down 6 lbs and 34 lbs from my goal weight but I will never go back to utter gluttony again. Maybe as a treat for a buffet or AYCE Korean barbecue place but that's it. And even then, I dont have the stomach capacity anymore to handle it."
confession,fek39f1,t3_epfs80,1579191683.0,"OP I have to tell you something. Please dont feel bad because you now recognize your wrongdoings. My brother was also like you, but way worse. He touched my sister's breasts in her sleep and she threatened to beat his ass. She was 6 years older and much bigger. That didnt stop my brother from turning onto me and using me for sexual pleasure, causing me to be sexually abused from ages 9 to 14 (I was younger than him). My childhood is blurry because of these memories my mind does not allow me to see. My mom normalized this because apparently, my uncles did it to her. And I later found out my cousin, who I used to adore, had molested my sister. It was rampant sexual abuse in my family. 

You are not anything like that and you recognized your actions as soon as possible. I know you feel guilt, maybe therapy is an option, but please dont continue feeling ashamed."
AmItheAsshole,fe8n492,t1_fe8e83t,1578928158.0,"I felt for OP SOO freaking badly because my ex before my current partner ghosted me. I was a wreck and had an emotional breakdown after because it was the shit cherry on top of a shit sundae. Most of my other friends I lost because of something or another and I was realizing my own toxic nature. It sent me down a spiral of feeling worthless because I never found out the reason why he stopped talking to me. It's been years since then but I always wondered what I would do if I ever stumbled upon him again. Ignoring him seems the best option, if I could muster it. But reading through the comments, I'm so appalled that OP is stretching the truth. Being ghosted on is horrible and gut wrenching, especially if you've been formally a couple."
AmItheAsshole,fe68pwp,t1_fe2mbjd,1578884243.0,"I have been getting Brazilian waxes for nearly 2 and a half years. I have a high pain tolerance and am pretty good at handling hot wax on my cooch. About a year and a half ago, the receptionists had asked me, ""There are extra aestiticians that are getting hands on experience at the end of their training. Would you be willing to have them train from your waxer?"" I said sure! There were 2 extra gals in there who watched over the main waxer as she explained the different strips she would do, and what areas to focus on repeating. I was glad to be of help to the trainees. I believe they both did a couple hot wax strips and pulls but really only on non sensitive parts (pubic mound and inside thigh). Mostly, they were observers and had tons of questions, obviously nervous about hurting their clients. How the beautician in this post thought it was appropriate for the receptionist to ""experiment"" without approval is baffling."
AmItheAsshole,fe16snn,t1_fdxn00q,1578823140.0,"Hey OP. I dont want to scare you or anything but I want to tell you something.

I worshipped my dad growing up. My older sister was always ""daddy's little girl"" but I was also the one who was a carbon copy of my dad. He has sacrificed so much for his family. He worked full time while working on a degree. He worked at a job he hated so he could put food on the table. He's done that a couple of times.

But it wasnt until 2 and a half years ago that I saw the cracks. My dad was a controlling and mean person. He quit his job and didnt find work for nearly 5 years, leaving my disabled half blind mother to work a shit job that paid less than minimum wage. That same job had a client that stressed her out so much, she had a stroke. I love my dad, he did a lot, but I dont like him anymore. My mom always told me, ""He does these things out of love."" I dont think its loving to threaten your kids that they're going to jail for a harmless thing or threatening to throw their mattresses into the streets. Hell, when he quit his job, it was spur of the moment and he didnt have an exit plan. It led to us being homeless and me wanting to kill myself because I felt like a burden. My brother sexually assaulted me and nothing was done, except for a knob with a lock being installed onto my door. And my parents continued to have my brother live with us, have me lie to CPS, and make my life torture until I got out. Every time my mom tells me my dad loves me, I always think, does he love us when he brings an outside trash bin up to my sister's room and dump all her stuff in there? Does he love us when he treats me simultaneously like a child who cant do anything and adult who needs to grow the fuck up? Does he love us when he chooses the person who groomed and abused his youngest child?

I dont know what your kids are like and how they are affected by it. So ask them. My dad was angry for most of my teenage years and I will never forgive him for his actions and words at the time.

ETA: My dad was so depressed in that 5 year time span of being unemployed, and it manifested so much into anger. Please see the signs with your husband about his depression if your kids are saying he's mean. Counseling needs to happen now. Your husband and your family and you could heal."

The fillings vary wildly but the base is always meat, carrot, cabbage, water chestnuts and seasonings, mostly just salt and pepper. That's my recipe. We usually cook them cocktail style too, where they're basically bite sized. The veggie lumpia usually substitutes meat with bean sprouts and is equally as delicious. You roll a small amount in a wrapper, roll it up like a burrito and then fry it. I usually dont deep fry it, just do a small amount and flip to brown on both sides. The filling should be 90 percent cooked. There's good recipes online but it is a time consuming process.

I asked her if she felt awkward doing Brazilians and she said, ""The first time yes, but not because the person was naked, but because I didnt want to hurt them."" The comment that the waxer made in the OP sounds like a young foreign woman who probably came from a culture that talked nonchalantly like that. Of course, not everyone is gonna be comfortable with that, but I'm not gonna clutch my pearls and complain about sexual harassment. I'm gonna politely tell the woman that I found the comment funny and flattering, but please be careful here in America as other people might be offended. I'm saying this as a woman who has been sexually harassed and sexually abused. Brazilian waxers look at cooch ALL fucking day."
