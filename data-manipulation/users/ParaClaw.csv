forexposure,fewlm3i,t1_few6yay,1579413753.0,This is more lucrative if the artist who steals such content has any money at all. Aaron is facing eviction and foreclosure of his home after failing to pay any of its property taxes / mortgage. Begs his fans for dollar donations on YouTube and generally doesn't deliver any of the merch people pay for either. He even has some GoFundMe trying to raise enough money to keep his house while claiming he actually has millions that he just hasn't received yet. He is an absolute train wreck.

James Safechuck could not had been abused at a train station that didn't exist until 1994 when he alleges he had sex daily up there in 1988-1989. There is NO evidence to backup any of their claims and the only ones that can be factually reviewed end up completely disproven.

They are a disgrace to actual abuse victims and currently owe the estate over $70,000 in legal fees after six years of failed ligitation hoping for a quick cash-out settlement (after Wade was denied a job in 2011 working for the estate on their profitable MJ tribute show in Vegas)."
aww,fci04zq,t1_fcckxiu,1577656171.0,"Two men have been trying for more than half a decade to get millions from MJ's very lucrative estate via civil lawsuits and shared attorneys, by suddenly claiming abuse.

They secretly worked with a tabloid film director (of ""Super Sperm Donors"" and ""The Pedophile Hunter"" fame) to create a film telling their ""truths"" in hopes of bolstering their public image and appeals process, since both cases were tossed by a judge.

This film never sought any of the records or rebuttal materials from MJ's side and the stories told by the accusers have been factually debunked including from their own statements and depositions and other public records: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXOfz1YkWeA"
aww,fchyrye,t1_fcck10n,1577655706.0,"And then watch any of the factual rebuttal documentaries that use deposition videos, court transcripts and discovery documents to dispel all of it. Those two men have been trying unsuccessfully for six years to get hundreds of millions from the estate.

James Safechuck claims in that film he was abused at the train station, which didn't exist until six years after his timeline and two years after he swears all abuse ended. Whoops. He also says MJ and his attorneys were threatening him to testify in 2005 but in reality he was excluded by the judge early on in the case and the defense had no intent of ever calling him since no allegations were raised about him in court and he had previously testified for MJ in 94.

Wade Robson begged the estate for a job to direct the MJ Cirque show in Vegas after being on the brink of foreclosure and without any other income, and they declined. He sold all his valuable MJ possessions quietly at auction and then decided to write a book suddenly claiming abuse--he tried shopping it to three publishers but nobody was interested. It was only then that he realized maybe he could get a quick cash-out by claiming abuse to the estate (under seal) but the estate refused and is still actively fighting it. The court judge found he lied even in his filings in claiming he was unaware of the estate until 2013 when he had worked directly with them as early as 2009 when working on tribute projects.

Seriously it is a load of BS and no different than the fake 9/11 survivor who made her way to the top of survivor support groups pretending to be one of them.

aww,fchxxpi,t1_fcdmclr,1577655431.0,"It was MJ's nature to allow his guests to have the more comfortable sleeping arrangements, including letting them sleep on the bed if they wanted and he'd usually take the floor or a cot. There were also times where kids and adults would fall asleep somewhere in his two story bedroom or on opposite sides of his humongous bed. Culkin explained it best to Larry King one time:

> KING: What did happen?
> 
> CULKIN: Nothing happened. You know, nothing really. I mean, we played video games. We, you know, played at his amusement park.
> 
> KING: Did he sleep in the bed?
> 
> CULKIN: The thing is with that whole thing, oh, you slept in the same bedroom as him. It's like, I don't think you understand, Michael Jackson's bedroom is two stories and it has like three bathrooms and this and that. So, when I slept in his bedroom, yes, but you understand the whole scenario. And the thing is with Michael he's not good as explaining himself and he never really has been, because he's not a very social person. You're talking about someone who has been sheltered and sheltering himself also for the last like 30 years. And so, he's not very good at communicating to people and not good at conveying what he's actually trying to say to you. So, when he says something like that people -- he doesn't quite understand why people react the way that they do.
> 
> KING: Why do you think he likes young people so much?
> 
> CULKIN: Because the same reason why he liked me, was the fact that I didn't care who he was. That was the thing. I talked to him like he was a normal human being and kids do that to him because he's Michael Jackson the pop singer, but he's not the God, the ""king of pop"" or anything like that. He's just a guy who is actually very kid- like himself and wants to go out there and wants to play video games with you.

MJ was warned by Chris Tucker that the family in that video you link were manipulative and conniving, so MJ attempted to distance himself from them after that. They also tried to go after Jay Leno who said he felt they were ""looking for a mark"" and cut them off. It was only when the mom realized MJ wouldn't be her cash cow anymore that suddenly they ran to a civil attorney ($$$) and eventually spawned the allegations. The allegations were completely bizarre and the prosecutor had to change the timelines to make anything match up with reality, it fell apart completely in court."
aww,fchw5sv,t1_fccditp,1577654841.0,"He had actually lifted all of his kids up to wave to the fans below throughout that day, but the bit with the baby definitely solidified the ""crazy lunatic"" image of him in the mid-2000s. I think he also was under a lot of anxiety because Martin Bashir was with him at the moment deceiving him for a special (that triggered the 2003 allegations and Bashir admitted after MJ died he had lied and misled him to make a sensational special)."
aww,fchuwrg,t1_fccaz2k,1577654435.0,"His autopsy confirmed that he suffered from both vitiligo *and* lupus. Two really debilitating conditions for someone who was also the most public and recognizable figure in the past century. Even after that official confirmation (and after MJ acknowledged he had the disease in 1993) you still see many believe he merely ""bleached his skin and wanted to be white.""

In fact there was also a newscaster [Lee Thomas](http://bp3.blogger.com/_2sZR372Vshw/R8N1J4ubRCI/AAAAAAAAAu0/1HJPmIp1NP0/s1600-h/lee+thomas.jpg) who suffered vitiligo and wrote a book about it. He acknowledged that once the disease consumes more than 80% of skin pigmentation it makes more sense to switch to light makeup and skin treatments than to try to continue applying dark makeup to make the natural skin."
Documentaries,fc16xl6,t3_efahnz,1577310004.0,"There has never been any evidence toward Michael Jackson's guilt but plenty towards his innocence. The only accusers during his lifetime (or rather, their parents) all ran to high profile civil attorneys instead of authorities. It is no surprise that they did this only after sensing their cash cow was distancing himself from them. Evan Chandler, for instance, had previously tried getting MJ to fund four film projects for him at $20M and when MJ refused suddenly came the allegations. Evan then tried suing MJ, Disney, Lisa Marie and hundreds of others a couple years later for another 60 million and to produce a musical album while actively avoiding getting involved in any criminal trial to get actual justice against the proclaimed abuser.

Here is a new documentary released this year that does a deep dive into the 1993 case file. Square One - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxNDb2PVcoM 

The Arvizo case (the only other accusation in MJ's life that led to police investigation) was completely absurd even to the prosecution. They alleged that MJ never abused the boy seen in the Martin Bashir documentary in all the years he had known him, until the very moment the special aired on TV and only then MJ began assaulting him. When the entire world was watching. Tom Sneddon wound up in a problem when it was discovered the family also interviewed with child social workers and even participated in a second film defending MJ that they never disclosed, so Tom Sneddon shifted the entire timeline to just after all of that evidence and then tried to claim false imprisonment (including the mother claiming she was going to be whisked away in a hot air balloon, and claiming she was imprisoned while actually freely shopping around California and getting bikini waxes). The family was a fraud, the mother had previously gotten her kids to lie and extort money from JC Penney after shoplifting and then claiming they abused them (which also evolved until the mother claimed they were fondling her breasts.)

In 2013, years after MJ's death, Wade Robson suddenly claimed after 20 years of very public support of MJ including twice under oath that MJ had abused him. Except what he didn't reveal was that he only made these allegations after facing crippling debt and on the brink of foreclosure, and only after he begged the MJ estate for a job to choreograph MJ:ONE in Las Vegas and they rejected him in favor of a more relevant talent. He had sold all of his valuable MJ items around that time to try and avoid foreclosure, and ultimately had to sell his house and move in 2013 at the same time he filed a civil suit seeking untold millions. He filed this initially hoping for a quick payout from the estate but they have fought it for seven years now and it fell apart completely. James Safechuck is the only other accuser who was recruited by Wade's attorneys and he has alleged abuse at specific locations that didn't exist until years after the all alleged abuse ended according to his own sworn affidavits.

Here is another about these two that relies on deposition, court filings, legal documents and discovery to show the other side of their claims not seen in their heavily edited and admittedly one-sided HBO special: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXOfz1YkWeA"
