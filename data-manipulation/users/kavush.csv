TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fehsp6n,t3_ep4wr0,1579123106.0,"I have more than 1000 messages on whatsapp because I refuse to open work groups or texts from my bosses. Sometimes I take days even up to a week to deal with it (I work from home) even other texts wait ie my dating life is in shambles. I like emails though, mostly invites haha. Point is, I get you. Join the anxiety evasion movement. Take it one step at a time and know you cant control what happens but you can control how you react. And it's been overdone but the truth is if it wont matter in 5 years dont let it stress you now; read the stress inducing email and feel the feels for a min then let it pass. Breathe it away."
