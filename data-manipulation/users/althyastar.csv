Showerthoughts,fdnc4vu,t1_fdm9kiy,1578582603.0,"I noticed something in your story that is reminiscent of how I am, so if you're wondering about your wife's perspective it might be that she's really scared to bring the subject up to you because she's worried about how you'll react. So if she let's you know before hand that there's something on her mind that she wants to talk about, it keeps her on the hook about it so she can't chicken out and keep it bottled up for another long amount of time. I try not to do this with my boyfriend, but sometimes things are too scary to address all at once and I need him to help me get it out. Not to say that's a healthy way of acting necessarily, but freaking out about this sentence might not be a healthy mindset either. We all have our things that terrify us."

In my experience it can actually be cheaper just to buy the whole book new rather than a used edition and an access code, but each book is different and YMMV. Also, sometimes the access code comes with an online copy of the book so definitely check that as you can save money that way. I would definitely avoid any access code sale that isn't direct from the publisher though because that sounds sketchy."

Usually because they actually have to do stuff with their hands and machines and the like. So the joke is that he dressed slightly nicer than usual and that was tuxedo-level for an engineer.

That's quite a generalization. I personally grew up knowing I loved the taste of hard liquor because my dad would literally give me a tiny sip of ""arnica"" (hippy medicine with some type of liquor in it, not sure what) to calm me down when I was crying. I pretty much don't drink now because I tried it and wasn't a huge fan of being drunk. But I will occasionally have some rum or whiskey or etc because I legitimately like the taste, either by itself or in a cocktail of some kind."

A 3.8 isn't bad at all, but if you feel like you're not on top of your study skills then you'll struggle when your classes actually get harder. I wouldn't freak out, it's okay to learn to study now. Do NOT give up, it's only your first semester, keep trying and make yourself try even when you don't have the motivation. Don't worry about your major, just take classes that will count towards any majors Gen Ed's and see what piques your interest. If you decide college isn't for you after next semester, then it's not for you, but you have to give it a serious try. I took a few years off before I found out what I really want to do and now school is actually exciting, which it never was before. Not everyone should go to college straight out of high school, and I believe that taking a few years to myself was the best thing I ever did."

It's just an extra measure of safety, and we've found our stopping point, and the world hasn't ended. I don't see why a roaming stop sign that's out for ~30 mins of the day really grinds people's gears so much. I really would be interested to see some statistics on what's considered safer in the long run. I would venture a guess that stop signs on school busses are safer *as long as* parents don't teach their kids to be dumbasses about crossing the road.

You don't tell them they can cross without looking when the bus stops, you tell them they have to look every time they cross regardless of where they are.
