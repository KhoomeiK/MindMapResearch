She once listed the various types and what she refers to them as... And I decided I would never do a chart like this. The wife actually wrote out a chart once of her orgasm types. I should try to find it and post it if I can find the notebook she used."

This isn't really true... 1ms latency with dropped packets on a 10half link will never outpace 1000full on a link from Tokyo to New York.
