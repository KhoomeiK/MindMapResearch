AskVet,fet76wx,t1_fesv7zn,1579372420.0,This - obviously don't go bombs away and get yourself black listed..honestly is best and has always worked for me when raising complaints.
AskVet,fesiqe0,t3_eqicof,1579365648.0,"That's ridiculous, are they a chain or independent. If a chain, I'draise a complaint with their head office. Or you could even speak to the practice manager - use social media as a tool to assist you aka leave bad reviews (only do this if you're planning on leaving though ofc.) And spread the word to locals.

If not I'd play it by ear and if you feel the treatment your pet is getting is bad then I'd move ASAP. 

Are their any other specialists, in that field, nearby?"
cats,fdjtayd,t1_fdjq15q,1578486745.0,Yeah it does look very weird due to that. Just shows how thick her coat is.
cats,fdjt9fl,t1_fdjsnw8,1578486702.0,"Thanks. No, we get her from a rescue centre - she was being looked after by a foster carer before we took her. 

I can imagine so, she probably has a few characteristics from different cat ""breeds""(""types""?).. either way she is a gorgeous looking kitten..I can't wait to see how she grows."
cats,fdjpj51,t1_fdjp8c0,1578482313.0,No no that's just where she was spayed. She's all healthy :-)
cats,fdjkws6,t3_elldfc,1578475734.0,"Our late cat was like this, when my girlfriend stayed home due to depression and just cried in bed all day, he would come and sit with her all day and sleep alongside her. I love cats that do this."
AMA,fdh2jwo,t1_fdgp9jp,1578413999.0,Slayyyyymama
AMA,fdgmp5w,t1_fdglgtq,1578402463.0,"Life is good in general. I'm hoping this year will be a bit better than last year. Life is going in the right direction though..I just need to get back to good health and on track with my money. 

How's your life going?"
cats,fdgiu9k,t1_fdfrlgg,1578398596.0,"My girlfriend and I made a similar decision when our cat stopped eating due to an adverse reaction to thyroid medication alongside a few other horrible things. 

We made the decision that it would be in his best interest to go into a peaceful sleep forever. We miss him everyday. 

Take comfort that you gave your cat an amazing life. She is gorgeous and you should be proud. You're making the right decision and will realise this once the grief has calmed down. 

All the best."
AMA,fdgiibf,t1_fdgff0g,1578398216.0,"Yep :-) 

They have some fantastic buildings over there, I love their architecture. Especially Amsterdam. I imagine they treat their windmills very well for them to last that long."
AMA,fdgebql,t1_fdge700,1578392760.0,I may add it to my list! Just watching The Witcher ATM tho. Loving it so far.
AMA,fdge9c6,t1_fdgdzp4,1578392666.0,"Ah cool, that sounds interesting but also mentally difficult. I did a bit of coding at college years ago, it was fun but I got twitchy from sitting down so much. I feel your pain.

Yes that's true, if the building is listed then you need permission to alter it. It depends on what you are altering. Some people don't get permission and then if they get caught they can be fined and also an order can be put on them to fix the building/revert it back.

The one we are working on at the moment was served a notice to change it as it changed the character. 


They are built using more wood, traditional materials and a lot of lime based products. They are usually breathable but many people ruin this characteristic by painting/decorating with modern materials. It causes moisture to get stuck and rot from the inside out."
AMA,fdge1ai,t1_fdgdrjp,1578392346.0,Is it worth watching?
AMA,fdgdy5u,t1_fdgdv21,1578392222.0,"It depends if you are working as self employed or on the ""books"". If you're on the books then you're usually okay. But the sector I work in is struggling for labour because there are no young people entering the trade. 

I'm the youngest person on site, most are 45+ and have been doing it years and years."
AMA,fdgdspl,t1_fdgdqa9,1578392008.0,"I haven't been doing it long. But it was a job I did on the side recently. It was a reed ceiling that was from around 1300. 

What do you develop?"
AMA,fdgdo6e,t1_fdgdlc6,1578391825.0,I'm a lime plasterer. I repair very old buildings but it's winter and the site is slow right now. Most people are older than me so they take long breaks etc. They know how to play the game lol.
AMA,fdgdly3,t1_fdgdl3c,1578391735.0,Nope sorry. I've been with my gf for the past 4 years
AMA,fdgdjva,t1_fdgdipw,1578391652.0,"Never, what is it about?"
AMA,fdgdj2a,t1_fdgdhk4,1578391619.0,What do you do?
cats,fcwhy4b,t1_fcwhgr6,1578026095.0,This is the way
Petloss,fc52ulv,t3_eg76bq,1577440253.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss my friend. Bob is in heaven now relaxing by the gates for when you arrive. 

I know it hurts, but don't blame yourself as you are so far from the truth.

Take care."
Petloss,fbxx8ev,t3_ecnjaf,1577202853.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss. My gf and I just lost our cat Louie on Friday after he was PTS due to a mixture of conditions. 

Take comfort that Ashe had a good life and was happy with you. It's horrible that these things happen and it always leaves you beating yourself up with guilt that you couldn't have done something sooner. 

My heart still aches for Louie and I'm sure yours aches for Ashe. We will meet them again.

We have our other cat name Nora, she is a bundle of joy but seems lonely and bored now without her big brother Louie. We're going to re-home a cat towards the new year so she has another friend."
