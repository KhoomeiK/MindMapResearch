That isn't the only thing they're doing to save money, but it is something that they're doing.

The books are all great on their own, but there's another level to them once you start reading more and more of his works.  That would include the two different eras of Mistborn, the Stormlight Archive, Elantris, a number of short stories, anything in those series' in the future, and some series' he hasn't even started writing yet, are all included.

MaliciousCompliance,ffc20cj,t1_ffbhprt,1579789538.0,"I'm sure I learned why in baking class, but I've honestly forgotten by now.

u/RedactedByElves is correct that often butter and sugar are creamed together, but that has more to do with using the crystalline structure of the sugar to cut into the fat, allowing for more air incorporation.

So I looked online to see why.  The [consensus](https://www.finecooking.com/article/how-is-sugar-wet) seems to be that sugar is considered a wet ingredient because it will dissolve in the wet ingredients.  If the sugar is added to the wet ingredients it will also change the water molecules and make gluten formation less likely.  Most of the time in baking you only want gluten formed when you're making bread.  When you're making quickbreads, and muffins, and pancakes, and cakes, etc, you want to limit the amount of gluten formed to keep the texture correct.  So you keep the water molecules busy with the sugar while still being able to add liquid in so your baked good is moist."

Now, in my opinion a plane doesn't get hot enough to melt frosting, and it's not something that I would consider a liquid. But, in baking, when you're told to do something with the wet ingredients and something else with the dry ingredients, both sugar and fat are considered wet ingredients.  Maybe the TSA just listened too much to the bakers."

I also did when the bus was full and I had a dislocated elbow and couldn't hold on to the strap over my head for balance.

I've also done it when the bus was empty when I got on, but I knew it would be extremely full when it got to my stop, and sitting closer to the front would make it easier to get off.  Because I could sit wherever I wanted.   The special seating is a guideline, not a law.

And if someone with a cane, or someone on crutches, or someone with a small child, or someone older, or someone with a knee brace, or anyone else who looked like they needed a seat got on the bus, when I didn't need it, I immediately stood up and offered them the seat.

If it's the same in other countries, just sitting there isn't doing anything wrong.  Sitting there when there's someone who needs the seats is, but there's no reason not to make use of the seats just in case someone gets on.

Also, aside from the wheelchair seating, on all the public transportation I've been on, a singular person can't be asked to vacate the seats for someone else to give up the seats, due to invisible disabilities.  They can ask everyone sitting in priority seating if someone can give up the seats, but they can't look at someone who appears to be healthy, young, strong, childless, etc, and say ""hey, this person with crutches just got on, you need to stand up until the bus clears out more.""

OfficeDepot,feozl2a,t1_feoxdad,1579308827.0,"I don't find ""buy something in June, get your rewards at some point in July, and they'll expire at the end of September,"" that convoluted.  When I explain it that way most of my customers understand it as well.  Give real examples instead of vague words.  There needs to be time for the system to tabulate how many rewards everyone earns.  The fact that promo rewards aren't on the same schedule as other rewards I find odd, but most customers don't realize the promo rewards operate on a different schedule than regular rewards, and if they buy their batteries in June, they use the promo rewards in July instead of the day after they bought their batteries in June.

The reason why people ""never get any rewards"" is because they don't recycle cartridges and don't spend $150 in a month.  If they recycled 2 cartridges and spent $10 they'd earn rewards.  If they spent $150 they'd earn rewards.  I don't think many of our non-business customers are spending $150 in a month unless they have expensive inks.

The fact that people feel like they don't get rewards, or that it's a needlessly complex system, is why my GM has created LMP coupons to use for rewards members.

I would like the system more if rewards worked the way they do in a grocery store.  Having a rewards card gives you the sale price.  They can still do promos like 100% back on batteries or 20% back on ink, if they want, but the benefit to having rewards should be immediate and tangible instead of the fairly nebulous way it works now (which is why my manager's coupon works).  I also think that teacher rewards should automatically give the 5% back to school for whichever school they're associated with, and give an additional 5% off whichever items qualify for the 5% back to school program, whether it's on sale or not."

They have to spend at least $10 a month to earn rewards (you cannot just recycle cartridges, you have to buy stuff too), and there's no payout for under $3.   They also do not earn rewards on things that they're spending rewards on (you can not use rewards to make more rewards).  VIP members (people who have spent at least $500 in a year) earn 5% back on ink, toner, and CPD.

If you return something that someone used rewards to pay for it with, they get the money back on a gift/merch card.  If you return something that went towards the rewards that someone already spent (ie, you bought batteries to get 100% back in rewards, and then you spend the rewards, and then you return the batteries) the rewards get taken away and the balance can be negative.

Rewards get issued within 30 days of the end of the calendar month that they were earned in, with the exception of promo rewards.  Not 30 days after the purchase, nor the first day of the following month, but if they bought something in June, they'd receive the rewards sometime in July, I've noticed it's usually towards the middle of the month.  Promo rewards (like 100% back on batteries) are issued the day immediately following a purchase.  They expire 2 months later.

And I do get what you're saying, but after 5th grade, when we started math that wasn't all multiplication, I taught myself my multiplication tables my way, and it's way I still multiply things.  Anything times 12, I figured it out by the face on a clock (or two clock faces, or however many I needed).  Anything times 9, I just multiplied the number by ten, then took the number away from the product.  Anything times 7 (except 8), I just added 3x and 4x the number.

There are ways to learn math without rote memorization, and you get just as fast at it as you do at something you had memorized.  IT's like learning to read, where at first you sound out the words, but once you know the word you can see it and know what it says.  I puzzled out my multiplication tables once they weren't being shoved down my throat, and by high school you couldn't tell that I struggled with multiplication tables at all.

Math went from being my favorite subject to my least favorite subject in 4th and 5th grade, and by 7th grade it was my favorite subject again, and the only difference was that I wasn't doing flash cards every night, and writing out my multiplication tables a dozen times a week, to try to drill something into my head in a way that I struggled with learning."

Math was easy until it wasn't, like the person above me, then it was easy again.  I was admitting that it might not have continued to be easy if I'd continued to take math classes after high school, despite the fact that it got easy again after middle school.  If I'd taken higher level math in college, I might have instead been saying that rather than math getting easy again after multiplication tables, that the multiplication tables were just a sign of how difficult math would end up being eventually."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdtrhqy,t1_fdszlij,1578721059.0,"Math was a puzzle, and I was good with puzzles, and so I was good at math.  

Then I had to learn my multiplication tables.  That was rote memorization.  We had timed tests, where we had to write out the multiplication tables to 12x12 (some of 4th grade math and most of 5th grade math was just multiplication tables).  After X amount of time we'd be told to put our pencils down and whatever we hadn't written down would be wrong.  I didn't have time to do the math the way I would do it, and memorizing was difficult.  So math got really really really hard.

Then I got past multiplication tables, and I got good at math again.  Most people in high school (when I was in high school, I don't know about nowadays with common core math) were either good at algebra or geometry.  I was good at both, and at the more mathematical parts of chemistry class like balancing equations.  I wasn't amazing at math or anything, but it went back to being a puzzle that I could figure out instead of just needing to know something.

I didn't try any higher level math, so I might have gotten bad at it again with enough time."
Damnthatsinteresting,fdssmkg,t1_fdsgkj5,1578707417.0,"It's special foil.  The toner has to be dark black (although I'm not sure if rich black which is a mixture of colors and blacker than black is better or worse than just 100% black) and super even, so the smoother your paper is, the better (ie, 32 lb will be better than 24 lb, or a nice semi-gloss will be better than a regular sheet of paper).  Vector artwork is preferred because it will keep the black solid without feathering.  And the laminating machine needs to be at the proper temperature. 

 I was also surprised they didn't use a carrier when they ran it through the laminator.  My small laminator at work uses a carrier (although the ones we sell on the floor don't use one, as we learned when we had to pull one off the floor when our laminating machine broke and we were waiting for a replacement), and the carrier helps even out the temperature so there's no super hot spots, and it protects the rollers from some damage.  I'd be mad if my sheet went in slightly uneven, and the foil rolled on the edges, and ended up sticking to the rollers."

All cereals are high in carbohydrates (because they're grains, ie carbs), but as far as simple sugars go the majority of the cereals we were allowed to eat growing up were very low. A lot of the sugar that people get from cereal is actually either from the milk (12 grams of sugar in a cup of [2% milk](https://www.nutritionix.com/food/2-milk)) or the sugar that they sprinkle on top of plainer cereals (1 teaspoon of [sugar](https://www.nutritionix.com/food/sugar) is 4.2 grams, I don't know how much people normally put on cereal).

We ate our cereal dry, and without added sugar, in my house, so 1.2 grams of sugar in a cup of Cheerios was definitely less than in the cereals my classmates were eating.  There were outliers of course, but for the most part I was getting much less sugar in my morning breakfast than most people I knew growing up. Also less calcium and vitamins A & D, but...less sugar.

Anyway, Cheerios is the cereal on this list with the least amount of sugar.  I'm not sure why you think it'd be full of sugar.  I invite you to find a cereal that has less sugar in it, even."
