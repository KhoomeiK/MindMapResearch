AskReddit,fdmahlf,t3_elzbiv,1578543924.0,It’s cold and you instantly know if you have holes in your boots. Pretty when it’s falling. Heavy when you have to shovel it. If it’s wet enough you can roll it into a ball for winter fun. Too much of it under your car can make it stuck and you have to shovel it out until you and helpful neighbours can push it out. I think every time I’ve ever had to shovel a car out helpful neighbours have shown up to help push.

AskReddit,fdhtzoc,t3_eled64,1578430118.0,On /r/askreddit there are too many hypothetical scenarios. Some are interesting but most are stupid. I don’t care what some random stranger would do if they were offered a million dollars but had to do something annoying or embarrassing to get it.
