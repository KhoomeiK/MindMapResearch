Trust champ it was coveyed. 
With that being said, sometimes their reaction is valid and noteworthy as signals that they aren't too far gone and/or what must be done next.

It's frustrating yeah but you literally dealing with people that have willingly placed themselves in a void."
todayilearned,ff21ohs,t1_ff20kvf,1579491408.0,"Okay. Everything you said is true but it's also not the end all be all either.

The operative phrasing in your counterstatement was ""hide in plain sight"". It's not only that people ignore what doesn't effect them, that's too innocent and general a concept. It's also that people ignore the loss and the withholding to others if it ensures their access to. (And neither take into account that those conducting such acts after the fact usually bury their evidence.)

Why aren't these facts taught widely in just everyday regular school? Because they go against the general lesson plan of indoctrination into the belief of America the Great Ideal. (Which it still CAN be.) Anytime a pertinent fact isn't taught or omitted is still a lie and who fights against an ideal that they believe to represent good accurately?

So yes you're accurate but again we both were."

todayilearned,ff1zdy3,t1_ff1yi4m,1579489737.0,..any form of oppression and/or gamesmanship never is. Otherwise such behavior wouldn't be systematically possible with such consistency and accuracy.
nsfw_gifs,fdktt78,t1_fdktktm,1578511014.0,Essentially.. just don't say it as lame as you tryin to make it sound. Ask shawty if she's cool with physical sex play like whatever the fuck you talking about.
science,fdcwgig,t1_fdcp73r,1578286314.0,"In a loosely connected observation, this type of behavior/phenomenon is exactly why I personally don't believe in any gender specific form of toxicity. (There's only toxic behaviors, who exhibits them and how they manifest is really of no consequence.) Each gender has seemingly inherent behaviors foreign to the opposing gender and/or destructive to themselves that otherwise really has no rational explanation beyond said toxicity/negativity itself.

My moms used to tell me that she felt more comfortable as a Black woman dealing with the misogyny and overt racism of her white male coworkers than a room of women peers that weren't her sisters. I didn't really get it until I got older and started to pay attention to how the women I cared for and/or dated interacted with other women. To me watching it, it always seemed like women (and I don't mean to inappropriately generalize) were always one shortcutting comment from disaster. 

The only thing I can really liken it to is, (to me) women interacting is like how social media operates, just without the screens. All the same ""rules"" seemingly apply. 

To this day sporadically, I watch my wife and daughters literally alter their beliefs, plans, statements, decisions, dress, etc. to accommodate and potentially remove these (and often hypothetical) notions and impending cutting statements about who and/or what they are. These are very strong women mind you, but even in that strength they seemingly are ALWAYS on guard for this impending verbal onslaught regarding their very being.

As a man that genuinely tries to understand, it's weird to watch."
