The perfomance by Christian Bale is on another level, the story is thrilling and its constant hopping between the cocaine feuled dinner meetings of the wall street broker and the psychotic ultra violent mind of Patrick Bateman provides for lots of interesting discussions and theories.

patientgamers,fe05jxu,t3_en6s7t,1578803585.0,"Nioh is the best souls-like game, r/gaming is a shit pile of low effort karmawhoring, r/gamingcirclejerk likes to think like it's way better but it's still plagued with the same low effort shit and people with some sort of superiority complex even though they will brigade any sub that disagrees with them.

Almost every online game has a toxic playerbase, not sure why.

Red dead 2 is kinda shit in terms of mission design and playing as John in the end stops me from wanting to play past the end because Arthur is just a more compelling character.

FragileWhiteRedditor,fdp2g4n,t1_fdn8ue8,1578618408.0,He really shouldn't have to study each account to see if it's satirical or not. If the comment is kinda racist and the frequent subs match up it's safe to assume it's serious

AskReddit,fdi4f63,t3_eled64,1578435544.0,"The repetitive questions, the superiority complex that most redditors seem to have, the celebrity worship, the echo chamber conversations, the constant reposts that somehow get onto the front page after being posted 200 times, the comments that somehow are always in every thread ( r/everyfuckingthread) the gif load time when you have even a little below average Internet.
