todayilearned,fg507bv,t1_fg46dxr,1580515107.0,I felt mine the morning of 6am. Not sooner. I knew something was wrong by it I couldn't place it. It ruptured that night as they took me into surgery.  All because my sergeant didn't believe that something was wrong and let me go to sick bay. Instead we went and cleared a fake city and ran drills and shit all day. Worst pain ever.

TwoXChromosomes,ffh58k8,t1_ffh4syx,1579923464.0,Awe you saw it. Thank you yes it was very rough but so much better now and totally worth it. I deleted it bc I kinda felt like the first part was helpful and I should've just stopped there. Don't wanna talk over your story  :)

Best of luck with ass holes."

AskMen,ffdw204,t3_esruuu,1579830345.0,"My husband keeps his on always, never takes it off for anything. ( he hasn't had any medical procedures. ) This is also why he requested a cheaper ring. It's a $25 tungsten ring from Amazon.  I bought about 4 to start with. He's on #3. He tends to lose it in the lake when we swim. He just comes home gets another out of the drawer and moves on.
I take mine of to crochet and sleep. I sleep on my hands so they tend to swell. I only wear my thin band at work. (Dental) when we go out or whatever I wear my full set. On the times I forget and don't have anything, I'll look at my hand and say ""oh no I forgot to put on my ring. ""  he always responds with,  ""oh no I guess we must not be married now! /s "" it always makes me laugh."
Damnthatsinteresting,feesonm,t3_eokgqq,1579040374.0,Always ask for an itemized statement when dealing with hospital and insurance.  They add stupid stiff on there like $40 for touching your baby. You can argue these charges and have them dropped.  You will limb be making lots of phone calls and possibly paperwork. But you can always appeal charges.
Damnthatsinteresting,fees8ze,t1_fedlkv0,1579040112.0,"Yes they are. I am an insurance coordinator in our dental office, fucking terrible. People yell at me all the time about how it's crap, all I can do is tell them to talk to their insurance and it's out of my control. 
Needless to say we stiffed on a lot of Bill's. Even worse is the dental insurance companies won't give you a definitive answer on what things will cost. It's an estimate, that way they can get out of it later if something else comes up."

MadeMeSmile,febe1hr,t3_eo73dn,1578957876.0,"So true to be kind. My parents told me my singing was awful as a kid. I still somehow ended up in choir for 4 years and then sang back up for my college ministry team.
I would NEVER sing alone and still to this day (I'm 32) I will not let anyone hear me sing. My husband will sneak into our bathroom while I sing in the shower. He swears I have a decent voice and wants me to sing to him. (nothing amazing but not as bad as I think.) I still don't believe I can sing well."
