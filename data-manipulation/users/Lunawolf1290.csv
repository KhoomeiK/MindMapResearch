depression,fefttkx,t3_eosokn,1579064997.0,Ya I get that when I was younger I had two friends we were a group we did everything together but then a new cool more interesting girl moved into the neighborhood and they stopped coming over and talking to me I was out of our little group of three. It hurt so much I stopped trusting people as much and I probably have only two close friends.
depression,feftim6,t1_fefsiz2,1579064736.0,No I’m just saying he stopped answering 6 hours ago. Suicide is never the answer. Since he stopped answering he either is sleeping off the feeling (which I hope is the situation) or sadly he did what he said he would do.
Vent,fefsvty,t3_eostx0,1579064194.0,"Ya 2019 wasn’t my year I get it. I lost four rabbits, one ferret, both of my bearded dragons, my cousin was murdered by a ship mate my cousin was only 19 years old and was serving in the coast guard( he was a very good person that would have made this world a better place), my great aunt died, My hedgehog lost control of her legs and has a giant tumor on her chest she is 6 so she is pretty old for a hedgehog and my childhood dog Samson died at the age of 17years old we had him since I was two. So I definitely understand a year being ruined or horrible 2019 was probably my worst one so far. Don’t give up things can get better stay positive. This year just began it can change for the best my thoughts are with you and your mom."
depression,fefseob,t1_fefs4iv,1579063795.0,Op stopped answering comments six hours ago if he actually did it he probably did it six hours ago
AskVet,fefr82q,t3_eoumol,1579062865.0,I’m only starting to study to be a vet tech but ik enough to say take them to the vet where they will do many tests including parvovirus even if the puppy got the vaccine when they were younger their immune system is not 100% equipped to prevent pravo that is why it isn’t recommended to take your puppy anywhere public till after they finish vaccines around 16weeks.
Vent,fef95uz,t1_feeigdt,1579051126.0,Like my boyfriend is usually good about it but recently has just be sucked into video games it’s his one flaw. I think he was sorry because I swept all the dirt and dog fur in a pile around his desk that way he has to sweep it into a dust pan before he is able to play video games. He wasn’t upset with me doing this because he knows I only usually get pissy when it involves my shepherd (my shepherd is my 75 pound baby lol)
medical_advice,fcujmok,t1_fcttcgo,1577982503.0,Ok thank you I just wasn’t sure I have never had a burn like this before
