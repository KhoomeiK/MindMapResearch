Wellthatsucks,ff5d2sc,t3_erkpjt,1579587877.0,"That is such a bummer!! Realtor here, things like this is why I buy my clients a 1 year home warranty. Because the first year of owning a home is tough enough without surprise repairs and Murphy’s Law is a bitch. I hope you have since changed your locks! Don’t know who else has your keys. And congratulations on the new home!!!"
AskReddit,ff5cuad,t1_ff5c8j6,1579587621.0,"No way would I (or could I, it’s been to long legally) now. But when I admitted it to my parents I was within the 8 year statute of limitations. Even if I could still now, I wouldn’t. It would be way too stressful on my husband and kids and I to go through that."
AskReddit,ff5c6wc,t1_ff5bdvb,1579586930.0,Crazy!! But the best way to guarantee her niece would befriend you.
AskReddit,ff5c0h2,t1_ff5bj7p,1579586745.0,"Exactly. It wouldn’t change anything at this point. When I admitted what happened to my parents, my dad told me I could press charges but I was almost to the statute of limitations. He was an attorney and warned me I would have to testify and it would be my word against his. I decided not to go through that. 

I did look his name up in the sex offender registry and he was not listed in any of the states he lived in so I don’t think he was ever charged for anything."
HomeImprovement,ff5bl3v,t1_ff5bdyo,1579586306.0,They are just horrible and pushy. I am a realtor so I had a bunch of preferred contractors in my phone for give me a second opinion. Could you call your realtor you used for a referral for a reputable company?
AskReddit,ff5bf5j,t1_ff5b20u,1579586142.0,"Right?? Makes me wonder what he was doing to her. I just can’t imagine. They lived way out in the woods with no plumbing or indoor power. Totally poor and off the grid. Mom was a single mom to the two, dad had left them when they were little. Mom still breastfed the 6 year old at night. Such a bizarre family. I found them on Facebook a while back. Didn’t message either one of them, but sister is educated and a school counselor. Her brother is a construction contractor. They are not Facebook friends, which makes me even more suspicious he was abusing her too. And no, I didn’t message either person, nor will I. My former counselor is long dead from cancer."
HomeImprovement,ff5b4af,t3_ernqv2,1579585841.0,"DeBella by chance? They came door to door, said my room immediately needed replaced, were there for 4 hours and their quote was 20k. They have called 3-4 times a day every day for 6 weeks. I finally blocked them. Got a quote from a company I trust. 10k and he said I probably have another 5-7 years of life left. More if I clean the moss. Confirmed the room was installed crappy, with staples and 3 tab, but has reminded us we have had some wild winds and it has not failed and is probably fine."
AskReddit,ff5alvv,t3_erq426,1579585341.0,"Not a psychiatrist but counselor, I was 17 and suicidal. I was raped when I was 9 and had just told my mom that is why I tried to kill myself and my mom decided I should see someone I knew, so I would be comfortable with them. 
The counselor was a neighbor and also knew my abuser. He brushed off my attack and told me it was “normal exploration”. I told him it was against my will and I told him to stop, and he said “it’s okay, it’s normal”. I tried to tell him the 15 year old boy held a hatchet to my neck and forced me to give him oral sex while his 6 year old sister encouraged me saying it tasted like lemon meringue pie. But he interrupted me and kept acting like it was no big deal. I told him I was no longer suicidal so I could leave and he got all cocky for “curing” me and I never spoke with another therapist about it again until 23 years later."
AskReddit,ff59sm7,t1_fdj8m2t,1579584569.0,"Not husband and wife, but my husband’s 4th great grandfather is named Nimrod McCracken and Grandpa Nim’s sister is Lettice. Grandpa Nim also had a daughter named Calender and sons named Rufin Jasper, and Berry."
myfavoritemurder,felv4eu,t1_felqebo,1579231695.0,"Yup, a few times his name slipped my mind and I was like “honey” or “babe” while I was trying to remember what it was. We are both horrible with names so he would have laughed it off if I had admitted it, but we hadn’t even farted in front of each other yet, so no way I was admitting that. 

But there were definitely an occasional “oh shit” moment or two where I was drawing a blank. In retrospect I am a complete idiot that I didn’t just associate his name with the famous person who has the same name."
myfavoritemurder,felefg4,t3_epm3f7,1579220238.0,"I met my husband at a party at his apartment (these were the days of dial up BBSes, no Tinder). He said ""it's late, do you want to stay the night?"" and I said ""sure"" never left. I didn't even know his last name, and forgot his first name several times in the first month of living together. 23 years later, he still can't get rid of me. ;)"
adhdwomen,feet28q,t1_fee9s4c,1579040604.0,"I return mine at the UPS store. They send me a code and I take the item and the return code and UPS gives me a receipt and boxes the item for return. Amazon issues a refund usually within minutes of UPS generating the return receipt. It's not even an official UPS, just one who contracts with UPS/USPS/FedEx."
aww,feertig,t1_feenogp,1579039848.0,"No problem, I don't mind sorting out. It's two generations of people so I could have been more clear. My mom had two daughters when my mom and dad married, they then had me (I am a woman). So my dad was a stepdad to my (half) sisters but always treated us the same, we were his 3 little girls.

Fast forward until I am an adult. I marry my husband knowing he could possibly have a child as his girlfriend before me wound up pregnant, but she was cheating on him and told him the child wasn't his.

My husband and I have a son (this was not mentioned in the story above). Through a series of circumstances my husband and I visit my husband's family in another state and my husband's grandma has a picture of a child who looks just like the child I have with my husband. My husband and I decide we should track down his ex, because the child looks a lot like my husband.

We find the ex (BM-biomom) and meet up with her and her son (DS) who is 2 1/2. We pledge to stay in contact and send her child support and add DS to my husband's military benefits so he can have health insurance. After about a year, BM decides she wants DS to come live with my husband and I, we are a stable two parent household and she wants DS to know his little bother.

My dad, who has experience as a stepdad takes me aside and threatens that I better not treat the boys any different, if I accept the roll of stepmom he wants me to act like mom, and not stepmom. I take it to heart, but know I am a stranger to DS, and let him decide what name he wants to use for me, through the years it evolves starting with calling me by first name, to mom. He calls BM by her first name.

BM remarried and started a new family. She decided it was a financial burden to raise 2 kids and pay child support and asks me to adopt DS. I do, and now I am his legal mom.

DS grew up, he's 23 now. He is my oldest son, his brothers are 22, 14, and 9, and his sister is 11. (He also has 2 siblings from BM, but he's only met them once.) When he was an adult I spoke with BM and we were civil and appreciative of each other's sacrifice. She appreciated me for raising a child who was not biologically my own. I appreciated her for seeing DS had a better chance at a normal life and making a huge sacrifice of letting another woman step into the roll of mom. I made sure my DS always knew he was loved by both me, and BM, I never wanted him to feel abandon because he was ""given away by mommy"" because that was never the case.

Hopefully that makes more sense. And I hope you feel better soon!"
aww,feenddv,t1_feen85b,1579037255.0,Which part is confusing? Maybe I can clarify for you.
aww,feegva0,t1_feectfg,1579033493.0,"My dad was a stepfather (though he never called them or himself that) to my sisters; best advice he gave me as we were changing custody was “if I ever hear you call yourself or that boy ‘step’ anything; I’ll smack the shit out of you“. Which translates into “if you take this on, go all in. He is now your son to love and treat as your own”. I let my son use whatever name for me and his mom, at first I was my first name, then I was mom, and she was my other mom, or mommy her first name, then her first name. I always told him he was so lucky because he gets to be loved by even more mommies than anyone else. She eventually married a good guy, had other kids with him, and after years of me offering, took me up on my offer to adopt him. She has thanked me for loving him and raising him well. I have thanked her for loving him so much she was able to give up half her heart to give him a stable life, and for trusting me to love and nurture our son. He’s 23 now and just a fantastic kid.

Your kid is so lucky to have two dads who love him."

I am blown away at the casting and the makeup and and the dedication from the actors. If you close your eyes and listen it is hard to tell who is who. They seriously nailed their roles.

tifu,fctn2ir,t3_eingyf,1577949665.0,"First break ups are hard, I had my note written and a gun in my mouth. I was 17 and knew for sure it would never get better. He was the fucking love of my life. We were together 18 months and engaged and after he made some stupid mistakes with drugs, and I treated him like a child, he started ghosting me and I cut it off. The only thing that stopped me is the belief in he .22 wouldn’t kill me and just leave me in agony, and that my dad would be pissed because he just got the gun back from the cops after the police had it for 20 years after a friend used it to kill his mother in law. 

My parents found my note, I came clean about the depression I was hiding, the rape I had never told them about that I had stopped taking my Prozac. 

I wish I could say it all got better from there, but it got worse, a lot worse. I was reckless and made stupid decisions with my safety. I ran away from home and lived with bad bad people. But I realized I didn’t want to kill myself. Nor did I want to die. I started changing my situation slowly, and met a man who would change my life. He saw just how bad my living situation was and slowly I started to believe I was worth loving. We’ve been married now for almost 23 years. 

My 14 year old deals with anxiety and depression like I did. I feel how scary it is as a parent to watch your kid struggle. A big part of my low self esteem was undiagnosed ADHD leading me to believe I was wasting my potential and lazy. I have him seeing a counselor and he is on medications for his own adhd and depression/anxiety and hope he never feels like the world would be better without him. 

A little over a year ago my friend’s husband hung himself in their garage. Watching her and his children grieve has showed me I have no clue what real pain is. The pain she feels from losing her husband is so big, like a bottomless pit of despair. Add to that he was a combat veteran with PTSD and discouraged from getting help. Add to that the stupid comments asking her “what she did to him to make him want to do that”, and that her ex boyfriend also commit suicide years before. 

I am so glad you met that man. He was meant to find you, alive. Sounds like he needed you as well. I bet he would love if you started writing him letters or visiting him. 

It will get better, it will get worse, and it will get mediocre. That is life. Even on my very worst day, I no longer want to kill myself now, but if you still do, please get help. Depression and suicidal ideation isn’t your fault. You deserve better and should feel no shame in admitting you need help. If they turn you away, or aren’t a good fit, please don’t give up. Find someone else. I hope you find a way to love yourself, it makes a huge difference."
