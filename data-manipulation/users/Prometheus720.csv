Besides, outside of the testing environment, these kids can create their own accommodations. They can develop their own methods of getting by. I know a professor who has dyslexia. He tries to listen to audiobooks and run things through speech to text sometimes. Power to him. But you can't do that in the testing environment."

Not at lunch or recess (if young enough). If they forget it after school, no phone at all for the rest of the day, maybe the weekend!

If you are really concerned about privacy with the database, then I would recommend also using a key file (whose hash works like a password) outside of your sync system.

education,ffjywmt,t3_etuepe,1580010776.0,"There is no magical thing called ""technology."" There are as many or more varied tasks which can be accomplished with the various types of computer as there are tasks within mathematics.

I attended a panel discussion as part of a local conference about this topic; we had a local HS principal, ed psych professor who studies ed tech, curriculum developer, and some other person who had no business being there.

They brought up several issues. I'll list a few.

1. Use of technology is very different between the social classes. I just looked at census data for my city; not even 75% of the households there have broadband, and only about 75% have what we think of as ""computers,"" meaning laptops or desktops. The students who have access to hardware and a connection have a totally different experience than the other students who need to use public computers or phones to access things.

2. Chromebooks, iPads, and other ""educational devices"" are not desktop computers. Students are learning some skills which have cross applications (such as typing and the use of internet browsers), but they are often not learning how to use key features of desktop operating systems such as Windows, Linux, or Macintosh.

3. Students are using an entirely different tech ecosystem at school than is used in the workplace. They are often using Google Classroom in concert with Google Docs, Drive, Sheets, Slides, and so on. They are often using other apps on a Chromebook which root them more firmly within the Google ecosystem. This is not what they are going to experience at work--they don't have skill in using Microsoft Office, the Adobe Creative Suite, or many other common workplace applications.

4. This isn't a new problem, but most students are not being exposed to email (or email etiquette) at all until high school. Sometimes this includes high school. IMO, many students actually develop these types of skills in community college. I don't have data to back that up but it was certainly my personal experience, and the speakers talked about the issue as well.

5. There are achievement gaps between students which are exacerbated by technology. Using computers makes it *harder* for disenfranchised groups and students from less educated backgrounds to ""catch up"" to their peers. This is best corrected by using 1 to 1 strategies and including internet connectivity along with the hardware. The principal's school has a pool of wifi hotspots that they loan out to students who need them, alongside the chromebooks or laptops or whatever. That way, if a student needs to use the internet to research something for a paper, they can actually do that. Internet access is less common than computers themselves. It is the limiting factor, not the hardware.

*In my opinion,* the most critical issue we face is the proliferation of data. We are looking at an exponential increase in the amount of information available to kids in the future. Understanding how to navigate that sea of information to find what is actually useful, trustworthy, and so on is key. That's more important to me because if students know how to do that, they will have little trouble learning how to use computers and software applications throughout their lives."
politics,ffior0b,t1_ffhgrc3,1579978964.0,"> Their minds have been twisted to see threats at every door.

I want to push back on this for a second. In my opinion, leftists (or liberals if you are American) see just as many threats. We also try to motivate each other with fear or concern.

What makes our approach to fear different is that many of the things we fear are not even human. They are not *other people.* They are existential threats like climate change and global health. IMO this kind of fear can still be used to manipulate people, but it is much more cooperative rather than antagonistic. It's less hateful.

That isn't always the case. There is plenty of fear based around other people. Jeff Bezos, Trump, Sean Hannity, Mitch McConnell, and so on are all hated and treated as objects of fear. There is a very strong vein of ""fear of the other"" in American liberal/leftist culture too.

But I think the key difference is that at least not everything is based in fear and disgust of other people. At least some of the things we worry about are things we can work together on *as an entire species.* At least some of the things are problems we can share.

It's like being in a relationship with someone who always thinks it is your fault, versus someone who often blames you at first but then eventually apologizes, blames a situation, and seeks to work with you to fix the situation.

The second person is still pretty immature. But at least they are a little more mature than the first person."
science,ffinl9r,t1_ffg9ypv,1579978178.0,"The problem is that we now need you to define the lecture method.

Lecture is the most popular style, and as such there are countless ways it has been done. Some of them are completely trash, and that should be obvious. Others are quite good.

I would say it this way. At least for university students, lecture is like rice. You can eat a lot of rice and still be healthy. But if all you eat is rice, you're in trouble. You need some protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals.

If you never take a moment out of ""I talk about this PowerPoint and you take notes"" to give a demonstration, tell a story, do a little partnerwork or interaction, clicker questions, or *something,* you are just eating plain white rice the entire period. That isn't healthy learning.

EDIT: I would agree with /u/xPyrez and point out that often, words on the board/PowerPoint compete with what is being said by the lecturer. It is good to try and mainly use images, graphs, or nonverbal information. If you need something to read verbatim, you're not a good lecturer; if you need some notes, use the speaker notes section. If information is written in the PowerPoint, it should be a small number of short pieces of information. No more than one line per bullet. The only exceptions are tables, jokes, pithy quotes, and key questions or statements by the speaker."
science,ffin6q6,t1_ffgchot,1579977898.0,"I mean that a certain part of the brain has to act as the language processing center. In humans who speak verbally, that is one location. In humans who cannot or do not speak but instead use sign language, things shift around to accommodate the use of hands and gestures (and probably lipreading) as language.

However, that works best with children who have extremely plastic brains. Adult brains cannot reorganize themselves in the same way.

But does that mean that adults cannot become fluent in ALS? Absolutely not. Adult brains are still plastic and can still understand sign language and use it fluently. It takes longer and different neural routes will be used, but the key takeaway is that *it works.*

A true critical period means that once that period is over, you can't make it up. If you don't develop eyes in utero, you are never going to grow eyes one day with enough work and support. You just will not have eyes, ever.

That is not how language works. If you even have to say ""I have my doubts,"" that probably makes it a sensitive period. If it is possible, it's not a critical period."
science,ffg28se,t1_fffxd54,1579896884.0,"The argument originally was that some people are more sensitive to learning in one format or another. You could reliably label people as ""kinesthetic learners"" or ""visual learners"" and that would remain accurate over the long term.

What we've found is actually that you can't really do a good job labeling people that way, and there isn't so much a sensitivity to one sense or the other. Instead, using multiple methods *at the same time* is the best way for *all learners.*

That means that everyone is like you, to some extent. *Everyone* learns better if you talk about something and also show a visual example.

Some students do have a reduced ability to learn with certain formats--they may have hearing, visual, or orthopedic disabilities which reduce their ability to participate in certain types of presentations and activities.

Rather than trying to figure out how each student learns best, dividing them into groups, or intentionally trying to target ONE style to someone we believe will understand it better, it is best to use differentiated instruction that always contains more than one way of presenting information.

It is not because of a sensitivity; it is because this works like repetition. It gives multiple routes in the brain to access the information.

Does that make sense?"
science,ffg1d03,t1_fffw80r,1579896335.0,"If it's a critical period, that means that it is impossible or almost impossible after that period has passed.

There are critical periods in embryonic development during which certain chemicals can cause certain defects, but after those periods the effect is either not present or different.

Physical development has critical periods like that. If eyes don't develop in utero, they will never develop. There is no way to catch up.

The term *sensitive period* implies that there is special sensitivity during that period, but that it is possible for that development occur later. Language is not a critical period.

If language was a critical period, fluency in sign language and fingerspelling would be impossible for people who develop deafness as teens or adults. You'd have to learn it as a child to be able to use it.

A sensitive period can have a hard and obvious dividing line, say at puberty. After puberty, it can be sure that the period is over and that things are much harder. But it isn't a critical period unless it is impossible for most people to develop after the period ends.

That's why the term ""critical period"" is going by the wayside. It implies that there is no hope after the period is over. That's really not the case."
science,fffzk8y,t1_fffx6vl,1579895233.0,"2--Learning styles is not about engagement. The claim with learning styles is that students learn more if information is presented in different sensory formats. You learn more with your eyes than your ears, or vice versa. I think your teachers boring you is a totally separate issue.

As for the veracity of this concept, it's a little off. There isn't really any evidence that individual students learn way better this way or that way. The current evidence is more that ""All students learn better if information is presented in multiple formats, and some of your students might have sensory disabilities so it's best to use differentiated presentation styles anyway.""

GoldandBlack,fesbwnb,t1_feps873,1579363660.0,"Ok, here is an actual argument.

It is as unlikely that Bernie would institute gulags as it was that Trump would institute concentration camps. People love to call people the most extreme things possible during election years.

For the record, fuck these individual people who are on tape here. Gulags are so obviously unacceptable that I feel like an idiot even saying that. American prisons are certainly not worse than gulags, but in fairness they are really bad and are unacceptable as well.

Violent revolutions do not work, because they destroy peaceful means of transferring power. Then you have several cycles of strongmen seizing and reseizing power. It only works if you are being beset by a foreign power and you don't care about strongmen, you just want someone who is from your culture to be in charge. The American Revolution and Haitian Revolution are two very good examples of that.

Project Veritas is known for spinning things however they like. They are not an unbiased group. They target one side of the political spectrum, and they clearly have a mandate to do whatever they can to smear that side. If this research was performed by a group which was known for exposing all types of candidates, I would take it much more seriously.

These individuals have very little to do with Bernie and his personal beliefs. They likely have never even met him.

At the end they mention anonymous tips. You can't show who sent them, obviously, but you can and should show the content of the tips rather than paraphrasing.

Again, there is no oversight. This isn't real journalism. If you were to do this at a paper, there would be a lot of thought about how and what to publish. In this case, the entire thing is an attempt to skew the election away from one individual who they knew they didn't like from the get-go.

It is pure partisan misdirection. Finally, I want to emphasize that Trump is not a libertarian of any sort, and that anyone who'd pick him over Bernie is not focused on libertarianism; they are focused on left-right differences. Maybe that's ok with you, but let's all at least be honest about it."

In reality, many bacteria are not culturable, even with modern techniques. Not everything in the body grows in a dish.

There are other ways that we can find out if there is something growing in a liquid, though. We can use flow cytometry. That is basically pushing the liquid through a tube so thin that cells must pass in a single-file line. They can be counted in that line with special light, electricity, etc.

We can also look at it in a microscope, and so on.

People have gotten different results on this topic across many years of study, and that's because there are multiple ways to go about it, and multiple ways to goof it up.
