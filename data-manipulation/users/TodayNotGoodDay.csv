Do narcissists have conscience of self preservation ?     

Let me put myself in his mind.    

I, Trump have a fear (it is said) of germs , these little bastards that you don't see but have to repel by a forceful flushing of golden toilets.    
I bully those I consider as weak and whom I consider too feeble to respect, those I need to pay to get something. Business as usual.    

I worship the powerful bastards like me Trump (when doped up) who have what I want. These guys are in power and seem to know how to keep it.     
These guys have a reputation of assassinating their personal enemies, they are unattainable.    
To pretend that I (Trump) am too I order a drone strike.  A drone strike doesn't seem to be personal , it is a fantasy of power , he may have watched that on TV, like Obama with the other one ...  what s his name ?       
 
But I know I am not like them when I wake up in the night and read tweets and hateful news.     

Trump has killed a powerful man revered by fanatics he suddenly realized are probably more powerful than he thought ... or maybe he forgot that day who Iranians were.    

But Trump (the bone spur warrior) didn't want the Bolton war by fear of personal retaliations, I think. He may have pushed the Iranian to be nice to Bolton, the possible witness.      
     
At the time I wrote this message there was a debate about not publishing the cost of Golf Courses trips. I have the feeling that this is because they have tripled due to new risk assessments , because publishing them is giving data on Trump location (which is a reasonable precaution by the way) .

Iran since 1951 had increasing oscillations between privatization or nationalization of exploitation of oil resources with an increased violence after each coup.     
 
Basically the English (NIOC) wanted to keep control over oil. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (Shah) along with Ali Razmara (PM assassinated ) was for them.     
 
But Mossadegh (National Front: liberal democracy and social democracy) with some support from others including communist or Shiite Islamists decided to nationalize.     

The coup by CIA and English lead to the return of the Shah and violent oppression during Cold War with good business with oil at the detriment of population.      

Then came Khomeini and its condemnation of the National Front at the benefit of a theocracy.

But when you directly kill a general by direct order, the drone , the satellite, the chain of command are suddenly gone. You ordered that.  And you have been the one that pulled the trigger.  I imagine Trump in this situation, right now.     

Some advisers may have reminded him of Salman Rushdie, on how unfairly he was targeted by a fatwa for mere words in a book.   And Trump may have realized that he has killed the second  most powerful guy in Iran. How much he f.ck.d up.

- a North part controlled by a the Kurds (If founded by Russian for pipeline and influence? ) but with tension with Turkey  and lack of troop support they have small  chances ... they want to survive and they will negotiate. Can Turkey go there ? Don't think so. The recent Turkey-Russia relations is also strange.           

- a West part controlled by some ISIS guys (if founded by Saudies and US (as always?) but secretly ... as always ? )         

- a East part controlled by Iran   (with support from Russia or China)   with military action against Saudi (maybe US coalition)             

Saudi will be wiped if not supported by the US with troops because we have seen the Saudi have Gold but their army suck ... with the last terrorist attack by an Saudi guy I feel bad for this scenario.             

If war the US will try to go fast but won't get much support internally, from Europe , ... the US hardly control Iraq nowadays what about after they hypothetically get Iran ? The Iran internal opposition cannot gain strength and control during of war.                 

Anyway this war would kill many innocent people and all this for a pathetic and sociopath(etic) idea that war could save a second turn to Trump and avoid impeachment."

I must however confess (not religiously) to you that I cannot remove from me all the remnants of million years of evolution, the memes and symbolic thoughts processes that are the building blocks of our mind.  I personally think that I can better fight religious zealots,  the evangelical money launderers when I can see the symbolic, the ritualistic aspects that shape my mind and the mind of their followers.     

First step for me defend political, ethical, judiciary secularism at all cost.
