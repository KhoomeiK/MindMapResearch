well, thats the beauty of a permissionless decentralized system, and why its so important that monero fought the hard fight of ASIC resistance.

There have been a couple of reports on reddit of enthusiastic solo miners using just their home PC that found a block. Who knows how many are finding solo blocks but simply aren't announcing it on the reddits.

Technically, yes. Wownero doesn't have inflation. But it still has fees. 

> IMHO Fees and Inflation are the root of evil concerning money, 

Inflation as we know it could be considered evil. Inflation as monero has implemented it is actually known as disinflation. To the googles you go!

Furthermore, the world has never seen a currency that has a fixed inflation. Every other attempt at implementing inflation has to rely on ""smart people"" to move the inflation needle here and there. With monero, its 0.3 XMR per block minute forever. We'll have the same disinflation in 10 years that we'll have in 100 years. You can plan around that.
