depression,fcor8ua,t1_fcoqyak,1577839402.0,No problem! Yes! You never know what to expect! I really hope your dreams come true this year :)
depression,fcoqnpp,t1_fcopjgl,1577838976.0,"Oh, I see. I totally understand what you mean as I’ve experienced similar feelings and situations before (my birthday this year for example). I know it’s difficult to feel grateful in a situation like that, and I honestly don’t know what you can do to feel better :/

I just try to remind myself that this whole event/celebration will be over, and hopefully I can spend more quality time with people that I actually enjoy hanging out with on a «normal» day. Maybe next year you’ll have better luck! Maybe closer or new friends that you can spend time with on these special occasions :) But for now; relax, eat your favorite food and watch your favorite series/movie. You will feel less shittier then, I hope."

But again, if he’s an actual douchebag, then yeah, I would probably feel kind of disappointed."
