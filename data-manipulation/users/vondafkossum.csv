Even the games I start with the intention of being an evil military power rarely end up with a Military victory for me."

todayilearned,ff7eagu,t1_ff6mzv6,1579647555.0,"Those are, generally speaking, people who are adults whose body chemistry has shifted post-puberty. And not everyone who does that work *can* positively adapt to that schedule. Some people just aren’t or can’t be wired to shift their natural rhythms that way. Anecdotally, I’m an adult who, given no work time restrictions, would prefer to go to bed at 4am and wake up at 10am. Unfortunately, I’ve chosen a profession that requires me to be up at 525am most of the year. My entire professional career has been one in which I’ve operated on a sleep deficit, and it has caused related health issues. Ideally I’d just go to bed earlier, which in theory sounds good/easy, but I literally cannot sleep before 11pm at the earliest unless I use medication—which has its own problems. 

Teens have a very unique body chemistry that pushes them into a different sleep cycle. It’s also why they need more sleep (in fact, the most sleep they’ll ever need in their life span development)."
todayilearned,ff5ozi4,t1_ff56eix,1579604022.0,"I mean, sure, but none of that changes biology. You were supposed to learn about these things during the class(es) you took on human development as part of your teacher training."
todayilearned,ff52plr,t1_ff4ycsh,1579578608.0,"Hold up, you teach teenagers and don’t already know that teenagers’ sleep schedules naturally shift toward staying up later and still needing additional sleep (9-10 hrs)? No matter what time school starts, teenagers will, generally speaking, prefer to stay up “late.” It’s how their bodies are currently wired. 

It *is* a piece with an agenda. It’s saying what we’ve known for years: high school should start later to be more developmentally in line with the people who attend high school."

The question asking me who I’d rather read a review by is strange because of the wording of the options. What is the difference between a “regular person” and an “expert” in this context? Because I don’t read reviews, but was required to answer that question, I really wasn’t sure which response to select. Maybe I’m over thinking it. 

Anyway, good luck with your project. I hope you get a lot of responses."

What I’m telling you is that that practice isn’t normal, and, honestly, having that many coverage requests in so short amount of time is alarming. Of course you’re free to do whatever you’d like, but you’re being conned into doing something for free that should be paid for."
AskReddit,fdfpuii,t1_fdfnf87,1578367332.0,"If you’re new to teaching, let me tell you you’re being taken advantage of. Good schools with good admin don’t force staff to cover each other (I’ve had to cover maybe once in the last two years?) and not pay you. There’s no way I would give up my planning period to even do roll and hand out a worksheet unless I were being paid. Comp time is a cheap placating tool like free jeans days and a candy bar in your box during a holiday.

Edit: I didn’t go to school for math, but if you’ve covered 20 classes (in a single semester???), at my school you would have been paid $700."
AskReddit,fdflavn,t1_fdek2ez,1578364346.0,"Yikes. 1: y’all should have enough sub coverage that you don’t have to fill in at all unless there is a legitimate emergency—much less “a lot,” and 2: you should be getting *paid* for your labor and sacrificing your planning instead of comp time (which reduces your planning/work time even more)."

Maybe I’m just too much of a hedonist, but I don’t see the point of putting effort into something like that. I could probably make it through one or two meals like that, but after that I’d probably rather just go to bed. I’m always fascinated by rice/beans and bare bones food suggestions.

Then you have the entire class acting like absolute assholes in the time it takes for someone to show up because now you’ve created a power struggle. It’s a huge, huge disruption to class—and it could happen multiple times a class period, depending on the group of students. Some kids just do not give a fuck about ruining the educational opportunities for everyone else in the room. 

I give kids the option to surrender it to my drawer for the period or take the referral. Most of them choose the drawer (because there’s no paper trail), but sometimes they just take the referral.

flicks,fcaih7x,t3_egv062,1577569808.0,"I’m a recovering drug addict. I was talking with a friend about this movie, and I have to say, it’s one of the best films I’ve ever seen that’s about addiction—and maintains the mania and chaos of addiction throughout its entire runtime—that’s not about drug addiction. We don’t get a lot of addict films/stories that aren’t about drugs, and I wish we did: they’re really interesting character studies that (usually) don’t rely desperately on overplayed archetypes. 

You keep thinking, he can’t possibly keep making these decisions (and the friend I went to see it with actually left the cinema because she said it was ridiculously over the top), but *of course* he does. Of course. Of course he ruins every relationship he has, of course he burns every bridge, of course he’s manipulative and narcissistic. Of course he’s also charismatic enough to maintain an illusion until he can’t. His wife laughing in his face is my absolute favorite part of the film; she *knows* him, and she won’t fall into his nonsense again whereas everyone else in his orbit only sees bits and pieces. 

I enjoyed the mania of it. I enjoyed the array of the characters. I enjoyed the anxiety of every scene. I’ve read a few reviews where people legit couldn’t handle the level and/or volume of the overlapping dialogue and that’s absolutely fair. 

And then, I enjoyed the ending of the film. There’s no high higher than the one he achieved. So the story either becomes a sad tale of spiraling lows of him chasing that high forever, that *win* forever, or it remains a tragedy of a player cut down at the height of the game."
Catswhoyell,fc6u3f4,t3_ege60w,1577489528.0,Jasper is my favorite. I can’t believe he’s STILL there. I’ve been keeping up with him. Hope he gets adopted soon!!!
