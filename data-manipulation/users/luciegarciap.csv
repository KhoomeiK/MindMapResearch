getdisciplined,ffapcky,t1_ffa83yd,1579741344.0,"Yessss. Men need to be _interesting_ for women, or anyone for that matter, to be interested in them."
getdisciplined,ff91im3,t3_es7su4,1579702505.0,"I know this might sound harsh, but you need to get away from your parents and become actually independent from your family. Move out of your sister's condo, you said you earn good money, right? Find some place else. Still being under your family's wig, eating with your parents every day at 31 is not healthy. They'll always see you _and treat you_ as a little boy, so you'll always feel like one when you're around them.

So, find an actual place of your own. Even the fact that the condo you live in is your sister's, is creating a dependency on your family. I'd highly recommend getting a roommate. Ask at your workplace if someone is interested in a roommate. I understand that it sucks to be alone and so you restore to go to your parents'. My roommate recently moved out and now all I do is order take out and watch TV because cooking for one feels too depressing. So, you need to get yourself a place independent from your family and find a roommate to share it with.

Second, find stuff that interests you and go do them, join clubs that do those stuff. Don't know what you like? Great. You have 11 months ahead of you to try 11 different new things, one each month.

Join a book club, go to art galleries, enroll in a Japanese or Arabic or French or Italian class, get into astronomy and find an observation group near you, find a cinema club and watch independent films, start going to local band concerts, look up free dance classes in your city hall, etc. DO. SOMETHING. Find a hobby. I'm serious, make a list of everything you'd like to try and do each thing for at least one month to test if you actually like them. 

It's great that you're going to the gym now, but otherwise your life consists of work, the internet and eating at your parents. No offense, man, but no wonder the women you go out with get bored.

 People are what they do, and so far you're doing nothing. But if you try new things, not only will you disrupt the routine that has you in that rut, but you'll meet new people in the process and will be able to hang out with them, become friends, go grab dinner with them so you'll stop eating at your parents every day, and maybe one day even start dating someone. And even if you continue to date people outside those groups, you'll be able to tell them what you're doing now:

""So what do you do?“
"" I'm a [job title] what about you?""

_Versus_

""So what do you do?“
“Well, I'm a [job title] but I'm also learning Japanese and I'm into also astrology""
""Wow, that sounds interesting. How do you even read Japanese?“
""It actually has three alphabets, so to speak...""

Well, you get it. Honestly, one of the things I love most about my boyfriend is seeing how passionate he is about the things he likes (f1, stand up comedy, airplanes) and even if I'm not into those things, I'll randomly ask him _what plane is that?_ when one passes above us and him saying _that's a 747_ or _looks like an A320_ always makes me smile. I have no idea what any of it means, but I love that he does and that he cares so much about airplanes he took the time to memorize how they work and what they look like, even from afar. Even when we started dating and he'd do that, it turned me on a little, seeing how smart he was. 

What do _you_ care about, OP? Figure it out, and geek out. It's sexy, trust me. 

On a side note, stop worrying about ""being a virgin"". Most women wouldn't give a flying fuck about that, and tbh most wouldn't be able to tell anyway. What's driving them away is not a ""virgin stench"" that they can smell. It's the fact that, honestly, you sound pretty boring, and way too dependent on your family even though you're financially independent. And at that age, women are looking for someone serious to one day start a family with. They can't do that with you if you're still part of your parents' family. And how can they like you when you barely stand yourself? 

Hope that helps, sorry if I was harsh. You can do this. Get out there, try new stuff! You've got this!"

You'll see this particularly with Ayahuasca, which is only supposed to be taken by religious leaders and spiritually strong people to communicate with the Earth and Gods.

Too many men (women too, but stereotypes lead men to do this more often) focus too much on developing physically and financially and forget about being emotionally healthy too.

Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but when you say you want to be ""more of a man"", I feel like you still have a long way to go, emotions-wise. And that's okay. We're all trying to improve here. 

Just ask yourself, what does ""being a man"" mean to you? And why does it matter that you become ""more"" of it? Why not aim to just become a _better person_?

It's just something I've been thinking about lately: being _better_ instead of being more. Our society focuses a lot on quantity versus quality, and I'm starting to realize that maybe that's not the way.

Also, remember you're only competing against yourself, be kind and patient with yourself. You can't compare other people's highlight reel with your bloopers reel. Don't get distracted or discouraged by the apparent perfect lives others show on social media. Focus on yourself, and build a life you want to live not just post pictures of.

DigitalMarketing,fdk0s8b,t1_fdk0iml,1578493204.0,"Also, because roles are so divided in agencies, if you work as a copy in an agency, that's it, that's your job. You might brainstorm every now and then with the creatives or the people who do artwork, but you're mostly limited to your job. So you're gonna become pretty good at writing copy, but won't know how to plan a strategy or how to photoshop anything or set up a campaign. Meanwhile, when you're in-house, you usually have to do it all by yourself or with a very small team, so you'll learn abilities in every aspect of the marketing process."
DigitalMarketing,fdk0iml,t1_fdjo0o8,1578493006.0,"Well, here, for example, agencies do a lot of last minute work. Idk if it's the sheer volume of work that needs to be done or just the myth of creative people being lazy, and waiting for inspiration, but things won't advance much until the very last minute possible before the deadline.

Also, and as a consequence of this, people in agencies usually stay after the workday is over, sometimes well into the night. And this is a thing they do regularly, so they kind of expect other people to also be working at 11pm, and will email or text you asking for things they need to continue working but for some reason couldn't ask for at 3pm.

Besides being annoying, if you're a boss and you pay extra for after-hours, the night-time ""creativity"" of people who are used to work like this is going to cost you a fortune. They're also (because of the all nighters and the after-hours) used to eating at the office, so their desks might or might not be similar to Jake Peralta's."
DigitalMarketing,fdjha6j,t1_fdiwcn1,1578470762.0,"Well, idk if this is a thing anywhere else, but in my country agencies have a reputation. And it's not precisely a good one. Agency workers apparently ""pick up"" bad agency habits that not every business owner is willing to put up with.

So, at least in my country, it's really difficult to transition from working in an ad/marketing agency to in-house. You can do the other way around pretty easily, though. But if you take an internship or job at an agency early in your career, particularly one of the big, traditional ones, you're basically sentenced to keep on working on agencies for the rest of your life.

Again, idk if this is everywhere, but in my experience and to my knowledge, if you want work mobility and being able to explore different paths, don't get an internship at an agency as your first ""job"". Gather other types of experience first."

The thing with the bag is, I use a bus to get to work everyday. So I'd have to carry it all day and sometimes in a peak hour stuffed bus, on top of also carrying my laptop. I'm thinking about maybe leaving my stuff in a password-locked locker at the gym? But idk if that's possible."

DecidingToBeBetter,fcy8slu,t3_ejj0e7,1578076454.0,"Reconnect with yourself, and get busy. Heartbreak sucks but it thrives in your mind being bored so it goes back to thinking about him. So the best thing you can do right now (at least from my experience) is to distract yourself. But truly distract yourself, don't spend all day looking at screens. And don't bury yourself into work either, that's only going to make you more miserable. 

Go outside. Meet some friends. Go to a museum, a concert, a hike, a walking tour of your city, go watch live theater or a type of movie you'd never watch, go see a stand-up comedian, buy a 300-piece puzzle, listen to podcasts and paint. DO. STUFF. Put yourself in situations where you can't look at your phone to stalk on him: a theater, a hike, a concert hall, if you're painting or knitting, your hands are busy and you can't check your phone either. Make your mind busy and cultivate yourself but also make your body tired, so when you get home you crash into bed without dwelling as much.

Of course, you'll think of him every now and then, but when you keep yourself busy you're doing two things: 1) distracting your mind so it's harder for it to default to thinking about him and 2) proving to yourself that there's more to life than him, and that you'll be okay. You got this, boo."

LateStageCapitalism,fct1uau,t1_fcsq0nn,1577930690.0,"It's bad journalistic practice to not thoroughly research a subject. Accepting the information they give you in the interview without researching their past, their connections, etc. Even not researching them before doing the interview is already malpractice, you're coming to an interview unprepared. So then leaving out of the piece crucial information that contributed to their success, is irresponsible to say the least.

Also, it's not journalists fault the rich are rich lol no one is saying that, where did you get that from? But it *is* their fault if they're irresponsible about the pieces they publish. And it *is* their responsibility to the public to make a thorough research before publishing ""inspirational self-made entrepreneur"" pieces about people who literally had everything handed to them just because of their last name."
