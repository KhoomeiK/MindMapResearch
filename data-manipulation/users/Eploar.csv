They basically killed Azshara, one of the better villains in the game and now will kill an Old God all in the span of a single patch. They both deserved their own expansion. I'm quite sad they didn't take the void and light battle route as it was being foreshadowed for so, so long. It feels like they made Sylvanas into a baddie and then decided they need to give her some other way out which is neither victory nor death, hence the escape into the Shadowlands. I'll bet you they are gonna do some form of redemption story for all the shit she pulled in BfA and Nelves are gonna be stomped yet again.

> It fucks up their psychology and prevents critical thinking from growing

This is a plain idiotic statement, if anything, religion forces critical thinking to grow in healthy environment. Considering that religion is completely abstract, ideas that it poses a challenge to the mind to understand the boundaries of logic. Humans are more than critical thinking machines, we have emotions which is a part where religion exists. The problem arises when zealots try to push religion to explain the logical concepts using faith and you hear the stories of said zealots on Reddit all the time but here's the problem - Reddit is filtered from real world. Most Christians are some of the kindest and acceptable people I had the honor of meeting. Just because there are a couple of rotten eggs that doesn't mean the whole basket is bad. Attending a Sunday church won't damage children in the slightest, it will give them a new experience they can rely on when later deciding whether to pursue religious ideologies or not."

masseffect,fe8w4xf,t3_eo0gev,1578931690.0,"One of the most thought provoking storylines I've played in the game, hard contender for the first place against Citadel DLC. I've played paragon, renegade, paragade and renegon and every single time, whatever decision I chose, it left me thinking a good while before and after I made my choice. First time I actually went back and forth between saves wondering what the best choice is. This was before I met Legion and I remember thinking two things:

1.  We need to eliminate Geth and David is our best shot at it. Reapers are coming, we have no time to feelings.
2. There are literal tubes coming out of his body. He is literally being forced to fuse with Geth consciousness. This man is experiencing torture on an unimaginable scale. This is the exact kind of vile crap that Cerberus has been doing the entire ME1. 

In time I made both choices. I do regret what Bioware did with Cerberus storyline, by making them an enemy. They were always about end before means but whatever immoral choice they made, it was towards the greater good. To find those recordings of TIM saying how he manipulated Shepard when one of the major points of ME2 was that TIM went great lengths to *not control* Shepard's actions was disappointing."

Those who are in jail because of false accusations won't be looked at twice unless the accuser comes forward. Them proving their innocence is next to impossible otherwise. On the other hand, coming out as a rape victim is hard enough as it is without the possibility of being called a liar and jailed for it. Jailing fake rape accusers causes a lot more harm than good. Rape accusations are too problematic as they are already, these suggestions makes it all the worse. I am repeating, I am not defending fake rape accusation. I am saying the way you approach it is wrong - harsher sentences isn't the way. How we treat accuser and accused after the allegation is placed is what really needs to change."

Such an outcome is the worst case scenario for a rape victim.

This is the necessary evil and I honestly don't understand how people don't get this. Would you sincerely rather see more of the accused rot in jail for a few select that have been caught in a lie to receive a harsh sentence? What we need to do instead is to raise awareness about rape itself, so that neither the act of rape nor fake rape accusations are perpetrated and to not jump at the first ball if the accusation does happen.
