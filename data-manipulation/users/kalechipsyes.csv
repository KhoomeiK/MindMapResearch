Kids are dumb. Especially teens. It’s easy to forget what it feels like to be young.

When my beta blocker dose was a bit higher than it needed to be, and I was taking it too close to certain supplements and without enough food, it gave me G.I. troubles, which can feel vaguely similar to high heartrate symptoms.

Adjusting for these issues and chewing some ginger helped.

Our body only really has a few broad categories of “feelings” and it can get difficult to differentiate. Consider the above, and talk to your doctor. I ended up losing like 15 pounds within a couple of weeks one time because my dr. upped my beta blocker, just due to this sort of issue. Not fun. Making the above changes really helped me - particularly, taking my magnesium supplement at night, after the beta blocker has worn off."

boston,ff9b8ju,t3_es4wsf,1579709012.0,"As others were saying, talk to people at your school! They may make a special exception to allow you to stay in the dorms! I have heard of other kids with abusive homes or other extenuating situations doing this.

Other people to talk to: 

* an RA - either yours, or someone in another dorm that seems nice, doesn’t matter

* officers in any LGBT+ club on campus. I guarantee you that someone in the club has seen someone else in this situation before.

* anyone at the school’s health center - if they seem unsure what to do, ask them if the school provides mental health counseling, and request a counselor. Again, the counselor’s office will have definitely seen this kind of thing before, and not just from LGBT+ students - this is a classic abusive parent move.

* The president of the school his- or herself - why not go straight to the top, eh?

* Any student counsel officer who seems nice - they should have a pretty good working knowledge of the administration and student clubs, and have a few ideas about who to talk to. Plus, the ly likely got into this kind of roll because they enjoy finding solutions, and are good at organizing and convincing people - they can be a very helpful friend to have.

* If you can find the administrator in charge of housing or student life, visit their office - they might even have helpful pamphlets right outside their office door!

* Any of your professors or TAs who seems nice

* If there is a “women and gender studies” major available at your school, find the office of the dean or chair of that department online, and shoot them an email - or, if you are already looking up classes for next semester, find any course re: LGBT+ topics in that major, and email one of those professors or stop by their office during office hours

* Anyone working at the bursor’s office - tell them your situation and ask them a) what this means in terms of your eligibility for financial aid (you are pretty much an independent student, now, if your parents are not paying for your personal expenses and housing anymore), and b) who they think you should talk to about working out a solution where you might be able to stay in the dorms over the summer while working for the school or something. People in the bursor’s office tend to have seen every friggin’ student situation and know people in every friggin’ department.

* literally anyone with whom you are friends, or at least friendly... just tell as many people that you feel comfortable with as possible about what is going on, and, if they seem like they want to help, ask for someone to walk with you to campus offices or just fucking sit beside you while you make phone calls - it’s normal to feel overwhelmed, and you deserve to feel like people have your back. (Plus, people are less likely to say stupid shit to you if there is a witness, and a second person is often able to keep their head clearer, and advocate harder for you than you might have the energy to advocate for yourself, because this issue is not directly affecting them).

Basically, don’t think just in terms of who can immediately help, but in terms of who can *lead* you to help and who can help you feel more comfortable *asking* for help."

There are things that can make the process easier for you. It’s worth trying to identify them. Don’t give up on yourself - you’re doing your best! You WANT to shower, and to be clean, it’s just extra hard. There may be hurdles that you can remove to make things easier. At some point, there will be a tipping point, and the thing will be easy enough or enticing enough that the amount of internal effort you are putting into trying to force yourself to do the thing will actually result in action!

Big suggestion: grab a piece of paper and a pen, then go to the bathroom, gather up the minimum stuff that you need for the quickest possible shower, and put everything onto a table or something in front of you.

Create a shower routine - not a routine for when you will shower, but a routine for what you will *do* in the shower.

Showering gets documented in our brain as a single task, but it is actually a deceptively complex *series* of tasks. There are a lot of steps where people like us end up “failing”, losing time, and then becoming late and feeling terrible.

Think through your routine, write it down in steps, and then go back to the bathroom and make a space to line up your equipment, in order, and do a few dry runs of the routine.

At some point, when you have the routine memorized, try timing yourself.

Be kind to yourself during this process. It may seem silly, but you may be surprised how long things actually take, how many steps are actually involved, and how many things you forget to do along the way, even with no time pressure and even though you have been doing this your entire life!

Now, see how you can maybe simplify things for yourself.

I recommend:

* **Replacing all flip caps with pump tops.** It’s SO much easier. You don’t have to move the bottle, or fiddle with caps, or even remember to close the thing! If your shampoo does not come in pump-top format, you can easily buy empties online and just decant. (Bonus of decanting is fewer loud packages yelling at you! And you can buy a bottle that feels nice and fits nice in your shower. Or - wash and reuse a hand soap bottle!).

* **Use a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner**, or a 3-in-1 shampoo/conditioner/bodywash, if you have short hair. Herbal Essences sells a WONDERFUL 2-in-1 for their “Hello Hydration!” line (I swear by it, and I have instagrammable mermaid hair - it’s that good), and you can buy it in bulk from Walmart - with a pump top!

* If you usually remove body hair in the shower, **consider getting a buzzer or epilator**, if you can afford either! (“beard trimmers“ can be very cheap, and work perfectly fine for legs or chest or anywhere else). You can just a) buzz down to “skin” instead of even bothering with the razor at all anymore (bonus! fewer ingrown hairs!), b) buzz AND shave so that hair is short and therefore quicker to shave off, or c) epilate instead (it hurts, but it’s weirdly satisfying). Point is: limit time and fuss for yourself *in* the shower wherever possible, by taking activities *outside* the shower!

It may seem silly, but these simple tricks can help a weird amount! Keep your brain open, though, during your dry runs, for inspiration for anything else that you can do to make the process simpler and more pleasant for yourself. It’s OK to get weird with it. Feel like sitting down? Sit down! Notice that you don’t like being trapped behind a shower curtain? Get rid of it, and put a towel on the ground to collect splashes. Who cares? It’s OK if you don’t do everything that society tells you to do - just “turn on water, step in, rinse body, rinse hair, massage in 2-in-1, rinse hair, rinse body again, turn off water, step out of shower and drip everywhere“ constitutes a perfectly acceptable shower. Basic and imperfect is better than not-at-all!"

Things built crudely and for a specific purpose will tend to look similar.

An easy way to put wings onto something is to make two boards, carve them, and then stick one perpendicularly through the other. It’s just a crude bird. Calm down. These wings would not provide lift independently - the object would already need to be moving at speed, and I do not see jets or any other propulsion device represented on that thing. Meaning: no, this is NOT an airplane. It’s a bird (which take off via wing flapping).

At best, it may have been meant to be thrown, and then might glide for a bit. Gliding things of various kinds have been around for quite a while.

Similarly - pyramids are just the easiest way to build something of height. Children automatically make mounds when they encounter sand - it’s the same concept. There is plenty of archeological evidence showing progression from mound-building to pyramid-building. It did not happen all that quickly.

A much more significant engineering marvel of Ancient Egypt was their obelisks. Building something tall and *skinny*, without lateral supports, is way way harder than building a pyramid or mound."

Looky there!

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fesl5xr,t3_eqb4zq,1579366368.0,"Keep water bottles in the freezer.

When you feel this coming on, run and grab a water bottle. (Tell your husband about this plan beforehand, so that he knows what’s going on when you do it).

Holding the frozen water bottle in your hands may help you to stay centered and get through more of the conversation.

Getting through more and more of these conversations, wherein your husband (assumedly) does *not* end up criticizing you, and thus building up more and more positive experiences, may help you to begin to heal and start over-riding the “fight-or-flight” instinct that you have developed.

Edit: most importantly, though... do not criticize yourself for having this instinct. Most likely, it was a necessary protective measure at some point in your early life, for real toxic criticism that you were encountering, and your brain now just needs to learn that it is safe enough to relax this training. Think of it like a dog that, in ancient times, would have protected you from wild animals and spear-wielding cavemen, but is now growling at daffodils, the lawnmower, and the mailman. You can thank your brain for having been protective of you, and you can even find it kind of adorable, after the fact, that it is so confused by modern, non-dangerous life, but still hug it and talk to it kindly while it overreacts. “It’s OK, little brain, you did good - we’re safe now.”"

Hence why it is so oddly smooth, and her clavicles are now basically just hanging from her neck muscles, instead of actually being attached to a skeleton, and her right shoulder is a friggin’ toothpick.

Look at the place where her right boob meets the sea behind it, and you can see where, after the roundest point, the detail suddenly becomes blurry, and it’s almost as if it jumps from sudden bulbousness into a straight line to the sudden scoop of her shoulder. This part was painted on. It doesn’t look right, though, because boobs simply don’t work this way, and neither does the human skeleton.

ADHD,fed77qy,t1_fechfdt,1579002136.0,"I forget the exact procedure, as this was a couple of years ago, but there is one, and the surgeon should tell you in the aftercare notes, or else you can call them and ask. The saline spray is very gentle.

Then, the doctor takes a peek inside of your nose a few days later to clean out any clots that hang around (basically, bleeding is normal, but, since the stitches are inside your nose, the blood dries in odd places, unless it is flushed out before it dries). This procedure is “debridement”. The clots are really annoying to pull out later, though, hence why doing the flushing well on your end is a good idea. If you can manage to keep clots from forming, or limit their quantity and size, then you won’t have to spend weeks going to debridement procedures again and again, with giant clots needing to be pulled out of too-small spaces, like I did! That’s the idea :)"

ADHD,fecerm9,t1_fec9imn,1578972184.0,"Well, that sucks! I hope that the surgery works well for you!

As a veteran of nasal surgery, myself, FYI: get a bunch of cans of saline spray (Arm & Hammer makes a good one) well before the surgery. Check with your doctor beforehand to be sure, but you will probably need to flush your nose out a bunch of times post-op. If you get started right away, this will make debridement MUCH less uncomfortable later on down the line.

My surgeon forgot to mention this to me beforehand, so I only found out the next day, when I finally read through all of the aftercare literature, and then it was still a couple more days before I could drive and pick up the stuff that I needed... so, well, debridement was basically torture. So many clots up in there!"

I love facemasks, but hate doing anything while I am wearing them.

The twitter user is named Crutches and Spice. She has a small picture of herself next to her twitter name.

The tweet reads “I guess this is the type of ableist bullshit you have to deal with when using @DoorDash. #Delivering Abelism”

Below this text is a screenshot of an iMesage exchange. 

In the iMessage exchange, DoorDash driver says, “Hi this is doordash driver (redacted). Will be there in 3 minutes. I’ll meet you in lobby of building 1000.”

Crutches and Spice says, “I’m disabled and need you to come to apartment (redacted).”

DoorDash driver says, “I cannot leave my car in a fire lane.”

Crutches and Spice says, “I need you to come upstairs. I’m in pain and cannot go downstairs at the moment. You should be fine.”

There is a break between messages.

Crutches and Spice again says, “Drop it off at the front desk then.”

DoorDash driver says, “The food is at the front desk.”

Crutches and Spice says, “Maybe if you are unable to accommodate disabled people, you should get another gig.”

There is a break between messages.

Crutches and Spice again says, “I will be reporting this interaction to DoorDash.”

DoorDash driver says, “I can’t park illegally. I just had a 300 dollar ticket.”

This is the end of the iMessage exchange. 

To the right of the screenshot of this tweet and the picture of the iMessage exchange, OP has included an enlarged screenshot of the twitter user’s photo, which shows a fat black woman, apparently sitting astride a red mobility scooter, outside on some sort of paved surface. The woman is facing the camera, wearing large sunglasses and a dark grey T-Shirt that reads “This Body is Worthy”. She is using her right hand to hold her long hair to one side to make the words on her shirt more visible.

(Note from the typer: since the twitter user’s photo was already visible, and doesn’t appear to provide any particularly useful information for interpreting the content of the tweet, the prominent inclusion of an enlarged version of this photo - which OP has displayed at almost twice the size of the tweet screenshot itself - is why some people are accusing OP of targeting this twitter user for ridicule because of her demographics, and not just the content of her tweet)."
facepalm,fe8zwnk,t3_eo3m6g,1578932749.0,"Am disabled and live on an upper floor in a no-elevator building (it’s what I could afford while waiting for disability benefits to come through). When I am ordering food, it is usually because I am doing very poorly, and even just meeting the delivery person at the door would be a serious struggle.

TAKING THAT, AND THE PLIGHT OF THE DELIVERYPERSON, INTO ACCOUNT:

I avoid DoorDash delivery because they don’t usually want to get out of their cars - for good reason. Instead, I’ve got to know the local restaurant scene reasonably well, and I intentionally opt for those whose delivery drivers seem to have an easier time getting away with haphazard street parking (like Domino’s, as they have a marked car).

Even then, I always write a note in the appropriate notes section of the delivery platform, explaining that I am disabled and asking them to buzz my apartment and what floor to bring things to (to save them time and confusion) and thanking them. I figure that this might give some new people a headsup, at least, or at least alert someone along the handling process so that a discussion might be had with the people involved re: what the protocol should be.

I also try to avoid ordering food during high-traffic times, and make sure that I am sitting right next to my apartment door with my door open when the person is set to arrive, then greet them and thank them warmly, and tip reasonably well.

Lastly...if I get a text like the above - which happens - then I explain that while I *can* come down, and am willing to do so if they are willing to wait, it will take some time for me to do so because I am disabled. I figure that, this way, if they’re just saying they can’t come up because they are annoyed or trying to save time, then they can make an appropriate decision, but, otherwise, we can compromise.

The world sucks for both disabled people and delivery drivers, but it is not the fault of either party. Is it fair that I have to go through all of these steps, just to be able to eat? No. No, it’s really really not. But, that’s no reason not to treat service workers like human beings. Most will go to extreme lengths to help out disabled people, in my experience. I try to meet them partway, as best I can.

And, if I’m doing so poorly that there is no way in hell that I could ever make it to the door?

I swallow my pride and call a neighbor or friend or family member for help. Thankfully, I’m not a complete asshole, or someone whose life has forced them to be isolated by no fault of their own, and so I have those."

For the people reading this later, though, so that they can avoid watching and giving this video hits: what is being depicted is abuse and harassment, in a way that light-heartedly pokes at the guy for being so dumb as to fall for the girl’s wiley tricks, vs. actually acknowledging the fear and actual damage that abuse and harassment manufacture.

The caption over the video is “LMAOOOO”. It is shown from a guy’s perspective, as if this is a video that he has made to demonstrate his experience. It starts with the backdrop of text messages as the guy lyrically dance-points to various individual texts. The guy is texting a girl that has broken up with him, and she tells him that he is crazy and to leave her alone. She then relents and tells him that if he delivers her bagels from Montreal within the next 24hours (she lives in NJ), she will reconsider. The video is then mostly taken up with a long montage of the guy driving 8 hours each way to get said bagels, as a particularly schmaltzy cover of “Someone You Loved” plays in the background. As this drags on, you begin to see the likely punchline coming from a mile away. He drops the bagels off at her door and texts her as much. She texts him back a picture of the bag of bagels on a table with two pairs of legs propped next to them, one on either side. She thanks the guy and says that her boyfriend loves the bagels, too."
TrollXChromosomes,fdw6x52,t1_fdsfejz,1578755704.0,"You assume that this does not happen to women, too.

“Sign of weakness” is code for “treated like a woman”.

Women, societally, aren’t “allowed” to cry, we are *expected to*, and then treated as second-class citizens for this expected emotionality. Also, in many situations, crying is simply read as emotional manipulation, anyway. Women get penalized plenty for crying. Men are actually, societally, more likely to be heard if tears erupt, vs women.

Meanwhile, women are, societally, not allowed to get angry, whereas men are, societally, expected to. 

However, men’s anger is societally read as a sign of legitimate grievance, and women are not treated like men if we show anger. 

Women can never ever manage to be treated like men.

Plus, there is the fact that plenty of women and girls are beat for crying, too.  

And, yet, women are expected to take on the emotional labor of men, by default?

Nah.
