Cats:NO. Cats don't digest well any kind of carbs and you poison them slowly. That's why way too many cats are diabetic."
AskReddit,ff8dog8,t1_ff86i9d,1579674164.0,"Other countries but something similar happened to me too. Way out no problems, no question asked. So I had passports of two different nationalities in my family and employees asked me for the birth certificate of my kids. No authority would release a passports without birth certificate and authorization granted by both parents, so I told them that. The person in charge said she couldn't trust just the passport as it could be faked and my surname and theirs was different, so I should have proof I'm married to my husband... Now she needs a marriage certificate as well.

In the end the employee called her boss and they let us cross the border as they realized I was *returning* to the country, not leaving it."

Source: I owned a pair of earrings with peacock feathers. I heard that stuff now and then.

Still, the majority of focus goes into theatrical/acting imagery, so when we notice the girl mourning, we crearly see she’s in mourning, but something is *off*, you can see she’s acting out. Or like when he represents Judith and she feels disgust, is a very *acted out* imagery.

The fee is 20% higher and the majority of the local families are rich and don't care.

mildlyinteresting,fdpoyu6,t3_emfqn8,1578635125.0,"All nice and dandy until the kindergarten asks for completely new clothing every season. We received several complaints for hand-me-downs brother to brother. They were checking the items and if they weren't branded with the names they wanted (specific Norwegian brands used in sports) they would send us a complaint. We ended up going to XXL every so and so, buy our stuff there and no cheaper because their brands were the most likely approved. Plenty times they came up with ill excuses. Nobody could even go after the daycare  employees because they were claiming the clothing was fitting poorly regardless. Strange enough brand new clothing from their approved brands was fitting just fine and simply perfect: anything that priced $50 or more was ok.
I couldn't afford that lifestyle, but I had to: times I disregarded the complaint, they escalated: so between a lawyer and I pair of pants, I take the pants. Also I asked a lot for clothing gifts for that season or buy fewer items, wash and dry within the same day.


Luckily the policy changed a year or so ago and I could reuse a pair of pants or something this year. Also public kindergartens/preschools have always been much better than that, sometimes storing on reselling old items."

Some of those relieves had sort of edges-ridges to represent the technique used by the artist, light directions, drawing lines. I found it pretty hard to understand by touch.

While I was living in the UK I wanted to try to make blind art through textures. It’s pretty much how blind people manage to paint (different colors for different textures), but the idea was to create an abstract exposition that could be enjoyed with both senses (see the painting and touch it through textures and relieves). Never went through because I had no idea how to arrange textures and shapes that way or what to use."

The mythology behind it described the kids of different ages as he ate right after he listened to the profecy/realized that the profecy was real. Also there's this weird ass legend that in XXVIII century a Count in southern Europe has been locked into a room with his family due to conspiracy or heresy, they've been forgotten and left for starve in his fortress. Eventually some members died of starvation and gossip told that the Count ate the corpses (or part of it) in order to survive. He had been discovered many months/years later and found alive so people took for granted he must have been done something horrible. 


The only part I find historically accurate is the beginning of the story, guess heresy and conspiracy were the old timers cancel culture...

It's not only big, it's tall (vertical) I think it's heavily deformed in pictures. I think it mirrors the shooting (3.may1808), so you enter the room and get into that first and when you shift focus, his eyes are right above and behind you (on your left). I got too overwhelmed to check that out."
