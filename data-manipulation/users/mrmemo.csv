No.  I'm white, and classifying myself as white doesn't make me a racist.  People are different races, that's not racism.  Thinking that someone is *less of a person* because of their race?  *That's* racism.

I'm not sure why you're trying to defend racism, or if you (as a white person) feel personally attacked when white people are called out on their racism.  In either case, I find your involvement odd, and I don't think you are making a cogent point -- just drawing focus away from the original discussion, which pertained to ""bots"" or ""NPCs"".

This will be my last response to you, I hope you have a better day!"

What bias?  For me to be biased, there would need to be sides to an argument; I'm not aware of ""sides"" here, only that the original response -- falsely claiming that the original comment was attacking white people for racism -- was a nonsequitor.  I don't need to pick a ""side"" in an argument to recognize a logical failing in an argument.

> ""Everyone nowadays is considered a racist""   

No.  But it sounds like maybe *you* are, as you are so quick to defend it?  Or, maybe, you just like arguing because you view discussions as zero-sum arguments that one person ""wins"" and one person ""loses"".  That doesn't seem productive either.

However, I do concede: you certainly don't seem like someone attempting to engage in an honest discussion.  Thank you for the cautionary warning!"

I'm *not* accusing them of lying -- Jack may indeed have MS -- but I am skeptical in general because of their tendency to self-diagnose (""I think I have [x]"").

Add to this, Jack was to participate in a show where people compete in *military training exercises*.  He couldn't perform the necessary tasks and was cut from the show, and the Osbornes screamed ""discrimination!"". It all smells off.
