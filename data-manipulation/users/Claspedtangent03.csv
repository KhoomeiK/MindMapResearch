Historical documents and personal accounts of people who knew him as well as interviews with Einstein himself say he had problems as a child with speech and so he actually went on to develop his visualization skills instead. He would perform what are called 'thought experiments', where he would pose a question and then imagine a scenario that would mimic this question in action. Its how he came up with the premise of many of his most famous theories. He didnt do it through AP though, he was more or less fully conscious and aware during these times.

Robert Lanza wrote Biocentrism which also has a form that supports the idea of quantum non locality of himan consciousness. You can read his published paper in the Annal Der Physik, but ill warn you right now the math is very high level. In essence, he is creating a reinterpretation of the collapse of the wave function. He postulates that consciousness itself is the cause for the collapse of the wave function which gives a definite state to an instance of matter. Its fascinating stuff. There is alot more high level and heavy science/mathematics and philosophy involved in this stuff than you might want to give it credit for.

AstralProjection,ffs8yxp,t1_ffriufa,1580176063.0,Reaching the vibrational state isnt the same as a kundalini awakening. Acessing your kundalini os at least described (i have not awakened my kundalini but i have APed before) as more of an intense feeling that can affect you for several days and manifest some physical symptoms from what i remember. Reaching the vibrational state is just the bridging state between the hypnagogic state and full OBE state. If i could best describe it (and its far from an accurate description) the vibrational state kinda feels like right when some salvia is kicking in before you feel fully dissociated but right when you can feel that 'suck' feeling. The actual buzzing noise during the vibrational state is more intense though. Sometimes with your eyes cloaed you might still see a flash of dull white.
