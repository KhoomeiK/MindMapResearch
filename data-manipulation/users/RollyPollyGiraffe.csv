FireEmblemHeroes,ffhqmzw,t1_ffhq9x3,1579948732.0,I never said the results are surprising - the midterm is along the state I expected and I am interested to see if the midterm effect pushes one or two non-3H into winner slots.
FireEmblemHeroes,ffhaz4p,t3_etmd1p,1579928366.0,It weirdly makes her look a lot like Lilina and my brain can't quite work it.

This is largely a bad thing *thematically*. This might go against your ""positive vibes only,"" thing, but it's not my aim to be a downer --- I'm Lysithea and Dimitri neutral and like Claude and Edelgard, so a CYL result being those four would be simply ""whelming"" for me.  


But CYL has enjoyed the distinction of not having more than a winner from a game in each cycle. It's become something of a celebration of the series writ large - like a slice of the whole of FEH itself in a ""perfect"" way. Yes, some CYLs have had character drama, but the end results have mostly been representative (although FE6+ biased...).  


A full game sweep CYL is just fundamentally wrong to me. I could adore all four characters and I'd still feel that way. But then I'm very conflicted, because I do feel bad for the folks who have been waiting for more 3H and have gotten pretty shafted - if they go from a midterm sweep to a post-midterm not sweep, that will feel awful.  


I guess this did end up mildly not-positive, but I figure it's reasonable since it isn't salt and more just a written furrowed brow of concern."
