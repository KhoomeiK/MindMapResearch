SeasonalAffective,fglj6hf,t3_ez0lqa,1580900454.0,The person who commented first has great suggestions. I've also found that if I do something to get my blood pumping first thing in the morning via put on my favorite music and go for a walk even when it's gray and crappy puts me in a better mood for the rest of the day. Also have rainbow Christmas lights hung up in my living room and turn them on when I feel blue.

todayilearned,fglijn9,t1_fgix70k,1580899552.0,Well on college campuses it's easy to buy and sell after someone gets their scrip filled but outside of a college campus I've never heard of an Adderall black market... Those who need it just take it and those who don't need it aren't interested once there are no more finals to cram for or take cocaine instead if they work in finance or law
