I'm a non-white high school senior considering IU's business program as my second choice and I've already gotten in but this just affirms my decision to not go there. Don't exactly want a professor who thinks he's smarter than me because he's got less melanin. Oh well, their loss of my life savings. 

Anyway, it's funny that these schools are considered ""federally funded"". Then why do you want 40 THOUSAND dollars a year from me??

(I know they're federally funded, it's just funny that we're the only country that's going to give schools tons of money and still have extorbitant costs. I'm not advocating for debt forgiveness but we need to lower the price on college asap)."

IncelTears,ffeipq1,t1_ffecz5c,1579849627.0,"Literally 99% of people that are ""ugly"" just need some basic grooming lmao. I still consider myself ugly (and there's nothing wrong with that! Doesn't make me flawed or undatable I just got a couple fucked genetics) but also I definitely think that I look way better because I take the time to actually work on my hair/eyebrows/skin/clothing etc. (Also I did get an unsolicited compliment on my looks for the first time ever today so my self esteem is at an all time high) 

It really makes me sad reading these incel threads bc it's like dude if you put in as much effort into just basic hygiene/grooming and just being a likable person as you did into whining about not having a girlfriend online, you could just have a girlfriend possibly because I'm sure you look good when you take the time to do basic upkeep on your appearance, like literally everyone does."
