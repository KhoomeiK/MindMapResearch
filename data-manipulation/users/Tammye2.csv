He learned to play piano because he met the love of his life, just as Pam had done. He and Pam both  got out of the same bad relationship that they had been stuck in since HIGH SCHOOL and they both grew and flourished. Pam‚Äôs life might be boring to you but it wasn‚Äôt to her. And it‚Äôs unfair to call it ‚Äúaimless‚Äù. She was married to the love of her life, working with him too, raising 2 children and even pursuing her dream of being an artist in her spare time. Just because she wasn‚Äôt working on the cure for cancer doesn‚Äôt mean her life was ‚Äúaimless‚Äù."
