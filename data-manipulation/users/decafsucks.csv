college,ffil3ln,t3_esy66h,1579976456.0,"If you can take a 20 min nap sometime before class, that may help (of course, I'd aim to do it as early as possible so it doesn't affect the next morning as much).

Also, bring some cold water and snacks!"
college,ffik4cf,t3_etfepz,1579975780.0,"I would say it's doable, as long as you are going into things with good study/time management habits (and a planner). If you still want to keep the same end date but take less classes at once, can you take a class or two over the summers? Ultimately, you know yourself best - but finishing later than you imagined is still valid and is still a degree :)"
getdisciplined,ffgf630,t1_ffbpvib,1579904861.0,"Adding on to what  u/very_betic said, they also make alarm apps for your phone that don't go off until you scan a specific barcode. You can make it something in the kitchen or bathroom, so you have to get up to make the alarm shut up.

Just make sure you don't throw away item with the barcode you scan for the alarm! If you're scared that'll happen, you can cut out the barcode and tape it up. I would tape it to the bathroom mirror, or maybe the coffee maker to help you wake up :)

Best of luck!"

college,fe5u88k,t3_entzbt,1578875054.0,"I'm going into week 2 tomorrow morning, but I've been going strong so far. The classes I'm in have been a lot more writing-heavy and require more studying than I'm used to, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

Good luck to everyone!! <3"
college,fe5tu5n,t1_fe4oiwr,1578874800.0,"I dunno, week 2 starts tomorrow for me and I've been absolutely drowning. Fall semester the first week was super easy so part of it depends on what classes you're taking"
