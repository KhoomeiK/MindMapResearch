MurderedByWords,ff96udm,t1_ff942ks,1579706220.0,You're making assumptions about me. I know the things you're saying. I'd rather not say what country for privacy reasons. I'll gladly concede the developed point on that basis. But change it to Western and Australia and the USA are both further right than most maybe all other Western countries.
MurderedByWords,ff93do8,t1_ff8ysv2,1579703860.0,"Change the wording to Western then, same idea. I have lived in one of those countries and I can tell you for sure they are not all more right or even as far right as the USA."

ShitAmericansSay,ff2rzys,t1_ff2myu9,1579521567.0,So it's not completely accurate. We seem to be agreeing on that point.
ShitAmericansSay,ff2rwci,t1_ff2njis,1579521430.0,Ok then. It does make it an imperfect measure if you're measuring obesity if we define obesity as a percentage of body fat. Doesn't mean it's not useful it's just not very accurate. Its a useful estimation of body fat content.
ShitAmericansSay,ff2ilvw,t1_ff2fbym,1579507757.0,"Sorry, those are two different ideas, perhaps I wasn't clear.

Using bmi doesn't make you look like an asshole, using that SpongeBob meme text does.

BMI is inaccurate because it doesn't differentiate between different body tissues. That is true. The person above tried to make it sound ridiculous by using ThIs wRiTiNg style, but it's not. Just search for ""BMI accuracy"". That doesn't mean it's useless, it's a reasonable approximation for many people, but it's also not an accurate measure."
ShitAmericansSay,ff2dphl,t1_ff2b73u,1579501948.0,"So are you saying bmi is accurate? Because it's not... Is it good enough to make this generalization across a population? For that purpose it's probably good enough, but using the SpongeBob idiot letters makes it look you're saying bmi is an accurate measure when it's simply an approximation, thereby making you look LiKe THe GuY wHo TaLks LiKe tHiS.

Tldr: Stop using that shit, it just makes you like an asshole."

I think ""wow that guy's unstable"" and never think about it again. On the flip side, spoiling something I've been looking forward to for weeks very tangibly affects my enjoyment of it and how I will watch it. That's worse to me.
