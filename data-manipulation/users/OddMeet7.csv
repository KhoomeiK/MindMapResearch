Plus they put them in turbo mode and ride up the downhill trails instead of going around the fire road way like normal. Trails are getting wider and there's more uphill traffic to content with but the world didn't really end. But these trails were pretty packed to begin with (Space Mountain, El Prieto) and they are only out when it's 75F and sunny spring perfect weather so it's not really that big of a deal. Plus they are keeping the bike industry afloat."

cars,fdhassw,t1_fdgr8cu,1578419041.0,"Something similar has been happening in the bicycle business for years. Everyone wants to jump on ebikes so a lot of weird overlap is occurring. There's some eBike-only brands (Haibike, Juiced), regular bike brands (Specialized, Cannondale, Giant, Trek, etc), motorcycle (Harley, Yamaha) and tons of Chinese domestic market companies trying to muscle in. 

Bosch seems to be the biggest winner as they build the motors for the legit stuff. 

Granted everyone has been dabbling in electric cars for years but as far as recent tech and success it sort of lines up - First you had the brands that were built solely on electric cars (Tesla, Fisker), then established guys got in (GM, Nissan, BMW) now it's anyone who sees an opportunity.  

That's a huge simplification obviously but you get the idea."
