Again, I’m not saying that religion is inherently bad or that religious people are bad. But religion certainly has produced a lot of negative things. 

One problem that religions have is that there is not a consensus of interpretation, this is way you have a wide variety of sects in Christianity alone. Where you have disagreement, you will have individuals foisting their interpretation on others. You can look to the Islamic world to see the damaging and oppressive elements of caliphates."

atheism,fffsbv3,t1_ffeyqao,1579890728.0,"How can there be existence without parameters? It’s like having a game without rules, it can’t exist. It is at the parameters that we meet our limitations which often manifest in tragedy or “evil”. We do not entirely have free will, I couldn’t fly or breathe just because I will it. I can only operate semi autonomously within the bounds of limitation. 

Therefore, all things stem from God, but this doesn’t mean that all things are equal. In order to choose what is virtuous, ethical, loving etc, I need to have the option to chose their opposites. You wouldn’t say that the designer of a game is “evil” because they put conditions in the game that can cause you to lose. You would see these conditions as necessary because the overall goal of the game justifies the obstacles.

alcoholism,ffa0f4f,t1_ff8utdy,1579725362.0,"I still get the impression that you assume that a higher power means “god”. Even if the authors personal biases come through in the book, they make it very clear that the spirit of it all is to find your own higher power. I.e. anything that isn’t you. Some people use the group as their higher power, some use their sponsor, it really doesn’t matter. Again, this goes back to the idea of the ego being overridden and untrustworthy. The alcoholic needs something other than self to rely on, it’s that simple. 

As far as the bullshit meter is concerned, I’d be very cautious of that. Of course there is a ton of bullshit in AA and it’s not very wise to be naive to that. On the other hand, it might close you off from hearing something that might be very beneficial."

As time went on and my DUI’s were getting cleared up, I started to realize the weight of what this man was truly saying. The horror of alcoholism had me in its grips. Circumstances be damned. Jobs, school, relationships, my health, these all meant nothing to me. I lived to drink. Alcohol was my master. This didn’t happen over night though, alcohol is more charming and crafty than that. This is a progressive disease with progressive consequences. 

With all this being said, I’ll say to you exactly what this man from AA told me. You have bigger problems than the courts. There is hope though. You could seek the resources that you’ve mentioned, that would be a great start. You could also give AA a shot, the benefit being that you will meet many people who have been through exactly what you’re going through and they will share their experience and wisdom with you.

alcoholicsanonymous,ff7jz1y,t3_es2mjw,1579651337.0,You can seek medical help for alcoholism. One thing that AA offers that doctors and psychologists don’t is a community and a fellowship. You can use AA for what works and seek outside help for the things that AA isn’t able to address.
alcoholism,ff7gw5e,t1_ff70qpm,1579649267.0,"Alcohol was a higher power for me. It’s not very difficult to understand the concept of a higher power when I view it this way. The problem was, my higher power was a tyrant. 

The main reason AA suggests a “higher power” is because the ego of the alcoholic or addict has essentially become overrun or hijacked by the disease. Whatever we were orienting ourselves around (mainly selfishness, self centeredness, greed, and surly some virtue in between) had failed us. Therefore we need something new to orient ourselves around (service, altruism, spirituality, humility etc.). This is a moral program, conceptions of a higher power are as numerous and idiosyncratic as the individuals that make up AA. 

It’s helpful for me to remember that when someone says “God” in AA, I have no right to assume what they mean by it. I could assume that they’re talking about a straw man depiction of God which is easy for me to reject and discount, but then I’ve made a huge mistake. I’ve created a point of difference based on pure assumption. Part of the point of the program is to go beyond assumptions in the attempt to experience something new. 

As far as using the Lord’s Prayer, many people find it easy to use religious traditions that are already in place. In my experience it’s often interchanged with the serenity prayer or the third step prayer. Never once have I heard a group ask for people to “come to Christ”.
