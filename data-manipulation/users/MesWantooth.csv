AmItheAsshole,ffyja5x,t1_ffyithu,1580347760.0,"I think it's common sense to think a new vacation will make it up to her. She was not ditched. There was a documentation error that could not be fixed. Not her fault. Not her Dad's fault. Not the family's fault. The mom gets the blame for this. And by my logic, actually, the other kids are super young and will be even less likely the understand and more likely to blame the older sister. Or just be bitter and angry about it. But I stand by my thinking that if at some point she realized the rest of her family sacrificed a vacation they saved up for, lost thousands of dollars, and no one could go on vacation - she'd regret that decision. But of course we can disagree."

AmItheAsshole,ffyikif,t1_ffyhwvi,1580347273.0,"I disagree, that is not heartless. The child is safe with their grandparent and is 14 years old, not 8. She could get a one-on-on vacation out of it with her dad later or NO ONE goes on vacation. That's not heartless. That's being practical. If the 14 year old has a conscious, she would eventually feel incredibly guilty that she made the whole family cancel and lose thousands of dollars and no one got a vacation. Especially when there was a perfectly reasonable 'Plan B' right there. I would feel terrible knowing I caused that. And the other kids will resent her too. Sometimes you have to roll with the punches and a month or two later, when the 14 year old is lying the beach, I guarantee she'll be happy and not thinking ""Damn, I wish all ya'll had canceled that trip so NO ONE could go."""

The 14 year old has every right to be upset but nothing anybody could have done would have helped her one bit, unless she'd derive pleasure knowing everyone else was upset and miserable too. Not to mention, a 14 yr old is probably capable of understanding ""There's no way we can afford to take the entire family on vacation a second time, but we can afford to take you on vacation when this passport situation is figured out.

Sometimes you may overindulge. And that's should be okay...sometimes. 

Like I think, if the goal of a diet is to lose 'the weight' and be forever at this goal weight - that may be a herculean task requiring all your energy and focus. What if you are comfortable that during the winter, around the Holidays, you're going to gain 10-15 lbs. Then when spring comes, you get more active and you lose that weight and feel great. Than you really step it up so you feel good at the beach during the summer. Than during football season, you drink more beer and snack during games and that 10 lbs comes back.

Totally separately, one thing I have noticed with young children when they first start to fib - I feel like they come by it honestly...that sounds contradictory but what I mean is that in some instances, when they are asked a question, they know that answering the question is what you want and/or they may know what response you would be most pleased to hear, and they give you that -thinking it's the 'right' thing, not really trying to deceive. For example, when my daughter was 3, I recall that sometimes if you ask her a question and she can't quite come up with an answer - you can see her making something up because she knows you want a response (and not a situation where the response could lead to getting in trouble). As such, I could see ""Did you throw the ball and break the vase?"" being met with ""No."" from a 2-3 year old, not necessarily trying to deceive or avoid getting in trouble but providing an answer the child thinks the adult wants to hear.

AmItheAsshole,ffuq0f8,t1_fftcwbj,1580247109.0,"Great response. I will, however, politely disagree with you on the conclusion. OP's blindingly-biased narrative makes it hard to believe all the positive characteristics ascribed to the little girl, but if most of those attributes are true, and she's known to be very honest and she articulates in no uncertain terms that she never went in that room and never climbed on a desk - as a parent, I think you should take the word of your child. To not do so could really hurt them and their trust in you as a parent, if they are telling the truth. 

If the niece is - still, at this age - known to point fingers and lie about other people, the parents will have an idea if she's doing it again. 

OP should definitely pay the niece for babysitting. She should believe her daughter. But she should also talk over the situation privately with the Niece's mom - this is not worth blowing up a family relationship over. Maybe they could split the cost of the laptop?"

But further to this - and this bothers some people - my understanding is that the maximum life span of a human has not really changed much over the years. It's around 100 years old, give or take. Far fewer people made it to 100 in the 1800's vs. today, but some did. There may be therapies and medical research coming down the pipe that will extend the maximum lifespan,  but it's not like the percentage of people living to 105-115 now vs. decades ago has changed dramatically.

\-Sitcoms often have scenes where characters enter or exit the house. It would take up too much time to have them putting on or removing shoes.

I hope you explained it to her like you did to us - your job is quite hard and you are used to sleepless nights...Aside from that - way to go Dad! Many Dad's get very overwhelmed. It should absolutely be celebrated that it went well for you. 

You should tell your wife that the good news is that she can take some time away here and there - since you are fully capable of taking care of things at home! My wife would be thrilled."
AmItheAsshole,ffgecu1,t1_ffefo34,1579904350.0,"I'm sure that may be common occurrence, however I know one example where the dad is very fair, measured, calm, and reasonable and the mom tends to be a total bitch whenever she is stressed and the kids treat the dad with mutual respect but lose their shit on their mom."
AmItheAsshole,ffgduak,t3_et5qoq,1579904029.0,"NAH...this is definitely weird territory. I get why it may be easier to have strangers raise your kid - out of sight, out of mind..And if your brother is raising your biological son or daughter and makes parenting choices that bother you - you will feel way more compelled to say something. From your brother's perspective, I can absolutely see why he'd like the child to share genes with him. Are there any other more distant female relatives who could provide this? A cousin? Tough ask anyway.

I know a lovely same-sex couple who each fertilized one egg that was placed inside a surrogate and both embryos grew to term and now they have two beautiful twins. They decided they never wanted to learn who fathered which kid but its very obvious which one is half black."

IAmA,fffwvq1,t3_et588g,1579893570.0,"Your work is incredible! I'm so glad I found your instagram page. What typically happens to these play houses when the kids get older? Are they removed or kept as momentos or for grandchildren? How about if the house is sold, could the family have it deconstructed and taken with them? Final question - do you ever have parents insist that the design be such that it can evolve from a playhouse to a study when the kid is older or a private area where teenage friends can hang out?"

vancouver,ffft7hd,t3_etbfc1,1579891275.0,"Guys, I don't know. Lets not be too hasty here. I propose we let every other major city in the world continue to be the ""guinea pig"" or ""the canary in the coal mine"" - after 3, 4 decades, we can then look at how those Cities are doing with ride sharing. Some of these Cities may not even exist as we know them now - they'll be barren wastelands with mad-max vehicles racing around looking for customers to rape & stab. 

We have nice, clean Priuses, driven by people who are sometimes in a good mood. And who needs to get anywhere in under an hour, anyways? Is life a Formula-1 race?"

AMA,fffp75m,t1_ffelz89,1579888793.0,"Thanks for your response - I really like the clarification that recalling things is a skill but deeply understanding requires intelligence. Good luck to you. You mentioned dropping out of college - was is just not doing anything for you? What is your plan? You're 20 so plenty of time try different things or travel or do whatever. Going to guess that with your level of intelligence, a formal education is not necessarily the most direct path to a fulfilling career. Cheers."

AmItheAsshole,ffdpkdw,t3_estcud,1579825917.0,"I want to cut you some slack and say NAH. You are both exhausted new parents not at their very best. Feeling frustrated about the sleep deprivation and constantly having to walk around is normal. Your wife is probably picking up on it because your body language and maybe the things you say, the sighs and eye-rolling, are telling her that you are frustrated caring for your newborn - maybe try to lighten up on the displays of emotion.

That said, if you are frustrated toward the baby - as if it's her fault - you need to quit that. I just realized you wrote this is your 3rd child - is the level of care required really a surprise to you? Or is it that your wife did it all before?

Last thing - if you feel frustrated toward your daughter and need a second to regroup, just put her down in a safe place and walk away. She will cry, but she will be perfectly safe. Frustrated parents someones act roughly with screaming babies when they are at their wits-end. My wife and I did this on a few occasions. In the crib, step out of the room, regroup, head back in.

Babies can also pick up on this frustration and it makes it worse - trying to rock a screaming baby and you find yourself gritting your team and rocking or bouncing a bit more vigorously then you were before - these movements cease to be comforting."
