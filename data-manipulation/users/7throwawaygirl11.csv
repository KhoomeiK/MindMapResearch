You’re inspiring, good job!"
offmychest,ffmq5kp,t1_ffmphgz,1580057817.0,"I’m sorry. If you do ever want to talk, send me a dm, being cheated on is one of the most dehumanizing things because you feel used, and not enough. But remember, this wasn’t your fault, it was his, he’s the one who cheated, while you stayed loyal."
offmychest,ffmo6w4,t1_ffmn78l,1580057207.0,"You did absolutely nothing wrong. Cheating isn’t about someone not being enough. Look at all those beautiful talented, rich celebrities women getting cheated on constantly. It’s the other person who cheats that is too weak to stay with one person so they go find fun elsewhere. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with polygamy as long as everyone involved agrees to it. But if you agree that you only want each other and they go cheat, that makes them weak, they should just go poly. You’re not the problem, he is.
You can’t avoid someone cheating on you, it happens unexpectedly to so many people, even after years of marriage, but what you can do is deal with it the best way possible, which in my opinion is to cut off that person for good. Don’t show them that they hurt you because they already know, and most likely don’t care. Show no emotion, cut them off, move on with your life. It’s hard but you can do it, I believe in you."
offmychest,ffmmgdq,t1_ffml6tw,1580056674.0,This. The closure here is that he’s an asshole and doesn’t care for op.
offmychest,feo7joh,t3_eq44xi,1579296228.0,There is a LOT to unpack here.
offmychest,felelhe,t3_epr3cu,1579220349.0,"People you see in your dreams are people you’ve seen , maybe not in person but online as well.

But some people say you can also see people from the future or past lives in your dreams."
offmychest,fedioi8,t3_eogtpf,1579012522.0,Thank you. Getting off my phone now.
imvu,fe9vtzv,t1_fe59kou,1578941865.0,Lol hey it’s me again. Just ran into a guy who said women not reporting rape is stupid because it gives a false rape percentage. I was so livid. Then I remembered the same advice I gave you about not worrying about trash like that.
offmychest,fe5y93l,t3_enqhje,1578877613.0,"It means you feel insecure about the relationship. Your boyfriend needs to make you feel secure, if he isn’t make sure you communicate that with him."
offmychest,fe5dq51,t1_fe53bew,1578868182.0,"Head over to r/legaladvice
Explain your situation well for some feedback and good luck!"
imvu,fe49chx,t1_fe43p8r,1578856979.0,"I know how that can be, people can be cruel sometimes, especially online. But don’t let their negativity affect your positivity. Those people literally have it so bad that they feel the need to spend their time hating on other groups just to feel better about themselves because that’s the only way they can feel superior. Lots of people like that but don’t let them get to you, it’s what they want."
imvu,fe3328k,t3_enfar9,1578845447.0,What happened?
offmychest,fdg8abp,t3_el5k3t,1578384242.0,Not even joking. This is exactly what I needed.

offmychest,fclxwth,t3_ehuw9v,1577759171.0,It’s called a cuck fetish. One guy I was seeing had it and it was fine until he tried to force it upon me after I told him I was uncomfortable with it.
imvu,fclj5h3,t1_fcliwwj,1577749009.0,Wow how unfair
