DnD,ff6bujh,t1_ff68z3q,1579623785.0,"Don't punish him mechanicaly for his roleplay desire. Simply make him put up with awkward male gaze everywhere he goes, and make sure that the gazers are either strong enough or plentiful enough that fighting isn't a good option. He can leverage his roleplay one way, and you can hit him with the other side of the coin.
Being objectively attractive comes with being objectified.
Chances are he is either going to get tired of the shtick and stop making it an issue in RP or he will do something brash and ill advised, giving you an opportunity to close the whole book on the issue."

They seeded their own universe with tech, they didn't seed 40k. The prompt never mentioned anything about them having access to 40k tech. Even IF they did, they are going to get trounced by any of the races that can utilize the webway. The dark eldar fire black holes, craft worlds make the citadel look like a funny little footnote. Reapers have a laser battery that can be dodged by a human on foot ffs. How in the warp are they going to compete with any race in 40k?"

The biggest actual threat they possess is the admech going rogue if they decide they are a better embodiment of the omnissiah. Beyond that almost every facton has larger ships with a wider array of more devastating firepower. I imagine that most Titans would stomp a reaper solo, nevermind the Navy of any faction."
