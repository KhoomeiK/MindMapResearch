AskMen,fgk4u43,t1_fgjfaap,1580857512.0,"I'm a pastor - I shake hands with my entire congregation every Sunday.

Here's the exception: shaking hands with kids. They often just don't KNOW how to shake hands. 

So, I take a moment every Sunday to ""correct"" weak handshakes. If I get a limp hand, I'll hold on to it for a moment, and say, ""okay, now GRIP"" while smiling at them.

And they do! They learn. I've got some kids who are 7 and 8 years old who shake hands very well. I'm proud of the young men and women they are becoming."

unpopularopinion,fgjn711,t3_eyn3ft,1580847493.0,"According to your logic, we could just as arbitrarily replace K with Q.

So, not only would we have Quick, Quiet, Queen...

but we'd have Qick the football, Qangaroo, Qarate, Qazoo, a Qegger party, you could qeep your dog in a qennel, have some qetchup with your burger, all qinds of things. Pretty qeen, right?

Oh, and my favorite: Star Trek would have Qlingons."
ProRevenge,fgjja8a,t3_eyuocd,1580845208.0,"You know, at first, I would have just thought this was /r/pettyrevenge.

But then I began to think a bit deeper...

This is a young man who is NOT in a position of power to execute truly ""pro"" revenge. He's certainly not in any professional capacity, as he's only a 16 year old student.

But what he IS doing is a systematic undermining of this step-monster's relationships. And that attention to social interaction is pretty effective.

And yes, OP's spelling isn't great. But perhaps, in reading these comments, he'll realize that paying attention to ""minor"" issues like spelling really does shape how others view you.

OP - as a Christian pastor, I'm not going to pretend that revenge is a great thing; there is more freedom found in forgiveness than revenge (even if you're not a person of faith). That being said...

Making sure that this guy can't continue his abuse is a very good thing."
linuxaudio,fgi2co5,t3_eygnx0,1580802331.0,"Okay, caveat: I've never used a software sampler. With that in mind...

Have any of you tried the humble LMMS?

You can load a .wav file of ANYTHING and play it on a keyboard. You can point a midi file of jingle bells at a sample of your cat, and meow away.

Is that sample-ish enough? I was blown away when I found I could do that."
DaystromInstitute,fghgl50,t1_fggdi30,1580784348.0,"if you haven't read them, I'd really recommend the Star Trek: Rihannsu books. They explain in greater detail the process of how Surak won the Vulcan heart to logic - and how the Rihannsu (Romulans) couldn't accept his teachings and left Vulcan.

They're not canon - but Spock DOES canonically reference the Sundering (which is mentioned in the books. And they're a GREAT read - Dr. McCoy gets some great scenes in them.)"
DaystromInstitute,fggalix,t3_eyaoqh,1580757809.0,"Neat idea.

Except it completely undermines established canon on how the Vulcans gain logic through the work of ~~Sarek~~ SURAK.

You're right, though... it certainly would ""break minds"".

EDIT - fixed a mistyped name. I was *not* meaning Spock's dad."

IAmA,fg7cnn4,t3_ex9gmq,1580589307.0,"I have a great 27 year old man in my congregation. He is handsome, fit, well employed, and active in his community. Loves his mom, is kind, funny, and is dedicated to making a better world.

He is also dedicated to finding a woman who loves Jesus first and foremost, who will challenge his own spiritual growth.

Sadly, in our little community, he has been unable to find a woman who is interested in living a similar life based on their faith.

There are few churches here: all small, and no University close by.

Where would you suggest he start looking? He's not interested in a hook-up; he wants someone with whom he can build a life."

So, one night at a party, I announced that while I would *prefer* Ed, I understand that some OLD PEOPLE just aren't mentally flexible, and couldn't be expected to call me Ed.

Thereafter, whenever someone would call me ""Eddie"", I would pointedly *not* correct them, while plastering a condescending look on my face.

They immediately back-pedaled!

Coffee,ffyj35s,t1_ffw0qez,1580347627.0,"I think there's a challenge with a moka pot, in that the holes in the moka pot filter are much larger than super-fine size.

If you could install a super-fine size mesh IN the moka pot, it would probably work. But I'm unsure as to where you'd get that.

Another option: it's not exactly ""espresso"" because it's not pulled under pressure, but an Areopress with a super-fine filter makes a pretty great cup of coffee. I've had very good results with my Areopress (when I don't want to be bothered with setting up the espresso machine)."

Reformed,ffvatbn,t1_ffv0c1j,1580259750.0,"I am not mistaken at all. Here's the story:

At 17 yrs old, before I was a follower of Jesus, I was in an English class with Mr. Larsen. He was an excellent teacher, and he was doing a unit on irony.

He read us Judges 4, especially verse 21 in the King James. I'll post it:

> Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.

What caught our attention was the last small sentence. ""So he died."" 

Well, YEAH. He'd just had his brains NAILED TO THE FLOOR. I'm pretty sure that death is the logical consequence. Mr. Larsen pointed out that this was such an understatement that it qualified as irony.

And THAT really got my attention. I asked him, ""are there more stories like this in the Bible"" - and he responded affirmatively.

So, Judges 4:21 led me to read all of Judges (a wonderful horrific gory book, perfect for a teenage boy). And THAT led me to read Joshua (a book of battles and conquest), and THAT led me to keep reading the Bible as a fascinating piece of literature. 

I started reading Scripture, which led me to Jesus... all because of Judges 4:21."
linuxquestions,ffus81i,t3_evc4ge,1580248376.0,"VLC does this well. Here's how.

Make a list of all the songs you want to listen to in a text file. For example, all of my music is stored in one directory, with many subdirectories for each album:

    /Music/Various - 1992 - Art 4 The Ears Vol. 7/02-Jon Gibson-Forever Friends.mp3
    /Music/Late Late Service - 1997 - Dry Bones Dancing/02-We Believe.mp3
    /Music/Jim Croce - 1973 - Life & Times/3 - dreamin' again.mp3
    /Music/Various - 1995 - My Utmost for His Highest/01-You are Holy-4 Him.mp3

I dump the list for all of my songs into a text file, and save it as ""mymusic.list"". I then randomly sort the text file like this:

    sort -R ""mymusic.list"" > ""myrandomsort.list""

Then, I open VLC, and use the Media menu to open ""myrandomsort.list"" as a file. it detects it as a list of songs, and starts playing them.

Down at the bottom of the VLC player, there's a ""shuffle"" button. There you go, randomly shuffled.

Hope that helps!"
