books,ff4b6ux,t3_ercxjc,1579559540.0,I personally think so but I am also here just to say I have received finished a great book called The Ten Thousand Doors of January and it was so magical. It gave me all the Narnia feels and is based for an adult audience.

bulletjournal,fc69taj,t1_fc64x3x,1577475577.0,I’ve had it for a while but only just got into it the last couple of months! It’s so good and is so relaxing to play.  It’s awesome how much love was put into creating the game!
bulletjournal,fc60au6,t1_fc5tt8y,1577469466.0,Thank you! Stardew is such a cute game and would make the perfect spreads!
bulletjournal,fc5ipte,t1_fc5emgt,1577458695.0,Thank you! :)
bulletjournal,fc5betm,t1_fc57793,1577452104.0,It’s so pretty! They have a great selection :)
bulletjournal,fc5bdod,t1_fc581k1,1577452069.0,"Me too! Thank you, I was really worried about getting the colours to blend the way I wanted!"
bulletjournal,fc55zcg,t1_fc4dsdk,1577444948.0,They are great!
bulletjournal,fc55yrs,t1_fc513oy,1577444923.0,Definitely! The Stardew music is so relaxing

Thank you! :)"
bulletjournal,fc4nwdq,t1_fc4n8do,1577422324.0,Love the game and drawing it was so fun! Kind of easy too! :)
bulletjournal,fc4lnxp,t1_fc4l0pi,1577420338.0,My journal is A5! It’s the perfect size for me because it’s not too big but also great to do spreads etc!
bulletjournal,fc4d02y,t1_fc4chnz,1577413106.0,He is! :)
bulletjournal,fc4cyx5,t1_fc4bwp8,1577413079.0,Awesome! Thank you. I have been looking for some cute stickers.
bulletjournal,fc475me,t1_fc46s2v,1577408436.0,Oh nice! What stickers did you use?
bulletjournal,fc44dpu,t1_fc40145,1577406327.0,He is! All his gifts were so thoughtful. Throughout December he would also do “treasure hunts” for me with clues to find for the date we were going on. I’m so appreciative!
bulletjournal,fc448k4,t1_fc3o414,1577406220.0,I love it! It’s so cute and bright!
bulletjournal,fc41rp2,t1_fc41042,1577404359.0,Ghosting doesn’t really bother me to be honest! Had the same journal last year and was fine. So far so good with the markers too! Thanks for the advice though I will be careful :)
bulletjournal,fc3ztwm,t1_fc3zg5s,1577402905.0,Crayola do such a good job and so cheap when you want to get lots in a pack! Some stationery sets are expensive just because of the brand name and end up being the exact same quality. It reminds me of the time I bought expensive watercolours and ended up just going back to my £5 ones!
bulletjournal,fc3zm5i,t1_fc3z7ph,1577402745.0,That’s such a good idea! I used that website last year and often forgotten what font I wanted for when I actually needed it. Thanks!
BeAmazed,fc3zbxc,t3_efx6q4,1577402533.0,Cute view but definitely doesn’t look like that right now. Was there a couple of days ago and Houses of Parliament and Big Ben are all under construction!
bulletjournal,fc3z49l,t1_fc3yyyh,1577402375.0,"I just found them on Amazon, thank you again. To be honest all the watercolours I have bought in the past have been cheap ones, sometimes you can’t even tell the difference. I love how your page looks and the shimmer effect looks awesome! Will definitely be buying these."
bulletjournal,fc3yost,t1_fc3yirm,1577402050.0,Seriously? I will do! Thanks so much!
bulletjournal,fc3ymdj,t1_fc3u3q1,1577401999.0,"Bullet Journalling is our hobby to do together that we started last year, I’ve been wanting this stuff for so long, made me so happy to see he got me it! 

It’s super fun to do together and can be a cheap little date night sometimes with some wine haha"
bulletjournal,fc3yih2,t1_fc3jdid,1577401917.0,"Haha you just gotta hint! Thank you, you also :)"
bulletjournal,fc3ygdl,t1_fc3nixk,1577401873.0,Such an awesome colour!

bulletjournal,fc3ycxy,t1_fc395en,1577401804.0,Maybe ;)
bulletjournal,fc3ybxy,t1_fc3y1k0,1577401782.0,"Don’t think they are on UK Amazon but I will look out for them, thank you!"
bulletjournal,fc3xq3d,t3_eg0wqu,1577401326.0,What watercolours are those? So pretty!
bulletjournal,fc3w8na,t1_fc3vzck,1577400230.0,They are awesome!! Enjoy journaling in your new one :)
bulletjournal,fc3w67d,t1_fc3van1,1577400180.0,Wait no Tombrow Brush Pens sorry! They are really awesome and I strongly recommend!
bulletjournal,fc3v8y3,t1_fc3u9d7,1577399504.0,Trying to be as colourful as possible !!
bulletjournal,fc3v76a,t1_fc3oete,1577399469.0,Sharpies! Not for drawing directly on to the journal but for any drawings I might do to stick in. Thank you :)
bulletjournal,fc3v32t,t1_fc3j5yn,1577399387.0,I have been saying how much I want them for SO long! I was not expecting to have four packs though!
bulletjournal,fc3uz0y,t1_fc3kj5h,1577399304.0,Definitely!
bulletjournal,fc3uy1b,t1_fc3ui9p,1577399284.0,Good plan! I love this sub always giving me good ideas haha
bulletjournal,fc3upbq,t1_fc3l41j,1577399108.0,"Woo! I’m getting started too, I love having a new journal but I try and be so careful that I don’t mess anything up, but once I’m at the end of the year everything is a little bit messier lol. Have a great 2020!"
bulletjournal,fc3ulh7,t1_fc3n2hc,1577399029.0,They do have a great selection!
bulletjournal,fc3ukbb,t1_fc3g1wp,1577399005.0,"I LOVE it!! My last one was grey and I liked it but I love some colour, especially the yellow!"
bulletjournal,fc3uhlr,t1_fc3n1kt,1577398949.0,People downvoted you but actually good job on marketing here lol. Hope you manage to get some sales!
bulletjournal,fc3udgk,t1_fc3i0oo,1577398865.0,"To be honest my last journal I used watercolour with the same brand. They don’t bleed through but they do ghost and make the pages kind of wrinkly sometimes ( don’t know how to describe it lol) . But weird enough I actually like it that about it. If you check my previous post, The Corpse Bride weekly spread you it doesn’t look bad at all, and it didn’t ghost or bleed. Everyone has their preferences though! Hope you find one that you like."
bulletjournal,fc34uex,t1_fc33v88,1577381463.0,They are great! I love how well they blend. A pen test page is a really good idea
bulletjournal,fc34rl9,t1_fc2y9ek,1577381408.0,He did!
bulletjournal,fc2tw1b,t1_fc2t9md,1577373907.0,Oh I will look into those thank you. I did make that mistake with last years journal but now I just use them for drawings that I stick into the journal instead of actually on the pages. Thank you for the advice!
RoastMe,f7ezz8c,t3_dvrdhp,1573669450.0,You look like Syndrome from The Incredibles
