Gary_The_Cat,fgv126j,t3_f0aws7,1581134176.0,Iconic mountains! Iconic cat!
Gary_The_Cat,fgqwgln,t1_fgqlc7f,1581032940.0,I guess Gary is tough as nails!
Gary_The_Cat,fgqhyt6,t3_ezsqqo,1581024536.0,Does Gary’s coat use Velcro? Any problem with his long fur getting caught in the Velcro?
aww,fgpaa6n,t1_fgot413,1581000594.0,Maine Coons certainly are a very friendly and loving breed from what I can see. Our two certainly are. Did your girl still have large extremities but a small body as an adult? I know what you mean about having a special cat that you totally love. I had a small 5 pound cat when I was single that was definitely my cat and I was her person. I still miss her.
aww,fgos7xm,t1_fgorin0,1580984049.0,Did you keep the runt? How is she as an adult?
aww,fgos69c,t3_ezq0tz,1580983985.0,"The kitten on the left is a Maine coon, too, while the kitten on the right had a different dad. They’re about four years old now and still quite different in size. Anubis is almost 20 pounds while Lilith is 12 pounds."
Ceramics,fgoq96y,t1_fgocgo4,1580981244.0,And thanks! Three years on Reddit. It’s very addicting with so many interesting reads.
Ceramics,fgoq43u,t1_fgocgo4,1580981041.0,I’ve used Duncan crystalline glazes but this is beyond that. Do you use a gas kiln or does that not make a difference?
MadeMeSmile,fgo4cwo,t1_fgo3zo2,1580959487.0,Now if only we had cake for these two adorable children!
Floof,fgo46xc,t1_fgo3sgz,1580959377.0,I just wish we actually got cake. :)
adorableoldpeople,fgo3tde,t3_ezkt20,1580959127.0,He looks wonderful. So hard to go through though for him and all the family.
Ceramics,fgo2fx1,t3_ezftua,1580958210.0,Is it a custom glaze?
Ceramics,fgo1fyg,t3_ezcmey,1580957585.0,Very nicely done.
MadeMeSmile,fgo0g2s,t1_fgmkv6f,1580956944.0,"They’re wonderful! Do you have other children, too?"
MadeMeSmile,fgo09u3,t1_fgnuflh,1580956833.0,Happy cake day!
Floof,fgnz186,t3_ezemct,1580956040.0,"I have four cats that take turns on my lap while
I’m drinking my coffee in the morning and doing my digital jigsaw puzzle. Best part of the day!"
Floof,fgnyvpq,t1_fgn6yvv,1580955942.0,"It’s your cake day, too! Happy cake day!"
Catsmirin,fgnyeqa,t1_fgnnyv8,1580955634.0,Run. Run far and fast!
ferrets,fgno7se,t1_fgmch1v,1580949205.0,"I’m sorry about your ferret that was terminally ill. So hard to go through, especially with such big changes happening."
Catsmirin,fgnnr85,t3_eze7b0,1580948901.0,You need to see if there’s a slight smile or a big smile. Slight or no smile and you’re in trouble!
Gary_The_Cat,fgmr802,t3_eza0rn,1580930410.0,I love how the pose is the same as his ID tag.
Gary_The_Cat,fgjd531,t3_eyqhjg,1580841550.0,"Wow! Gary’s only a few shy of 25,000 followers. Woohoo!! Let’s get the last nine and put him over that total!"
Gary_The_Cat,fgjcw4n,t3_eyqhjg,1580841405.0,"“My adoring public need me.” Gary, probably."
Gary_The_Cat,fgfu1h0,t3_ey7jbb,1580747600.0,"The reflected light off the snow onto Gary is gorgeous! Beautiful photo as usual! “Did you get my good side?” Gary, probably."
Gary_The_Cat,fgeoqs7,t3_expuhe,1580705057.0,Cold pink nose!
Gary_The_Cat,fg6uvfl,t3_ex7wnp,1580577416.0,I’m sure the shoulder rides are great for Gary (as it should be) but I can see that it would be fatiguing over time for mom or dad. Do you trade off? Does Gary have a preference riding draped across the back or more from the front?
ScienceLaboratory,fg5ma5g,t1_fg5lbtx,1580531421.0,Sounds like this little guy might not be in too good a shape afterwards then. Thanks for the info.
Gary_The_Cat,fg3xfm6,t3_ewox95,1580491730.0,Got it. Thank you. Not too many glaciers in Louisiana.
teefies,fg3xbse,t3_ewpgoj,1580491664.0,Doesn’t he look like the perfect character for in a cartoon about cats and their effort to take over the world?
KittyPupperLove,fg3wnmk,t3_ewpbkx,1580491259.0,Now he just needs to watch out for the claw in the eye! Just keep them shut!
Gary_The_Cat,fg3uuki,t3_ewox95,1580490157.0,"Can Gary educate me, please? Is the glacier the ice lake that’s in the background? Or is he standing on it?"
Gary_The_Cat,fg2fxy8,t1_fg2eqyi,1580444255.0,Still your best group shot yet!
Gary_The_Cat,fg2aumd,t3_ew5sx1,1580441587.0,Interesting. The dogs have their chins up looking more upwards but Gary knows to look straight at the camera.
ALLTHEANIMALS,fg2acga,t1_ffzocwm,1580441335.0,I’m not sure why you downvoted me. I didn’t ask in a mean way. That picture really isn’t very clear about what’s going on. Wouldn’t you rather a person who cares about animals but doesn’t want to make an assumption that might be incorrect?
ALLTHEANIMALS,fg2a182,t3_evtm9h,1580441175.0,I can’t quite tell. Is the puppy grabbing the strap then with a tooth I can’t see?
awesome,ffzfwe6,t3_evqn7b,1580377048.0,"As a parent, this made me cringe. Strong kid but so dangerous!"
ALLTHEANIMALS,ffyp0ph,t3_evtm9h,1580351658.0,It looks like the puppy is being yanked against his will. Am I wrong?
Gary_The_Cat,ffyisob,t1_ffxcfya,1580347429.0,Ha! Good one!
DivorcedBirds,ffxcd0n,t3_evo8rg,1580322253.0,“You bought what?! Without asking me?!” Hank probably since he looks like a Hank.
Gary_The_Cat,ffx90qc,t3_evn9h8,1580320268.0,All those bubbles look like they’re radiating out from Gary. The Ice Master has the power!
Gary_The_Cat,ffx8qa3,t3_evn9h8,1580320095.0,Wow! Great photo! I watched a YouTube where someone in Russia used an ice pick or something to release the methane and a cigarette lighter to catch it on fire. Have you ever done that? Is it as dangerous as it seems it might be?
100yearsago,ffwmt65,t3_evk4l8,1580305778.0,Thanks for sharing.
seniorkitties,ffwmkqm,t3_evl5e4,1580305595.0,25 is amazing! Obviously she’s had an excellent home to live so long.
ScienceLaboratory,ffwjhg9,t1_ffusta0,1580303021.0,Right. Ok! Where are the jellyfishologists out there? Inquiring minds need to know!
curledfeetsies,ffujcql,t3_ev4zo0,1580243183.0,"I love it, too!"
specialaww,ffu8h80,t3_ev8qnk,1580236700.0,Heterochromia!
ScienceLaboratory,ffu86xf,t3_ev5m4m,1580236529.0,I wonder if jellyfish have the ability to get vertigo or nausea.
Mensmittenwithkittens,fftno0n,t1_fftfd1j,1580225104.0,Now I see why the eyes are so striking. It’s that dark line around the light iris. Cool! And I love your title by your name. :)
Gary_The_Cat,fftndns,t3_ev5zie,1580224913.0,Oooo! Are those methane bubbles under Gary? And isn’t that wind cold? I’d buy a Gary Dylan version of this song any day.
Mensmittenwithkittens,fftclbx,t3_euyzh0,1580216480.0,What beautiful eyes on your cat!
dogswithjobs,fftc6p2,t1_fft9jyl,1580216094.0,Loved the poem! Keep it up!
PetAfterVet,fftavlo,t3_euzqn7,1580214828.0,The vet must have felt badly. What kind of surgery did he have?
straightenedfeetsies,ffsitns,t3_euvz0j,1580182743.0,Your cat almost looks like he or she has a fox shaped head. Very unique and elegant.
TheCuddlePuddle,ffsf7z5,t1_ffryxdb,1580180245.0,I think you’re right. Thanks.
TheCuddlePuddle,ffrkh6t,t3_eutmya,1580159881.0,Are the two smaller ones facing the front door to know as soon as she comes home?
Sculpture,ffrdkrz,t3_eumsev,1580155888.0,"Very clever! Nice way to get that wintery look. So, do you do ice sculptures for special events? For photography purposes after the sculpting is done? Or just for personal satisfaction? I can see it being a great way to express yourself. What do you do with the sculptures afterwards?"
Gary_The_Cat,ffqueh9,t1_ffqsm3i,1580143867.0,Aw poor sweet Marge. Baby steps. Maybe with time.
Sculpture,ffqt9ym,t3_eumsev,1580143137.0,Ok! Last question! How did you get the ice crystals after carving? They really add to the look. Did you just leave it in a freezer for a while or did you mist it after carving?
Sculpture,ffqt41b,t3_eumsev,1580143028.0,Forgot to mention that this is very nicely done. You definitely know facial anatomy.
Sculpture,ffqt1bk,t3_eumsev,1580142978.0,How hard was it to chip off ice without a chunk coming off that caused instant regret? Would a dremel work better?
Gary_The_Cat,ffqsa83,t1_ffqn2gx,1580142480.0,Was this in the car after a nice long hike?
Gary_The_Cat,ffqs6y2,t3_euojx0,1580142419.0,"Actually, Marge is doing really well considering Gary is a cat. She didn’t receive a whack on the nose. There’s hope, Marge! There’s hope! Give it time."
CatsAndDogsBFF,ffpmtil,t3_euhqkp,1580098997.0,So sorry for your loss. Hard to lose a pet.
Gary_The_Cat,ffoweg2,t1_ffn6ys8,1580082580.0,He doesn’t really like wearing them.
Gary_The_Cat,ffip8bu,t3_ets3ku,1579979298.0,Tough to beat pictures of Gary. Except with more pictures of Gary.
specialaww,ffhag3w,t1_ffh9d9l,1579927872.0,Do they do the same thing for humans with glaucoma?
curledfeetsies,ffgjm61,t1_ffex9pg,1579907741.0,Does that also include Egyptian cats?
curledfeetsies,ffgjeae,t1_ffeocr8,1579907600.0,"For some reason, she looks Egyptian to me. Based on the Egyptian cat art!"
specialaww,ffgj93a,t1_ffea9at,1579907504.0,Thank heavens for people who stick up for animals! That’s funny about Gordy not being a dachshund but getting support as a dachshund mix.
specialaww,ffgj06y,t1_ffeacvx,1579907341.0,"I can believe that. Our pets are part of our family. Luckily, our pets usually deal with it better than we do!"
Mensmittenwithkittens,fffgy61,t3_et2eai,1579883730.0,I can see the cat offering gaming advice. “You should have taken a left there instead of a right.”
interesting,fffgm5o,t3_etadgr,1579883522.0,Happy little faces! Bob Ross would be so pleased.
Sculpture,fffgjg0,t3_eta1ws,1579883476.0,Nice work! Did you use a metal support structure especially for the wings?
Gary_The_Cat,fffgcar,t3_etatns,1579883353.0,"Nice title! Of course, working with such a fantastic model must make it pretty easy to be inspired."
curledfeetsies,ffe5gmu,t3_esydur,1579837199.0,What type of kitty is your cat? Very unique!
specialaww,ffckyo8,t1_ffbq9r5,1579801672.0,"So she’ll for sure get glaucoma in her other eye eventually? It must have been heartbreaking when you first got the diagnosis. And what happened to Gordy to make him a tripod (or as you cleverly put it, a tripawd)?"
specialaww,ffb99ds,t3_esdste,1579755857.0,Another question if you don’t mind. Her right eye looks fine (which I know can be deceptive). Is there a point you can hold off to so the dog has use of the eye for as long as possible?
specialaww,ffb950i,t3_esdste,1579755722.0,Sweet fur babies btw.
specialaww,ffb94ki,t3_esdste,1579755708.0,What happens to a dog with glaucoma if the eyeball isn’t removed?
Gary_The_Cat,ff500p6,t1_ff395v6,1579576598.0,Just as well. I’m sure Gary needed the recovery time. But we do love the pictures so thank you for posting something to keep us happy. You’re the best!
ScienceLaboratory,ff383z7,t3_er9b9i,1579535931.0,I assume this was footage taken by a drone? Sure makes it easier to get some spectacular views!
Gary_The_Cat,ff37zcv,t3_erdlw0,1579535846.0,Gary finally made it back out again? Or is a past photo to keep his admiring fans happy?
Catsmirin,feq6vgv,t3_eq8bdq,1579338365.0,He’s beautiful!
CalicoKittys,feq41is,t3_eq41n4,1579337400.0,Welcome Myla!
Pottery,fenul1s,t3_eq2dwy,1579291022.0,Great idea! I’d even let people take them home.
Gary_The_Cat,fen5h63,t1_fen0k33,1579277403.0,"Good luck, Gary! Clean teeth are
important when you’re a celebrity!"
Gary_The_Cat,fejwswc,t3_epk2l5,1579187650.0,Is there room for me by Gary at that fire? Looks so inviting!
Gary_The_Cat,fehy1iy,t3_ep3216,1579126150.0,"“Squirrel!” - Gary, probably"
Pet_Renaissance,fefmcmi,t3_eoorer,1579059427.0,"Nice title, too."
Gary_The_Cat,fefghgj,t1_feduyer,1579055822.0,You’re making me shudder.
Gary_The_Cat,fedu2vb,t1_fedrso9,1579019908.0,You guys! Waaaay too cold! -24 degrees for us Americans!
Gary_The_Cat,fedtqg6,t1_fedi8vv,1579019699.0,I’d say you have an instinctive feel for excellent composition then because you follow a lot of the rules for good photography.
Pet_Renaissance,fe073iu,t3_en84ba,1578804779.0,Nice!
Gary_The_Cat,fe06k13,t3_en83fn,1578804341.0,"Gary looks different without his coat on! The man made one, of course!"
Gary_The_Cat,fdql59c,t3_emrcq4,1578669297.0,I’m not fond of cold even though as a child as soon as it was 40 degrees Fahrenheit I’d run around barefoot outside. What I can’t take anymore is it getting dark around 4 pm (if the day was cloudy). Going to work in the dark and coming home in the dark was not fun. At least you get outside regularly with Gary so you get sunshine. A lot of people hole up and hibernate in the winter.
Gary_The_Cat,fdoiqya,t1_fdnjx6o,1578605969.0,I like your word choice. Wrangling sounds perfect. :)
Sculpture,fdnj6u8,t3_embejh,1578586924.0,Clever!
Gary_The_Cat,fdniwzi,t1_fdng89t,1578586763.0,Does Gary ever ride on the shoulders of your SO?
Gary_The_Cat,fdk5ctr,t3_elt66u,1578496430.0,I think the cold intensifies the pink of his adorable nose.
