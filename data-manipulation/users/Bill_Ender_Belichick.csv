nfl,ffk4g8n,t1_ffjno0g,1580015536.0,"I think they weren’t necessarily trying to list the best (as in most talented) players ever, otherwise it’d be dominated by more modern players (Derrick Henry would be the undeniable GOAT if he played 50 years ago). They tried to give players from every era to showcase the entirety of NFL history. Not saying there weren’t some questionable choices (Regis should’ve been on there) but not having all the most talented players doesn’t mean the lost is wrong."

GreenBayPackers,ffjs422,t1_ffihphm,1580005446.0,"I say draft for need this year and start looking for a possible successor next year. We have a good core but need help at ILB, DT, and WR (OT depth would be nice too).

nba,ffjp2q3,t1_ffjmeae,1580003407.0,I still think he could wind up being better than Luka. Let’s wait 4 years and then re-evaluate; Giannis is arguably the best player in the league right now and he was a total unknown when he was drafted. Bagley might make a similar improvement over several years.
nfl,ffjnwxs,t3_etqyg8,1580002618.0,Yeah but the last two teams to beat us in the NFCCG lost in dramatic fashion so it’s over.

todayilearned,ffiuc68,t1_ffihkjw,1579982928.0,"Yeah football has probably the highest “entry difficulty” of any of the major pro sports. Basketball is easy to understand, ball goes into hoop, points (in its fundamental form). Football has a fuckton of things going on every play that directly contribute to whether the play is successful or not; it’s almost impossible to fully appreciate a good play without seeing 4 different replays.
