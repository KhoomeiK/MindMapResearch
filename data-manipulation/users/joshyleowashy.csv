politics,fffader,t1_fff949k,1579879586.0,"I’ll try and expand on the other commenter’s question. Why should that sport and industry in general earn billions of dollars? Same as the other person, I already understand how and even why. But why should it?"
Political_Revolution,ff3lnor,t1_ff3lagb,1579543690.0,"So now that you get proven wrong you just go ahead and move the goalpost from “He’s never been a mayor” to “Okay sure he was a mayor but still doesn’t count”. My man, do you realize how ridiculous that is? You are really trying hard to hate this man."
Political_Revolution,ff3l8bb,t1_ff3gsgy,1579543426.0,You are so full of shit lmao he was literally the mayor of Burlington between 1981 and 1989. Jesus the hate boner people have for Bernie is insane.
todayilearned,fdyzsux,t1_fdyz5cq,1578785281.0,"I mean i’m a single dude living in an area with lower than average cost of living in the US making minimum wage for my state, so 50k with some of those perks (we can at least safety assume that paid travel, being Snoops friend, and having something cool to put on your resume are assured) would be worth it for ME. Of course I can’t speak for everyone."
todayilearned,fdyxsfn,t1_fdyx1hc,1578784661.0,"If rent, food, weed, travel expenses, free merch, chance to be friends with Snoop Dogg, and the connections that’d give you in the industry are all part of that package, then hell yeah i will roll up some weed from the start of my day till the end for $10 an hour. Emphasis on “If.”"
todayilearned,fdykobw,t1_fdyjafk,1578780793.0,"Without context of the situation, of which plenty exists in this thread, this sounds pretty shitty. But everything taken into consideration, working a job like this for, say, 5 years, could have you pretty set if you’re smart with your finances."
YouShouldKnow,fdmg8jt,t1_fdmeqej,1578548861.0,I too enjoy going blind in the process of getting drunk.
