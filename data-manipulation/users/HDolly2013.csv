Neverwinter,ffulijw,t3_evb8io,1580244488.0,"If that is the power dealing with draining soul sparks, I go against popular opinion and use the one that doesn't have a cooldown. I don't like not being able to quickly gain sparks whenever I need. I also main a DC so I am used to channeling divinity and this is sort of similar lol. If you have any retraining tokens consider trying both and see which you prefer. If you are just now unlocking this feat though it might be better to wait until you're closer to end game to decide"
aww,ffpdaxj,t3_eubdfp,1580092183.0,I absolutely love this because I also have a derpy blue point Siamese!
Neverwinter,ffp31pw,t1_ffp2uxw,1580085247.0,What does it do?
Neverwinter,ffos4su,t3_eu5wzg,1580080978.0,I used this enchantment for about a week then gave up. I never noticed it proc even once but I could be wrong
Neverwinter,fforeq2,t3_euacrq,1580080830.0,"Lingering Sustain is worthless imo. Life Bind is great but can be overwhelming especially in a party with no tank. Makes doing all DPS LoMM runs a nightmare. I have yet to survive Trobriand's blast since switching to Life Bind lol but so far that hasn't been a problem. Recently started using the negation armor enchantment and it seems to help a little, I will switch to a high level shadowclad when I can afford it as I imagine it will work even better."
Neverwinter,ffk2eaz,t3_eu1hp8,1580013700.0,If you're in a guild maybe it's time to find one that has a more active alliance
Neverwinter,ffh26bc,t1_ffg5f7g,1579921098.0,For questing use the DPS path but the healing path is a lot of fun and viable in dungeons after you have put a decent bit of time/AD into it.
weed,ff7tjj5,t1_ff7ta4w,1579658011.0,"Can't say I got anything astronomy related from a post about sativa. If it's supposed to be about an episode of Big Bang Theory, my bad. Haven't really watched it to understand. But yeah, people should be aware of that lol. Agreed on this generation, along with every generation, being fucked!"
weed,ff7t54e,t1_ff7i65i,1579657729.0,What exactly was the science comment?
weed,ff790ft,t1_ff776z9,1579643574.0,"Completely agree with this. I did it heavy for almost 2 years, now I do it once every few months. It is a stupid and evil drug and I beg people to not go down that road if they haven't already. At this point when I do it I like it less and less. I just cut off ties with the person who could get it for me so this may be it for me. The worst it's done to me is it turned my anger up x10. I've almost been arrested a few times and almost got expelled from college. Weed is the only thing that can calm me down now days but it is getting better"
weed,ff74g5t,t1_ff6wwr2,1579640924.0,My thought exactly! That's the only time I've had similar experiences lol
dragonage,ff4khk2,t3_er4e0f,1579565803.0,"Definitely Origins! I still to this day haven't finished Inquisition but I've finished Origins several, several times"
aww,feoy0z8,t1_fem1c4o,1579307851.0,"Thank you, much appreciated!"
Neverwinter,feoxzhj,t1_feojf4u,1579307826.0,"Completely agree. I started playing about 4 months ago and haven't played much else since then, but here lately it has been making me feel angry and/or depressed. Definitely take a break and play something preferably from a different genre"
Neverwinter,fely9qe,t3_eptme4,1579234011.0,Companion gear and rings
Neverwinter,fely7aa,t3_epubuq,1579233958.0,Does this only happen with Magic Missle? I don't play this class but if it has a longer cast time that could make it look like lag.
aww,felxvp1,t1_felpysf,1579233710.0,This is worded so beautifully! I'm in a completely different situation but I have been feeling that I am undeserving of things. I feel super guilty about things that I usually don't have a reason for being guilty. Hope these words bring light to many others!
Neverwinter,fej91x5,t1_feisak1,1579162183.0,So how much does HA actually heal for at your enchantment level and HP? How much does lifedrinker heal for? I can't seem to notice it proc
Showerthoughts,fej8roj,t3_epbose,1579161801.0,Yup welcome to America!
Neverwinter,fegvixn,t1_fegv6sp,1579103476.0,It also bothers me that almost no one bothers to move out of the clearly marked circle lol
Neverwinter,fee5j62,t1_fed1oaw,1579026831.0,Offense slot
cats,fedz8pj,t3_eok2wv,1579023012.0,God bless you for saving this beautiful kitty!
