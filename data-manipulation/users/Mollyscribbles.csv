For cheap weapons, if you want to one-shot, try the Corrosive Spear Wand and Multi Barbed Ice Spear.  Affordable, but they do way more damage than the Scroll of Ultranova.

konmari,fcyx724,t3_ejme40,1578089053.0,"If it sparks joy, it sparks joy.  Maybe find a way of repurposing it? Hard to really advise on what direction to take without a better idea of what it looks like."
neopets,fcyx15l,t3_ejm5s4,1578088949.0,"I refresh the sw 3-4 times and set the price at the 5th lowest price of those listed.  Sometimes there'll be someone who's set the price several thousand below the standard asking price for quick NP, and using that as your price point just means you'll be losing in the long term even if your till fills faster."
neopets,fcys9c8,t3_ejlrqc,1578085983.0,"Which one are you talking about? Most face paints just add a design to the faces rather than changing the entire pet, though some of the body paints have the effect you're describing."
konmari,fcvxt37,t3_ej6ff4,1578012541.0,"I am of the opinion that decanting is for people who like the aesthetic; otherwise, it seems like a bad idea -- if someone asks you if \[x\] contains something they're allergic to and you've tossed the packaging, it could cause problems."

neopets,fcrgobn,t3_eig7d3,1577901588.0,"If it changes the pet visually, it'd actually result in less customization because most of the wearables wouldn't fit it anymore and TNT isn't about to go back and make old items wearable."
neopets,fcos1ih,t1_fcopntr,1577840004.0,"oooh yeah, that's the frustrating part.  I ended up starting on gourmet feeding simply to have options that are actually buyable -- once you get down to the last 400 books, it's a lot harder to get anything."

What I really wish is that they'd change the trophy to be like the Avatar highscore, where you only get on the list if you've increased your score in the past month."

If he handles visits with the relatives better than he handled the Disney trip before, it'll probably result in a happier week for everyone involved for him to have a quiet vacation with them.  Disney will be there for him to enjoy when he's old enough to enjoy it."

If you wanted to play up the vegetable side of things, maybe the Fancy Kitchen Background and Basket of Vegetables for a daring escape; the Cornucopia bg/fg for peacefully chilling with other veggies; the Super Pea Chia Cape and the Hero of Neopia Background if you want to make it into a Super Attack Pea."
