Immediately after adding the new disk, sdd and sdc were full and sde was empty.  Your metadata was probably at 98% back then too.  At that point, you had somewhere to write data but nowhere to write metadata.  Writing metadata required raid1 to allocate a new metadata block on at least two different disks, but you had no space on 2 of your 3 disks so it could only allocate on one.

So, what you needed was at least a partial balance.  Even rebalancing only 5-10 1GB blocks would probably have bought you enough space for metadata to expand for a decent while.

networking,fep36k4,t1_feovz3a,1579311102.0,"VDCs aren't really useful when you're talking about how many hundreds of customers you can put on a single switch.  VRFs are more for routing, and generally a managed hosting provider tends to have little need to route customer networks around.  There were occasional needs, but for the most part customer networks lived entirely within our own building.  So, lots of VLANs and huge layer 2 networks.  Not so much layer 3 until you get outside the customer solution, at which point there's a fairly normal datacenter backbone.

This was maybe 2003-2005 that I was setting up PVLANs and moving customers to them, and maybe 2010-ish that we had switched over to putting new customers on VLANs behind real firewalls instead.

I don't know about any lack of support.  It was certainly well supported on the Cisco 6500 and Nexus platforms.  The Nexus added some nice features like ""switchport mode private-vlan trunk secondary"" allowing me to set up tagged ports facing hosts but with PVLAN behavior on one of the VLANs.  That way the PVLAN looked like a normal VLAN to the hosts and not the 2+ VLANs that PVLANs are normally trunked as.

In general it was pretty common to have little or no segmentation between customers for a long time.  A new server might come with 10 IPs out of a /24 on the same VLAN as the next customer who has the next 10 IPs.  Remember that the PVLAN feature I used actually restored full L3 connectivity between all customers.  My goal was not to block L3 connectivity, but to protect the L2 network against faults (usually from dumb configs).  When the users have admin/root access to their servers, they are prone to doing things like typing the gateway into the IP field and taking down the entire /24.  PVLAN deployment was meant to stop the IP conflicts more than anything else.  I would have considered the design broken if any server wasn't able to reach any other server.  PVLAN without local proxy-arp wasn't really an option because then customers couldn't reach each other.

As we shifted the business to focus on large highly managed customers, there was much more focus on security.  At that point, firewalls (which we managed and customers didn't have access to) had their outside WAN interfaces piled into the shared /24 VLANs, and then the inside interfaces were connected to a VLAN dedicated to a single customer.  Customers who wanted a DMZ would get another firewall interface connected into another VLAN.  So, at this point there was much better segmentation and there were firewalls to decide if customer servers could talk to each other.  But still, if customer A had a public web site opened to the world on their firewall, it was certainly reachable from customer B's servers.

As VMs and then cloud came along, there was a lot of chaos as people tried random architectures.  In the very beginning, we deployed VMs right into the VLANs that were behind firewalls, exactly like physical servers had been deployed.  However, this was largely not automated so it didn't really work out for cloud, which needed to be self-service with immediate deployment.

For a while, it seemed like the future was going to be VMs that weren't behind firewalls and everyone would just depend on iptables or hypervisor firewalls (think AWS security groups).  This was what you got with AWS before VPCs came along.  But then, AWS came out with VPCs, and the trend shifted more toward having your VMs on your own network behind some sort of firewall/NAT appliance that controlled/limited access."

networking,fenqsmr,t3_eq2boi,1579289470.0,"At my previous job, I ran the network at a large managed hosting provider for over a decade, and during that time I migrated them to PVLANs (and then later migrated away from them).

Look at ""ip local-proxy-arp"".  This causes the router to answer ARPs for everything inside the subnet.  The result is that all of the PVLAN hosts are able to communicate with each other - but at level 3 via the default gateway.  Even same-subnet traffic now has an extra hop through the router.

You get the L2 isolation of PVLANs, but retain full L3 connectivity.

* Customers are not able to create an IP conflict with the default gateway at all because they will never hear anyone else's ARPs.
* Customers are somewhat protected against IP conflicts with each other in that ARP renewal requests only go to the host that is already using that IP.  Put simply, a customer IP that is in use can not be conflicted with or stolen, but if that customer ever fails to reply to an ARP refresh then that IP is released from the ARP table.  Entries that are not already in the ARP table are a free-for-all and can be stolen by anyone.
* Customers can talk to each other via L3, just as you'd expect over the Internet.  You don't get any customers from company A complaining that they can't email company B (because company B's mail server is on your network too and PVLANs normally break connectivity).

I was running something like 40 /24 networks on a single PVLAN like this at peak.

The reason we eventually migrated away from PVLANs is that we moved to serving only larger customers.  Our larger customers always had a firewall, and thus always had a dedicated VLAN behind that firewall.  The PVLAN with local proxy-arp model was more suited for the low end ""just a server or two"" customers who didn't bother with a firewall or took care of it with iptables.

For your IPMI question, is this happening on the same NIC as the server's main uplink, or on dedicated IPMI NICs?  We didn't have IPMI, but we did have a backup network.  The backup network consisted of a PVLAN without local proxy-arp, which means that all customer servers were unable to talk to each other at all over this network - exactly what we wanted for backups.

In early years, we had an uplink NIC and a backups NIC on each server.  Later, I migrated from 6500s to Nexus, and at that point I started giving every single server 2 Ethernet cables and doing vPC/MLAG and VLAN tagging by default.  Every server could be put on any VLAN just by adding the tag into the existing cables.  This was great because we no longer had to involve the DC if someone asked for a 3rd VLAN or anything like that.  This also meant we had proper redundancy and I could power off any L2 switch and have sub-second failover.  Customers wouldn't even notice.

This is incorrect (though your post in general is great).  Roaming works just fine on a single channel, though obviously this is not a desirable configuration.

Years ago, before mesh was a thing, I used 4 Linksys WRT54G routers and used WDS to link them all together in a line.  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.  I then deployed this long line of APs with #1 having an Ethernet uplink via LAN port, and all other APs having no network cables at all.

\#1 was parents living room

\#2 was parents garage

\#3 was sister's garage (2 houses away)

\#4 was sister's living room

All APs were on the same channel because this was necessary for single-radio APs to do WDS to each other.  This allowed them to share a single Internet connection and to have a single LAN across 2 houses.  The single-channel many-hop deployment was an inefficient use of wifi spectrum, but their Internet link was only 2 Mbps anyway.  The same-channel deployment did not cause any problems for roaming.  I could start a download near AP #1, walk outside, down the street, into the second house and go near AP #4 and I'd end up roaming to either #3 or #4 without any interruption to my download.

All that said, I'd certainly always recommend putting them on different channels.  The above situation was a special case where I had no choice."

I don't use any enterprise drives at home.  I'm generally looking for cheap and low power storage and don't care much about performance.  So, my numbers are going to be consumer grade, and not even high performance consumer.

btrfs,fdld21o,t1_fdl9ezn,1578521426.0,"The drives are in USB enclosures and connected to the server via USB, so they're not using regular in-server-case power.  Their power is controlled by an APC managed power strip.  The one I have is super old, from like 2000-ish, and it supports turning ports on/off via SNMP.  So, my backup script calls snmpset to turn on the power, sleeps for a minute for everything to start, mounts the disks, does a backup, unmounts the disks, sleeps a minute, then calls snmpset again to turn off the power.

Using USB also means I'm not tying up any precious SATA ports."
btrfs,fdk6dgx,t1_fdk2rnw,1578497103.0,"My backups system is designed to power up the backup drives, perform a backup, and then power them off.  All of the listed btrfs drives spin probably <1 hour per day on average.  While this doesn't completely negate your comment, it is largely mitigated.  However, I do agree there is still some merit to what you're saying.

Your watts estimate is very high though.  It's more like 5-7 watts per hard drive when active.  I keep my server and my desktop on kill-a-watt meters so I have a pretty good idea of their usage.

Up until a few months ago, my entire server with 7 24/7 spinning HDs pulled 70 watts, and about 25 watts of that was the CPU/motherboard/RAM.  I recently replaced 5 of those 7 HDs with 4 SSDs, reducing the power use, but I can't remember the current watts.  I'll check when I get home.  At this point, I only have 2 HDs left at home that spin 24/7.  Everything else has migrated to SSD."

The 111 GiB one is an old PATA drive pulled out of a TiVo that was first installed in like 1999-2000.

I do feel a little stupid and wasteful using RAID1 instead of RAID5/6, but the convenience of btrfs adding/removing disks is so huge that I'm willing to use the 50% inefficient storage method.  Generally, my arrays either have a small number of disks, so 50% inefficiency isn't much worse than RAID5/6 would be, or my arrays have quite a few disks, making RAID1 much less efficient with space but also making the convenience of add/remove so much more important."

If you're running it along an easy to replace path, this is fine.  However, if you're installing it inside walls or in any way that makes it hard to upgrade in the future, I'd suggest using a newer cable standard.  Not because you need it now, but so you don't have to rip things out 5 years from now when you want 10Gbps.

I have 2 podcast episodes, from different podcasts, both from December 27th, whose status was stuck as ""Waiting for WiFi"".  Never mind that I'm on WiFi 95% of the time and it has been over a week, and newer podcasts have downloaded just fine.  I have disconnected and reconnected WiFi, rebooted, and even disabled the setting that requires WiFi for downloads, allowing my podcasts to be downloaded over mobile data, and still the status is still always ""waiting for WiFi"".  Pressing the little X on the episode, which should cancel the download, does nothing.

I eventually found the button for ""cancel all downloads"" in settings.  Hitting that changed the status of the waiting downloads to look like un-downloaded episodes.  At first I thought this was going to be a fix, however now clicking the download button on the episodes does nothing.  Both of these podcasts will immediately play just fine if I hit the play button for them to stream.  This sounds somewhat similar to the state you ended up in, however one big difference from what you describe is that I don't even get a momentary download indicator.
