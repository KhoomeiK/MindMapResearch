ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fesdbou,t1_ferwumm,1579364077.0,This is literally impossible to parse for me. How can you be far left and think that capitalism is sustainable in any possible way?
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fesca9t,t1_fesaq6r,1579363798.0,"It’s a false equivalency, the other three are criticizing the validity of the current economic model, while top right is plainly about human rights. While I personally think those tie completely into one another and can all be solved with this abolition of capital, this is not a “normal” take for the general populous. Therefore this is a fucked up equivalency and shows how far to the (authoritarian) right the “center” has shifted."

bitters,fde8pki,t3_ekxaiy,1578333631.0,"Dash! As a bartender, for consistency’s sake, me and all my bartenders know what a dash is, size wise, but when you get into droppers you’re have to build into your recipe either “drops” or “30% of your dropper”. Idk, this might be petty and stupid and no one else might have this problem but I am just so sick of droppers for this reason.. also it helps for speed to be able to dash rather than have to pull out a dropper. Just my 2¢."
Distilling,fdbjzgw,t1_fda3gaj,1578258126.0,Why is absinthe almost always so incredibly sweet then? I thought that there must be some step involving an addition of sugar cos that’s mind blowing that it can be so high abv and so sweet at the same time.
Distilling,fd6ky2r,t3_ek65cf,1578192550.0,"My advice... just do it. See what happens. If you need to bitter it up you can probably order common wormwood online and get gentian, chinchona, etc. as well.


I believe that absinthe is a sugared tincture rather than actually distilled using a wormwood-based mash. In fact, I’m willing to bet dollars to donuts that it’s like the gin extraction method where you redistill your initial neutral grain with the botanicals to extract the flavors+herbal compounds."
