I played with it for a while, amazed by the mechanics of it and how fluidly it all moved. It was really weird and cool, as I've never heard about this type of typewriter and it felt so alien to me.

On a side note, even that was enough to cause minor abuse from employees. People intentionally dropping boxes of really nice ice cream ""on accident"" so it got transfered to the bin by the break room was a common occurence. Our managers didn't care much though, the losses were still miniscule (how much fucking ice cream can you eat?) and it kept the morale up, as people felt they are ""getting theirs"" at the cost of their employer.

At my last job, everybody who worked more than a yeae and learned how we get stiffed, was repeating the holy mantra ""minimum wage, minimum effort"" daily.

It was a technical job, but low level, I was working while finishing up my Master's. New hires got better salaries than I had after two years' experience and yearly raises. The management promised me a promotion as soon as I got my degree (relevant to the field), but then a month before I was done they tell me I'd be paid just slightly more than at my old position - which didn't require any education. I quit on the spot just to spite them, then spent half of my two months notice on vacation as I had some days left.

I then was unemployed for a month, living off my savings, but I'd rather eat myself into the red than be insulted like that. During that time I got snatched up by a recruiter from another company in the same field, and they proposed me an actually sensible salary. Been working there since, absolutely amazing job, so I guess there was a happy ending.

3Dprinting,fe2h9mg,t3_eiewav,1578838355.0,"I am looking to upgrade my Anet A8. I have stock parts only, and now it is out of comission as well - it's been working *fine* but I took it apart a few days ago for cleaning and oiling (the Z-axis rods started squeaking) and one of the ball bearing fell apart. So, at the very least I'd need new ball bearings, but I figured I might as well mod the entire thing.

Now, big problem is I live in Sweden, and import taxes are killing me - every package gets taxed at least 75SEK (about $8 USD) PLUS 25% of the value. This means that buying small parts separately from other countries is a PITA - if I buy some small part for $5, I'll be slapped with something like $10 in tax on top of the price, not to mention shipping.

So, I would either need to find something in Sweden (pretty damn difficult) or order everything to be sent as one package, to minimize the tax and shipping costs.

Now what I'm looking into is to upgrade the frame (AM8 style), get the good MOSFETs (nothing has burned so far but I'm done pushing my luck), better ball bearings, maybe also replace the LCD screen as my current one has gone to shit. Any other cool upgrades such as leveling sensors and something to help with calibration (especially Z-axis which requires recalibration every second print) would be great as well. Open to recommendations for the less obvious stuff too.

Any ideas? :)"

We chatted a bit afterwards and hell yeah Sweden's got some rules.

On a side note, if you live in Sweden and want to try out shooting, go to a proper hunting range rather than a city shooting range. Hunting ranges are about 10% of the price - I paid 60SEK (equivalent of about $5) for 12 shotgun shells. I did pretty good as well, my very first round I got 4/12 clay targets, then rounds 2 and 3 saw a consistent 9/12. Never held anything beside a BB gun in my hands before, so I'm quite proud of myself. Also, people there are extremely friendly.

Skipping all the bad stuff, because hey I can handwave it - I absolutely love the fact that Joe is not your cookie cutter ""perfect psycho"" usually shown on TV. He can be calculating, cold and manipulative, but often lets his emotions get the better of him, fucking up his plans. It feels like most of the leads people got on him were because of him panicking, acting in the heat of the moment or simply not realizing he's leaving tracks. So many murderers on TV (and in movies) are perfect and emotionless, but Joe feels way more real due to those faults.

Also, I've seen the discussions about him not being a great anti-hero, because the things he does are SO horrible - and yeah, they are. But I was still rooting for him for the entirety of this season, hoping he gets rid of Candace somehow. It was so easy to buy into his narrative in the series, it's uncanny - even though I was internally grunting at lines like ""Beck was not the one. But now I know love, Love"" from his internal monologue. Him already finding a new object of obsession at the end was spot on, that's the Joe I know."

Ammo was not a problem, as there are countless manufacturing stations everywhere and I was swimming in resources, ditto for neuromods - I maxed out the human skill trees, but haven't touched alien ones because I'm daddy's little achievement whore. In any case, packrat me was swimming in ammo and consumables.

Weird difficulty scaling was indeed a problem, I think a big problem here was small enemy variety. The hardest fight for me was the huge alien-possessed robot in neuromod division, but it was also the most fun. It was the first time I stumbled upon that type of enemy, I was severely underpowered and had to cheese the fight and use the environment a bunch. Later on, when a single enemy does fuck-all, you are just swarmed and it gets boring. I played on whatever medium was called as I almost never choose the hardest difficulty for my first playthrough.
