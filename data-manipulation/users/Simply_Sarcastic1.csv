AskEngineers,fggzk65,t3_ey9l5o,1580773144.0,"I’ll start by saying that I think what drives most engineers is the desire to solve problems, big or small. The feeling of contributing to society and making sense of the world around you (or your industry). 

If you didn’t know what to do entering into college, I think engineering is still a great path in the sense that the degree does a lot more for you than just allow you to work as an engineer. Exposure to technology and real world issues is huge; but the development of analytical thinking and problem solving is what really transcends engineering as a discipline. You can apply those skills in almost any industry and achieve success.

If you don’t find enjoyment working as an engineer, don’t torture yourself by trying to conform to it. The best advice I can give you is to use some of those analytical skill you undoubtedly developed and think about what kind of activities you are passionate about (teaching, baking, socializing etc) and find a way to make that activity your job. Almost nobody will look at your engineering degree as a negative.

I truly wish you luck and hope you find something  in something you are passionate about.

A good way to get into any general, mechanical engineering is to do small robotics and arduino projects. There are a lot of build kits online. the programming, although basic, would probably be on you but learning about different mechanisms and assembling was a lot of fun for me when i was young."

politics,feejt65,t1_fee87rg,1579035191.0,"Debt is taken out to go to school to contribute to society and economy. Debt is held by government, more likely than not against individuals who need that money for other things (food, shelter, transportation, etc). Debt is cancelled by government, people use money to to contribute to economy. I don’t see why this is detrimental to anybody, especially the government who’d collect the money in taxes regardless.

Ps. This would probably stimulate the economy more than any bank/automaker bailout, why do they deserve a clean slate for shitty business practices?"
