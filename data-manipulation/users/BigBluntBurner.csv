news,ffzajtu,t1_ffyze73,1580369692.0,Nahh I'll believe that when people start shooting up shit that matters instead of taking innocent lives. Shoot up congress or the EPA HQ or some corporate HQ
JusticeServed,ffxmsot,t1_ffxa6c2,1580328314.0,His arm is already like 1/2 of this dude
unpopularopinion,ffxarft,t1_ffx6jut,1580321309.0,"Guess what, most of us dont run around with smelly cocks as well.

Foreskin normally doesnt smell like anything and in case you're not aware it retracts during erection.

I also couldnt give two fucks what women think about this issue. When they're in your pants already noone is going to reject you over being uncircumcised 

Your analogy is incredibly retarded because the appendix actually, just like foreskin, serves a purpose."
unpopularopinion,ffx47u6,t1_ffx0qig,1580317397.0,"Yeah I'll take my experiences and a page that sourced all of their shit over some redditor claiming otherwise.

I dont think it's hard to see how removing tissue with nerve endings as well as exposing the head to influences like drying out or friction permanently has to have some impact.

Also tell me how it would be more ""hygenic""? Most people in the western world have a working shower in their home and use it on a daily basis"
PublicFreakout,ffwm6hu,t1_ffwcjww,1580305277.0,"Kinda wish they wouldve beaten them, encircle and then get their sticks and go to town"
unpopularopinion,ffwlvd2,t1_ffwku5l,1580305027.0,"But having a career doesnt make you any of that.

I've got a stem degree and have been relatively successful at work but I have no ambition for my work and hate every second of it by now. My values are fuck you, pay me on time basically regarding work."
unpopularopinion,ffwgbkh,t1_ffwf61h,1580299990.0,"You're aware that the cartels already operate across America everywhere?

They dont even need to go full Mexico here, why would they. They have their home base across the border and just squeeze money out of the American society."
unpopularopinion,ffwexy7,t3_evjgv4,1580298447.0,"Casuals ruined gaming 

For everyone whinging online about a game theres 9 people that just picked that shit up at gamestop/target having a blast while getting milked by corporations 


If you want to play games made by people that care about anything but money you pretty much have to leave mainstream gaming behind except a few select titles"
