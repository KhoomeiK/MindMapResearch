truelesbians,ffbwfgb,t3_esnaqu,1579785008.0,"I used Diva cups for a couple years and it was always uncomfortable for me. When you’re on your period, your uterus is already kind of swollen and pressing up against your bladder more, making you feel like you have to pee more often. This cup made that even worse for me. The difficulty of getting it in and out was also a lot. Idk how other women change these in a public restroom, but if I wear one on these things I will need to be horizontal on a bed to attempt to insert it inside me. It’s much bigger and more unwieldy than a tampon. So glad I gave up on that years ago. Disposable pads are my go-to now."
detrans,ffbvkxw,t1_ffbg6oo,1579784227.0,"The difference is our choices. They are still transitioning. Here’s an extremely abbreviated version of what lead me to where I am today: I spent 3 years transitioning, from ages 19 through 21. I came out to everyone at the very beginning. The first 1.5 years was just “living as male” and making sure T was the right choice for me. For the next 1.5 years, I was on T. Due to monetary concerns and difficulty finding a doctor, I was forced to temporarily go off T at this point for what I planned to be 6 months, at which point I would move and be able to access hormones for free. I never planned to detransition. I didn’t realize it at the time, but the further I got into transition, the more dysphoric I was. I wanted to be fully male and no matter what medical measures I took, I knew I would never be fully male; I would always only be a trans man. I had dreams of having keyhole double mastectomy and metoidioplasty. I usually wore a binder and often a packer to help with my dysphoria. I experienced “phantom d**k” very often, and usually in non-sexual situations. Just in everyday life, feeling like there was something between my legs but then was jarred to be reminded that there was not. 

When I went off T, I expected my dysphoria to become exponentially worse. It didn’t. After a few months off, I realized I felt *better* mentally somehow. I started doing meditations that grounded me in my body. One day, I had a bizarre experience of suddenly coming back to myself. It’s very hard to explain in a reddit post. It was a moment of complete radical acceptance for who and what I was physically. It dawned on me that maybe, I could just be me. In the body I was given. This experience was 7 years ago now, and so much has happened in that 7 years. Today, I have experienced absolutely no dysphoria in about 2 or 3 years. Sex is a completely different experience for me - something I never in a million years would have thought I could have when I was trans. My trans years are like another life. I found new ways years ago to deal with my dysphoria other than transition (because I was still dysphoric when I detransitioned - I had just determined that transition brought me no real peace.) To sum up what I did, I addressed co-existing mental health issues and I faced my dysphoria instead of attempting to erase it. I listened to it. I sat with it. Over the years, things improved bit by bit. I would never go back now. 

If I had not been forced to go off T, I may well still be trans. The difference is what I chose to do over the course of years to heal myself instead."
detrans,ffb1zlp,t3_esmt86,1579749784.0,"It sounds like you have a lot of connection to your boobs - the idea of breastfeeding, enjoying sexual touch, liking to be in safe spaces with a tight shirt on. It also sounds like you have a connection to being the lesbian community in a certain way, and to non-male queerness (not wanting to be seen as just a straight guy.) In addition to these things, you express uncertainty and mixed feelings, within yourself and within your trans community - feeling indirect pressure to transition through surgery. All of these things are big red flags. A double mastectomy is a major surgery that can never be undone. I would think you should be 110% sure it is what you want in order to go through with that, and that does not seem to be where you’re at. Your whole post sounds to me like you shouldn’t go through with it. There’s no shame in taking a different route than many people, or to “give up an opportunity” that other people envy. They are not you, and they don’t live in your body. I hope you find peace in whatever decision you make. 

P.S. - have you ever watched a full surgery video of this operation? I don’t suggest this to be jarring or inappropriate, but maybe you should further familiarize yourself with the reality of what it looks like. A lot of people act like this surgery is like “poof! Boobs are magically taken off!” and it’s so much more crude than that."
OnionLovers,ffat63c,t3_esf99a,1579743903.0,I want it try one but I’m afraid the breading to onion ratio would be too high...
detrans,ffasnxe,t3_esacdc,1579743572.0,Do happily transitioned people exist? Obviously. Are they medically any different from me? I don’t think so.

truelesbians,ff99v2j,t3_esdd8c,1579708152.0,"More than a couple people here seem to be overly antagonistic towards trans identified females which bothers me. It makes me feel alienated as a detransitioned woman, which sucks when the more trans-inclusive spaces would kick me out for being a “terf” in their eyes. Both sides can be too extreme. 

If you’re asking whether anyone else has better things to do than to talk shit about trans people, then... *raises hand*"

truelesbians,ff8w7ti,t1_ff8jusp,1579698141.0,I’m detransitioned and it’s really not an accurate characterization to say that I transitioned because I “idolized” men and wanted to fuck them. Wow.
