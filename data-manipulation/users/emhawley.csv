They likely will apply the stint. We are just concerned about ongoing costs every time there is an issue with it. We have returned 3 or 4 times so far since it was done. I am losing track at this point. We've hyper vigilant about keeping it dry (first one got wet..we suspect her water bowl because she makes a damn mess). She's been coned the entire time.  So we still are not sure how this happened."

AskReddit,fevqm9a,t1_fev9knh,1579400331.0,"Thank you. 3 years ago I plateaued after a weight loss journey. I had lost about 60 lbs in 14 or 15 months. Nice and slow. Calorie counting with MFP. Exercise just for overall health. Most of it just walking. In the end I could do a plank for 2 mins. 

When I plateaued I started restricting to 900 calories a day...or purging. A few people in my family passed away around that time. One tragically. Family pulled together but it included a lot of food and drinking. It spiraled into binge eating for a year or more. I gained all of it back in 3 months I think. Terrified my doctor. I've been in therapy and met with a nutritionist. I'm 4'11"" at my highest weight of 215 lbs. 

I struggle with holding myself accountable when the direct impact is my own well being. But I work 40 hrs a week, clean house, care for 4 year old, and I'm enrolled in 3 courses this semester. I'm lazy with meal prep and planning. I have to keep so many balls rolling I think I am intentionally absent minded on the diet side of things. But it's killing me. While pregnant I worked 70 hours a week and took classes. Even then, I would have believed myself to be clearly  lazy - or obviously I wouldn't have been fat. 

Sorry. We'll be here forever if I keep unpacking my self hate and failings."

I walked a mile on the treadmill today...but also ate pizza, wings, and drank beer. I really suck at mindfulness and taking care of myself. Some days...I literally want to lose my body...by throwing myself off a cliff. It's excessive but I can become very hyper aware of the baggage and it suffocates me. I get so emotional. Other times its furthest thing from my mind. But I'm not getting any younger..."

CasualConversation,fee7j2u,t3_eof2dx,1579028012.0,"I work for a college. We have a general area that accommodates faculty, staff, students, prospective students, families, and alumni. From my vantage point I heard in gory detail a student's sexual experiences in outrageous detail. She was purposefully loud and catching attention - one of the staff members more familiar with her came out and said ""save it for your dorm room."" She was offended and made it about free speech and people being PC. I am not a prude by any means but it was annoying. I wasn't looking for a show or entertainment despite her definitely being a clown."
