Among the many other doctor visits I had in 2019, I went to an ortho doc for excruciating pain in my right hip. Diagnosis: moderate arthritis with a prognosis of a joint replacement in 5 years if I didn't get my shit together. My prescription was weight loss and exercise, exercise, exercise. The last thing the doctor said to me was: ""Before you eat something when you're not hungry, I want you to ask yourself, 'Do I want to eat, or do I want to get out of pain?'"" 

YES, the truth hurt. But I desperately needed to hear it. I didn't feel shamed, sad, indignant, defensive, or angry. I knew that if I didn't make some drastic changes, I would end up in a wheelchair and eventually wouldn't even be able to wipe my ass unaided. And I had to face that. My body was at the breaking point.

Today was my 7th day of aquatic exercise. Today was my 7th day of putting down the simple carbs. Today I'm finally beginning to see a glimmer of hope that the second half of my life will be so much happier and fulfilling than the first one. Today I am confident that when I see the doctor again on 2/2, that I will have made significant progress.

Fuck the feefees. Fuck the fatshaming nonsense. Listen fatties, you can't bullshit a bullshitter. Don't give me that shit that you're happy being fat. You're not. Your joints hurt, you can't walk more than a few feet without gasping for breath, you have the energy of a turtle, and at the end of the day when you face yourself in the mirror do you really think you are the best person you can be at this weight? Come on, be honest.
