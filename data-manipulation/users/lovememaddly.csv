dogs,ffaolj8,t1_ffaj9wh,1579740842.0,I have a 4 year old Lhasa who just learned to howl after living with all our families dogs for 6 months. My Yorkie dachshund mix howls on command but Chewie just now figured it out. Maybe they need some influence.
truechildfree,ff6sxzo,t1_ff58y2t,1579634229.0,"That was one of my biggest problems with being the parent, it was never right. Discipline them and you're told they're just kids. Don't, and you get yelled at for not controlling them. And they knew I was the least favorite kid, so they lied about me all the time, and were always believed."
truechildfree,ff6ru21,t3_erlwnq,1579633560.0,"My step-bitch was an obese cow who spent all her time on the couch eating white bread slices and watching tv. I raise my 2 half brother from 7/8 to 15 when step-bitch drove my dad to bankruptcy and ran away to another state. My aunt took me in while my dad ran away to chase her. My mom had 2 daughters she took care of instead of me and my dad had 2 boys. Their kids are the same ages too, it was like they talked about abandoning me and made pregnancy plans together. So ya, I've raised kids and I'm never doing it again."

Edit: I saw a video that said the muscle we can voluntarily use has a function of dampening loud abrupt sounds like lightening but isn't fast enough for gun shots. You were aghast at the video so your ears tried to protect you from the sound?"
Glorp,ff6m4w2,t3_erpw1j,1579630135.0,"I feel like this is a picture of my tit, but I know for sure it's not. Husband thinks so too. Hi boob twin!"
tifu,ff6exuv,t1_ff5gr5y,1579625721.0,I guess I've never been one to poke hole is a story. I forgot how naive I am most days. My husband sometimes jokes it's his job to protect my gullible ass.
tifu,ff4gxl5,t1_ff4axtc,1579563345.0,"Ya, on some toilets my husband has to hold his dick while pooping or it will sit in the toilet water. Some people have big dicks, some toilets are too small, sometimes both."
dogs,ff4dti2,t3_erfncn,1579561245.0,I love this! They sound adorable as fuck. Glad you all have each other.
