AmItheAsshole,ff9cv17,t3_erwdex,1579710161.0,"YTA. Damn this girl really opened up to you and that was your response. On behalf of every scared anxious person who struggles making friends, absolutely you are an ass."
AmItheAsshole,ff9cp8k,t3_esbm63,1579710039.0,NTA. My mum stopped waking me up when I was like 10 or 11. That’s plenty old enough to haul your own ass out of bed. You’re doing them a favour in the end.
AmItheAsshole,ff9chhr,t3_es6oiz,1579709874.0,NTA. What kind of fuckery is this??? For our first anniversary my partner took me to a restaurant I wanted to try and treated me to the meal (I tried to pay for half but at the time I was broke). Now I have enough money so on Valentine’s Day I got us a fancy hotel room and a booking at one of his favourite restaurants. It’s because he CARED about what I wanted and I CARED about what he wanted. Plus we discussed expectations beforehand! Your boyfriend is an absolute moron.
AmItheAsshole,ff997pu,t3_esabza,1579707746.0,"YTA. 

Let me tell you something. You reek. I don’t even need to be near you to know that for sure. Every smoker thinks they’re so slick and no one notices and meanwhile I’m sucking in that ventolin like it’s crack."
BeautyGuruChatter,ff281zs,t3_eqckpg,1579496508.0,PUPPIES ARE SO DAMN HARD. I raised one on my own and I love my big boof now but I promise you NEVER AGAIN. I was in tears every day and waking up every 2-3 hours.

AmItheAsshole,fewph6n,t3_eqh642,1579417540.0,NTA. I’ve lost both my mother and my father. I have no interest in these days.
dogs,femfmh5,t3_epy090,1579252974.0,Marking our territory does videos and blogs if you’re into Rhodesian Ridgebacks! He has a new book out now as well!
dogs,femfjkg,t3_epuxhw,1579252854.0,Not all ridgebacks have the ridge when mixed with other dogs but that dog has ridgeback in it for SURE. Also some purebreds come out ridgeless as a genetic quirk it has no bearing on the health of the dog though!
dogs,fejxe0p,t3_epi99u,1579188031.0,What the HELL were your parents doing getting a puppy??? This is on them for being absolutely terrible dog owners.
creepy,fej71sx,t3_ep3hb0,1579159582.0,He wasn’t even a doctor do none of y’all watch that awesome mortician on youtube?
BeautyGuruChatter,feczkep,t1_fe92vgm,1578991267.0,Flying interstate over east is a short and p cheap flight. If you’re from Perth (my town) it’s different cos WA is so huge and away from everything but otherwise it’s not a lot of money or time...
BeautyGuruChatter,feczeub,t3_eo6gqr,1578991059.0,“Flying interstate” from where she is located (Sydney) is not a long flight. Anyone from the eastern states can be there fast it’s not like the US. Unless people are literally flying from Perth (wassup) then I don’t see the big deal.
AmItheAsshole,febxu5q,t3_eo33vy,1578964037.0,NTA. I have a menstrual cup and I have a seperate small pot I boil water in to clean it. That is disgusting.
dogs,febwo7f,t3_eo5tdp,1578963575.0,LMFAO Great Danes are the CLINGIEST dogs I’ve ever met! And I have a RR myself and he’s my angel who indeed loves to sleep all day... because we exercise him two hours a day and spent a lot of time training him. He would rip the house up if we didn’t!!! They are absolutely not the dog for everyone because of their stubbornness.
childfree,fdztddf,t3_en80ex,1578795346.0,Stop dating women with kids then??? You sound like a huge asshole regardless of whether or not you want to have kids.
relationships,fdzsknp,t3_encilj,1578794798.0,Real talk: he wants to bang this chick until she moves somewhere and then go back to you. He’s making sure you’re still available while he bangs other women. No one in any successful poly relationship I know starts the process when one is already trying to get their dick wet.
thesims,fdw9sma,t3_en58ef,1578756538.0,Oh I love love it!!!!
Nanny,fdvv0xs,t3_en7d1r,1578751754.0,"Parents were off on a work trip and mum had anxiety and was so upset about leaving her boys. I got her calm, told her they’d be fine. 

I had a car t-bone me while I was driving the boys to school. Luckily I was in their massive 4WD and the car only got a bad dent. The boys cried out of shock but I told them it was all okay and I would deal with it. The guy was driving some fancy shit arse car and hadn’t looked before belting into a busy school intersection. I absolutely went off on this guy, told him he was a damn idiot. Got all his details for insurance and then I had to call the parents who were at the airport which was horrible. 

Dropped the boys off after they spoke to their mum (car was perfectly safe to drive). Mum called me back crying saying she was in shock but so glad I’d handled everything for insurance because she said she would have been too upset. Honestly I thought I’d handled it badly I really went in on this man. But I’m glad she felt her kids were still safe with me even in a car crash."
AmItheAsshole,fdvs7fe,t3_emu7yf,1578750966.0,NTA. This has happened and my partner who is a fully qualified nurse was leery of volunteering because he didn’t want to seem up himself. He quietly told the attendant he was a nurse and if there was no doctor he could provide some help. Turns out it was a bad panic attack and my partner is trained in mental health so he was able to help out very effectively and I was about bursting with pride but honestly he was so embarrassed by the whole thing.
AmItheAsshole,fdvqmr0,t3_en6jau,1578750379.0,NTA. I wish the parents of my bullies took this seriously before I tried to kill myself.
AmItheAsshole,fdvpaq1,t3_emtsuc,1578750002.0,Look NTA but just learn a few phrases in an obscure language and say those. I speak Greek and the amount of times I’ve spoken Greek to annoying guys has saved my ass too. That way you can be respectful of the Deaf and also tell these guys to fuck off.
dogs,fdvd8iq,t3_en286p,1578746241.0,My dog gets it EVERY DAY. He’s a Ridgeback but just a particularly handsome specimen and my god if we take a walk and no one stops to comment then I take GREAT OFFENCE. He’s also very friendly and gentle and kids flock to him like flies on honey. He’s curled up on my lap (all 40kg of him) right now.
AmItheAsshole,fdm8fgk,t3_elwqyq,1578542373.0,NTA. My partners gift to me was a necklace that cost maybe $30 but I absolutely adore it because it had some words on it that were meaningful to us. I cried with happiness when I got it because he put thought into it. That’s all you wanted and that okay!
AmItheAsshole,fdjig25,t3_elc9ld,1578472273.0,YTA your daughter is an ADULT!!! And how women dress has no correlation to their sexual activity!!!

Nanny,fdf2ezk,t3_ekw2o9,1578351759.0,My last one did and the absolute fucking joke was her and her husband were both senior HR hirers of CEOs and shit contracted out by the biggest companies in Australia. Husband easily on 200k wife probably on 100k. I was paid around 18k a year. Do that math.
AskReddit,fcvpqvj,t3_eixc75,1578007329.0,I’m with the absolute love of my life that I met on Tinder!
relationship_advice,fctf3en,t3_eis9f9,1577941234.0,"My partner is 29 and plays a lot of WoW. He’s very good at it and he has some great and supportive friends from it. 

But he pays for himself and plays only after all other business is attended to. That means me, the dog, the chores, anything we need to get done. He has a regular raiding schedule that he plans around and I don’t have to do any of the emotional labour. 

This child you’re living with is allowing you to enable his lazy lifestyle. Ditch him."
relationship_advice,fcteo9l,t3_eiof02,1577940853.0,My brother has defs talked to me while I’m just in my bra and undies and my sister will sit in the bathroom if she needs to chat with me and I’m in the shower. None of us live together anymore but I certainly wouldn’t be bothered by it. Your friends are weird.
dogs,fctdh0v,t3_eit3i9,1577939800.0,"It varies. My cousins dog didn’t stop crying at night for two MONTHS. I was warned it would be hell and crate training would be impossible etc. 

My pup cried for half an hour on the first night and 15 minutes on the second before conking our asleep! I think I got away with murder."
dogs,fctd9a9,t3_eilu6d,1577939613.0,"My dog is pretty big so I usually let him deal with a potential attacker because anything he could do is ten times more effective than me. Ridgebacks are... look my vet says incredibly brave, I say he’s incredibly stupid! A dog can latch onto him and he’ll act like it ain’t SHIT. One good shake and the attacker is off. I’ve seen him drag a rottie by the neck who was repeatedly attacking and humping him and we couldn’t get away and the damn owner wasn’t intervening properly. He literally pushed this dog into the ground and held him there and was easily 10kg heavier than him.

I’ve only had to intervene on a dog attacking my dog once because they were BOTH going for each other. The owner of the other dog was right there too and it was our faults, not the dogs. We shouldn’t have had a play date when my dog was fixed and hers wasn’t yet. When her dog was fixed they were able to play happily together again!"
AmItheAsshole,fcr2xj0,t1_fcpr9rw,1577896010.0,Yeah my partner has pulled a few people out in his time when they have a look on their face that just says “yo what tf”
AmItheAsshole,fcr2r4j,t3_eif98x,1577895933.0,"YTA! I’ve been to a few metal concerts/gigs with my BF and he warned me the first time about moshing and to STAY OUT OF IT. I am tiny, I would be crushed. You didn’t think to warn her nor did you stop to see if she was okay. I’ve seen Ed Sheeran stop a damn concert to check if a girl up front who fainted was okay. If massive stars and huge metal bands can do it then so can you."
AmItheAsshole,fcoy59t,t3_ei4mi6,1577844815.0,NTA but absolutely don’t tie up another persons dog outside. It’s not safe for the dog and it isn’t their fault their owner is a prick.
relationships,fcowkcc,t3_ei53li,1577843539.0,"It’s absolutely batshit that your parents would insist on you, a woman in her 30s, not have a partner for the holidays because it “pulls you away” and the fact you’ll cater to that means you absolutely need more therapy.

Having said that your boyfriend is also being  an arse. You are so controlled by your parents that it would probably push a decent man to distraction but this guy doesn’t sound like a peach either."
AmItheAsshole,fcnfpys,t1_fcm8y9i,1577810778.0,I’m Australian. Not an excuse.
BeautyGuruChatter,fclz37j,t3_ehv72y,1577760015.0,Bushfires have been a part of growing up Aussie as long as I can remember but nothing on this level. I’m in WA and work with people who live rurally. Some of them have lost homes that their families had for 200 years in an HOUR.
AskReddit,fclupsm,t3_ehquh9,1577756926.0,I think more available education on child development and parenting for parents would be incredible especially for those from low socioeconomic backgrounds as well as additional financial support. That would probably solve more issues than going full 1984 on them.
relationship_advice,fckd257,t3_ehlwqh,1577722604.0,"This is beyond the pay grade of this sub but can I just say, you’re doing an amazing job and everything best you can for your son and grandson."

AmItheAsshole,fcgepcx,t3_eh3i79,1577639231.0,"YTA!!! You have a child with this woman! 

However, if you think she can’t keep financial secrets from her family and put you and your child first then she is also the asshole. I think some money should go towards therapy if she is so bad at drawing boundaries."
AmItheAsshole,fc8oxfr,t3_eglv7i,1577539306.0,"NTA. Am Lego collector, would be FUCKING FUMING."
AmItheAsshole,fc8osno,t3_egnqln,1577539236.0,"NTA. I sometimes look at my partners hemmaroids for him, doesn’t mean I don’t tell him they’re gross as fuck cos they are! He laughs, I laugh, world moves on. If I had a warty vag I’d only let him look because he is a qualified nurse but no sexy times would be going on!"
