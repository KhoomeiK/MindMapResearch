AskReddit,ffgm1z0,t3_etcyd6,1579909376.0,"So many great answers lol. In my opinion, we are telling men that every urge in their body is wrong. The urges say to fuck and fight. We don't do that shit anymore. Well, some do. In fact. I wouldn't be surprised to find that there are a few dudes getting a lot of ass while a a lot get none. And if you fight, you are a savage."
AskReddit,ffgle4x,t1_fffjokr,1579908927.0,"As a man, I understand the things that make me feel certain ways and talking about it really isn't the answer, because talking about it isn't gonna do shit."
AskReddit,ffe1yxg,t1_ffdptau,1579834600.0,"Bro, everybody in this country bitchesss so much. I work with a lot of Mexican immigrants and they all have their own houses and their kids have cars and they are figuring out how to get their kids into college and shit. 

Sure, it sucks that they work so many hours, but you know what, they aren't the ones complaining about it. They all have money to go buy cars in cash and shit. I work with one guy who barely speaks the language and he and his wife have worked hard enough in restaraunts to pay off their decently big house and some land back in Honduras to retire to. 

So how come we got so many people in this country that act like they are too good to work for certain wages, but also bitch that they should be given housing and shit."

Thunder,ff8fuuq,t3_es1ivl,1579676649.0,He grew it out on the sides a little to hide the hairline. Plus maybe some color.
MMA,ff83hm2,t1_ff7ts8x,1579664997.0,"A percentage of PPV salea. Points is another word for percentage in this scenario. So maybe he gets 2% or 1% of PPV sales. If it does 60 million in sales, he would get $1,200,000 or $600,000"
PoliticalHumor,ff7bhtd,t1_ff7a5rh,1579645555.0,"Not really. Maybe in the past. I think now when people hear the term thrown out, they just assume it's some young white person calling anyone they disagree with racist. It has lost its meaning."
Zoomies,ff1yn8p,t1_ff1y5bh,1579489206.0,"Weak comeback. If humans were doing something genetically that required  babies to be born by C section, you wouldn't be cool with it. We control this shit and should not be encouraging the breeding of dogs with short snouts. There are plenty of sources online documenting health problems that arise from this shit and we continue to support it with our money for vanity. 

All of that, and I'm not even mentioning the fact that we are putting down millions of dogs a year in this country while idiots pay $1,000 for Frenchies so they can go to Frenchie groups hehe."
Zoomies,ff1x5mv,t1_ff1v91q,1579488202.0,"I doubt they leave the womb. I'm sure the have to be surgically removed like bulldog puppies. These genetic monstrosities created for human vanity can't even give birth naturally.

Edit- [for all the people downvoting, this is the first result when you search french bulldog c-section. 80% lol. they also have to artifically inseminated. Take the L and think about creating an animal with so many health problems because you see them so much on instagram lol](https://i.imgur.com/AO10ZWk.jpg)"

todayilearned,fenkira,t3_epye6b,1579286646.0,"Lot of comments on here praising a serial killer. Kind of weird. Really a terrorist like McVeigh. And Reddit loves it and they romanticize him and his genius and his lifestyle and beliefs.

 The dude killed three innocent people by basically blowing their faces off with a package in the mail. He left others disfigured with burns to their face and hands. A few of his victims lost fingers and a hand. He's not a good person and fuck all the little 20 year old communists around here that think he's cool."

Thunder,femdisd,t1_felqr50,1579249944.0,"I dunno, Grant is a player I think this sub overrates. He was wild with the ball when he drove. He ""spaces"" the floor, but not insanely. I don't think he was a great passer. He played in the corner a lot. So, maybe there isn't a ""right way"" to use him. Maybe he is just a bench player."
trashy,fehqu6l,t1_fehibn6,1579122048.0,"I'm sure you can find the number. Be the change you want to see. Ahh shit, that last line works on two levels.

And while you're at it, let him know I'm looking to prosecute for all the pens that have ever been stolen from me."
JusticeServed,fehj1xc,t1_fehekt6,1579117551.0,There is no shortage of customers in china.
trashy,fehd8fg,t1_fehcc78,1579114155.0,"Must just be a Texas thing I guess, because many restaraunts do it and like every bar in my city does it. Sometimes you get 20 cents and sometimes you lose it. Unless you care, then you ask and get your exact change."
trashy,fehd2dc,t1_fehcrlv,1579114058.0,Well someone should call the district attorney and let em know about all the bars and restaraunts out here stealing money. Lol
trashy,fehcxec,t1_fehbbtu,1579113977.0,"Well, apparently you are an idiot because THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO THEIR CHANGE."
trashy,feh80v5,t1_feh4pmz,1579111057.0,"And I'm with ya. I'm kind of a cheap ass myself, so when I spot them 20 cents when the bill is 1.20, it hurts my cheap soul. But, in the end it isn't worth the time to go get a cash register open and get exact change. So i understand why it might upset people, I just hope that those people just act politely when they ask for exact change. And i would hope the server would acr politely in return."
trashy,feh7oql,t1_feh3619,1579110861.0,"And I'm telling you that there are plenty of bars and restaraunts across the country that use the rounding method. They are all aware that you have a right to exact change, so if it bothers you, you can just ask. Unless you are saying that I'm making up the fact that a lot of places round, then I don't know what to tell ya."
trashy,feh09l8,t1_fegvo82,1579106433.0,Do you think the waitress would refuse to give you back exact change if you asked her?
