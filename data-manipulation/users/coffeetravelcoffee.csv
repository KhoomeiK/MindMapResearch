BeautyGuruChatter,ffxn6cj,t1_ffwh8zk,1580328535.0,"Can we just CC this to every guru that wants to be a boss? I'm a professional and freelance, if I behaved in such petty, attention-seeking, just plain unprofessional ways there is no way any client would work with me. Why do beauty gurus act like this? It seems the absolute antithesis of being a strong, independent woman in business and leans far too heavily into the boss-babe, MLM attitude.  


Your point about being liked is bang on too. Do my clients ""like"" me? I don't know or care. Do they respect the work I do and my professionalism? Yes, and that is all I need to know. Whether they think I'm a sweetheart or not doesn't get their work done or my bills paid. I get that YouTube is all about likeability, but once you move into the realm of running a business that mindset needs to change. Clapping back on social media as a YouTuber can be messy, but clapping back as the CEO of a brand you built from the ground up? Tacky, sis, tacky.   


And this isn't just Marlena. This is the whole lot of them."
BeautyGuruChatter,ffwxjzw,t1_ffwvg16,1580313275.0,"I'll see if I can find it again. It all came out during the Bye, Sisters drama. Quick version, James has had some questionable practices with multiple management companies opening and going under. What got me though was the family home drama with accusations he scammed family out of the house/money, and the fact that he and Tati were very much together at the time. If it's all true, there's no way she didn't know. 

Damn! Everything has been deleted! There was a Patheos article, which is I think the one I read, but it's been taken down. I'll poke about more after work and I'll update if I find something solid."
BeautyGuruChatter,ffwqjcf,t1_ffvihfv,1580308574.0,"Makes sense considering the apparent quality. Also, I'm sure that plush fabric never looks the same after being soaked in product like foundation/concealer and then washed (assuming it survives).

After reading about the shady business practices her husband has participated in, including scamming his own family allegedly, watching Tati shovelling out nonsense like magic beans and QVC sponges is not that big a surprise. I don't think she is who she portrays, at all."

AskReddit,ffvo5v5,t3_ev92p0,1580268756.0,"Chili's. I was horribly ill and stuck in a hotel room for a night. SO was trying to temp me to eat, so he went to the Chilli's nearby to pick me up some chicken soup and a flatbread. Well, the soup was lava hot and yet completely congealed. The only flavours were styrofoam container and salt.

The flatbread looked like it had been flattened by throwing it on the highway. It had exactly 7 faded, dry, tomato bits on it. It tasted like cardboard and sadness.

Two years later I still can't see a Chilli's without shuddering."

Thanks too, for the moisturizer ideas. I *was* using my skin oil (argan oil) which really makes a difference, but my lazy ass got away from it, thinking just my serum was enough. Now I am back to it and it's helping. I'm also going to try the Embryolisse, it's been on my wish list for a bit now, time to just buy and try.

Thanks again!"

AmItheAsshole,ffjhp9h,t1_ffipunx,1579998461.0,"I was abused as a child as well (narc mother) and if it were me, I would say no unsupervised visits until the child is old enough to talk clearly about what happens at Gma and Gpa's house when they visit. 

The OP has justified concerns based on her interactions with the GPs, they don't respect boundaries and OP also commented on the Gma being a bit odd. That doesn't mean they're bad people, or going to harm the child, but their behaviour is ringing some alarm bells for me."
AmItheAsshole,ffjfuz6,t1_ffim63j,1579997371.0,"Same here. It's one thing to spend alone time with grandparents or favourite relatives when the kid is old enough to say yes or no to the visit, but to demand alone time with an infant, especially one still breastfeeding, is weird to me.  

And the junk food thing happened to my cousin. Her kid was older, but same idea. Another relative had decided my cousin was too strict with the kid's diet and when she took her out for the day fed the kid allll the junk food. Well, the reason the kid was never given junk was because she has sensitivities to food dyes, and she ended up spending the whole night vomiting and just miserable."
aww,ffj9dhd,t3_ettwh3,1579993514.0,"For everyone who loves and wants a dog, but can't have one just now due to lack of space or similar issues, remember you can visit your local shelter and walk the doggos. Shelters often need volunteers too, so if you're a student needing some job experience you can get it and get lots of dog cuddles at the same time. Everybody wins."
BeautyGuruChatter,ffj7h6o,t1_ffiq4vf,1579992306.0,"You're absolutely right. I do get the reaction of the Sugary owner, though. I'm a freelancer and if I had a huge company come after me I'd be freaking out too. There is no way in hell I could afford a lawyer to represent me. And in this case, with a company like KKW, we're probably talking an entire legal team; that's pretty damn intimidating. 

If what the Sugary owner is saying is true about paying KKW for the sales, she may be worried that her entire company will get wiped out, again, I get why she would panic. 

Maybe someone needs to start offering some Business 101 courses online for indie brands though."
BeautyGuruChatter,ffj54wt,t3_etu1tz,1579990646.0,"Well, there goes any chance I will ever buy KKW. That woman has more money than the fucking Pope; it's insultingly laughable that a small indie brand is impacting their sales or profits. 

The greed and entitlement of that whole family is disgusting.

Edit to say that I understand that KKW is probably well within their legal rights to do this, but that still doesn't make it right. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you must."

bisexualadults,ffin92g,t3_etmyqr,1579977943.0,"I go with the idea that other people's opinions of me are none of my business. I come from a background of abuse as a child that left me hypervigilant to perceived reactions/emotions from others so this little mantra lets me step back and let go of that constant vigilance.

And fun fact, I was reading a recently released study that found that we are actually pretty bad at interpreting others facial expressions. That helped me a lot, now when I think someone is displeased with me (which usually causes me a lot of anxiety) I laugh at my brain and think, yeah, they're not upset with me, they might just have gas.

It's not unreasonable for any employee to ask for a raise, especially when you're making less than minimum wage.

I'd be upset too. You did them a real favour by taking lower pay when you knew they were not doing especially well financially and for them to not only not offer to pay you more, but to refuse when you approached them is definitely asshole behavior. 

If it's any consolation, those cars and trips won't be lasting long. It sounds like they have no idea how to handle money and they're going to repeat the classic lottery winners story and be flat broke again by this time next year. I had an acquaintance do the same.

raisedbynarcissists,ff9vy2d,t3_es2xzm,1579722689.0,"I've been dealing with this lately too. For me, I feel now that I know who/what I am, but I still feel like I'm very much behind everyone else. My father died when I was 12, so it was nmom and me from that point out. She told me on my 13th birthday that I was ""an adult now and can make your own decisions"" so I feel like I was a feral child in a lot of ways. Up until my mid-30s I was only myself with my SO. For everyone else I was a mirror. This was fine for one on one socializing, but groups of friends was hell. It all came to a head one day when I looked in the mirror and felt like I had no idea anymore of who I really was. It was rather terrifying to be honest, staring in the mirror thinking, who am I?

So, I stopped mirroring and started, slowly, opening up as myself. I can still be a bit reserved, but maybe that's not a bad thing. I used to be entirely too trusting and ended up being friends with people who were toxic. I still feel behind in terms of social skills and making and nurturing friendships but thankfully about 3 years ago I found a group of people that are amazing. They have no fucks to give about money, looks, clothes, or anything else superficial, they just care if you're a good person. They have, unknowingly, helped me be more me and they make me want to keep growing as a person.

So, yes, I do feel robbed. I spent 47 years of my life thinking I was nothing, damaged, worthless, a burden. I'm now 50 and feel like I'm finally me, a me that still needs to grow and learn and undo the damage that was done, but I have hope now that this half of my life is going to be good, for real."
