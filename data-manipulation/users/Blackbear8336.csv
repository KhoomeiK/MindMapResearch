depressionregimens,ffdv6sk,t3_et1h43,1579829735.0,I started to feel the effects around when I started taking 100 mg but I after a while I reverted back to where I was mentally. Now I take 200 along with 20mg of lexepro and 100mg of trazadone. It's best to take an anti depressant with lamictal so you don't have mood swings but also don't have depression. Lamictal will stabilize your mood but won't help you depression much.
depression,ffdunaa,t3_eswd3w,1579829347.0,I found that apps like tinder and bumble are actually good for making friends! Also maybe try playing online video games if you're not sure you can handle meeting people in person! IV made some good friends online thru tinder and Reddit mostly and playing games online will maybe make it easier to talk to people cause you already have something in common! I hope all goes well for you!

I know what it's like to lose someone that you thought was your soulmate. Hes not worth it. He's really not. You will find your soulmate one day. Everyone has one. And if you ever need to talk you can message me! Anytime."
