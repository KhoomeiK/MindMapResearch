vegan,ffcn324,t3_esg38u,1579802956.0,Funny enough this one is posted by u/lnfinity who is a member here who posts cute animals and such on the larger subs to erode at that dissonance :)
confessions,ff9tkpq,t1_ff9ovmm,1579720968.0,I can see you’re not trying to be mean but “the gay aids” is stigmatizing. It’s also kinda disrespectful to assume he died of AIDs because he was gay. Just a friendly reminder :)
confessions,ff9qgi7,t1_ff9lqns,1579718709.0,"Yeah we can’t all be legally married but we’re lucky that Canada is pretty supportive of multiple legal parents, so we can all have parental rights of any children."

MurderedByWords,ff9guy5,t1_ff94okm,1579712735.0,"It’s ok to have preferences it’s not ok to be a dick, man or woman. Body positivity at its core is good for everyone, men and women. It’s ok to love yourself and your body AND acknowledge that there are things you’d like to work on. Or not, cause it’s your body and people don’t have the right to police it."

GenderCynical,ff687y9,t1_ff5t4hn,1579621442.0,Oh it’s in the linked thread
GenderCynical,ff44f4q,t1_ff3zjw8,1579555302.0,">The original poster's goal character isn't even super traditionally feminine, she's clearly well built and has a strong jawline. She's beautiful, but she's no tiny delicate waif (as GC loves to imply all trans women aspire to be).


Yeah about that...they’re tearing down Noelle Stevenson saying she draws She-Ra like a “TIM” because...she’s jealous of well endowed women. That’s a lot to unpack."

onguardforthee,fetm0ll,t1_ferv8wt,1579376785.0,"I had a coworker complain about people calling in sick because it’s disloyal to their employers. Honestly I was baffled because when I do call in sick I’m concerned how it will affect our clients and our team, idgaf about the employer."
YouOnLifetime,festkgc,t1_feqs3nz,1579368899.0,"Her actions led Forty right into her arms and led him to be dependent on her. Which I think is exactly what she wanted at the time, to have someone who would always be there and hold her up as the most important person in his life because he felt he had no other options. It’s extremely similar to what Joe does."
YouOnLifetime,fessrsb,t1_fep4lq6,1579368645.0,That’s what Joe does too though. But he had the advantage of already manipulating everyone around him so Candace had zero leverage with anyone in LA
YouOnLifetime,fesshmv,t1_feo02he,1579368563.0,Until Love showed her true colours she had actually succeeded. She had him.
YouOnLifetime,fesroxf,t1_feps1r6,1579368315.0,"She learned that Joe was still doing what he had done to her and was not facing consequences. She was ENRAGED but also terrified for the safety of other women and took action that made sense to her. She wanted justice and saw this as the only way. I think she also wanted to prove to herself that she could overcome him, prove that she didn’t need to be afraid. Trauma brain can make you do crazy stuff. See Joe and Love."
YouOnLifetime,fesqsx6,t1_feptyof,1579368023.0,It beautifully illustrates how these situations work though. People don’t want to believe someone they think is a good guy is actually abusive.
VeganFoodPorn,fekp99i,t1_fekn92v,1579204769.0,"Yeah valid,  probably just wishful thinking on my part. I can’t remember ever being picky but that’s probably just my personality"
VeganFoodPorn,fekgtx7,t1_fekg2tw,1579199757.0, I find the bean based pastas are only good freshly cooked cause they get this grainy hard texture once they’re chilled. I don’t like it anyway but ymmv
VeganFoodPorn,fekgn9n,t1_fek5tbq,1579199644.0,It doesn’t seem hard. Just grab a small blender and feed em what you’re eating as a baby. Make the chunks bigger as they’re able and they will be used to the tastes and textures by the time they’re older. Kids need exposure to new foods like 5 times before they’ll get used to them so of course they’re gonna reject unfamiliar foods. I’ve heard it also depends on what you eat when you’re pregnant cause some of the flavours can end up in amniotic fluid.

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,feiiyhg,t3_ep4dp7,1579139610.0,Right in the gut. On the plus side (maybe?) they must not have a remote clue you’re trans or they probably wouldn’t have said that.
facepalm,feii7k2,t1_fehg18s,1579139117.0,"Yes this is correct. Just remove the adjective trans from “trans woman” and you have woman who is attracted to women, a gay trans woman."
