As for the audio adapter... i'd probably just wire my own to be honest. Finding an official cable would probably be pretty expensive and rare. 

Just get a 3-pin DIN connector and wire it to whatever connector you need on the other end (1/4"", 1/8"", RCA or whatever).

And this narrative that the British gave India civil government and infrastructure is one we've been hearing for a long time, when in reality tens of millions of people died under Victorian holocausts, existing social/political structures were destroyed and poverty took over as a result. The policies the British enacted in most of their colonies was not for the benefit of the local people, but to siphon as much wealth and power as they could.

""I'm afraid"" is a weird way of ending a sentence. You said India was never a unified state. It has been unified under local imperial rule so how is that wrong? It's also historically been seen as a single region of peoples by others. Indian muslims from various regions going to mecca were recognized as being from the same area, al-hind. 

You also said that ""The British gave India the infrastructure it needed to become a single country with a civil government.""

And I don't think that argument stands any real ground. Many other regions of the world unified without colonialism, there's no reason to think the Indian region couldn't have unified without the British. They already had a huge economy, goods moving internally and externally, complex societies. To argue that the British *gave* India a ""civil"" government is disingenuous and lacks nuance."
