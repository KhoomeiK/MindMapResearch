todayilearned,ff533cg,t3_ermtk2,1579578904.0,"This is not necessarily true. We already have the capacity to feed the entire population, but not everyone gets food for other reasons. A rich country could send a poorer country a certain amount of food, but that does not even mean that the people who need that food the most will get it. Corrupt governments could find a way to profit out of it. The food could spoil. There may not be enough infrastructure/logistics in order to deliver all the food. 

Then we have the issue that the citizens of the rich country may not want to spend money on other countries, but rather direct it toward problems at home. They may feel that it is not their responsibility to feed people from other countries (a valid point). Next, you create a dependency on the rich country that will in the long run be detrimental to the poor country. Giving free stuff away usually will make productivity drop, which would damage the growth potential of the country.

Economic growth is achieved through incentives. The incentive that I will make a profit off an investment. Countries that are succesful in providing these incentives have become enormously wealthy.

Let's not forget about the entire Lewisnky Scandal, when the entire nation was divided on whether a blowjob was an offense worthy of removal from office. Let us not forget about when Reagan secretly negotiated with the Iranians not to release American prisoners until he took office (similar thing with Nixon in Vietnam). And also let us not forget that people from this country fought each other for 4 long years over what they believed was right (or at least morally acceptable). There have been great quarrels about how the country is to be governed since literally the first day after this nation's creation. The founding fathers were in disagreement about many things. 

&#x200B;

Take a look at the Spanish Civil War. You had people going out to the streets looking for people to kill simply because they sustained other political beliefs than someone else did. You must recognize that this division (which has always existed, by the way), is -- I dare say --  intentionally exaggerated by the news outlets of the entire political spectrum in order to release more content. Then you get these documentaries falsely portraying the state of American society as a whole. You discuss politics every day because you are in a site where politics are discussed routinely. People post about literally anything anyone says. ""Leading psychologist says Trump has dementia"". ""Ilhan Omar is a radical extremist"". ""Ivanka Trump bought a Caramel Macchiato and that shows our extreme class inequality"". I have not discussed politics in person with anyone outside my family in years. It just does not come up."

The entire purpose of college is for you to further your education and transition from being a teen into being an adult. If you fail to do that, then it was wasted. You might have a bad semester or two, but as a whole college should improve you. 

You might want to examine why you are feeling this. Perhaps you do not like your major. Just remember that you would just sit at home doing nothing if you refused to go. You have a lot of posts here saying how depression or meltdowns prevented them from finishing college, but remember that you are investing in yourself. Ask yourself why you are feeling this way and try to address the problem head on. Do not quit (unless of course you benefit from not going to college)."

You have people voting on things of which they know nothing about (I get that it is impossible to know everything about anything). Take Iran, for example. You have people saying it is a secret Saudi/Israeli conspiracy, or that the conflict is being manufactured by American arms and oil companies. Is there some truth to that? Perhaps. Is it the entire reason? No. I took the time to read a 900-page book on the Middle East, and I know that conflict has existed in the Middle East for thousands of years. I know that the United States needs a Muslim buffer state that stands as a pillar of stability in the ME. I know that Iran used to be that state (though Iran is not an Arab state), and since 1979, the U.S. has been forced to rely on Saudi Arabia, the other big state in the ME, to act as said buffer. I know that the strait of Hormuz is critical for global shipping, and particularly for the global distribution of the oil that comes from the ME.
