I would have many a great chat with him, and he always seemed to be enjoying the convos.  When he was done, he would literally tangent into ""Okay I need to work now,"" and turn to his keyboard.  The first time this happened, I didn't know what to think other than I'd overstayed.  The next time it happened I realized it was just how he was.  He and I enjoyed heading out for lunches, so it wasn't like we didn't get on.
