We have continued to outlive plenty of other species.  

We have the ability to understand when something is over hunted and we attempt to protect them. 

What makes a species successful and not successful has NOTHING to do with happiness.  It’s all about surviving and breeding which is really surviving.  

And as fucked up as this statement is...  

Rapists (in theory) help the survival of the species.  

Rape also happens in other species as well.  Murder to some degree is pretty common over territorial disputes.  Lions and bears are two examples I can think of for territorial disputes but I’m sure it happens in most species.  

Humans are normal in those regards, we just have the ability to look beyond the simple requirements for survival and because of this we are the superior species - not a failed one."

It’s fascinating to me that actions are his love language.  I wonder what causes love language to develop.  

I came from domestic violence myself but I prefer words of affirmation/touch.  Wife prefers actions.  

Makes ya wonder."

offmychest,ffq5zl3,t3_euhcwt,1580122348.0,"At the very least though, for her sake if you care to, you could let her know that this was the reason in a very calm way.  Just so that she can reflect on it and maybe in the future in her next relationship she won’t make these same mistakes.  

Just an idea, definitely don’t have to do this."
offmychest,ffq5w2r,t3_eujesv,1580122204.0,"Maybe just start off with a normal therapist instead of going for one that specializes in anything.  

Normal therapists are cheaper, a lot cheaper.  

It’s not really about the money but it sounds like taking a baby step here and just getting used to talking to someone and building the trust with them may allow you to open up to not just your therapist but to your own self in general."
rant,ff138sz,t1_feybzai,1579474746.0,"It’s something you say to someone to comfort them.  

Especially in trauma therapy, you tell the patient that they what they are feeling is normal.  You tell them they’re not alone in feeling these things - especially if they feel they are alone in it.  

It just makes us feel better."
rant,fexfv8f,t1_fewlssh,1579430307.0,"When I was 18, I didn’t get it.  The older you get it actually makes sense.   A lot of the things you “unlock” when you reach 18 won’t heavily influence your decision making.  Alcohol most certainly will though which is why it’s 21.  

Cigs are 21 now but they should just be illegal.  They’re 21 now as a compromise so tobacco companies and keep making money killing people.  

Having and deciding to own a gun doesn’t influence your decision making.  At most it might make you decide to fight instead of flee, which is what it’s meant for."

Ezpz.  

If she says no, well then you’ve saved your time.  

“Hey, I’ve got some time before chemistry, you wanna grab a coffee with me?”  

Something like that.  Make it as casual as possible to simply talk to her.  Get an idea of what you’re going for, then go from there.  

I prefer not beating around the bush and being direct after the coffee.  If you enjoyed talking to her ask her out to dinner.  

After dinner figure out where you stand.

rant,felwf4g,t3_eptyb7,1579232626.0,"The reason you have social anxiety and don’t want to talk to someone to order is because options like that  exist for you to begin with.  

Kiosks are not for people with social anxiety, they’re there to help out with the line and to free up cashiers.  

The internet wasn’t made for people who have social anxiety.  

Trust me on this one, you can avoid it all day but eventually after you haven’t eaten for 48 hours you will overcome this and go talk to the person.  

You also could pretend to be mute/dead and write down your order if you’re that afraid to talk.  And when you realize how much more infinitely awkward that is...  just fucking speak."
AMA,fdmtoub,t1_fdjo1jy,1578565287.0,"Hello stranger.  

I just wanted to reach out and say something that helped me get through my hard times when I really felt like giving up and saw absolutely no hope in the future.

relationships,fdi62yb,t3_eliwpy,1578436378.0,"Personally, I’d say no to any close friends.  

To me that’s just asking for trouble.  I have never been quite in this position, it’s mostly just been joked about until I really thought about how it would potentially affect our relationship and then decided to stop joking about it.  

But if you two feel like going for it, that’s your business.  Including close friends makes it tricky though.  Because then it’s no longer just about her getting something, it’s about her yearning for something beyond simple friends with this other girl.  

Not to mention it’s going to be forever there in all friend interactions exactly what happened.  

Go with a semi-stranger."

Your situation sounds pretty similar to what I grew up with.  I’m 26 now.  

You have two main choices: You tough it out, make the best of what it is and try not to poke the bear or you go to the police with real evidence.  Video evidence, and be willing to testify against your father in court if it goes to that.  

I’m gonna tell you right now, if it comes to that, you might think you’re ready but you’re gonna break down and start crying/choking over your words and you will struggle to maintain composure.  I did (years later), and I’m not an emotional person.  

I poked the bear nonstop, I thought eventually if I stood up he would eventually change and while it sort of worked it probably wasn’t worth the effort and the results weren’t long lasting, he just learned how to not treat me but still was very physical/mental/verbal with my mother.  

If you go to the police you need to make sure that your mother or anyone else in the picture does not defend your father.  If there’s any chance of that, it’s bad because if you have video evidence and your mother lies to protect your dad, you could get sent into foster care which is like rolling a die - might be better, might be worse.  Because they might see both of your parents as unfit to raise you.  So just weigh that out.  

If he can’t be reasoned with then prepare for the worst.  Workout, get strong, be able to kick his ass and be able to defend your family but don’t get angry and kill him.  

Do not ruin your life.  You have a future and it’s bright and happy and full of wonderful things.  I promise you.  

Get some therapy when you get out too.  Get a lot of therapy, when you think you’re okay, get more therapy. 

Also, sometimes in order to help your siblings, just be able to help them when they’re older so do and become the best you can be for you for now."
