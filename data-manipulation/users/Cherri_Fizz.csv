tumblr,ff0yjzc,t1_ff0uw0z,1579473533.0,"So apparently, any man who likes to wear women's clothing is transphobic now? Drag queens are cancelled, I guess. Also, ""people feel dysphoria just by looking at him"" is the most stupid ""argument"" that I've seen in a while. You have absolutely no evidence proving that statement, and the concept of someone seeing a man wearing feminine clothing/breaking gender conformity and feeling dysphoric about it is a wildly ridiculous and generalizing statement.

I legitimately have no idea what you're trying to say in some of your sentences, either. ""People's views of him ring very transphobic"" can either mean ""people think angel is transphobic"" or ""most people talking about him are transphobic"" and I have no idea which one you mean."

tumblr,fewn0yr,t1_fewmssn,1579415264.0,"Tumblr has been digging up old and out of context rumors that vivzie drew pedophilia and beastiality. What they don't say is that the ""pedophilia"" was an NSFW drawing of a 19x23 year old when she was 16 and the ""beastiality"" were two stick figure drawings in the tiny corner of an art stream as a joke.

And let's not forget the blatant lies on there like, ""Angels character is transphobic"" or ""this show supports homophobia"" or ""vaggie is a racist stereotype"" which can all be debunked if they just watched the episode or learned more about the characters."

tumblr,few4k47,t1_fevtllf,1579405259.0,"Honestly, same. Hazbin seems like it would be a great show (despite it's obvious flaws and rumors of the creator), but I feel like her spinoff short, Helluva Boss, will be way more successful than her passion project. She accepted critiques from people reviewing Hazbin and applied those new tips to Helluva, making Helluva a much better pilot and making it much more likely for it to be picked up by a company like adult swim (which is what she hopes will happen to Hazbin)."
delusionalartists,few32q4,t1_few1913,1579404746.0,"Jesus fucking Christ, my dude. You're overreacting on the situation. This kid is just an aspiring artist trying to sell their 'art' on sites like how they saw the professionals do. Every artist used to have that stage where they would open overpriced commissions when their art still needed some work. Children are very experienced in technology, so it could be likely that the kid made their own etsy account or is using their own parents account (most likely) instead of begging their parents to let them sell art. 

This, ""they're selling art on a site where people can be assholes, so that gives me the moral right to be an absolute shitbag to this child!"" idea that you have is downright disgusting and delusional. Instead of publicly shaming a random 5 year old online, maybe email them or their parents and tell them that they should stick to actual art commission sites so they have a bigger chance to sell their art (which will make them happy and motivate them to improve as an artist, even if they sold it for a dollar) and recieve ACTUAL criticism on how to improve their art.


Tldr; I think you're an asshole and should take a break from your computer before thinking it's ok to publicly shame toddlers"
