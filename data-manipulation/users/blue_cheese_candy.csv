Whatcouldgowrong,ffn4e8b,t1_ffjioe5,1580061960.0,"No what I am saying is that if any living thing on earth becomes inconvenient we tend to get rid of it. I am ridiculing the idea that we like life form A (lion - there seems to be a specific set of people that would rather kill the people that happen to do large game hunting) and not life form B (rat - where we discuss using gene drive genetic editing or bombing Australian islands with poison to exterminate them). The hypocrisy becomes funnier when we drag plants, bacteria and other life into the discussion.

So clearly its pretty consistent, some people come up with some reason to want to kill some living thing, we dress it up in moral choices, but really i mean we still kill other people when we get a good enough reason, and in some countries the bar is pretty low for that. I take issue with people who are not included in the debate whining and imposing their views, in particular when those views are not generically consistent.

Game hunting is a form of entertainment, supports an industry, is regulated, and so on, while I can safely assume there are problems with it they way there are with so many things people do, I have other priorities and do not care to partake. I can certainly understand why people do it. I don't go around looking for things to get upset at in Africa given the amount of problems closer to home."

philosophy,ffilpgp,t3_etscqq,1579976876.0,"The argument is over simplified and so self negating. Self loathing is a choice, that I don't share. Existential nihilism is a false premise.

If reducing the environmentalist argument to a scientific cause, it comes down to the efficiency of energy transfer systems. Homo Sapiens are the only animal species that consume more energy per specimen than our natural biological metabolic process allow.

It started with fire, by cooking food we are transferring the energy stored in the fuel source to the food, then came animal husbandry (raising animal for labor and food), mills and machines, to full blown industrial machines.

The problem is that no energy transfer system is 100% efficient, even at 99% its an issue of scale, there are simply too many people. So we pick winners and losers in the ecosystem that benefit from the wasted 1%. Nowadays we seem to be loving trees (the whole CO2 thing), but im sure sooner or later someone will discover that an oxygen rich atmosphere is just as problematic on its own merits (giant insects aren't furry and cuddly)

Progress is not defined by regression to a pre-fire state, or maintaining a steady state, it is rather the balanced advancement of all factors. Those environmental factors are always at a natural imbalance and the ecosystem is subject to change on its own with or without human interference.

Flying salmon in helicopters over a mudslide, is just plain stupid. That's not helping anything.  Our self loathing makes us want to just take ourselves out of the equation, i suggest a more optimist approach where you grab life by the balls and simply seek to maximize our control over the ecosystem. The ability to will solutions into existence by inserting ourselves as observers into the natural order is a strong argument for consciousness, I am a big subscriber to the idea that scientific progress holds the key to solving today's problems rather than some regressive environmentalist ideology that wants to take us backward to a pre-fire animal state."

So yes when I detect a down side: when an information news source provides negative value on multiple occasions, I fix it. I just thought others may be interested in an often overlooked feature of google news. I happen to believe that Americans will have a much healthier political relationship among themselves if they exercised more free will and discretion over what they read. The inherent bias in the US news media is not helping the situation.

""We"" don't have to work toward anything other than forming our own opinion. Don't drag me into whatever you find negative and i won't do the reverse, my conclusions and experiences are not yours and if we happen to agree on something, that's great, but some abstract activism about an issue that neither of us really has any experience with or particular direct impact in the outcome is probably best left as informational. More data, less anecdote story.

I am of the opinion this sort of thing has been going on forever in US government, I didn't think you could fart in a liberal democracy without back-room deals and garnering political support from various senators, congresspeople, etc... so really the sensationalism of the articles is unwarranted.

This specific political pattern, I noticed it when Clinton decided to bomb Serbia over Kosovo in more or less the same stencil situation. It's sad how so many people people that invest so much attention in following politics have the memory of goldfish."

So no thanks to this link. the huffingpost and NYTimes are both on my list. I don't care how true a given article is, a news source with an agenda to consistently upset you rather than inform you is not news. 5 strikes of making me angry and you are off the list.

Showerthoughts,fe93zwd,t3_eo38iu,1578933956.0,"But the time (relative to our place in the universe) before you were born is currently understood to be finite. The time after you die is only speculative.

So technically it is not true that there was an eternity before you were born. At the very least the clock started ticking at the ""let the be light"" or the first spark of quantum energy (h) which would have required the emergence of time for the current laws of physics to hold.

Given the amount of time spent into looking at quantum mechanics, big-bang, universe and all that. I'd say quite a number of people are pretty damn obsessed with the time that occurred before being born.

As a matter of fact, I don't really care what happens after i die. I can only anticipate the future in the context of the past."

You may want to look into self awareness, the brain is hardly self aware. Your notion of self is contained in a puny portion of the organ tissue. Some of the smarter instances of human brain have tried to study this and still only \~5% is toward cognitive activities, not knowing what the other 95% is up to can hardly be called ""aware""

A typical ""self awareness"" test involves holding up a mirror/model back at you and being able to link up the parallel unique identifiers between your self identity and presented model. We are just starting to scratch the surface on that with some of the neural network models, AI will probably be the first real mirror we get into the mind. but that will take still at least over a decade to become remotely a representative model of how a human brain works, never mind a mirror for a specific individual."

personalfinance,fdma8gr,t3_elshda,1578543728.0,"Don't spend more money than you have.

Make sure the sum of all your monthly credit card balances is not more than the amount of after bills cash you have.

A credit card bill is exactly that, a bill, it needs to be paid in time and in full along with your heat and your mortgage

There are fundamental economic reasons why you want to have as much of your own cash on you as immediately as possible without going to negative net worth.

Other than that, It is good advice to have different cards for different purposes, some give extra rewards for specific purchases, some stores give you a discount if you use their store credit card (and those tend to have the absolute APR so make sure you pay them off in time and in full), others have good travel insurance, etc...

So in order to maximize your financial gain from a transaction, multiple credit card options make sense, however 14 is absurd, and all the rest of the math in the comment is superfluous.

Just pay the balance off in full every statement. If you need to carry a credit balance to make ends meet, consider a personal line of credit from the bank, an asset secured one against your house or car is also likely to have a much lower interest.

Credit that you cannot pay off immediately should not be used towards luxury consumable goods, and should be used for necessities of life only in case of emergency."
