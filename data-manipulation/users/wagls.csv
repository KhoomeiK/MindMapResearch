AskReddit,fdts94p,t1_fdtrqrq,1578721400.0,Nah that was that crazy Moody woman who said that about the firefighters. She isn't greens affiliated either and Larissa Waters actually put out a statement very quickly staying she wasn't greens affiliated. A lot of rubbish gets attributed to the greens but doesn't actually have anything to do with them.
AskReddit,fdtlwfa,t1_fdtjrhj,1578718657.0,"The protests weren't specifically greens supporters though, just environmental activists.  The greens supports hazard reduction burning as one of their policies. Do you mind linking me to the circular quay comment? I've tried googling but to no avail."

TrollCoping,fdgcpmx,t1_fdffq2a,1578390400.0,"Yes holy shit, this. All my exes have been emotionally stunted af and i am now since dating a man who is incredibly emotionally intelligent. So often I find myself struggling to be supportive when he needs emotional support because I've never been allowed to be vulnerable myself so I don't understand how to deal with vulnerability. I'm doing him a disservice emotionally just because I was taught that being vulnerable equalled being embarrassing."
