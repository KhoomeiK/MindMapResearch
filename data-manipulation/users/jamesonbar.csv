goldenknights,ffraz9y,t3_eurkk5,1580154286.0,Blues fan here. How you guys like the Wolves as your AHL. I hated them as ours. They dictated who was coach and style of play. Only got to pick coach for 1 year and it was our best year for prospects. None of our top prospects even played for them and mostly turned out 3-4th liners if that. For longest time we could only supply them one goalie. They had good chunk of the roster as AHL only contracts.

hockey,ffg7o5u,t1_ffg4r80,1579900229.0,That might be true but the NHL is a older person sport. It's a niche sport that will probably be 5th in popularity by end of 20s. Unless baseball fucks up.  Sad that the NHL fan base has a meltdown if a player makes 6 mil cause he's maybe not worth it but in other sports that equivalent to a 2 mil player in NHL. To me NHL is way to conservative in the way it operates. Yea they got teams in the south and what not. It's only popular in those towns. I live near KCMO and it's almost non existent here.

NHL was on par or more popular in the 90s then basketball but failed to capitalize on it.

NHL has by far the worst marketing out of the major sports. They are so far out of it when it comes to popular culture. You can tell the sport is ran by 60 year old white guys who still believe that your product alone is good enough. I have asked my non hockey fan to name 5 players and they can only name 2 4 if you count retired players.  You shouldn't have to google when shit is.
