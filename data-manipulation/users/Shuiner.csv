BodyAcceptance,felnwqb,t3_enoq0a,1579226686.0,"I know this post is already a few days old, but still wanted to share my thoughts.

I've definitely felt majorly resentful. It's completely true that fat shaming is worse. Just look at any video on Reddit where someone in the video is fat. Every comment will be a fat joke. It's rough.

I suggest you Let your friends know that you don't want to hear then complain about their bodies. That it upsets you to hear it. If they are really your friends, they should understand. It's a messed up social norm in our society that women feel the need to constantly criticize themselves. But my friends understood when I said I didn't appreciate it, and I'm sure yours will too.

I think what helped me move past this feelings is realizing that their more socially-acceptable bodies did not guarantee them happiness, love, success, or any of the things I thought it did. I thought I would never get those things because of my body, but therapy and a lot of work proved me wrong. Meanwhile, some of the most conventionally attractive women I know still struggle. It can still be difficult when you see people being treated better by strangers, but I try to remember that being valued for your body alone is shallow and not genuine. At least I know the people around me really like me as a person."
gatesopencomeonin,feke8f2,t1_fek3zag,1579198207.0,"I've never been shamed, but patronizing comments happen all the time!

I exercise regularly, but I travel for work, so often I'm at new gyms in new cities. I get people giving me unwanted and unwelcome advice as to how to exercise for weight loss, or telling me they are inspired by me taking the step to exercise, or even asking me what my goal weight is. 

Like wtf?! The assumption that I must be new to exercise and it must be a really big deal because I'm fat, and that I must be trying to lose weight because I'm exercising, is just patronizing. The unwanted advice just makes it clear that they don't approve of my body, so they assume I don't either. That can have the same effect as fat shaming."

ABoringDystopia,fe52boo,t3_engtvy,1578865069.0,"To be fair, sales tax is owed by those who buy things on Amazon, not Amazon itself. 

The issue is whether Amazon should be required to collect sales tax, which it has started doing in many states. Physical stores must collect sales tax, while many online store do not. 

Saying they avoided sales tax is just false. The people who shopped on Amazon are the ones who avoided sales tax.

Most people see it as a perk when they aren't charged sales tax online. But it obviously is bad for state coffers."

sleep,fdk2ztm,t3_els4v1,1578494804.0,"You don't make up for lost sleep. The best thing you can do is stay up without napping so you'll hopefully fall sleep at a better time. Keep waking up at 6:30-7, even on weekends, and wait for your body to reset itself to those times. 

If you are consistent, you may be a little sleep deprived in the short term, but long term, it'll help you get consistently good sleep.
