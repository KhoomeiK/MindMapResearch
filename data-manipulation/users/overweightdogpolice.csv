Dogtraining,fe9or2v,t1_fe9lfiy,1578940088.0,"That's a good start!! I would see if you can get him to do those on the first try, treat him like a puppy and start from square one if he needs a little more direction. 


Helpful too for walks and reacting on leash: teach him focus/look at me (pick your fave word and watch a YouTube video on how to teach this) so you can draw his attention away from the thing he reacts to. That should help shape a more positive behavior instead of barking (and being stressed out). 


If you can find his favorite motivator it will be easier. Maybe this is food, a ball/toy, or affection."
Dogtraining,fe9l96v,t3_eo5z8s,1578939005.0,"I see a lot of really good comments about desensitizing, which is perfect. But how is his obedience training? 


Obedience is the foundation of all training, starting a desensitizing protocol is great! But if he doesn't know what you want him to do.... desensitizing him might not go as quickly as you'd like it, especially if he doesn't know what you are asking him to do (sitting quietly instead of barking). 


Basically my recommendation is to teach a preferred behavior (like ""sit on your bed"") as opposed to the behavior you don't want (""bark like a madman"")."
OpenDogTraining,fdr8c08,t3_emr2io,1578680890.0,"To answer your question succinctly: two dogs are twice the trouble. Sometimes twice as cute, but always twice as much dog to manage. 


This other dog sounds like an accident that has already happened, several times unfortunately. Your friend should never visit the dog park again without a muzzle. I'm surprised the authorities haven't been called on this dog if it's the third time he's attacked/bitten another dog in the same park."
dogs,fdnv7n5,t3_emc9ys,1578593515.0,See if you can pick up an Elizabethan Collar/Cone for her until she sees the vet! That looks painful and she is probably scratching at it. I would also gently wash it with baby soap and clean water. She will feel better after going to the vet.
IAmA,fdnsmnp,t3_emb3u8,1578592016.0,"Do you have any advice for establishing and maintaining boundaries, politely, with a boundary resistant/pushy parent? Maybe some keywords or techniques to use. 

For example: I say ""we are not available on Saturday"" this leads to a million questions from aforementioned boundary pusher: ""what are you doing? You don't want the family together? What about mother's day/Martin Luther King day/other random holiday/birthday? Whats wrong? You won't see other family either?"""

AgeGapRelationship,fdnhazo,t1_fdnfz2l,1578585796.0,"Her skin looks great tbh. She could drop a bit of weight but you also could've worded that a little more constructively like ""he looks younger because he has a huge giddy smile on his face and looks like he works out a bit"""
dogs,fdkkijb,t1_fdkimbz,1578505499.0,Best of luck! Hopefully she gets to keep her tail club
dogs,fdj3aqh,t3_elmu5h,1578457312.0,"Vet can rule out and yeast/fungus/mange/fleas etc very quickly.  That's the first line of treatment, after you get that ruled out...I'd look into changing to a food with a single protein source, as meat proteins are the most common allergy, followed by corn, wheat, soy. I like good ole Purina and also Nature's Variety food."
dogs,fdj2lcw,t3_elllb2,1578456808.0,"Ok, it looks stupid. But. Did you try making a sling for her tail like this-  https://www.featheredgems.com/blog/?p=292 

 If it's stupid and it works it's not stupid.

But if your dog is kindof less than brilliant like mine (and will eat the bandages, cause everything is a snack), please put a cone on her when she is unsupervised."
dogs,fde50pf,t1_fddja3s,1578331322.0,"I would reevaluate with the vet on day 4 if it was my dog. 

If he can made it through most of day 3 he is a strong puppy. Try to keep him calm and his environment comfortable and clean in the meantime.  It sounds like you love him very much. 

I have a rescue pup who survived parvo. It's possible your boy will make it too.

Has the vet suggeted anything else you can do to keep him comfortable?"
DoggyDNA,fcacikg,t1_fca5c1t,1577566759.0,"Agree about the dense fur. If anything - the fluffy coat will better conceal his body condition (either too skinny or too fat). Its just like wearing a sweater as opposed to a cotton shirt. 

 If you average the weight's of the purebreeds in his mix, you get a range of 38-56 pounds (I used Chow twice because Chows are the biggest breed in his mix, and OP says he's big boned). 

Now - averaging the weights in his breed mix isn't very scientific. That's why veterinarians use a condition score. A lower weight than 65 would be a good goal weight to discuss with the vet."
DoggyDNA,fc9s282,t3_egglv0,1577557361.0,"Lots of pitty breed guesses but I don't see to many brindle coated pits.


Boxer mix explains the head shape and maybe the brindle color. He would need a long coated gene from both parents iirc to have the long coat gene. So let's say Boxer, Pyrenees, Aussie...um Mastiff too"
DoggyDNA,fc9qqz3,t3_eglyv1,1577556781.0,She's gorgeous! Very healthy looking and muscular!
DoggyDNA,fc7g40h,t1_fc4kevj,1577506394.0,"He would feel so much younger without those extra pounds. Games of chase with his dog buds would be so much more fun. 


He shouldn't be Lab-sized, He's 50% smallish dog after all. Also not a Lab. You should be able to easily feel his ribs and see his waist tuck up toward his hind legs."
