Dogtraining,fdvoly5,t1_fdvcq7q,1578749735.0,"No need to get upset, puppies get worms, the vet will give you dewormer and have a fecal sample for. Both dogs tested to ID parasite type so they know what wormer to use. Like they said you need to deworm a few times to get all the worms. I have to deworm all my animals as horses are regularly dewormed, as are goats, and my cats get them from eating what they catch outside, and dogs from tasting everything to see if it is eatable. Tapeworm sheds in stool as white wiggly segments that look like white rice in the poop, hookworms can be seen as large light colored worms about 3 inches long . But even if you don’t see anything they should still be tested."

I just saw a post recently that showed a picture of a Congo father staring at his daughters limb that had been hacked off her to punish him for not meeting his harvest quota during Belgium Congo rule. He was certainly right about crimes against humanity, thank you for letting me know who to credit for the term. George Williams."

dogs,fcp7ft7,t1_f5qejpz,1577852984.0,"I worked as a horse person for decades  and not to change is not to have an open mind. I worked in breeding TB racehorses until
I knew enough then I got out of it even though the farm gave very good care. Ethically I could no longer do a job I loved. But I found workable alternatives and got into draft horse work logging and harrowing etc. My Big Bud loved his job and I loved working with him. We teamed with another guy who lost one of his team and did hay , logging carting and spreading . He enjoyed working with Charley,  it was a pleasure to see how they got along. I have Picts of him and you can see he is happy by his head and ears, he loved driving Santa through town at Christmas, he loved the attention and pats plus ungodly amount of candy canes. He was a peppermint fanatic. He did a lot of different things and was always game for it. I never forced anything and he  loved to work."
dogs,fcp64ny,t1_f5qibda,1577851720.0,"They did and came with written guarantees and health records and checks . I took them to my vet first thing and all were clearly ok, he agreed with the health checks , I always get my guy to make sure whether horses or dogs as it is too much emotional and financial invested in animals to risk. Again you need to assess the source of any animal."
dogs,fcp5k7k,t1_f5r4exz,1577851174.0,"Yes Sam Smucker, I saw two very poised confident driving ponies and they both were trained by him. So I gave him my horse to back (school to saddle) . He is very good. I like he can cross train and not lose any skill the horse has in either harness or under saddle. Horses have confidence in traffic and in company as well."

Permaculture,fcp30vq,t1_fbyacj2,1577848921.0,"Well I have someone renting my old homestead but I still am not done with it. I want to put in another swale and plant more fruit trees as the fruit trees planted years ago by a former owner died as he planted them in a bad low area and they suffered for it. Like to place them properly and replace berry bushes a contractor destroyed. Backed right over them just as they were getting large enough to give a decent harvest. Pheonixville area is nice for enviro minded people , my area is more Trump country so not many permaculture people that I know of. One guy has 90 acres and he is interested. But I am much smaller with 4 acres but my new tenants are gun ho to get the place healthy again so here’s hoping for the new year."

MadeMeSmile,fc4n934,t1_fc4gjhq,1577421751.0,When I got my first golden a pup when he was older I realized how well that worked out for him. He loved her so much and helped to teach her everything. It was a May December romance. I have always kept two dogs at least since then since I saw quickly how much they love to live as a pack if you have the room and the money.

camping,fc3h3cg,t1_fc2jzwk,1577389656.0,I have one of those ground sheets that is Mylar on one side and red tarp on the other. I put that down under my tent and I think it helps but maybe just fooling myself. I got it as a multi use piece of gear as it has grommets and is 7 by 9 open full. I never used it as such but thought it would reflect a campfire heat well if needed. My setup plus big dog keeps me warm without it as I don’t do extreme type stuff. A little snow is fine but I don’t have a truly winter tent. I think I would jump right to truck camper like those insulated fiberglass jobs with heaters. My knees and back are so bad the amount of padding between me and the ground required has become pretty thick.
camping,fc3fgvu,t1_fc2prcz,1577388635.0,"I have a super wide 2 inch thermo and I take a heavy wool horse blanket and flip so the outer water proof is on the ground and the wool  is up. Makes for a fantastic rug for the whole tent. The dog can be comfy anywhere and then all I need is my winter bag and a hat. If hammocking I use the same blanket strapped to the bottom of the hammock same wide sleeping mat in the hammock and bag. I love sleep with my nose tingling from the cold but every other body part toasty warm. Haven’t Winter camped like that for a few years, as I have been ill. Hope to do it again. A clear winters night full of stars and hot cocoa is a type of heaven to me."

She sees me before or after Xmas I hoped this year would be different, she at least called but  now I don’t rate the day. Xmas eve and day are for her rich in-laws parties. I called her at nine pm and she made excuses then said she was sorry they got busy. She has lots of friends .
I have a dog. And breast cancer."
