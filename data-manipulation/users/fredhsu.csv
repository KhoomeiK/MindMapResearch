wikipedia,feyqqjf,t1_few4489,1579449325.0,"I used to upload better pictures from better equipment when I was able to lug around such things. Now I just take pictures I think can be useful to wikipedia whenever opportunities present themselves. I even call my vacations iPhone Wiki Vacations now ;)

The key is the upload. Millions of people take interesting pictures every hour. Few upload anything to commons.

I took this picture as I stepped out of work, into a sea of tourists occupying that intersection. No car could move for about ten minutes. I took this picture to commemorate. 

Of all pictures taken that day, or subsequent years, or elsewhere at other intersections, Wiki Media has only my sucky phone picture. Someone else should take a better one and replace mine."
wikipedia,feypj34,t1_feu36ft,1579448756.0,"Ha ha. That is exactly my experience. I took this picture OP posted. I walked out of the building I was working then, and stepped into an intersection occupied by tourists. I took this picture in awe to commemorate this silly activity :)"
wikipedia,feyp9vs,t1_fewazgm,1579448570.0,"Exactly. I am with you, dude. 

It was a quite a sight. Actually more than a thousand people were there just within one block radius of the intersection you saw in this picture. Tens of thousands of lame pictures were captured that day just within the eyesight of this picture.

But exactly one lame phone photographer uploaded this lame picture to commemorate this silly human activity on Wikipedia. 

We need better and more topic-appropriate pictures in Wikimedia. 

You want to help?"
wikipedia,fetfdbf,t3_eqii9c,1579374893.0,"Great picture of the phenomenon. And I mean the crowd, not so much the sun :)

I wonder who took that picture in 2016 ;)"

But pretending that these are more appropriate first answer than “gradual changes over geological time” is disingenuous."
evolution,fdfik04,t1_fddvpaa,1578362526.0,"OP has the heart in the right place, but not the right argument. You pointed out the right argument in your last paragraph. OP wrote a lot. But these are not useful. I don't understand what the essay is supposed to do. There is already plenty of books on this topic for anyone who cares about it. Climbing Mount Improbable and The Blind Watchmaker come to mind."
evopsych,fc21avm,t1_fc0foqd,1577336520.0,"I just re-read what I wrote. When I wrote ""remained close"", I didn't meant physical distance. I meant relationally close. In today's world, people can remain relationally close, and face-chat daily over the net half way across the globe. People living in the same household may not exchange one single word for days, even though they are physically close.

What I've curiously observed for decades is that females remain intimate with their birth families. Married females naturally draw their spouses into their birth families and extended birth families. The same cannot usually be said of males. This is despite the fact that in many countries females marry physically into males' family residence.

I don't know whether my empirical observations is an indication of pre-agricultural human behavior (aka matriarchy), or a result of married females perceiving themselves as being forced into an alien ecosystem (thus the resentment towards the alien family).

Perhaps if the circumstances are reversed, and young men marry into brides' families, then the opposite behavior would be observed. That is, men will in general not get along with their father-in-law, and will try to draw their wives into their own birth families."
