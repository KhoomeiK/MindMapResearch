AskReddit,fdt0dn7,t1_fdrt0ho,1578710292.0,"It’s funny because the thread immediately reminded me of a specific time i was at a somewhat upscale restaurant and a probably 4 yr old was running around the dining area, crawling under random people’s tables, trying to talk to people, and getting under the servers’ feet, with no sign of an adult watching him at all.  The servers were furious because he almost tripped one of them with a tray of food. We finally figured out the kid seemed to belong to a guy eating by himself who was just chilling with his phone while his kid terrorized the restaurant. It was so egregious we assumed he was like the owner or something but he finally finished up, paid, and left. Only time I’ve seen it that bad, though a few dinners with family/friends’ little kids came pretty close unfortunately. I definitely wouldn’t say it’s common except maybe at explicitly kid oriented restaurants but it definitely happens."
