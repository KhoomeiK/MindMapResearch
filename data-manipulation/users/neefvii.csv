AskReddit,fgjs1qm,t3_eyskct,1580850272.0,"Grew up in the 80s and 90s. Family and church put a ton of emphasis on striving towards perfection.  
Anytime I accomplished something, I was expected to analyze it on how to do/be better. For next time.

Games didn't ask that. When I won or completed a game, they just said ""Good Job!"" or ""Thanks for Playing"" or ""Congratulations"".  
No anxiety of not-quite-enough or again-but-this-time-try-to-look-happy.

I enjoyed the end of a story or journey that I helped create.

Sure, I'll sometimes try to be better at a particular game, but it's because I want to; Not because a looming authority figure demands it."
