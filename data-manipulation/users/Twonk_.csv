Velo,ff5o7lu,t1_ff5o244,1579602868.0,Oh yeah! Don't get me wrong. Strava is great! The social part is really fun but the training part ain't that deep. Strava is a real great app!
Velo,ff5ncfz,t1_ff5mu7r,1579601556.0,Okay. All that I'm saying is why can't I analyze my data that I gathered without paying extra? Strava really falls short when it comes to free features that can actually be helpful for your training and not just seeing where uncle Frank fucking drank beer with the boys this weekend.
Velo,ff5mqym,t1_ff5l7uq,1579600645.0,"No. Not directly. I'm paying for training peaks so I can plan my workouts. If I stopped paying I'd still have the power analyzing feature. I have a power meter and I record the numbers why would I be able to analyze my hr and speed but not my power? Power graphs should be a free feature, and that's not the reason I'm paying training peaks."
Velo,ff5hjmo,t1_ff5hcow,1579593164.0,"That's not what I mean. Analyzing power should be a standard feature. Training peaks, wahoo app and rotor app has it why doesn't Strava have it?"
Velo,ff5dfpn,t3_erq88a,1579588266.0,Let me analyze my fucking power without paying extra for summit. I already have to pay trainingpwaks and zwift my power meter was quite an investment and now I can't use Strava to analyze my numbers?

Velo,ff04d0n,t1_ff03tjg,1579465072.0,I have a tacx flux which claims to be darn spot on. Could definitely try that one. But I've read that my rotor 2in power is a but high indoors because the bracket flexes a bit more and the left censor is in the spindle itself or something.

Velo,fezox78,t1_fezlt7b,1579459830.0,That 202 is the headtube hight. Your stem isn't on there. Measure it. Your size is definitely not a 58 and your stem is probably a stock 110 or so. Measure your top tube and your stem. Not that this could be fixed with a different seatpost and stem because that bike isn't the right size man...
Velo,fezodn6,t1_fezlmab,1579459647.0,Measure the top tube length. The bill could be wrong right...
