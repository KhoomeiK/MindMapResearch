3yrs later and I had a 6 figure year.

But starting out I went 4-6 weeks at a time with no work and had to be ready to leave to another state with less than 12hr notice and sometimes 0 notice just "" pack up let's go""  Also I've spent 30+hrs working, putting in a 16hr day then getting a call for a cut cable while eating now we have to drive 4 hrs there and back for a grand total of 30+ with boots on and attention focused.  Then you're doing 12-20 hr days for as long as you can to make the deadline because it's always the last step that gets the big wigs in a rush - doesn't matter that every step prior took 3x longer than needed the splicers ALWAYS get the time pressure.

If you can tough it out with a contractor that has work it's definitely worth it - he makes a dime every time I make a dollar so it works out well for everyone.

To find someone to work for use your current connections as they know you're worth a shit.

As for finding someone try asking the big Telecom Co in your nearest big metro - might take a few people passing you to others before you get someone that actually has contractor contact info but if you're polite and persistent they are available and typically travel regularly which is why it's so expensive to hire them.  I've got random calls this way to test a cable that potentially got damaged or move a switch to the other side of a server room."
FiberOptics,fdqy7hc,t3_emt9os,1578676611.0,"Start with with a light source and light power meter, there are charts that tell you expected loss per splice and connector.  Also your vendor for your equipment can usually help recommend typical light levels for operation.

The expensive and detailed testing will need an otdr which will tell you exactly where your issues are and if they are bad splices or tight bends.

Also you might get lucky and clean you connectors/ports to fix everything.

I wouldn't think you'd need a vfl(red light) as you know the path is correct and working.

My best advice - find an experienced local contract fiber splicer and pay him $1k spend a day trouble shooting WHILE teaching/explaining the process.  Bill it as hiring a consultant and then you're set with a stack of notes and numbers and equipment needed for future reference/maintenance."

3yrs later and I had a 6 figure year.

But starting out I went 4-6 weeks at a time with no work and had to be ready to leave to another state with less than 12hr notice and sometimes 0 notice just "" pack up let's go""  Also I've spent 30+hrs working, putting in a 16hr day then getting a call for a cut cable while eating now we have to drive 4 hrs there and back for a grand total of 30+ with boots on and attention focused.  Then you're doing 12-20 hr days for as long as you can to make the deadline because it's always the last step that gets the big wigs in a rush - doesn't matter that every step prior took 3x longer than needed the splicers ALWAYS get the time pressure.

If you can tough it out with a contractor that has work it's definitely worth it - he makes a dime every time I make a dollar so it works out well for everyone.

To find someone to work for use your current connections as they know you're worth a shit.  Hound everyone you can think of for just a phone call/foot in the door and if you get a number keep asking them if they need help until they tell you ""I'll call you"" or stop answering.

FiberOptics,fdrbvs8,t1_fdraibg,1578682287.0,"Try all the vendors really, cold being a factor might be poor setup (not allowing expansion/contraction)

As for finding someone try asking the big Telecom Co in your nearest big metro - might take a few people passing you to others before you get someone that actually has contractor contact info but if you're polite and persistent they are available and typically travel regularly which is why it's so expensive to hire them.  I've got random calls this way to test a cable that potentially got damaged or move a switch to the other side of a server room."
FiberOptics,fdqy7hc,t3_emt9os,1578676611.0,"Start with with a light source and light power meter, there are charts that tell you expected loss per splice and connector.  Also your vendor for your equipment can usually help recommend typical light levels for operation.

The expensive and detailed testing will need an otdr which will tell you exactly where your issues are and if they are bad splices or tight bends.

Also you might get lucky and clean you connectors/ports to fix everything.

I wouldn't think you'd need a vfl(red light) as you know the path is correct and working.

My best advice - find an experienced local contract fiber splicer and pay him $1k spend a day trouble shooting WHILE teaching/explaining the process.  Bill it as hiring a consultant and then you're set with a stack of notes and numbers and equipment needed for future reference/maintenance."
