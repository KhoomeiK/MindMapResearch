AmItheAsshole,ffc3olu,t3_essqqi,1579790759.0,"NTA she basically spat in your face on this one. And you have way more you should be angry about as well in my opinion. 

Any parent who goes for the low blow ""just like your [other parent]"" line or just generally insults their child is a total POS in my book. My mom tried something similar and it was six months before I said another word to her let alone started healing the relationship. 

You sound like an excellent person and a very kind one at that. I would recommend letting your mother know that you rescind your offer and telling her exactly why and doing so calmly. It may help to write down exactly what you want to say so she can't derail you."
AmItheAsshole,ffc2mwt,t3_essr02,1579790002.0,"NTA your partner should not be trying to control the people you spend time with. It's not like you two were fucking, you were playing a card game.

AmItheAsshole,ffb4him,t3_esnmph,1579751562.0,"NTA. You can't be an asshole for just saying something that's true. Anyone who would break up with a person over something as trivial as a quilt, especially a quilt with such significant meaning to their partner, would not be worth dating. Or even being friends with for that matter given that I'm sure that attitude does not start nor end with dating and hookups only."

AmItheAsshole,fewj12w,t1_fewb570,1579411536.0,"Humanity has forgotten how to talk to strangers? What kind of boomer nonsense are you on about? 

Just because someone doesn't want to talk doesn't make them out of touch or socially inept. Especially on mass transit where most people are tired and just want to go home. The OP was also giving very clear ""I don't want to talk right now"" signals. And the stranger still persisted. The stranger did the equivalent of interrupting someone reading a book or sleeping. Same concept.

Also ""Back in the day""? You do know that people still have to meet the strangers they find on dating apps right? Like they don't just exist as text on a phone forever."

AmItheAsshole,feewaj5,t3_eos6j1,1579042592.0,"YTA all the way. Invading someone's privacy for any reason is how you lose a relationship on easy mode. It doesn't take a family therapist to see that all she wanted was a mother figure and for someone to take an interest in her life. That's all *any* teen wants. It's important to keep it in moderation as well so you don't become a helicopter parent.

Also through the diary, at least based on what you told us, you learned nothing that she wouldn't have told you or her father. Take this as a chance to do better in the future and *never* do it again."
AmItheAsshole,feeutal,t3_eos7je,1579041683.0,"YTA. Even if you were at a table of native English speakers, that ""joke"" would not have been funny. I find it very hard to believe that everyone at the table laughed. In the absolute best circumstances it can be considered just an unfunny comment but all you did was say something racist and expect people to laugh. It wasn't even like a racist joke where sometimes it could be considered ""dark humor"" you were just overtly racist."
