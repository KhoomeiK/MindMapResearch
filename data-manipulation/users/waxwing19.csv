dogs,ffgiwtn,t3_etfddb,1579907279.0,"I’d go to the vet to ensure that nothing is physically wrong. As others have said, sodium or parasites or diabetes might be the cause. But I know a large breed that will drink water (very messy, it goes everywhere) and drink so much so fast that he cough-vomits it up. His owners had to invest in a ‘slow drinking’ bowl to prevent it. He still drank the same amount, but he wasn’t chugging it so fast that it upset his belly."
dogs,ffgd61r,t3_ethc2e,1579903608.0,"If you guys can commit to taking a few formal training classes together (because you need to use the same consistent method, and because the dog would benefit a lot from puppy and basic classes), I’d say that a golden would align with what you’ve described. They’re natural people-pleasers, they have some energy that needs to be worked off, they’re excellent dogs for learning tricks, they’re gentle but large enough to dissuade attackers. What you might struggle with is ‘calm’ with visitors, especially when the dog is young. And, as with nearly any breed, the first 1-3 years is going to be full of crazy puppy energy and teenage defiance."
dogs,ffd0aac,t3_esyce1,1579810891.0,"If the last person to own him encouraged him by vocalizing during playtime, it could be him telling you “omg let’s keep playing come on”. Dogs jump, bark and play-bite when they’re eager to play, although some dogs push too hard and can’t judge when to stop. The best way to cope with this is to cross your arms, stand up and turn away. If the dog persists, leave the room and shut the door. Give him time to calm down, then try again. Also, teach yourself to read the signs that your dog is giving you, and stop playing before it reaches the crazy-jumping-and-barking stage."
dogs,ffclrwx,t3_esv0qz,1579802161.0,"Yes. My dog was neutered a little over two weeks ago, and he doesn’t seem to have noticed that his balls are gone. Follow the vet’s instructions for keeping the incision clean, don’t let your dog do anything too physical for 10 days, and it’s clear sailing."

dogs,ffckm68,t3_esw0ag,1579801462.0,"Oof, definitely don’t go for a giant schnauzer! They’re great dogs, but that’s like trying to walk a tightrope before you know how to walk on solid ground, and the dog will be the one to suffer for your mistakes. Contrary to a lot of stereotypes, most breeds will do great on hikes; the ones that won’t are giant breeds (mastiffs, etc.) and brachycephalic breeds (pugs, etc.). What you’ve described is not adequate for an athletic or high-energy breed. Your lifestyle is suitable for a low-energy breed, or an older adult dog."
dogs,ffcjtls,t3_esw6gg,1579800983.0,"Stop trying to make eye contact, don’t reach over her to pet her (reach under and pet under her muzzle/neck), don’t bend over (crouch down to her level), throw high-value treats in her direction, ignore her most of the time, let her sniff at you and approach you without acknowledging her, try not to speak loudly or in a deep tone of voice (try that embarrassing high-pitched girly tone in a soft way), and be the one who takes her to a training class. Hopefully there’s a positive-reinforcement class for nervous dogs in your area... they’re usually only available in cities, unfortunately. Dogs tend to shy away from men more than women and children, so you’ve got your work cut out for you, but it sounds like you’re on the right track. Don’t try to push things too fast; she needs opportunities to observe you without being engaged, and trying to play/pet her while she’s uncomfortable will only drive her away."

dogs,ffazyqy,t1_ffaxh7p,1579748415.0,"You need to get her as much attention as possible. Sadie sounds like a sweet girl, but realistically, she is a pit-mix with a history of attacking other dogs and being reactive around strangers. You need to be up-front about these issues, and you cannot rehome her to a family with other pets and young children, which significantly cuts down the number of suitable homes.

Everyone who reaches out with an interest in Sadie will be a stranger, and it's your job to learn who is trustworthy and who is not. Don't let social media scare you away. Just ask a lot of questions, conduct an interview and meet-and-greet, and ensure it's a home where nobody could get hurt."
dogs,ff83sfl,t3_es3qod,1579665225.0,"Yes, and it’s a pain in the butt now that I have three dogs. They get one-on-one time away from the other dogs every day, usually training or walks, and making sure everyone has a fair amount of time has been tough. One of the dogs in particular gets mopey and lethargic if she isn’t given special attention, so I take her to weekly training classes and spend the hour with only her, giving her treats and praise... you can really see how she perks up. They take turns coming out to pet stores and parks with me."
dogs,ff5b15x,t1_ff5an1s,1579585756.0,"A couple of ideal traits is not impossible, but the combination of that many is. Narrow down your list - maybe you can tolerate a small breed dog that barks and has a high prey-drive, and you can fit in 30 minutes of extra on-leash exercise, but you require it to be dog- and child-friendly with a low-shedding coat. It’s nice that you’re thinking about all this now and giving yourself a lot of time to research."
dogs,ff5amvj,t3_erq6y5,1579585367.0,"I would never allow my dog to do that, no. I taught them not to jump in and out of vehicles - they have to wait for me to lift them - because someday they’ll be old and hurt themselves trying to do it. Dogs can really push themselves to their physical limit, and high jumps are unnecessary in most situations. It’s like letting my nephew jump off the fridge. Yeah, he CAN do it, but it’s silly to encourage, it’s pointless, and someday he’s going to really hurt himself doing it. I agree that extreme jumping isn’t ideal for the dog’s joints."
dogs,ff5aacp,t1_ff57h7s,1579585034.0,"You could get a large rug, lay it over a mattress protector, and set the playpen over that. It would ensure the urine wouldn’t reach the hardwood."
dogs,ff5a5xx,t3_erq05e,1579584914.0,"This isn’t a breed recommendation so much as an observation, so my apologies. But you’ve listed an awful lot of ideal traits... hypoallergenic, low energy, friendly but not overwhelming, quiet, good off-leash, equal parts snuggly and reserved, dog-friendly, uninterested in chewing, not a digger, child-friendly, low-cost, no prey-drive. And on top of all that, you’re hoping for a unique breed. The first thing to ask yourself is: why are popular breeds so popular? Everyone loves the idea of having a beautiful and unique dog, but people lean towards certain common breeds because they are the easiest fit for the average household. There’s a very good reason you don’t see akitas around often. The second question is: what are you willing to cut out of your ideal traits list? There will be a lot of compromising. The exercise you’ve listed, for example, is inadequate for even toy breeds; active dogs require daily exercise beyond the backyard. A maltese needs to get out of the backyard regularly, to say nothing of larger dogs. I don’t think that you’d be a bad dog owner, but I think you need to spend time around dogs and get some experience under your belt. Volunteer at an animal shelter and walk/play with some shelter dogs, if that’s possible. Get a feel for the reality of having a dog, both the good and bad parts, and see how difficult it can be to train those behaviors you desire. See what you can and cannot compromise on."

Dogs are a long-term commitment, and your college roommate might not be your roommate in 12 years, in which case who gets the dog? Whose dog is it if you’re paying 50/50? What happens when there’s a medical emergency and you want different treatments? Who takes the dog to training class? It seems like a really fun idea right now, I know, but even siblings can struggle with co-ownership, let alone a temporary roommate. If you both have the time, interest and energy for a dog, fostering could be very fulfilling and not tie you down for over a decade. Or look at a shorter-lived alternative like rats, which are remarkably dog-like and intelligent but only live ~3 years."

You have to get pretty creative to tackle the pent up energy.

Putting your own fear above your pet’s quality of life and long-term health is not fair. You’re damned if you don’t, but there’s a very real chance that you can make your dog’s life better (and longer) if you try. Did you see someone else’s comment about gabapentin? You seem extremely focused on the worst case scenarios and haven’t acknowledged the fact that your dog is getting regular brain damage, could experience organ failure due to the cluster seizures, and that cluster seizures every three weeks is not considered infrequent."

service_dogs,fev9b73,t1_fetxwjb,1579394670.0,"That's the point of a purebred, though. The vast majority of purebreds inherit certain behavioural traits. You don't see beagles herding sheep in Scotland, or grannies knitting sweaters next to their sedentary malinois. There are some interesting ongoing studies about the shape/function of brains in different breeds and the differences according to the dog's intended purpose. Most breeds have been developed over centuries with a focus on producing consistent physical and behavioural traits. It isn't a guarantee, but there are very few exceptions to those standards if you're buying from a responsible breeder. The chances of deviations are higher from backyard breeders and puppy mills that aren't being careful about their breeding stock."
service_dogs,fev1bpj,t3_eqk577,1579392007.0,"I'm a member of service dog groups here on Reddit, on Facebook, and in real life. There is definitely a push towards using purebreds, but offline it's easier to see the emotions and intentions behind that push. You can hear their voices and see their faces. That's impossible online, and some users are very poor at conveying emotion through text alone. But on this subreddit, there's one consistent truth with very few exceptions:

The push is for your benefit and the benefit of the SD community, and the person giving you that advice means very well. (Sometimes they just stink at wording it correctly.)

I haven't seen anyone suggest that mutts are ""lesser than"" purebred dogs, only that they're poorer candidates (higher wash-out rate, not complete inability to become service dogs) and can present unexpected challenges that purebreds generally do not. Mutts are great companions, and some mutts go on to become excellent service dogs.

People who advocate for responsibly-bred purebreds are saying that your dog came from a backyard breeder, yes. I haven't met a person who responsibly breeds mixes. I suppose some of the confusion stems from what you define as 'responsible breeding' versus what the experienced purebred community defines as 'responsible breeding'. If you're interested in knowing more about that, I'd be happy to lay things out.

There are some snots, but not as many as you'd think. Some of the examples you've listed do have a rhyme and reason behind them, not just ""ew your BYB mongrel is so bad lol"" (although I do see a couple of those too). Don't get discouraged! And don't allow a defensive attitude stand in the way of learning and getting good advice.

Edited to add: I'm not sure who your edit is pointing to, but no one on this thread has been a self-righteous ass. No one has called anyone else names or been aggressive. The only person being mean is you. Disagreeing with other people and explaining opinions is acceptable and encouraged; it isn't toxic or self-righteous. It's how we've learned from one another in this community, and how we continue to connect and help each other. Please don't throw around insults."

dogs,fesk9na,t1_fepvg5b,1579366110.0,"The chances of increased seizures while coming off a medication are dramatically reduced if you taper it off very slowly and don’t just stop within 24-48 hours. (I’ve been on 14 different meds so far.) Seizures every 3-4 weeks, especially cluster seizures, are going to take a toll on your dog’s quality of life, and the heat produced by cluster seizures (that you’ve mentioned in other posts) can result in organ damage and failure. You can monitor her kidney and liver function with regular blood tests once she’s on an anti-epileptic medication. Monthly seizures are pretty bad, and they will increase in number and grow worse if they’re allowed to continue like this."
Epilepsy,fesinqv,t3_eqiayi,1579365615.0,"Yeah, definitely. It probably isn’t the same as missing your kids, but I always worry about and miss my dogs.

dogs,fepltpt,t3_eqbpab,1579323894.0,"There isn’t as much information available on dog seizures as there is on humans. We don’t have the number of cases being monitored, the variety of medications and treatments, or the availability of things like EEGs to capture canine seizures. But speaking as a human with epilepsy who is part of epilepsy groups, yes, seizures can change a person’s behavior and personality and I imagine it’s similar with dogs. Each area of our brain serves a different purpose, and when an area is damaged, it ceases to function the way that it used to. Damage can become severe due to oxygen deprivation during grand mal seizures, repeated electrical disturbances in cluster seizures, and simply repeated seizures over time, which is why less frequent seizures is preferable than leaving it untreated. My memory has been impacted by my epilepsy, and my personality has also undergone some changes; I’m more anxious than I used to be, more easily frustrated, more emotionally fragile, and less attentive. Some vets suspect that dogs also experience partial seizures, which your dog might also be experiencing. There is a recovery period after a seizure that can last from hours to days, and can include fatigue, confusion, brain fog and headaches. Please reconsider speaking to your vet about medication."

That’s at the high end of collie energy, and I don’t believe most collies require that much exercise, thank goodness. But if you get an adult collie, you’ll need at least twice the amount of exercise you’ve listed here, or one daily walk with some weekly formal training classes and daily puzzles/training at home to make up for it with mental stimulation. A puppy will need more than that. They’re described as a less demanding herding breed, but you need to look at the dogs they’re being compared to... Australian shepherds, border collies, cattle dogs. Rough and smooth collies are still considered an active breed. If you’re set on the breed, I’d think about reaching out to a responsible breeder or collie rescue for a middle-aged dog instead of getting a puppy. (If you live in Canada, the Collie Rescue Network is amazing!) Breed rescues use long-term fosters that can give you honest feedback and information about the individuals, and many breeders have adult dogs that are retired from breeding, tested for a genetic problem that they don’t want to pass on to puppies, or were held back for show potential that never quite developed.

Double-check with management about whether it’s actually their patch of grass or not, just to be sure, but claiming it as their own and telling people not to walk on it is really silly.

You don’t know that the puppies your family friend breeds are healthy, quality dogs. And spend some time with your father’s friend, too, regardless of whether he’s the one you’ll buy a puppy from. Meet and spend time with his dogs, observe the way that he handles and trains them, ask questions about grooming and upkeep, take part in brushing and walking them.

An epilepsy group confirmed that my symptoms are indicative of seizures. Allowing absence seizures to continue without medical intervention can turn into grand mal seizures over time and cause irreparable brain damage. I NEED to see a neurologist. At worst, they’ll tell me that it’s psychological, but if I do have epilepsy and leave today without a referral, the worst case scenario is death.” My beloved godmother chuckled to me that GPs know a little about a lot of stuff, and specialists know a lot about a little, so don’t trust the GP who believes he’s a neurology expert.

dogs,fdovfdf,t1_fdorb5t,1578613765.0,"I'm a little skeptical of the suggestion to take a 5 month old puppy to the dog park... not doubting that she said it and you're telling the truth, just of her credentials. 

Puppies need positive, closely supervised socialization to ensure that they learn limits, don't get over-stimulated, and most of all, don't have a bad experience. An overcorrection from a snappy strange dog might not result in injury, but it can cause a lifelong issue. Some dogs get extremely fearful and nervous-aggressive around the type of dog they had a bad experience with as a puppy... a scary experience with a black dog will extend into all black dogs, for example. Not all adult dogs will escalate warnings appropriately with a puppy.

What you've described at the park - you throwing a ball for a long time, gathering up a cluster of dogs that are running and competing for a toy, a group of dogs too overstimulated to see a dog in their path, pulling your dog aside and scolding it in that environment - is setting your puppy up for failure, but it is a common enough mistake. Extremely excited energy can escalate when dogs are in a very active play group, and those situations tend to be where a fight breaks out, an individual is targeted, and/or someone gets hurt. With all that going on around him at the dog park, your puppy was not receptive to a correction, and he was too distracted to notice the frail dog in his path.

Your puppy does need experiences with other dogs to help him learn how to react in social situations and play nicely with others. That will include being mindful of his environment and respecting other dogs in the area. You could post on a local dog group asking for private playdates with dogs that are great with puppies, and start having playdates with the puppies from your class. You need your puppy to get growled and snarked at when he pushes limits, calmed down when he gets too excited, and taught to read body language. Even sitting outside of a dog park and watching the interactions can go a long way towards helping your pup learn about social cues."

When you’re over, offer to feed the dogs at dinnertime, and add canned pumpkin while pointing out how it’s great for weight loss - “it helps the dog feel full, see how much she likes it? Awesome trick, I wish it worked for me, haha!” Sometimes the sweet approach works, sometimes it doesn’t, but it’s good to exhaust that one before moving onto the ‘harsh reality’ approach. If MiL succeeds in helping this dog lose even two pounds, congratulate her and praise her hard work and acknowledge how difficult it must’ve been but how it’s paying off.
