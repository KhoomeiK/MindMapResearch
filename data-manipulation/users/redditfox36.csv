depression,ff6evam,t3_ertr7x,1579625677.0,Guess why I have spent like 10k hours playing video games
SuicideWatch,fek7hw8,t3_epe0nv,1579194217.0,When I was 5-7 years old I went to the hospital after drinking quite some meds we had... My parents found out and took me to the hospital where they just shoved a pipe trough my mouth and I was fine after...I was known to like the flavor of the syrups so no one even questioned much why a young kid would do that... Im 20 now and sometimes I feel like I should have tried harder...
selfharm,fef9zfk,t3_eoj4cw,1579051674.0,Yes I started doing it a few fays ago because I hate myself and I can't sleep at night because of my past and the fact that I have lost all my hope on a better future for myself... Its been too many years now... I had the chance do be happy but I have failed and wasted all of them... I feel like I deserve it... for many reasons I deserve to be a lone wolf who suffers everyday and night...

depression,f8g7t7k,t3_e0l7a2,1574555544.0,I too have a couple of friends that tried to hear me out but I just can't explain much and I feel specially because im not very good with words... I have tried to start a conversation and tell them something that happened recently or a while ago but that has really marked me but thats all I could do so far... I just tried to write a text today and I might have wrote like at least 1k words there and its all messed up...
