union,ffpelp8,t1_ffpdvtb,1580093115.0,"Listen man, YOU ARE OWED NOTHING. In the trades you have to make production and prove your worth every fucking day. Yeah there's some shitbags that still get work, but they're just warm bodies that are gone when quality work matters. If you keep blaming others to explain away your lack of progression, it will handicap you while other people see that you've given up. Perception matters."
union,ffpan1r,t1_ffp9xjy,1580090313.0,"Dude. I mean no offense when I say that you are not even an apprentice yet. I was there once. You have to put your time in; some bad, some good. That's the ditches v. hospitals. Pass tests, get certificates, and bust ass. Nobody cares about the last job you were on. It's the one you're on NOW that matters. To the person next to you, their boss, the one in the trailer, and the ones in the office. That's how it works and fighting it is a sisyphean task."
union,ffp9r51,t1_ffp8vit,1580089695.0,"There's an old parable that I heard that really helps me when the job or even my employment situation isn't ideal:

 A man is walking down a road in his neighborhood when he  comes upon two guys digging a ditch, about 20 feet apart. He asks the first guy he comes to, ""what are you working on?""
The guy in the ditch says, ""I'm digging a ditch, what does it look like?""
So the man walks on and comes to the other guy and asks, ""what are you working on?"" The second guy says, ""we're building a hospital.""
Build hospitals, don't dig ditches.


Change your perspective and your attitude, gratitude, and overall mental health will change.
Doing bullshit is part of the job; take satisfaction in doing the job well because atta boys and pats on the back are few and far between."
union,ffp8f5z,t1_ffp7ytw,1580088801.0,"I hate to break it to you, but you will have to work with/for assholes AND genuinely great people in equal measure throughout a career in the trades. No one, not even the superintendents,  get to say, ""I don't like that person so I'm not going to work with them. ""  Interpersonal skills are vital and tragically underrated skills to have in any trade."
union,ffp7lqr,t1_ffp7cdc,1580088237.0,"Field operations. It's the equivalent to a Human Resources position in other industries.  The field operations person is responsible for deciding who goes where, and for what task, in regards to their respective company's projects."
union,ffp765l,t1_ffp6osu,1580087934.0,"Hahaha, you're a blame machine. If they really thought you were good, they would've referred to their field ops person, not just sympathizing with a complainer to get them to shut up. Nobody owes you anything. Grow. The. Fuck. Up."
union,ffp53l2,t1_ffp4zk6,1580086416.0,So ask them for a job.
Showerthoughts,ffp3lzp,t1_ffp3dyw,1580085617.0,"That's how adults behave, admitting when they're wrong and owning it, as I did. Calling names and being petty is for children."
union,ffp11ut,t1_ffp049j,1580084133.0,"Enlighten me, what's your point, that you deserve special treatment because you were in the yard on a big job and your teachers blew smoke up your ass? Look in the mirror, tough guy, and own your shit."
union,ffp00oj,t1_ffozsjw,1580083819.0,Fuck if I know
union,ffozq0r,t1_ffoyl0k,1580083707.0,"Ok, you're right, you shouldn't have to prove that you have the aptitude to perform a job that directly impacts public health and safety. Is that the response you need?"
Showerthoughts,ffoykyr,t1_ffowfmp,1580083344.0,And I hope that I someday have the confidence to smugly reply to a reddit comment without following the entire comment thread where someone admitted that they were wrong.
union,ffoxn38,t1_ffox9yu,1580083092.0,"Dude, you're either willfully ignorant or just plain dumb. Your ""whole point"" is an excuse for your own failure of a test given to thousands of people. Grow up and take responsibility for yourself."
union,ffox44e,t1_ffox04u,1580082861.0,"Well, my reading comprehension is on par with my math skills, what can I say?"
union,ffowxv7,t1_ffowvk9,1580082780.0,You know this how?
union,ffowu3t,t1_ffownp4,1580082733.0,"More excuses, more blaming and deflecting. Just fucking study, man."
union,ffouqln,t1_ffou381,1580082009.0,"So what? Get your shit together and pass the test on your own merit rather than crying for letters and exceptions. Being a capable plumber is no joke, get it wrong and people can get sick, not to mention that buildings can be damaged by shoddy work. Take responsibility for yourself"
union,ffott7l,t1_ffotj9o,1580081728.0,"""Every journeyman."" More like every one that nodded along to the edited sob story you gave them. Who's really the idiot here, I passed my tests on the first go, did you?"
union,ffot9j3,t1_ffot0g9,1580081478.0,"Fucking duh, geometry is part of running pipe to where it needs to go while maintaining appropriate pitch. You keep making the case for why you deserved to fail."
union,ffossuu,t1_ffosn4v,1580081273.0,YOU CAN'T GET INTO THE TRADES IN VEGAS?!? You're dumber than I thought.
union,ffosi6p,t1_ffos9yx,1580081137.0,"Hahaha,  why would I want to visit whatever shithole you're living in?"
union,ffor020,t1_ffoqx4v,1580080645.0,"Could you even lift it, sonny?"
union,ffoqdcl,t1_ffoq59l,1580080466.0,"What, that you're a dumb ass kid?"
union,ffopent,t1_ffop2fv,1580080145.0,Finally something we can agree on.
union,ffoobuu,t1_ffon58q,1580079886.0,"I am definitely not your bro, junior. And no, you haven't done anything but bitch about unfairness regarding your inability to qualify for a job that is incredibly important to society at large. Maybe once you move out of your parents house you'll see things differently, but I doubt it.  And by the way, you just wasted most of a day arguing and posting online when you SHOULD have been studying instead of hoping for special treatment."
union,ffomd0j,t1_ffol8xh,1580079120.0,"You've answered nothing. You are defensive about your ""right"" to a special exception. Calling names and cursing when someone points out your incorrectness just shows that you are not an adult or are capable of accepting responsibility for your actions and words. I hope you never make it into the union, I'd be embarrassed to call you a brother."
union,ffoku92,t1_ffokdf8,1580078706.0,"Which conclusions have I jumped to? The one that says you're a whiner who blames others for their failure? Or the one that says if you can't do the math for a job that is critical to public health and safety, then you don't deserve the job?"
Showerthoughts,ffojrvh,t1_ffoi3v0,1580078399.0,Ok. I stand corrected.  Thanks for my fact of the day.
union,ffo6hcv,t1_ffmnx3c,1580074609.0,"""I failed but complained enough to get someone to write a letter so I deserve it!"" The mental gymnastics you're doing to justify the special treatment you feel entitled to while talking about equal opportunity deserve a gold medal."
Showerthoughts,ffo12nm,t1_ffmowgx,1580073038.0,I hope that I someday have the confidence to make up words and defend them when challenged.
union,ffmpk4x,t1_ffmolz7,1580057586.0,"Somebody with such thin skin and an inability to do basic math has no place in the trades. And I never said I was a laborer. Your entitlement is showing again as you put down other tradespeople BEFORE you're even part of a trade yourself. You think you're special because some teachers had kind words for you, get over yourself,  that's part of being a good teacher and a decent person."
union,ffmnshl,t1_ffmn5t9,1580057057.0,"There's that class again. You say that you ""ran a material yard,"" but ""wasn't sorting material."" Sounds like you couldn't pass a drug test much less a math test."
union,ffmmjcs,t1_ffmm9k7,1580056712.0,Good for you. Sounds like you should try being a laborer.  Sorting materials is a far cry from being a professional plumber. You reek of entitlement.
union,ffmlthf,t1_ffmlid3,1580056418.0,More excuses. I'm glad you didn't make the cut. You're the type of person that bitches about the union while taking full advantage of what it provides.
union,ffi5981,t1_ffi5405,1579965435.0,Maybe spend less time bitching on Reddit and more time studying for the test.
union,ffi50w6,t1_ffgxouw,1579965258.0,"""Ya you aren’t in a union.""

Neither are you"
AskReddit,ffgujn9,t1_ffgtyk3,1579915420.0,"Yeah... I looked them up while I was obtaining my degree...in economics. Gast your flabber all you want, cursing at people and insulting them is definitely the best way to prove that you're a super smart person with a valuable opinion.  Thanks for enlightening me. And I'll put it in a way you can understand, I'll talk as much as I fucking want, you keyboard commando fuckstick."
AskReddit,ffgtmte,t1_ffgtih9,1579914754.0,Ok. Thanks for making it clear that you have no idea what you're talking about.
