booksuggestions,ffgz2sl,t3_etdc2c,1579918761.0,"Don’t be embarrassed! I’m about to be 30 and I still love a good YA novel thrown in from time to time! And I legit reread Harry Potter at least twice a year so there’s no age limit on books! The Throne of Glass series by Sarah J Mass is a great step into fantasy and the Red Rising series by Pierce Brown would be a great dip into sci fi! You could also try Where the Crawdads Sing or Circe, they’re both fantastic!"

SkincareAddiction,felrqw8,t1_felignl,1579229318.0,"I love this! Last year I had an epiphany about the amount of waste I was producing, plus I realized I had fallen into the consumerist culture of more more more. Skincare was my main addiction. So in 2019, I barely bought anything through the year and vowed to use everything I had. My skin has actually improved now that I’ve simplified, I’ve saved a ton of money, and I feel great about it. And you’re so right about recycling. I always felt justified in using single use materials because I’d recycle, then I found out that most stuff still ends up in the dump and it’s better to just consume less/more sustainable choices when possible and stop giving my money to companies that don’t care about the environment."
