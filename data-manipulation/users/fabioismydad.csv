my drug of choice was methamphetamine and i was using for 19 months before i decided enough was enough. i was on the same boat as you, OP, & i kept putting off getting clean because i was scared I'd never be the same smart & friendly girl i once was. im now a month clean and i'm feeling more & more like myself every single day. 

it gets easier, but im not going to lie, it *feels* harder on a day-to-day basis. it's up to you to focus on getting help with your mental health & building a great support system. surround yourself with friends & loved ones & keep yourself busy. write a letter to yourself detailing all the reasons you hate using & read it every time you wanna use again. be excited about college!! you're going to meet so many great people who will make an impact on your life. 

you fucking got this, OP! i'm insanely proud of you for making the right choice to post this here — do not bottle anything up, open up to people when you think you need help, even if it's the people of Reddit. you got this!!! good luck!!"
