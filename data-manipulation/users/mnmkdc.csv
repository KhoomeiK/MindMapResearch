I'm not even for a league wide retirement but if we were to make a comparison it would be better to just look at the NBA. And the respect for Kobe is probably above that of Jordan as a person/athlete. So if more teams/league would like to honor him I think it would be fair"

Whether you like it or not, they're still a pretty popular rap duo that a lot of people really enjoy so clearly it's really not as objectively bad as you're making it sound. No one here is claiming that this is some kendrick level music, its just fun to listen to and it's funny.

politics,ffgaw78,t1_ffg8jkt,1579902214.0,"What? Obviously a lot of them are working in warehouses and some are developers or engineers. The point is that the value of the c-level people is significantly more valuable because their responsibility and requirements is much higher than your average employee.

Also the point is shes trying so hard to be flirty and he literally just ignores her jokes and makes no effort to flirt back. 

The hello there was a reference that she just didnt understand. I doubt most girls would recognize the reference and respond correctly. On the other hand I dont think theres really any question about her two jokes.


But yeah a lot of people are pretty socially unaware which is pretty clear. People are awful at reading signals and reading tone. Sometimes it's purely in jest which I get but in posts like this I cant help but cringe at how poorly this guy responds."

politics,fffnb17,t1_fffm2k0,1579887643.0,I'm not saying manual labor has no value but intellectual labor has much more potential value.

Plus if you're not socially awkward it's something you're going to do pretty naturally considering most other young people do it too. It would feel strange to be writing in a significantly more formal tone than the person you're texting
politics,fffg164,t1_ffffjr1,1579883163.0,Sure but that doesnt prove my statement wrong whatsoever. Manual labor is valued less because it's something with almost no requirements. It doesnt mean it's easy but it is less valuable without a doubt
Tinder,fffexpx,t1_fffe90v,1579882482.0,"Putting periods at the end of every sentence is, at least in america, really weird for younger people. It's common knowledge here that if you're texting informally, especially flirting, ending your last sentence with a period sounds like you're being really serious

politics,fffemcp,t1_fffc2uu,1579882280.0,I totally agree that billionaires shouldnt really exist but the value of someone's work isnt about the actual amount of work someone does. Manual labor isnt near as valuable as intellectual labor.

Tinder,fff5157,t1_ffexbtx,1579875873.0,Its because guys dont care much about girls heights but girls are more attracted to taller guys. A lot of online dating is based on looks for the initial interaction

hiphopheads,fff3on3,t3_et7p8e,1579874856.0,"Honestly I like it less than I did originally. Theres some distractingly bad bars in there (for example ""like a liars pants, I'm on fire"") that are as bad as anything logic has ever been criticized for. 

I enjoy Darkness on it's own but it does feel like the message is a little less meaningful when the first song on the album is him joking about bombings and terrorist attacks. 

Stepdad feels like old em but not good old em. It feels to me like a song like Kim where the song is very memorable because of how extreme it is but it isnt especially sonically pleasing. 

The ed Sheeran song and the skylar grey song both miss the mark entirely for me as well.

Overall the best songs on the album imo are Yah yah, darkness, unaccommodating, Godzilla. The production is solid front to back but Ems lyrics fall pretty short. I think I'd give the album 5-6/10"

I'm a hip hop head but I was pretty excited to hear production like that in a pop album. I'm not a huge fan of hers but it is an album that really caught my attention because of the production when I first heard it. I'm not going to say her music is revolutionary or anything but I think she has the most musical potential of the younger generation right now.

 I also think her music is somewhat unique just with the vocal style she used along with the production that I've mentioned earlier m"
AskReddit,ffd262l,t1_ffd1az4,1579811939.0,That's the thing. People don't hate it because its atheism. They hate is because its just a sub for edgy people.

AskReddit,ffd0xii,t1_ffczbcd,1579811246.0,No either way you proved its that kid that just wants to argue. Besides r/atheism is more about hating on religion than anything else. That's why its such a hated sub

AskReddit,ffcy887,t1_ffcwu1h,1579809733.0,"Honestly this is a bigger insult to your own taste. Its pop music and it's not similar to edm. I think the thing that stands out about her music other than her voice is the production really is top tier especially for pop music.  If shes able to evolve past her edgy phase and still keep her sound intact I think her music is only going to get better

Honestly though from your username and a couple of your comments alone, the edgy thing kinda seems like your kind of thing so I'm surprised you hate her music so much"

me_irl,ffcudg0,t1_ffc4810,1579807446.0,Imo it's a pretty bad tactic for actually trying to get people to join. Religious or not satan is a symbol of evil so you probably get more edgy atheists than decent people who want to make a change and also are atheists

AskReddit,ff9npwq,t3_esdjti,1579716824.0,"My taste is very different from most redditors. I'm not a fan of mad max, star wars (not bad but dont love it. World building also felt pretty underwhelming), avengers  (I think its decent but not great), and Tarantino. I'm just not a fan of actiony movies because they usually feel pretty corny to me.

Lord of the rings I think seems like a fantastic movie series but for some reason I'm not actually that interested in the story. The world and backstory fascinate me and every time Ive seen the movies I end up researching lore from the movies for hours. However I probably cant even name all the main characters from the movies themselves.

I don't understand the star wars hype. For one, the original trilogy feels really old. The effects were revolutionary and everything for sure but you cant watch it now and say that the signature transitions and the alien creatures dont just feel  outdated. Another issue for me is the world building. Every planet we see is extremely one dimensional. The characters also have superhero movie levels of plot armor."
