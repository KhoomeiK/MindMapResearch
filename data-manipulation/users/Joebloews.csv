Damnthatsinteresting,ffi8lbl,t1_ffa3nmx,1579967889.0,Believe that if you wish.  I'll go with the serial fire starters who did this for months.
FloridaGators,ffi8e8i,t1_ffi2u71,1579967748.0,"Sadly, it was lost on him. He is the biggest whiner know it all on this sub.  Completely obnoxious and unaware."
YouShouldKnow,ffh92p3,t1_ffg1bvz,1579926639.0,Were you also in the Navy?
CFB,ffh849t,t1_ffh7bqy,1579925815.0,So a loss from last season somehow counts against this season?
CFB,ffh8184,t1_ffh7gxl,1579925743.0,You are fucking dense
CFB,ffh7zhk,t1_ffh7h8s,1579925704.0,It's completely accurate.  Name the two teams the Gators lost to the past season and correct yourself.
CFB,ffh7smc,t1_ffh68ew,1579925542.0,Yes he was due to the fact Mullen has only been at Florida for 2 years.
CFB,ffh7q2p,t1_ffh4z8s,1579925484.0,Not at Florida.
CFB,ffh7p5n,t1_ffh6h4d,1579925462.0,Really? Are you talking the second best coach in their history who finished around .500 overall?
CFB,ffh7n6x,t1_ffh4u7p,1579925416.0,"MSU's second best head coach(behind Mullen) had a career .500 record overall!  That program is the Vandy/SCar of the west.

Edit: Mullen had that shithole of a school ranked number 1 with a 2 star TE playing QB."
CFB,ffh7gdn,t1_ffh70o4,1579925255.0,The Gators beat Auburn and they were No. 7 at the time. Same with Michigan the year before. Had they not lost to Florida they'd both be top ten finishers.  So what's your point? We won and finished in the top ten instead.
CFB,ffh7aou,t1_ffh6y47,1579925122.0,Seriously they're no better than Wake or Vandy over the long haul.  Maybe more like SCar.
CFB,ffh78dm,t1_ffh6uen,1579925067.0,"We only lost to two top ten teams, one of which won the title. Mind you, the Gators had no run game behind a green O-line."
FloridaGators,ffh70ix,t1_ffh53gg,1579924887.0,There is a huge difference when the other teams talent breaks the ankles of yours versus admiring their talent when there isn't direct contact amongst players.
FloridaGators,ffh6wdc,t3_etklrk,1579924794.0,I shall tell my 3 yo daughter in the morning. She loves Gator gymnastics. Maybe I can record the replay. . .
CFB,ffh6c2o,t1_ffh5smo,1579924330.0,"Deshaun has more passing and total yards than Tebow.  Tim has more rushing TD's. In two years of starting Deshaun put up back to back 5k total yd seasons (Tebow never hit 4k total in a season) Watson was the first to hit 4k yds passing and 1k yds rushing in a season.  Tebow only beats him in total rushing TD's in one more season of starting. Watson has more passing TD's  and again in one less season.

Edit: again where is Rodney Dangerfield when you need him? I linked Watson's stats in an earlier comment.

Double edit: Watson went 32-2 as a starter.

Triple edit: I'm a Gator fan with 3 different Tebow jerseys. I love Tebow."
FloridaGators,ffh0x29,t1_ffgt1sh,1579920150.0,How do you think you come off?
CFB,ffgbd4s,t1_ffg9ror,1579902500.0,"Case Keenum didn't exactly take his team from a good program to a great one. Clemson was coming off of one BCS bowl in which they were smoked, 5 losses in a row to their rival.  He single handedly put them on the map.  Back to back years with 5,000 total yards. Not only did he elevate his school into a contender while setting records he then showed up when it mattered most and smoked Bama's defense in the Natty twice."
CFB,ffgasiz,t1_ffg5u4m,1579902153.0,I'm a Florida fan bud. Watson put up monster numbers throughout his career as I've stated he put up better numbers than Tebow. Your two game sample size is way off the mark. Watson showed up to play and made it happen while setting records. He had 50 total TD's his senior year.  Where's Rodney Dangerfield when ya need him?
CFB,ffg5bo7,t1_ffg2b4x,1579898782.0,"Deshaun Watson had better numbers than Tebow in college through his career in one less year.

Edit: downvote all ya like but I'm right."
CFB,ffg4jyx,t1_ffg2v2u,1579898312.0,How does going for over 500 yards in two national title games against two of the best all time Bama teams not put him in that conversation? He was a one man show and elevated Clemson to an entirely new level.  He personally ended the Clemsoning moniker that was attached to them at the time.
CFB,ffg2fds,t1_fffshw7,1579896998.0,Unless Trevor Lawrence decides to stay for his senior season.
CFB,ffg24hw,t1_fffz4k8,1579896810.0,"https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/deshaun-watson-1.html

Read these numbers, realize Clemson was not what they are now. He put up the first 4k yard +1k rushing season in history. His freshman year he played against SCar with a torn ACL just to ensure victory (had surgery before bowl game). He twice went for over 500 total yds and 4+TD's against two of Bama's best defenses during their run.  What were you watching?"
CFB,ffg0nde,t1_fffzvew,1579895901.0,"That Auburn wasn't, lol.

Edit: Stephen Davis was still functionally illiterate when he left Auburn."

CFB,fffge60,t1_fffdfsi,1579883383.0,Someone doesn't understand branding and where those two teams mentioned are in relation to it.
CFB,ffff16g,t3_et425l,1579882543.0,Add Boise and NDSU to the PAC so both the teams and conference will finally get some due respect.
ChevyTrucks,ffdj806,t1_ffd8w65,1579822020.0,"Few and far between.  I changed the fluid before it became hard(mine was sluggish) which has since gone away.

ChevyTrucks,ffd43hq,t3_esz8tr,1579813033.0,Welcome to the club! I'm currently at 278k on my '03.  I bought one after having managed a car dealership.  I noticed time after time these things rolling in on trade with 200k+ miles still going strong. I've only had to replace an alternator outside of basic maintenance.

CFB,ffcrcbr,t1_ffcfwor,1579805661.0,What? Upstate is Tiger country all the way.  You must have meant Lexington County.
FloridaGators,ffautyx,t1_ffaswlo,1579745006.0,I'm sure that was their thinking. Let's get rid of this battle between 1 and 2 in the SEC so we can get this Ole Miss vs UT shitshow going.
