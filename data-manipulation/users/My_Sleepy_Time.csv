AskReddit,ff920a7,t3_es53p0,1579702875.0,"Not appreciating them by forgetting they have inherent worth, that they have many characteristics that overlap and differ with yours, that they don't exist and or to impress others,  that we're here to engage in communion with one another and nature. If one forgets those things, the person is not boring, but they are bored by the person for not acknowledging the many reasons to appreciate them. No one will mesh with everyone but that has nothing to do with boringness. It has to do with connectedness, maybe based on overlapping values or interest in someone's perspectives. I mean, some people pick people to hang out with based on common hobbies or how cool those people are, but many of those relationships aren't fulfilling because they're entertainment-oriented. That's not to say that relationships that began and developed based on common hobbies/popularity don't end up evolving, but maybe it'll be the kind but ""boring"" person in the work office who offers to be there with you during your darkest moments and appreciates your existence more than anyone else ever has."
offmychest,ff86tvi,t1_ff862b8,1579667641.0,Ohhh. So you just try not to dwell? I could use that mindset. I'd be a lot less pimply from stress.
offmychest,ff85m9n,t1_ff7t98x,1579666640.0,Jealous of what? I'm not even married. I'm 21 and in university and it was just on my mind because a lot of people confess to doing things like this on platforms like Reddit where there aren't really any consequences. Relationship dynamics both fascinate me and pain me. I think I'm allowed to be curious and upset about something without it (yet/ever) applying to me.

offmychest,feyxrh2,t1_feyqs9b,1579451741.0,I don't believe in falling out of love. I think there's something wrong with the person's idea of love in the first place. </3
offmychest,feywo3g,t3_equlvf,1579451464.0,"I understand. Thinking about it gives me really bad crying spells, honestly, and I've never been in a relationship, haha. Even when I'm in uni lectures, my mind can't compartmentalize so I find myself starting to dwell on these things and it feels like there's a heavy stone in my heart and my eyes get close to doing the thing where they want to water my desk as if something will grow. People are temporary, though. They come, and even if they stay in your life or go, they're going to die, sometimes before you. The only constants are that we share in communion with nature and the state of being human and that we've been touched by everything and everyone around us."

offmychest,fewjbws,t1_fetif33,1579411763.0,"The prevalence of the ""give up"" mentality is disheartening. I believe that love that is nurtured on both sides stands no chance against every reason to part ways. <3"
offmychest,fepgvb5,t1_fep2drm,1579320166.0,I'm glad I did too!!! I was definitely projecting my fear onto you until I saw what you were getting at. I'm going to listen to your advice because I want to be a wonderful future SO and cherish my future partner and I want to be a person he considers cherish-able. Ty : )
offmychest,fep1wn9,t1_feomczs,1579310295.0,"I'm so sorry. A few minutes ago I read some of your comments above and got a bit defensive because I was a bit heartbroken (not the first girl you were talking to...my comments came much later but I deleted them after reading your responses here). Reading this one with its elaboration you seem caring and genuinely want the best for us women. Thank you. Just wasn't sure if you were saying women deserve to get cheated on and there's no such thing as trashy men, but your points do make sense now. It hurts when our fellow women get treated badly but being honest with one another and giving tips is great. : )"

offmychest,fennl6b,t3_epyqf2,1579288270.0,"1. Being in a relationship out of fear rather than love is way worse than never being in a relationship despite wanting one.
2. True love isn't something you have to meet X amount of ""unrelated to your soul traits,"" although your emphasis on a noble career and volunteering definitely reveal something about your character.
3. I know appearance matters to a lot of people but for me, that tends to be related to their ego being boosted rather than out of genuine concern for their partner's life expectancy.
4. You're not alone because we all share in something called ""humanity,"" but we're even connected to other organisms!!! How beautiful it is to be part of that  :)"

offmychest,fel5hwr,t3_epndfj,1579214490.0,"I know I'm not you, but I understand in a way. This aspect of the human experience is uncomfortable but I think within all uncomfortable aspects of life, we can find joy which is different from the absence of all things negative unlike happiness. I believe that we can find joy by pouring into relationships with people who get it or are trying to get it, and find joy by realizing we all-no matter how we look, how talented we are, on how much we go through-we have inherent worth and live in a world that is full of glimpses of our connection to something higher.

I believe that as much as many of us say we want to create a society that does not judge the worth of others based on attractiveness and achievements, we kind of don't want that because it takes away the ego boost we get from comparing ourselves to others ""lower"" than us. I think that's why we see people saying they want a certain kind of world but then going about life in the same manner they usually do. We're trapped in the system and it's scary to try to get out, kind of like that Black Mirror episode ""Nosedive"" where you get ostracized if others rate you too low but feel oh-so-good if others rate you very high.

I think there's something really beautiful about people seeing how much of a mess we are but choosing to surround themselves with us out of love for us. To me, a world full of perfect people would be a way less painful world to live in, but we wouldn't get the experience of people loving us in our not-so-perfect moments, so I think there's a trade-off. :)"

offmychest,fed8nq6,t3_eoczhp,1579003812.0,"Sometimes I have this feeling too. I've never heard any stories about sexual abuse within my family . I think for me it's because of the sexualization of young females and hearing about other people's dads leering after girls the same age as their daughters, and because of all the stories where trusted family members who are supposed to protect younger ones engage in sexual abuse"
offmychest,fed82si,t3_eod0fl,1579003163.0,"I'm not going to tell you one day you'll find your tribe or whatever. I will tell you that honestly, part of us might always feel lonely. It can hurt when someone does not respond lovingly to your vulnerable moments, BUT you have the power to remove yourself from any kind of relationship with people who invalidate you and don't show signs of wanting to understand and be supportive. Sometimes invalidation can be accidental but if you bring it up, people will admit they want to be there for you but don't know how and that it makes them uncomfortable to not know what to do. 

""Good"" at kissing? I would imagine that's something that improves over time as you and your partner learn one another's pace. I think that's about paying attention each time. Not that I would really know. I've also only kissed someone once, and a wee more further, and then he tossed me to the side, lol. Granted I was annoying. I'm at peace with it now, though. Someone who is good for you will reassure you and create an environment for both of you to be honest, not only about the touch-touch aspects but also the relationship in general. \^\^

Therapy is meant to help you grow and work on some of these things. As someone who is considering becoming a therapist in the future, I would want my clients to be as open with me as they are able to be at the time. I'd have gotten higher education to be able to help people in the manner of my choosing, so it would suck if my clients didn't feel like I've created a safe environment for them to connect with themselves and give me an idea of what they need from me. :("

rant,fcp9ntr,t3_ei853l,1577855299.0," I understand that people who don't drive like they took classes on it can annoy many of us, but they probably have other good qualities. It sucks that people are affected by bad driving- sometimes very severely- but that will always be the case even with dash cams. Not that better driving shouldn't be encouraged... : ( Happy New Year and I'm hoping your experiences on the road from hereon-out will be more positive!!!"
