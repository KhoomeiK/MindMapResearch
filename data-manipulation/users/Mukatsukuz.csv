One experience I had, which I am copying and pasting from an old blog I ran that I no longer have access to (was on my previous company's email and I can't remember the email address). 

 ""Was driving along - 22:45 approximately - on the busiest road, arriving at the busiest roundabout there is in this area.  
Suddenly, my clutch goes loose and the car stalls, going up a hill, in the middle of 4 lanes. Somehow I manage to get it almost to the side, so I am only blocking one lane, so I am able to call home. Of course, everyone who could help me has been drinking so cannot drive to tow me home.  


What happens next? Blue lights in rear view mirror. BOLLOCKS!!! Not only is my car broken down and I cannot find anyone to help me, but now here are the police to arrest me for stopping my car in the worst place imaginable.  
But no, the policeman feels sorry for me and drives my car, sans clutch (which is ok as long as the roads are totally clear and you're a policeman, making it legal), to a safe place for me to call a tow truck. On the way, he asks where I live and I tell him it's next to the hospital (still wondering how the hell I will get home from this safe place).  
He says how he is training the other policeman, driving behind us, to do police escorts for ambulances and offers to do a full training exercise using my car.  
This means he drives my car, minus the clutch, with full police escort - lights and sirens all the way- stopping every car we come close to, so he doesn't have to change gear.  


How on Earth did I break down when a policeman training someone to do escorts to hospitals was behind me, when they are the ONLY policecar in the area (according to him) and I live next to a hospital? Calculate the odds and get back to me! :-)""

I found seeing my legs suddenly flying up in front of me very disorientating. As this rarely happens, though, I am sure if I took a break and went back to it after these parts, then I would have a lot less motion sickness.

One experience I had, which I am copying and pasting from an old blog I ran that I no longer have access to (was on my previous company's email and I can't remember the email address). 

 ""Was driving along - 22:45 approximately - on the busiest road, arriving at the busiest roundabout there is in this area.  
Suddenly, my clutch goes loose and the car stalls, going up a hill, in the middle of 4 lanes. Somehow I manage to get it almost to the side, so I am only blocking one lane, so I am able to call home. Of course, everyone who could help me has been drinking so cannot drive to tow me home.  


What happens next? Blue lights in rear view mirror. BOLLOCKS!!! Not only is my car broken down and I cannot find anyone to help me, but now here are the police to arrest me for stopping my car in the worst place imaginable.  
But no, the policeman feels sorry for me and drives my car, sans clutch (which is ok as long as the roads are totally clear and you're a policeman, making it legal), to a safe place for me to call a tow truck. On the way, he asks where I live and I tell him it's next to the hospital (still wondering how the hell I will get home from this safe place).  
He says how he is training the other policeman, driving behind us, to do police escorts for ambulances and offers to do a full training exercise using my car.  
This means he drives my car, minus the clutch, with full police escort - lights and sirens all the way- stopping every car we come close to, so he doesn't have to change gear.  


How on Earth did I break down when a policeman training someone to do escorts to hospitals was behind me, when they are the ONLY policecar in the area (according to him) and I live next to a hospital? Calculate the odds and get back to me! :-)""
