For time travel, if you think of time as all potential states of three dimensions, then time travelling is just going to a state you were in before, but the moment you arrive it's part of a long list of states you've never been in. It doesn't modify the states in which you didn't time travel; those continue on in their own way.

As for genie compliance, he could make your wish come true by traveling back in time and either killing you before birth (so no true paradoxical effect there) or causing you to be brought to life without your mother actually giving birth to you (malicious compliance to your wish)."

todayilearned,fdcc7nx,t3_ekgyl8,1578271405.0,"Found some potentially conflicting numbers.

[This article from 2017](https://www.darrinqualman.com/global-production-transistors/) mentions a figure of `20 trillion per second`, or about `6.3e20 transistors per year`. Considering the article is from 2017, the numbers are likely outdated, although the OP article is from 2018, also likely outdated.

How does that relate to rice and wheat production?

[This article from 2017](https://www.world-grain.com/articles/8069-2017-18-world-wheat-crop-forecast-raised) gives a figure of the production of wheat in 2016/2017. It mentions `736 million tons`, or `7.4e14 grams` .

[This article from 2017](https://www.statista.com/topics/1443/rice/) mentions `496 million tons` of milled rice produced, or `5.0e14 grams`.

The weight of wheat is around `40g per 1000 seeds` ([source](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/grains-research-development/wheat-seed-weight-differs-between-varieties)). Inverse means that every seed weighs about `0.04 grams`. `7.4e14 / 4e-2` comes out to `1.9e16` seeds of wheat.

The weight of rice is around `1/64 of a gram` ([source](https://www.reference.com/world-view/much-single-grain-rice-weigh-c39a20469d3fe660)), or `0.016 gram`. `5.0e14 / 1.6e-2` comes out to `3.1e16` grains of rice.

Together that makes `5e16` grains of rice and wheat, which is actually `12.500` times less than the amount of transistors per year. Or in other words, Humanity produces `12.500` times more transistors annually than grains of wheat and rice combined. Of course, these are figures from 2017. Nowadays, transistor production should be up quite a bit more in comparison.

(If I made a mistake in my calculations along the way, do let me know.)"
