todayilearned,ffbq3hk,t1_ffalkv9,1579778071.0,I would say that an additional leg up for the sharks is that they don't have to go to the surface for air in the case of a pursuit situation.
politics,ff9pu0d,t1_ff9hqr8,1579718269.0,"He can just barely read as quickly as he speaks with a 2-3 second gap to where his comprehension of what he's reading catches up. You can tell when he flubs something in his speeches, doesn't have the comprehension from the context until several moments later, and then goes off on a wild tangent about the thing he accidentally said rather than the thing he was meant to say. It's hyperbolic to say ""can't fucking read"" but he's about as bad at reading his speeches as a fifth grader would be."
politics,fcuq6py,t1_fcuo5yf,1577986277.0,Almost every state apportions their pledged delegates proportionately so he should still only have \~45% of the pledged delegates. But then there's the unpledged/super delegates.
politics,fcupq7l,t1_fcunl9l,1577986028.0,Shouldn't we be hoping he's not still eligible to run in 2028?
todayilearned,fcuoe7w,t1_fcuanga,1577985274.0,"Hey, he only actually died a couple of times but he almost died like every other day."
todayilearned,fcu5eo2,t1_fcu38o8,1577972984.0,Except for the fact that he was in the field all the time almost dying. Maybe he wanted to able to actually help fight? IIRC he learned how to shoot at some point as well because I don't remember him carrying weapons early on but he definitely did at the end.
politics,fcn0t0n,t1_fclymt4,1577799948.0,"That word doesn't mean what you think it means or you're not using it correctly. Gaslighting:  manipulate (someone) by psychological means into questioning their own sanity. 

I have done nothing to make you question your sanity. I've only said that if the DNC commissioned a poll and that poll didn't go Yang's way, people on this sub would say they manipulated the poll or the pollster to exclude Yang. People are already saying they picked the window they picked to exclude Yang when A) it's blatantly obvious they picked the window they picked to *include* Klobuchar early and B) they have no control over when or how many polls are conducted (unless you think they should suddenly start including polls as official that they've never included before)."
politics,fcn0isa,t1_fclxlad,1577799686.0,"> The truth is probably in the middle.

It's absolutely in the middle. That's why they picked a date six (?) days before the last debate. That date was designed to include Klobuchar in the next debate. It was not done specifically to exclude Yang though. I can guarantee they were not even thinking about Yang when they picked the window. Unfortunately (since they have absolutely nothing to do with when polls get done) they didn't foresee that so few polls would come out for a huge stretch of the window. Again, this doesn't target Yang. It's just as good or bad for any candidate (that is not Klobuchar)."
politics,fcln1wb,t1_fclmq8k,1577751643.0,"It's pretty clear that what I wrote above didn't penetrate, so please read it again. Slowly. And if that doesn't help, try reading it again a few more times."
politics,fclmrrg,t1_fcllqwd,1577751452.0,"And if people read the news, they'd know that the DNC is expecting 4 qualifying early state polls to come out before the deadline. Plus there have been more than a few non-qualifying early state polls (IIRC) that show Yang still lagging below where he needs to be as well as qualifying national polls that still show him lagging well below where he needs to be to qualify."
politics,fclm6nf,t1_fclg18f,1577751049.0,"Fox News polls (A rated on 538) are an entirely different beast from the talking heads that appear on the entertainment channel. And yes, if a particular candidate pays for a poll and then that poll shows their support has shot up, that looks bad. Similarly, if the DNC commissions a poll and it shows a particular candidate's support *hasn't* gone up, that also looks bad and will further drive supporters (and people on this sub) insane."
politics,fcllaff,t1_fcli3wz,1577750438.0,"And if the DNC commissioned or paid for a poll and Yang still registered 3%, half the people in this sub would say it was rigged. If Yang himself wants to commission and pay for it because he thinks the numbers will change, then that's what he should do."

politics,fbjz0g5,t1_fbhob4c,1576942277.0,"Clinton (and how much time she spent in states she lost by narrow margins) has exactly the same thing to do with it as Stein running in those states. 

If running is campaigning, then Stein ran (and campaigned) in states that accounted for 97% of the electoral college. And I'm not sure what your statement adds to your argument because it really just furthers my point."
