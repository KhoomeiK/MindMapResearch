AskDocs,ffblo63,t1_ffb9sir,1579771444.0,"Op, I'm very sorry to hear of your father's cancer. I hope that some treatment can be found. You've been given some great advice here, especially by folks who have had loved ones with similar experiences and I believe you will take them to heart.

I can only imagine how frustrating and heartbreaking and maddening it must be to know he acquired Hep B from a transfusion, which might then have contributed to the cancer. I obviously don't know the circumstances surrounding the surgery, but as physicians here have pointed out, the doctor didn't screen the blood and didn't know it was tainted. And even if he had, *this is not the time to fight that battle*. You're going to have to set that aside for now, to focus on helping your father with the battle that lays ahead.

 Speaking as someone who can get a little carried away with recriminations myself, I would encourage you to step back and consider the way you are thinking and talking about the past. I understand your anger and your desire to let the world know this injustice has befallen your father. But focusing on how you've arrived where you are won't fix anything or change where you are. On the contrary, were you to speak like this in front of doctors, they are only human. If you are shaming and speaking ill of the doctor who performed the surgery in front of doctors trying to treat him now, they are, by human nature, likely to feel defensive and on guard when dealing with you believing it will only be a matter of time before you are speaking of them in the same manner. And that is not what you want, you want a team who is comfortable speaking with you and your father in a frank manner without worrying if it is going to blow up in their face in the future. In short, there is absolutely nothing to benefit your father by focusing on the past at this point.

And there is definitely nothing to be gained by bringing up this past misfortune around your father or other family. Bitterness and recrimination are very harmful for a person's attitude and outlook, so focusing on how he may have gotten the cancer cannot help your father. It also will not serve you well while you are under the stress you will be facing. Try (and I know it is a big ask) to set aside the how/why for now, and just focus on what you can do today and going forward to help your father be as happy and at ease as possible, because there is nothing that you can do that will be better for him than that. The treatment will be up to the doctors. His spirit will be up to you.

I hope this didn't come off as scolding, it wasn't meant that way. As I said, I too can get carried away with ruminations and recriminations, living in the past of ""what if's"" when there are people who need me fully present in the here and now instead. And it is in that spirit I've offered this advice.

My best wishes for your father, and for you."

todayilearned,ff7dga5,t1_ff6yodx,1579647003.0,"You do understand that all other crime does not cease because there’s a death penalty case pending, right? If you have to have those prosecutors, public defenders, and courtrooms tied up for all of the *extra time* a death penalty case requires - yet other crimes are still being committed and still need prosecuting... what has to happen?

Duh... they have to have **more prosecutors, public defenders, and courtrooms** to keep up with the other prosecutions. And guess what? All of those folks don’t work for free, all of that infrastructure isn’t just provided out of thin air, just because the other resources are tied up on a death penalty case that will take years and years to work through the appeals process. And then, the convicted is still likely to sit on death row for a decade or two anyway, which costs as much or more than putting them away for life to begin with. And this is all disregarding the extra expense required to provide the infrastructure of administering the actual execution. 

It’s also disregarding the incalculable cost to society of possibly executing an innocent person."
