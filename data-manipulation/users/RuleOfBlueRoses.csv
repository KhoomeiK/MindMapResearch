AskReddit,ffe0mew,t3_esse9d,1579833623.0,"I (26 F) went to eat at a restaurant with my grandmother, brother, and my parents, I think I was about 10 years old. I went to kill some time at the arcade section and after a while I was down to my last dollar. I put it in the machine for a racing game but it ate my money. So I went back to my table, and a couple minutes pass and I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn around and this boy who was probably a couple years older than me hands me my dollar and says, ""You forgot this!"" and I guess the machine must've spat it back out and I didn't notice! I'll always remember that. And my grandmother was so touched, she was like, ""Aww, how lovely. Things like this give me hope."""
