You chose that grumpy French single mom"
philosophy,few6psx,t1_feu8n9m,1579406080.0,"Non existence would a better experience than eternal pain for me, you summed it perfectly with sleeping. I think you only say so because you haven't experienced hell, I mean neither have I but when I think about it there's a certain level of pain that makes people suicidal, the ultimate acceptance of death. To not be able to suicide and suffer eternal existence in pain, would be a fate worse than death itself. 

Come to think of it while writing this, under torture, lots of people wish for death, a merciful fast kill rather than a slow painful death."

Only you can care about yourself. 
Options 1) Care, and do something about your life and get out of this misery. (how I go about it is I remind myself of my ancestors who lived in primal era, fought predators and lived in harsh condition, I'm blackpilled you could say, woke to life as its presented in its harsh nature, my mission on this earth, is to survive, pass my genes, and while I'm at it, do meaningful things, perhaps not as impactful as I may think. I'm not looking for happiness, I like it in moderation, happiness junkies never find peace, always looking for the next blooming experience, but life isn't as blooming and wholesome as one may think, it has it downs more than ups. Blue pill Society and Marketing and the way things are create an illusory world where one should chase happiness. 
2) Not care, been there done that. Basically you only exist because why not? Nothing... You are a void, void of meaning, void of self, and eventually void of emotions, contemplating suicide at every now and then, nothing really matters. After all, the world, heck the universe is doomed to an end. Everything everyone fought for, all these genes passing is for nothing if its gonna end one day, everything gone,  and if you're not the religious type, this is all a meaningless experience. Only it isn't. You exist. Now. And although you experienced non existence before (you came to life) and perhaps you think about it when considering suicide, how you were free, unaware of this world and its cruelty and how random and unfair it can be but YOU DO EXIST NOW, and that's all that MATTERS. Be selfish with your life, its yours and yours only, for you to fulfill, and it revolves around you, and no one else. Make something meaningful with your existence, before we all go extinct because it doesn't matter once we go extinct, heck there won't be even memories of any of this, emotions exist within us for a reason, designed to help us primarily, go with the flow, feel being alive because its very easy not to."

rant,fd23ju4,t3_ejagqs,1578141131.0,"Whoever invented rape? Lmao
Im pretty sure back in primal era, one of your greatest great grand father had to rape your greatest great grandmothet for your genes to pass along. Thats how your ancestors passed from generation to generation before civilization came to be."
Advice,fcvdmh6,t3_eizdmb,1577999896.0,"If you cant see her you are just deluding yourself and chances are shes already hooked with someone she can see, women dont love the same as men. She will certainly not pick you when a collection of men/boys are available locally.
Tl;dr Dont get depressed over girls, theyre not worth the time nor the effort, build your life around yourself not around a ""girl"" 
The more value you put in yourself the more likely she will notice you or any other girl for that fact, oh and forget hollywood and those romance movies it doesnt work like that irl."
