We were urged to protest at the airports when he issued the Muslim ban, and we did--the airports were PACKED with thousands of people and the media covered it.  We were then urged to protest in the streets if Trump fired Mueller or fired Jeff Sessions so that he could end the Mueller investigation, but when Sessions was fired, nobody knew where to go or what to do.  We were urged to march in the streets before the House impeachment vote.  We were urged to protest in the streets when he withdrew troops from Syria.  We were urged to protest in the streets when he killed Solomeini and almost started a war with Iran.  Now we're being urged to get out and protest in the streets for the Senate trial.    Honestly, we want to do something and feel active and energized, but we can't be expected to replicate the Women's March every time something happens.   Lots of times these things happen on weekdays and we have jobs, or they happen with little notice and we can't get a babysitter or some of us just don't see the point anymore.   

From this, the lesson I gather is that effective protest must have either a strong organizing body with planning and coordination or it asks something very simple of people to do--like get up and go to the airport right now to join the protest!

You declare that they are simply doing what everyone else is doing, they just got caught.  You argue some kind of scientific analysis of inflating footballs that you don't understand but it allows you to continue cheering for the Patriots.   And when the refs make a bad call in favor of the opponent, it's an outrage, but you don't mind at all when the refs make a call in favor of your team because it helps you win.

At some point it is, literally, impossible to live a more luxurious, better life by adding more wealth.  At that point, the accumulation of power is the only benefit to getting richer or even to have billions of dollars in wealth.  No other benefit than controlling the system and having your way in every way, winning every dispute and making other people do what you want.

Some would argue that another benefit of having billions of dollars is to do philanthropy and charity work that really makes a difference.

politics,fdi3p13,t3_elgjoh,1578435178.0,"Republicans are betting that literally nothing they do will hurt them with their base voters.  The question of whether they can win elections with just their base voters is up for debate but it depends on whether Democrats can put up inspiring candidates with good campaigns to run against them.  It really could go either way, which means this is a gamble McConnell is taking.  Pushing through with a blatant cover-up might cost GOP the Senate, apparently is a more attractive risk than holding a fair trial and then forcing R senators to acquit in the face of overwhelming evidence of wrong-doing.

So, my question is ... what if Bolton's testimony comes out one way or another without Senate subpoena.  It will still be blockbuster evidence against Trump and Republicans will still be stuck explaining why they acquitted Trump in spite of it, plus now they have to explain why they refused to hear Bolton's testimony and they have to explain it in a way that doesn't sound like ""Because that would be bad for Trump""

I'm no political expert, but this looks like a pretty sticky situation for Senate Republicans.  I'm not sure I'm buying McConnell's bravado--he may not be as confident as he pretends.  It may be he doesn't see *any* good options and this one is just the least bad option available."

When people are falsely claiming that people’s “right to vote” is being taken away by these voter purges, that is hysteria because it is simply not true.  Every purged voter still has the right to vote, even if it means they need to register again.  

When I turned 18 I gained the right to vote. What if nobody told me that?  What if somehow I remained ignorant of that fact?  Would I lose the right to vote?  What if I didn’t know how to register or what if I didn’t have time to register to vote?   Would I still have the right to vote?  Whose fault would it be if I did not vote?  It would be my own responsibility to find out how to register and then make time to do it. Right?

Even with automatic voter registration, it is necessary to purge voters from the rolls because people die or move away.  We need accurate voter rolls in order to plan election strategy and adequate polling resources.   How is it a good thing if the voter roll says there are 800,000 registered voters in a precinct where only 500,000 people live?  We have to purge inactive voters in order to have accurate voter rolls.  There are ways to ensure that purging happens fairly and accurately and that mistakes are easily corrected so that no voter would be unable to cast a ballot due to being purged by mistake.
