technology,ffex2ye,t1_ffevp7n,1579869022.0,"Bill Gates is actually one of the few people billionaires that is actually doing philanthropic good with his money.

You're right that he has a hoard of wealth, but only because he was so ridiculously successful that he can't _responsibly_ give it all away fast enough to make people who dislike billionaires happy.

He helped start the giving pledge, convincing billionaires to promise they'll donate vast swaths of their wealth instead of giving it all to their kids.

Yes, Bill Gates was ruthless during his career, but he has really turned himself around now that he's retired and has been working to convince other billionaires to be more like him. That's a great thing in my opinion. Hopefully more billionaires become like he is now.

If you want to criticize bad billionaires, Jeff Bezos is the worst. He is like what Bill Gates used to be, but worse. Token philanthropy at best (if he even gives anything), a serial tax evader, and ruthless businessman using any tricks he can to undercut the competition and milk business partners for whatever he can get."

As for why they care more about pro-life over children getting bombed in other countries? Probably a numbers and close to home thing.
