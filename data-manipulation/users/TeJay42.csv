Its a saying in the body building community. Something I assumed you would know that considering you're parading yourself as Mr.Brofessor. 

>BMI is unscientific and conor looks like a typical gym goer who has a few years in a gym.

It is quite literally scientific especially in conjunction with body fat percentage. Once again my example. 

Lets say my friend is 5'8 and 185 at 15% bodyfat and I'm 6'1 and 215 at 15% bodyfat. Who is buffer? Well BMI can give you a base number to tell how much mass you have. 

>He doesn't look like anything special, hes got a decent body fat percentage, big whoop.

Ah. So did the gym also make your wingspan 5 inches more than your height as well on top of making your shoulders comically capped in your second year as well?"

No he's not. This is a big misconception with combat sports. Conor doesn't weigh 155 lbs (70kg). 

Conor is 170 (77ish kg). That's what he walks around at. Ufc fighters much like wrestlers weight cut heavily to make weight. Conor cuts weight to make weight on the day of weigh in, and rehydrates before the night of the fight. 

Conor in this pic is actually competing at 145 (60ish kg i believe) and is *extremely* drained. This isn't the weigh ins of that fight, but it is a weigh in where he competes at 145. 

https://youtu.be/bZcXPzAZkx4

As I said, conors physique *looks* like he is on peds to achieve this muscle development but I don't think it is. USADA testing is so good they're popping guys for picograms of substance (which is a millionth of a grain of sand in terms of size) 

99% of the populace can not look remotely close to conor mcgregor without peds. He just has that good of genetics."
sports,fff42mr,t1_fff2w6b,1579875157.0,"Capped for all intents and purposes is another way to say round. Its a word commonly used in bodybuilding. 

It generally means that its wide in such a way that its significantly increasing the width of your shoulder because of how far outward they are. Capped shoulders are shoulders that appear round when looking at someone from the front and its hard to explain in just text. 

Google Yoel Romero. He has capped shoulder along with most big time body builders. 

Nate diaz is an example of a guy with not capped shoulders. 

Most UFC fighters (of whom many are wrestlers and are pretty jacked), NFL players, and wrestlers have capped shoulders at the high levels because of steroids and crazy athleticism."

Conor looks like a pro athlete.  Lets not downplay that statement now. 

Also no real retort to the shoulders statement? Gotcha. 

>Also, you might wanna read up on BMI.

BMI is a basic metric to show who is pound for pound taking up more mass. I'll give you an example. 

My friend is 5'8 and 185 lean. I'm 6'1 215 lean. How do we know who's buffer? You go to BMI and it'll give you a good enough idea. 

Conor at lean fighting weight has a BMI of 25. Odds are your BMI likely isnt that at a lower BF%"
sports,fff11xb,t1_ffezvmb,1579872740.0,">This looks like everybody who‘s went to the gym for a year or two on a regular basis.

Thats just simply not true. No one gets capped shoulders after 1 or 2 years in the gym and if they do its purely because of their genetic lay out and not because they developed their shoulders into that unless they're on gear. 

>, his chest is totally proportional to his shoulders.

His shoulders, and I stress this, are capped. Capped shoulders are generally a tell tale sign of steroids because that kind development in your shoulders is to put it lightly, rare. I'd be inclined to think Conor is on gear if USADA wasn't flagging guys for using cheap creatine let alone any actual steroid or sarm. 

Conors lats, shoulders and long ass arms are to put it simply, fucking crazy. 

Like I said, Conor isn't in and of himself a big guy. He's only 5'9. But pound for pound at lean body weight he probably has a higher BMI than you"

Conors *pecs* sticks out a weird amount and is developed very weirdly. They are also oddly high up.

Most of the time you see his pecs in the gif his arms are extended which makes your pecs look flatter and not as big. 

If you don't believe me stand in front if your mirror and stick your arms out as if you're t posing and you'll notice your pecs look smaller.

Your study is super flawed and doesn't take into account accidents at all. Men do get into more accidents and get more tickets but they also drive 16.55k miles per year where women drive 10k per hear.
