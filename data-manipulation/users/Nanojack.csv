What's your price range? There's a Hyatt I think is pretty nice right around the corner from the Blue Cross Arena. Your other option downtown is the Holiday Inn by the convention center, which I think is ok, but not as recently redone as the Hyatt. Going a little afield, there's the Strathallan and the Inn on Broadway, both are closer to luxury hotels. If you're looking for more reasonable hotels, coming down Mount Hope Ave or East Henrietta Road, there are a couple of options, the Hilton Garden Inn, Holiday Inn Express and Country Inn and Suites.

Money no object and don't mind being 20 minutes away? Get a suite at the Lodge at Woodcliff."

politics,fek0veg,t1_fejl3kp,1579190211.0,"That's kind of exactly what I said. The impeachment clause specifies that any ""civil Officer of the United States"" can be impeached and removed from office. While Article II, where the impeachment clause is found, deals with the legislative branch, impeachment has been extended to the judicial branch, and in 1798 to the legislative branch when the House began impeachment hearings against Senator William Blount. It never progressed beyond that because the Senate used the Article I powers to expel him de facto, if not de jure. It remains unsettled legally whether the Constitution allows for legislators to be impeached, but it will never be tested because each house has the power to discipline or expel their own members. It kind of also remains unsettled legally whether Presidents can be prosecuted by federal and state law enforcement and be arrested. The only thing stopping it at this point is the DOJ memo, and in fact President Grant was arrested by a DC cop for speeding in his horse and buggy, and Grant neither contested the arrest or the fine."
