fpv,ffqhpsv,t1_ffqfjw7,1580134913.0,"Yes! Im sorry i never got back to you. Ive only been able to fly twice since i got the antenna but its a noticeable difference. I can fly all the way around my house and an easy several hundred feet farther with a pretty clear video. 

The fact that my none of my antennas matched polarization killed my signal. I ended up getting the Foxeer Lollipop V3 omni directional RHCP and a Crazepony RHCP Patch. Both are on amazon."
reddeadredemption,ffoxe2r,t1_ffnncdl,1580082988.0,"I was thinking the same thing like minutes before you posted this. 



Get out of my house."
reddeadredemption,ffnj9yd,t1_ffmpglb,1580066668.0,Not even full ultra lol its a mix between high and ultra. My case has terrible airflow and would probably catch fire at full ultra.

BikiniBottomTwitter,ffals9s,t1_ffajj5x,1579738935.0,I always start Saudi because fuck them.
millionairemakers,fersdih,t3_eq81a8,1579357820.0,Fuck yeah. Spread it.
fpv,femu5gh,t1_femiqes,1579269671.0,I ended up buying the Foxeer Lollipop v3 super mini rhcp antenna and the Crazepony 5.8ghz 13DBi SMA Male Patch Antenna. I wont have them until sunday but I'll do my best to post a video if the range is any better.
fpv,fekhb9v,t1_fekc5ry,1579200039.0,"I thought about waiting to get some money for some HDO2's but I'd much rather figure this problem out first and make sure it isnt something faulty with the quad or goggles first. And its a cheap option, much cheaper than $300+ for some fatshark goggles"
fpv,fekg9ht,t1_fekciqf,1579199413.0,Thats what i figured. Its a cheap option and worst case scenario i just end up with some better antennas for my next quad
fpv,fekbj2r,t1_fekb40f,1579196598.0,"It could very well be the antennas. The clover leaf is a RHCP antenna, the panel doesnt specify and the omni directional is omni directional. Im going to buy 2 RHCP antennas and a RHCP patch and see how that does. Having antennas that are opposite polarizations can lead to -13dB in range, a 3dB change by itself can lead to issues."
fpv,fekbao4,t1_fekazcf,1579196461.0,Thats what i figured. Thank you. I saw having different polarized antennas can give you  -13dB on range.
fpv,fekaf5e,t1_feka98v,1579195947.0,"Will have to when i get home from work, wont be til around 5pm eastern time."
fpv,fekadjb,t1_fek8lgh,1579195921.0,"Could it be the antennas dont match? The clover leaf antenna it came with is RHCP but the aomway on my quad is just omni directional and doesnt list LHCP or RHCP. If i got all RHCP, would that help?"
fpv,fek9d2k,t1_fek8lgh,1579195322.0,A lot of reviews say they get 500meters or so on stock antennas. Theres even a 1km test flight video but i cant get anywhere close to that. My backyard has a lot of trees but ive flown at a baseball field and i cant even go from home plate to the outfield fence without almost completely losing video.
fpv,fek8y72,t1_fek8lgh,1579195081.0,"Unfortunately not, the panel is facing forward on my goggles and the other antenna on my goggles is an omni directional. The Dipole on my drone points up at about a 45 degree angle on the back of the quad.  I was looking to get a 90 degree adapter with the new antennas to point the one on my drone straight up."
fpv,fek8dtq,t3_eplm9x,1579194746.0,"Yeah, I've been through betaflight and the OSD. I get perfect signal until about 75 yards and it starts flickering and after that it just gets worse and worse. 

I've been running channel 8, band A at 5725mhz. I've tried switching it up through betaflight then through the goggles but it doesnt seem to change anything. 

I know the VTX is setting to the correct power levels. 

I've seen other forums where people say the stock panel/patch antenna it comes with is pretty bad."
fpv,fek4g7q,t3_eplgdx,1579192399.0,"Im waiting on a reply for my post about my Eachine goggles, but i would do yourself a favor now and get some better antenna for the eachine because they seem pretty bad. I only get around 100 yards of range out of my stock antenna. 

I asked if that was normal and if better antenna would fix it. Ill edit my comment when someone answers that"
todayilearned,fejjnxe,t1_fejdoyn,1579177055.0,"Yeah no thanks, i mean we've at least got black widows and copperheads to worry about, just off the top of my head most common venomous things. I live out in the woods so i see both fairly often but I'd take those everyday over what you guys have."
todayilearned,fejdkaz,t1_fejbp54,1579168777.0,The ones in the USA arent dangerous to humans. Europe has the Hobo spider which can be potentially dangerous to humans. You guys just got the short end of the stick with literally almost everything being deadly down there
todayilearned,fejblk4,t1_fej5a6o,1579165795.0,"We have funnel spiders in the USA too, i don't know if they're deadly here or not though."
AskReddit,fe7q7ei,t1_fe6fp7z,1578917869.0,"I got my Technician class license for FPV drome flying and it was so easy! I learned so much just studying for the Technician level exam, it made me want to go further into the hobby. I haven't, because I'm really involved in my drones, but its something i have to fall back on! Only took me a few days of studying to get the license too.

Edit: However, you cannot take the HAM tests online. You would have to go to your local radio club and take the tests in person."
EscapefromTarkov,fe7laav,t1_fe7ets0,1578916088.0,"I thought about that but i just get wrecked when i do factory. I need to offline it and get a feel for it, ive been going customs almost non stop just trying to get a feel for everything again"
fpv,fe7k80c,t1_fe7jjr4,1578915743.0,"I watched that the other day and completely missed that, wow. There really are no ethics in Ethix. Dude just seems like a standard youtube tool now.

It also seems like they play it off like they're using spotters in their videos but the way they fly, theres no way a spotter would be able to see anything they're doing. I generally dont use a spotter but thats because i just fly at my house and the only people i need to worry about are my fiance and daughter who arent even outside while i fly. If i go to a park or something i generally bring someone with me. If im flying at 50+mph in short ranges, its really hard to see anyone walking in the general vicinity."
fpv,fe7j7oh,t1_fe6rp1e,1578915298.0,All it takes is a handful of maintstream idiots to hook a bunch of amateurs into doing the same things. Then you have a large portion of the community flying unsafely trying to mirror their favorite fpv youtubers.
fpv,fe7j059,t1_fe6rim2,1578915206.0,"Thats kind of how i feel about Mr Steele. I mean i havent seen him really say anything about the regulations but what he and his friends do is absolutely damaging to the hobby especially since hes one of the biggest fpv youtubers. 

Going to commercial parks that are closed for the weekend are decent places to fly but definitely not legal. They're constantly diving office buildings in the middle of the city, flying over streets and shit in the middle of the city. It just seems like they have no fucks to give except the money and youtube likes. 

I was a fan of Mr Steele when i first started but i cant stand him now. I try to follow as many rules as i can to help protect myself and the hobby but all they do is damage it and promote unsafe flying."
fpv,fe7gdw6,t1_fe6hszj,1578914297.0,"Honestly, if they introduce remote id, which im sure they will, i think DJI's approach would be the best way to go. I dont want a subscription to fly, i dont want to have to login every time i want to fly. If i have to add just add another small receiver looking piece to my drone for remote id, then so be it. It should be done through bluetooth or wifi, not cellular data. You shouldnt have to pay monthly just to fly especially if you're like me who only flies on your property. 

I really dont like the idea of my location being broadcast to whoever can get to that information but i also want this hobby to stay alive and be enjoyable for years to come, which would mean leaving out overly complicated and expensive regulations."

Almost never have to use more than the 10 rounds unless i miss a few shots and its a fairly cheap gun to keep around, never gets sold out because i assume people really dont like the standard sks"
EscapefromTarkov,fe2u91n,t3_enopdg,1578842923.0,"I generally run solo but would be cool to play with someone if you're down for a duo, if we can get more that would be cool too. I've already gotten 3 raids in today with a handful of weapons and gear but im only level 2.

We took both with us to our new house and got comcast out to install internet and cable. They told us the other modem was still registered to my moms account and the only way to take it off was to get her approval to remove every device from her account and start over.
