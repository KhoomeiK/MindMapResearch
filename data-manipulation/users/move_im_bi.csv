Divorce,felptii,t1_felax1j,1579228001.0,"Ugh that’s rough, I’m sorry you’re going through that. But it’s good you have the upper hand financially! I unfortunately did not so I literally grabbed the essentials and walked away (still in the process of divorcing) and my ex made me quit my job, so that was no good. Personally I would maybe see if you could find an attorney that does free consultations, that way you could see what your rights are and they maybe could predict if your spouse would have any chance at your assets or income that way you can make an informed decision and prepare if you do decide to leave. I’m no professional, just someone who’s been in your shoes, but one thing I know for certain is it takes two people to make a marriage work, and it sound like your SO isn’t holding up his end of the bargain. 

Edit: also, even if you do need to pay consultation fees it may be worth speaking to multiple attorneys (the most highly esteemed ones) because as far as I know that bars your ex from using their services."
Divorce,feko4of,t3_epmpa7,1579204102.0,"Honestly, it sounds like he’s pretty emotionally manipulative. I know how much that hurts (I’ve been through it myself a few times). It’s not ok for him to guilt you constantly over something you don’t/didn’t do. It’s not okay for him to make fun of you for the things that bring you joy (ie silly subs). And obviously you’re really hurting because normal people don’t ask for divorces over little shit. And he made have had y’all move to a new city purposely to isolate you from your support network. It’s a lot harder for abused to leave the abuser without the support of others but that does not mean it’s impossible. 

And honestly, not to scare you but I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s projecting with the cheating thing. If you guys have unprotected sex I would highly recommend getting tested for peace of mind. And maybe watch him for other signs of cheating, that way, legally depending on what state you’re in, if you have proof you can get an at fault divorce much quicker than a no-fault one. Also, if he controls the finances I would highly highly recommend opening an account or start stashing cash, something, in a way that he can’t find out about it. Financial abuse happens in 99% of abusive relationships. 

TBH, I wouldn’t worry about trying to understand what’s going on in his head because if he’s truly on the NPD spectrum he may not have a regular capacity for empathy anyways and that will reveal its self more and more the longer you stay. Like it’s weird, people like that don’t have the same social boundaries as neurotypical people. Like you and I may say “oh I would never treat someone that way! That would make them feel horrible!” But it wouldn’t even occur for N people to even think that way. 

I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. No matter what please remember his actions aren’t your fault. My inbox is open if you ever need someone to talk to."

Divorce,fehmnjp,t3_ep4x39,1579119637.0,"I’m (22F) and currently in the divorce process, I put it in my bio like so: 

“COOL THINGS IVE DONE:
- hobbies
-randomly interesting occurrences blah blah blah 
-left a bad marriage 
- other cool things etc., etc.” 

The person I’m talking to now, (21 m)that I actually really like sent something like this as an icebreaker to me “my parents split up when I was young so I consider myself an expert on loving divorced people!” Made me laugh and it was nice to immediately know he wasn’t going to be put off by it. 

Hope this helps, OP. Good luck out there."
relationship_advice,fdyqfm9,t3_en9heq,1578782505.0,"OP- I don’t know if your wife ever struggled with anything like post-partum depression or struggled at all after she had the baby. Pregnancy and childbirth is a massive strain on women physically and mentally, and at times when she was struggling she may have truly felt that way because she was temporarily mentally ill (or might be) and was recalling a memory that night. Or while she was drunk if she was with single friends she might have gotten jealous because the grass is always greener, you know? 

I’m sorry she said that to you. It’s awful and no one deserves that. And not trying to make excuses for her or anything but if you’re wondering where that statement came from that would be my guess as to the source. I would give it a few days and then maybe ask her about how she’s feeling now and how she felt back then to get some insight as to where she is mental-health wise."
RightwingLGBT,fdo2e2z,t3_em8b1k,1578597629.0,"Yeah I’m thinking about leaving that subreddit all together because it is predominantly trans pertinent, which no hate or disrespect here; but, personally I’m divorcing a person who was highly abusive to me while I was married to them that happens to be trans and so having trans-specific issues and debates pop up on my feed non-stop has been slightly triggering for me."
