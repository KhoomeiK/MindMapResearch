Wait until you have your own place."
tifu,fesd4ru,t1_fernkvm,1579364027.0,That's horrible!
tifu,ferfgzs,t3_eq95jr,1579353300.0,"Similar conditiong with toddler twins when they stopped napping. I used to set everyone up in the living room to watch a movie so they'd at least have some down time. I would sit with them, and always fall asleep (three kids under 4 and a full-time work-from-home job that I did mostly at night after everyone was in bed). To this day, there are Disney movies that will knock me out as soon as the opening scenes play."
computer,fer4pjg,t3_eqed42,1579349764.0,"I had this problem with my Dell XPS12. Check the manufacturer website to see if there are driver updates. After I updated all the drivers (after Googling the problem) the situation resolved. Most manufacturers also have some form of online support that allows you to detect your computer (sometimes you have to install a piece of software to help, or input your serial number) which will allow you to easily download updated stuff specific to your computer make and model.

Edit: To caution you only to download drivers from a manufacturer website, and to note that drivers have to be installed in a particular order which Asus should have info about on their website."
LifeProTips,fer38sj,t1_feqjddj,1579349239.0,"You never know what lacks people have had in their lives to cause them to save things. Your mom would have been too young, but my mom lived through the depression. She used to save any shiny piece of paper that came her way. When I got a present for Christmas wrapped in shiney, metallic paper, I knew it was going to be something really special!"

personalfinance,fdhzjyn,t1_fdhpj60,1578433038.0,"OP said it was 4 years as a cook with 1099. So, that would be 2016-2019. Given the indicated income, that won't  be hundreds of thousands of tax due."
personalfinance,fdhomfy,t1_fdhh742,1578427055.0,Absolutely this. Though if it were me I'd file for all the years worked for 1099-MISC income.
cats,fdfgbcu,t3_el2zba,1578361031.0,You don't ever need to bathe a cat unless they get into something toxic that they shouldn't lick off.
personalfinance,fd2i1f6,t1_fd1xm7s,1578147526.0,"Why ""shouldn't"" this young person have a job? Learning about how to make money working is best taught by working. There is nothing like working to learn the value of money. That aha moment when you realize ""This purchase amounts to x hours of work"" Learning how to get everything done while working is best learned working while having to get things done-being in school and working is reality for most college students, so why not practice in high school? Finding ways to earn money sets your brain on the path of being able to see opportunity. The world is constantly changing, and you need to be able to adapt if the field you are in tanks and you need a different job."
personalfinance,fd2fl86,t3_ejgu1o,1578146501.0,You know you don't have to roll over your 401k? You can open a new IRA for new contributions. Look at what investments your 401K money is in before you decide.

LifeProTips,fcu2ryn,t3_eioanh,1577970760.0,"The only thing in this article that makes no sense is the idea of suggesting a desired event happen some time in the future. Toddlers live in the now-they wouldn't understand ""tomorrow after your nap"" All times that are not now are a no!"

cats,fcnhnz5,t3_ei4ym4,1577811915.0,"You have two choices. You can put some serious time and effort into trying to socialize your socially anxious cat into your family, or you can re-home her. You could start by giving her a safe, dog-free space to eat, sleep and toilet in. If she is able to calm down there, you can progressively increase interactions between her and the other animals. Pretend you are introducing her as  a new animal in your home-there is a lot of good information out there about how to do that. Spend some time watching ""my cat from hell"" or videos by Jackson Galaxy.  There is also the kitten lady on youtube. You wil have to put some work in to understand your home dynamic and your cat and how to make them work together. 

Animals are like people in that they have their own personalities. Even if you make an effort to socialize her, you may come to realize that she is not suited to your home. If you genuinely care about the well being of your cat, you may find it is her best interests to rehome her."
cats,fclsdw1,t1_fclij06,1577755306.0,My thoughts are along this line also. I would never do something to an animal I love that made them feel bad and sick when they can have no comprehension why.

I'd second the advice to thoroughly clean with an enzymatic cleaner everyplace there is pee. If there is pee on carpet you may need to rent a steam cleaner to get the pee out. And also the cat attract litter."

books,fcg8ija,t1_fcer5u6,1577637611.0,"I did read the post. Poster feels guilty about buying from Amazon and not supporting the local bookstore, but doesn't support the local bookstore because of the hit to the wallet. The suggestion to purchase neither from Amazon nor the local bookstore but rather use the library addresses both concerns. Perhaps suggesting only browsing at the bookstore is not helpful, given the poster's desire to support the local business. But I would argue supporting your local library is important, too."
books,fcg7ax2,t1_fcbisf6,1577637130.0,"I would agree that my response does not address the ethical dilemma directly. I'll enlarge on my post by saying that I don't ever buy books except to gift them, and even then I try to find them used. I use my library if I need something to read. I am lucky that it is a large county library with many branches, and even new books are available if you are willing to wait for them. Plus their inter-library loan services are excellent, and I can borrow digital material also.

I am trying very, very hard not acquire any more stuff, and books count as stuff regardless of where they are purchased. Even digital books count as stuff. I already have a lifetime of stuff I need to deal with before I die so it doesnt become someone else's problem."
books,fcg4d2o,t1_fcbe2v7,1577636386.0,Because they are organized by subject. And they have all the newest works.

personalfinance,fbwhbaf,t1_fbwcbw6,1577149921.0,You need to let the IRS know your ssn was stolen. A common use for stolen ssns is to file fraudulent tax returns claiming large refunds. If you alert the  IRS they will notify you if a return is filed in your name. Ther is a form you have to fill out and submit.
