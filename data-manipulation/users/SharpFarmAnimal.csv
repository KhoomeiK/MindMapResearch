PublicFreakout,ffr0yka,t1_ffqxldx,1580148054.0,All I was saying was it's annoying when people are freshly hired and go straight to doing the bare minimum while complaining they arnt getting paid enough. I'm well aware our system is messed up but you still have to actually prove yourself if you expect your employer to treat you decently. I'm not making a case for the minimum wage rate
