AmItheAsshole,ff7sp5j,t3_es4qij,1579657424.0,"NTA I had some teachers show us violent films way too young in school, freshman year my teacher showed us Amistad. It made me nauseous. My sophomore year health teacher showed us a fake film of a college student getting raped. I think schools need to be more careful about what theyâ€™re showing young students, it can be traumatizing and all kids are different. They should be warned and given the option to walk out."

AmItheAsshole,ff596rd,t3_erpotc,1579584006.0,"NTA I adopted my dog for free but I truly donâ€™t understand this mentality, a dog someone pays for needs a home just as badly as a dog in a shelter. They all deserve great homes and I donâ€™t think it matters how much someone pays, just that theyâ€™re loving and caring for their dog. If your dog is loved, nothing else matters."

AmItheAsshole,ff586zs,t1_ff56egq,1579583095.0,"I highly doubt that you did that at all. Like I said, Iâ€™m sure your perception of how engaging you are is completely inaccurate- otherwise you wouldnâ€™t be talking shit about people youâ€™re jealous of. Not everyone is able to do it because it is based on effort. You couldnâ€™t put in the effort and you failed."
AmItheAsshole,ff565od,t3_erpeq6,1579581335.0,"YTA itâ€™s actually really bizarre to me that you openly admit youâ€™re jealous because you tried and failed, but are still trying to say theyâ€™re just â€œlucky.â€ To be internet famous you have to really know how to engage with people and what draws them in. You have to know current trends and move with them, you have to be extremely engaged. Itâ€™s a lot of work because they sacrifice real life to internet life and it pays off lol. You probably donâ€™t have as great of social skills as you think. I mean itâ€™s pretty clear by the way you just HAD to sound superior to your friends. I canâ€™t imagine someone like you being internet famous. You seem like the type whoâ€™s always making a point no one cares about or asked for."

If sheâ€™s taking care of the rest of the apartment, and isnâ€™t destroying her room, there really shouldnâ€™t be an issue. I also donâ€™t understand why it would be a problem if she did want to leave after a year. You pretty much demanded she stop what she was doing and talk to you about something that wasnâ€™t an issue. That was really rude of you. If thatâ€™s how you talk to your roommates itâ€™s no surprise so many have left. This shouldnâ€™t be so concerning to you. Stop treating her like a child, this is your roommate."

AmItheAsshole,ff4yyhv,t1_ff4ynoz,1579575827.0,"I think you should start ASAP! I started taking my dog on longer, slower walks so he could go at his own pace. We used to walk for 10-15 mins, now theyâ€™re an average of 30-60 mins and he loves to run! There is hope but you do need to be consistent. Nothing is better than seeing your dog healthy, happy and with lots of energy! Sorry if Iâ€™m preaching to the choir, good luck with everything. Maybe you could show his mom some articles about what happens when dogs eat the wrong human food :/"
AmItheAsshole,ff4yh75,t3_erobkh,1579575491.0,"YWBTA I donâ€™t think locking him in your room is a good solution. Heâ€™s going to need more walks and less food once you move anyway, start getting him more exercise now. Give him less food and when you move heâ€™ll already be a little more active. Also Jesus Christ 20 pound chihuahua mix, that is huge. My chihuahua mix looked huge at 17 pounds but he lost weight with more walks and less food. Iâ€™m not defending his mom btw, her actions are so unhealthy to your pup."

OP is asking a lot of this person and I donâ€™t think the presence of a stranger in the waiting room will make a huge difference. It does seem like something reasonable OP could put up with considering this is such a huge favor being done. OP isnâ€™t an AH for having these feelings but I do think she would be if this wasnâ€™t brought up until the girlfriend is already there.
AmItheAsshole,ff3f9qb,t3_erfxk3,1579539869.0,"YTA Heâ€™s doing you a huge favor that he doesnâ€™t have to do. I donâ€™t see how her presence in the waiting room will have any affect on you. You wonâ€™t really remember seeing her when you wake up anyway. It does sound like insecurity, because if this were really your family you wouldnâ€™t care. I guess Iâ€™m alone here but youâ€™re coming off as possessive of someone youâ€™re no longer with. I guess youâ€™ll find out by his reaction when you tell him."
