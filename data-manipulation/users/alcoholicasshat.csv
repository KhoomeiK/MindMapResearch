Just like Russia and China, and Australia our country is too big to generalize us all *accurately.* A lot of us want to see Trump out of office but we simply can't make the changes as fast as they are needed.

If Donald Trump did something extreme enough that went against the interests of the majority \[thinking of the WWIII speculations from weeks back\] I can pretty much guarantee that he would be assassinated. Right now we are removing him in the most civil/constitutional way possible to save face."
