Also the completed mission logs are splendid, detailed and pretty funny to read too since they're written in Dandelion's ""voice"", so it's not painful to go read them and refresh one's memory.

As for the rest, I'm not a min-maxer, trying to stick to a perfect build. I like the feel of quick attacks and igni, so I just pick equipment and skills that favor those.

There are some games where I do that, but it's usually management games, like Rimworld, where I dump the old game because it's become too cumbersome and taxing to keep up with. and then I can't pick it back up because I don't remember who's good at what. But something like Witcher, the gameplay doesn't get broader, even the skills are mostly passive.
