classicwow,ffhrd0f,t3_etp0cw,1579949870.0,"Damn. Back in the day I had a guy make a guild called ""Plague sucks"", Plague being my name. I messaged a gm and 15 minutes the later I got contacted by the gm saying he solved the issue and I should contact them again if the other guy tried anything else. Sucks to see how little they care now"

history,ff8r1ol,t1_ff8f827,1579692589.0,I was born on the 27th of December of 1992. My parents made me join class with everyone else of the year 92. I was either a full year or half a year behind everyone else. I always wonder if I could have done better if they had held me back a year. I'm kinda salty about it tbh
darksouls,ff5ws47,t1_ff5k448,1579612855.0,I'm not even ashamed to admit it took me 127 tries to kill him the first time. I wasn't even angry at the fight at all tbh. Easily my favorite game fight ever

classicwow,fegg1l6,t1_fegciu1,1579091542.0,Pretty sure you can hire 5 people to monitor a server group. 5 guys for about 10 servers seems alright considering all they have to do is check up once in a while

todayilearned,fe7l3u1,t1_fe6zk6r,1578916018.0,"No but still, there was murder and death, just on a way smaller scale. I get the point you're trying to make and somewhat agree with it, but killing is killing isn't it? No matter if someone did it to others and another group did it to ""distant relatives""."
todayilearned,fe6rfpc,t1_fe5rxxp,1578901870.0,Can you honestly claim that not even once in history that the tribe you're descendant from has destroyed another tribe that used to live where they wanted to live? Even if it's small scale or within the current borders we set there have always been invasions and land stealing. Or is it okay if it's small scale?

todayilearned,fe4tuf0,t1_fe4m5z3,1578862714.0,"Mate, how new are you to history? All of it it filled with someone occupying someone else's land. The very land you're living on is stolen from some other ethnic group. Try to look at history from their point of view, not ours"

history,fdyzmxz,t1_fdxjjyu,1578785222.0,"Fun fact about those farmers in Belgium. Most of them find so much bombs and crap that just pile em up somewhere and call DOVO (mine dismantle team) once they think they have enough crap worth calling someone over for. Source, I know a few people there and went to a farmer who had loads of bombs laying around"

todayilearned,fdptajl,t1_fdpsepe,1578639623.0,Why? English is piss easy. And easy to learn as well considering there are millions of movies and songs that can help you learn the language and pronunciation. This comes from a guy who has learned English as a second language.

Notifications menu seems pretty good to me as well. Every samsung I've ever had was extremely slow, was missing certain dictionaries, and made me angry as hell tbh. Each to their own I guess"
