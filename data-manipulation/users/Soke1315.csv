clevercomebacks,ffretyv,t1_ffr9we4,1580156647.0,Yeah my sisters pregnant right now (she was 5ft8 and weighed 115 before) and she didn't start showing will 35/36 weeks. Her last baby was 9 pounds too but I swear she carried towards her back or soemthing becuase you couldn't tell
VeganFoodPorn,ffq4s96,t1_ffq4npk,1580120468.0,Yes I'm aware. But I Never implied or said that. All I said was I would hope it would be natural and not harmful.
ATBGE,ffpuyd2,t3_eudpo2,1580106684.0,I would need to change some things to be able to wear this. Maybe go for a more alternative/grunge/punk style with it. Make this look kinda grungy with a razor taken too it to give the appearance of worn out areas. then add a bunch of cool punk like patches and some studs around the borders (or spikes) as well as make my own belt type thing for up top that matches. but also somehow cut part of the waist then add another fabric probably just fishnet to the waist to make it not seem so damn long.  Maybe just maybe then I would consider throwing it in the trash and never speaking of that mistake again.
3Dprinting,ffpuk53,t3_eugkx8,1580106261.0,I would use this for my keys and wallet so I stop losing them lmao would never forget to put them there becuase it would be so much fun! I want one so bad. Hopefully one day soonish I'll have enough saved up for a printer. For now I at least get to enjoy all the cool stuff people here make!

SexWorkers,ffpr7bx,t1_ffnmnf4,1580102829.0,Wow i really hope one day you can discover yourself so you're not so disgusting towards those that have found their true self. Also maybe try to be a little bit less filled with negativity and hate. Work on your own life. NO ONE on Reddit needs you whining and acting like this just becuase you're not happy with your own life. Find another healthier outlet.
SexWorkers,ffpqwhk,t1_ffiz9fl,1580102542.0,That's not at all how any of this works. So a gay guy has vagina one time and hates it. So guess what? he's still gay! That one time didn't turn him straight. Also most men/women are comfortable with their own sexuality becuase they have either thought it out or experimented. The fact that you're so upset by even another person just talking about it means you may need to look inside yourself to see why this *really* bothers you so much. Then come back and talk when you're *comfortable* with your own *sexuality* .
SexWorkers,ffpqc4g,t1_ffjvrkd,1580102014.0,"Almost every (straight) guy I have talked to about sexuality has questioned there's at one point in their life some with just a thought others experimenting.

China_Flu,ffpljyo,t1_ffnvdun,1580098044.0,Actually they said the corona virus can be spread through breathing (moisture released in breath) so yeah that's why it spreads so easy. It might not stay airborne forever but it can for a bit.

China_Flu,ffpkxtt,t1_ffp84f8,1580097576.0,"I tell my kids this all the time. They acrually enjoy learning about bacteria and viruses thankfully so we like to watch educational short clips on it then talk about how to prevent yourself from getting sick. They are 6 and 4. They both always wash their hands throughout the day and each have a mini bottle of sanitizer in case they need to itch their face or if their hands get dirty and they cant get to a sink. I swear they rarely get sick now compared to when we weren't doing this together a while ago. They got sick last year twice which is great becuase they were getting sick it seemed every few weeks bringing soemthing home from school. They both missed the max amount of days the year before last (pre k didn't care as much its a 2 year pre k but my other son was in a special education so it Was important he didn't miss) but I refuse to send my kid knowing he's still contagious (any fever, vomit, poos, and must be on antibiotics for bacterial stuff for 24 hours) rather work with him at home and make the school mad at me then send him for it to make others sick and also take it home to possibly immune compromised grandma or baby brother. Its b.s. they won't take your word either. I only tsle my kids if kts not manageable at home or I know they are super ill and need meds. But why go in for a cold or the flu when there's nothing they can do but treat symptoms if it gets bad? You're just risking getting more sick or getting others there sick by going.  My youngest was hospitalized at 2 months old after his brother brought rsv home and it was severe enough he was on oxygen and feeding tubes that one I knew with in 24 hours it esd going to get bad and sure enough 48ish hours later I had to tsje him to thr hospital becuase he sounded like a bowl of rice crispies crackling and popping trying to breathe. 2 weeks of hell for him in the hospital them anpthe couple weeks to be over it 100% all becuase someone sent their perfect attendance sick kid to school more then likely. So yeah wish more people would keep their hands away from those 4 areas as well as wash & sanitize as much as possible and stay home if you're sick or have been around sick people! Alot of spread could be cut down so much if people Did those things regularly but alot don't sadly."
China_Flu,ffpisi7,t1_ffnx4ya,1580096050.0,When you breathe wouldn't you release moisture though? I wouldn't want to be near someome infected even if they were only breathing with no coughing/sneezing.

quityourbullshit,ffokpo3,t3_eu8yv6,1580078658.0,"I agree with you what a pos. But have had my cousin deal with cos snd it was bullshit. He raised his daughter co parenting with a 1 night stand. Paid support even though they didn't go to court. Then the mom starts doing drugs with her new bf when his kid turns 5. She was here weekly and our whole family miss her its been months. Foster care took her. Her new bf was apparently a guy dhe dated before screwing my cousin so she lied to him and said it was her daughter. So they stopped allowing weekly visits (she even let us keep her for weeks when she needed a break. Custody was pretty much 60/40 with my cousin having more time) well I guess the strws of actually being a parent 247 caught up with her and the drugs. So when she got into trouble she just gave them the kids. Didn't fight it at all. My cousin was blockwd on everyrhing and trying to find a way to see his daughter. He kept making new accounts to ask her but just got blocked. Untill he noticed one week that she was constantly posting pictures of herslef and her bf at bars or out somewhere obviously high. My brother called around and demanded a DNA test to prove what we already knew (sbe looks nothing like the mother looks exactly like my brother so we never once doubted it. Even if it had csme back negative we planned to fight to be able to see her at least becuase she's family and we love her no matter what. Can't just take 5 years away from someone) well came back as his kid. Now hes battling one cps lady who seems to want to adopt his kid to another family. When she has a perfectly for father that she was stolen away from. He's passer everything with flying colors. But she just texted the other day saying that its too much and they have to cut back visits becuase HIS DAUGHTER is constantly begging to come home to see her daddy (apparently that's a bad thing? Guess its pissing off thefoster parents from what she said) it's killing all of us. The therapist disagrees with the cps worker and says she thinks if anything he needs more then twice a week visits. She's all for her coming home. But its like the cps worker is going to get a bigher paycheck to place her in a permanent adoptive home ( I would hope not but that's how she acts) she has been so terrible to my brother this whole time and I didn't believe him till I saw the texts. Hurt my heart to read it all when I know where this little girl belongs. Around her family. With her dad who's never touched drugs and doesn't even smoke or drink as well as has a good job a house and has already bought her sxhool supplies and talked to the school about getting her in asap when she's home. Yet that lady seriously seems to want to rip a family apsrt. I cried when I saw the video of my little cosuins kiddo running at him crying her eyes out saying ""please take me back home daddy I want to stay with you forever. Don't make me go back with "" insert foster parents names"" or back to mommy's please just take me home now."" I miss that little girl alot too she literally grew up next to my sons and my sisters kids too. They were all best friends and near the same ages. (6,6,4&3) in the one who baby sat when he had to work. I got her to walk for the 1st time and still have that video saved on my camera. I can't stand the thoughg of her livinv with strangers as well as the possibility of not seeinv her ever again untill shes 18 and that's if she chooses to see us after so long. God I am thankful for thevones the system saves and while I'm glad they got her away from the mom as we had no clue how bad it was it sucks that she stole away her from my cousin before it all happened and they didn't even check for a father anywhere. Her last name wws literally his last nsme untill the crazy mom changed it 2 months ago...."

morbidquestions,ffnq6my,t3_eu3t28,1580069260.0,Suicide with overdose and have them write a note before hand. You write one too and just say you want to see who could come up with the best/most believable suicide note. Then spike their drink with whatever you plan to OD them with. Leave their note Then leave and come back later to call cops. Make sure its late st night or something and that its in an area where there's no cameras and not alot of neighbors. Also make sure thet are dead before you call it in.

I'm 8 months pregnant with my last baby . they said I have no choice and have to get a c section as the risk js too high. For that reasom and a fee medical issues I'm a high risk pregnancy. Getting a c section sounds like the worst snd most scary part out of everything I have been through with childbirth. Idk how women can have such a major surgery as well as take care of yourself and baby. It sounds impossible so I will say to the women who have had them YOU are a damn super women/amazing/bad ass!

AskDocs,ffn805f,t3_eu94ny,1580062982.0,I mean I would just to be safe cant hurt. You should see your primary care physician after such serious hospital visit anyways. Did that hospital tell you when to follow up with your own Dr? If not call anyway and get an appointment asap asap.
SuicideWatch,ffn5mp2,t1_ffn4j48,1580062261.0,Thanks man just wanted to make sure I am not too out of it. Again thanks for the info I do really appreciate you taking the time to explain it well. Hope you have a great week
SuicideWatch,ffn495v,t1_ffn3ksn,1580061911.0,Yeah I agree completely with that here and understand you thanks for the perspective I appreciate it. Also sorry if I haven't been making alot of sense in responses btw i havent slept in 2 days due to illness so I'm sorry if it was hard to read anything I said
RedditLaqueristas,ffn367v,t1_ffn15kj,1580061539.0,Oh sorry! It looks whitish but Honeslty that sounds even better. I just like the contrast from light to dark snd the thumb really makes the other colors pop for me. I just love the whole look in general have never seen it before and am new here (actually new to all of it just started doing it this past year). I just started growing out my nails and painting them recently last spring. Was a tomboy most my life and always kept my nails super short and plain. But decided to try it out and love it. People now think my nails are fake and I went and got a gel mani (I'm not suprised jts a big change from how my nails used to look lol) so it makes me feel good and I'm loving learning all the ways you can do nails.
SuicideWatch,ffn29jx,t1_ffn0uud,1580061204.0,Of course to a person who talks to you or you know I agree with that statement. But if you don't know them then they can be hard which is why I was just saying kind words anytime can be helpful sorry I really should be more thorough and explain myself better like you did.  If more were kind to strangers that can sometimes really help some. There are many people sadly who only have negative horrible people in there life's and just having a stranger say something nice can help them. It helped me but I know everyone is different and it all depends on the situation and what all eas going on. For me it made me realize there are nice and good people out there and that I'm not a terrible person like I was made to believe.  But yes of course if someone actually vents to you or you personally are friends with them and can tell they are struggling you should listen 1 st then be as supportive as you can In what you say and not just give a short blanket type statement.
SuicideWatch,ffmzsso,t1_ffmzhgv,1580060565.0,Sorry my bad I thought at 1st part of that was also directed at my statement.  But again thanks for sharing that info I see now how it can be bad for threads online when someone needs help vs in person.
SuicideWatch,ffmyrfh,t1_ffmw7a9,1580060235.0,Don't know why you downvoted me though when i actually didn't only say a simple statement and was trying to be helpful. Didnt think what I said could be considered a simple statement. Tried to be supportive.
SuicideWatch,ffmy69z,t3_eu50ee,1580060134.0,I see your point if that's what all the comments were. I didn't think about it from that perspective. Also yeah In person is alot different like what I shared with the simplicity of kindness helping me. Thanks for the perspective appreciate you taking the time to explain it well.
DiagnoseMe,ffmxnbq,t3_eu5uo4,1580059962.0,Also depression can easily be caused from anorher illness rather then your symptoms coming from it. Instead if may be a symptom. I hope a specialist or regular Dr can get you answer asap and get you feeling better . Ask about taking vit C as wl as get some bloodwork done for anything they may want to test for but ask if they can also test for any vitamin Deficiencies. That stuff helped me feel better too a long with getting my machine. Too many see will think depression is the cause snd not just a symptoms I as well am diagnosed with depression and I had to switch Dr so I could see a specialist and I'm so glad I'm done with that and feeling better.don't give up even if you have to get a 3rd or a 10th opinion. Drs are amazing but they are also only human. My sister went almost 20 years being misdiagnosed with a severe illness   that thankfully now shes getting treatment for. but if she had gotten it hears ago she would be doing alt better by now.
DiagnoseMe,ffmuzvc,t3_eu5uo4,1580059253.0,Get a sleep study done. I felt the same and so did my ex from years ago. We both had sleep apnea. Thsts why I felt so out of it according to Dr anytime I tried to get into a deep rem sleep I stopped brrsrhjng and my body would back off from deep sleep to just sleepinv like I'm taking s nap. So j wasn't getting the sleep j needed to mentalky or physically function properly. I would see a neurologist too after asking your primary care physician for referrals
RedditLaqueristas,ffmu98l,t3_eu7o0d,1580058979.0,Love this so much the white thump really makes all those purples POP! Aweome mani idea love it. Thank you for sharing the picture and the colors you used :)
SuicideWatch,ffmtsmq,t1_ffmfdnd,1580058798.0,"How not? Sometimes all it takes is others reminding you that you're important and mean something. Some people go years without hearing it. I did and was so done that I felt like I was already dead and this was my punishment. Everyday was a struggle not to end it kept holding onto the fact that may be someone would care one day. Then It helped me to have total strangers be nice to me when I got away from a bad situation. For years all I had heard was negative  terrible things directed at me. Then when I got away from being controlled and got a new job where I wasn't scared to talk to people (I never talked to anyone other then about work at my old job. People knew to leave me alone thankfully it was out of fear the one that was controlling me would find out and I didn't want to add more reasons for abuse) it was crazy that those people that didn't even know me could be so kind compared to the one who was supposed to love me but instead controlled and manipulated me. Those strangers don't even know just by saying hi and giving a simple compliment or Honeslty just talking to me in a nice tone and not a hateful one it made me question if my severe daily thoughts on suicide were worth it or if maybe I was actually worth something and could one day be happy. While yes I'm sure alot of the time it won't change their minds but it also won't hurt. Imo it is Honeslty better to say a few kind words then saying nothing at all.  I really hope too that the OP realizes how important they truly are and that they just need to reach out for support. No one should have to try to get through it alone. When your brains chemistry is messed up it makes you think you're out of options. Its just impossible to see things the way the your true self usually would. But you aren't out of options you just need help getting that chemistry fixed so you can look at your problems in a better state of mind and work with a professional to obtain the goals that will make you happy. It's not easy I wont lie. But its worth it and I'm saying this from a perspective that still has a long ways to go to just be ""ok"" everyday. I want to be happy one day. I hope you are able to get the support you need OP. No one deserves to suffer like that. I wish I could say or do something to help you but I know I can't
 So i hope soemone near you can help you see the light at the end of what seemed like a never ending dark tunnel."
Coronavirus,ffmm352,t1_ffmki30,1580056525.0,"Thanks I Have somewhat but I gave up 8 years of my life so my ex could go to school and I took care it the kids 24/7 so he could start his own business. He promised if I did that for the family he would make sure I got to go back to school after for my own career choice becusee he knew I didn't want to be a stay at home mom and wife (had to take care pf him and all his needs too he didn't ever even wash hos own clothes or anything) well he finished started his business them things turned alot more sour then they had been. Verbal became physical and the rest is history. Still have alot to work on to be doing ""good"" but I'm doing ok now. So much better then I was though so there's that at least. Kids are dping way better in every aspect even their teachers said something. Wasn't s good environment for them and I wish I had gotten them away from him sooner but it was scary to think about being homeless. They were 4 and 1 and a half though so thankfully with a little children's therapy they are doing great now. Just wanted to share so others remember Sometimes people just don't know what will happen untill its too late and no one could have predicted it.

My ex tried it once but they did it in an apartment on the couch. His 1 st time and he did some that was supposed to be for ""veteran smokers"" like a dumbass. They specifically told him to take a small hit and not hit it like its pot. So his dumbass clears the bong..... It took 4 of his friends to keep him from jumping off the balcony while he freaked out thinking his friends were imposters so they were after him and that the world was closing in on him like the lid of a pizza box coming down. Once he came back down he was told he hit one friend in the ribs so they needed to go to the hospital becuase he couldn't breathe well. He said all he remembers was being scared becuase all their faces changed and then the roof came in on him so he knew he had to get away. Then he remembers coming to and being held down on the couch. But doesn't remember hitting his friend.  Btw Yep he fractured his friends rib. So he never did that again and luckily was super good friends with the guy he hurt or that could have ended up with him in jail. I heard that story more then once from his friends perspective but only got him to tell me about it once becuase he's embarrassed about it. Just don't do salvia without experienced people around to keep you from gettting hurt or hurting others."
funny,ffjyx72,t3_etzt4m,1580010788.0,RIP OP
illnessfakersgonewild,ffjxet5,t1_ffjwyvj,1580009589.0,Thank you for your kind words. Thankfully only one of my kids I had severe complications with I couldn't imagine having that happen again. Other times were for different things 2nd worst being hospitalized with a severe kidney issues. But yeah I know I shouldn't be embarrassed to have been so out of it and in pain I just hate thinkimg how others saw me like that and probably thought I was crazy or soemthing and that I probably looked and sounded like a big baby Idk. But anyways I'm Sorry you had to go through all that I'm hoping you're doing alot better now and never have to feel like that again! That's always so scary to deal with or look back on I'm sure (my few times were at least)
illnessfakersgonewild,ffjwch9,t1_ffjsz4g,1580008739.0,"I have had that pain only a few times in my life and I felt like an idiot looking back on it weeks later becuase i remember telling the Dr to please kill me or take me home to die. One of those times was severe complications during child birth that almost killed me and I had to have 2 surgeries for. I actually was told that time by my spouse days later becuase I don't remember it. He said I had asked the Dr to kill me that day too but also said I don't want to do this anymore can we stop and just keep the baby in. Embarrassing to think I said all that. I was so out of it but that one time I asked that a bunch I also lost alot of blood so I'm guessing that added to my pain and confusion. I also regret wanting to die but in that moment I would have been 100% happy to just die right away I remember wishing if there was a god he would take me right then and there.
 Crazy considering I'm one that hates the thought of death usually. So yeah I feel you on that and I hope you never have to experience  pain again bad enough to wish you were dead. I hope I don't either and I woudnt wish it on anyone."
medical_advice,ffjt4rz,t1_ffjrp8u,1580006233.0,I agree it's very unique and interesting! Doesn't look bad or wierd so that's a plus. Hopefully it doesn't impact vision or if it does it can be refixed somehow
whatisthisthing,ffjt061,t1_ffjsuee,1580006135.0,Yes a small one though idk if that matters but its always been a small fire as far as I have seen when she does it
blunderyears,ffjq3y0,t1_ffjplep,1580004099.0,"Ill check them out thank you! wish I could do this stuff it looks like it would be alot of fun but the only thing I have photo shopped was a ""stoned"" baked potato in computer lab in high school many years ago lol mine was terrible so I enjoy seeing others creations alot :)"
blunderyears,ffjpgj3,t1_ffjlyed,1580003666.0,Oh my that's awesome and so perfect. thank you for letting me see this wonderful picture lol
FiftyFifty,ffjpbul,t1_ffjoi6l,1580003575.0,It looked like he hit something else 1st but couldn't tell if he had or he just bounced off thr ground so was wondering if he did. Guess my brain sucks becuase is still can't tell in normal time if he did  or did not hit something on the way down
killedthecameraman,ffjkxaa,t1_ffjgej7,1580000595.0,Same what is going on im confused
peopleofwalmart,ffjgl0h,t3_etwn5y,1579997800.0,Mine doesn't say less then 20 or anything and alot have social anxiety so idc I just go to the lane listed as express at mine if I have like 20 it 10 under depending on the sign. But there are also like 30 self checkouts in my store some with full lanes
untrustworthypoptarts,ffjgcnq,t1_ffjg5jy,1579997662.0,Good to know thanks for taking the time to give me all that info!
AskDocs,ffjgapo,t3_etxpc3,1579997632.0,Any update?
untrustworthypoptarts,ffjfnjo,t1_ffj4ou0,1579997246.0,I thought it was only to dogs if ingested??
pointlesslygendered,ffjeryb,t3_etonbe,1579996729.0,But they are not the same are they? Maybe the other has alot more pages in it. Or the top one doesn't sell well so they lowered the price. I have seen pink tax many times (mainly on same brand razors and grooming supplies that are just different colors.) But I would want to see inside the book before saying its for sure pink tax here.
EntitledPeople,ffje85x,t3_etsvz0,1579996404.0,Damn she's stupid. Hope the lizards got a New home becusee whoever can date that must be just as if not more stupid then her. If she had any intelligence at all she wojld say she's selling a lizard set up and rehoming the lizards for free. That's what everyone does on all the sale sites im in that have this rule. Truly hope someone with experience who's not an idiot got those little guys to a new forever home.
medical_advice,ffjdxb2,t3_ety0kh,1579996232.0,What happened? Sorry just curious so you don't have to answer if you don't want too. im just wanting to learn what caused this. Hope someone can give you some helpful advice or lead you to a specialist who can. Ill invite so more See it hopefully good luck
blunderyears,ffjdbdk,t1_ffj7ven,1579995873.0,Love it. But someone please change all the other faces in the stain glass window to OPs blunder face and then it would be 100% perfect lol
whatisthisthing,ffjavc5,t1_ffirk1x,1579994448.0,Yeah my mom has a super nice fireplace that's pretty new and she can smoke a cigarette learning towards it (just right near it but doesn't have to put her head inside it or under or anytbing lol) and you can't smell any smoke at all. She only does it when its severe weather outside though as she prefers her porch that's all made up and nice. I was surprised the 1st time I saw her do it and she told me she had done it quite a few times. I never smelled it not even a little. I'm sure not all if it gets sucked up but enough you can't tell if you're a non smoker
insanepeoplefacebook,ffj9zj0,t3_etukp6,1579993901.0,There are already people who do this. Have heard of people calling one and either leaving the hospital before being seen or using it to see a Dr for a non emergency instead of calling a med cab that's also covered by insurance but apparently they can't call 48 hours before to notify them. They instead waste emts time as well as e.r. Drs time and back up the emergency department. I could understsnd if you don't have insurance as well as no possible ride from anyone and are sick not getting better as a last resort calling am ambulance but at least let them know what's up and don't lie so they don't rush to you for no reason. Have heard some stories from emts who have gotten calls from a frequent flyer for respiratory problems and then they get there to see its actually something simple like maybe they have a sore throat or whatever. so those guys & gals just risked safety to speed with lights and sirens to someone with a sore throat and put it as priority above others. One of my close friends was an emt for years before going back to school and becoming a nurse. They had so many stories of their own as well as for others and its insane what they have to deal with all of the time. People even attack them. While some are becuase they are so ill (like the old lady who was having a heart attack she told me about that took a crap load of people to restrain her and get her to hospital) the ones that shock and piss me off are the omes she told me about that were frequent flyers and faking or demanding drugs. She has so many terrible and gross stories idk how anyone can do that job so props to anyone who does you're a freaking super hero.
DiagnoseMe,ffj1xsl,t1_ffj0tt3,1579988344.0,See gp 1st if you're not happy with results then see a dermatologist since they specialize in just that that they see much more of a variety of skin issues and Will have more experience in this subject instead of a gp that just has some knowledge of alot of areas. I would deffinelty ask for them to run some tests like do a biopsy and some blood work as well. Although getting the biopsy does hurt a bit I would rather them take a tiny piece of skin and be 100% sure then just guess since so many of these skin conditions look similar. My spouse was misdiagnosed for a long time and struggled with horrid rashes and blistering untill he finally got sent to a dermatologist and they did a biopsy too get answers. Now he hasn't had anything since he used the meds they gave him in over a year.  He had seen many gp's before that and got all different answers that were all wrong. They all kept saying allergies or eczema ECT Drs are great and work hard to know all that they do but you must remember they are also human and Soemtiems they can only make an educated guess without doing any tests. Always get a 2nd or even 3 rd opinion by a specialist or another Dr if you have been dealing with being misdiagnosed. Good luck
RoleReversal,ffj0ezp,t1_ffiv0xu,1579987240.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words :) .I hope so we have been together for a while now but Honeslty I know  he's still healing/learning about himself from alot of years of dealing with terrible people. He says he feels like he lost his true self many years ago and it still searching for some pieces to feel completely like his true self. He also had some bad qualities (ones that were hurtful to him but too helpful to others) that he picked up trying to please those cruddy women so he was way to giving in every aspect and It took time to make him aware of it so he wasn't doing things just out of fear of me leaving but becuase he wants too. Wierd to say but I'm actually happy when he says no I don't feel like it or disagrees with me on soemthing and shares his own opinion so we can hear each others points of view in a good conversation. He's changed alot especially in the past year and I feel like his true self is finally showing instead of what he used to pretend or only show part of to please others. Hes the sweetest guy though and I'm super lucky I even met him. He's literally everything I want but couldn't find in men (some had a few of the qualities but not many of them or enough of them honestly) but yeah my main thing I love is that he's actually so open about his feelings with me. Being an open book is one big thing I struggled to see in most men I have dated. Makes me sad that so many men in society feel they have to act a certain way or hide things to be ""manly"". Just my opinion but I think its way better to just be yourself and not worry about ""gender rules"" in society although it can he hard to break free from that mindset after years of hearing it and being forced to be apart of it. I love that I can finally be the one to hold him and make him better becuase no other guy ever really let me or would say it made him feel like less of a man. But anyways yeah I'm super glad I found this sub makes me smile to see so many who feel similar or the same way. So many things I have read on here I agree with and are exaxtly how I feel about my relationship its crazy. I didn't know this was a thing and thought I was just wierd for a long time since so many I know dont have the Same mindset sadly."
RoleReversal,ffiugsx,t1_ffiube1,1579983020.0,He had quite a few ex's who only used him for money and cheated as well as openly made fun of his height. The type of chicks that say you have to be at least 6 foot. They were super cruel to him for years untill he stopped dating those type of women and got a backbone as well as became alot less shy.
RoleReversal,ffiube1,t1_ffiszxp,1579982913.0,Well he does for sure like some things in role reversal but sadly he's still kinda sensitive to his strength due to society being sucky he got bullied alot. I'm over 6 inches taller then him and it took a while just to get him to understand that I actually found him more attractive becuase of it not less. But I think he may take it the wrong way with this one. I'm not so great at explaining how I feel anyways :(
FiftyFifty,ffiu0f9,t3_etrzec,1579982694.0,Is there a slow motion bot. Just curious as to what he hit could not tell
ballpython,ffitdch,t3_ettyqm,1579982234.0,That would be perfect if you set it in front of a back drop and took pictures of her in it! Maybe decorate it for every holiday as well as do a different back round. Cute picture here though as well!
RoleReversal,ffisiwx,t3_etqcdu,1579981622.0,Yes but I don't tell him that lol
opiates,ffisgql,t1_ffirpq9,1579981579.0,I hope so too I personally know too many struggling and hate to see posts on here of those struggling it hurts my heart since I know how bad it can be. Wish there were more support services available for everyone. I know some are doinv it alone and that's just not ok.
medical_advice,ffis8u2,t1_ffis5ya,1579981421.0,Btw make sure its an asthma and allergist place. They can check tour lungs and stuff too and see if you're getting a full breath and stuff. As well as see if any treatments may help.
medical_advice,ffis5ya,t1_ffis30c,1579981364.0,Go to a different dr or just tell them you want a referral to be sure. Also go see an allergist as well so you can either prove or disprove that theory
medical_advice,ffis30c,t3_etthkh,1579981305.0,Yeah you need to see a pulmonologist get a referral from your Dr. Any long term issues should be checked out asap. I'm about to go to one for a cough that hasn't gone away as well as to see why I have had to use my rescue inhaler so much more (have slight asthma but guess its getting worse or its from the cough idk)
opiates,ffirl99,t1_ffirhjl,1579980954.0,Well glad everything is going well for you that's awesome man
opiates,ffiqocw,t3_etu2b2,1579980311.0,It's different for everyone but I'm so happy to hear how well you're doing! Don't forget that life has a crappy way of waiting till things are great before pushing you back a few steps. Just be prepared and remember life happens but you just gotta keep pushing. Congrats you're doing awesome!
