Shotguns,ffckucu,t3_ess2og,1579801601.0,"I don't think it much matters to me. I've got shotguns with tang safeties, repeaters with crossbolts, and my only remaining hammer gun, (a muzzleloader), no safety. I just pick up the gun, locate the safety and then just be about my business with no extra thought or worries.

As a leftie, as long as I can flip the safety for left handed use, a rear trigger guard crossbolt is no big deal. I have 2 S/As, an Escort and an SX4 with easily reversible safeties. The Benelli Nova I have is the only repeater safety I've ever come to loathe - it's very stiff and rough to move. Nor is it reversible. And the front mounted safety just feels awkward to me.

Mostly I shoot O/Us and SxS guns. So tang safeties are what I mostly use. They are fast, easy to use, and ambidextrous. They do tend to need a bit more maintenance than crossbolts though. Linkages can get dirty or freeze and even bend or break. Nor are they always an easy fix if there are issues.

I did forget a gun I own. I have a Saiga AK style 12ga. with the AK safety and all it's downfalls. You would think I would hate this safety more than the Benelli Nova - especially being a leftie. But for all it's faults, it's still smoother and easier to operate than the Nova. (For those who might care or not, I did NOT buy the Saiga or the SX4. I sadly inherited them both almost 2 years ago now).

The M/Ler, has but one safety, the one between my ears. Halfcock is NOT a safety. The Mk1 brain safety is the fastest and easiest to use of all and will never mechanically fail. But it can be the most sketchy one, so be wary when totally relying on it. I tend to only hunt with it when alone these days. And yes, there were hammer block safeties on muzzleloader and early breech loaders back in the day. They never got popular because they were awkward and slow to use."
minnesotavikings,ffcg679,t1_ffalm9m,1579798755.0,"I would slightly disagree about Cousins. He can be a pocket passer, but he's probably best as a play action and roll out passer. So linemen who are quick on their feet and athletic are the best choice for this style of offence. They will need to be a bit smaller and faster to consistently function in this style offense.

Bradbury can easily lead a screen or pull out to protect Kirk as he rolls out on play action. The big hulking monsters you guys want are not able to be successful in that kind of offense game after game.

I was born in the later 1950's, and I am the only lefty among my siblings. I remember learning to write as a difficult task in the early 1960's. I drove my older grade school teachers crazy. I could tell they were extremely frustrated that I wouldn't hold my pencil in the proper hand like all the normal kids. I wouldn't crab-claw my hand to keep the paper vertical like you are supposed to. I turned the paper 90 degrees and wrote top to bottom, (I can also turn the paper 180 degrees and write upside down right to left). My letters were never formed correctly. I was always failed for being a lefty. And left behind as unsalvageable. I was told to my face that I could have gotten a better grade if I could write neater on that history paper.

While I'm a big proponent for hunting with antique rifles, (my 1944 Finnish M39 built on an 1893 M91 Mosin-Nagant receiver is a current favorite), if an AR-10 is what you got, have at it - just keep that Hubble telescope you got on it cranked down to the lowest magnification. High magnification and narrow fields of view are a fast way to lose sight of your target in thick cover. The 1100 is also a fine choice and depending on terrain, might be better than the AR.

For firearms seasons, regulations will probably dictate blaze orange so camo will be left at home. Deer are colorblind and don't see well if you are totally still. Their noses are sharper than a katana though. If you don't want cold feet and fingers, keep your head and ears covered and warm. Dress in layers, cotton next to skin, then flannel, then wool. Be wary of sweating and keep your feet dry. Move slow and easy to prevent sweat.

Use de-scenters/cover scents as you will. Just understand that in some areas some cover scents can actually spook deer. For example, coon scent will spook every deer in a 20 mile radius on my farm. But they are fine with fox. Rattle bags and does bleats can work - or not depending on the mood of the deer.

Get a decent knife, but don't spend a ton on it. A dead deer don't care what you spent. I've dressed deer with nothing more than a Victorinox Classic, (it really doesn't take a 14"" Bowie). But I don't recommend the Classic as a rule. I own a good number of fixed blades, most of which I have found sticking in stumps while grouse hunting after deer season, (thanks guys!). My 2 favorite fixed blades are an old #1 Mora laminated and a Grohmann D.H. Russell Bird and Trout. These are a bit smaller and much lighter to carry and are still more than large enough for the job. My favorite all time hunter was a Schrade LB3 lockback.

Finally, know the area you are hunting like the back of your hand - the deer do. Understand when, where, and why they sleep, eat, and move. It takes time and effort to learn these things. But regular success only comes to those who do."

1 tbsp. ginger shreds 

1 tbsp. green onion shreds - white part 1 tbsp. 

light soy sauce 

1 tsp. Chinese cooking wine (white wine ok sub)

Sadly, I inherited a new SX4 last year. I ran about 1500 rounds through it last July and it left me feeling just meh. Dead reliable out of the box.

The Versa Max is a fine waterfowl gun, but it's chunky size and weight makes it less than ideal to me as an upland gun.

If you got the change, I would look at an A400 or the Fabarms LS4, both great upland choices and no slouches in the blinds either.

Shotguns,fd3aeif,t3_ejsxm3,1578156345.0,"Savage is just releasing press on the gun now in advance of the summer shooting season. IMO, at nearly $1500 Savage can keep it. They ain't built any S/A that's worth $1500 yet, (congrats to all the marketing depts that can convince buyers otherwise). From a manufacturing standpoint, repeaters are simple and easy to make. Sell the gun for $500 to maybe $700, (for a well fitted and finished high blued steel and very nice wood version), and maybe you got something. Otherwise, it's just another shell-shucker on a rack overflowing with other wannabes.

At nearly 8lbs dry weight, it's mostly too heavy for upland work, acceptable for waterfowl hunting and perhaps a 1/2lb light for serious target work. The gas system is interesting, but how much recoil reduction comes from the ""new"" gas system versus the extra weight of the gun? I would be interested in finding out just how reliable the gun is with say, 1100 or1150fps 7/8oz target loads. Few 12ga gas guns are totally reliable with such loads and no inertia gun can do it. Is it as good as they claim? If so, it could find a niche with recoil shy/weary target shooters.

When Benelli first hit the market, inertia guns were more reliable as a general rule than the old designs of S/A gas guns. Gas guns could freeze in the sleet and mud of a duck blind. And I saw a good number of them do so when guiding hunts. To be fair, I saw Benelli's freeze up under those conditions also. Just not as many or as often. And a lot of gas gun issues revolve around the higher maintenance needed for those older gas guns.

Today, with the more modern designed gas systems, there is little to really choose from. Gas guns are virtually as reliable as any inertia gun. I have a couple of gassers, an Escort loaner and a new SX4 I inherited. Neither guns needs a rigorous cleaning schedule. I clean the Escort every 1000 rounds or yearly, which ever comes first. The SX4 I ran a tiny bit over 1500 rounds through in one month this past summer. I still haven't felt the need to clean it yet. Maybe when it hits 2000. And other brands of gas operated guns are no different.

Inertia guns haven't been sitting in their butt either. Benelli has refined their action and all the newcomers have also made some improvements too.

All said and done, I still prefer gas gun over inertia guns. Because despite the very slightly increased cleaning needed, gassers are far better at tolerating a wider range of  shotshells. From the very lightest of target loads to the heaviest of turkey loads. And they reduce felt recoil far, far better than any inertia gun.

Choose the gun you like and can afford. There are bunches of good S/A guns to choose from these days."

So yes, I do not like them very much, (I'm not the only one to hold that opinion), nor have they been overly truthful to me, (again others hold the same view).

Benelli does not manufacture their guns to any tighter tolerances than anyone else except perhaps the cheaper guns like the Stoeger. Franchi certainly does every it  bit as well. To do so drives costs far beyond what is needed. It's the 80/20 rule of manufacturing. The last 20% better costs 80% of the price. They are not stupid - a manufacturer never makes anything to tighter tolerances than is needed for correct function. All you get is a little more polish and perhaps a better shot at getting nicer wood.

And to say the latest Benelli action is better, is like saying my SX4 is superior to a SX3. It is most definitely not. (personally, I think it's a step backwards). It is just different enough to protect patents and make the marketing guys happy - not to improve the design. No matter what marketing will tell you.

I'm sorry I did not save those 90's trade magazines for you as a source. But my sources are no better or worse than your one phone call.

There are some Turkish break-actions that are every bit the equal to a Citori or Cynergy, (look at AKUS made guns and the TriStar TT-15 comp guns are starting to get noticed), and I own a AKUS made SxS that is as good as anything the Spanish ever produced and far superior the the Browning BSS. So that idea doesn't hold much water. Again, it's about knowing what to look for and where to look for it.

But you wish to enjoy your Benelli, go right ahead."
Shotguns,fc34gsb,t1_fc2php6,1577381203.0,"Benelli has many faults as a company, but telling the truth ain't necessarily one of them.

Just who do you think kick started the Turkish shotgun industry? Beretta provided a lot of seed money for the Turks to get started with CNC manufacturing back in the 1990's. It was common knowledge in machining trade rags - complete with photos of machines and installations with big smiles and handshakes all around. The Turks have been providing Beretta, Benelli, and Franchi  with small items like screws, springs, firing pins, and stock furniture for a couple decades now, (along with a host of other big names today). And if you know who to talk to in the industry, even some few tubes for Beretta guns now. Though I've not heard about Benelli yet.

The Franchi is indeed a part for part copy of the previous Benelli action, (3rd gen or 4th gen?). Not surprising since all Beretta had to do was run the prints across the street, so to speak. Why would they reinvent the wheel? Even the Stoeger inertia guns are direct knockoffs of the first generation Benellis. Beretta was going to sue that Turkish company out of existence, but decided that the copies were good enough to tell them that they are now working for Beretta instead and still sells them under the Stoeger label today. With those three labels,Stoeger, Franchi, and Benelli - Beretta covers every price point from lowest to highest with literally the same exact basic design. It's pure marketing genius.

Personally, I think that unless Benelli finds something else that is new and innovative, the name will likely fade considerably over the next 10 to 20 years. And the 825U O/U ain't the new idea they need either.

If you like your Benelli and are OK with spending the coin for one, fine by me. Just understand you ain't getting anything necessarily extra besides the name, (and crappy customer service), that you can't get elsewhere for less if you know where to look."

And the wood versions of the Element are often stocked with better looking wood, being much closer to the source of nice Turkish Walnut.

And how many rusted V3's have you seen? No one I know that owns one has complained about such issues. Nor have I read of anyone making such claims."
Shotguns,fc1p4pc,t1_fc1hv7z,1577325283.0,"The Franchi and Weatherby Element are direct copies of the Benelli action, (unsurprisingly since Beretta owns Franchi). And there are no patents on the Bruno Civolani design remaining. So anyone can make them these days. And everyone does make them.

Edit to add: The Remington V3 has nothing to do with the junk 870 Express that deserves so much hate. The V3 is scoring high marks from gun writers and owners alike."
