Sure, but there are only so many places we can put those things. The UK for example doesn't have any viable sites for pumped hydro storage. Even if there were a site flooding large areas isn't great for the environment either.

Replacing multiple large consoles dedicated to specific tasks with a single hardware solution, reduces the amount of spares required to be carried onboard and will significantly decrease through-life costs.

Shared Infrastructure is the new hardware approach, sounds like a blade centre with thin client consoles. A completely different thing to the OS which is almost certainly linux for the important bits.
