Meanwhile, get quotes from local dealerships, particularly BMW, as they will buy your car without you having to buy a car. Take your car to CarMax, get an appraisal from TrueCar and KBB, and have the offer in hand. Depending on how long you are willing to put up with private party, where ultimately you will get more money for the car, you'll have the trade in offers in hand and can go right in. The other good news is essentially the longer you wait to actually sell the vehicle, the more principal you'll be paying down as the payoff amount from your lender will literally decrease by the day. If it takes you a month to sell from today, then you owe one less car payment on the car. Keep it up and you'll eventually pay the entire thing off!

RandomKindness,feny047,t3_eg22t2,1579292525.0,"I got a thinker for you. Read on for a depiction as to how many different combinations there are to shuffle a deck of playing cards into:

""Imagine you shuffle a deck of cards once per second, every second. You shuffle 86400 times per day.

You start on the equator, facing due east. Every 24 hours (86400 shuffles), you take one step (one metre) forward. You keep shuffling, second after second, each day moving one more metre. After about 110 thousand years, you will have walked in a complete circle around the Earth (I know: you can't walk on water. Just ignore that part).

When you have completed one walk around the Earth, take one cup (250mL) of water out of the Pacific Ocean. Then, start all over again, shuffling, once per second, every second, taking a step every 24 hours. When you get around the Earth a second time (another 110000 years), take another cup of water out of the Pacific Ocean.

Eventually (after approximately 313 quadrillion years, or so, about 22 billion times longer than the age of the universe), the Pacific Ocean will be dry. At that point, fill up the Pacific Ocean with water all over again, and place down one sheet of paper. Then, begin the process all over again, second by second, every 24 hours walking another metre, every lap around the Earth another cup of water, every time the Pacific Ocean runs dry, refilling it and then laying down another sheet of paper.

Eventually, your stack of sheets of papers will be tall enough to reach the Moon. I think it goes without saying that, at this point, the numbers become very difficult to comprehend, but it would take a very very very very very long time to do this enough to get a stack of paper high enough to reach the Moon. Once you get a stack of papers high enough to reach the moon, throw it all away and begin the whole process again, shuffle by shuffle, metre by metre, cup of water by cup of water, sheet of paper by sheet of paper.

Once you have successfully reached the Moon one billion times, congratulations! You are now 0.00000000000001% of the way to shuffling 8 * 1067 times!"" -u/WSp71oTXWCZZ0ZI6"

askcarsales,fenhkbr,t3_epytqv,1579284838.0,"Hey I had a similar situation - sold a financed BMW with a decent amount still remaining on the loan, though not upside down and ended up purchasing an older car with 0 payments. I ran into a situation with a 2009 M3 with 100k miles on it whereas I needed to sell due to personal circumstances. Value at the time was ~18k for trade-in and ~23k on the private market and I owed approximately 16k. 

Anyhow, what you do is list it for sale and get a bunch of quotes for trade-in. Trade-in will always be less valuable but less of your time will be wasted. The purpose of doing both is to see if you can get more money (effectively meaning you'll end up owing less once sold) on the private party market. After a few failed negotiations on the private market to try and muster 22k, I fell short on time and had a quote in hand for a trade-in, and sold it for 19k the very next day. I used a service that came to you and towed it off.

Next step was we met at a bank where they withdrew cash for the negotiated amount of 19k then went straight to my bank. At this point, they had provided all paperwork which was already signed off on. We went right across the street to my bank/lender, paid off the remaining capital on the loan with the cash I was just given, and deposited the net difference of 3k into my bank account. The service let me drive my car back home so I wouldn't need to call a ride, put it on a flatbed, and towed her away - all was said and done and the bank transferred the title over to the service.

In your situation, I'd imagine you can do a very similar thing, you'll just need to pony up the difference of what you sell it for by the time you get to your bank, otherwise no title will be released. Say you negotiate a trade-in of 20k and the car has 25k remaining - if trading it in you can do exactly what I did except you'll also need to have a $5k check in hand ready to go once you go to pay off the loan to the vehicle. 

Good luck"

2015/16 Audi S5: ~40k-50k miles for ~$25k-$30k - This may do the trick, but as you've said in other comments if BMW/Mercs are the standard nice car, Audi certainly is the luxury definition of bland - they're glorified VW's and less engaging than a BMW and less luxurious than a Merc. 

2017/18 Infiniti Q60 3.0t: ~30k-40k miles for ~$25k - I personally stay away from Infiniti. Nissan/Infiniti are a tier below just about any other luxury brand. 

2015/16 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 3.8: ~20k-30k miles for ~$20k - While I love my Genesis, it's a sedan and a completely different vehicle. I do not like the Coupes and think you can do much better.

*Here's my suggestions*:

BMW 2/3 series (M240, M340) - very fun, very sporty, could be what you're looking for in terms of engagement, also pricier than any of the below. 

Kia Stinger - I mean, if you've already looked at the Hyundai Genesis Coupes, it's worth a look. One can be had for approximately 25k.

BMW 335i (e90) - a 2010 should be a decent year. I had one of these and they're one of the most fun cars I've driven - I did a lot of aftermarket things, but even stock is fun. Just be wary of some known issues (HPFP, wastegate, turbos) - the good news is these then fell under a 10 yr/120k mile warranty for the vehicle, the bad news is we're in 2020 now so you're screwed there. Purchase a solid aftermarket warranty, factor the cost of the vehicle and you'll be well under 25k. 

BMW M3 (e90) - less reliability concerns, though there have been issues regarding the rod bearings. I owned one in addition to the 335i above and had no concerns with the rod bearings. Very fun car that actually seems to be appreciating in value as it was the last M car to be naturally aspirated. Plus it has a 8000+ RPM redline V8. Should be able to find a nice one for around 25k.

Hyundai Genesis Sedan 5.0 ('15-'16) - not a sport car by any means - as noted earlier, the sedan and coupe are a world apart. The sedan is a gorgeous luxury cruiser with plenty of amenities, but you'll able to get the job done in the 5.0 (standard is a 3.8L) when getting on freeways, overtaking, and spreading out on an open road. You can probably get one for 25k

I guess I'm kind of a BMW guy after reading through my suggestions. What's funny is new BMW's have essentially turned me off to the brand so I'm not really a brand loyalist, but they made very fun cars in the 2000's. The exception for my preference in newer bimmers are the new 2 series, they're great."
