fatlogic,ffi021g,t3_etgmzb,1579960895.0,This is why I never eat at Hardee’s anymore. A chicken sandwich or burger there (even no cheese) is my entire day and then some. I actually do like knowing calories ahead of time so I stand a chance at making up for it later (or ordering the kid’s sizes!!)
fatlogic,ffhzxm6,t1_ffh4w9a,1579960774.0,"Shake Shack is amazing though. Luckily I was doing a shitload of walking on the strip in Vegas that day and had already started WW back up so I prepared for it and looked it up before I ate. It wasn’t filling in the least, and the only way to be even close to OK in calories is eating the smallest sizes, and half or less of the burger/fries/soda. It was worth it for the experience but it didn’t fill me up or anything. Had I eaten like a normal person without checking first, my entire day’s maintenance would have been gone."
fatlogic,fedh1tq,t3_ej6o9x,1579011315.0,"We had something like this at weight watchers. It was a no weigh in skip the scale pass. And some people just don’t want to know because they panic. Sometimes we need to put on our big people undies and get over it,  but yeah, people do this."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fdayxh3,t1_fdaxfk5,1578251958.0,They divorced after less than a year- and three months after that his “relationship coach” was pregnant with his twins...not sure it counts as working on it when you hook up with the person advising you.
MarriedAtFirstSight,fdawrep,t1_fdawho2,1578251277.0,He was one of the worst- but Luke and Matt eclipsed him and we forgot. He hooked up with the lady who was helping them with their marriage “issues” and they had twins right away. It was awful for Sonia. She’s really sweet on Twitter.
WeightLossAdvice,fdam1j5,t3_ek2lft,1578247539.0,"Awesome! Went back to WW after staying stagnant with post baby weight around 2 months ago. Lost 15 lbs, still eat reasonably and get my cardio on. Nothing crazy though. Nice work. For me, exercise helps me maintain or lose a little- but I can out eat any excess cardio/squats etc if I don’t try with my diet. As soon as I watched my food, and chilled on mindless eating and excess exercise, the weight started to fall off. Some weeks better than others of course. Congratulations!"
My600lbLife,fdakjmu,t1_fd76wiu,1578247065.0,"I wonder if this depends on the Doctor, hospital or type of surgery. After my csections (difference is DR and hospitals) but sometimes I was allowed to eat real food just hours after. I think twice is was clear broth etc. But no food before of course. Which sucked during my first labor. Ex got fast food during the 21 hours after my water broke and I only got a few ice chips in case I needed a CS (which I did.) It sucked but the pain kind of trumped the hunger in labor."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fdaj9o6,t3_ekelv8,1578246676.0,I feel like the worst dudes on the show had secret sex with the women and lied about it or made them hide it. Luke and Nick from Sonia’s season come to mind. The manufactured drama and poor editing make me less interested in this show now.
MarriedAtFirstSight,fdaix8x,t3_ekelv8,1578246560.0,Yeah he sucked.
MarriedAtFirstSight,fcykysd,t3_ejigwq,1578081911.0,I followed him on Twitter for a while. He blocks people for no good reason and has a terrible attitude. I understood a little better after that...
HydroHomies,fbznnfo,t3_ef0lj0,1577253043.0,Watermelon is pretty awesome...
