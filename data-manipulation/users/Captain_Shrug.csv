""Soldier,"" 1998. A group of soldiers trained from childhood to be perfect warriors are replaced by gene-grown ""superior"" models. Their leader, played by Kurt Russel, then turns and wages a guerilla war against the gene-hanced types when they attack the people who have given him shelter; essentially proving that skill and experience beat the shit out of just being strong and fast.

There's a *wonderful* scene: 



Sandra : How do you know they'll be back?

Todd : Because they're soldiers, Sir. Like me.

Sandra : Why are they doing this?

Todd : They're obeying orders, Sir. It's their duty.

Sandra : Do you know how many there will be?

Todd : Seventeen more, Sir.

Sandra : Oh my God, you can't fight seventeen more on your own! You have to organize us! We're not cowards, we'll do as you tell us, we'll fight!

Todd : No.

Sandra : Why not?

Todd : Soldiers deserve *soldiers,* Sir.

Sandra : But one soldier, against seventeen. What are you going to do?

Todd : *I'm going to kill them all, Sir.*

TELL ME you can't see that conversation happening in 40k.


[edit] OR THIS ONE!



Sandra : Sgt. Todd... what's it like? What's it like being a soldier? What do you think about?

[silence] 

Sandra : You must think about something?

[silence] 

Sandra : What about feelings then?

40kLore,fgjbnkr,t1_fgirpmd,1580840717.0,"One that gets me is they're effectively immune to so many of the threats of the universe. (genestealers can't get at them because of their strange caste system, chaos hasn't been a threat because of the whole ""weak souls"" thing.) Them being so tiny means the authors can't have them really suffer losses to those, so they've been sorta benched until this kind of development. 

The other empires are all varying shades of black running to charcoal grey (The Eldar are a dying race trying to fend off extinction by desperate and often genocidally underhanded methods, the dark Eldar literally use the suffering of others as sustenance, the Imperium is a crumbling juggernaut that until recently was really only still moving forward by sheer damn momentum, the orks want to fight *everything* and are terrifying under their self image of football hooligans, the Necrons are the Terminator out to wipe out all life, the Nids are out to *eat* all life, and Chaos is *literally hell.*) but until recently the Tau were nice, progressive, kind, and with just a hint of mind control to ""grease the wheels"" so to speak. If the mind control were cranked up so that there's a lot more ""Brave New World"" feel, I'd say go for it, that's perfect for me. 

Part of what I like (even though I know that it makes me sound like an edgelord to say it) is that in 40k, factions survive ""in spite of."" The Eldar survive in spite of a pissed off deity that wants to eat them. The Imperium survives in spite of being food and/or targets for everything in the galaxy, even themselves. The orks survive in spite of eternal war with everything. The Nids survive in spite of the attempts by every other race to shove them off. The Necron survive in spite of being involved in Galactic War I basically, and then being buried for untold eons. Each of those has heavily marked the factions. But the Tau just *are.*
