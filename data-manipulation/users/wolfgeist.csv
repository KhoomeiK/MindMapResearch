hotas,ffywk5r,t1_ffyvhqf,1580356942.0,"I recently got into hotas and such, for the longest time I was looking at the saitek x-56 because a long time ago I read that it was the best. And it also looked nice. Thankfully because of this very specialized, very specific community, I was able to do research and see all the differences between the products and so forth. 

If it was my job to research this kind of stuff, I think I would do well because I happen to be really interested in it, but I think it's reasonable to assume that most people would not be like that. The flight Sim community is a very niche group of people. And beyond that part of the community that looks for the best hardware is a much smaller niche. I can imagine that if you didn't know where to begin that it could be a long journey to fully understand all of this stuff. That alone is it job that you would have to hire for and hope that the applicant would perform well at. That's potentially a large cost in itself."

hotas,ffyv0a2,t1_ffyu4ze,1580355826.0,"It all comes down to a cost benefit analysis. The question is, if many people are using this over the course of a day and the joystick receives extra wear and tear, would stainless steel gimbals that last longer be cheaper in the long run or would it be more cost-effective to just replace the warthog? That alone would probably require some testing and cost, it's probably easier to just go with the most cost-effective solution which the warthog is known for being.

With that said there are are seemingly many reports of the warthog wearing out just from gaming use. The VKB and virpil sticks do cost more, but not by an order of magnitude by any means. My impression is that they would be worth the extra cost, but as you said there's already a licensing agreement with thrustmaster and that alone might constitute a significant cost difference due to licensing fees, hard to say."

I got a VKB stick with an extra grip for $400 slightly used 2nd hand. That wouldn't even cover the cost of a single tool needed to fabricate some of the parts, not including time/labor."

hotas,ffythv1,t1_ffwcql2,1580354739.0,"Crazy thing is its probably much more difficult and complex to make a realistic simulation software than to construct this thing. 

With machinery, with enough money you can do whatever you want as long as it fits within the confines of physics. Software engineering is different, because to do something new you have to forge new paths which makes it orders of magnitude more complex.

With that said, not sure why they didn't just go with DCS or something taht already exists. Probably licensing issues, but then again I believe our military has a contract with [Bohemia Interactive Simulations for the VBS series of combat simulations.](https://www.youtube.com/user/bisimmedia)"

You could argue that on the contrary, it's why the game exists at all. 

Ideally, CIG would fund the game themselves out of their own pockets. Or Elon Musk would pay for the game. In reality, a game like this is going to need a very unique financial solution to even exist, period. 

Also when the game is ""launched"", there's going to be plenty of people with huge fleets that need a bunch of bodies to operate them. You can theoretically go into that game without a ship at all and have as much fun as anyone else.

Edit: also, if the game is going to be an open world game with freedom and player driven economy, there will be a lot of loose ends i.e. I don't think money or items will be account bound upon looting and should be freely tradable, stealable, etc. This means that at some level, the in game economy will interface with the real world economy, in which case it's actually BETTER for people to give CIG money rather than a corporation in China with a warehouse full of miners so that money can go back to development.  Either way you can't have a truly open world and player economy without being p2w on some level."

hotas,ffsmqs1,t3_ev0dhi,1580185661.0,"I also had an idea in mind for an extendable mouse platform that would rotate 180 degrees vertically to make room for my left hand joystick - basically the mouse platform would be something like 1/3rd of my keyboard tray on the right side, and would collapse underneath my desk but could extend towards me to make room on the left for a joystick mount via HOMAS or joystick in left hand + mouse on the right, while being collapsible to not take up desktop space when the joystick was not in use.

Another issue I have is that of a sliding keyboard tray. What would you use for hardware if you wanted to implement a sliding keyboard tray?

Ultimately the framing is not a question, but i'm looking for interesting hardware solutions to solve these modular desk problems."

earrumblersassemble,ffsk43h,t3_cy094p,1580183672.0,"I can move my ears back without rumbling. But generally moving the ears back is associated with rumbling (which is in turn associated with sleep paralysis for me).

I can create the rumbling without moving my ears at all, but by flexing some kind of internal muscle that seems to be somewhere between my cheek bones, ears, and under my eyes. To intensify the rumbling I generally squint my lower eyelids and move my ears back and up, along with flexing the ambiguous muscle that's somewhere behind my upper jawline."
Sleepparalysis,ffsjt43,t3_eafivm,1580183451.0,"The ""radio static"" that you describe is exactly what I get, that immediately informs me that i'm about to go through SP.

Check out this sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/earrumblersassemble/

I can ""rumble"" my ears on command. But during SP, it happens involuntarily, obviously.

Worst part about SP for me is I feel like I stop breathing. So, generally my strategy is to just focus on breathing and relax, eventually I come out of it. Relaxing is not always easy, as sometimes when the ""rumbling"" begins I feel like I begin falling or am being dragged at a rate of like 100 ft. per second. But relaxing helps with that, I know i'm along for the ride and that i'll be fine if I wait it out.

I only get SP if I sleep on my right side, so immediately when I wake up I switch to my left side.

BTW found this post from your cybernetic fingers post, just thought i'd let you know. *shrug*"
