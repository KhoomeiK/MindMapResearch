stopdrinking,ff9zh4o,t3_esegmy,1579724809.0,"God I am so sorry for your loss.  It reminded me of how I lost my dad, almost 10 years ago to this day.  I am literally typing this through tears recalling what happened and how I still blame myself in some ways for not doing more.

My dad lived on the other side of the country and I didn't talk to him a lot in his last years because his alcoholism was so severe, and being in recovery myself for such a short time it was just so really hard to talk to him.  The cops knew he was in rough shape and would do wellness checks on him every few days just because they knew what a mess he was.

On the last check, they found him unresponsive and rushed him to the hospital.  He got there in time and they were able to save him at that time.  My aunt even visited him the next day and said he looked like he was doing better while he was detoxing, under the hospital's care.  He was sitting up in bed, was eating, and they had him on meds to keep the DTs at bay.

Then early the next morning he aspirated and choked to death.  February 7, 2010, around 3:00 AM.  They tried to put in a breathing tube but couldn't do it in time.  I found out about it from a cousin of mine thru a message on Facebook.  I called my mom (my folks had been divorced for 30+ years) and she told me she had heard about it earlier that morning, but didn't want to tell me while I was at work.  

One of my uncles eventually drove down to his house and went through it.  It was literally a pigsty.  He had stray cats living in it, holes in some of the doors, windows missing.  The plumbing was not working due to neglect.  His truck in his driveway had the battery stolen out of it.  It was a f\*cking mess.  My uncle took pictures of the place but it was difficult to even look at those.

My dad was the second of his siblings to be taken by alcoholism.  One of my uncles had passed away ten years before that.  It runs in my family, as I have several cousins who also struggle with substance abuse.  I've already lost a few of them, too.

This is such a terrible way to lose a parent.  I honestly feel for you and have a good idea of what you're going through.  Take care of yourself and be well.

I did my first go-round of IOP a year after my first hospitalization.  I was also in my mid-30s and was also struggling with substance abuse issues in addition to bipolar.  It was a three-week program and it really helped me out at the time, despite the fact that I was misdiagnosed with major depression and not bipolar.  

Regardless of your official diagnosis, you will learn some things about how to deal with your condition and hopefully get some good tools for going through life.  I still use the tools I got from my IOPs to this day, 12+ years later.

I have always been ""different"" and ""not normal"" in many aspects-- much to the chagrin of my long-suffering mother, who raised me as a single parent and had to put up with my staying in my bedroom for weeks on end because I didn't want to deal with anything, or obsessing over a hobby 24/7 at the expense of everything else in my life.

bipolar2,fehtc2a,t3_ep2x17,1579123463.0," Do not take St. John's wort with ~~quetiapine (seroquel)~~  ANY SSRI or SNRI.  Period.

I tried taking it once, 20-odd years ago, while I was also taking a fairly high dose of Paxil.  I broke out in a head-to-toe rash and ended up at the Emergency Room.  

St. John's wort can be effective in treating depression, but it can also be very dangerous when mixed with other medications, especially anti-depressants.  Make sure you check with a health professional before you mix up any kid of medical treatments, even herbal supplements, because you never know how they will react together.

I hope you are feeling better today because those interactions can be very scary, especially if you don't know what is causing them."
politics,fehbsca,t1_feh4jzd,1579113311.0,"Not to justify the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but the reasons behind the liberation of Kuwait were a bit more complicated.  [Iraq claimed Kuwait was ""slant drilling"" into the Rumaila oil field to get oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Kuwait#Alleged_economic_warfare_and_slant_drilling), essentially violating Iraq's borders and sovereignty-- and also overproducing crude and driving down the price, which had a large impact on Iraq's largely oil-based economy.

Also, the whole Iraq/Kuwait conflict goes all the way back to the the [Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Ottoman_Convention_of_1913) in which the UK essentially carved a piece off of Mesopotamia and created Kuwait.  Yes, ancient history, but still a sore point for many Iraqis.

Additionally, the Kuwaitis financed a large part of Iraq's role in the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, and the Iraqis were on the hook for paying this money back.

So, essentially, Kuwait had backed Saddam Hussein and Iraq into a corner, and the country was desperate to get out of it.  The Iraqis also perceived the Emir of Kuwait to be very unpopular among the Kuwaiti populace, of which only 1/3 were ""citizens"", the rest being guest workers with restricted rights in the emirate.  Thus, Saddam claimed that he was ""liberating"" Kuwait from its rulers and giving more freedom to its inhabitants (i.e., the non-citizens, who tended to be working/lower-class servants for the rich).

Like I said, it doesn't justify Iraq's invasion of Kuwait one bit-- it is never right to invade another country.  However, Kuwait was hardly blameless in this fiasco, and the intervention of the US and subsequent stationing of US troops in Saudi Arabia long-term didn't help things out, either.

In fact, the continued presence of US troops in the Muslim Holy Land (Saudi Arabia) pissed off a lot of radical Islamists-- like, Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda, for example-- as they were furious that infidels (non-Muslims) had a prolonged military presence there.  It was one of the justifications they used for their so-called ""jihad"" against the west, the US in particular.  And it indirectly led to the bombing of the World Trade Center (TWICE) and the bombing of the USS Cole.

So sure, GHWB could have ""finished"" it all by toppling Saddam Hussein, but chances are you would have still ended up with a gigantic shitshow/quagmire in the middle east, regardless.

Looking back, I can see that a lot of my mixed episodes were due to coming out of a depression due to being misdiagnosed with major depression.  I wasn't on a mood stabilizer (just an anti-d) so I'd go flying out of depression and into hypomania.  

Eventually the anti-d would ""crap out"" (actual words from an ex-psychiatrist of mine) and he would add on a small dose of lithium, and things would smooth out.   After a hospitalization at a mood disorder clinic one of the docs finally figured it out, after he had me graph my moods over the course of 10 years, with the medications I took, along with the dosages.   Turns out things were a lot smoother when I was taking the lithium in addition to the anti-d, regardless of what anti-d I was taking (by this time, I'd taken almost every SSRI under the sun that was available at the time).

Alex was still running his guitars thru amps and into speakers, which is why you can still see amplifier speakers.

Since it looked kind of odd without anything behind Geddy, he had some fake chicken roasters put in.  They didn't really serve any purpose other than to fill in some space in back but it was pretty humorous as well.  

Shortly after this, Alex began doing something similar with his guitars and got rid of his speakers on the back line, so he put tumble dryers behind him.  It was definitely one of the more clever-looking back lines in rock."

I was misdiagnosed with major depression and consequently took anti-depressants without any kind of mood stabilizer, which led to (as you can guess) manic episodes triggered by the antidepressants when not used with a mood stabilizer.

Eventually I was finally classified as ""Bipolar NOS (not otherwise specified)"".  I was finally diagnosed after my third hospitalization (the last time was the second time within two months).  This sounds like it's very similar to what you're experiencing, in that ""the real you"" is probably when you've been hypomanic but not even realizing it.

I was told that the BP2 diagnosis usually doesn't mean you are manic/severe enough to be hospitalized so that's why I don't think I'm BP2.  And my ""manias"" don't seem very severe compared to most peoples.  I'll go on a spending spree and charge $1000 on a credit card, as opposed to buying a car or two like others do.

In my therapy group, when we introduce ourselves and describe our diagnoses, I usually claim I am ""Bipolar 1.5""-- somewhere between bipolar 1 and bipolar 2 but not really either one.

worldpolitics,fcl7fxi,t3_ehfbsw,1577741444.0,"Is the author implying that those of us raised by single parents are going to be criminals, dropouts, or worse?

My absentee father left my mom when I was 4.  He moved across the country and I saw him every couple years after that.  He had mental issues and was also an alcoholic.  If my parents would have stayed together I probably would have turned into one, too.  His alcoholism eventually killed him, just like it did to his father and one of his brothers.

I had one parent:  my mother.  She raised me up properly.  I got good grades in school, went to a good university, never got into any trouble outside of a few traffic tickets.  Today, I have a good job, I own my house, I pay my taxes on time, and support my spouse and step kids, too.  I'd hardly call that being a criminal or a bad example.

If the father is a bad person, it's probably **better** that the child is raised by a single, loving, responsible parent."
politics,fcknvkq,t1_fck2po7,1577729390.0,"TBF most of the ""real"" work in Congress gets done in the committees, where legislation is drafted, and then forwarded on to the full house for votes.  That's not to say voting isn't important-- according to the Constitution it's the main reason they are there (committees are not mentioned in the Constitution at all).  But, if you are truly interested in serving your constituents, you attend all the committee meetings you can, as that's where the bills get drafted-- and the $$$ gets allocated."

bipolar2,fc6hucv,t3_egdjv4,1577480928.0,"First and foremost you need to get a diagnosis.  Self-diagnosis is a good place to start, but chances are you are not a mental health professional.   Not to mention BP2 is very hard to diagnose and it can easily be confused with other conditions, like chronic depression.  Start with a good general practitioner and get a referral for a mental health specialist from there.

I've done group therapy off and on for the past couple decades, and it has even been more helpful than one-on-one counselling on some occasions.  Even though I'm not very social I found that being in a group with other people in a similar situation was very helpful.  

Best of luck to you and I hope you can find some relief."

I've never had a random drug test and IIRC there's something in the union contract that forbids it, unless there's good cause (like you come into work obviously high or f'd up on something).  It's not the most glamorous job, but OTOH it is one of the few stable things in my life I can count on."

We've got a couple of bullet holes in one of our buildings due to some guy who got pissed off that the government was garnishing his wages to pay back child support he owed.  So yeah, it might be safe compared to some professions, but depending on who you work with it can be very dangerous."
