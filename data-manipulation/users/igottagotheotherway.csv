orangetheory,fgo4935,t1_fgmbkjf,1580959417.0,US1 or 17th Street? I just tried a new studio for the first time and it was nice. I’m interested in trying others and Ft Laud isn’t far from my office! Also if you don’t want to answer this I totally understand lol

orangetheory,fghiu0m,t3_eyfgbs,1580785791.0,"Ugh. I rollerbladed 11 miles yesterday and probably with bad form because I wasn’t paying attention, and my back is hurting today. I went to class still and basically told the coach I would take it easy, but them goblet squats didn’t feel great. Rest today tomorrow is much needed. Maybe I shoulda late canceled :("

orangetheory,fgg3rfv,t1_fgfhm27,1580753613.0,Oh god I rollerbladed almost 11 miles yesterday. Today is looking rough for me.
orangetheory,fgg3m7t,t1_fgflnqa,1580753525.0,I think class time also makes a difference. The first time I took a 9AM Saturday class I was shocked. My 11AM Sunday is super chill and only a 2G. This 9AM 3G was FULL OF ENERGY. I was taken aback. It ended up being a fun new experience but...I’m a Sunday 11AM kind of gal lol.
