I would recommend you take time off work to mourn as I wouldn't be able to do that, My dog died on new years so I had a few days to mourn in the rest of the holidays. It really didn't help someone made fun of the situation on the first day back but this isn't about that? Once again I am truly sorry for your loss and remember that no one has truly died till they're forgotten."

The physics of that game just make the driving fun as hell (That's why I prefer bikes over cars) and if you happen to play it then if you play from today to the 5th you'll get a free million and then the 6th to the 12th you can get another."
Piracy,ffy9y4l,t3_eveft0,1580341463.0,I'm in my early teens and have been pirating shit since I first got my hands on computer and wanted something (Minecraft) and that's what broke that computer. In the beginning I knew Jack about how to properly pirate but in recent years with Reddit it has been great as this sub is a great resource (although I have heard of tbp beforehand) and got me a free VPN subscription which I use often. Thanks everyone for everything and thank you for reading this.
