So yeah, it's really up to your career aspirations, because I'm pretty sure both phys and bio need considerable amount of effort to do well. If you really don't know what you're going to do, then take physics coz it opens up more paths.

I'm also J2 but if you are weak at J1 topics, my take would be to focus on J2 topics first so it doesn't pile up. Once syllabus has all been taught/June hols then go back to weaker topics."

WatchRedditDie,feypa87,t1_feyo51k,1579448577.0,"id argue they arent hating against christians individually. they are hating against the church and its leaders, who abuse their power and manipulate their own people. sure theres people who complain about christians there, but its probably about their own family treating them like shit for not being accepting of their atheism. how is it cherry picking at all? the fact that there are already numerous such cases that were kept hidden is deeply alarming."
