slowcooking,ffi2eb8,t1_ffgkwhn,1579963073.0,"I tried that once and it was a disaster. I say this light-heartedly. I was making my Crock-Pot meal before work, and I was like oh I'll just take an extra five minutes to brown it first. No big deal. So I'm completely dressed and ready to walk out the door and I start to brown the meat and get the other stuff ready. The meat is on the stove and it's sizzling and popping everywhere! All over the stove. I'm trying not to get it on my arms and clothes. I finally say fuck that and just put it in the Crock-Pot. But I didn't want to leave my stove greasy all day, so then I had to take extra time to clean it even though I needed to leave for work. So I vowed to never do that again."
