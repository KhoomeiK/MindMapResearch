nottheonion,fdnuque,t1_fdntwpz,1578593240.0,"Cheers my friend. I love that typical American way of life, although I am not. I agree completely with everything you have said, 100%. I also agree that toxic masculinity is a very real thing, probably even more so outside of your fair country. I'm from Egypt and let me tell you, it is 10,000% real here, and I also have been a victim of it at many points in my life, so imagine what a woman would probably have faced. I also agree that the approach for this convention is quite repulsive for me and I doubt that it would do much benefit but I was triggered due to the dismissal of it just because they are dudes while we have been patiently and compassionately listening to women about masculinity for decades, not due to the points raised. To be honest I think toxic femininity is also getting more real as we speak and sometimes there is a huge double standard when it comes to raising these issues. Anyhow, I respect where you are coming from and totally understand. Cheers and greetings from an Egyptian dude."

These dudes here think that the current trends of femininity are destructive and thus they are also victims of it. So why discredit them just because they are dudes?"

I was merely pointing out that just because the opposite gender has an opinion about how the other gender affects them is not enough to discredit them. The points are what is to be looked at. OP was merely stating that those are a bunch of dudes and so their opinion on femininity is irrelevant. At least that's what I understood. I'm glad it's working for you mate to listen to them about masculinity I'm not against that at all, and btw I'm married."
