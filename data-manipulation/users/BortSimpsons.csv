My wife had cold showers as a kid because she grew up in China where having a hot shower is seen as a sort luxury so she sort of resented having them. (this was 25 years ago and hot showers are pretty much normal in China now)"

I've been hit with 120 VAC several times. Some people just NEVER learn the lesson. I've shocked across finger to finger (one hand) (hurts), Palm to elbow - (really hurts), and yes, from hand to hand a couple times - directly through the chest. I'm lucky it didn't stop my heart. But don't try this at home - or anywhere else for that fact.

When working on aircraft I managed to accidentally touch the live terminal of a switch with my right hand while my left hand was locked onto another grounded metal surface. THAT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE DEADLY. Fortunately it just simply knocked me on my butt. It would seem that momentary contact is somewhat less dangerous - I still say don't try this at home or anywhere else - it would seem that the more dangerous situation is if you're using a power tool, one with a hand grip, and with the other hand you grab a grounded metal pole. Your muscles will contract, tightening your grip on the tool and on the pole. It's the not letting go part that is the worst. Even still, the briefest contact with current flowing across the heart muscle CAN end your life for good.

Someone said to me ""You must have high internal resistance."" Then someone else said ""Yeah, chit don't conduct."" Maybe being full of chit has saved my foolish life on a number of occasions. Still, 6 milliamps has been proven to be able to end your life.

Wanna try a real world experiment? Get a sheet of aluminum foil and lay it on a table. Lay your left arm on the sheet and take another strip of aluminum and make an arm band out of it. Grab an old transformer (smaller would be less uncomfortable) then take the primary and connect one wire to the sheet on the table and the other to your arm band. Then take the secondary and connect it to a D cell battery. Give it a brief moment to charge the magnetic core then disconnect the battery. The resulting shock will suddenly contract your arm muscle causing your arm to jump off the sheet.

Now: Consider that your heart is just a muscle. So is your arm. If an electrical impulse can lift your arm off the table imagine what 120 VAC can do to your heart muscle. And it doesn't take much current. As little as 6 milliamps CAN kill you. This is not something you want coursing through your chest. But the left arm thing will demonstrate a very powerful jolt just from a 1.5 volt D Cell battery. And that's merely 1.5 volts.

OK, the resulting voltage from the transformer - depending on the size WILL amplify the jolt quite a bit. Maybe 40 to 80 volts. You'll learn something from the aluminum experiment. But if you try with the 120 VAC - could very well be the last experiment you ever perform. Unless you believe in god and hope he'll resurrect your dumb butt."
