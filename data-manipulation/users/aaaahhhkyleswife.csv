After researching a bunch, I have found a robo-advisor and created an account. NOW. I'm assuming I will be able to transfer my earnings to my Roth....Since the money came out of a Roth IRA, do I need to pay taxes on the earnings? I am so confused as to how this works now... Sorry if this is beginner stuff. Please let me know if there is a better subreddit for this. Thanks!"
SuicideWatch,fdb4mu1,t1_fdavlhh,1578253751.0,"But will he though? It may look like that on the outside, but he'll treat her the same way he treated you. I really don't believe people change that much. Unless he has a total life transformation, if he has no conscience to respect you as a human being, he will continue to show this lack of respect throughout his life no matter who he's with. And you will continue to be the wonderful person you are!

I guarantee most every other person would have dumped him the first time. You are so loving and show so much forgiveness and tenacity for wanting to still make it work. If anything it goes to show how wonderful you are and how shitty he is. It sucks when your heart gets wrapped up in it though. But you're a wonderful person it sounds like! Just got involved with the wrong person! Don't let the way he treated you be the standard you accept! If  a partner is not willing to reciprocate the love you give, you don't deserve them. No one deserves that!"

SuicideWatch,fd771gk,t1_fd5isvu,1578200265.0,You're not a terrible person. At all. You were taken advantage of by a terrible person. This is not your fault love. You bent over backwards and in the end he didn't even care to reciprocate. Which doesn't mean you're the problem. He was. It sucks now. For sure. Breaking up made my heart feel like it was getting stabbed. But you deserve so much better friend. I always found that power jams help in the moment sometimes (ex I will survive - Gloria Gaynor) I'm here to listen if you need to vent more.

I think it came with finding something to distract me. School maybe? All I can say is I know how hard it is. I'm rooting for you. I know it feels hopeless now. And you don't know when it will get better. I used to think that every time I failed, that was it. I was a failure. I've learned that's not the case. Every time you fail, that's it. You failed. Just try better tomorrow. Hopefully you'll notice your body image improving over time. I know that's shitty advice. But I hope it helps. It comes from within though. No amount of therapy or anything can fix it. I hope you keep at it my friend!"

Mother's should always be there for their children first, especially when they're being subjected to abuse. It sounds like she's lost her way. Unfortunately, parents are just grown up kids too and sometimes aren't the adult figures we need them to be. I'm sorry you're having to experience this. Your feelings are your feelings.

Oxygen saturation is just one of the ways to measure the oxygen that's floating around on your red blood cells. I'm not sure the magic that happens with the red light, but I'm sure there's a YouTube video somewhere about it. it's very typical when you're sleeping and you have some lung issues going on, that your oxygen saturation may drop because you're not breathing as deep as you would when you're awake. It's important because it is a very non-invasive way to assess how a patient is breathing.
