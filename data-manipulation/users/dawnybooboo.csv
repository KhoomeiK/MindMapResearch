depression,fcbaqfg,t3_egu121,1577584567.0,"This is me. Lately I have two moods. Really sad/distraught or just numb and feeling nothing. Feeling nothing is probably one of the worst parts. I just want to be alone at all hours of the day, not interact with anyone. Over the last year I've pushed my friends away. Not like it was that hard though, I didnt have many and most of them moved to another state after graduating college. It's easy to not have the motivation to answer a text. Or when they come to town fake being busy. It's even easier pushing people away now for me. I'm younger then my other friends so still in college. And it's probably quite obvious I'm not out making new friends. It sucks when all you want to do is feel something, get out there and meet new people, but not having the desire or motivation to do so. I used to go to therapy when I struggled when I was younger, and it helped. But that therapist died. I've tried going back, but all my new therapist asks me is ""why?"" To every little thing I have issues with its ""why do you feel that way?"" Sometimes you just dont know why you feel what you're feeling, but that's not a good enough answer for her. I haven't gone back to therapy in a while. The supposed ""help"" I'm getting isn't working, so I'd rather sit and be numb alone."
