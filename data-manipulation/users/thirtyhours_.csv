ADHD,felnmh3,t3_epkbci,1579226489.0,"YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!!!!

Make a list of the things that reoccur every week - especially the things that you have trouble with. Try to schedule them in for a specific time each week! Learning to use time management tools is the single greatest thing. Sometimes our ADHD brains just rack up insane amounts of tasks and we get overwhelmed. 

The single most effective tools you can use are a todo list and a time blocking app. I recommend having a weekly todo list and a daily todo list. Every night before you sleep, take a few things off of the weekly todolist and put it on your daily todo list. In the morning when you wake up, schedule what's there and put in the time of day you want to do it. 

This is important so it reminds you - make sure it'll send you a notification! Us ADHD'ers tend to lose track of time, space, and even the tasks we're working on. When this builds up over time and you still are nowhere near getting everything done - this is when a melt down happens. 

So get ahead of this and realize when you're getting off track ASAP with reminders! With that being said, I am totally not doing what I'm supposed to be doing right now so I need to get back on track. My reminder just reminded me ;). Best of luck!"

ADHD_Programmers,fec1x97,t1_ezol5i8,1578965441.0,"u/TamOShanter01 make sure you get enough vitamin D lol.. your brain depends on the sun to guide it's circadian rhythm and it actually affects you in wholistic, expanding ways if you never get sunlight. so at least try to get outside in the sunlight for like 30 minutes if youre in the dark all day"
Chinavisa,fe8rg9j,t1_fe6gt9r,1578929690.0,"Basically wondering what the legality is of getting paid to do work for a company in China on an L or X2 visa. The company has two entities, one Chinese, one Canadian. I think it's strictly illegal for them to pay me through the Chinese one so it makes sense for them to try the Canadian one (though this could be considered tax evasion). I'm wondering if it's legal or not to work for Chinese citizens through a Canadian entity, while living in China. Essentially, I would like to work for their company, but want to ensure I don't run into any legal issues while doing so."
ADHD_Programmers,fe6a5ju,t3_d1m7lh,1578885230.0,"YES - this is when my brain goes into deep focus. literally i can work for hours straight non stop like this. thought i was the only one.. lying in bed on my stomach - lights off, headphones in, fidgeting my leg = stream of consciousness for me."
selfimprovement,fe06y7i,t3_engpp4,1578804659.0,"I would highly recommend seeing a psychiatrist or a therapist.. 

It's possible you have PTSD or maybe ADHD?"
NoFap,fdgf089,t1_fdftk57,1578393719.0,"Trust the process man. Definitely don't get down on yourself. Think about all the other good in your life you've maintained until now - keep going with that. A relapse is by no means the end of this journey towards self improvement. If you don't think you can hold off the PMO any longer, that's totally alright. Keep up the other stuff in your life and you can always revisit NoFap when your brain is recovered. It's possible you stretched your brain to it's limit - it's good to push yourself to your limit. You have not failed my brother, you've just begun! Keep that self talk positive."
NoFap,fdfp2ug,t3_el5cd9,1578366823.0,Why is this being deleted???
NoFap,fdfh4xt,t1_fdeypu7,1578361571.0,"I think the danger that lies in peeking on long streaks is that it feels so good. The dopamine high is simply insane coming off a long streak - but you'll soon realize if you keep going with the peeking, you'll find your brain slowly returning to a mush like state for several days afterwards. I highly urge you to exercise intensely for as long as it takes for that urge to peek to subside.. I'm just coming out of the brain fog from relapse and it was so ridiculously not worth it.

Stay strong brother - never forget that those 183 days were hard earned. Keep fighting the good fight. I set up covenant eyes and cold turkey a few days ago which has helped me stave off the chasers to a point where I think I'm good to resist on my own. Do what you gotta do brother and never forget why we started this journey!"
selfimprovement,fdcxe20,t1_fdb7sqq,1578287120.0,"Simply put man you need to strike a balance between your life of new habits and the aspects of life that you miss that are making you feel like things are too boring.

This is why you should engage in these ""fun"" activities still. You may find that you remember what it's like to be present and spontaneous again after trying them. It doesn't hurt to try. Worst case scenario is that you decide you don't want to do it anymore.

Be a person man. Don't just stay in your head all the time fixing problems. Oftentimes that creates more problems than are necessary. Life isn't meant to be perfect, we just need to handle the essentials (career, finances, social relationships, romantic relationships)."
selfimprovement,fd689c0,t3_ek3vyp,1578187002.0,"You probably have anxiety and do too much doomsday philosophizing in your head, getting fixated on problems and thinking about how bad life could be if you didn't solve them..

You should address the underlying anxiety - meditate, exercise regularly, and if you are super structured then work with it. Don't beat yourself up for not being able to be like them, everyone is different. 

Schedule like 15-20 minutes a day of watching comedy sketches or something. If you want to be more like them the stimulus you take in has to change. Try to go do something you'd never ordinarily do just to stretch that new part of your mind.

Keep it up with the introspection though. Introspection is useful if you can use it to fix the underlying problems but keep in mind humans are bound to be problematic to a large degree so don't hold yourself to a standard of perfection. 

Just let go at some point every day and be present with your physical self rather than with your thoughts. Stretching and exercise can help with that too."

NoFap,fd1ydm3,t3_ejv2z5,1578138752.0,"Jesus christ this might be one of the most beautiful things I've ever read.. Fuck.. I've relapsed like 7 times after a streak of 112 days. I want what you've found so, so ridiculously badly.   


I feel empty as fuck since relapsing and I see my life going back to where it was before. Bruh. This can't be it for me. 

I need to get back on my Nofap game and I need to go the hardest I've ever gone in my life.."
selfimprovement,fcu2zc6,t3_eiun3k,1577970973.0,"Professional goals, personal relationships, romance, health & fitness, and optimistic mentality.

Start working on all of those things first if you do a self evaluation and any of them come up short.

By working on things I mean make a plan, write it down, and take the steps to bring yourself closer to them.

Then worry about ""doing something meaningful.""

The thing is you have this mercurial idea of ""doing something big"" and ""doing great things,"" as something that is not routine.

If you ask any successful entrepeneur or anyone who has had this major success of which you're referring to, it most likely entirely came from routine. Nobody woke up one day and decided ""I'm going to be Bill Gates in like 7 hours.""

They, like you are doing right now, either consciously or subconsciously made a plan and followed through with it.

If you feel like having and working towards your dream job meaningful, it might not be your dream job. There isn't necessarily a ""dream job,"" just something that we are content and fulfilled doing. 

It sounds like you aren't currently fulfilled. That doesn't mean you should throw it all away though - you just need to deeply assess what you want out of life.

Carve out some empty time in your routine to just think and be present with yourself, listen to what arises."
selfimprovement,fcu0nb8,t3_dhd4no,1577968440.0,FUCK YEAH
NoFap,fcj0zxw,t1_fcizxe9,1577674586.0,For sure man - didn't mean to object I fully agree haha. Peeking is the devil.
NoFap,fciygqe,t3_eh6bw8,1577672849.0,It's not a micro-injection of dopamine.. It's a macro injection of dopamine. Most of dopamine is released from watching porn and discovering novel imagery. Oxytocin and serotonin are whats usually released upon orgasm. So yeah - edging is fucking awful for you haha.
NoFap,fcbekr6,t1_fcbe7qy,1577585904.0,"congrats on 21 days man. at this point in your recovery you should savor every day you get. once you get to day 90-100 you can throw out the day counts and then focus on making the days count, but until then you should be stoked every time you wake up with a clean streak ;P."

NoFap,fcb1hvw,t1_fcb02n1,1577580876.0,"basically my grandma is gonna die soon and i’m gonna have to accept a job that’s beneath my pay grade.  

these are two realities i just need to accept.

the only thing that will keep me going on the path to success is discipline, persistence, adaptability and introspection. 

throughout this streak i’ve implemented tons of new habits in my life - maybe more than i should have. i plan on keeping those alive and well as i move forward. 

gonna forgive myself for this slip up, not as an excuse to return to using but to maintain that i have self worth regardless.

it’s going to be okay."
NoFap,fcb07v3,t1_fcb02n1,1577580087.0,"yeah man ive been going through some hard times. in retrospect i was trying to suppress my emotions. family issues, career stress/uncertainty and whatnot."
