It isnt because you have the appendix removed but because of infections causing things to go haywire. For a lack of a better word.

That being said, being lactose intolerant is not 100% intolerance. There is a scale. Some can handle more than others. Some products have more lactose than others.

But you do not really cure IBS. You find what might irritate your bowel and stay clear of it. But you still have IBS.

Do the colonoscopy. I did it couple of days ago and is not very rough. Granted I did get a really effective relaxant which helped a lot. Ask for it. It'll essentially get you zoned out in a way.

There is so much that the MD can see in this procedure and also not see, which is good in of itself.

My mother has Crohn's disease and my colonoscopy pretty much made sure I knew I didnt have it too and instead it is IBS.

Good luck!"

Conservative,fe7rcfy,t3_enrsgr,1578918304.0,"A lot of us Swedes think it is quite pathetic how our government is so hell bent on saving the climate and putting all these restrictions on us. When Sweden has what, 0.0002% influence on climate change? (Fictional procentage)

Saving the climate is great and should obviously be on priority. But when Sweden barely do anything bad towards nature in the large scheme of things (compared to other nations) all these taxes and laws is just worthless. Sweden can be 100% clean energy, not using plastic and using ""scrubbers"" and it still wouldn't do anything for the climate because of countries like India and China.

Tax on the plastic bag because people in the ""third world"" dont know what recycling is or proper landfills. Cause, obviously it will save the turtles if we Swedes have to pay more for our plastic bags.

A lot of the ""climate change"" talk is towards us the average citizen. Which is so dirty because we're the ones who cause the least problems. While it is corporations and politicians who cause the most.

It is like listening to all these Hollywood actors and actresses who preach about climate change and then use private jets on the weekly.
