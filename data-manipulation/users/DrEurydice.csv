ChoosingBeggars,ffxw6zn,t3_evsu2g,1580333622.0,"These people who offer exposure have probably all spent a lot of money on some ""mastermind"" course where they are told how they never have to pay for anything just by offering ""exposure."""
CasualConversation,ffxtrsv,t1_ffxl6jv,1580332263.0,"Gosh, yes. I should have read a few more posts before replying because my comment was about this. 

I am terrified of something like this happening. I just want to be able to help when I can and not be exposed online so someone else can get a lot of likes."
offmychest,ffs9zua,t1_ffrrzi3,1580176762.0,I know someone named Princess. When someone asks if that's her real name she has this look that dares them to make a joke about it or say anything cute. Someone asked her if she ever considered changing it and she said possibly when she's older she will change it to something more mature like The Queen.
offmychest,ffs8cjg,t1_ffr5r7i,1580175633.0,What a cutie! So glad you found her and took her home.
offmychest,ffs7nwh,t3_euofsg,1580175158.0,"I totally agree and I love dogs. Responsible dog owners should never allow their dogs to get near other people without that person's permission. Especially if the dog owner has not trained the dog and can't control it.

I hate retractable leashes. Hate them. I have trained numerous dogs to walk loose/slack leash, meaning the dog knows it can walk when the lease is not tight, but if the leash becomes taut they have to stop. Then the owner complains that the dog runs around and pulls on the leash, and every single time it's because they decided to use a retractable leash.

My father is one of those people who can't believe every person in the world doesn't love his dog. His best friend of over about 70 years is very uncomfortable around dogs, yet my dad let's his dog jump all over him."

venturebros,ffs6n1r,t3_eusze6,1580174441.0,"There's a club in Birmingham, Al that has a dance floor that was the inspiration for the one in the movie. One of my cousins had his wedding reception there. Unfortunately, his now ex-wife nixed the whole disco theme for the wedding and reception. That would have been groovy."
CasualConversation,ffreerf,t3_euqfaj,1580156395.0,"I like helping out strangers too. I work in merchandising, so I spend a lot of time in stores working, but I dont work for the stores. People just assume I work there since I am doing work.

I usually tell them I'm not an employee of so and so, but if I can help, I will. Usually, it's helping them locate a product. It's no big deal and I like feeling useful.

The other day, I was finished with my work and a lady asked if I worked there. I said no, but I would gladly help if I could. I ended up helping her all around the store, getting items from the lower shelves that were shoved to the back so she thought it was out of stock, checking prices, all kinds of things. It was fun for me and she thanked me and said how much she appreciated it.

About 75% of the time, I don't get thanked. I don't mind unless the person is really rude."
typewriters,ff4mpgb,t3_erecxl,1579567348.0,"That's nice. Now I will be on the lookout for one. I have a writing desk that people think is a useless thing until I show them how it opens.

Someone on my local Facebook marketplace has a nice typewriter desk listed. I was going to contact them about it until I saw that not only had they listed it at a lower price previously, but they had dropped that price to about half what they are asking for it now.

Edited to add: Talk about Baader-Meinhof happening... Browsing marketplace tonight, a new typewriter is listed and it's photographed on a typewriter desk like this in excellent condition. Unfortunately, desk is not for sale or I might have to make room for it."
NoStupidQuestions,ff2wsfa,t3_er1vm8,1579527069.0,"I usually won't answer a call from a number I dont know and it started long before caller ID was a thing. I used to screen all calls with my answering machines. Friends knew I did it and it wasn't that I dont want to talk. 

I think I have a slight fear every phone call will be bad news."
thisisus,ff23fi5,t1_fefpj2a,1579492741.0,"I can relate to this. Short version of what happened to me was I was alone in a cabin on the lake in a heavily wooded area. Winter, no neighbors. Just me. I was asleep when I woke up to the sound of someone opening the front door, then they slowly walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge.

 I have no idea how long they were in there before leaving because I was frozen. I could not move. I kept hoping I was having a terrifying dream. At one point, I couldn't even hear anything because I was so afraid I got this whirring sound in my ears. 

After the person left, I lay there a very long time listening to see if I heard them outside again, then I pushed the only piece of furniture in the room besides the bed in front of the door, and sat on the floor peaking over the bed towards the windows until daylight."
CasualConversation,fekwswj,t3_epp8oq,1579209226.0,"I had a nail fall off or rather removed after an accident. It grew back in a slightly different shape than before. If I had a favorite fingernail it would be that one because it actually looks a lot nicer than the others.

Hope your finger feels better soon."
Hyperhidrosis,fek91br,t3_epd0l7,1579195131.0,"I used to have massively sweaty pits and would choose that over hands sweating. I've seen the pictures in here, seen how it affected the person's ability to do things like use paper products, touch screens, etc. 

Now, if it were just the occasional sweaty palm in social situations, if go for sweaty hands since I'm female and can get away with not shaking hands. I don't even have sweaty hands and will refuse a handshake if at all possible."
Hyperhidrosis,fek8oyw,t3_epgb47,1579194929.0,"Botox side effects aren't restricted to reason for use. I have had it for migraines which involved a lot of shots in my forehead. Someone who gets it in their brow for HH would be at risk for the same side effects as i was. 

Overall, in my opinion, it is safe when administered by an experienced professional."
Hyperhidrosis,feblvw9,t3_eo8c7t,1578960157.0,"ohmygosh, I can relate. I used to work in a fitness center.  I rarely used the facilities because of how much I would sweat people thought I wasn't in shape. I would get so frustrated when I would be on the machines working hard and someone who never broke a sweat because they basically sat on a machine doing leisurely motions while gossiping with a neighbor or on the phone would scowl at me and go, ""Why are you sweating?"" 

This makes me curious... Did anyone else when they were in really good shape think they were in bad shape because they sweat a lot during activity?"
ChoosingBeggars,fe5i687,t1_fe4uh3w,1578869765.0,"I used to own an antique store, so I had to deal with a lot of people telling me why I should sell an item to them for 0-1% of what I was asking for it. When someone said ""the customer is always right"" I would ask, ""Right about what?"" Or I would tell them a customer was a person who buys something, not beg for it.

Good thing I was the owner or I might have had to fire me."
keto,fdid7iw,t1_fdh4sok,1578440242.0,"Mine too. It has been nonstop. I just started keto again after over 6 months off it. Less than a week, no major weight loss which I wouldn't expect, but already am in less pain from what the doctors say is fibromyalgia and have more energy than I have had in months. Yeah, keto is so horrible."
TheMaskedSinger,fdicem1,t1_fdhlf46,1578439740.0,Exactly what I was thinking. It's just a clever ruse .
ChoosingBeggars,fdhk8ce,t3_el5mjh,1578424409.0,"I like your response. It wasn't defensive, just came across really genuine. More businesses need to learn that this is how you respond and it's not hard to do. Play up your good points, recognize their grievance without bowing down to it.

So what exactly would be reasonable? Someone who took a long time to schedule, didn't show up on time, didn't do the job well, but charged less?

But ugh, how dare you do the job you agreed to quickly and efficiently and for the price you quoted. Absolutely ridiculous. I mean, you didn't gouge them or drag out the job making it take longer. I bet your movers were even courteous! And showing up on time? Who does that? I can't believe you expect to be paid a fair price for quality service."
penpals,fdhjdps,t3_el73wc,1578423894.0,"Hi. 50/F/US would love to snail mail with you. I am ruled by an old dog and a young cat. I also sew, read, dance in my brain and outside. I recently realized that when I drive through standing water I quietly say, ""Splash,"" but have not determined if I loudly say it when I go through one fast.  I love to learn new things and suspect I might be a nice person because of the amount of time I spend helping strangers while shopping."

TheMaskedSinger,fdfa5ox,t3_el09fl,1578356889.0,"I would like them to tone down the sob stories. It is hard to feel sympathy for someone who is talented, wealthy, and attractive. Call it sour grapes because I am none of those things, but I just wind up rolling my eyes most of the time."
BobsBurgers,fdcjsw2,t3_ekl88t,1578276659.0,"Awesome. The way they stare. I can't stop staring back and thinking they're waiting for something. Should I be doing something? Now, I feel like I'm letting the kids down. But they're great!"
Hyperhidrosis,fd4wam0,t3_ek0eyz,1578171630.0,"And that's why you go to a dermatologist/specialist instead of a general practitioner.  Did your family doctor tell you why he doesn't think you should take oxybutynin?

I spent my teen years dealing with a family doctor who didn't think my sweating was anything to be really concerned with . The most he ever did was prescribe an antiperspirant that gave me a horrible burn-like rash, and when I stopped using it decided that was proof it was not that big of a concern. At the time, I sweat from my armpits so much that I would wear loose oversized shirts. The sweat would run down my sides and the waistband of my jeans would be soaked. I showed this to him, but his only suggestion ever was the antiperspirant.

And just wanted to add - I don't think doctors take this seriously because they don't realize what an impact it has on our daily lives."

offmychest,fd2lcqg,t3_ejuxbw,1578148858.0,"I used to make paper cranes just to keep my focus in one thing, to calm my thoughts I guess. I used those memo cubes that are 500 sheets to a cube. 

I finally stopped making cranes because I realized I had bags full of them. Sometimes I use them for packing material when I need to shop something."
BobsBurgers,f76zve2,t3_dub3ku,1573440148.0,"Every time someone posts a picture of a burger like this it makes me more determined to make this book mine. If I don't get this book for my birthday, I will be very disappointed in my family. If I have to buy it myself, I plan to cut all the recipes down to make just one burger for myself, which I will eat in front of them while watching Bob's Burgers.  Seems fair."
