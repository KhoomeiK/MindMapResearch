bayarea,ffdn6ne,t3_eszni6,1579824451.0,"I tell non-Bay Area people my commute is an hour door to door on Caltrain and they gawk at me. They're like, how can you sit on a train for an hour? I tell them I have no transfers, my company pays for my go pass and i'm incredibly fortunate to live 10 mins walking from the closest station. I don't mind it, it could be worse. I pay out the nose for it in terms of rent but it could be worse. I used to depend on Bart from East Bay to Montgomery and that was a typical shit show (ah the summer of the Bart strike).

I just wish the schedule was more frequent. I'm at a stop that typically gets 1 train an hour. I have to coordinate correctly but if i'm running late and missing the train, I'm instantly an hour late. Or if Caltrain is having problems, my commute can shift to 90 mins to 2 hours.

I'm incredibly fortunate but I do wish the system would get better. We're a major city, why does our public transit not match it?

As a side note, I visited London and their system was a *DREAM*."

Second: I volunteer at a shelter and we brought in cats that are borderline feral. They're like, young adults. They were fine when they were briefly fostered before being brought to the shelter. They're (rightfully so) freaked out and are hissing, swatting, and spitting at us. We have to put towels over our hands to even get a bowl in their condo. They're eating and drinking and not hiding so that's progress but man, we're playing the long game with these guys."

orangetheory,ff66e4c,t1_ff5ruac,1579620232.0,I’ve been going there since December 2017 and I think the studio had been open for about a year at that point. It’s pretty popular gym (next to public transit in a densely populated area) so I’m not sure funds are an issue.

&#x200B;

I'm used to going 3-4 days in a row (it's amazing with stress management for me) but my husband isn't. He's used to 1 maybe 2 days in a row. Since we both have the day off and today's a partner workout, I told him we should go together. Rower is always a challenge for him whereas I keep fairly good stamina and I'm able to keep a strong, consistent base. 

When we started the Capture the Flag portion of the class, I hit the rower hard. I did about 1200m in 4 mins. He was struggling but kept at it and we eventually got the green and orange flags. Class was beginning to wind down and when it was time to switch for the last time (me going to the floor, him on the rower), we were 500m from 5,000m. I told him as I was getting off the rower to get that red flag for me. 

He pushed himself so hard those last 2 mins, the coach came over and was cheering him on. It came down to the wire but as the coach was calling time, my husband had hit 5000m and we got the red flag.

He immediately laid down on the ground, panting and probably cursing the day I was born.

It was a great workout and my husband has earned his rest days as well as the donut I later purchased for him."

orangetheory,fdla48h,t3_elytnw,1578519672.0,"Fellow power walker, I usually do about 6% between 4.0 and 4.5. I think the last time I did it I was able to hold 4.5 the whole time. It was brutal but I'm not sure where to go from there. Hypothetically I could increase my incline but if i'm going 4.5 my time is going probably be the same. 

For me, it's less about the time it takes to complete the workout but how i'm pushing my body. I would focus on upping your incline if you can and see how long you can hold 3.9 or 4.0 at a 6% or 8% incline. Find that challenge spot and charge at it. You may not make huge leaps when it comes to your benchmark but you'll be pushing your limits. 

I would like to see where my mile would be if I jogged but my hips would be so angry at me the days to follow."

Back in the 90s, there was a massive hurricane that ripped through Kauai and chickens were broken loose. Since they have no natural predator on the island, there's been no population control and they're basically every where.

Overtime, I gradually started hating the stairs less and less. Before, I would be huffing and puffing minutes after climbing the stairs but now, it’s much more manageable.

orangetheory,fcux9nx,t1_fcuulwo,1577990372.0,"There’s a difference between telling OTF not to sell your data and deleting it with this new law. 

Filling out the request form, you have a chance to specify between the two. My guess, if you’re a former member, you can ask OTF to delete your information. Otherwise, they can keep it but they aren’t allowed to sell it (so long as you fill out the form telling them so)."
orangetheory,fcuw3ig,t1_fcutbt0,1577989720.0,"Hi,

Just for clarification, it’s a lot more than just selling your email address (for OTF and beyond). 

From the article:

‘Here’s a top-level summary of some of its basic tenets:

+ Businesses must disclose what information they collect, what business purpose they do so for and any third parties with whom they share that data.
+ Businesses will be required to comply with official consumer requests to delete that data.
+ Consumers can opt out of their data being sold, and businesses can’t retaliate by changing the price or level of service.
+ Businesses can, however, offer “financial incentives” for being allowed to collect data.
+ California authorities are empowered to fine companies for violations.’

OTF will be required to inform users what data they intend to sell (if they do so). My guess would be the data would include how much a user spends annually at OTF, frequency of attendance, gender, possibly IP information if they collect it, maybe how engaged the user is in workouts (challenges, campaigns, etc), and more. Obviously I’m guessing but now we’ll know for sure and users can judge if they choose to opt out or not.

Agreed, there’s a lot to clean up in the law but I think it’s generally a good first step.

orangetheory,fctmh1z,t3_eipcw4,1577948915.0,"My biggest advice is not to do flash in the pan diets or quick ways to lose weight. These are short term answers and don’t really serve you any good in the long term. Plus you’re most likely to fail. I took the approach of changing my relationship with food and being active. 

I was very strict on tracking all my food on MyFitnessPal and absolutely cut out alcohol, pastry, and candy (minus a piece of dark chocolate to satisfy those cravings).

Also, outside of the studio, I walked a lot. I would usually walked my whole lunch hour while playing PokemonGo

Plus, have open conversations with your coach. Utilize their advice and feedback.

Also know that it’s just the beginning! I won the TC challenge at my studio and at the end of the year lost a total of 55 lbs. it’s super encouraging and makes you want to keep going."
