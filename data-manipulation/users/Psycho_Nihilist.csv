todayilearned,ffecmmi,t3_et0aby,1579843200.0,What’s the point? I could’ve waited 5 minutes then went in and got the cooked pork myself instead of having to wait 6 months for it. Maybe just send em a thank you card next time.

SuicideWatch,fcjouis,t1_fcjod8b,1577697162.0,You can either give in and let this problem consume you both or leave her to her to fight her own demons. There’s no simple cut and dry solution here. She needs help you can’t give her though.
SuicideWatch,fcjooc3,t1_fcjnxxk,1577696914.0,I know words seem hollow and empty. Maybe they are.
SuicideWatch,fcjo3mh,t3_ehjlf7,1577696092.0,Honestly this seems like an attention grab. Don’t let drag you down. She needs to find the strength to live on her own. You can’t find happiness through other people.
SuicideWatch,fcjnzua,t3_ehjm8c,1577695949.0,Seems like your BF needs you. Maybe this is the year to make a change. Work to become the person you want to be.

SuicideWatch,fcjmxmj,t3_ehix42,1577694475.0,"The holidays for me are dark and suffocating. You can choose your friends but not your family. I suggest spending time around people you actually enjoy being around when you can. People with similar interests who like you for just being you. I spent my holiday drinking in solitude mostly. On Christmas Day I accidentally shot a hole through my brother in laws car. My family will never let me live that down. But fuck them, I’ve got better shit to do than let them ride my ass about all my short comings. I won’t let them have the satisfaction"

You’ve got a few options on the table it seems. You could take a shot in the dark and try talking to a friend. But it seems like you’re still figuring things out. Clear to me, suicide isn’t the answer. You need to discover yourself. You’re frustrated because you feel trapped and feel like there’s no way out. I assure you, that in time you will discover who you really are. Learn to love yourself.

Stop focusing on what others think. People are overrated."
