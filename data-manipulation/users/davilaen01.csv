relationship_advice,fgu3fn5,t3_f0eycc,1581112853.0,"Unless you you both are up for having an open relationship/threesomes then the relationship will continue fine. From what you’ve said, you were not into it and basically pressured into it. This ruined the relationship and you lose all respect for each other. You need to get out of it and have respect for yourself. She will continue to push you into this more often if you let her. I don’t see how you could back from something like this."
Parenting,fgsw29s,t1_fgstjr7,1581093845.0,Lol yes definitely no butt on the furniture.
Parenting,fgso6m6,t1_fgsnc5o,1581089032.0,"My son’s was the diaper, too. He also hated clothes. The first thing he did getting home was drop all his clothes until he was just in a diaper or underwear. He still would rather be naked."
aww,fgsg1er,t3_f05stq,1581083331.0,Oh wow so adorable!
aww,fgqj4sn,t1_fgqe2tg,1581025192.0,I love your poems!
marriageadvice,fgqivat,t1_fgqeryc,1581025037.0,This is truth! I didn’t find out some stuff about my ex’s affair until years later. They definitely don’t tell you everything.
marriageadvice,fgq6xlt,t3_ezvq3o,1581019013.0,Oh I love valentines and Easter. We have a tradition that I give them baskets on those holidays. The baskets are filled with goodies. It doesn’t necessarily need to be all valentines candy. I usually add a small stuffed animal that they love and the gifts change as they age. Sometimes it’s an outfit or sometimes just small things they are into at the time.
AmItheAsshole,fgo18r9,t3_ezh59r,1580957456.0,YTA for lying to your husband not for wanting to do a reduction. You know what you will be able to handle. You need to speak to you husband because these are his kids as well. This is a decision made by both.
AmItheAsshole,fgnzxpm,t3_ezhz4s,1580956618.0,NTA. She definitely didn’t tell the whole story and what’s with calling her own brother an idiot the whole time. She has no respect for anyone at all. I’m really glad when we are able to see both sides of these posts. It really reinforces that she is most definitely an asshole!
aww,fgnmi5i,t3_ezf01r,1580948077.0,Beautiful!
marriageadvice,fgnm8z5,t1_fgnii84,1580947907.0,This was the best post I’ve seen in a while. You didn’t hold anything back and hopefully OP will open her eyes. You are the best friend every girl should have!
iamatotalpieceofshit,fgn8qfe,t1_fgmyy3z,1580939814.0,Oh god you’re one of those...
iamatotalpieceofshit,fgmmh7x,t3_ezajai,1580927594.0,There could of been someone crazy on that flight who could have gotten so angry and scared at the prospect of maybe dying. He could have killed the prankster. Sorry...I always think of the worse case scenario lol
Parenting,fgmlunw,t3_ez9ylu,1580927221.0,It’s awesome to see someone give chores. My kids have been doing chores since a young age as well. They can now wash their own clothes at 11 and 14. They have worried about being able to take care of themselves when they go off to college and this gives them confidence that they will be. We have started on cooking lessons now. One of the things I have made them do as well is get up to an alarm for school. Once they start working and on their own they won’t have issues with getting to work and class on time. They now know they have to be ready for the bus at a certain time and know they have x amount of time to get ready. They actually pick out a time to set the alarm knowing how long it takes. I am so proud of them actually just thinking about it. Lol
nosleep,fgmlcf3,t3_ezav5u,1580926916.0,Oh this was really good and didn’t expect the ending. Keep doing the good work of the dark side.
AmItheAsshole,fgmkm2o,t3_ezb2co,1580926483.0,NTA. I really gets me how many brides pull this shit. I think in every one I have seen they have all been called out for being the asshole. Do not ever change your appearance for anyone. Your hair is beautiful and you can have fun somewhere else without compromising yourself.
AmItheAsshole,fglubqt,t3_ez2l16,1580911122.0,"YTA Maybe you should talk to the nurse about what’s really going on. This way you can keep a supply for your daughter there at the school. I would also apologize to the nurse. It’s their job to look out for the kids. Also, bring up why you were angry about her automatically assuming you were not doing right by your child. If you talk to her then you can both figure out a way to keep a supply there for her and your daughter stops missing school."
shortscarystories,fgls307,t3_ez0ygb,1580909522.0,This was really good. Keep up the good work.
marriageadvice,fgl9hz1,t3_ez5ggo,1580886964.0,"Is he doing drugs, have mental issues lately that you have been noticing? These are some of the things I have seen personally that can make someone do something out of character. I am not saying these are the only things but it’s a good place to start. Since you say he has never gotten physical with you before it’s probably a good idea to start looking for outside help. You do not want this to escalate and he finds it easier to quickly let his anger get out of hand. He could have been holding in things for so long he finally “snapped”, also. Find you two counseling because you do not want to excuse this behavior."
Psychic,fgl062d,t3_ez2lju,1580878041.0,N.A and J.A- Capricorn for me (N.A) and Pisces for J.A. Can you please tell me if our marriage will get better. There have been tons of problems and I’m just on the fence about what to do.
LetsReadOfficial,fgktd4o,t3_ez1i2t,1580873164.0,This was crazy and scary! Glad he’s okay and lived to tell the tale.
Fibroids,fgkkhwc,t3_eyunup,1580867671.0,"Yes I have, but it was normal they said. If it doesn’t go away in a couple of days I’m going to definitely call again."
witchcraft,fgha9om,t3_eybxcr,1580780315.0,This sounds like an awesome adventure. Best of luck to you!
AmItheAsshole,fgha5va,t3_eyeje1,1580780247.0,NTA. I just had surgery and on Oxy for pain. I had a procedure that required me to be cut open like if I was having a csection. I can’t for one moment imagine not being able to take my meds for pain. I have to have one every 4 hrs just to move around. Get away and stay away from your crazy boyfriend who I hope at this point is your ex.
offmychest,fgeshqk,t3_exza7r,1580708429.0,This is awesome and you live the life I could only dream of living. Keep living your best life!
Parenting,fg811s4,t3_exc22d,1580606671.0,He’s 7. He doesn’t understand much apart from the attention he’s getting at home. Fight for him and one day he will grow out of it. Whose to say his mom won’t have more kids later on and he’s in the same situation at home. Best of luck to you.
AmItheAsshole,fg4s8rb,t3_ewr3ot,1580509970.0,NTA. Wow this is the first time I’m hearing this from a groom and it’s ridiculous. I do not understand issues with wedding parties hair. Each person is unique and this is why we should care about them even more. There’s no fun in having everyone look exactly the same.
happy,fg3obdc,t3_ewn5vn,1580486138.0,Happy Friday! Hope today is awesome for you and you have those good feelings everyday. The necklace is so cute by the way.
marriageadvice,fg3nn9i,t3_ewpsd2,1580485723.0,You need to find a way to let go. He doesn’t respect you and basically humiliates you by going to your friend. Know your worth and know that this is not a relationship you want to stay in. You deserve to be loved and respected!
witchcraft,fg3fav8,t3_ewhp77,1580480055.0,So sorry you’re going through this and I really hope someone is able to find him.  Keep pushing the police to help you in case they think he just left willingly.
AmItheAsshole,fg2nnfx,t3_ewchrz,1580449137.0,NTA. Your living your best life in they fairy garden. Enjoy it!
AskReddit,fg2nctt,t1_fg1lw5h,1580448869.0,"I had to read this twice because I was so confused about why they would go about it that way. Really it’s a fucked up thing to do and I would have walked away from both, too."
Fibroids,fg0fszv,t3_ew81px,1580406900.0,I think if your doctors are not wanting to help you it’s time to get a new doctor who will. That is not a way to live and it sounds like it’s causing you issues in your relationship or soon will.
nosleep,ffzspvp,t3_ew28wb,1580391801.0,I can’t wait to read more as well and sorry for you loss. I definitely would stay away from those movies as I wouldn’t want to know what else is going to happen.
nosleep,ffzs5ay,t3_evo0y5,1580391327.0,Noooo.
aww,ffzqiv0,t3_ew27th,1580389936.0,Awww. Cutest kitty ever!
