The relationship you have with him is father and son. The only reason it would be important to anyone to go by blood relation is the social idea of familial roles we play. Your the blood sibling yet you play the role of the father. Why? Because that’s what you are. You weren’t given the choice. Blood relations mean only what you make it mean.

I was a teenager when I was told my brother was actually my half brother and my dad (who raised us) was not his real father. Our dad is not related by blood to my younger brother. Does that make him not his dad? He stepped into a role that needed to be filled and raised another man’s child. You’ve done the same. As far as I’m concerned by brother is my brother and I wouldn’t care if he wasn’t related to me at all. Blood relations shouldn’t play a role in this and it’s certainly not your fault that you were put in such a tough spot so your relatives need to fuck off.

As bad as all that stuff is an infection can be so much worse. Dying do to a blood/skin infection is very painful and it does not relent. There are no good days.

WW2 is a bit different because we did win the war. We didn’t want to get involved with the war because it didn’t involve us, much like WW1, but we didn’t have a president wanting to join this time. The reason why is also the reason we won.

AdviceAnimals,fdkrz3g,t3_elt7t5,1578509920.0,"I got a new car recently. A few days after I got it it was drizzling in the middle of the day. My old truck had a switch you had to manually turn to turn the lights on so in the weather I’d have my lights on. The new car was automatic. The lights came on when it was dark. Of course you can manual turn them on, but I didn’t know how. Visibility was good for me so I didn’t think about it until I was already on the road. I got nervous because I couldn’t tell if my lights were on or not.

funny,fdi0bu5,t1_fdhyxkt,1578433452.0,"You make up some kind of bullshit about why you love doing what you’re trying to be hired to do. When I was being interviewed for a position in insurance I gave a speech about how I love helping people. I wasn’t lying, but the bottom line was I wasn’t there to help people. I mean I was, but my priority with that job was to be able to eat and not be homeless.

The thing to keep in mind is every single person working does it for money. That’s a given and isn’t something that needs to be explained. You’re there to separate yourself from all the other people trying to be hired. If you can make your employer believe you want the job more than everyone else then that’s another step towards not starving to death."

You’re still making assumptions about me based on literally nothing but the fact I don’t think you should be allowed to hit people for their words.

Bottom line: Physical oppression to ideologies you despise is, in fact, facism. Call yourself an antifacist if it makes you feel better, but it doesn’t change anything.

I will stand next to you and scream and argue with Nazis all day, but the second you start acting violently, you lose me. It’s not complicated. I understand the inability to remove emotion and apply rational thought, not many people can do it, but that’s what’s needed. They *want* you to attack them. It gives them an excuse. If you hit some dickhead nazi then you’ll be the one locked in jail while that same dickhead shows his black eye to dickheads like his as a way to rally anyone else on the fence. Then what will you do? Fill the jails with people like you while those dickheads continue to walk around spreading their vitriol uncontested.

This video is cruel because they are making (not teaching) the dog swim when it’s clearly not ready to. Introducing a puppy to deep water does literally nothing for it. Making it struggle to keep its head above water isn’t going to make any practical difference.

This and any other “training” session is not going to save a puppy if it fell into deep water with no way out and no one around to save it. The ability to swim well comes with age, when they are stronger, and if you’re going to train your dog to do anything water related that’s the time to do it."
