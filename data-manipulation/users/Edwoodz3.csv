Jail is not meant to be a nice place - they are there to be kept away from civilised society due to crimes. 

Whilst I don't agree with people who commit tax fraud being in the same situation as murderers and rapists, that's a different point -  I would be happy to give them access to luxuries such as television. But someone who has raped children or murdered people should be locked up with absolutely no access to TV or any form of luxury. Period."

Hormonal changes create a huge impact on the mental and emotional stability of teenagers. The frontal lobe is yet to develop so they literally act on emotional impulses. 

This doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt support them, however it means in most cases it would be hormonal shifts rather than the underlying mental health  you‚Äôd see in someone in their 20s or older.

Topic sentence
Expanding sentence
Example
Explanation
Link

The topic sentence is a directive statement - specifying exactly what your paragraph will discuss. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúin this paragraph I will discuss the characterisation of Jon Snow‚Äù instead, you would state ‚ÄúJon Snow is characterised as a strong and masculine character.‚Äù

The expanding sentence introduces the how - so how is Jon Snow characterised? You would say something like, ‚ÄúSnow‚Äôs heroic and courageous actions and his confident dialogue demonstrate his strong, masculine traits.‚Äù

The example is where you give a specific example from the text (may also be evidence) you‚Äôd want to give some context within the text here.

The explanation is where you explain how the example showcases your topic sentence and your expanding sentence.

Finally, your linking sentence will tie back into your thesis statement in your introduction.

We‚Äôre intrinsically emotional animals and feelings aren‚Äôt just natural, they‚Äôre one of the fundamental aspects that makes us human. 

She will be emotional because she will see others being emotional. There‚Äôs no avoiding this - but providing her with the support and a slight understanding of why people are being emotional will allow her to understand it all easier - if not now than in a few years time when she ‚Äúdeciphers‚Äù this memory."
