BC had a lot of “illegal” dispensaries that let you try samples or smoke there if you felt more comfortable. They would usually have some tea or coffee, maybe some cake or baked goods for customers. The BC ones were successful chains but they denied them licensing because they were established before the change in law and I think went with a business license lottery lol."

I mean large ships and subs sure, but planes I don’t see that working and cars are too small. A nuclear reactor uses steam for one, so a steam car seems like a horrible idea, there is also the issue of efficiency to scale and the inability to quickly throttle a reactor up and down.

unpopularopinion,fff6pop,t1_fff6h3e,1579877105.0,"Why, there was a market because consumers wanted them. It’s not like gift cards are extremely new idea, places like spas, golf courses, restaurants have offered them for a while and the rise in popularity was not because people started selling them but because people kept buying them. It starts with the consumer and if everyone was a little more honest and told people get me cash or don’t bother, they would go away just as quickly."

unpopularopinion,fff1xp1,t1_fff08v3,1579873470.0,"You see a baby as an existing person upon conception. You see it as an individual with the right to live. However that individual can not survive without the mother allowing it use her body, it also even today carries a lot of risk to the mother and possible death. So you feel a Mother must keep the baby alive and carry it to term and risk death and allow it to use her body which is basically saying the rights of the baby are above the rights of the Mother. It’s like saying everyone has a right to health care and saying a doctor is not allowed to not give care when it is asked of them. It is a non passive right, it is a right that forces someone to do something against their own will."

facepalm,fff0ibx,t1_fff0a1l,1579872276.0,Uhh move. If everyone who can’t afford to live in a city moved to a cheaper area the expensive city will loose essential workers and be forced to pay more than minimum.

If you argue that porn being at your finger tips is the problem than you need to look at everything at your finger tips. Is music an issue? Some seem addicted to it, always need it on, it’s always right there. So I think the porn thing needs more time. Stricter punishments or at least unusual punishments don’t seem to solve anything, however I think any potential victim of rape should be allowed to arm themselves to try and kill their attacker, even some what after the attack.

He at least sees that even after all the grooming and tries to do overall good. His personal properties are quite green but I doubt he has any say in retrofitting Buckingham palace.

We will not bow to China while they talk with the USaA, they should have put blame where blame was due and not on us.
