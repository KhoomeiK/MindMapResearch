What I'm claiming is that this was unnecessary and a big fat gimme to his followers who believe that prayer is banned from schools. It serves no purpose other than to sow discord and get him votes he already had. You're assuming that I'm a militant antitheist and you couldn't be farther from the truth.

No, what he's doing isn't harmful except for the fact that he's portraying this as making things different when nothing has really changed.

boomerhentai,fdt3d47,t1_fdt1num,1578711385.0,"Eh, I've talked about this before on Reddit and people just don't understand. It's a fairly recent phenomenon that kids between the ages of 13 and 18 are considered children. For centuries kids that age we're considered grown for the most part, and girls as property to be used to expand property or sell off for profit. We're getting away from the point here, but what I'm trying to say is even young girls were not seen as innocent as they are now. Besides all that, this cartoon would have just been seen as a joke, with no one in reality harmed. What really would have made it funny is just how wrong it is. Like when a comedian makes a joke that's in poor taste."
boomerhentai,fdt0itv,t1_fdszc0g,1578710345.0,"Well, you also have to understand (and I'll probably get downvoted for this) but a lot of those dudes mother's were married between the ages of 13 and 16. No shit. It's only been in the last 50 years or so that 18 was the minimum age that was acceptable for girls to be married. Young girls were married off, particularly in the South, at very young ages. Boys were working jobs at 14 or 15 and no longer going to school. Hell, getting to the 8th grade was an achievement in some places. The idea of a girl being ready to go was much earlier at that time. People these days don't want to accept that as true, but it is."
boomerhentai,fdsyyya,t1_fdsxick,1578709774.0,"Probably not for the most part. It was just a cartoon. It was no different than a cartoon about a boss demanding a blowjob from his secretary under the desk. Or any number of other scenarios that are disgusting. The show Mad Men is a good representation of male chauvinism that bled over into the 60s and 70s. I grew up in the 70s and it wasn't really until the 90s that things started to change. This being a cartoon, there was no child to protect. It wasn't associated with a real scenario. The mentality at the time would have seen this purely as a joke, not as an activity that actually happened. I don't know how to explain it other than that."
boomerhentai,fdswpcr,t1_fdsvn7j,1578708926.0,"I totally get what you're saying. If you go back and look at ""adult magazines"" from that era, you'll also find erotic fiction that's very disgusting, and tons and tons of parody and comics that would shock and offend now. It was a new freedom that had never been around before, and they pushed the envelope in all kinds of ways. And it was geared towards men, who were not the most sensitive at that time. We're talking about a generation of men that were taught that they were the leaders and providers, and that women and girls were there to serve them and be dependent on them."

[There's another post in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/boomerhentai/comments/emwxsh/old_playboy_comics_are_a_goldmine/) that's similar to this right now. Lots of cartoons from that time were very not today's PC. You also have to remember that this was way before the internet or even stranger danger. The most likely person that you knew of involved in child molestation was that weird Uncle that no one talked about and kept under the rug. It was easy to joke about because it was thought of as a myth, or at least a fantasy that didn't happen in the real world. It's much more real now, and something real can't be joked about."
