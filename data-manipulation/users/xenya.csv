If you truly want to discuss things, that's one thing, but you don't go about that the way you have. Will absolutely got those agents killed. He did not pull the trigger but he set them up to be killed. He conspired with the Dragon to break Hannibal out and allow the Dragon to kill him. He says as much when they are in the house having wine. Will may have wanted to be good and moral but it was not his nature to be so. Hannibal recognized that from the start."

Water is symbolic of life and being reborn. In dreams, it symbolizes the unconscious and emotions, so in this context I think it represents what's going on under the surface. He's changing even then, although he doesn't know it. Hannibal is breaking down the dam that has held Will's emotions in check and when it gives, he is likely to be swept away in the flood. 

Murder Will is best Will, IMO. :) 

I did not pay attention to the chairs, but I need to. Someone should do screen shots of episodes showing how far apart they are. :)

HannibalTV,ffrurmm,t3_euvqwp,1580166287.0,"I think it was a combination of things. Will's attempt to stab Hannibal seemed half-assed to me. You're going to go after Hannibal with a little pocket knife? Really?

So then Hannibal drugs him, cuts his head open in preparation to eat him, gets hung upside down in a meat truck, only to be met with the joy that is Mason and his marvelous entourage. He has the freakiest dinner party of all time, where he's told his face will be eating Hannibal from Mason's body, said face-cutting begins, and then he gets rescued and carried out of hell, bride style, by his boy. I think he was just completely done with all this shit by this time. 

And I don't blame him."
