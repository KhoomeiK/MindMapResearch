worldnews,ffyv0dn,t3_evp6ug,1580355828.0,Just another way to make Trump envious.  Watch Trump say that this is a good move for the Russians and the USA should do the same.
todayilearned,ffjrk6a,t3_etre48,1580005058.0,The winning team gets to live in a concentration camp and the losing team gets to go to a death camp. The losing coach gets blown up by a tank. Awesome stuff.
AmItheAsshole,ffjr0ts,t3_etsada,1580004700.0,"NTA. Trust your gut. This is your child’s first year of life. Four months is awfully young. But most importantly, there may be a reason you are having this gut reaction. Listen to it as a teacher. Why do feel the way you feel? What is it about your interactions with them that makes you feel uncomfortable? Are there physical or mental limitations that you are seeing? Are their stories your SO has told you that makes you feel uncomfortable? 

Finally, this is your SO’s boundary to hold and maintain, not yours. Discuss it with your SO and ask her/him to hold the agreed upon line."

insanepeoplefacebook,fer5mb4,t3_eqbl80,1579350111.0,Besides the fact that this person is clearly insane - what I love is the assumption that the right is so “pro cop” or pro justice. One look at the forgiveness given to a criminal and good running our country and you can see how corrupted this type of thinking is.

wholesomememes,fee0uol,t1_fedjc06,1579024041.0,Fair enough. I wrote too quickly.
wholesomememes,fed7fpd,t3_eoathq,1579002399.0,"For all the haters of this comment: there is a lot of research to suggest that when humans perceive other animals as having the same perspective as us, we minimize their needs almost entirely. It’s a form is self-centeredness that considers animals as extensions of us. 

My point is only that the meme (which is admittedly wholesome) could have stopped with Capybros and not defined a wild animal as a “person.”"
wholesomememes,fed76wy,t1_fecpqbr,1579002106.0,Your welcome.

StarWars,fd9zw42,t1_fd91uiq,1578240044.0,"Okay. So, I guess that the plans for the Death Star getting into the hands of Rebel force (specifically Princess Leia) doesn’t make it part of the Skywalker saga? The movie is far better than episodes I-III and directly sets up a New Hope. I guess it doesn’t “count.”"

spaceporn,fcp2azt,t1_fcnrkrb,1577848293.0,Completely agree. I think we will put all space travel on jeopardy because of environmental catastrophe and resource loss/consumption.
spaceporn,fcp23mp,t1_fcnx6eu,1577848116.0,"Perhaps. Im not so sure, though. It would take massive technological advances at the same time the world is moving towards environmental disaster,  resource consumption, and warfare that may make your vision nearly impossible. I’d be willing to make a bet. But in all likelihood, neither of us will be living to see that day."
spaceporn,fcp1khf,t1_fcp1htt,1577847652.0,Thanks. I didn’t post the original video with that lame title.
spaceporn,fcp0jfc,t1_fcosgyr,1577846772.0,I should have written from that vantage with our own being.

spaceporn,fcoxhyl,t1_fcotjs4,1577844292.0,"Maybe. Depends on whether or not we screw up our resources and ability to actually move vast quantities of people off of the planet. I’ll take the bet, unfortunately, that we will not make as a civilization to mass quantities of people - or all of humanity- leaving our planet. I’d make the bet with you but.....we won’t be around most likely."

spaceporn,fcolkk1,t1_fcojxbq,1577835288.0,"Yeah. I didn’t give it that title. I wouldn’t have said down, as “down” is everywhere in space."
spaceporn,fco75de,t1_fco45xx,1577825372.0,Yep. Far scarier.
SweatyPalms,fcnq7md,t3_ehvia5,1577816366.0,The title is a little silly considering “down” is in all directions.
