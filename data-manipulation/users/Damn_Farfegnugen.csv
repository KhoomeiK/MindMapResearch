Also YTA for thinking that divorce will, in any way, shape, or form, solve the actual main and critical issue here, which is not that you have a homophobic wife, but rather that your children have a homophobic mother. Focus. Swallow your pride and get smart on how you're going to soften her stance on this, because ultimatums aren't going to magically make there be fewer homophobes in the world. 

Do some research on the Imams in your area. I'm absolutely certain you'll be able to find at least one in the UK that preaches inclusion.

You seem kind of helpless, to be honest - not dumb, not mean, not anything bad, just, well, helpless, like you really have no idea how to put one foot after the other without an authority figure taking you by the hand. Maybe work on that before packing your bags and heading overseas? Like, find a job or a volunteer placement in your home country but away from your home region for a season maybe, something to foster your independence and problem solving skills. Otherwise you risk spending an awful lot of money just to become incredibly frustrated and distressed very, very far from home. 

Travel is a great teacher, sure, but it would be a shame to turn yourself off of it by jumping into a big, expensive experience before you have the basic skills necessary to cope with it."

I've never traveled in Japan myself so I'm not familiar with their set up, but the overwhelming majority of countries in the world do generally have an English language site that will cover their entrance requirements.

backpacking,ffh039m,t3_etjnto,1579919521.0,"I only have experience in South East Asia, so that's what I'll speak to. I've been to all 4 of the countries you list, they're all worth going to. All I'll say is that in Laos, transport suddenly becomes an issue again. There are no trains, and buses can be irregular. It is a gorgeous country which both deserves *and demands* a minimum of at least 2 weeks, if not 3, just to really see, like, anything outside the capital, particularly if you're doing nature tourism. 

If you're crossing from Northern Thailand (definitely do go of the beaten path in Thailand, people are so much nicer in areas where they're not suffering from Tourism Overload) through Laos into Northern Vietnam, then heading south (do stop at Hue, it's worth it) to Saigon and doubling back to Cambodia, I'd recommend taking a boat up the Mekong for your border crossing. Speed boats run from Chau Doc in Vietnam (which is an afternoon bus ride away from Can Tho, where many of the floating market tours take place) up to Phnom Penh. It is a breezy, relaxing, smooth voyage up the river and the border is one of the calmest I've ever seen because it's purely for boat traffic and therefore there's no crowds, no lines, no touts, nothing. It's just a nice way to spend a day and incorporate a relaxing boat ride into an administrative duty. 

That being said, the land crossing from Ha Tien, Vietnam (a cool little town with a bustling market)  into Cambodia will bring you by Kampot, a beautiful little town famous for its pepper, which was recognised as an ""appellation d'origine"" product in 2010. 

*Most importantly* though, double and triple check your visas and immunizations. I'd be particularly wary of what Japan requires in the way of immunizations from people who have visited India/South East Asia recently. Also be aware that if you're getting anti malarials, you'll likely have to bring more than one type as there are multiple different strains of malaria, and if memory serves, the one in South East Asia is now immune to at least one of the most popular/common drugs.

Have fun and good luck!"

My dude, I can't tell whether it was you or your wife that did the bad thing (you say you, but then why is your sister angry at your wife?), whether your brother is upset about you and your wife getting back together or you and your sister arguing. 

What (I think) I'm clear on, is that you want to know whether you should continue protesting the hostile way your sister is treating your wife. The answer is, of course, NTA. 

1) Even if your wife was the ""guilty"" party, your sister has no goddamn right to weigh in on your marriage in such a shitty, public, and divisive manner unless actual abuse was happening in which case there should be cops and not just soap-opera level dramatic escapades.

2) Any pretence your sister has of doing this ""because she loves you"" immediately goes out the window as soon as she continues to do it after you've asked her to stop and made it clear it's inappropriate. She's made *your* marriage about *her* feelings, and her actions make it clear that she no longer sees your desires, goals, opinions, or choices of being worthy of consideration or respect *on the subject of your own marriage*. Be very clear, this is not just a sign of disrespect towards your wife, it's a sign of disrespect towards you and your judgement - her own judgement apparently being so immaculately flawless that she knows better than you despite not actually being you or a party to your marriage. Amazing.

3) Your marriage is every bit as valid and valuable as your brother's marriage, or your parents' marriage, or anyone else's marriage. It is every bit as deserving of preservation and respect. Ask your brother what he would do if your sister started treating his wife in such a way. I don't mean be snarky - this might be a good opportunity to both legitimately ask for perspective on how to de-escalate the situation while also clarifying for your brother exactly what your sister has been doing and how toxic it is (the old ""what if it was your special person getting this treatment?"" card might be useful here).

4) That's *your wife*. By your account, she not only hasn't done anything wrong, she was actually the injured party in all this. She is not the one that started this situation with your sister. You are not the one that started this situation with your sister. Your sister chose, and is continuing to choose, to act disrespectfully towards someone *who has done nothing to her* - that is what a bully does, and you are always in the right when you stand up to a bully, but ESPECIALLY so when the person being bullied is your spouse.

You gave us just the barest outline of your situation, so it's more impossible than usual to really understand all the variables at play, but based on what I'm putting together from the scraps you've thrown to us, I'm comfortable in my NTA judgement. Good luck with, well, everything. 

If all else fails, and you truly trust your parents, it might be worth it to consider sitting down with your sister with your parents as mediators (audio record this meeting, I *urge* you - not as ""evidence"" but sometimes when we're upset we can anticipate a particular response from someone so strongly that that's what we hear even when it's not *exactly* what was said, and this way you don't have to second guess your emotionally stressed memory) and getting right down to the root of the problem with your sister. Why is she taking this out on your wife? Why is the grudge lasting all these years? What is she trying to accomplish at this point? Etc."
