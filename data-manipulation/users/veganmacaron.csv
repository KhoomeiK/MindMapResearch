There's a difference between being a stay at home mom and a tradwife. Tradwives believe that it's the only way to be happy as a woman and they actively encourage each other to endure abuse to keep the lifestyle functioning. 

There are unfeminist choices women can make. That doesn't always mean they are bad choices or morally wrong. But there are choices that don't advance women's liberation or actively reify partriarchal structures. I shave my legs because I'm embarrassed by my body hair. That's an unfeminist choice I'm making, and I don't respect myself for it. But I've weighed the social consequences and chosen to continue to do so. That doesn't mean I'm not a feminist, but it isn't a feminist choice. 

I do think less of women who buy into and believe rhetoric that they are less than men and are only capable of housekeeping and motherhood. They are selling themselves short and think my choices are selfish and deluded. They're allowed to do whatever, and I certainly won't stop them, but I think less of them and wouldn't probably ever befriend them."

progresspics,ffo3ji8,t1_ffnwbhe,1580073727.0,"I'm trying really hard to stop looking at food as entertainment or emotional regulation. I've been maintaining instead of losing since around november because of a stupid restrict/binge cycle I got caught up in, so I'm making some strategy changes, namely actually eating 1200 per day and not drinking so much so I'm actually full instead of starving all the time. It's how I lost the first 70 pounds, and as long as I actually get started, I can do that for months before I need a break.

I also noticed that the thing that made me the happiest and most excited was binge-eating and binge-drinking (ish bc i'm a lightweight) and binge-watching a show. How sad is it that I have no other sources of joy and positivity in my schedule?

So I'm focusing on getting dopamine from accomplishing tasks and being proud of my hard work. I'm learning the flute and working on writing a novel, while also in grad school. If I can spend 45 minutes to an hour per day on tasks that have actual pay-off, I might feel more satisfied in my life and not look to food to provide that sense of satisfaction. Grad school starts to feel like pushing a rock up a hill with no end in sight, so having actual pay-off in my hobbies and other passions is important.

I don't meal prep as much as I cook big batches of three meals or so per week while having lunch and breakfast options on hand. I'm 90% plant based, so I need to really strategize to get enough protein in my diet. This week we got a lot of dal (lentils) and chili cauliflower from a takeout place because it's pretty low fat and high protein, so that's been a godsend. 

I also made sauerkraut and vegan sausage soup, and I'm going to make white bean chili and more dal in the crockpot for this coming week. I live off veggie burgers on 35 calorie bread, and packets of spicy pickles, and cauliflower crackers for snacks."

It's like a kid who eats their whole Halloween candy stash in one weekend and is sad that their sibling has a mini candy bar at lunch every day for a few months.

You've been pushing back against the abuse, which is good. Now you need to enforce boundaries. If she says, ""My baby,"" and you correct her, and she says, ""Shut your mouth,"" take the baby and leave the room. Every single time. You can't let up even once.

Start recording with your phone that instant so you have proof, in both languages so the police understand the situation.

They have dysmorphia that extends to other bodies and are deathly afraid of their kids being fat because their kids' bodies are their bodies, too.

It can also mean that everyone else's bodies are a comment on their own in their mind. She needs to be the thinnest in her circle.

You can set clear boundaries. ""If you comment on my weight (or SO can say this), we will hang up/leave/not speak to you for a week. It is inappropriate and none of your business.""

You can demonstrate how it feels to force empathy, but that won't probably work as well. ""Wow, MIL. How much weight have you gained from menopause?

What you are looking for is probably a registered dietitian. 

Generally, the accepted medical advice is to not eat fewer than 1200 calories per day because that is the amount of food it takes to get all the nutrients you need along with macros and still lose some weight. There is conflicting research on macro breakdowns (fat, protein, carbs, etc.), but if you eat .5 grams of protein per pound of body weight, that's generally considered to be enough for the average person. 

My (not a doctor, not a dietitian) suggestion would be to calculate the TDEE for a sedentary person at your goal weight, and then increase your intake by 100 calories per week until you reach that TDEE intake. Then, you will very gradually drift to that goal weight and maintain. You will have practiced eating at that amount, and it will be an eating pattern you can sustain the rest of your life. 

Some people say you should stop counting calories forever to be ""truly recovered,"" but I think that counting calories and weighing daily/weekly might be a way for someone with an ED to manage their food anxieties while ensuring that they are a healthy weight and also not overshooting in recovery (which does sometimes happen if you follow the ""let go of control of food"" method of recover many doctors recommend)."
EDAnonymous,fdiuomr,t3_elhtot,1578451442.0,"The only way to begin to address this is to recognize the disordered thoughts, counter with the truth, and make the choice that is good for your health while repeating the truth to yourself.

Like remind yourself that you have to eat 3500 over your TDEE to gain a pound of fat. Your TDEE is at the very least 1000 sedentary, even if you are short and underweight. Anything under that won't cause weight gain. 

You can weigh out every gram of food and mathematically be certain you won't gain weight. Tell yourself over and over. ""I can mathematically prove this won't make me fat."" The other thoughts are your brain lying to you because it's caught in an anxiety loop. You have to break the loop. 

Then self-care through the resulting panic. 

It sucks really badly, but it's the only way this gets better. 

(Also, if you eat closer to 1000 and suddenly gain weight, remember it is glycogen, water, and food waste. Keto dieters lose 10 pounds their first week -- it's the water and glycogen in their muscles that gets flushed out as they enter ketosis. You might be in ketosis right now from restriction.)"

There were some rough patches, but almost 7 years later now, I'm happy, healthy, pursuing a good career, and loved. 

This will be the best decision you have ever made. 

If anything goes wrong, don't hesitate to call friends or police to make her let you leave."
