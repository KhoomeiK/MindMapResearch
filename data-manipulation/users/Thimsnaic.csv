SweatyPalms,ffhsipg,t3_etpkcl,1579951648.0,That is terrifying. I'm pretty sure I have a fear of large bodies of water. Forget the name for it
TalesFromTheCustomer,ffhq6fb,t3_etbg8j,1579948021.0,"I feel your frustration. My girlfriend has a stomach intolerance to onions and she has to put up with this shit all the time. Not only that but onions are in practically everything, but people just assume she doesn't like them, and half the time don't even listen when she asks for no onion."
HealthAnxiety,ffhozqt,t3_etduq7,1579946195.0,Thank you for sharing this I seriously needed it

Wreckfest,ff63s8t,t3_eru4nc,1579618413.0,Its a dlc you gotta buy it. But its super cheap and you get a few cars so it's worth it imo.
Anxiety,ff629o7,t1_ff5y6do,1579617309.0,"Well of course, it's great news :)"
Anxiety,ff4tukc,t3_ergzqz,1579572312.0,Congratulations! Hope it works goes well for you :)
NovaLauncher,ff351e5,t1_ff30akv,1579533844.0,I've had nova for like 2 years now and I still can't make setups half as good as that ahaha
NovaLauncher,ff300na,t3_ercwjz,1579529979.0,First setup? I'm impressed.
depression,ff2ltd9,t3_era8lw,1579512254.0,Too true. Yes other people do have it worse. But why should that invalidate your problems? Such a dismissive way of looking at it.
Wreckfest,feyw324,t3_eqxflu,1579451161.0,I wish they'd add nascar into the game officially :( I'd love to try it out but I'm on console
AnimalsBeingDerps,fey9h47,t3_eqaiw6,1579442508.0,That dog has better teeth than I do
AnimalsBeingDerps,fey8yxe,t1_fey8i8h,1579442294.0,I think that's just how cats roll. They like to judge humans ahaha

depression,femytvb,t1_fempk6l,1579273089.0,"Well that makes sense, maybe there is something underlying that I just don't know about. But I feel like its more than likely number two, simply because its not having an insanely negative effect on my life.

I'd rather stay off of medication if I can, I don't feel like my depression is severe enough to even warrant using medication."
depression,femoq4i,t1_femoe0d,1579264972.0,Thank you :)
depression,femoaas,t1_femo6ii,1579264537.0,"Yeah true, I suppose if it can randomly create good thoughts it can also randomly create bad ones. 

Yeah thankfully it's not too severe, I've gotten much better at dealing with it and opening up to people, which really helps."
HashiriyaDrifter,femf8n5,t1_fem9wmx,1579252402.0,This is photoshop?
Shitty_Car_Mods,femcp6r,t1_fembibk,1579248825.0,Decent!
Wreckfest,femcmcm,t3_epqg5z,1579248719.0,This would be awesome. I can only imagine what kind of crazy tracks people would come up with. I know theres probably mods and stuff but I'm on console and I can't afford to get a PC.
The_Crew,fejil2y,t1_fejiffk,1579175836.0,"Yeah maybe you're right, that would be a lot better. Snow in the desert just ruins any kind of immersion."
Wreckfest,fejhx6x,t1_fejhu1t,1579175023.0,"Ah okay thank you :) yeah I have yet to finish the career so that explains how I didn't know about this car.

Thanks for the advice as well, I'll be sure to give it a go :)"
The_Crew,fejhpiy,t1_fejh72u,1579174749.0,"I agree, I think there should be different weather systems depending on where you are on the map. (not sure how easy that would be to implement though)."
Sneakers,fejhmip,t3_ep92um,1579174643.0,"You got this man, we all believe in ya!"
Wreckfest,fejh6ce,t3_ephpme,1579174053.0,Possibly a stupid question but how did you get this car?

HashiriyaDrifter,fej7nok,t1_fei8zid,1579160348.0,Ohh right okay
HashiriyaDrifter,fehy55v,t1_fehxkxt,1579126211.0,Yeah? Are you on iOS because I'm on android and I don't see it anywhere.. Only the S15 with the livery
HashiriyaDrifter,fehy38r,t1_fehx8fd,1579126179.0,"Yeah, I suppose it is only the one guy so maybe he missed it"
HashiriyaDrifter,fehu7cp,t3_ep4yjo,1579123952.0,"Also, I'm getting this on Port, even though its a completely flat map"
HashiriyaDrifter,fehtp32,t1_fehtloy,1579123666.0,"CarX is fine, but I'm saying I think FR is more difficult than hashiriya"
help,feht6il,t3_ep6wqj,1579123376.0,"You have to start over again, but since you've only just created it, you should be fine :)"
Huawei,fehnxp2,t3_ep0gq0,1579120376.0,No problem
Huawei,fehntre,t1_feh1hxh,1579120314.0,P20 one is coming in March apparently
HashiriyaDrifter,fehjlhj,t1_feh7cnd,1579117869.0,"You can buy that car?? Also I agree, I'd even argue that FR Legends is a more difficult drifting game. But that could just be because I suck at it lol."
OtterBox,fehdsno,t3_ekxhfo,1579114479.0,I'm not certain but I think it's for either a Samsung Galaxy S8 or maybe an S7?
redditmobile,fegrdk9,t3_eosohw,1579100752.0,"I get this one all the time, it's kinda irritating."
NewToReddit,fe9irrx,t3_eo7g7a,1578937847.0,"Well karma doesn't mean a whole lot, it's like the reddit equivalent of likes if you will. So however many upvotes you have from posts or comments, is roughly how much karma you'll have (although it's not 1:1),downvotes take karma away, and they are basically the equivalent of dislikes.

So you shouldn't feel embarrassed or awkward about talking to someone with a load of karma, because chances are they don't really care if you have none, and they'll understand because your account is only new.

As far as subreddits go, just join communities about topics or hobbies or anything that interests you, if it's already a well established sub, that's even better in my opinion because you'll get more answers for any questions you have, as well as more support about topics because there's simply more people there to help you out.

Hope this helps, and I hope it makes sense hahaha"
