I gave that bastard my best years and my best body and I **STILL** felt like shit. I **WISH** I was that weight now, now I'm like 30 pounds heavier and I'm more self conscious than ever."

AskMen,ff9r46o,t1_ff9k58a,1579719219.0,right? I'm feeling like crap just reading all these comments about how these guys can just grab all over their girlfriends bellies and they don't care or seem to like it. I'm over here feeling self conscious just THINKING about my belly fat T\_T

AskMen,ff7506b,t3_erv3sy,1579641242.0,"my boyfriend and I really got into fishing this past summer. Now we're buying special hooks and poles and we've gone during the winter too to try and catch different kinds of fish. Plus, it gives us a good excuse to go camping or stay at a cabin for a week; if the place we pick has good fishing, it gives us something to do while we're out :)"
rant,ff6fybz,t3_eruel4,1579626352.0,"My parents got divorced when we were young. I was taking care of my younger brother when he was like 5 and I was 10 or so. Never really got to hang out with friends or do fun stuff during the week because mom worked so much. I guess it didn't really bother me growing up because my brother and I got along pretty well and we're both easy going, but looking back I wish I had had more of an opportunity to be a kid and make friends. 

Nowadays I'm the ""mom"" friend who's always worried about everyone, especially when we go drink or party. I have a hard time letting loose and just enjoying things because I'm so focused on making sure everyone is accounted for and safe. Guess that's not a bad trade off, but still I totally agree with the sentiment of this post."

Makes me feel like I did a really good job raising my boy, he's never been people aggressive and I count my blessing every day that I adopted this wonderful little boy."
