Going with Varitek would also be a choice that the players would be comfortable with and would be seamless going into spring training, which is very close. 

On the whole, the team probably has to be biased towards options from inside of the organization. The rest of the league will not be happy about them wanting to interview bench coaches and other staff this close to spring training, and there's not a whole lot of good will to bank on right now. 

Some of our other options from inside of the organization need to be avoided. Were our bench coach and first and third base coaches involved in the sign-stealing stuff? We don't know yet, and it would be pretty nasty to deal with another manager being suspended a few months into the season.
