I've been in treatment twice before and I didnt have a bad experience but I relapsed shortly after & have a hard time thinking of ever going again...especially with school but I cant finish school if I keep this up and I'm not here

nursing,fecuzgc,t1_fcez7y3,1578985676.0,just wanted to say this helped me so much
nursing,fecswd7,t1_fecs1xq,1578983342.0,"I do think I'm burnt out honestly but just because of my personal life being so chaotic but not to the point where I dont care about the patient at all. I havent had much experience with patients dying or being in an immense amount of pain but I definitely did/do feel hurt for them and their family when I know there time is limited or they're hurting and I cant do much about it. I just know that I can definently be high strung in the emotions department so what worries me more is me not controlling them and thus compromising their care emotionally or physically by not thinking straight. the thing that drives me to be kind to patients is wanting them to feel cared for and as comfortable as possible in a crappy situation which isnt something I ever see changing & why I'm on the edge of it just being a defense mechanism versus me being nuts. 

I definitely agree that I'd definitely benefit from talking this out with a therapist and will bring it up ASAP"

Nurse,fe9isja,t1_fe9gssk,1578937855.0,I wasnt offended by what you said at all and I appreciate the reality check for sure. I was just annoyed yesterday but definitely feel alot better about the situation now.
Nurse,fe97f01,t1_fe6xoy4,1578935043.0,Props to you for going through nursing school with a child and a full time job. that's amazing!
Nurse,fe95kdb,t1_fe942ur,1578934461.0, I definitely realize that as evident by the explanation in my post. I don't care about having to work weekends or holidays in the future. I am annoyed by it now. There is alot more incentive I'm being payed verses being in a clinical rotation using virtually no skills. In regards to my clinical instructor I do see & understand that as well but there is more of an issue with how the situation was handled and how I was spoken to especially without knowing the full story.

If you feel you are mentally and emotionally able to add to his case please do so. in regards to your family, shame on them. please reach out if you need anything as I know this can bring a world wind of pain, memories & emotions"
