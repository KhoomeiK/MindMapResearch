I have the same problem with starting projects or thinking about ideas but not giving them a deadline or just forgetting them at all 

For this year I decided to make a page for each topic.
A page for ideas, projects, goals etc but for me to look back at them is adding a tab (using a piece of washi tape and folding it over the page) at either the top or bottom so I can always go back them them or use ribbons // bookmarks to go back to them.

Sure a whole page may seem like a waste but in my opinion it’s better to have them all together so you can complete one without starting another and seeing you complete them over time gives you a little validation and motivation that oh can do it. 

Another column you might wanna do is rank them with priority (really want to finish this project = 3 stars // this would be nice to do eventually = 1 Star) 

Maybe do a start date and a finish date column? 

Sure it may take longer than you expected or planned.
 But just keep the Rome wasn’t built in a day mentality 

Sorry if it was too long, but good luck and hope things go well!"

well for the other moods, I just do a recap in my daily entries and then summarise the day with the mood that I had for majority of the day.

As for the double tracker, Iâ€™ve never really seen that before, maybe Iâ€™ll try it out for my next weeks spread â˜ºï¸"
