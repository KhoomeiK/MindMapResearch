CitiesSkylines,ffeufwm,t1_ffercma,1579866024.0,"Let me put things into perspective: 

When I play this game on my gaming laptop my i7 reaches temps like 90 degrees by boosting its clock speed up to 4.9 GHz just to handle a city over 50k.
The iPad AX10 CPU has a max clock rate of 2.38 GHz and there is no way of it having this stable speed because of thermal throttling. An iPad has zero cooling system.  

 With a couple of mods my 50k City is already requiring over 16GB of RAM while an iPad has (6GB?) of RAM max. 

Not to mention that also the GPU is put under stress and gets over 60 degrees easily. 

I mean you could play this game on an iPad but with huge limitations, you could reach a 2k village before the game starts lagging or freezing, or your iPad melting. I occasionally read posts here about people complaining that their $2000 gaming PC are having issues as well to run this game once their cities get big (over 200k-300k)."

SeriousConversation,femdgo4,t1_fel3ws9,1579249860.0,"Again, if you don’t need a better phone than 20 years ago the market still offers you $50 “Nokia style” phones. If your car was fine 20 years ago the market still offers a lot of old and cheap used cars you can buy. 

And again, if food, education and rent are rising faster than wages it’s mainly because of inflation, not necessarily because of corporate greed. Not to mention that also the quality of food has improved due to so many safety control checks, regulations, consumers protection, obligation for the factories to meet certain standards, reduce pollution etc. Same for the healthcare, due to medical advancement and technology progression more and more complex and expensive gadgets and more qualified personnel and doctors need to be paid to maintain nowadays standards to at least maintain the same (huge) margin profits they used to, although I don’t know what the actual profit margin of the private hospitals in the US is. 
And lastly rent is increasing due to more demand and overpopulation, sure the Earth is big but everyone wants a house in the city center or Miami coastline, but none wants a house in Siberia or in the middle of Arizona desert. You can find very cheap houses too, just not where you want. The market follows a lot of pricing rules that aren’t even remotely dictated simply by single humans or greedy landlords and CEOs. 

Economics is complicated and has tons of variables."

SeriousConversation,fekghnb,t3_epdxu9,1579199550.0,"This is a very common misconception or limited way of seeing the reality. Things don’t become more expensive because of corporate greed (that’s something that always existed since the birth of capitalism) but things get more expensive for two reasons mainly:

1) inflation, which in Europe is about 1-2% every year. Your wage should increase accordingly to maintain the same power purchase 

2) products/services have a better quality than ever before. People complain about how expensive cars are nowadays compared to 30/40 years ago. No shit, back then you were paying for a metal box with an engine and 4 wheels. Nowadays there are tons of safety and environmental standards every car must respect, accessories like radio, infotainment, Bluetooth, parking sensors, cameras, AC, automatic gearbox, start and stop technology etc. plus the legal obligation companies have to give customers at least X years of warranty etc. 
Same goes with the banks that you mentioned, now they offer online accounts, apps which you can pay everyone, everywhere around the world in any moment, customer service 24/7 etc. things that you couldn’t do back then (plus my bank is still free to this day). 

People only complain about how the prices increase but never realize how also the products/services quality has increased over the years. Nowadays you can buy a $50 phone that 20 years ago would have cost you $500."
