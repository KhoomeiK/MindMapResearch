ZeroWaste,ffxymp4,t1_ffxtpvg,1580334994.0,It runs water while the toilet is filling so it doesn’t work like that. Mostly would just be used for hand washing after flushing the toilet unless you just flush your toilet a bunch of times in a row for no reason while you brush your teeth. You’d brush your teeth in the normal sink as usual.

WhitePeopleTwitter,ffxpac6,t3_evrhcd,1580329732.0,"Maybe it’s because on top of their full time jobs, they generally have also run the household and do all the emotional labor.
