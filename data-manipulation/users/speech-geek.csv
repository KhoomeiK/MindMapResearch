Dodgers,ffospy7,t1_ffoquzk,1580081237.0,I’m in AZ and one of my favorite sports memories is being up at NAU for a college class literally just a few days after graduating high school. I had on the NBA finals and watched as we won in 2010 and hearing other people yell too.

phoenix,ffnh9ao,t1_ffm8opp,1580065951.0,I would kill for a Kinokuniya or Muji but we’re probably a while off from getting either.
fountainpens,ffngn2h,t1_ffngj36,1580065703.0,I’m personally eyeing the Gran Red or Prism Crystal!

fountainpens,ffiw8tv,t3_etun12,1579984219.0,My ink flow has been fine on the flex and fine nibs but I do have to use a bit more pressure to get the line variation for flex.

CozyPlaces,ffclmrz,t1_ffc106r,1579802077.0,The best part is the $1 section. Granted you need a couple of hours to get through it since it’s huge but you find some great finds there.
fountainpens,ff8vjox,t1_ff8tjm9,1579697533.0,They have the best price for one. I’ve been eyeing a M600 green stripe as my next “save up and buy” pen and CultPens is $100-150 cheaper than US stores (even with the foreign transaction fee).
phoenix,ff8va4p,t1_ff8tdf0,1579697284.0,Maybe a large Hydro Flask or Yeti? I have an 18oz one and it keeps the ice for hours. But I think the biggest one is the so-called “growler” size.

fountainpens,fewk8ia,t3_eqsg5y,1579412444.0,"Lamy has a bit of a reputation for having inconsistent nibs, especially on the lower end models. You can try for another one but might end up in the same boat. But you should know that they’ll never have any real feedback since they are a more broad Western nib compared to the Metro."
phoenix,feu6610,t1_fettw6e,1579383468.0,"I work at one of the major malls and I’ve had to call for cabs for plenty of people. The customer base is just old, disabled, or both."
phoenix,fespgbf,t1_fesji2t,1579367630.0,"While that is a valid argument, don’t forget that the taxi industry is much more powerful than they make out to be. If rideshares get pushed out they think that they can swoop in and recover the lost business and potentially raise their prices."

aww,feowrvg,t3_eq7jfi,1579307078.0,Hi Shane! I’ve been following you since the days when you were on Tumblr and going to college and discovered your YT channel a few weeks back. Hello :D
AskReddit,feoed3q,t3_eq1wzh,1579299017.0,To have my debt go away and to be in a different career.

Dodgers,fekrmsg,t1_fekkoiu,1579206176.0,It’s the Dodgers. They make a Sunday afternoon game in June against a last place Padres team feel like an elimination game.
Dodgers,fekei2e,t3_epn3b0,1579198366.0,"Good. Maybe this is what Manfred tried to accomplish: while he exchanged immunity for info, the ripple effect across the league was the real punishment. Now three teams (all three possible contenders next season) have to find managers with less than a month to pitchers and catchers.  

Edit: missed a letter"
baseball,fek46rb,t3_epketh,1579192240.0,"“But you know what - there will be a new day and eventually a new year. And when the upcoming winter gives way to spring, rest assured it will be time for Dodger baseball.” - Vin Scully"
baseball,fek3srb,t3_epctw3,1579192008.0,I was at that game. It started way past first pitch because of the speech and the Dodgers beat the Rockies. The giveaway that night was a beautiful letter that Vin wrote to the fans in an awesome blue envelope on nice card stock. It was quite a game to remember.
beagle,feit6y8,t1_feisoxb,1579146570.0,The coat is like a chocolate brown versus the normal black. They’re a rare variety of beagle but an accepted AKC color. You can get even rarer colors like blue tick or “silver” coats but those usually cost a lot of money for a puppy.
baseball,feh90vo,t3_ep3vpl,1579111651.0,"Yellow mustard, onion, and relish. Dodger Dogs are the best stadium hot dog."
beagle,feh2uty,t3_eogt49,1579107995.0,I have a chocolate beagle too! She has yellow eyes and a liver nose. I like to think of her as a Shiny Pokemon in real life.
fountainpens,fefd3dk,t1_fef6m67,1579053720.0,"No, I personally don’t think so. They might look similar to the untrained eye but some lean brown, others red, some blue. It seems like the common preferred “blackest black” inks are Noodler’s Heart of Darkness, Aurora Black and J. Herbin Perle Noir."
