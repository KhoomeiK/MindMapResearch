AFROTC,ffj2i7j,t3_etwzny,1579988747.0,"Listen, if it’s blatantly inappropriate report it. I don’t know if you mean a POC or cadre member but you won’t be retaliated against. At my det people report stuff all the time, even reporting their peers for instances of underage drinking and doing quizzes together. I wouldn’t think twice about reporting an instructor."

offmychest,ff4qvq7,t3_erll6w,1579570268.0,How dare you. It’s not my fault that everything other than German Death Reggae sounds like fart noises. Those other genres take 0 talent so I refuse to listen to them.

askwomenadvice,feizuge,t3_epegq1,1579151961.0,Well I got HPV my first semester. No one ever told me about the vaccine. So do that. If you live in the freshman dorms in a decent sized university it’s bound to happen (sex not STD’s). Well maybe STD’s
askwomenadvice,feiznwg,t3_epelov,1579151800.0,"I told my girlfriend it would be cool so I bought them and eventually she was willing to try them. She was very hesitant and wasn’t a big fan of the idea but she ended up loving them.

She had never masturbated before but after I got her to try them she started using them regularly on her own. 

Just get them for you, then ask him to use them on you. If he won’t then you either don’t use them or look for a more open minded partner."

relationship_advice,fdkhjjw,t3_elqwb6,1578504008.0,I broke up with my long time girlfriend and I didn’t ask her but she told me she almost slept with a few dudes and it tore me up inside. It’s not because I wanted her to be all hung up on me but because she felt the need to resort to that and that’s not who she is.
college,fdkahot,t3_elp3j5,1578499741.0,I try to avoid bad food and I immediately go to the gym after I get out of class or before I go to class. It’s pretty simple but I’ve also been going to the gym since high school so I never have to figure out what to do.

AFROTC,fcnv874,t3_ei4dup,1577819096.0,"I have a lot of experience with this one so I can tell you that if you are going to an out of state school, the in school scholarship is actually the better deal. It’s not very competitive as long as you are a tech major. All tech majors at my det got the scholarship. If you aren’t tech, it will be much more challenging. Just do well that first semester which should be very easy anyways."
