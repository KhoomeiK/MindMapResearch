Thank you for sharing your testimonial. Are you willing to disclose what was it that He told you to do, and how exactly did He tell you those things? Was it an audible voice? Through feelings? Through supernatural events, such as visions and dreams?"
Christianity,ffoq9df,t3_eu6y2p,1580080450.0,Thank you. I hope you are right.
NoFapChristians,ffopp8l,t3_eu8l9g,1580080258.0,Free forgiveness for everyone who asks for it?
gallbladders,ffoj1u2,t3_eudyba,1580078177.0,"Dizziness and low blood pressure don't really sound like symptoms related to biliary dyskinesia (because you had a HIDA scan I assumed that you don't have gallstones). You might want to see a cardiologist as well. Also, if you don't have gallstones, check for SIBO. Small intestinal bacteria overgrowth can be linked to gallbladder inflammation due to reasons that have yet to be studied by medical science."

TrueChristian,ffl721o,t1_ffl3p8l,1580035720.0,"I'm not sure I understand how bringing into captivity thoughts to the obedience of Christ is synonymous with giving the thoughts to Jesus. If anything, the phrase seems to suggest that we have to deal with the thoughts ourselves by bringing them into captivity, not to tell Christ to handle them.  


Also, praying while having obsessive-compulsive disorder and evil thoughts is a very difficult challenge."
