I do feel that even my part time job challenges my ability to work as much as I'd like to on my music - especially since I prefer to write in the morning.

She's 23 and so desperate to have a baby that she is ready to divorce you?

You didn't cause it. You can't control it. You can't cure it.

You are married to an alcoholic.

The thing about writing music is, after time, it starts to feel like all the other music you know - at least for me - a disconnect is created and I experience the song separate from the experience of writing the song. The lyrics take on new meanings just like any other song might."

fatlogic,ff8w0hy,t3_es9tum,1579697959.0,"I definitely have a mild fear of becoming fat again. It’s one of the things that keeps me from letting myself get fat again. Even the little bit of pounds that I put on last year was very noticeable in my life. I’ve felt slower, more tired, just generally less healthy for months. Now that I started dropping it, I instantly started feeling better.

That’s not, feeling better about myself because I’m thinner. It’s feeling better internally because my health is improving.

Nothing about this makes me afraid of or hate fat people."
