AskReddit,ffyfega,t3_evkh4n,1580345116.0,"Well one time I took an order to this girl and 6 guys. Probably aged about 19ish. The 6 guys were sitting behind her on the stairs with bongs in their hands. I forgot her drink on the counter of the store. I come back with the drink and the same girl answers the door. No guys to be scene. Then I notice it. There's lots of cum dripping off her face. 

Moral of the story. Please don't let 6 guys but on your face when expecting someone at the door soon."

PrequelMemes,ffg290p,t3_etb1kv,1579896888.0,"I did a similar thing at my old job at a food lion. We had gotten far to much bread one winter for fearing a snow storm. Ended up having tons left after the storm and so it was on sale. The timing accidentally coincided with another sale. Can't exactly remember the 2 sales but it turned out that for every 6-8 loaves you bought, you made 2 bucks. So I ended up filling my 2005 Chevy trailblazer with white bread. It smelled like bread for months, even after it had been gone. I made like 100 bucks from it. I ended up doing some fun sandwich nights with friends at my college where we made tons of grilled cheese for anyone who would come. Was called the bread man for a while. Gave away the rest of what I could. Fun times."

I guess you could call it lucky, I'm not well off at all and have a pretty fucked past and I didn't get any scholarships because I'm a white male, but I did get a pretty damn good deal. I pay 2200ish a year, and that's for a single room"

LinusTechTips,fdm0tz2,t1_fdlv1my,1578537123.0,"Thanks for the reply Anthony. It seriously means a lot to me to know that the LMG crew is here seeing the goings-on. Thanks for the great contributions at LMG. And congrats on the progress, however small, progress is progress. I'm a fair lot overweight myself due to very similar reasons. Some combination of genetics and mental health not being very good due in part to some trauma. I wish I could lose 20lbs, but I always fall back into the cycle of being sad because of my weight, and then eating to cheer myself (even if not knowing it while it's happening), and I'm sure you the nasty cycle here. Again, being congrats on that progress. I can't wait to see more from you and the others at LMG. Like how Alex has is engineering projects, you have Linux and very technical things, and I love when Tarren (sorry if misspelled, not exactly sure how to spell his name) does videos about editing and macros and his setup in general."

Minecraft,fdg9yv4,t3_el76v2,1578386467.0,"Also when I build I try to never go from one texture to another directly beside each other. Like by your doorway, the stone brick directly meets the wood. If you were do something like the windows above it where the stone brick is out closer to the player it adds depth and helps to separate the textures and make it look more realistic."

LinusTechTips,fdg8n7j,t1_fdg7oox,1578384700.0,"I don't think anyone here is trying to make excuses. But rather encouraging the weight loss they are noticing. We all know, including himself I'm sure, that losing weight would likely have a positive impact on his life. But I certainly dont know how he came to be so big, and I have a feeling most others don't know either. Maybe he has genuine health reasons that got him there, or maybe like a lot of people the weight slowly crept up until one day he suddenly noticed it. We all have different struggles. Slow progress is still progress.
 
Maybe I'm misreading your tone, but to me it seems that you have the same message as me and the others. Losing weight is a good idea, but the other guys said it in a way that was clearly supportive, you on the other hand seemed to be more insulting, rude, condescending or something of the sort, just not very supportive. Making it seem like he or others don't know that being overweight has its problems. We all know this fact.

Being supportive and complementing someone on their progress hurts nobody and can make that person's day. While being rude and insulting does no good, it doesn't make that person feel any better about themselves or their progress, and it certainly shouldn't make the one saying that stuff feel any better.

No intentions to be mean or hateful, just saying that we shouldn't judge someone by the point of their journey in life and should try to help and encourage them. And that any genuine reasons he may have for such a problem, like being overweight, shouldn't be seen as an excuse.

Edit: thanks for my first medal in my 2 years on here :)"
