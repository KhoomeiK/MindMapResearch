JustNoSO,ff9df4k,t3_es55rk,1579710570.0,"I am in a similar situation and I feel completely spent, worn out, and unappreciated. The last part of the worst. I work my ass off and it’s as if I also don’t work at all. I try and do little things for myself throughout the day to keep my sanity. I am hoping someday to be out of my situation but there are other factors that keep me here. Please try and find the small things to keep yourself sane. And whatever you do, do not for one second think you are worthless. Like me, you are the very thing keeping this sinking ship afloat. Remember also that it says a lot about your character and the kind of person you are. You are a lot stronger than you realize. Depression, suicidal ideation, I get it. Believe me I get it. The fact you are still working and holding on just shows how much of a badass you really are. Always, always remember that. Your ability to weather a storm such as this. I am rambling now and I’m sorry for that. I read your post and it struck so close to home. You will get through it as will I and we will be better and stronger for it."

abusiverelationships,fen1sgk,t3_eq0tys,1579275059.0,Yeah that’s definitely abusive. It may be questionable now but it will likely escalate into things that are unquestionably abuse. The sad part is you will slowly get used to the worsening things and almost be desensitized to the point where you will always ask yourself “is this abuse?” So from now on understand that anything that’s purposefully being done to make you feel bad either physically or emotionally is abuse.

addiction,fdqqau5,t3_emqv4g,1578672583.0,Also “no money for a therapist”. Fine. There are plenty of self help resources online. If you are serious about helping yourself you will. Don’t make excuses. Lots of times addicts make excuses like “oh man I tried but I couldn’t find/afford help”. We have the internet. You can help yourself if you’re serious.
addiction,fdqq5e1,t3_emqv4g,1578672486.0,"Like any addiction, you’ll probably need some more help like a therapist or a support group. This behavior is self destructive due to the dangers of casual sex with strangers. Don’t wait until you contract something to learn your lesson. Do it now and find a way to deal with WHY you are doing this. You are attempting to self medicate so to speak or fill a void. You need to find out why and address it so you can stop doing it."

TwoXChromosomes,fcpqtnq,t3_eidytw,1577870141.0,"Restraining orders can have a negative impact on the people they are served to so before going thru with it ask yourself if this person truly deserves this. He has a volatile/violent temper but never towards you in the 2 years you dated. In one month, he dropped your stuff off at your place with a small gift. I know you told him to throw it away but there are girls who would later turn around and say “I never said that, he just threw my stuff away” so I think returning it to you wasn’t necessarily unreasonable. The gift he included and the New Years text could be him trying to salvage something from a 2 year relationship. He may be upset/hurt you guys broke up. I think staying no contact is a must if you are 100% done with him. Don’t respond at all as that will give him hope. If he persists or becomes at all threatening then absolutely but at this point I believe it would only serve to cause him problems or cause you problems if it sends him over the edge."

JUSTNOMIL,fcnfa4a,t3_ei4n5e,1577810522.0,The important thing to remember is that none of this situation is her business. You could even say something like “look I really don’t want to discuss my breastfeeding anymore”.  Maybe she’s a little jealous of the closeness you 2 have and her lack of control over the situation.

If he can’t handle the different smells a sexual partner produces at different times, especially if the smells are reasonable, then fuck this guy. You deserve an adult. Start being brutally honest about his balls and how they smell after he’s worked all day without a shower. Let him know he’s no rose."

He may have already had plans with friends and he hasn’t decided on you enough to include you. I think to tell him you’ll miss him on New Years and wish to see him isn’t bad either.

Others have done it and they were no better than you. Forget about tour family and that car. They are not what makes you want to get high. You want to get high because it feels good. I understand this. It fucking feels good. Admit it. And then recognize and realize that you cannot use this to get by in life and be ok. We cannot high our way thru life because it wrecks everything.

sex,fcheusl,t3_ehaf9c,1577649841.0,I think you are the best thing he has ever had. So much so he busts the second he gets in there and this wounds his masculinity. It has nothing to do with compatibility and everything to do with his ego. He can impress “trash”but you’re not trash and in his head he knows he’s not good enough for you. It’s easier for him to blame compatibility and run than it is for him to admit he is in awe of you.

bipolar2,fch5z61,t3_eha4tx,1577647605.0,Suicidal thoughts are a constant of bipolar 2 I believe. I am constantly plagued with them and I always have to dissect them and make sense of it. I normally feel them acutely when perfect storms of guilt and failure align and I end up feeling “I should just end this”. If I am honest with myself and allow myself to feel the despair that goes along with it while telling myself it will pass it helps. I know I will never be completely free of suicidal thoughts but I know I can work thru them and come out on the other side of them. Don’t beat yourself up about having these thoughts. It’s all part of having BP2 in my opinion. Learn to work thru* them rather than wish them away.

confession,fcgs0oc,t3_eh908l,1577643502.0,I think this is something that needs outside intervention such as a therapist. If it’s true you fell asleep in a high state and did something like this and don’t remember it I truly feel terrible for you. Please understand it’s going to be a hard sell convincing people you don’t remember doing it and that you have no urges to do this normally. Lots of people are not going to believe that and that will be the worst part. It’s terrible when we make true mistakes that go against our normal intentions and who we are as people. Quitting smoking weed is a good first step. Not that weed is bad per se but it’s not good in your current living situation. Also it will demonstrate your willingness to correct this by taking a contributing factor away. By reading this I truly believe you when you say you didn’t mean to do this and I am just sorry that it’s happened. Things will be bad initially. Your family will have to come to terms with it. Having a long honest talk with your sister when the time is right will help too. Right now it may be too soon as she herself is probably freaked out too. Your parents love you and they are going to continue to love you. As a parent I would be beside myself if this happened but I would ultimately fight to make sure my family got the help they needed. Please don’t kill yourself and don’t let this be a thing that takes you down a dark road of endless guilt your whole life.
