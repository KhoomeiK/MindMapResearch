BrokeHobbies,ffc67av,t3_esuf3r,1579792471.0,I love melting crayons. They are so cheap! You can get a giant box of crayolas for like 6$ as walmart. All my paint is from high school so I only spent money on the canvas board. Way cheaper than stretched canvas.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffc5et5,t1_ffc4r73,1579791937.0,Thank you so much!
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffc4c39,t1_ffc44pm,1579791210.0,I was offered my old position back. The lady they replaced me with is not cutting the mustard and they want me back! I loved my old job so this is really really exciting for me.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffc46dz,t3_esp88u,1579791101.0,This is the third thing. It didnt happen to me but to my little brother. He was really little probably 3 or 4. We were in a store and he grabbed a magnet that made noise. I think it was a cow. He wanted my mom to buy it for him but ended up putting it in his pocket. We discovered it when we got home and my mom explained what shoplifting was. He was so scarred and cried for so long. We still make fun of him for it.

The hardest thing in my life was my parents divorce. It was nasty. My mom left my dad and he never really got over it. He spent the next 10 years trying to break my mother financially and psychologically. He turned my brothers against my mom so they stopped visiting her. He tried to bribe us with expensive things like cars and other things. Luckily, I am almost 30 now and I feel like things have finally settled down. I learned a lot from the experience and I hope to be able to raise my kids in a loving home not one dominated by a divorce. Thank you for the great contest."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffc3cup,t3_essa3k,1579790526.0,Good morning!! I am doing research on this job that I have been unofficially offered. I was a teacher and took a break to work on my mental health. My mental health is back to tip top shape. I am very seriously considering taking this job even tough its an hour commute one way. Thank you all for your help yesterday in helping me decide!
SeriousConversations,ffc20jx,t1_ffc07os,1579789542.0,That is one option yes. Even though its an hour away. I am leaning toward taking the job for a number of reasons. I think the positives outweigh the negatives.

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ff98tar,t1_ff97wjl,1579707492.0,Its a really tough choice. I know I would be happier there but am I giving up too much to achieve happiness. UHGGG So difficult. Thank you for helping me work this out.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ff96g55,t1_ff96bku,1579705958.0,Thats what my dad says. But I am so unhappy here. My other option is to pass on this position and hope something better comes my way. but Then I am afraid I will be stuck here for another year. Thanks for helping me sort this out!
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ff96agz,t1_ff9675u,1579705853.0,Thank you! that goes into the Pro column. I am working for a university right now but I am not doing teaching stuff. I totally agree with you.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ff95k40,t3_esba72,1579705357.0,"Hello and good morning friends. I am in a bit of a pickle... maybe you can help me out? I used to teach kids and took a break for my mental health. I got new meds and my mental health is back to tip top shape. I want to go back to teaching but last year I got no interviews. Yesterday my old principal called me and offered me my old job back. Cons: Its an hour drive one way, I will be taking a large pay cut, I will be going back to work in a tough district with tough kids. Pros: I love teaching and I would be pretty comfortable going back to a job I know."
