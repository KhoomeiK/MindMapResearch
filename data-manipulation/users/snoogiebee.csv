trashy,ffzm4ye,t3_evxmvs,1580385562.0,"my ex works nights and I work days. we both wanted as close to a 50/50 custody arrangement as was possible given our schedules - of course I ended up with slightly more physical time as my daughter needs to stay most nights with me. but the point is we based our financial agreement on the spirit of 50/50 custody and the JUDGE was trying to convince me that I should be holding out for more. I’m fortunate that my ex is a great dad and is free with his time and money with our daughter, but I couldn’t believe how hard the system actually TRIED to create tension between us. brutal"
