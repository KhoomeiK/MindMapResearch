Similar to how knowing different martial arts can make you a better fighter, knowing how to avoid a fight entirely can ensure you never lose one.

Same basic principle as the “many tools in the tool box” from earlier.

aikido,febh9dk,t3_eobvvl,1578958767.0,"All martial arts are designed for a specific set of conditions.  Boxing, for example, generally assumes only 1 opponent, on level ground, where you know the fight’s started, and you have some measure of hand protection or don’t mind the risk of injury.  And that’s not to mock boxing, those conditions come up pretty reliably, and punching is useful to know.  Wing Chun is built for very close-in fighting where you don’t have much room to move around, and it’s good at that.

Aikido, on the other hand, focuses on the first 5-or-so seconds of a fight where you don’t know for sure if a fight has actually started.  I can easily get someone to let go of my shirt by jabbing him in the eyes or punching his lights out, but in a modern environment that’s not gonna look good when the police ask bystanders what happened.  If you can subdue your attacker with minimal injury and without throwing the first punch, it is not only good for your attacker but good for you as well.  Its goal is to end the fight before it really begins.  It’s harder to explain “I was defending myself” when the other guy has a broken nose and cracked rib.

Now, that said, I do believe that Aikido could use some actual sparring practice if for no other reason than to get practitioners used to the adrenaline surge of a fight, when you forget 90% of what you think you know.  (If your partner is only falling because it’s expected, rather than because you made them, then I’d suggest finding a new partner). I think of Aikido as a Supplemental Art, to give you options for social situations.  (Can’t hurt to take a Boxing class just to improve your atemi) It’s a good tool to have in the toolbox, but I don’t feel comfortable with it being the ONLY tool.  

If you DO choose to have it be your only tool, that’s fine, but then you must practice it so much it becomes how you flinch.  Don’t rely on only 3-5 classes a week, practice 3-5 times a day (morning, lunch, evening).  Do Aikido so much that you move that way without even realizing it.  If all you have is a hammer, make sure that “thou art worthy” to wield it."

science,fdw82na,t1_fdvogm9,1578756009.0,"My objection is twofold:

* Given that so many people have advocated “communism” only to turn around and create dictatorships, regardless of the validity of their terms, what assurance does anyone have that YOUR particular definition and those espousing it aren’t doing a similar bit of nomenclature fiddling?  If a man came to invent a panacea derived from snake oil, and sold his product as such, you would expect him be able to demonstrate something tangible before you bought a bottle if for no other reason than there being so many other snake oil charlatans in the past.

* In any sufficiently large system, bureaucracy and consolidation of power is necessary to get anything done.  You need someone to make the calls on the scale of nations, even if it’s the matter of what to vote for or how to implement the decision that was voted on.  This is why Congress is so slow, it has a lot more people running it than the Executive branch does, and even then it’s nowhere near a million different representatives.  However, without a means to separate the working class into different groups and independent power structures (such as companies), the TOTAL number of power structures in the system becomes reduced, thereby consolidating power to a greater degree on a national scale than it would have been otherwise.  If everything belongs to the people, then whoever represents the people owns everything.  This is why I believe it can work on smaller scales but falls apart on larger ones: the very attempts to break up power end up just consolidating it further than before."

Enemy bad, us good, how can we be bad if X is so much worse, every negative example of us is an exception while every negative example of them is further proof, etc.  

Just take “the jews” and replace it with “the rich” or “illegal immigrants” or any hated group of your choice and you’ll have a LOT of the same talking points expressed here on reddit and in modern politics.

How would they frame their new stances, and can you make it sound like something they would actually say?  For example, how would the Republicans argue for more gun control, or the Democrats argue against abortion, if the other party already held the opposite view?  What accusations would fly?

With the right framing, you can easily get people supporting genocide.  We’ve seen it happen with Thanos.  You just need to make it “about” something else to appease people’s conscious and confuse discussion, choose a group you can blame that people already either dislike or consider inferior whether they admit it or not, and accuse detractors of either not providing a solution to the problem you’ve magnified or of actually wanting to make things worse.
