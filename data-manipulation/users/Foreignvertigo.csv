TwoXChromosomes,felvsx0,t1_fekxxxn,1579232183.0,"Ultimately, it's different for every person.  TBH I'm not sure if my SO would go back and do it again if given the chance, or if they would pursue a different path.  Consider if you will give up everything else you love in life in order to pursue academia. 

I'm happy to talk more over PM if you are interested."
TwoXChromosomes,feku64s,t1_fekpeep,1579207670.0,"My SO just finished his PhD. In the eight years he took for masters+PhD, I think he can count on one hand the number of books he read for fun/enjoyment. There just isn't time."
Fantasy,fdnu4pu,t1_fdn6p0e,1578592877.0,"I feel like I can really connect to your experience. In my teens I would have described myself as a hardcore fantasy reader but I really struggled to find books that appealed to me. Once I hit my mid twenties I basically... stopped reading. Every once and a while I would pick up a book, get halfway through, and quit. 

I finally started reading again when I started volunteering at a local library and had time to comb through the hundreds, maybe thousands, of male authored-and-centric books to find things I enjoyed. Please note, I volunteered for five years and my primary function was to locate and remove books that were not circulating.... I'm sure you can see where this is going."
