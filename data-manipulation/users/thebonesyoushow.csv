You said it’s about your sexuality and you said you want a vagina capable of giving birth so stick to a story? What am I getting wrong? you think vaginas are gross and you don’t want one but you do want one that could give birth but you don’t want a kid and you don’t want a dick but you’re keeping yours?? 
Which part of that was wrong?"
GenderCritical,ffm35tt,t3_eu1r9k,1580047697.0,I think it’s sad they think the medical community cares about them instead of realizing they’re a money maker and it’s easier to avoid a lawsuit to give people what they want

GCdebatesQT,ffm2758,t1_ffly0m4,1580047284.0,"You are not an infertile woman. You’ve never had a uterus or struggled to get pregnant? You can’t relate to that experience since it’s never even been a possibility for you.

What is this rambling about? If you identity as a woman why would you think vaginas are just a sexuality object that have nothing to do with being a woman? So you’re saying you’re keeping your male sexuality but think you can be a woman as well, that makes no sense. Who fed you that lie the men over in your trans subs? If women don’t matter to you and reality of womanhood doesn’t matter what do you even identify with? My vagina isn’t an object of my sexuality it’s part of my body. 

**dont mansplain women’s bodies**

Women would not want a penis attached to them. Women don’t think their own anatomy is gross. 

Why would you want one that can give birth if you don’t want kids and you think vaginas are gross? That makes it worse! 

You being defensive about it being a fetish is a huge red flag. You want to be a woman with a dick that sounds like a fetish. I’m sure if you were honest you’ve probably had a boner from some mundane experience. It’s common. What you consider a fetish and what we consider a fetish is different. I’ve seen the validity hell hole that is the mtf subs."

Bella is supposed to be relatable and mature for her age and she lives in a cold rainy state so she dresses in jeans and long sleeve shirts. What else would she wear???

She’s not wearing trendy stuff that would look stupid in hindsight she’s wearing things that don’t age, timelessness is a theme of the series. She’s being raised by a single dad. It’s practical and realistic. She’s literally wearing a pair of jeans and a henley? What should she be wearing? 

If you think her outfits are bland I’m wondering what you think a teenage girl in high school should dress like? Yikes.

This is what teenage girls wore when these movies were popular. She’s probably better dressed than you were in high school."
GCdebatesQT,fflw4bq,t1_ffjg5n2,1580044928.0,"What do you think vaginas/vulvas  look like when they’re being stretched open to birth a baby? You think they’re gross and yet you want to give birth? You’ve never even had period cramps how would you survive labor. You’ve no experience having a female body so why would you think you’d want that? Do you know what an episiotomy is? You can rip naturally but if not they’ll just cut you. You might want to research this with google because if you think vaginas are gross you’re going to really lose it when you learn about child birth. There is blood and amnio fluid and shit involved. I do hear that pushing a human out of your body is pretty universally female, women around the world do it, which is probably the only reason you want to do it. 

Not that hard to use a search engine to figure out you can’t have a baby with just a vagina ya dummy you’d need our entire reproductive system. If this was about being a parent and not your own need for endless validation you’d adopt. You’re a strange one. 

Why is it men want to give birth to feel female but they never say anything about motherhood or wanting to be a parent? Really concerning and makes me glad you’ll never be pregnant. Babies are not validation factories."
GenderCritical,ff5pk4w,t3_errbap,1579604853.0,"It’s like maybe your dad is gay or has a fetish and somehow that equals to being a woman? Like why is it always weird shit like dominatrix stuff? Why isn’t it like a man transitions and take up cooking or knitting or hair dressing, something stereotypically female and not sexual?

No one wants to transition to just be an average woman it’s always got a huge element of fetish.  

I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, thanks for sharing. I can only imagine how I’d feel if it was my dad."

I never understood why you’d shoot an animal instead of giving it away/bringing it to a shelter/or even just letting it go 

How can you allow your cat to be so skinny or leave it outside for THE WHOLE WEEKEND some people truly don’t deserve animals."

itsafetish,ff52rty,t3_ercwu4,1579578655.0,"It is astounding to me how much these men want to be called mothers without doing literally any of the work or having any kind of relationship with their child that isn’t centered on them. 

I mean yes there’s shitty moms out there and moms aren’t automatically better parents but when it comes to mothers and daughters I think MOST moms who aren’t a narcissist would never behave in such a way and he does it and is confused? 

So much for being the parent by putting the needs of your child ahead of what superficially benefits you 

And changing in the same dressing room? WHAT TEENAGE GIRL WOULD EVER FEEL COMFORTABLE CHANGING IN THE PRESENCE OF HER FATHER or being made to watch your father put on women’s underwear? As if that’s not a massive violation of boundaries and privacy. That poor girl her dad is an asshole!"
