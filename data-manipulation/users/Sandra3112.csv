CELTAcourse,ffc0g97,t3_esal79,1579788357.0,"It is believed that the celta course is one of the best teaching course a novice or experienced teacher can do. The problem is, most celta takers don't implement the teaching skills and techniques they learned in the course. The celta standards are quite high and require a lot of patience and perseverance to be used in class. More than that, it's a bit hard to use what you have learnt in the celta course with students in the public sector as they lack motivation and maybe are placed in the wrong level.
To be continued"
