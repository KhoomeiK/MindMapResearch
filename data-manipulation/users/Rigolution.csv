amateur_boxing,ff9a0k2,t3_esd0hu,1579708248.0,"I started boxing at 15 while I was getting some light but consistent bullying and a lot of being excluded. Between boxing and ironically gaming I got to college as a much more confident person or a least one capable of becoming confident. Years later and boxing the whole time I'm pretty happy with myself even if not actually happy but the confidence to speak my mind, stand up for myself or stay silent by choice are because of boxing. I've never had to defend myself from anyone but knowing that you're capable of doing so goes a long way to make turning the other cheek or standing up for yourself more palatable. If you can assert yourself in a ring, doing it verbally will be easy in comparison.

Boxing was by far the more important of the two for interacting with others and has been a huge benefit for me that I've pretty much been aware of from the beginning.

It makes for great fights and the utter lack of anything resembling that from Mayweather is a big criticism of him and McGregor is right, he was so shit that Mayweather adopted that style without any risk of losing or being hurt.

Bullshit, pure unadulterated bullshit. Why do so many people talk about things they know nothing about?

There are so many small organic farms in Ireland, organic farmer's markets (usually an organic stall in a larger market) are huge draws and they sell a lot to high end chains too. I worked for one for 4 years, it expanded significantly in that time both in terms of acreage and customers/sales. As a total of Irish farming they're pretty small but they're undoubtedly successful.

They had a lot of connections to other small organic farms through family and workshops and such. It was the furthest thing from impossible. This isn't to say farm work is easy because it never is but small scale organic farms are thriving."

AskHistorians,fegjr5g,t1_feghogx,1579094884.0,"This is the only right answer. What OP could do is read other sources and ask for particular points to be elaborated here. 

Not only is it almost impossible to summarize but with topics like this it's hard to write a comment that people agree with the language used. The one above for example calls the IRA terrorists and then names a couple of loyalist paramilitaries and calls them criminal organisations except loyalist paramilitaries killed more civilians than republican paramilitaries so why the difference? It's probably innocuous but if you reduce complex events to short comments then every word gets analysed and people are inevitably unhappy with an answer.

The Troubles in particular is pretty close to breaking the 20 year rule since The Belfast/Good Friday Agreement is very relevant to current Brexit issues and some of the paramilitaries involved never went away."
