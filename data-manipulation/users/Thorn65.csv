TrueOffMyChest,ffymb6i,t3_evxikj,1580349818.0,"Hey, can you go walk into your doctor's surgery tomorrow morning and tell the receptionist that you need urgent appt as you're feeling dangerously low and suicidal.  Let the doctor support you and I beg you not to act on how you're feeling right now. 
It does sound like life has been horrible but with ongoing support you can change your life.  First, you need to reach out to a professional.  Your education may not have been successful because of trauma in your life, it can effect concentration and learning, so don't write yourself off as failing in that area of your life. 
I returned to education in my late 30's and I shocked myself by finally succeeding.  It's never too late at any time.  

Hey and forget that girl, as hard as it may feel right now there will be many more sweet girls in the future.  
You're obviously hurting a lot emotionally but please know this is not the end. 

The good thing about being in any job is that it makes you 4 times more likely to get another.  Keep checking for other jobs.  Look online always for cv's tailored to jobs you're applying for and you'll get lots of advice.  You may not realise the skillset you have already but look at job skills online and start making notes of them.  Use them to promote yourself to others when in interviews etc.

Head up again because when it's down you can't see the opportunities that are often in front of you.  

Use word of mouth too to ask if others know of jobs going elsewhere.  

Little changes now can be the start of big changes.  You are stuck right now but with the right support you will move forward in ways that will benefit you. Never give up."
