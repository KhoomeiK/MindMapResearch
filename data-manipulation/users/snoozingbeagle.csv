He lived with two girls he raised from a previous marriage (not biologically his kids) and they only had a couch and one bed in their house. My friend and I would joke about how it was strange and always wondered where the two slept. Next to their bed was always a decent camera. One day we were over there and he said how the oldest was an am-playboy model, and that she sold signed cards of her pics. Definitely strange. He asked if we wanted any and we politely declined. He then went on to say how HE was the person who took her photos for her.... we never looked at him the same."

AskReddit,fepoigi,t3_eqcjg3,1579326119.0,"I had an incredibly vivid dream that me and for some reason kids from my high school, my younger step brother, and an incredibly hot girl (that I can’t remember what her face looked like, but I know had red hair) were flying on a plane. I said as we were taking off “this flight is inconvenient because we’re going to the theater right there” to my step brother. The theater was no more than a mile away. After I said that the pilot or someone near the cockpit came out with an uzi and started shooting everyone ; the plane then crashed in a river by the theater. I could feel my stomach lifting as the plane crashed. I swam through the water to the theater to see if my stepbrother went there since that’s where we were going and he was there with a random crowd of people. We casually talked about how we had just crashed and were suddenly passing around a blunt and drinking beers. Someone said something about the FBI counting heads from the plane. It suddenly got pretty suspenseful and I noticed a couple of cops shining lights while looking at everyone individually through the crowd making sure they found people from the crash. I remember then being caught and tied up but there were a crowd of people surrounding the cops and yelling at them while I was cussing them out. I remember then somehow getting out from the rope and escaping up a latter and helping (I shit you not) Whitney Cummings up it. Then it got foggy to the point where I remember that I was hiding out with a girl I liked from high school, but I don’t exactly remember that it was her face or a bunch of women I’m attracted to. Weirdly like it’s a blurred face but I know exactly who it was but not at the same time. Then for whatever reason my step brother was there too and he was hitting on her and it was like the mystery girl and I had already been together for years suddenly. I woke up a lot throughout this dream and I’ve tried recalling the most vivid parts of it. There’s a lot of like fighting random stuff like gang wars and I also remember during the part at the theater that my brother handed me a gun and I struggled to put in in my waistband because is war like a stock less ar15 but when I was captured and search it wasn’t there.
I recently quit smoking for a month and this is how ridiculous and vivid my dreams have become. I’d like to know yours too.
