educationalgifs,fc9zxlq,t1_fc8nn1r,1577560729.0,"5 minutes from the time the call to 911 is made and the tones drop. .

So, someone smells smoke in their house and calls 911 at 8:00, we are there typically on scene around 8:05.  We are supposed to take less than 90 seconds to bunk Out and get going. So, In a typical one story residential structure of about 2000 square feet, we can get water on the fire as quick as a couple minutes after we arrive on scene. So 5 minutes from call to water on fire is what our target is. 

This doesn’t always happen and factors like size of structure and time of day will affect response times. Takes us longer to get there at 1am than if call comes In at 1pm, for example. 

We are all firefighters and paramedics and rotate between the shifts on fire apparatus and rescue trucks. We have multiple engines and rescues staffed at each station, so it’s rare that we wouldn’t have available crews for a fire at the nearest station."

Bunker gear is meant to keep radiated heat off the wearer, not flame. And not steam or water. There is no special layer to keep boiling steam out of the suit. And therefore there is nothing to keep it off the wearer. It’s not water proof or water resistant in any way. 

It’s no different than putting on several layers of clothing and walking into a steam room or a sauna. You’re gonna get wet. Well, if that sauna were boiling... you’re gonna get burned.
