I feel for him...well, little. He may be wrong and an asshole, but EMS is overrun with bullshit calls. Probably 80% of the stuff I used to deal with could have been handled at the walk-in. Most of the rest would be have been fine in a personal vehicle or an Uber.

Not only that, but EMT school is one semester. 3 months. Paramedic is a year on top of that. EMTs generally have no idea how quickly something like a GI bleed can go from asymptomatic to full-blown shock. And then you go out to deal with being abused by everyone from your patients to the cops to your supervisors to the ER nurses for 10-20 bucks an hour.

The pay, education, and working conditions mean that EMS in America is far from being run by the best and brightest and actively selects against the best people for the job. Most, especially the overabundance of right-wing douchebags, turn jaded very quickly.

And I'm not directing this at you, (assuming you work at a nursing home or ALF) but if anyone hires people who are dumber and lazier than the average EMT, it's nursing homes. I can't even begin to tell you how fucking useless the staff at the shitty homes that take medicaid patients are.

""what can you tell me about him"" 

""oh, I don't know, I just got on shift/he's not my usual patient/he just needs to go to the hospital, OK?!"" 

Every. Single. Time. 

Or they'll be doing CPR on some old man who's *yelling at them to stop* or, worse, will call for a cardiac arrest, yet are standing in the hall outside his room when we get there. Great, now we get to pump on a dead guy's chest for 20 minutes before inevitably calling it.

Or they'll call 91 fucking 1 for something like ""abnormal labs"" instead of calling the non-emergency line to schedule a transport, meaning we have to put off real calls (jk) to risk our lives (slightly jk) driving lights and sirens because grandma's blood work from 3 days ago is slightly off. 

Or they'll literally just call for a problem patient because it's late and they don't want to deal with it anymore. 

Again, don't want you to think I'm calling you out. There *are* some good staff at some (i.e. expensive) homes. But they're few and far between. And there are lots of shitty EMS providers, as well. And screaming on-scene like that is wildly inappropriate and unprofessional (Jesus, just take the call and complain to your supervisor afterward if you genuinely think a facility is abusing your services). But I can sorta-kinda understand why he was so quick to jump the gun and get angry.

Next time an EMT (not a paramedic) tries that for something that's legitimately serious, just tell him that his education (read: lack thereof) makes him wildly unqualified to make that sort of decision. Because he is. Then complain to the company."

Do you know why it isn't now? Because Republicans are giving the working class' earnings to the executives. Because of 40 years of trickle-down Reaganomic bullshit, the average worker makes *less* than he used to, accounting for inflation. The average executive makes *four or five times* what he used to. 

> This whole idea that people on minimum wage jobs should somehow be paid as much as someone who went to school and got a needed degree is bullshit.
