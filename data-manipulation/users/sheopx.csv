confessions,ffet942,t3_et2tvb,1579864457.0,"Don't blame you mate. Some teens tried to break into my apartment, and all that was going through my head was 'they better not come in here and hurt my rabbit'. I heard them go for the lock, saw red and I was up at the door with a bat within seconds (I'm an average sized female, there was around six 17 year old guys).

Didn't occur to me for one second about me getting hurt, or them robbing my stuff, all I could worry about was my little bunny and how I couldn't bear for him to get hurt. Poor little guy was so spooked by the whole incident, he was super clingy for days. 

They're our family. They're helpless, innocent beings and they are worth defending."

entitledparents,ff6j7vj,t1_ff6j0jd,1579628360.0,"I said in another comment, the issue with it wasn't that *most* 7 year olds couldn't be alone (I must admit, I'm clueless about the subject), but it seems that this particular 7 year old had no sense of stranger danger and very likely lacked road sense. I feel if we're looking at a case by case basis, there is no fucking way she should've been left out alone."
entitledparents,ff6c97p,t1_ff6b3j3,1579624044.0,"Thanks. I really believe the majority of people have a great deal of compassion for the vulnerable. I know the young'ns in my family are extremely patient and kind with the elderly and the very young. 

It must be scary for you to have a little one with such a unique outlook on the world, especially one that potentially makes her more vulnerable than others, but rest assured that *most* people would treat her with care if she was in need."

At my work (Airport), I often come across lost kids crying for Mum and am absolutely terrified to approach them for fear of getting screamed at again. I tend to just call security or the police these days instead of engage with them or their insane parents.

And no she didn't call the Police, she just walked off in a huff, giving the poor little girl a right earful."

AskReddit,feyprwn,t1_feyh2jw,1579448921.0,"Reminds me of when me and my Dad (both dark haired celts) boarded a coach in Ireland from the airport. We sat down and were chatting, then my Dad all of sudden looked very concerned and said 'do you notice anything? Look around'. I realised that the (roughly) 30 other people on this bus all had ginger hair, ranging from strawberry blonde to fiery red. 

It's probably not a glitch, and was more to do with Irish genetics, but it was funny and quite shocking having just stepped off the plane from England."

AskReddit,feykm0w,t1_fev783p,1579446834.0,"Kind of reminds me of a rescue cat, Milly, my family had when I was a teenager. Milly had a hard life before us and had some brain damage, so needed constant 'babying', including being supervised when playing outside. 

One day I was watching her play, and she came to sit on the arm of the bench next to me and sun herself for a while. It started to go dark, so I called Milly to follow me inside, and as she stood up I saw this little metal thing that she had been sat on. I had a closer look, and it was a little silver angel charm. I thought it should belong to her as she had found it, so fastened it to her collar.

That angel was with her on her collar until she passed last year. A while after she passed, my Mum wanted to adopt another cat and was going through the old RSPCA files from her previous rescues, when she came across Milly's file. It had all her details, markings, DOB, health conditions, and her previous name on the top of the page, 'Angel'.

The reason it's so weird is that the angel charm that Milly had seemingly fabricated out of nowhere when I had found it. It didn't belong to me or anyone we knew, and was found, under Milly, in our securely enclosed back garden.

Milly also had a particular hatred for Buddha, seeking out my Mum's statues of him and throwing up on them, decapitating them, throwing them down the stairs and shattering them, but that's another story.

Edit: A picture of the young lady in question, with said angel charm on her collar. Apologise for the quality, it was circa 2010 https://www.reddit.com/user/sheopx/comments/eqxh2g/milly/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"

Probably in this situation, that poor little roo is so distressed and confused that he's willing to approach something (a human) that he usually sees as harmless/uninteresting."

They then will either try to control you to continue massaging their ego, or dump you in a careless way.

This by no means is a reflection of all, or even a lot of Bi/Pan ladies, but it is a pattern that a lot of gay girls pick up on and many have experienced themselves. I have a theory that many of these women aren't actually Pan/Bi, but heterosexual assholes who want to wear a Lesbian badge of honour."
