And yes, you can't account for all factors/variables In studies.  It would be idiotic to assume anybody does.  That's when you rely on the reputation of the source.  Plenty of good orgs with good data.  At the very least, you can get govt data in excellent form from the nonprofit usafacts.com

But anyway, here you go.  The CBO is what our govt has always relied on to get reliable unbiased data:

https://www.npr.org/2019/07/08/739607964/-15-minimum-wage-would-boost-17-million-workers-cut-1-3-million-jobs-cbo-says
Especially note the bit about $12 min wage.

There have been other studies, but honestly, don't have the time to waste googling more than the 2 seconds I did.  My opinion was shaped by such studies because the topic in interested me over the years.  So not based on one study or the other.  The negatives just don't outweigh the positives when it comes to minimum wage increases. 

On unions:
Wages haven't been keeping up partly because unions don't have the power they used to.  When wages are stagnant it's not good for anybody.  Unless you're a billionaire you know somebody who works for a living.  You want strong unions to balance out the power of big business."

The only difference that happens is that the standards for minimum wage workers improve.  This isn't me saying, this basically every study that's been done of the process.  It's not like the min. wage hasn't been raised before, or experimented with (e.g. Seattle, etc)."
