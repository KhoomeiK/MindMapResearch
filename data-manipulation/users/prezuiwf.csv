I also love how you realized how unhinged your own argument was so you put ""be a little wary"" instead of ""ban the children from ever stepping foot on your property"" because this travel ban is sure as hell not an example of us letting in immigrants but being ""wary"" of them. Like at NO point when you typed that did you have second thoughts about actually putting it out there into the world? I knew Trumpers were fucking stupid but this is bizarre even for someone who supports this xenophobic policy. And you lied so nakedly and effortlessly with your initial comment and then just abandoned the premise immediately after being called out, like do YOU even buy the bullshit you spew?"

Obviously you're going to twist whatever justification you want inside your own mind because you've already decided you want this music and will tell yourself whatever you want to make it seem like it's ok that you're doing this, but you are literally the reason bands like Judas Priest release albums less frequently and new bands are able to catch on far less frequently."

This is literally the definition of piracy. I hate to be ""that guy"" but you can buy this CD on Amazon for under $10, even if you're in high school you can work a minimum wage job for an hour and 20 minutes and make enough to afford that. Instead you ripped off the entire album and posted it on the internet for people to download for free. And you didn't even buy the album the first time in order to do that, you ripped these songs from OTHER rips and then stitched them together. I can't see any way that you weren't ""trying to rip off the band"" when you did this."

But the second time I watched it, I realized that the themes of the ending were always staring us right in the face, but they were sometimes difficult to notice unless you were looking for them.

He has a World Series win as part of his legacy, yet he also left a long trail of horrible seasons in his wake, seasons in which a less spendthrift owner could have made real improvements. In his 26 seasons at the helm, 19 as sole owner, we reached the playoffs twice. He treated the team largely as a moneymaker for himself where he fielded a team most years simply because he was required to. Some people might remember him for the Gordon/Cain/Hosmer years but I'll always remember him for the Neifi Perez/Carlos Febles/Angel Berroa years and the atrocious money-saving decisions that crippled the club in those seasons.

AskReddit,felvkge,t1_felgnox,1579232016.0,"I got married in Bangladesh and they do this thing called a Holud which is the first of three days of wedding events, and one of the things they do there is that the bride and groom sit in front of the room and all their family and friends come up to them one-by-one and feed them a piece of cake or sweets. On the table were about a dozen different types of dessert food, and then there was a bowl of grapes. The red ones had seeds, but the green ones did not. After the first couple of people did their thing, a huge amount of people after that made the same ""Bet you're tired of sweets by now!"" comment, and opted to feed us each a grape instead. Yet in the greatest instance of statistical probability I've ever been a part of, the entire time I only got ONE green grape. I couldn't select my own grapes (other people were picking them up and feeding them to me) and I swear I had to chow down on 40 fucking grapes with big ol' seeds in them (there was no place to spit out the seeds and I don't think anyone even knew some of the grapes had seeds in them, so I opted to just put on a smile and eat them). The seeds weren't as hard as, say, cherry seeds, so they could be chewed a bit and swallowed, but they tasted awful and the entire sensation was very unpleasant.

So yeah, fuck seeded grapes."

KCRoyals,feic0dp,t1_fei6262,1579134966.0,"> I harbor a real resentment towards these Boras-led players who torpedo team spending and don’t live up to the potential.

You literally did say that. But beyond that, my point is that players are not responsible for managing a team's budget, the management is. Players are responsible for getting the best contracts they can.

It should be common knowledge at this point that you don't overpay players coming off career years, but somehow GMs are still dumb enough to do it."
KCRoyals,fei1w10,t1_fehzeyi,1579128468.0,"Why would you resent a player trying to get as much money as he can? He didn't hold the team at gunpoint. Anyone could have made any offer to him in the open market. If he's a financial strain on the organization, they should be pissed at the Padres' front office for making that offer, not at Hosmer for taking it.

Edit: Just to add more context, I count myself among KC fans who pretty much knew any offer to Hosmer was going to be too much. San Diego offered an 8-year deal to a guy coming off a career year in 2017, which literally almost never works, ever. The last two years have been comparable to his 2016 season; he's always been an up-and-down player and this level of production was not unpredictable. I chuckle every time a front office offers a contract with the expectation that a player is going to keep repeating, or improving upon, his latest statistical outlier of a season every single year. It just never works out like that."
