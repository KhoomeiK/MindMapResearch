PublicFreakout,ff5ozyp,t1_ff5h6ga,1579604041.0,"not just in India. In Hollywood, in America, in Japan too, men are devalued.

It's most notable in, honestly, anime. 

Men are by and large portrayed as misogynistic perverts. They are punished (usually) with physical violence from mainly women.

In a sense, this is not unwanted by the male audience in that they have accepted this portrayal of masculinity, accepting it for the sake of cheap erotic feelings. 

If they aren't perverts, they're headstrong and reckless and usually require either a decidedly less masculine or just a girl to keep them in check - again a negative (with positive aspects) trait of traditional masculinity.


Part of this is indicative of the audience consuming it, but I still think it points to a devaluation of men:

the growing genre of ""cute girls doing things.""

Audiences are eating it up - the attraction to the activity is usually secondary to the attraction to the idea of girls doing it.

Cute guys/masculine guys doing things (usually somewhat normal things, im making exceptions for most shounen jump stuff) is far less popular in comparison."

Kappa,fekqqlg,t1_fekpwv0,1579205653.0,"Well, I think you're honing in on ""similar"" moves like f-smash or even down smash sometimes and not looking holistically at the whole way a character plays. Fox and Marth might throw out a similar hitbox for their f-smash (fox privilege means fox's fsmash is way bigger than his leg) doesn't mean they play at all the same.

Look at melee (where the roster is more pronounced and less uniformity among character playstyles).

Jigglypuff is a floaty character who relies on spacing with extended aerials like bair and fair, plus multiple jumps, to stay off the ground and more mobile. While whether or not such a character prone to camping is healthy for the game is up for debate, a jigglypuff player can't very well switch to fox and do the same thing, at all.

Captain Falcon usually plays very aggressive, turning throws, dash attacks, specials and other approaches into extended combos.

Yoshi has super armor for some weird reason on his double jump, and yoshi mains use this to full effect to do some very weird things with the character. Eggs are used for spacing. one of the more unique characters.



I have not played THAT much GG/SF or any SC. But I see similarities in projectiles, ""sweeps,"" grabs, aerials, and approaches.
