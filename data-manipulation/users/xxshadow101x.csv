depression,ffh0ew5,t3_etk5ny,1579919765.0,Good job dude glad u feel like you had a good day. Good days can be rare sometimes so when they come around it hits different.
depression,ffas65v,t3_eskmjm,1579743239.0,"Cant help but feel this, I get you. I fail at everything I ever do and am already really self conscious so I just stoped trying anything all together. I'm not old enough to get a job yet but I feel the same thing will happen to me when I am old enough. I get the though of just never feeling like you'll amount to anything when you cant do the simplest of things correctly. I feel for you bud."
depression,ff4hunu,t3_ererwo,1579563980.0,Its too difficult. I go through a day just for another to appear. There is no reat the only time you get to stop is death.
depression,fep1ueq,t3_eq3hqt,1579310256.0,"Not sure if anyone else can relate but I like chill music, so I enjoy Khai dreams and cavetown alot. Not sure what your forte is but just thought I would throw it out there."
depression,fefrxnz,t3_eox1ej,1579063418.0,I'm not helpful but I just wanted to say I'm sorry to hear that. I had a friend that was abused but not to the degree you describe and I had no idea how to help her. All I know how to say is I'm sorry about that. Sorry I cant say anything to help
depression,fecfvdl,t3_eoclci,1578972924.0,"I admire your enthusiasm towards beating your depression. That's a huge step in my mid to beating depression. Good luck mate, no doubt u can't do it."

depression,fdm11t3,t1_fdlzdtw,1578537270.0,"Hey thanks for the help even if you dont think anything of it just this did help me out. And I also feel you in sitting alone in class, it sucks being the only one not having anyone to talk with in class too. But thanks for saying something."
depression,fdg8pki,t3_el7p7n,1578384781.0,I feel you
depression,fdg0edm,t3_el68mc,1578375514.0,"I know how that feels but at least you have one thing that you can do to ease your pain. It sucks to just wallow in the pain with nothing to help out. Also I enjoyed your poem and thought it was nice, so if nothing else it helped me feel just a tiny bit better so thanks! :)"
depression,fdg00ze,t3_el6ccc,1578375167.0,"I thought this too but it seems were not the only ones. I dont take shame in it anymore, because it helps me so if it helps you its nothing to feel bad about. Infact its great if it does help."
depression,fdeyhva,t3_el170m,1578349298.0,Same when ever I would say something first though although they replied eventually it was clear they didn't really want to talk and just kept the conversation short. Eventually its gotten to the point to where we never talk unless I say something and they domt even respond really anymore. It makes me feel like a fool. So yeah I feel you 100%
depression,fdd2ybt,t3_ekp8u4,1578292652.0,"Thats honestly okay, you know its bad and your trying to fix it. Slip ups are going to happen, its the way things are. Dont beat yourself up over the mistakes because you'll end up giving in and falling back into the pattern. I know what it feels like and the shame that can be felt in comming back to it. We just gotta try our best to fix it. Also sorry for whatever your going through, this might not have helped so just know that I tried. This also might not have made sense so sorry if thats the case. Hope you have a good day stranger!"
depression,fdd24ux,t3_ekpghk,1578291760.0,Nice poem!

depression,fcwr3kn,t3_ej9fo3,1578034280.0,"Thats exactly what I think, why do people say things like that. Its like come on bitch pick how you feel about me, if you care about me then act like it. You can't just leave me and say ""oh, but ill miss u"""
depression,fcm2n9a,t3_ehpwn0,1577762637.0,Hey I'm a little late but happy birthday!
depression,fck0t5b,t3_ehkqlo,1577713043.0,"Sometimes when I wrote down my problems it helps a little bit, so I hope it helped you to talk about at least. Especially when you feel lonely or like there's nobody around to talk to."
depression,fcjav2m,t3_ehg01s,1577681655.0,You should be proud of yourself bc that's a really good accomplishment . To top it off you had a good time and that's all that matters.
depression,fc7p8w1,t3_eginwb,1577514984.0,"I'm can't do a thing to help. I'm only 14, so I don't know shit, but I'm sorry about whats happened to you. I hope that whatever happens to you, you'll find a place where your okay. Wheather your alive or not I dont know, but I wish you the best."
