AmItheAsshole,ffhfiqb,t1_fffyfuj,1579933091.0,"I started getting SPD pain really early on, so I spent at least half my pregnancy unable to walk without a ton of pain. It actually kind of upsets me now to think about how many times I had to hobble myself to the bus stop after work, in the middle of winter, with screaming pain in my pelvis for the whole 10 min walk. I ended up going on mat leave nearly two months early because my body was just pushed to its limit. 

It's definitely rewarding, but absolutely has its miserable parts and it's ok to feel those feelings about it."
AmItheAsshole,ffhf2ow,t1_ffgdl7h,1579932570.0,"Right? I honestly didn't have a preference, and when we found out we were having a boy I was like ""Cool! That works for me!"". I don't know how else I'd have answered the question"
AmItheAsshole,ffhex83,t1_ffgr7nq,1579932404.0,"Pregnancy is one of the reasons my son will remain an only child. Thinking about going through that again (hyperemesis gang represent! Vomiting every day at work was the best!) along with the problematic labour and delivery and the ages of recovery it took me afterwards... Not for me. 

I'm so thrilled for people who loved being pregnant and who had a relatively good go of things, but that definitely wasn't my experience and that's ok."
LuLaNo,ffhe8n3,t1_ffhdioq,1579931663.0,"I feel like it says XL but honestly it could be anything haha

It's wild there's no way to tell the size of LLR clothes by looking at them because they're all over the place!"
LuLaNo,ffhbk41,t3_eqmh9s,1579928925.0,"I'd wear it with black jeans and flats. 

But more reasonably I'd probably *say* I'd wear it, buy it, then keep it in my closet."
LuLaNo,ffhawvs,t3_eqntjm,1579928307.0,I had to do this once when I stupidly wore a maxi dress to the park with my son and the grass was still wet. It was uncomfortable and looked so dumb. I can't imagine this being a default look.
LuLaNo,ffhad7d,t3_er3h6t,1579927799.0,"I feel like where I live I could wear these unironically and get away with it. 

I actually kind of want them to wear to yoga now."
LuLaNo,ffha7ln,t3_erpe6p,1579927659.0,The one on the right kinda reminds me of a Franz Ferdinand music video and for that I don't hate it.
LuLaNo,ffh9tda,t1_ffh04m2,1579927299.0,"The founder, Deanne."
LuLaNo,ffh9dgr,t3_er7vl3,1579926901.0,Kind of want that ice cream sandwich shirt though
LuLaNo,ffh2nbr,t1_ffbbrrh,1579921458.0,I wish it said Poopin.
LuLaNo,ffh2ier,t3_eszl2b,1579921354.0,"Some of these ugly prints I low key can see the appeal of, especially the earth tone ones. I have questionable taste. But this one has *zero* redeeming factors. None."
LuLaNo,ffh2f8y,t3_et5d7c,1579921286.0,So glad you said it was Cupids. All I saw were tire tracks until I re-read the title.
LuLaNo,ffh2aub,t1_ffd18wg,1579921194.0,"The dodos are weird as leggings, but would be absolutely adorable as a romper! 

Congrats on the new baby!"
