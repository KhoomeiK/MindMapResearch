In Star Trek, concepts are grounded in science. They ""reverse the polarity,"" but utilize sound concepts like The Alcubierre drive, advanced molecular 3D printing, prosthetics for the blind, organic computing (Voyager) etc. You do have Q. How does he work? Literally a being from a higher dimension who is not at all bound by the constructs of time, space, or limited human perception. Both an individual and a part of a whole. Prophets/wormhole aliens. Higher beings who are incapable of understanding linear time at first, beings who exist outside and above us, but still challenged by our existence, initially seeing the idea of our existence as subterfuge. In both situations a lower being must make a case for our very existence.

Those tax cuts were necessary, consumer spending is the most important part of a capitalist economy. While Republicans wrongly keep claiming we need to cut taxes for the rich and huge companies (it never works), Dems understand that poor and middle class folks spending money is what is needed. Some argue we should have given more cuts/credits to the poor and middle class.
