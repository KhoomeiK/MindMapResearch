AskReddit,ffq2ilt,t3_eulcyl,1580116820.0,"Dude at a music festival pulled out a huge bag of cocaine and tried to sell me and my friends some. We're not into that sort of thing and walked away from him. He started following us so we walked near the police hoping he would leave us. Instead this dude went up to the police and asked THEM if they would like to buy some cocaine. Got arrested immediately.

Wasn't a very fun festival but at least something exciting happened. It was one of those free, open to anyone type festivals."
AskReddit,ffq26yc,t3_eulcgf,1580116307.0,"I never worked for someone other than family except if you count internships which were mandatory for school. Thus, i have no real job experience i can refer to during interviews and they usually pick someone who has. I'm 23 now and i feel it's too late and i'm not being taken serious by potential future employers."

AskReddit,ffli4i6,t1_ffl4jhf,1580039959.0,Going outside and socializing makes me feel more alone than staying in my room. Mainly because it reminds me that i can't be happy and others can.
AskReddit,fflhq0x,t1_ffl3v1m,1580039824.0,"And often there is no immediate cause or solution. If people ask you ""what's wrong?"" and you truly don't know, you're probably depressed."
AskReddit,fflgwak,t1_ffl3uhw,1580039573.0,"For me it was receiving good news that i had been waiting for for a while and not feeling anything, that i realized i should be happy but was completely numb."
AskReddit,fflegy6,t3_eu53cn,1580038590.0,"That it's not about ""looking for attention"". IRL, only my mom, brother, doctor and psychologist know about it. I don't like talking about it unless absolutely neccesary.

Also just because i appear happy or am laughing doesn't mean i feel better overall. It simply means i found a way to distract myself for the time being. Some days are worst than others.

People suffering from depression don't all cry a lot. Some of us cry only a little or not at all.

Not every depressed person is also actively suicidal. Some don't think about it at all or only on occasion. I often think ""i could jump infront of this train/car and it will all be over"" but i never had the urge to actually do it.

And finally, just because others have it worse doesn't mean i don't have the ""right"" or ""justification"" to feel how i feel."
