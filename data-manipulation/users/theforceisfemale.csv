Of course she dropped out. You’re prioritizing what you want in the pictures over your (supposed) friend’s physical appearance. 

It would be like telling a bridesmaid ‘you can be in my wedding if you lose 20 lbs’. It’s worse than other AITA posts I’ve seen about making people walk around without their prescription glasses all day, or cover their tattoos.

Her hair isn’t ‘vibrant’. She’s a natural redhead, it’s not purple or neon green. And no it is not going to ruin your photos so calm down. No one (except apparently you somehow) is going to look at your pictures and be like ‘oh, if only she’d made the one bridesmaid shave her head, it ruins the whole aesthetic’.

People change their minds. She is allowed to reevaluate what she wants to do. I know that you have not changed your mind, and that you had an agreement, but people change.

If she now wants to keep it, thatâ€™s a serious discussion you need to be willing to have together â€” lovingly. Not in this â€˜BUT YOU SAID!!!â€™ way. Listen to her, really listen. And she needs to really listen to you."
