nfl,ffn19yk,t1_ffmf3t4,1580060972.0,"Fans are fleeting as fuck. I'm sure you've seen the offhand comments about the Patriots from some media/fans in a year where they went 12-4 this year... some fans just can't handle a modicum of adversity with their team, especially when they've been conditioned to expect success.

Thankfully y'all have a front office that understands that unless you're coached by the greatest coach of all time your team is going to have ups and downs."

StarWars,ffgx17i,t1_ffglxiy,1579917233.0,"That's true for the most part. I'd argue it was a bit in turmoil because of the complete an utter lack of any plan for the whole series, but nothing super surprising happened mid production"
StarWars,fffnlxw,t1_fffijjk,1579887824.0,Has problems? Yes. Changes writers and/or directors either right as production starts or halfway through? No
StarWars,fff5iuq,t1_ffe4rcp,1579876235.0,"Certainly feels like the top brass at lucasfilm is sabotaging itself.

nfl,feb0vu0,t1_feaqe86,1578954325.0,In the 28 games he's started for us he's had 8 holding calls and 3 false starts called on him. By comparison O'Neill has had 6 holding calls and 7 false starts in his 26 starts.
nfl,feapraj,t1_feamofo,1578951151.0,He looks average by old LT standards but what I was saying is he's actually noticeably above average. The league only has a few actually really good LTs. It's extraordinarily unlikely we'd be able to replace him with someone of the same caliber even if we spent our first round pick on one.
nfl,fea058r,t1_fe9fwwy,1578943038.0,"Reiff is a solid LT. Not the best but certainly above average. Most LTs in the league atm are bad, we'd be wrong to let him go."
nfl,fe6l36v,t1_fe4drgy,1578894482.0,He's single handedly caused us to lose a few games the last couple years tho. If he didn't play like shit last year we likely squeeze into the playoffs at least.
nfl,fe5ngqm,t1_fe5kjvy,1578871787.0,"Yeah we really want him back in MN now that Stef is gone, he is a really good OC."
todayilearned,fe3phxu,t1_fe33cav,1578851652.0,He probably just dodge rolled away from it
nfl,fdzgmtc,t1_fdzft05,1578790007.0,We've been inconsistent all year regardless of that tho. It's been very frustrating.
nfl,fdzchit,t1_fdzc8ah,1578788898.0,Sometimes we show up to games. Other times we don't. Simple as that. I'm sure 5 days of rest between road games didn't help either--not that that was the main reason we lost but why our entire team ran out of gas early.
nfl,fdzc8fq,t3_enfzgc,1578788755.0,"Well at least we defeated the salt factory last week.

GG SF, good luck next week!"
nfl,fdz9t4f,t1_fdz7dvk,1578788055.0,Yeah definitely. We have a great tradition of doing well enough to get to the playoffs but then not going further. We've also been a low seed pretty often so that leaves us in a tough spot to make a run in the playoffs
nfl,fdz6mxs,t1_fdz69sl,1578787194.0,Nope the cards are the 2nd worst winning% franchise of all time. But you can just look at the list for the rest

nfl,fdz4hdn,t1_fdz413q,1578786625.0,I don't like kamara but I do like drew. Kamara has proven himself petty a few times already
nfl,fdz3ezs,t1_fdz28yp,1578786291.0,At least we beat the Packers more than once every 6 games...

nfl,fdxzpw3,t1_fdxx582,1578774578.0,"I still have some hope of the next trilogy, I'm hoping they'll actually realize their biggest mistake and let Filoni or someone write the outline for the whole trilogy and it'll be based in a different time period in the star wars universe with different force users. 

There's a lot of interesting tidbits about other force users in both the old EU and even a little in the new EU. Fallen order starts to explore one of them"
nfl,fdxxy44,t1_fdxkd5f,1578774044.0,Uh yeah right it _is_ 2020...
nfl,fdxji3f,t1_fdw6fk7,1578769301.0,"Winfield retired a bit ago but he's 42 compared to Newman's 41 and his son is going to be a 2nd-3rd round pick in the draft next year, so definitely."
nfl,fdnmlc4,t1_fdn8nfa,1578588936.0,"I guess he was about the same age. Palmer was also not going to play for Cincy though so they had no reason to keep him. Stafford isn't that type of player so it would be an actual big loss in production for them.

I'd also argue Stafford's been overall better than Palmer was"
minnesotavikings,fdmdcy0,t1_fdmbse9,1578546273.0,"Harris also knows players typically get one big contract in their career unless they're generational talents. Sure maybe if he took a 3yr deal, played at the same level, and stayed healthy, he'd get that one mega deal bigger, but otherwise he'll get more on the open market.

I'm actually of the opinion don't draft a CB early. Draft mid-late round ones. We've been wasting 1sts on mediocre CBs for the better part of a decade already. Rhodes was good for a couple years but otherwise was mediocre.

Edit: Also you literally described Rudolph in your TE description. Good pass catching TE who is a good blocker."
nfl,fdmbuwq,t1_fdm9g95,1578545014.0,A tier 2 QB like Stafford would cost multiple firsts. Carson Palmer cost firsts when he was traded and he was like 5 years older and out of football for a year before one of them...

minnesotavikings,fdm911q,t1_fdm7mmj,1578542817.0,Uhh we spent a first on Smith back in 2012... if we think he's BPA we definitely could. Remember last year when we spend a 2nd on a TE despite having a TE? Or 2017 with a CB in the first when we didn't need one... or one of many other cases before that.
minnesotavikings,fdl8o4l,t1_fdkudel,1578518928.0,Which is a 100% reasonable place for us to grab a safety to replace Harris with (it's seemingly very unlikely we'll be able to afford to re-sign him)
minnesotavikings,fdi1xjn,t1_fdhj8t2,1578434278.0,"I mean it would be that it's just not working out beneath the cover of the team. We all know this is Zimmer's defense, Edwards is just part of the implementation. 

If we were to part ways though it would most likely be when Edwards contract ran up and/or if someone poached him for a HC position."
nfl,fdh5kwc,t1_fdh2zbf,1578415862.0,"On the other hand, somehow he/your offense made typically decent to good receivers look bad."

nfl,fdgsmhj,t1_fdgr9iz,1578407278.0,So Chiefs or Ravens are winning it all this year
nfl,fdffkdy,t1_fdfa86y,1578360527.0,None really. We didn't show up.
nfl,fdf7l4n,t1_fdf1fj6,1578355155.0,"What's weird is the Packers don't have a _great_ defense, just a solid one this year (overall their defense finished ranked around where the Saints/Broncos/Eagles/Chargers defenses did this season, all games Cousins did well in)... but for whatever reason we didn't show up to either of the games vs GB--especially true of our offensive line.

Considering how many sacks the Saints have gotten this year they did surprisingly well last week. If we want to have a real shot of winning this week they'll need to continue that level of play, otherwise Bosa will kill Kirk."
nfl,fdf6swz,t3_el1w8r,1578354627.0,"If I wanted to take a gamble on a mostly unproven offensive minded guy (and let's be real, if you're getting an offensive minded HC you either get one who's already failed as a HC or an unproven guy with 1-3yrs as OC) he'd be the guy I'd go after."
nfl,fdf41v7,t1_fdezz7q,1578352819.0,"tbf they do have a legit excuse for both this year, even in your first game they were on their 6th rounder backup in his first start."

nfl,fdeu7de,t1_fded2a3,1578346693.0,"Have some patience. Moore is a very young OC. You were 6th in scoring and 1st in yds/g. Even if some of that came during garbage time that's still very, very good."
nfl,fdetqdi,t1_fden31i,1578346410.0,"...The only coaches available with past HC experience are proven HCs who have been on a team and failed for the most part.

CFB head coaching is also _vastly_ different than NFL head coaching. Half of it is recruiting the right players, a quarter is developing them to have decent technique/instincts, and a quarter is building the right system around them. NFL head coaching is about turning that decent technique into mastery and finding the ideal system that doesn't only _kind of_ fit your personnel, but fits the team like a glove."
programming,fdepn63,t1_fddjegs,1578343993.0,"If your UI test breaks because of a simple CSS change I would argue your UI tests are likely more brittle than they should be. 

I won't argue that UI tests aren't more brittle than other tests but using proper strategies while developing them (e.g. something as simple as waiting for the footer of a page to load before looking at the UI rather than waiting for a random individual element) can limit the brittleness."
nfl,fdel6fg,t1_fdejoe5,1578341365.0,Yeah but then they'd have to blame McVay and the bad contracts floating all around the offense...
minnesotavikings,fdehq9w,t1_fde560w,1578339274.0,Kendricks has been absurd this year. I love Hunter and Cook but Kendricks not only hasn't made more than a couple mistakes but he's come up huge several times.

nfl,fdd6hai,t1_fdcw1x2,1578296917.0,"It's his first year as OC. He was always going to be rough at times.

nfl,fdb7o8z,t1_fdb3k8x,1578254701.0,Falcons are typically pretty good... They're gonna be good again next year too
nfl,fdb3flw,t1_fdb2zhp,1578253253.0,"Same with NFL though--depends where you are when it comes to following a team, but if you're in, say, Baltimore, you'll always get the Ravens every week."

nfl,fd751ov,t1_fd72x5v,1578199526.0,Same with the '17 Vikings. One of the better defenses statistically in recent memory but just couldn't get it done in the playoffs.
nfl,fd741s5,t1_fd73a4b,1578199156.0,"Nah, there is. Similar to someone using a new exploit in a video game tournament it's technically legal as is but will be patched out. Anybody willingly using that knowing clear as day it's going to be fixed is doing it sleazily.

The reputable way to treat that knowledge when it's found out is to report it to the people who write the rules and let them make changes before it can be abused."
nfl,fd70e2a,t1_fd6zf2o,1578197934.0,Against Belichick? Maybe. But it's a sleazy loophole to the rule otherwise. Similar to the eligible receiver bullshit Belichick used to beat you guys back in 2015. Not what the rulebook intended.

nfl,fd5ohjl,t1_fd5oab9,1578179686.0,You typically can't give yourself up by walking slowly. It has to be a deliberate act like sliding or taking a knee.
nfl,fd0j3wx,t1_fd0enxh,1578119549.0,"uhh you do realize most NFL coaches are failed players right? They either didn't make the NFL because they weren't good enough or bombed out. Very, very few were actually even decent players."

minnesotavikings,fctmdaq,t1_fctm4nm,1577948786.0,Oh yeah we absolutely shouldn't draft him based on what we need. The only situation in which we should draft him is if Diggs or Thielen were _actually_ unhappy and demanded a trade so we lost a WR and got an extra late 1st to spend on him.
minnesotavikings,fctm3hm,t1_fcspym4,1577948451.0,"He was projected as a mid 2nd round pick before the game, but with the huge game if he has a good combine he'll likely go late first."
