todayilearned,fdy2i3t,t1_fdwg256,1578775345.0,The demonestizing thing was just one example. Youtube is owned by google and if i have to spell out for you all the reasons google is unethical for you to pick a part then you really should just do the research on your own. Google steals peoples info and sells it and they are basically ruling the world and selling it piece by piece. This post isnt going to get enough visibility for me to waste my time telling you tbe million unethicL things google/youtube has done. I cant believe i even have to... People on the internet are already supposed to know more about how unethical google is. If you dont know then what hope is their for the geberal public that doesmt use reddit 😞
todayilearned,fdvzecb,t1_fdu3j8x,1578753455.0,"For someone with a 9 year old account I cant believe you havent seen the 100s of posts over the years of people getting screwed over by youtube. Almost everyone I see on this site seems to agree that they hate youtube for how unethical they are all the time when they ban youtube contributors all the time and ignore their appeals. You really expect me to believe youve been on reddit 9 uears and you havent seen one single front page post of someine claiming all their videos got banned and demonetised for aome bogus reason and youtuve igbore their appeals? Wtf youve had to have seen those posts they happen nearly everyday from what ive seen.

Granted a lot of peoole that ""hate""  youtube and notice their unethical behavior still have an account but to act like you dont ecen notice why everyone hates youtube after having an account 9 years is unfathomable."
todayilearned,fdvxzvh,t1_fdu3j8x,1578753040.0,Youtube is unethical because they ban peoples accounts all the time without a good reason. Ive seen 100 different stories on reddit of people that had all their life's work banned from YouTube when their submissions were pulled and their account was banned all because some more powerful person reached out to youtube to get them banned. These people hadoriginal content they worked hard on and youtube banned their account and demonetised them because they were conflicting with some youtube partner that generated even more money.

PublicFreakout,fdt6t1h,t3_emwd3r,1578712674.0,Putting away your carts and groceries you decide you dont want should not be your job. Corporations have tricked and manipulated you all into chastising people who dont do this so that they can save on employee costs. I work at cvs and im happy to clean up after people and put their carts away because as long as they dont do it ill still have a job and more hours. Ive seen the store im at go from 20 people to 8 within the last 10 years and tgats not including the pharmacy. All 12 of those people got laid off because there became less worj for them because of corporate tactics like this. Some day I probably wont have a job anymore either so that rich shareholders can get more profits. Many cashiers and supervisors dont realise this and theyd prefer to not have as much work but truat me that I know for a fact that guilting customers like this is costing us our jobs.

Also I did make reddit better wiyh my comment. It got that bot shill account deleted and if I blocked him he wouldve kept spamming and been used to shill. As i said thats whats ruining this site.

And to save you the trouble of looking at my reddit age its like 9 years."
whitepeoplegifs,fd7b6qh,t1_fd55o55,1578201843.0,All this could be avoided to if idiots could tell a shill post when they see one. If a post mentions some random product its probably paid advertising using fake bot accounts and all these sheep dont realise it

whitepeoplegifs,fd4j053,t1_fd3x9ks,1578167896.0,You stole /u/pagaaaya comment word for word and hi jacked it onto a post at the top of the thread
Futurology,fcp6ag7,t1_fcnuk56,1577851873.0,Ur right he could actually still be alive in witness protection. No one ever says this for some reason.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcot4x8,t1_fco1pb1,1577840836.0,"You guys are such fools. All it takes to get someone to walk in traffic is threaten to kill everyone they ever knew. All these mysterious deaths that are proven suicide are just people that had their familiea threatened if they didnt kill themselves.  

On a related note Jeffrey Epstein may be still alive in witness protection and his death was staged like they do a lot for people in witness protection. If you dont see photos of all these dead people they could just be faking death to be in witness protection. No one ever mentions this!!!!"
likeus,fb74qxg,t1_fb52k93,1576573856.0,"Interesting. I guess when youre not busy trafficing drugs and ""providing protection"" to local stores, you have a lot of time to learn how to save lives and actually help citizens. Where I live all the cops do is bust opposing drug runners that arent working for the same people as the cities elite. If you ever saw super troopers or know about serpico thats what my city is about. All the cops know to do is run drugs for china because the federal reserve is bankrupt."
