My only experience with Deaf culture/community is my ASL class in high school. Most of us were hearing, and had a genuine interest in learning the language, but the teacher made it hard for us. She absolutely hated teaching hearing kids, and would mock us when we made mistakes. She took attendance on the first day of class by finger spelling each of our names, knowing good and well that a lot of the students didn't even know the alphabet yet. Those who failed to respond because they couldn't recognize their names were marked absent. I was glad I at least knew the alphabet.
