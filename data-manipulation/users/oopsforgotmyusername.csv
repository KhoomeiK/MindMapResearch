Just to be clear I think UBI is needed in a post automation society, and I think the USA is uniquely able to fund such a program due to its absolutely bonkers military spending and its ability to easily tax corporations and the extremely wealthy who live and operate within its borders.

My problem with his health care plan is I don't believe a private option should exist. I believe that at best its a trap and at worst it creates a tiered care system where private care is vastly superior to public care and where those with private care will be prioritized over others due to increased profit margins for the hospitals or providers. I admit I'm not an expert in this field so my understanding is limited.

Having lived in a country with a VAT I can't say I like the idea of paying even more for my products than I already do, and in my experience that's what happens with a VAT. The company passes that cost on to the consumer rather than paying it themselves. Again though, I am aware that I'm not an expert on the ins and outs of VAT, only that I lived in the EU for half my life.
