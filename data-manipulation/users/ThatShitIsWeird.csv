Every day last week a seller had them on sale for 300, but they would sell out their 10 within an hour and it would go back to the $455 one.  I would suggest checking amazon multiple times a day, it seemed 10am to 12pm EST would be when the new stock would come up.

It was always third party sellers that had them."

clusterheads,fcjannt,t3_eh1ol1,1577681493.0,"I don't think the human race is good at empathizing with invisible pain, myself included.  Even if someone does empathize with you, they can only really do it from their experiences.  If someone you know has never even had a migraine, they'll never understand the pain.  Even if they have had a migraine, they will remember that and say yeah that sucks.  When you have invisible non-lifethreatining pain every day for a month (or less even) people will never understand without shared experience.  I notice that even my wife goes from sympathetic, to nothing, to annoyance over the course of my periods.  She's also mentioned sometimes in a fit that its ""concenient"" that I got one right before I was supposed to do something.  I don't blame her because I know she'll never understand and I just say ""if I had a choice it wouldn't be a headache.""  It becomes more real for her when I get up at one in the morning to huff oxygen or sit in the shower for 45 minutes.

I don't really have a solution for you other than to keep this in mind and plan accordingly.  Nobody will ever understand and the longer your period goes, the more annoyed they'll get and the more they'll think you're faking it.  Do what you can to find meds that work, hopefully."
