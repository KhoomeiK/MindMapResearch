I met a local artists who was working at my UPS store and bought one of my favorite pieces of art from her that day! You can find her instagram at wiltedflowerart"

oddlyterrifying,ffayvx6,t1_ffacmlc,1579747691.0,Tell him I‚Äôll pay for a signed replica poster of the original. I‚Äôd also buy a set of 10 postcards or note cards with a copy of the original on them.

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre sad right now. I‚Äôm sorry your friends don‚Äôt seem to care. I care.

I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre finding some comfort in lyrics and a couple of chords. I promise, things really do and will get better.

Xoxo,

Vow"

jobs,ff4l13z,t1_ff3b0wr,1579566180.0,I‚Äôm curious what that article says about how people are hired? Can you share a link to it or elaborate on what methods did work?
mildlyinfuriating,feyq5jf,t1_fey1qxd,1579449172.0,Fancy retort.
mildlyinfuriating,fetrf3j,t1_fetqcbm,1579378889.0,"Okay...from an artist point, true. I actually  find all these types of time lapse paintings, especially the ones that end in a cemetery, mildly infuriating. But that‚Äôs just personal taste."

mildlyinfuriating,fetp1m4,t1_fetmty1,1579377844.0,It‚Äôs only not noticeable to those who see the same trees often. A few decades of growth would definitely show.
mildlyinfuriating,fetotrp,t1_fetjzn5,1579377760.0,I disagree. I think people just don‚Äôt notice because the growth is subtle and you see it everyday. I bet if you look at a picture from 25 years ago and today you‚Äôd see a difference.
mildlyinfuriating,fetijev,t1_fet9fy8,1579375801.0,How is that possible?

mash,fdppiak,t3_emimay,1578635662.0,I wonder if an actor now with such a visible physical difference could get cast in a movie/sitcom? My guess is no. And then that makes me wonder how he got into acting and how he was picked for the  role.

AskReddit,fdb1612,t1_fdayam9,1578252564.0,But are the belief AND the action necessary for outcomes? Seems the action is enough.
AskReddit,fdaxilt,t1_fdax9tm,1578251560.0,"I don‚Äôt think it influences outcomes either, but so many people seem to believe it does that I find myself wondering."
