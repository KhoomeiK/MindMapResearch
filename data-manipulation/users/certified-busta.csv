I think a good reason why they get so much flak is because people know that Ubi are more than capable of making awesome games. I certainly think so, at least a quarter of my library is made up of their titles. Assassins Creed, For Honor, Watch Dogs, The Division, Wildlands - they're all games that have their issues but are great at their core.

edit: They don't appear to have any plans on changing the animations, which I find kinda weird because it seemed to be one of the more criticised elements of the game when the trailers/beta came out.

Honestly, I would probably give the game a shot but the character movement is overwhelmingly offputting for me. They can improve enemy AI, the ingame economy, change the tiered loot system and all that, but I can't get over the way Ghosts move.

Maybe it's just me, but if your character moves like an absolute donkus then I can't immerse myself in the role.
