iamatotalpieceofshit,ff0io81,t1_ff0i54k,1579469198.0,"I live in a rural area... and if you do this in a rural area, fine. But taking a dog on the freeway is not safe for other drivers or the dog if the dog slips and falls off for whatever reason."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff0apsv,t1_fezrfi5,1579466938.0,I am certainly not the type of person that would see a siberian in the snow and claim abuse. The fact of that matter is that this dog was on a FLATBED on the freeway. Anything can happen on the freeway. A tire could get thrown from someone else and they swerve and guess where that dog would land.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fewwzhi,t1_fewwo1i,1579420782.0,"Right. I kinda think some people who work on farms see dogs as more useful than just pets. And although I can agree on parts of that, they were hauling a trailer with a tack room and I feel like the dog would possibly be safer in there. I get it, but to go on the freeway with the poor thing exposed like that just hurt my heart. It wasn't the warmest day either."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fewvxt6,t1_fewvnu9,1579420331.0,Well I followed this guy off the freeway. I'm pretty sure it was his dog though.

Never feel bad about feeling that way. Some women feel they are destined to be moms, others aren't. It says nothing about your character and it's not a ""good"" or ""bad"" thing when people feel one way or another. As long as you and your child are happy and healthy that is all that matters."

He was very sweet though when he could he it together. He held my hand (when I let him) and moved away from me when I needed him to get away from me lol.
