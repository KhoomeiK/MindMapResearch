NintendoSwitch,ffkatpn,t3_eu2gll,1580019756.0,"The Switch doesn't have the selling power of the Wii. As awesome and popular as the Switch is, the Wii was popular with the elderly which is a demographic the Switch doesn't reach.

What the Switch does have going for it, however, is merging the home console and portable console sales. Additionally, the Switch is seen as a supplimentary or periphery console to many gamers, who will pick one up in addition to their main console of choice.

So ultimately I think it will come down to how long Nintendo plans to support the console and how many revisions they'll put out in its lifetime. The Switch Life is a good example since it simultaneously grabbed a bunch of new consumers who wanted a cheaper portable option while also getting many Switch owners to buy a second travel Switch."

How do you feel about taking orders from someone you do not like, get along with or agree with? How do you feel about being used as a tool for people whos only interest is profiting from your service? 

These are all things the Military will do to you and will not tell you about up front. You will need to weigh all of these things against your conscious and determine if you're still willing to go through with it. You may not be deployed to a combat situation, but there's an equally good chance you may.

It's not all gloom and doom though. When not risking your life, it's great for your health. It builds a good foundation for your character. It instills order in your life. The things you learn in your service will stick with you for life. You will develop strong bonds with your fellow soldiers. 

It will have its ups and its downs. You will most likely encounter a lot of bullshit busywork during downtime. Basic training is hard (it's meant to break you down to reforge you). You will be forced to go on missions and deployments you don't want to. But you will also have fun. You will learn new things. You will be provided with basic living accomodations while being paid for it (unless you're an officer) which will ease the burden of rent and bills.

My advice to you as a potential recruit: Know what you're getting yourself into. The recruiters won't exactly lie to you, but they will omit a lot of information to make it seem more glamorous than it is. They will also lie to you. Get everything promised in writing (like a sign-on bonus) or you won't receive it. Know what job you want to take before you enlist. Don't accept alternatives or suggestions or you'll wind up stuck in a job you don't like. Oh, and save all of your money unless you absolutely need to spend it."

1. They do not accept that animals need to die in order to provide us with food; that it's possible to maintain a healthy diet without harming or killing animals in the process. A subset of this would be people who do not like the storage conditions of animals used for harvesting meat, usually with animals in horrendously cruel conditions. A fake-meat (imitation meat, lab meat, etc) substitute is a way of eating meat without any animal death or suffering.

2. They do not think that meat is healthy and that a plant-based diet is far healthier than one that consumes meat. A fake-meat substitute will be healthier for the body to consume, as it is usually made with a plant base. This most likely excludes lab-grown meat.

3. They do not like the taste or texture of meat. Some people just cannot stand certain tastes or textures, no matter how much other people may enjoy it. These people will most likely not consume fake-meat substitutes for the same reason they do not consume meat.
