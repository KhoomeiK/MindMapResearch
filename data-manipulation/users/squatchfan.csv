loveafterlockup,fczswmg,t1_fczqpeg,1578108058.0,"He's 21, but with the mental age of 17. His emotional maturity was stunted when he went to prison. No job, no prospect of a job. No responsibility. His wife has sex with him 5-10 times a day. He has no worries. Lacey provides for him. A 17yr old would buy alcohol if it were legal & drink like that in the morning. I'm not surprised by it. I'm surprised that Lacey thinks he is ready for fatherhood."
