It is why I think it is pointless to say that ""X nation did this bad thing here"" and ""Y nation did this good thing here"". Because the decisions of nations are made by the 0.001% at the top. Almost every human being just want to live their life peacefully. But conflict, strife and war is always forced upon us by the few sycophants on top.   
  
Saying that X country did this and Y country did that, is the same as saying that everyone in a country is equally guilty or innocent. It is an extreme black and white view on things, and has no anchor to the reality of the human condition."
AskReddit,ffpibue,t3_eucq64,1580095736.0,"1) Don't start studying if you aren't 100% sure if the job you are studying for is what you want. Either now, or later in life. At the very minimum. Study what the occupation you are studying for entails to learn what is boils down to for good or worse. You risk student debt ruining your life for jumping into studying just for the sake of studying something. Wait until you know who you are and what you want with life.  
  
  
2) Read up on the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost). Example. Say you are a guy who has been dating a girl for 6 years, from 18 to 24 years and you are getting bored of eachother, she being abusive, using you, or other negatives. **DO NOT JUSTIFY KEEP STAYING TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU HAVE STAYED TOGETHER FOR SO LONG**. This is the worst mistake both men and women do in relationships. They stick to a partner that isn't their SO because ""we have spent so much time together and all that time would be wasted if we break up"". Also **never** keep a partner based on dependency (like if you need your partner because of financial reasons etc.). You are destroying your life and theirs both. Sometimes break-ups are necessary and healthy.  
  
3) Save money and don't waste money needlessly. You buying an energy drink every day? Well, too bad. Now you are 40 and still can't afford an apartment because you wasted ""meaningless small sums"" on unnecessary luxuries all your life (this is me btw).   
  
4) Appreciate the small things in life. Don't take the sun on your face as you are sitting on a bench for granted. Take it in. Be **consciouss** of small good things in life. Don't be obsessed with meaningless stuff like money, status and power. You will never be happy if you do. A thousand gold bars in your bank isn't worth the emotional support of a good and TRUE friend."

Take a piece of clay and mold it into a square, then mold it into a ball, then mold it into a triangle. The square is the past, the mold the present, and the triangle the future. The universe has a set amount of energy, just like this figure has a set amount of clay. Say that we attempt time travel by adding a small green piece of clay into the mold, this represents you. You **CAN NOT** mold the clay ""back in time"" to a square, without **destroying** the clay that currently forms a triangle.  
    
Mass and energy can not exist in two places at once. Your present time is basically just the position of the matter and energy you exist in in relation to all other matter and energy currently.

Because if God punishes you for evil intent but not your actions, that means a person who means well can perform any amount of atrocities and still go to heaven.

Stoic philosophy is like stopping a hellish wildfire of depression, anguish, hopelessness and sorrow with a a still and peaceful winter. You will never burn again, but you will also never feel warmth. It is beautiful and serene, but your fiery passions fall from the tree of your soul like brittle autumn leaves never to return. In the lake of your mind you attempt look upon your reflection in the water. However the water is frozen. Beneath the ice are all things that used to worry you. They are gone now. The only reflection you now see is a blurred image upon the ice of a face that knows no sadness or pain, but also no passion or desire.   
  
Then a polar bear comes over and mauls you in the face with the absurdities of life as you enter an existential crisis and start bleeding questions all over the snow. As you start to lose blood you start seeing things that you never saw before. The polar bear then hands you a gun and whips out a gun for himself as the two of you start blasting the green flying frogs that descended from your insanity.

In fact - it makes more sense - not less, that a wise person would reject what we define as normal moral and ethical rules. Because the wise will find values and principles internally and not externally. Consider someone that follows religious laws, customs and traditions blindly. Unwise. No thought. No critical thinking. A person that realizes that morals and ethics are not universal but subjective and changing, could have a higher chance of rejecting social norms instead of embracing them.   
 
  
To put it in simpler terms. The sheep that realizes it can choose to stay a sheep or to transform into a wolf at will can either ignore his flock of sheep and leave them, stay to protect them as a guardian, or hunt them for food. It the eyes of the wolf - it can decide its own fate and any of these roads would be morally acceptable because the wolf has ascended the sheep and is therefore only accountable to his own consciousness of what is morally right.

Someone at work told me they ""lost"" their house in Spain. How? They had a vacation home in Spain. A house they bought and owned. Apparently some vagrants broke into their house and started living in it. Fucked up and illegal right? Well guess what - it gets worse. The police say they ""can't do anything"". It turns out that in Spain, even if you own a house and are paying for it (water, electricity etc.) vagrants can simply break in and move into it while you are not there and there's nothing you can do about it.   
  
I'd like to see someone try that in the US, the vagrants/home intruders would be in jail in no time if the house owner didn't off them himself. And the law would probably be on the home owner's side. I'm not from the US and I don't like the US legal system, but in cases like this I think the US legal system is better.  
  
Imagine a bunch of fucking homeless vagrants moving into your house while gone. And when contacting the authorities, you are told you have to still pay the bills but there's nothing you can do about the vagrants living in your house! It's fucking crazy.   
  
My opinions here are based on assuming what my work colleague said is true. So feel free to correct me if this is wrong. But if it is true, and combined with this story, I'm surprised Spain has laws at all.

conspiracy,ffdgiom,t3_et04ye,1579820386.0,"I ""feel"" it in my dreams. If any dream analysts have a lot of time to waste I'll share what I've been dreaming lately. I often have lucid dreams and these stuck out recently (the last year) from among the 20+ I've had:  
  
Disclaimer: No mental illnesses, no drug abuse, not religious (rather the opposite - cold and logical). 
 
  
1) A bright light (it wasn't nuclear, just a bright burning light) in my home town. I could see people running and screaming as the bright growing flash expanded from the center of my town. The rest of the dream was non-sensical. Broken bridge. I joined a gang in the devastated ruins of my home city. Walking through the forests.   
  
2) I was in a bus. Aware but unable to move. Had to fight for my consciousness / staying awake inside the dream. When I gained full lucid control, I saw the universe outside. Inside the bus - family members, strangers, etc. I willed myself outside it. There is a cosmic citadel of impossible geometrical shapes. I enter it. It is a maze. Not finding my way I will myself to the center of the labyrinth. There are mirrors inside, none reflect me. There is a woman cradling a baby. As I close in the child screams, and I see it has demonic eyes and teeth. I wake up from it, the scream was so loud and so long I could have sworn I still heard it as I woke up. I was hallucinating after waking up. Seeing the words (Synthesis error) on the walls of my room. Not a native english speaker so I had to look the word synthesis up. It means: ""the combination of components or elements to form a connected whole"". Still don't understand the dream or what it was supposed to mean.  
  
3) Just last week I dreamt I was in Hollywood. But the Hollywood sign said ""Olderwood"" or ""Elderwood"" or something instead of Hollywood which confused me. Strangely the place wasn't bright or colorful. It was overgrown with plants and in darkness. I tried inquiring in my dream what was going on. When I did I felt a hostile entity try to strangle me with my umbilical cord.   

4) I'm in a bus (again). Lucid (so aware) but not in control. I notice the people around me not looking like people at all. They look like weird humans. The woman driving the bus is mad at them for making so much noise. So she walks back into the bus to shout at them. Her intent is clear. However they then (me included) raise a huge painting. In the painting, her face appears. This seems to frighten her - so she backs up. What made this dream so horridly unsettling was that these people were fucking creepy (as in - something was wrong with them but I couldn't tell what). And I **WAS** one of them. Inside his head. When I see my reflection in the window, I have their face. And the person I'm inside knows I'm there but says nothing.  
  
5) There are people looking at a black obelisk. When it's my turn to touch it I live an entire life in another person's body. He is a french wine farmer. His life was hard work. He raised a family. At his dying day I wake up. I'm back at the black obelisk. A lifetime had passed in my mind, but only a moment in ""real"" time. The other figures take their turns touching the black obelisk. Behind me is a gigantic living tree. Eldritch horror style. With gazing giant eyes hanging from its branches. It peers up to the universe above. I feel the eyes on me even if I can't see them looking at me. It is my time to touch the obelisk again. But I'm no longer there, I'm on a small island with an infinite ocean of silvery water surrounding me. Orange sky, yellow grass. The ancient tree is looking at me with my own imagination. 
  
Unfortunately the words describing these dreams feel dull in comparison to the real thing. Because the emotional states in these dreams are more wonderful and terrifying than words can describe them. When I dream it feels as if what I feel has more weight than what I see.

For example another attack after Haven where the best scenario if you played all your cards right would only be one companion dying for example.   
  
With the obtaining of power for the Inquisition, I really felt there was a missed opportunity here to utilize that more somewhat like in the suicide mission in ME2. Where you had to make your companions take charge of defending areas from corypheus, and your overall inquisition power points could have been spent to aid in that.  
  
As an example. A story interlude could be Corypheus massing an attack. You have 10 flags around haven (war table). You choose companions and utilize your agents and power to fortify these while personally commanding one of the points. This would have given the power mechanic more use in the story. As in - if you don't have enough you could end up with a bad ending akin to ME2 where multiple companions die or other losses."
dragonage,ff38byb,t1_ff33ibh,1579536079.0,"Perfectly fine that we disagree. Just thought I'd explain where I'm coming from here with all this.   
  
I think that in regards to the context of the overall dragon age story and lore his character is awesome. In him being an immortal Tevinter magister who was at the heart of the most mysterious and biggest lore point in the setting, the intrusion upon the black city. I've played a thousand video games and IMO he is among the coolest and most memorable among them, up there with Sephiroth, Kefka and Dagoth Ur. Though admittedly maybe you'd disagree with them being placed so high as well.  
  
I'm a sucker for villains who has deep lore ties and has such an omni-presence and feel in the game. Villains who you aren't facing directly, but their influence is felt in the world as you chase them. Part of what made Sephiroth one of the biggest villains ever for me wasn't his ""cool factor"" for example. But the mystery around him and the fact we were chasing him as an entity in the game world that eluded you.   
  
Personally I think the depth isn't lacking in Corypheus, rather, Bioware failed to reveal that depth. I consider it an error in writing and not an error in character."

I'm not from the US and I used to always stand by the quote ""The blade itself incites to deeds of violence"" looking at the number of gun related deaths in the US. My opinion was always that the US needs to remove gun ownership from civilians because it leads to so much unnecessary death.  
  
But looking at how utterly and fully corrupt the US government is today. Looking at the blatant power abuse of police in the US and how many (and how easily) psychopaths joins the police force there. My view kinda changed. Because if the people no longer has the right to bear arms, then a justified revolt and protection against the system that is supposed to stand with and not against the people could never happen even if it was needed.  
  
The argument against it again, would be that armed civilians could never actually do anything against the brainwashed military and police forces, so that any armed revolution would only lead to civilian casualties by the corrupt elite.  
  
So as someone not from the US the issue of gun ownership is certainly not as easy as I once thought. On one side, having a gun could easily ruin 2 lives in a heated conflict. Instead of that conflict being cooled down. On the other side, not having a gun if you are being targeted by the corrupt means you can't defend yourself against unrighteous action.   
   
So my opinion today is basically that there is no winning choice for civilians whether you have the right to own a gun or not."
