I should clarify that I've never experienced any severe trauma (rape, assaults) and don't have PTSD. I don't even know anyone that's experienced a severe trauma that could have affected me second hand by knowing it happened to them. Which is why I'm frustrated i have these horrible dreams. I'm pretty stable right now on my meds, have a very strict routine i follow. The only thing fucked up I my dreams and they usually get bad like this when I'm manic. But I'm not (don't think i am anyway lol). I'm in Texas so it's a not on marijuana, and I've actually stopped using it because the THC in some strands made me hallucinate or it just didn't get me high because of the meds. I may have to try CBD tinctures again and see if that helps. I'm going to seek therapy for unrelated reasons but since it was brought up, I'll talk about this issue during sessions."
bipolar,fdnbdc6,t3_em7qwf,1578582111.0,"I am very undecided about whether or not I would have my own bio children. The likelihood for my kid would be a little higher to get any mental health disorder just because it runs in my family. The only plus that I've come up with so far (and is only 1 against a list of many, many cons) is that we would be the best person to help our kid if they did develop a mental health disorder, because we experience it ourselves. There's also the greater, more likely chance, as someone else mentioned, that our bio children may not develop bipolar disorder. However, it just depends on your family history. I think for every immediate relative with bipolar disorder or another mental health disorder (siblings or parents) it increases the likelihood of developing it by 10%. Don't quote me on that though. I just know for me and my family history, my bio children developing a mental health disorder id higher than the general population, not to mention all the effects of being pregnant, post partum depression and more causing issues not only within myself, but the baby I'd be carrying. I think it would be a very big risk for me to carry a child. I've always considered adoption, too. There are a lot of kids that need homes and a loving family, and I know I could decide when me and my partner are ready."
bipolar,fc70e1q,t3_eggz1e,1577494186.0,"Has your psych discussed getting genetic testing done? My doc talked to me about Genesight (Idk if your doctor will have the same thing or some variation of it) but it looks at your DNA markers and based on that, generates a report of the medications that will work best for you and what won't work. It's got a green box, yellow box, and red box-- Green is good for you, yellow is maybe, and red is what won't work at all.  


It can cost a bit but they won't charge until you know if you qualify for a payment plan or to not have to pay anything at all, and sometimes insurance can cover a bit of it, too. The only thing I noticed was there was one medication I did try that didn't work at all (Risperdal) in the green zone, but I was also taking it in combo with Lithium, which unsurprisingly does not show up in these genetic tests. But I think now it will save me a lot of time and trouble switching or trying meds because we can just look at the report and know what is theoretically supposed to work and not waste time prescribing stuff that won't. I hope this kind of helps, or maybe it can be something you talk with your doc about so you don't feel like you're being thrown prescriptions with no rhyme or reason. It can really add up even with those prescription cards."
bipolar,fc6zipm,t3_eggbzr,1577493538.0,Hey there-- same boat as you with starting Vraylar. I think I'd seen somewhere else that someone took it at night-- but according to my doc it's better to take it in the morning because it can make you restless? Amongst other things. I hope it helps you out! That's the only advice I thought to share that could maybe help. I guess it's a newer drug so there's not much out there about it yet?
bipolar,fc6zbcp,t3_eg7hvb,1577493387.0,This is great news! Congrats and please keep at it!
bipolar,fc6z5ab,t3_egixzc,1577493263.0,"See everyone apparently has a bad time on Seroquel, and it's been the best medication so far and actually helped me remain (mostly) stable. I still have breakthrough symptoms where my mood is affected for like 2-3 days so I got Vraylar added as a supplement. I wonder why it's got bad side effects for what seems like the majority of people. It's weird when I see people here post that they're on like 25mg or so because I'm on 400mg and still have some symptoms D:"
bipolar,f5j6fiq,t3_dnml4d,1572221915.0,"Hey there. One thing that's helped me is going to the bank and withdrawing cash for the pay period. I started doing this while I was stable so that when I'm in a mood episode, I've already got cash there with me. Get like $40-60 (or whoever much you'd typically spend on necessities) and stretch that for the two weeks until your next paycheck. Use your cards to pay bills only or for emergency needs (car parts, doctors appointments, medication). If you are prone to using your cards to shop and buying online, just take them out of your wallet completely. Keep them in a separate place until you need to go get more cash. Hopefully the hassle of having to drive to the bank all the time, or getting up to go get your cards where you stashed them is enough of an obstacle to somewhat curb your spending. This has really helped me out. If you go out for the day and see you physically only have limited cash, you're less likely to have this urge to spend it all, especially if you're trying to get groceries or gas. Say you wanna withdraw $100. Give yourself $60 for necessities and $40 for throwaway stuff like clothes, fast food or going out. That's $20 a week for leisure and $60 to get gas and groceries and anything else you might need immediately. The important thing is to solidify the habit when you're stable so that when you start getting elevated it's part of your routine. Good luck!!! 

pS sometimes you just do whatever the hell you want either way if you're manic. I'm telling you all of this yet failed to follow my own advice. I went over my credit card limit of $500 and spent about $400 of my checkings account last week on clothes lmao so sometimes dumb shit just happens. But good luck!!! I hope you can reign I some of the spending. Even choosing to spend $20 less a week is an improvement and saves up over a month."
