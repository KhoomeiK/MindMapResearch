""Just following orders"" is ALWAYS a cop out. Have I been in that dire of a situation? No. Have I been in a much less life and death situation when I was in a click in school and someone outside of that click was being picked on for their skin color and I stepped up and (thankfully!!!) that started others to step up and shut it down? Yes. Could it have gotten me a butt kicking if those others hadn't stepped up? Probably.

CERTAINLY NOT LIFE AND DEATH and NOWHERE NEAR what many people have been faced with. I hope I am NEVER faced with that decision and my greatest respect for the men and women and children that have stood up to tyranny over the years.
