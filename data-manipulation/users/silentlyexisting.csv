SuicideWatch,femg6k6,t3_epwt7b,1579253821.0,Somebody finally put it into the right words... I feel you 100% on this. I’m right there too....
SuicideWatch,femccyf,t3_ept7vg,1579248374.0,"Soo.. what do you do when you have No friends, no one who truly cares.. I attempted just last month in December.. people thought I did it I got maybe 2 messages out of the 50-60 people I had on social media and grew up with.. they both said how much they wish they could’ve been there for me, how they could’ve treated me better, wish they had a chance to treat me better... I’m still here. They hurt me one last time & now are no where to be found & I still want to die everyday..."
SuicideWatch,fem0gud,t1_fem0077,1579235813.0,"True.. not my personal question I just seen it and kind of agreed with it. Maybe I shouldn’t say cancer patients but I feel like mentally ill people should have a right to decide when to give up, maybe I’m only thinking this way because of the reasons you stated above, but I feel like there should be a test or something . just feel like people expect mentally ill people to get passed it no matter what because it doesn’t seem so “extreme” or “severe”"
