On my etrade account there hasn’t been a single contract for tsla under 7k for over a month “honestly I think it’s closer to 9k) I keep seeing these guys out there making tsla play with a couple hundred bucks. I only have a couple grand, but I’ve literally not bought anything for tsla for almost two months of periodically checking it out because I thought I couldn’t afford it. How tf are people trading tsla contract without spending 10k on them? Pls halp"

wallstreetbets,fgle2fn,t1_fgk0bz6,1580892972.0,"Are you really spending $15 or 1500 to buy the contract? On etrade any contract within a $200 variance is $9-10k. I have 5k I could trade this with but that’s not even enough from what I see on my etrade brokerage. Do I need a different broker or something. I feel like an idiot after watching tsla on my watchlist for over a month, just for shits and giggles. I feel like I somehow could’ve traded some options with even 3k from what I read on here sometimes."

There’s a slew of trading techniques that mitigate risk while providing a high potential for a limited profit return. I know next to nothing compared to some people on here, but making option spreads with a 70% possibility of being profitable sounds like way better odds than playing black jack or roulette."

I’m no doctorate but in my Econ classes I had a couple chapters that referenced SS. There’s actually a website you can see their ledger. It’s also back by USA investment trust funds with apy’s we’ll never have access to. Coupled with the never ending inflow of revenue; Unless America is literally wiped off of the face of the earth, SS will continue to profit and distribute funds for fucking centuries. I’m sure there’s some weekend warriors that feel otherwise, but I’m going trust my Econ doctorate instructor with over 15 years or so of exp, and of course the obvious influx of funds and investment returns.
