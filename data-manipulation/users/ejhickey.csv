vancouver,ffq2oh2,t1_ffp657i,1580117078.0,"Thank you for the links. First about drivers sleeping in their cars. The Guardian article cherry picked some drivers who have made the choice to drive for Uber even though they live a long distance from SF making a trip home impractical.  However, Uber is not forcing them to drive for them.  They are making that choice.  

A more complete picture of Uber drivers is presented here  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-23/when-their-shifts-end-uber-drivers-set-up-camp-in-parking-lots-across-the-u-s
This article says that only some drivers do this and ""The vast majority of Uber’s full-time drivers return home to their beds at the end of a day’s work. ""    

and from the same article one driver says 

""“I signed up for this because I am my boss. I kind of own the business. I have the freedom and that’s a beautiful thing,” he said, while laying out his sleeping bag in the back seat of his Toyota Prius, “This job is not for everyone. Don’t get it twisted,” he said. “These labor advocates, they don’t know what it’s like to be a driver. They think we’re not being treated right, but I’m happy. If I didn’t like it, I would do something else.”"

True .  I live a city with Uber and Lyft.  When it is easier to use a taxi, I use a taxi .  When it is easier to order Uber , I use Uber.  BTW, since the rise of ride sharing, taxi service got a LOT better.  Note : some taxi drivers drive for Uber on the side.

One more thing:  when I take my car in for service, my dealer will order and pay for an Uber ride either back home , my office or a shopping center. When my car is ready , I just call them and they send an Uber to where I want to be picked up.  Just one example of the possibilities that ride sharing opens up."

Even if the cost was the same , the nice part of Uber is being able to order a ride and having it show up in 5 minutes , a driver who knows the roads, a clean car, knowing the identity of your drivers and his or her ratings , being able to give feedback about the quality of your experience to a company that will listen and to other Uber users.

This is not our fight.  for one thing , we have been fighting so many ""wars"" for the past few decades and spent so much money and lives doing it , that we can't afford another one.  Second,  why is it in our interest to defend Ukraine?   We have no treaty with them.  You say it is in the interest of ""freedom"".  I say I have heard that Bullshit argument for decades and it is a hollow one .  The US has been fighting for ""freedom"" in Vietnam, Iraq , Afghanistan, Syria and more places than I can count and where has it gotten us?  Just a lot of dead and wounded  and deeper in debt.  How is Afghanistan going ? Iraq?    We have troops stationed in over 150 countries around the world.   We just had a few more killed in Africa the other day and one of them was a kid from my area in Chicago.  His parents are heartbroken.  Do you want to send more American boys to die in Ukraine because that is what we are heading for if we continue to send military aid there.    If you want to fight the Russians in Ukraine , saddle up and get your butt over there and volunteer for their army.  As for me , I vote for not sending any money , weapons or troops there ."

He wants more war.   I mean this is how the US gets into undeclared wars around the world .
