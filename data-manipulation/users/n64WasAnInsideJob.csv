FindMeADistro,fepf2f0,t1_feodzz8,1579318901.0,"Truth be told, the page you linked called ""Fedora is a testbed"" a myth, then pretty much confirmed it was in the following paragraphs, by pretending that ""testbed for RHEL == unstable"", which is obviously a logical fallacy, because Arch rolling could be considered a testbed for Manjaro, and is not unstable.

You're correct that I don't like either, but that's because I'm an anti-systemd zealot first and foremost, and charge extra to support systemd-based distros professionally (hazard pay - I'm allergic to douchebags like Poettering/Seivers/Pennington). My opinion should be taken with that appropriate helping of salt. That said, my constructive suggestion would be to learn the three trending directions of linux today: the GNU route (Parabola GNU/Linux or GNU Guix), the systemd route (Fedora/Manjaro), and the bsd-ish route (gentoo, void). 

[PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD) is the scripting template for source or binary packages in Arch. IMO it's one of the nicest and easiest experiences for creating new packages (even better than Gentoo, honestly), especially when you compare it to making a new rpm or even a deb. 

I'm not sure honestly what the issue is, but every time I spin-up a CentOS, RHEL, or Fedora instance, it doesn't take more than 3 months for something laughably terrible to happen to it during either an automatic update, requiring automatic intervention. In addition, I find myself trying to actively *avoid* RPM's when I can, because often building from source will solve weird idiosyncrasies created by Fedora/RH's patchsets. Best I can suggest is try to make a pkgbuild in Arch/Manjaro, and a (src and binary) rpm, and see which you enjoy doing more.

All of which is to say ""Fedora definitely ain't for me, but if it's for you, good on you. Don't feel like you're missing out because Manjaro might not fit."""

The reason is because you don't really need init getting in your way, and Alpine works great with just a /linuxrc file handling PID1 and booting your services. Void uses runit, which is also ridiculously small.

Basically, you should be configuring your kernel as a monolithic entity (no modules) so it takes no time to boot, then keeping init simple so it only starts what you need for the app, then having the app automatically start. I've done something similar with an ARM board running Angstrom Linux back in the day, based off [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2LRy_JIDY) \([here are the slides](https://elinux.org/images/9/97/Boot_one_second_altenberg.pdf)\).

When you don't have to open 30 applications just to play your games, it feels really really nice. I find myself playing Tekken Tag Tournament just as much as I play Street Fighter IV nowadays. And Tales of Vesperia sits alongside Tales of Phantasia, and encourages me to play through the entire series. Gaming on Linux, thanks to Lutris, is a *whole other level* for gamers."
