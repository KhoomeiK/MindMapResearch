todayilearned,ffmngj0,t1_fflvyt8,1580056931.0,"Ugh. So gross. I swear I am healthier at my current job because I am at the front desk and not in a cube farm or open plan. Even with various coworkers and customers and vendors popping in all day, I feel my exposure is way less."
todayilearned,ffmn8tw,t1_fflranf,1580056847.0,Yes. So many different strengths and personalities and they want everyone to fit in the same box.
todayilearned,ffmm7qs,t1_ffmb7fc,1580056582.0,It is every kids dream when we are in grade school and then in the working world it is like oh hell no. What an ass. These companies are clueless about workplace culture.
todayilearned,ffmlgyp,t1_ffmh32s,1580056285.0,"Thank you for being like this. Treating your staff like competent adults! We have a lot of people at my company that have the option to work from home at least one day a week, across many departments. We have full time remote people too, who are able to live out of state in lower COL areas near family, etc.. My coworkers work HARD. They are taking all the calls and responding to emails and on top of their shit. If they arent, they are back in the office full time until things change. Some folks even have flex schedules of 4/10s, or working swing shift till 10 pm. I love that our company offers this. Keep your people happy and they will do good work. And thank god we have cubicles and no open office bullshit."
Marriage,ffk4zx7,t3_etr10d,1580016047.0,"We do! Its something fun to think about. Even if we don't do a lot, we acknowledge it and it makes us smile. We met on September 9th and chose July 9th for our wedding date. Now we joke all future children and home purchases etc must occur on the ninth of a month lol.

ETA: my aunt and uncle do this too and I always got a kick out of it. Every Thanksgiving they say '44 years together, 40 married'. Lovely. And I had a former boss who would always take his wife out to celebrate their first date. They met in college and three kids later they are still wild about each other. Both those couples showed me how important it is to do those little things in relationships and acknowledge your partner."
namenerds,ffji33h,t1_ffie10n,1579998691.0,We have a family member who did this. First name is a traditional Greek name and middle name is Jack. Boy has always gone by Jack. I get wanting to honor the family and all that but how annoying for him to explain every school year. I am sure when he hits the working world only HR will see his full name and he will go by Jack. I suspect several adults I know use this method.
povertyfinance,fffkxc1,t1_ffcz56x,1579886190.0,Yup! My mom has been divorced a long time and she is open to dating I think but not sharing living space or finances. Especially if a man is supporting kids or grandkids still. Good on him but not her bag.
povertyfinance,fffkik8,t1_ffe643i,1579885937.0,"Word. I know lovely heart warming stories of older folks marrying in their 70s and beyond. Nah girl! I will date and keep my own damn house and finances and the men can do the same. I think that is why older men often remarry or find a long term gal, and widowed ladies are often content to be on their own after a lifetime of caring for others."
minimalism,ffebgle,t1_ffd2bmv,1579842125.0,Beautifully said
minimalism,ffeb49d,t3_esv04q,1579841821.0,"Very well said. You articulated so many things I sort of pondered. What I value is not necessarily what others will value. My husband buys old media collections to resell on ebay. People spend years collecting books or movies, only to have those collections sold for pennies after they pass. My husband and his dad have quite a collection of media too and I often think how that will be sold for pennies after we are all gone. If we have kids I want to tell them to please unburden themselves of our crap - I will even set up money so they can pay people to haul it away or something! My attachment to objects wont matter when I am gone."
Fashion_Design,ffbbjak,t3_esitrt,1579758591.0,Super fun and creative!
AskReddit,ff648y5,t3_ero8mj,1579618740.0,"I think she would be really happy I married a good man who is kind to everyone and treats me well and makes me laugh. She would be surprised I am not a professional writer or have some other cool career. And she would probably be really confused why I am trying to have kids as I am pushing 40. She would be relieved to know I got through middle school and did just fine in the world after all, even though everyone else seems to be more fun and interesting and more with it. Turns out 13 year old me is the mellow pal who is up to try most anything but is finding her place in the world and is happy to have a few genuine friends who really love her."
AskWomen,fefu3gf,t1_fef717j,1579065242.0,Ah this makes so much sense now. I am grateful we have cubicles. A more open plan would be rough.

femalefashionadvice,fdx67k6,t3_emwxtv,1578765703.0,"Thank you for posting this. I have considered doing this and never got around to it. It always sounded intimidating. I am not a fan of shopping anyway. I am really glad you found some pieces and hope the new job is stellar! 

I am in the Seattle area, where Nordstrom was founded. People here definitely have a heart on for Nordy's here. I never shop there because it feels to expensive for me, although I may not have looked for less expensive things. I am sad to hear from former employees the employees aren't treated well and the clothing quality is changing. Lots of folks enjoy the cafe for lunch and some stores even have a full bar right on the sales floor. It is a hoot and a different kind of experience. Maybe that is what people like?"
AskFeminists,fdx498k,t3_en7n8k,1578765166.0,"I heard about this the past few weeks. Took a long look at the conference's (not so grammatically great) website after your post today. Wowza. I am curious how many will attend. I jokingly asked my husband if we should go, so I could learn to be submissive and he can grow his dominance. He jokingly said yes and immediately ordered me to get up and start my day. It worked! Since I am still in bed posting on Reddit lol. Poor hubs has a long road ahead of him"
happycowgifs,fdcqvf9,t3_ekeoe5,1578281787.0,She is COL: Cow On Lap. Very important to not move lest she disturb the darling!
TrueOffMyChest,fct4kvu,t1_fcsy5uw,1577932719.0,Jesus that is awful.
JUSTNOMIL,fct4br5,t1_fcropgz,1577932536.0,Excellent wording! Good advice
science,fcrvak6,t1_fcrneas,1577907093.0,Good on you and the comment above! My friend did this with her parents original wedding rings (parents still married I think they upgraded their jewelry at some point). Very symbolic and it was wonderful to use stones that were already in the world.
