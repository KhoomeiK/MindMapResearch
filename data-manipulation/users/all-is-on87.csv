LifeProTips,fdsx9an,t1_fdrju3m,1578709129.0,"First off, I would try to simply establish a rapport with him. Greet him every time you see him, introduce yourself and let him know if he needs anything just ask and you’ll try to help. Don’t go in guns blazing trying to change their world. Just like any other person, trust needs to be built. You can comment on observations such as, “Hey, I noticed your coat is ripped is there anything I can do to help?”. 

Most importantly, treat homeless individuals with dignity, respect and empathy. They are human beings just like us and any one of us could find ourselves I their situation in a heartbeat. Thanks for being a kind soul."
