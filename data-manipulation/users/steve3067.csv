DestroyedTanks,ffgmm89,t1_ffg7vun,1579909756.0,My apologies. November is. correct. However in front line manpower the Germans had about a million more men 3.8 to 2.9. The Soviets also had about 2 million men in close reserve. The Soviets outnumbered the Germans almost 3-1 in tanks and 2-1 in aircraft.
DestroyedTanks,fff7rpq,t1_fff5bpu,1579877846.0,In Oct of 42 they would have been attacking. The reality is that if the Germans had a 1 to 1 ratio in men and equipment with the Soviets the outcome of the war might have been a lot different. I think that the kill ratio on tanks alone was like 10-1.

iamatotalpieceofshit,feefron,t3_eoiybu,1579032851.0,"Forget about the CEO he had nothing to do with this. He does not make operational decisions at Tim’s. 
Here is my question to you. Let’s say it takes 500 hours a week to run a Tim’s 24 hours with 3 people per shift. At $11.60 per hour that’s $5,800 per week in staff costs. At $14 an hour it’s $7000 per week for a difference of $1200 per week. So you’re suggesting that the owners should take a monthly pay cut of $4800? That does not sound reasonable. 
He has three options 1. Reduce hours by 342 a month and screw people out of pay. 2. Fire the equivalent of 8 full time people. 3. Take away paid breaks and lunches which are a perk and not law and everyone keeps their jobs and hours. You tell me what’s best. 
Tim’s owners are not rich people who bought a franchise to let someone run it and then just reap the rewards they work hard at it and they work more than 40 hours a week to do it."
iamatotalpieceofshit,feees3d,t1_fedup4h,1579032263.0,It was Jan 1 2018 my apologies. It went from $11.60 to $14.
iamatotalpieceofshit,feeekre,t1_fedzon5,1579032143.0,No. Wynn gave the first increase. Ford postponed the second one.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fedu5bz,t1_fedi07k,1579019949.0,"Wynn was the one who made the c
Increase."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fedu0zt,t1_feddn6h,1579019877.0,That’s not true at all. You adjust your staff requirements to the cost of doing business. The other option for Tim’s owners would have been layoffs. They chose to keep the jobs and meet the legal requirements for breaks instead.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fedtq67,t1_fedt0wa,1579019695.0,The increase was in 2017. Another one was planned but Ford cancelled it for now.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fedtnrb,t1_fedg55w,1579019653.0,"Great conversation everyone. The reality is, in Ontario and it’s similar in most of Canada breaks are unpaid. If the employer chooses to do so that is up to them. Tim’s owners for the most part chose to do this until the wage hike. If the government had of phased in the pay raises then the breaks probably stay paid. 
The other trickle down on the spike in wages was job loss. My son lost his job because his company cut back staff to accommodate the hike. 
I think that everyone deserves a living wage but getting there all at once is a huge burden on the business owners."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fedt0vz,t1_fedhdg4,1579019266.0,You are absolutely correct.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fedcbuw,t1_fed5t3m,1579007417.0,He’s not at fault at all. It’s a combination of a wage hike of 25% overnight and owners who were trying to maintain their profit margins.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fedbtt7,t1_fed55w6,1579006962.0,You won’t. The store owners decide if breaks are paid or not. Not the corporate office.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fedbrsu,t1_fedb5ep,1579006908.0,It should not be shared because it’s not right. The store owners chose whether or not to pay for breaks not this man. The post is a lie.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fedbnp0,t1_fed1jye,1579006803.0,"Let’s be clear here. Tim Hortons corporate did not cut the breaks when the min wage went up. The store owners did to save money. 
The law is that for every 4 hours you work you get one paid 15 min break un paid. For every 8 hours you add one unpaid 30 min lunch. 
The store owners used to cover these costs. Now in order to save money they are not. 
The min wage jumped over $2 overnight. Many franchises had difficulty covering this. 
BTW it went up to over $15 if you’re 18 or older. 
While I agree that 25 million a year is way to much for any exec to earn the poster is not telling the truth here. This man does not make decisions on breaks the store owners do."

Both Moving Pictures and Signals are much better albums. I think that you could argue Power Windows was better especially if you like that they went back to a bit harder rock on some tracks. Hold Your Fire annoyed me a little bit. It just seemed to pander to the style of the times rather than what I loved Rush for.

todayilearned,fctx7e2,t1_fct3ban,1577964104.0,"Rommel didn’t have much choice. Yes his supply lines were an issue. The greater issue was the lack of support because most of the war effort was going towards Russia. His next biggest issue was an Italian army that was totally incapable of fighting a war. They had terrible leadership and equipment and simply didn’t want to be there. 
It took Montgomery almost 3 weeks to break the lines at El Alamein with one of the largest numerical superiorities of WW2. 
It took him the same amount of time to take Caen under similar circumstances and his plan for Market Garden was terribly flawed and he ignored every sign that the Germans in the area were stronger than he thought. 
Montgomery liked set piece battles and did not react well to the fluid situations that arrive right after the first shots were fired. He was a great organizer and politician though."

He said he regretted not pushing back and going anyway for the rest of his life. He did not say any of the things in this meme. Jimmy Stewart and Clark Gable were both pulled out of combat roles shortly after they entered to keep them safe. Jimmy Stewart was a bomber pilot Clark Gable was a gunner in a bomber. 

John Ford was never in combat. He was a director of war effort films. He was in some war zones but he was never in any real danger. Along with Huston, Wyler, Stevens and Capra they directed most of the US propaganda films as members of the army, navy and air corps. There is a great Netflix documentary on the 5 of them."
