NoStupidQuestions,ffpm43x,t3_euid6r,1580098452.0,"As long as it’s been kept dry and out of the heat, it should be fine."
NoStupidQuestions,ffplfvf,t3_eugqs1,1580097959.0,"They pay for tips. Some people might be privy to info that would be unethical for them to reveal, so they might call TMZ and sell that info. Ex: people in law enforcement or people that work at hospitals."
AnimalsBeingJerks,ffpi4gf,t1_ffo9fsg,1580095603.0,"I have a couple of empty boxes for my cats, too. Cats are like little kids: they’d rather play with the empty boxes than the toys."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffnq3aj,t3_etlta5,1580069221.0,"If this was Ensley kissing Jenelle, people would be losing their shit because Jenelle would be making the photo “all about herself.”"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffnppy9,t3_eu1df1,1580069067.0,So?
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffnoa3f,t1_ffnc0kn,1580068480.0,"Some assume that they have a lot of free time, but that’s just an assumption. We don’t know how they spend every waking moment of their lives."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffnnx1s,t3_eua238,1580068331.0,"Does MTV provide group healthcare to the ladies and their families? If not, they must pay for their own private plan (if they can’t be covered by a spouse). The cost of a private plan is higher than group insurance and usually does not cover as many resources. So, technically, they do not automatically have any more access to resources than anyone else, unless they pay for the coverage or pay cash."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffnecj2,t1_ffmfmwy,1580064843.0,Congrats!
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffne9en,t1_ffmstsa,1580064808.0,Good luck!
todayilearned,ffmgw0i,t3_etwdn3,1580054506.0,McDonald’s trying to force me to self order and check out a single cup of black coffee was the last straw for me.
todayilearned,ffmdnsn,t1_ffl6oi0,1580053020.0,It is an acceptable substitution for cow milk.
entertainment,ffmby4a,t3_eu5iw1,1580052083.0,Did not expect that. I loved that show when I was a kid.
vanderpumprules,ffmangt,t1_ffj6o29,1580051423.0,Agree. Not smoking and wearing sunscreen is a far better beauty regime.
vanderpumprules,ffma9dm,t1_ffj6k2n,1580051343.0,"I’m in my 40’s now, and the only wrinkles that I have are in my forehead (like the kind you get from furrowing). They are not very noticeable, but I can feel them. I imagine preventative Botox could have helped with this."
vanderpumprules,ffma1lk,t1_ffj6vr3,1580051206.0,"I’ve gotten Botox for migraines a couple of times (but never cosmetically). It was about 30 shots in the face, neck, head, and shoulders. It did not feel good at all. It worked okay, but it did not completely stop my migraines."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffm5uym,t1_ffjqmxd,1580049041.0,"The state will do them for free if she applies for any assistance, I’m pretty sure. But for the price of a couple boxes of hair dye, she could buy one over the counter at the drugstore."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffm5o00,t3_ettpyw,1580048887.0,"So, actually she does not know who the baby’s father is. What is her child going to think about this in the future?"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffm5hwc,t1_ffk3pmi,1580048755.0,"That seems like an awfully high return rate. And even if it is an average, that means that some perform better and some perform worse. At Barbara’s age, she would be advised not to invest aggressively since she is close to retirement age. She would earn far less return. Doubtful that she has millions."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffm3jn2,t1_ffk015r,1580047941.0,Wasn’t Barbara living with someone when the show started? Pretty sure he had an income. Then she started getting paid by MTV. Barb did not raise 3 children alone solely on a Walmart paycheck.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffm0n1s,t1_ffltukm,1580046712.0,She wouldn’t know anymore than anyone else would. At least I don’t she why she would.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffm0cn0,t1_fflrb78,1580046537.0,That’s a really good idea. I like it.
UnethicalLifeProTips,ffk0us0,t3_etwhjm,1580012375.0,You’re homeowners’ insurance would likely have to cover losses like this.
BravoRealHousewives,ffjzszu,t3_eu126b,1580011495.0,He is dreadful.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffjmqf9,t1_ffht4hq,1580001824.0,I was answering the above person’s questions. I wasn’t talking about any rings or apartment visits.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffjdczh,t3_etti91,1579995898.0,Why does she look like an elf?
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffjci1k,t1_ffjbax0,1579995400.0,That is absolutely mind boggling that none of these people involved can be bothered to take a paternity test.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffjcbme,t3_ettpyw,1579995302.0,"Yeah, she’s pretty dumbbb."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffjbyg7,t1_ffit5td,1579995087.0,He certainly seems to be. Not bad looking either.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffj8vlg,t3_etrrlu,1579993209.0,Cute pic. Watson is adorable.
vanderpumprules,ffi2sar,t3_etd7iw,1579963405.0,This is terrible. Lala sounds anguished on this track.
vanderpumprules,ffi2bbq,t3_etkgdt,1579963000.0,Her breasts are way too big for her frame. She looks like she’s aching for a reduction.
vanderpumprules,ffi27gc,t1_ffhw89r,1579962904.0,"I think that they should break up, too."
vanderpumprules,ffi2479,t1_ffh7oi3,1579962824.0,"If he wants to get married, then he should probably move on from Ariana."
mainecoons,ffhex36,t3_etlrwh,1579932400.0,I remember when mine was that little. She was an absolute menace!
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffhe3s4,t1_ffgy2zh,1579931517.0,Doctors and nurses have become addicts and are allowed to keep their licenses after going to rehab.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffhdxkf,t1_ffgwmvm,1579931331.0,That is amazing. They had quit offering Latin by the time I got old enough to take it in high school. That is a shame.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffhdjfa,t1_ffhax0j,1579930908.0,"According to the post she is planning on divorcing him, and she would like to return to tv but has no plans."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffhdgt1,t3_etjj31,1579930832.0,"Thanks for the synopsis, OP. There is still hope for Jenelle."

Futurology,ffgwb99,t1_fffwtjq,1579916703.0,"We have blinking yellow turn signals that are super helpful. As long as no traffic is approaching, you can make left hand turns. This way the turn lanes don’t end up congesting traffic."
Futurology,ffgw40w,t3_eteahl,1579916557.0,"Meanwhile, my city is eliminating so many lanes of traffic to add bike lanes. Bike lanes are nice and all, but they have added so many in areas that are never, ever used. They put them in such random places where no bicycle traffic exists at all."

memphis,ffgbprg,t1_ffg08o7,1579902717.0,FedEx package handler jobs are part time.
holdmycosmo,ffg957m,t3_es6jh7,1579901139.0,Oof! That’s going to leave a mark.
BravoRealHousewives,ffg6sxr,t1_ffg1jya,1579899691.0,She definitely always seems to be on a steady diet of uppers and alcohol.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffg477a,t1_ffg3wk3,1579898095.0,That’s totally not true.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffg3dws,t1_fffm6li,1579897591.0,"The post is about Jenelle, so it kinda draws attention to Jenelle. Jenelle did not post it here herself."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fffq0at,t3_et2fvy,1579889295.0,This seems reasonable to me. She’s obviously very fit and knows what she’s doing.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fffoo47,t1_fffenti,1579888468.0,"I’m from the South, too. And I totally identify with your statement."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fffoj3n,t1_fffbiwe,1579888381.0,I agree with you 100%.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fffodte,t1_fffdtir,1579888292.0,Kail definitely likes to control the narrative.
