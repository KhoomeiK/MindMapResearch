PS4,fehdm3e,t1_fehc89g,1579114374.0,"We're talking about a digital service. Do you expect to have to repurchase apps when Apple releases the next iPhone? When people purchased digital games for PS3, I'd be shocked if the vast majority of players expected to have to repurchase their games, updated to be able to be played on PS4. OPs question was about digital purchases, not physical media. It was also about generations of the same vendor, not two different vendors. PSN is PSN. 

Don't get me wrong, I fully expect that all our PS4 games, digital or physical, will work on PS5; they've said as much. OPs original question, however, implies that even he expected his digital purchases to carry over from PS3 to PS4, which they did not, and that's what I'm pointing out in my reply to /u/w3ntz."

What every other movie in the franchise lacked is what Alien was at its core: a sci-fi *horror* movie. Every other film in the franchise, with *maybe* the exception of Alien 3 (which I actually liked, though most **hated** it), Alien was the only *horror* flick in the lot. Aliens was most definitely an action movie, as was Resurrection; I'm not even sure what the Prometheus films are supposed to be. Drama? I had such high hopes for those...

Anyway, although it's hard to put that genie back in the bottle after seeing the chest-burster for the first time, what the Alien films need to go back to is being sci-fi *horror*; not action or drama. We need to be creeped out. We need to feel claustrophobic and alone. We need to be on the verge of panic attacks because ""Jonesy. Heeeere Jonesy, Jonesy."""
