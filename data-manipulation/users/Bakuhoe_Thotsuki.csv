Professors,ffh45mv,t3_etg1rm,1579922618.0,"I did a trivia game as exam prep once and I just bought a giant pile of candy which was handed out for every correct answer. Honestly, I had intended it to just be like a funny lame thing because I figured theyd be too old for that kind of stuff but they got super into it and competitive. I was definitely generous with the ""prizes"": 1 candy for a partial answer, 5 for a solid answer, 10 pieces for an answer that would get full marks on the exam. And students could ""steal"" if they could improve on another students answer. (They didnt actually take someone's candy, they would just get the original amount plus a bonus). By the end, they all had some candy and had taken a bunch of study notes, so it felt win/win to me and I just let them grab an extra handful out of the bucket on the way out. This might not be exactly what you're looking for if you want way cooler prizes, but this was really fun for my class and probably cost me less than $50."

Professors,feo3hka,t3_eq1he1,1579294614.0,"My first class I ever taught, I had a 40-something student who was a bit of a mess with regards to anxiety, desperation (school was tied to social assistance for her), being poorly organized, and somewhat just not ""getting"" school. It was really apparent to me that she was going down a bad road after the first week or so of class. Basically what flagged it for me was that the questions she had about the class felt like they were the ""wrong"" ones - like it felt like I was being asked for an explicit step by step roadmap to an A above and beyond what was enumerated in the syllabus and on the grading rubrics. She was a total PITA in that first week. So I asked her to meet for office hours to have a coffee and talk about the course because she seemed nervous about the class and I wanted to touch base with her about it. 

Her life was rough and it was really obvious to me that this was a person who was trying very hard to make a better life for her and her kids and who was probably not the best equipped for university. So we talked about her study habits and what kind of home environment she had to work in and we talked about her workflow. I got her in touch with the writing centre and I told her that it was important to use the essay-writing resources they provided and that she should unapologetically seek them out for assistance with stuff. We made a deal that she would be in routine communication with me about her assignments so that she wasnt asking for last minute extensions and I expressed the importance of trying to stay ahead of the work because once you slip behind it turns into an avalanche. Maybe she did seem a little entitled at first, but I think if you're older and coming back for something like this, there's a lot of academic grab-ass that you really don't have time for and I totally respect that. In the end she passed the course by the skin of her teeth, but she seemed pretty proud of herself for doing so. So I dunno, maybe try having an office hour meeting with the student to just try and see where they're coming from?"

So she emails me the morning of class as I'm walking to work in a blizzard to say she's probably going to be late to class because of the snow. I think to myself that's weird, but ok.

>Probably because the people who have that information are part of the industry, because you get that information by working with sheep. Try talking to an actual shepherd sometime.

I'm not terribly concerned about how a shepherd on some small scale farm treats his 20 sheep. There's a massive global import/export industry we're talking about here with animals being warehoused and shipped in containers across the world. You can be as glib and snotty as you want about it, but you seem to be presenting this view of the wool industry as comprised of sheep frolicking in a meadow with Bo Peep, which I'm highly skeptical is the reality for most livestock."

Amazingly, what I thought would be super awkward and weird, was the least awkward way to ask for a haircut I ever experienced.

5 years ago, I decided fuck that noise, I want my hair to look like what I want. So I collected a stack of about 10 good, clear, larger pictures of the kind of look I wanted (a bunch of old school Joan Jett and Patti Smith photos, actually) and I just said ""Hi, I want something like this. Can you do it?"" It was great. I didn't have to try and describe things and have the stylist look at me confused or anything. Also, rather than just settle for a ""whatever"" cut if they couldn't help me for whatever reason, I just told myself I'd cancel the appointment and try someplace else another time (if the stylist said they couldn't do it) or research an alternative look I wanted (if the stylist felt like my hair was either too thick or fine for the cut).

gaybros,fdervyw,t1_fden71s,1578345317.0,">Nor, I assume, had reason to be?

You'd be wrong there, but not all of us had the great privilege of passing as straight for most of our lives. I grew up on a really shitty, remote, northern reserve. Homophobic violence was a pretty common daily occurrence for me. Things changed over time, but there was every reason to want to be closeted where I grew up.

>You're attempting to live in a world in which there *are* no reasons for being in the closet, and therefore no reasons to avoid outing someone.

I think I've been pretty clear that I'm not passing judgement on a person's desire to be closeted. Do what you want/need to. But it isn't anyone else's responsibility to assume you are closeted and then act accordingly. If people don't know you're closeted, then they can't protect your closet for you. If someone lets your secret slip because you were being public about it, that's really not on them, it's on you.  Not every gay person has to go back in the closet and not everyone has to pretend homosexuality is a dirty secret because a few people want/need to stay in the closet. And if you don't know the person, then why would your first assumption be that being gay is so horrible that it's a thing that needs to be secret? If you seem open enough about it that you're visibly holding hands with another person in public, there's no reason anyone should assume you're closeted at all. This isn't like someone went through your browser history, dug through your home, and revealed a bunch of secret stuff to people. Treating it like it is is really just silly, imo.

>One day, they went to a McDonalds, and one of the guys behind the counter had a large mohawk and colorfully-dyed hair and was wearing chains. And this friend of mine, when he was little, thought that was quite a crazy hairdo, so he loudly pointed at the guy and in front of the entire restaurant said ""Wow, look at that one!""

I was that guy when I was a teenager. I wouldn't be offended for a second if someone was amazed at the amazing and crazy outfit/hairstyle i was wearing. That's the whole point. If someone were a dick to me about it, that's on them.  

>Forget everything you assume about how you might understand the guy's tone of voice better than the guy who was actually there. Just ask yourself: is it really so unreasonable to think, as OP does, that ""It wasn't a mild question. It was a loaded one, and one that was framed to embarrass me in front of my former classmates""?

He also said he doesn't know the guy, the guy doesn't know him, but he knows him enough to know that he recognized him from some outdoor public event where he was holding hands with with a dude in public, in a public space where gay men holding hands is at least normal enough that a closeted dude is ok with doing it, within a larger homophobic space. It's a really strange confluence of weird factors that don't make a whole lot of sense."
gaybros,fdej4zh,t1_fdegssi,1578340130.0,"Neither does being straight, but I literally wouldn't give it a second thought to be like ""I oh i saw you and your girlfriend/wife the other day!"" to a casual acquaintance because there's literally nothing shameful or weird about having a girlfriend or wife. Im not asking anything impertinent in doing so. If that level of scrutiny is too much for a person to handle, then they should do better at hiding rather than expect people to never talk to anyone about possible romantic partners because one guy somewhere might be closeted.

I read OPs update and it's weird and I don't even know how to engage with it. Like, it's not like the guy is airing private fetishes or something, it's literally ""Oh is that guy you were holding hands with publicly in a public place your boyfriend?"" I wouldn't chase after a person who freaked out about a question like that either. I'd probably be dumbfounded and confused or find it eyerollingly precious of them to freak out about it, make a scene, and storm out of the room.

I've admittedly never been closeted, nor have I really ever felt the need to ""come out"" in any formal way,  so I don't really get the situation at all. I do think it's weird to engage in ordinary behaviour publicly and then get upset that anyone notices it. I'm not passing judgement on whether or not a person should or shouldn't be closeted, but it isn't anyone else's responsibility to walk on eggshells around gay (or in this case, ""not gay"") folks because someone ~~must be gay,~~ (EDIT) might be closeted, especially if that person seems comfortable enough to be visibly gay in public spaces."
gaybros,fde0htx,t1_fddqtoi,1578328398.0,">(1) Indiscretion!? So you’re supposed to live in the shadows and only hold hands in private? 

It's an indiscretion if a person is going to get upset that other people noticed they were holding hands with a dude in public. I certainly wouldn't give it a second thought to ask about it if i saw a male acquaintance with what appeared to be a boyfriend any more than if I saw them with a red t-shirt or a cool new phone. Beyond not outing a person one knows is closeted (which is pretty hard to know in advance, cause the person is probably not announcing to everyone that they're closeted), it isn't anyone's job to keep other peoples' closets intact. So, yeah, if a person can't handle the possibility of other people seeing and knowing that they do something, they should not do that something in public spaces where anyone could see."

Just because you're expected to share doesn't mean you have no boundaries. ""Not breaking other peoples shit"" or ""respecting the things we all like to use so that we can all use them"" are also boundaries. 

We were too poor for me to have a console growing up, but if we did and people were just throwing that shit on the floor for kicks or dumping their possessions into the toilet just cause, both of my parents would've kicked our asses. We owned almost nothing, and what we did own, my sister and I shared. The same was true for if you bought snacks and brought them into the house, you'd be expected to bring enough so that you could share with everyone. Hell, we both dressed in jeans and metal/punk band tees all the time so we even shared clothes. Other than something like an MP3 player, which you had on your person all the time, we pretty much shared everything and made sure to take care of the stuff we shared so that we could keep using it.

I don't want to spoil anything, but it strikes the same kind of chords with me as the overarching story of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine or V For Vendetta. I was reading China Mieville's ""October"" around the same time that I was playing through the story and I absolutely saw a lot of parallels. 

I also really appreciated the aesthetics of moving away from the heavy medieval european look of Heavensward. I loved the look of Heavensward, but I'm all for variety when it comes to fantasy worlds. So many fantasy stories will have characters whisper or hint about other civilizations and you never actually get to see it."
