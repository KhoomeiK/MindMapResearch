TwoXChromosomes,fg1bf9j,t1_ffrldlp,1580424167.0,"a) If women enjoy sex as much as men, and (I imagine the reasoning goes) sleep around as much as men, then there's higher likelihood that children will be born knowing who their mother is but not knowing who their father is.  This doesn't matter in a matrilineal society.  In a society where men have all the power, one way as a man to be *certain* who your children are is to lock down the sexuality of the women you sleep with, and to do everything in your power to make sure they never sleep with anyone but you.  If the goal of this operation is to take away the joy and power of sex from women, leaving them only with duty (and robbing them of desire) as a reason to have sex, then the operation seems like it can be explained in that context.  Since power and wealth and heritage flows down through the male line, for a woman to create ambiguity about the male parent of her children is to take their heritage away and to take them away from their father as heirs.  Basically, it's men creating an artificial problem (""we need to know who our sons are""), pushing responsibility for solving it onto women (""'good' women will only ever have sex with one person""), and then trying to take away their ability to want anything else (""and so we'll 'help' you by taking away your desire to be a bad woman"").  Some people who have this done to them then buy into it (""it must have been necessary; it was done by people who loved me and I think I've had a good life"") and propagate it down the generations.

b) Another reason that a male-dominated society might try to limit female sexuality is that doing so pushes responsibility for another problem exclusively onto women: if men don't have to restrain themselves at all, then women become responsible for limiting the spread of STDs.  'Good' women who preserve their virginity are 'clean', and safe for men to sleep with.

EDIT: These lines of thinking, while already broken and selfish, are now also even more absurd in an age where birth control is cheap and broadly available (as it is in Ireland)."
UpliftingNews,ffxbymq,t1_ffwgxe6,1580322017.0,"I haven't known what to do with this knowledge (other than not patronize this industry) for most of my life.  Most people don't want to hear it, or think it's absurd hyperbole/a sales pitch for my clearly extremist position (I'm a vegan).  People react like they'd react to a Scientologist talking about engrams and improving conditions.  My parents' reaction was shame that their son would have allowed himself to be taken in by such nonsense.

Veganism didn't come first: it was a hard decision (and I think an extremely conservative reaction) at the end of years of learning about how this industry operates.  It's horrifying."
news,ffubezh,t1_ffu2a5n,1580238440.0,"Ask yourself which chains of logic you reject on their face because clearly there's something else at play that neither you nor the speaker is taking into account that makes your position right.

I'd argue that it's pretty easy to get from very commonly held ethical positions to, ""eating animals is not ethically permissible"".  I think a lot of people are quietly, internally, uncomfortable about where meat comes from.  But anyone who points this out is ignored/ridiculed/shot down, because clearly it *must* be permissible, and therefore any arguments to the contrary have to be simplistic/infantile/emotional.

Similarly, people who are religious often reject chains of logic that might lead them to see their beliefs as being unfounded, on the basis that such thoughts are temptations of the devil or in some way represent a challenge to be overcome, or they represent hubris (""who am I to question the divine?""), or come from people with no credibility (""atheists are clearly bad people and it's not worth the time to listen to anything they have to say"").

In order to avoid hypocrisy when calling people out for not hearing logic, we have to look at ourselves closely and identify all the places where we've heard seemingly cogent arguments and dismissed them because they can't be true.  It's a really easy blind spot to miss, and most people have something they won't hear because the cost of accepting it is too high.

TL;DR: if you set limits on where you'll allow logic to take you (anywhere), understand that these people are doing the same thing."

But unfortunately, the pharmaceutical industry is so blowing its credibility that it's damaged the credibility of science itself in a lot of people's minds.  How do you listen to the people responsible for epipens costing hundreds of dollars when they say ""a peer-reviewed, double-blind study is credible; some asshole on the internet selling crystals is not""?

Yes, people should be more careful and analytical about what they allow themselves to believe in, but we also do ourselves no favors by making it harder and harder for people to directly see what should be the obvious good results of the scientific process, locking its output away and making it prohibitively expensive/limited by the moneyed interests that control and fund it.

If ""doctor"" comes to mean ""person who calls me an idiot for not believing that giving them $10,000 every month is my only hope at health"", then of course the world will come to distrust doctors.  People will believe in anything that offers hope, and science increasingly offers none."

news,ffcl6qi,t1_ffbt1in,1579801808.0,"Unfortunately, the test will only tell you if you have it reliably three months after infection.  Even if you are testing regularly, that's three months during which it's possible to pass an infection on.  If you are relatively active, that's a lot of potential risk to partners during a period where it's impossible to know you pose a danger.

You can, of course, take PrEP and always use a condom.  But criminalizing passing on HIV at all seems like it would effectively make having sex with more than one partner without a condom a felony, and I'm not sure society is ready for that.  That's a *lot* of people (in fact, probably mostly straight people, given the ratio of sexualities in the population) who would suddenly effectively be criminals."
news,ffbrgdx,t1_ffbqto6,1579779834.0,"I think the argument isn't that HIV isn't dangerous; the argument is that making knowingly transmitting it a felony makes it more likely that people won't get tested.

And so infection rates rise."
AskReddit,ffagwc3,t1_ff9qocs,1579735463.0,"I think he learned the wrong thing, or gleaned the wrong insight into the reasons for his customers' behavior:

Customers don't *want* to be miserable.  Sites like expedia and orbitz present them with nothing but the price of the barest ticket before anything is added, and sort from lowest to highest.  People then make rational choices with the information they have.

The way to compete on quality isn't to just make your flights nicer and then get mad that people don't see/value it; it's to recognize that people aren't being presented with that information via the tools they're using, and work with orbitz and kayak and hipmunk to push that information out to customers.  Make it possible to filter unacceptable omissions out of flights / to build in the cost of amenities the customer will need into the price the site is sorting on (ie, ""show me the cheapest price for a flight from A to B with wifi and one checked bag, and if there's an option prefer the airport that has free wifi and charging stations"").  Right now it's really easy to choose the cheapest flight, and rather difficult to find the cheapest flight *that isn't painful*.  Go build that tool instead of griping that passengers don't know what's good for them as if that's their fault.

It doesn't matter how nice your planes are if people only know in a vague general sense that Delta is probably nicer (which actually... my sense of Delta was never that it was competing on quality --- JetBlue and Alaska (and Virgin once upon a time) seemed *clearly* better).  If people aren't behaving as you expect them to, the takeaway may be that you haven't done a sufficient job of communicating with them."
AskReddit,ffag17d,t1_ff9e8k9,1579734893.0,"I don't think it makes sense to blame passengers for making rational decisions with the information they have available.  Expedia makes it possible to find the cheapest flight available, and tells you relatively little about what you're losing at that ticket price.   People are intentionally (and successfully) optimizing for the signals they're given --- information about the amenities that come with (or don't come with) various fares is not presented nearly so conveniently as price is.

If I could specify that I want to fly from here to the new york area, and that I will have one bag, and that I would like to use wifi on the plane and in the terminal, and then had itineraries with all those costs factored in presented from lowest to highest, I might end up selecting flights that cost me more but which I was happier with because I knew what I was getting.  And also might end up being routed to airports with the amenities I wanted preferentially over airports without those amenities, driving airports to compete on them again."
