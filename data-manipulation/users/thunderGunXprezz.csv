politics,ffyuqfm,t1_ffyujtr,1580355629.0,I think I know this! I heard on NPR the other day that the vice president is explicitly removed from the impeachment process because back in the day the vice president was the president's political rival so I believe the Chief Justice can break a tie but at the same time I think whatever decision can be overruled explicitly with a majority vote of the body.

I could see why Biden would have said what he did if that were the case. They both know they're not going to agree on the subject. They both know hes not going to vote for him, so the only reason he's doing what he's doing is to spread the word.

Honestly, if Biden is on the trail trying to obscure his Climate stance, then I'm all for it. But if not... it's kind of childish. I'd rather see that money and effort spent supporting a candidate with a better position on Climate Change."

Off the top, many checking accounts with attached debit cards have a minimum monthly deposit amount and or minimum balance requirements. 

Along with other fees that can be accrued, its it's highly likely that ""poor"" people will at some point encounter these minimum requirement penalties.  At some point, the account gets closed, often times with a negative balance due to overdraft and other fees.

Once this happens, it's not like it's any easier for you to get an account at another institution. Once you're persona non grata at all of your local banks, you're pretty much screwed."
