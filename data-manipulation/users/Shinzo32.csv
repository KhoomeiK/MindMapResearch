ShieldHero,ff4lek1,t3_erkxdc,1579566440.0,"SAO was the same to me, it’s a very good anime and quickly rose to my favorite. It’s well done and has a bit more of an interesting story. The MC is a bit rough around the edges but his companions make up for him and are able to get through to him so he can move past a traumatic event and save people who used to hated him. There’s really good development and the antagonists have all gotten theirs so far, rn we’re on a teeny cliffhanger tho lol"
