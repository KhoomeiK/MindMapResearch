dementia,fefcvx9,t3_ek6ko9,1579053587.0,"So I now a few people have already said it, but I recommend movies that you don’t have to keep up with the plot to find it funny/interesting. My grandma looooves nature/animal documentaries and movies. She loves seeing the different landscapes and animals and there is no real plot to follow. 

Also, comedies, my grandma will always laugh at a good joke and at physical/slapstick comedy so most comedy movies do the trick."
dementia,fefb1rq,t1_fef8q89,1579052377.0,Thanks for the link! I will defo try the note method first just because she loves touching her plants so I think she’d spot a fake right quick.
dementia,fefayil,t1_fef9se6,1579052317.0,"Yeah I think I’ll try the notes first, she’s very hands on with her plants so I think she will defo notice if I swap them out with fakes. Though if the notes don’t work I’ll give the plastic ones a try!"
dementia,fefav6n,t1_fef8twk,1579052256.0,That’s a great idea! I can’t believe I didn’t think of it!
dementia,fef6gzh,t3_eo7jg2,1579049313.0,"I feel you, my grandmother, who I am named after, and who has lived with us almost continuously since I was 2 has dementia. I too turned to poetry, though I don’t share it with anybody, I find “brainstorming” (idk if that’s the word I want to use) before finally starting to write has actually helped me process my emotions a bit more. Also, I don’t to this often because I don’t want to put myself in that type of headspace, but every once in a while I let myself have a good cry. I don’t like crying in front of my family esp, my mom because she is my grandmothers primary care giver and the last thing I want to do is give her something to stress or worry about. So while I do talk to my close friends about what I’m feeling every once in a while I just let myself cry and find that it does help calm me down/release any stress or sadness that I feel about my grandma’s dementia."
