Second, HIV anti-retroviral therapies are highly effective and quite safe/well-tolerated. They are also essentially the same as chemotherapy, which is just way of saying chemicals to therapeutically treat a disease."

TwoXChromosomes,feutjpy,t1_fettokc,1579389738.0,"Glad you found some peace in the science behind it; it really is misunderstood, at best, and intentionally made to be misleading by some types of people at worst.

It's pretty amazing to see. You can grow heart cells in a Petri dish using essentially salt water and some growth hormones and they will just sync up and beat. You can watch the pulse ripple across the layer of cells in a dish.
