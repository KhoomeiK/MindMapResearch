I don’t know how often your inbox fills up, but if you took a look at my history, you’d find that I had never been accustomed to that many votes or responses.  So I think you can understand my frustration as indicated by your last comment.

As for the “unasked for advice,” yes, it is a valuable skill; however, since you replied to a second edit, you should be aware that I did, in fact, admit I was wrong and it is a skill that I possess even though the level of snark may not be to your liking.  I do not apologize for that snark since it seems as though it was preemptively called for; you did call me a clown even *after* my callous admission, remember?  Perhaps that callousness incited your response, but to then give unwarranted advice on how to appropriately handle the issue?  Not so sure I buy it.

That being said, in the future I will endeavor to not become frustrated at the onslaught of negative comments and perhaps admit my mistakes more quickly in an effort to prevent them.

Thank you for your advice."

coolguides,ffd74jh,t1_ffd58f5,1579814718.0,Pittsburgh does not refer to the internal temperature of the steak. Pittsburgh style is when a hunk of butter is placed on the steak when on a grill or broiler. The butter melts and makes the flames kick up and lightly char the outside of the steak.
coolguides,ffd6sum,t1_ffd6c7l,1579814538.0,No I’m saying that if you put a thermometer into the center of a steak and the thermometer reads between 80F - 100F then the steak is considered cooked extra rare. It is not raw.  Raw is uncooked.
coolguides,ffd4jiu,t1_ffd12hx,1579813278.0,"Extra rare or “blue rare” is 80F to 100F, still above raw. If you want a comparison, carpaccio or tartare is raw. Just starting to cook is not raw.

Edit:  The process of cooking is what earns the designation. Extra rare is also seared on the outside, so all you cannibals who want to eat yourselves would be eating raw meat.

Edit 2:  Ok I get it.  It’s still raw in the middle. Proteins blah blah blah.  Whatever."
