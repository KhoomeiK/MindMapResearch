ArmyWives,ffemd9h,t3_et6gf2,1579854300.0,"My husband graduated basic in December and he’s now in AIT - I passed the time with doing shit around the house, writing letters and filling my time with hobbies. 

I made a list of EVERYTHING I needed to get done around the house, including repairs. I made a playlist of YouTube videos that showed me what repairs I could do easily and on my own. 

Listed all the hobbies I wanted to try, and researched which ones would be easiest. Got the materials and got started. 

Joined an online support group on FB (it’s a parent group tho). 

Wrote really long letters to my husband detailing what was going on in the news, the weather, current fan theories (and my thoughts on them) on his favorite shows (without spoiling new content), I would draw him stuff - like what my day looked like - I would make future plans for when he came back, took pictures and sent them too."

rant,ffbk4cc,t1_ffayrcv,1579769111.0,"I was going to ask this as well! 

Tell your doctor you want a second opinion and ask to see if they know doctors who will do testing on you. They will either do the testing themselves, or they’ll give you a recommendation on who you can see. 

I have endo, and PCOS. My periods can last anywhere from 3 weeks to 6 months. My cramps are so bad that my legs go numb from the pain, I puke, I writhe around in pain - and the only thing that helps are a dose of muscle relaxers and a pain pill combined. I bleed so heavy I’ll soak a S+ tampon in about 5 to 10 minutes, and I have gone through an entire box of tampons in a day in the past.


This is NOT hormones - the issues that OP spoke of def imply there is an internal issue that needs to be addressed."
