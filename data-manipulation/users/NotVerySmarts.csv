InlandEmpire,ffe2799,t3_et2ox0,1579834773.0,"I moved out here from Oklahoma. I will give you all the positives that I've seen. No winter is amazing, you can have fruit trees--I have an orange and a lemon tree.  Everything is 90 minutes away:  the beach, the desert, mountains for snowboarding, and Los Angeles, which has every major event you can imagine going on.  The people here are a little softer when it comes to work, so if you bear down and apply yourself you can get ahead pretty quickly. 

The downsides are the homeless people, the crime, and the traffic. Also, the people are pretty self centered and rude compared to the midwest. Don't expect people to let you over on the highway when you've got your blinker on. Overall, I think the positives outweigh the negatives, and it will never be boring if you put a little effort into finding things that interest you."

There is a good example of musical genius leading to a person's downfall that we can use as a comparison. Sly Stone was huge in the 70's. He had dozens of hits, and was a huge influence to the funk and soul movements. He also started believing his own hype, started to become difficult to work with, and eventually became a recluse. A few years ago they did a star studded tribute to him, and Sly only came out for the final song and then left before it was over.  He was bald, but had a four foot mohawk. I think that's the Kanye we're going to see in 20 years."

One day I saw an old tree they were getting ready to bulldoze had a bunch of shiny glints around it. I checked it out and it was a shard pile. Someone a long time ago sat under that tree and tried to flake off pieces of obsidian that they could turn into arrowheads, and when they messed up they just chucked them aside, so there were dozens of attempted arrowheads laying around. I picked them up before they got chewed up by the dozer. I gave a lot to an elderly native American man I knew, but I have a few pieces laying around. I will try to get a picture of them.
