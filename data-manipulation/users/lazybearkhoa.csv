corgi,fc33mbh,t1_fc2cs8g,1577380651.0,she looks more like she wants the treat in my hand... but thank you for your concern!
corgi,fc2u777,t1_fc2bsv4,1577374159.0,Well I uploaded it as a video... if there’s a setting for looping video I don’t know about I’m sorry!
corgi,fc1kyib,t1_fc1k9qn,1577321877.0,"I didn’t say she doesn’t stress pant i’m saying she was not under any stress. I stated all dogs are different. And just because there’s a few ninny that want to jump into justice... because they assume things (know what they say about assuming) and think they’re are 100% sure of the dog they only can see through a screen. Mhmmm riiight. 

Why not focus on your dog and cherish them instead of attempting to make a bad guy out of nowhere. And your history shows plenty of attempts of internet points of your dog. Multiple... multiple times. So pot meet kettle? I really do hope your dog gets lots of attention and pets as much as you given me. :)

My fluffy daughter lives a life of lots of love, joy, and adventure. Poor dog indeed! 


Again, happy holidays!!"
corgi,fc1jghz,t1_fc1jag3,1577320582.0,All dogs are different you should definitely know that. My dog does thing differently than your dog and other dogs. Not all dogs react the same way but sure they have commonality. It’s your right to be presumptuous and ignorant. Cheers!
corgi,fc1i0is,t1_fc1hi3i,1577319372.0,"I think I know my dog better than most people... I know how to read my own dogs body language. I’ve done plenty of research because she does training and herding. And you say she “panting a lot” but you only see what few seconds not even of her. You can keep trying to put a negative spin on it with your power of google. But i’ll say it again that she’s not stressed. As much as you want to be right about it... but she really just wants the treat in my hand. Thanks again though! 

Happy holidays and happy new year to you!"
corgi,fc1gvla,t1_fc1gpq4,1577318391.0,not allowed to hyperlink ig links... and anyways you’re the only one making accusations. Thanks though merry christmas!
corgi,fc1f2jn,t1_fc1eeet,1577316845.0,Just gandering your ig and seems like your dog  Nebi is “stress panting” in a few pics? But trust me she’s not stressed as you’re trying to make her out to be...
corgi,fc1deck,t1_fc1d5c1,1577315414.0,she always get the treat... i’m not a monster!
corgi,fc1chky,t1_fc1c8yc,1577314649.0,Yeah the only “stress” you’re referring to is me holding a treat and telling her to “stay”. Nice try though!
corgi,fc0xbpi,t1_fc0wtqu,1577302191.0,a gif(t) never ends
AMCsAList,fbx31h3,t1_fbx2v2g,1577167350.0,I tried once after printing out ticket for the movie was about to watch. But the kiosk wouldn’t let me so I don’t know if it was a one time thing. Just wanted to check!
