aww,ffh35un,t1_fffmgfs,1579921846.0,A good theory covers all datepoints.  Evolution cannot explain this.  A curious scientist would wonder why this could happen.
aww,ffh30qf,t1_ffffiie,1579921740.0,An unloving family is not dysfunctional.  Its unloving and anger filled.
aww,fffbflm,t1_fff0qyp,1579880264.0,"You are completely and utterly welcome to remain blind to the countless examples of animals and humans loving each other when evolution would dictate that the animal eat the humans, or vice versa I suppose."

It is obvious that your dog loves you and shows it; many people avoid all of those pesky subjective things like love, feelings, and caring by being exclusively objective."

keto,fdi64j5,t1_fdgvzdw,1578436400.0,"Grounding is the practice of electrically grounding one's body either by walking barefoot outdoors or by using grounding equipment indoors, like pads or mats that are grounded.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ddtR0XDVU&t=701s&fbclid=IwAR3k8IObnmRNfS4CFT4fPzlsuN5aKr-CZeYSqU72ySE2N2FaGaMEDSAzDJE&app=desktop"
keto,fdi5mvq,t1_fdgvzdw,1578436161.0,"I should have said ""Have you checked-out grounding/earthing.""  But English is still behind reality.

The short explanation is that it provides electrons to free radicals and neutralizes them."

spirituality,fcvbqa6,t3_ej3wkt,1577998760.0,"I like what you are doing.  I do a similar thing.

I imagine that I am infinite and am everyone else also.  I hold that image/thought steady and realize that whatever hurt they may have done to me I did originally.  I am the cause of my present circumstances, even when someone ""else"" harmed me.  My receiving this hurt (or love or help) is really just the hurt or love or help that I sent out coming back to me.  This makes it much easier for me to forgive others, because I did it to myself (called birdyroger) in another form in a previous life.  It was all me.  You are me, starting this very helpful line of thought.  I thank you (me) for it.

It is not solipsism because the Real Self is infinite and resides in everyone.  

Understand?"

sungazing,fcmdoh7,t1_fcko66g,1577771559.0,You will heal.  I guarantee it.  Your healing will take less time the more that you help the process.
sungazing,fcmdgor,t3_ehp5tt,1577771355.0,"Take up grounding/earthing.  It will greatly enhance your ability to heal.  Yin yoga and fasting may also help.  Take a towel, wet it with cold water, lay back, and put the cold towel over you eyes and rest for as long as possible.  If you fall asleep like that, so much the better.  At other times rest your eyes as much as possible, while you are grounded.  Ground 95% of the time and your eyes will almost certainly get better and you will be better for the experience.  Whatever you do, do not lose faith in your capacity to heal."
