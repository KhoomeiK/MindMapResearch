Andi is my largest turtle (RES) and the first one I got. I've had her 12 or 13 years. She's about the size of a dinner plate. Dawson is the largest male (RES) and my second adoption. He  isn't as large as Andi, but still pretty good size. He loves to do his little mating finger wiggle for Andi. I have had him about 12 years. Marty is my smallest RES. My kids found him in the road, far from water and brought him home about 10 years ago. Charlie is my other female RES. She is nearly the size of Dawson. I acquired her and Tonto from a coworker whose kids had lost interest in the turtles. Tonto is a yellow belly slider. He's a bit smaller than Marty. I've had him about 7 years. Donnie is the little guy of the group. He's a yellow belly slider that I picked up from a friend of a friend about a year ago. Mostly everyone gets along well. They bask well with each other.
