TL:DR
A. The ADA requires that service animals be under the control of the handler at all times. In most instances, the handler will be the individual with a disability or a third party who accompanies the individual with a disability. In the school (K-12) context and in similar settings, the school or similar entity may need to provide some assistance to enable a particular student to handle his or her service animal. The service animal must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered while in public places unless these devices interfere with the service animal's work or the person's disability prevents use of these devices. In that case, the person must use voice, signal, or other effective means to maintain control of the animal. For example, a person who uses a wheelchair may use a long, retractable leash to allow her service animal to pick up or retrieve items. She may not allow the dog to wander away from her and must maintain control of the dog, even if it is retrieving an item at a distance from her. Or, a returning veteran who has PTSD and has great difficulty entering unfamiliar spaces may have a dog that is trained to enter a space, check to see that no threats are there, and come back and signal that it is safe to enter. The dog must be off leash to do its job, but may be leashed at other times. Under control also means that a service animal should not be allowed to bark repeatedly in a lecture hall, theater, library, or other quiet place. However, if a dog barks just once, or barks because someone has provoked it, this would not mean that the dog is out of control."

Guaranteed a day or so without it will get that shit straightened. You don't just up and steal someones god damn pension.

Got my 7 year old working with his own “check book” register. Shit they need to teach in schools more ... rent wise when they get older will be the same rules my parents had. I expect help and chores etc. but as long as they’re going to school to try and better themselves rent is free. No school but working i will expect a small amount of rent just enough to not hose them but still prep them for life and hopefully let them save for their own place.(again that will go into a savings acct for them that will hopefully help them with something big they might want in the future, house/car/trip whatever)"
