If you really feel like you are autistic and relate to the others, there is no need to feel weird about it. I mean damn, even if you aren't and you can relate to the others then so be it. I don't know if there is some sort of certificate of proof people ask for (haha) but if you feel a common understanding then great."

peopleofwalmart,fg7tf8o,t1_fg78qmo,1580601018.0,Yes. It is. But people on Reddit draw the line when it comes to issues that are supposed to be off limits nowadays. It's weird. A sub dedicated to making fun of people but oh don't go THERE.

Also, small Cheval is great too. You lose a little bit of the quality and obviously ambiance helps enhance taste too and that's lacking at small Cheval."

I know this is just one instance, but I'm impressed with how people are showing more appreciation for things that used to be made fun of or ridiculed. I'm speaking to experiences I've had even outside of Reddit. Just cool to see. Shows a growing maturity and respect for others."
CHIBears,fg0fsbs,t1_fg037of,1580406888.0,Haha. A lot of NBA players could have easily gone the football route but chose basketball. I would love to see LeBron take on a handball player. I could name so many other players but LeBron is a freak athlete. Someone already said Zion...I mean he would destroy someone.

chicagofood,ffx83j4,t3_evpwy5,1580319719.0,"Look for the best deal. Simple as that. Restaurant week is a little overblown in my opinion. But when you pick a certain restaurant think about if you would really order an appetizer, entree and dessert from there if you went during a non-restaurant week. You can end up spending more money at some of these places."

changemyview,ffv74nw,t1_ffv50zq,1580257270.0,Kinda agree with that. But there has to be a point where something becomes a mental disorder right? OR everything is a mental a disorder. I don't know where that line is drawn - and in reality it keeps moving.

CHIBears,ffs59ew,t1_ffs4nyx,1580173468.0,"If our defense is still as good as it's been then for at least one year, yes he could be our savior. Just be able to move the ball. I have no idea what next year brings but I'm not too optimistic our offense will improve a ton with Mitch behind center. An improved Oline will help but not sure how much."
CHIBears,ffs4fqr,t1_ffs3yot,1580172881.0,"Nice caps. And of course you can when you are speaking to a player's talent. I said he would be a good addition in response to you saying that he isn't even good enough to pass Hill on the depth chart - which is just coach speak anyway. I wasn't trying to get into the weeds about everything else. To your point, yes of course there are other things to consider for it to be a reality. I'm just saying I would gladly take him over our current starter and I think we could win with him. We probably won't make a big move. But we're all armchair GMs on here so don't assume to think there is no chance a move is made. Based on Bears history with QBs....well maybe."
CHIBears,ffs2z0r,t1_ffs2owd,1580171853.0,Salary cap has nothing to do with your comment. You clearly insinuated that Bridgewater isn't that good.
CHIBears,ffs161y,t1_ffrnmrz,1580170620.0,Are you kidding? Our current state is terrible. Teddy would be a welcomed addition.
Cardinals,ffradqn,t3_etuhf6,1580153923.0,Chris Duncan - RIP. I had mostly forgotten about him until he passed. I doubt many people in the St. Louis area ever forgot.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffp0w93,t1_ffozy90,1580084093.0,Oh you're back again. I could care less what color your skin is. I never called you a racist. And just in case you didn't know....anyone can be racist regardless of skin color. You just sound very ill informed. You're kinda sad.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffowxfh,t1_ffovrbd,1580082776.0,When did I ever say that? I pointed out communities that   were more impacted by Kobe. Minorities and varying levels of society. Meaning all types of people. Robin Williams was amazing but didn't have the same impact on that level. And nothing you said is verifiable....it's your opinion. And that's okay little guy.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffovivh,t1_ffotcl3,1580082334.0,Hmm. Nice to know minority simply means black. My opinion is Kobe had a bigger impact on people and you'll see that in the outpouring in social media and in the media. And your poorly worded anecdotal evidence without proof show me you don't know what you're talking about. It's just your opinion. Mamba for life.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffos073,t1_ffoesad,1580080922.0,Yeah I wasn't disagreeing with you as much as I was just emphasizing his impact. I'll probably see a bunch of people downvoting me because they don't watch basketball and see him as just another bballer. It's stupid though. His impact is massive.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffor74n,t1_ffoin4b,1580080735.0,"Cause it's not. Like I said, he didn't have the impact on minorities or varying levels of society. It's pretty simple."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffodhih,t1_ffo9dtl,1580076584.0,Definitely bigger. Not really comparable. Kobe touched all levels of society on a much different scale. He made kids believe they could be something. Shit. He made adults believe they could be something more. He was incredible.
PublicFreakout,ffk8wq0,t1_ffk6ty1,1580018891.0,This changes nothing. A lot of the fear mongering comes from people that aren't located in a city on lockdown.

WhitePeopleTwitter,ffk3l6v,t1_ffk1v70,1580014752.0,People like to be scared. It's really odd.
PublicFreakout,ffk38i7,t1_ffk2s4c,1580014440.0,People always die from the flu virus. There have been multiple deaths this year in the U.S. from the flu. It just happens. This is nothing more. It's just new and in a country where it's easily spread.
PublicFreakout,ffk2ip0,t1_ffk0p4f,1580013806.0,Don't be. It sounds like something out of a movie because everyone on this thread only has knowledge of outbreaks based on movies. It will come and go. Do yourself a favor and ignore the media and look up the facts in the virus.
PublicFreakout,ffk2dyd,t1_ffk0sd8,1580013692.0,Oh yeah? With all your experience of deadly outbreaks? Not just the movies.
PublicFreakout,ffk2apj,t1_ffk0zhj,1580013614.0,Maybe. But it's not that big of a deal. Seriously. Read up on the symptoms and effects. Compare it to any other flu virus.
PublicFreakout,ffk260b,t1_ffk1m8q,1580013504.0,I just posted this exact comment. I'm rapidly becoming aware that Reddit is an outlet for misinformation. It's getting toxic.
PublicFreakout,ffk1wo9,t3_etxw66,1580013284.0,You guys are all a bunch of misinformed fear mongerers. So many people here are so sure of themselves without actual facts about the virus. I'm just saying slooooow down. Holy shit.
PublicFreakout,ffk1lw1,t1_ffjrd92,1580013029.0,It's not a sure thing she'll die. This isn't even close to a  100% fatal virus. We need to avoid being so dramatic.
