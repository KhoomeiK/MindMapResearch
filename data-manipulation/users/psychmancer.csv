They can identify as bipolar but a doctor won't say you are because that is a diagnosis like saying you have a broken leg. The issue is you and doctors are talking about different things, identity choice Vs medical diagnosis.

Bipolar is an arbitrary example here.

neuro,fezzuu1,t3_er0mrb,1579463674.0,"So generally no. I'll lay out the reasons and you can decide. Also I'm doing a PhD in neuroscience, did my BSc in psychology and have spent the last 12 years learning philosophy as an amateur but not formally.

1. You won't learn the scientific method. This one is the big issue. Neuroscience is a science and knowing how to set up experiments, control variables and understand statistics are very important. I don't know any researcher who would take a student who didn't know how to do these things.
2. You won't know about the brain/mind. This one is less of an issue and what I mean is a bit more complex. Firstly my supervisor is a physicist and his prior student a biomechanical engineer so being trained in the brain isn't necessary but it helps. A philosophy degree won't teach you about how neurons work, how the brain communicates, what it can and can't do physically which lots of people don't understand. You won't know key studies or the state of brain research. This can be a huge issue for some researchers. Philosophy can provide some insight but not what we know about the brain before and after the advent of psychology and neuroscience shows, sadly, how little philosophy really contributed.
3. Philosophy doesn't have a great rep around scientists and neuroscientists. The issue is one of predictive power, philosophy is often wrong. For example philosophy has argued over how humans make decisions and the things that drive us all consciously. The more we research the mind the more we know humans do a lot on autopilot and many decisions are subconscious, with proof. Look at Stephen Hawkings famous philosophy is dead quote to get a good grip with that issue. I like philosophy a lot but also acknowledge it is useless in places when compared to just doing the experiment instead of, well, philosophing about it.
4. You won't learn scientific writing or coding which aren't utterly necessary but will make your life much easier.

Hope this helps, I'd say it wouldn't help you basically."
