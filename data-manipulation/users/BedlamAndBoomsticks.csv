Considering you feel more comfortable doing things when you are forced to do them, how about setting dates with yourself? Or a daily schedule? Then make sure you stick to it. Many people only go to the gym because they know they have a standing appointment with themselves and they respect their time and their appointments as much as any appointment they might make with another person. Respect that time and promise you make with yourself at that point. And if you can't, look into reasons WHY you can't."

Also, try being alone but in a different setting. You can be alone at a park, restaurant, library, ect. Or even in a different room of your house/apartment. It might help you be productive if you're in a different setting while also help you become comfortable with being alone. 

On a different note, what motivates you to get out of bed when people are asking you to come out and play? Is it that you are motivated if people need you? Would volunteering help when no one else is available to hang out? There are so many people out there that could use your company. Some of us are just very much extroverts. Or maybe learn to do something at home (crafting, packing up boxes of food to donate, ect) that is something you can do alone but FOR others.

therapy,ffrqg12,t3_euqp30,1580163535.0,"You have to be willing to look at yourself objectively and willing to change behavior that does not suit you anymore. You have to be willing to give up coping mechanisms that might have become like an old sweater, full of holes and drafty, but comforting all the same. You have to show up for your appointments on time, this can add yet another thing to your to-do list. You have to be willing to talk about the HARD stuff, to have discussions and open up about the stuff that HURTS. You have to be willing to set boundaries with yourself, others and even your therapist at times (letting them know if a road they're going down is not the right route for you or maybe just too soon for you). You have to be willing to be open and honest about your feelings/emotions. This can all be very draining and at times even exhausting. It's like taking a college course-- only the topic is YOU. I mean, you don't pass or fail it, but it does give you a lot of homework to take home and work on.   


It's not like you can sit in the therapist office for one hour a week and then go home and magically your life is fixed. Life doesn't work like that. That's like those people who go to church one hour on Sunday and then go home and beat their wives or something.   


You have to be willing to put in the time and effort to change your lifestyle. You have to hold yourself accountable. You have to do the footwork to make things happen. If you're just giving them a run down of everything that happened that week and go home and live the same way and do exactly what you were doing before, it's not going to work."

This new position is something entirely different that the company is doing as a new offering for their new intensive in-crisis project. A couple of the supervisors and the boss kept trying to tell me I'd be ""perfect"" for the position, but I was just like ""No, that is definitely not the route I want my career to take."" I told them I wouldn't be able to manage it without burning out within a month. The boss said that because I'm good at paperwork it wouldn't be that hard, but I was like I can't be on call 24/7 for two weeks straight and no breaks. That seems like it's against some kind of labor laws honestly. And they weren't offering anything extra except the overtime hours pay. LOL. NOPE. Big NOPE.

I literally walked out at one point saying, ""No, no, no, no, no"" and everyone was laughing, when I came back into the meeting (mostly just to be polite at that point) my boss asked if I was okay because it looked like I had gotten run over by a bus.

After the meeting though, I asked if I was still eligible for the promotion even though I declined the position. The boss said yes and was supposed to call me today about it, but I guess/hope she's busy. I don't know. I'll keep bugging her until I get it though. heh."
SelfCareCharts,ffg6etn,t1_ffg5lrl,1579899449.0,Yes. Healing is not a straight line. It's a bumpy road on an unpaved one-lane dirt backroad.
SelfCareCharts,ffg5is1,t1_ffg5a3z,1579898901.0,No. It's not simple. But the healing has to start somewhere.

SelfCareCharts,ffg5bsi,t1_ffdz6ok,1579898784.0,"It's okay to feel that bitterness and give it space and attention. It's okay to feel your feelings. It's okay for moving forward to happen in your own time frame. It is YOUR pain, it is YOUR recovery, it is YOUR life."
SelfCareCharts,ffg53z0,t1_ffeosmj,1579898652.0,"There is always going to be someone who has it worse, but there is always going to be someone who has it better. Moving through that spectrum is how we get better in life and how we recover. Just because you have a sprained ankle and someone else has a gun shot wound, doesn't mean you don't deserve to get help for your sprained ankle."
SelfCareCharts,ffg4syd,t1_fffy426,1579898465.0,I like cute <3
SelfCareCharts,ffg4qlc,t1_ffg2lf2,1579898425.0,I'm glad it helped. I hope you enjoy your weekend :)

So here we go again. Hopefully this time Reddit will post it for really reals. heh.

&#x200B;

GROUNDING

Feel your feet on the ground. Feel gravity. Feel the pressure of your body on what is supporting it. Feel the texture of objects with your fingers. Name details of what you touch, see, hear, smell and taste.

&#x200B;

TRACKING/FELT SENSE

Place your attention on sensations is the body and monitor them for a period of time. Describe them and notice when they change. Stay with yourself even if something very uncomfortable comes up; be like Velcro. Challenge yourself not to dissociate.

&#x200B;

RESOURCING

Create an imaginary Safe Place, or recall a safe, calming, comforting experience you had in your life. Imagine you're there and notice what you feel. KNow that you can always go to this place in your imagination if you need to calm yourself down.

&#x200B;

CONTACT/SELF-HOLDING EXERCISES

Put your hands on the parts of your body that feel difficult sensations (tension, discomfort). Notice how the hands feel when on the body. Notice how the body feels under the hands. Notice how the space in the body located between the hands feels.

&#x200B;

SLOWING/TITRATION

Deliberately slow down your emotions and disturbing body sensations, like slowing down the tempo of the music. Separate out and work on only a small bit of the emotions or sensations and leave the rest for later, like taking only one bite of the pie.

&#x200B;

PENDULATION

Be deeply present with an area of your body feeling activation, such as terror, anger, panic, tension. Then move your attention to a place of neutrality or calm in your body. Very slowly go back and forth. Build your capacity to stay with the negative. Also build your capacity to feel positive things again and to stay with the positive.

&#x200B;

COMMUNITY

Socialize and participate in your community. Human connection builds resilience."

But I wouldn't expect her to automatically agree with what you have to present to her. Even if you have proof, she is probably going to be hurt and confused and still a bit in love with him in the end."
