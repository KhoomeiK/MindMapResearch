OCD,ffj6d1n,t1_ffgtr1x,1579991529.0,"I hope so... I feel so bad for being like this... I feel even worse because my ""ocd"" (I was diagnosed by 2 psicologists but I can't be sure) is targeting girls because I also suffer from a sexual orientation OCD (which means I don't want to be 100% lesbian) - nothing wrong with being lesbian but I don't feel like it's me... My sexuality was always ???? To me... I hate being attracted to people if I'm even attracted to them... At this point I question everything. I know I'm attracted to my beautiful girlfriend (she is the world to me) but because I love her (that's why I consider myself demisexual-asexual)

I'm also afraid that because I was never really sexually attracted to anyone (just a little bit to people I had hardcore crushes on), I fear that I might be attracted to kids instead?? I'm so afraid to be a ""p"". Which is so stupid because for the longest time, I didn't really like kids (I liked some... The most sweet ones. The nicer ones) I always felt uncomfortable around them... But after a episode with a friend's sister, I began to feel worried I was attracted to her! I felt hopeless... That's when I started worrying I was a p...

I'm sorry... I'm babbling...

I have an appointment on Monday, I will tell her I feel extremely suicidal and hopeless..."
OCD,ffj5mui,t1_ffgfwoc,1579991004.0,Thank you... I don't wish to be bothersome... I don't feel well and I don't know what to do..
OCD,ffha83d,t3_etm62m,1579927671.0,That's so me!! But you need a therapist to diagnose you properly. You most likely have social anxiety which is part of the the anxiety disorders (like ocd)
depression,ffha3mh,t3_etm9eg,1579927557.0,Lawyer! Speak to one! Get your child out of an abuser hands as soon as possible.
depression,ffha062,t3_etm286,1579927469.0,"Hello, I'm so sorry you're in that situation... My best friend is in a similar situation as you and I want you to feel a little bit better.

I don't know what you are looking for in a woman but you shouldn't cut yourself short. Your level of attractiveness isn't meaningless. In fact, the more ""unattractive"" you are, the better the chances of you get a girl that likes you for you. I used to have a small crush on a guy who, according to my father, was ""ugly"" (and he was losing hair). Remember that you are more stunning than you realize.

Your loss of hair isn't a handicap. Be yourself. These things take time and stop focusing on your appearance so much. You deserve to be happy and finding someone is hard... Do not stress about it and being ""desperate"" for someone (I apologize for the used term), risks your chances because the best way to start a romantic relationship is to start with a solid friendship. You should change your pace.

Good luck! And remember, go slow, focus on your self and happiness (not appearances), regain your confidence and meet lots of people!"

OCD,ff7qww6,t1_ff7p6xw,1579656180.0,"I don't agree you should do that as exposure. Maybe you should face movies or anything, but information about the subject you feat will only result in more intrusive thoughts.

But like I said, it's just an opinion or an advice. Is it perfect? No, it isn't."

I have been going to therapy and I have been hiding my feelings from my parents. I do feel better throughout the day but I get bombarded by ugly thoughts, remembrances of the past and regrets that I can't seem to run away from.

I'm sorry. I'm bothersome. I know."

If you read my previous posts, youll see. I'm tormented with doubt and I can't stop wondering if I did certain things in the past... I'm so gross and shameful.
I have been feeling better but I am again falling over, tripping over every memory and wondering what truly happened and If I did something wrong.
I'm so concerned that I have already hurt someone/something In a sexual way where I get physically in pain. Out of the blue, I start crying and asking for help to God or anyone who can hear me.

I'm sorry... I don't deserve your kindness."

I truly understand how you feel... I have insecurities too (not the same as yours. I don't have trust issues or jealousy), I have ocd and sometimes I fear my girlfriend will stop liking me if I did this or that... I'm rambling. Seek therapy. Believe me! It's treatable.

I looked so horrible and manly (I'm female btw)... She tells me I'm beautiful but I can't see it... I'm so ugly and gross...
