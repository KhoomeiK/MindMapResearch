AskReddit,fddy12u,t1_fddf1xs,1578326734.0,Exactly. My SIL went as far as to personally attack all of our flaws. She tagged my MIL in a post about aging skin that a Rodan fields product helps with. She tagged me on a rodan fields product for eyelash length. She tagged someone else for hair regrowth. What a shit thing to do lol
AskReddit,fddxv5u,t1_fdd8pzv,1578326620.0,"Yeah idk man. If the product is THAT great, then it will sell itself online/in store. Instead MLMs prey on women to recruit more women for more sales like you. Even if the product is great, I'm so turned off by the MLM business model."
AskReddit,fdd1nok,t3_eklnv0,1578291239.0,"My SIL has sold party light, younique, rodan and fields, pampered chef, marky kay, lularoe, and a jewelry company that I cant remember at the moment. 

She constantly sends invites to parties and makes it known how much she has to sell in order to get free/discounted shit for herself. Shes constantly asking for more orders at the party so she can hit her goal. I spent like 10 bucks at one of her parties once and she was upset, so I then i spent about 135. She was mildly happy about it. She would say ""thanks for supporting me"" then wouldnt talk to me again until she needed more orders.

Needless to say I dont go to the parties or buy shit anymore. Everytime she signs up for a new MLM I feel like I'm the victim. I also feel like she can just ask me for the money, that would be more respectable. You want $50 for that candle? Cool, I'll give it to you if you promise not to throw a fucking party or sign up as a seller."

I also agree that he probably hasn't cheated and there isnt an indication that he will cheat. BUT when you give an ultimatum involving keeping a friend/former crush over a relationship, then you've made your intentions pretty clear in terms of what relationship you value more. The principle here is ""dont be insecure or I'll leave you"" which is pretty immature...you can just work through it."
relationships,fd74460,t3_ek7ywd,1578199180.0,I feel like anytime you're given an ultimatum involving someone else (especially someone who they dont have a special bond with - they just had a crush) then you've already lost.

1. It's kind of an unspoken rule that the lead singer does that...not the base player (even tho he sings). All other band mates saw this happening and did nothing, it's not JUST op at fault.
2. This is why venue security is helpful
3. OP probably would have told his gf NOT to stand there if he had known it would happen. 
4. Most bands know when they're about to play a roudy song and give a proper heads up to gtfo if you dont wanna mosh. I hope OPs band does this from now on."
