audiophile,feid49h,t1_feiccmz,1579135709.0,"Thanks. My understanding is that I select the optical output as my TV's output, and choose the TV as the computer's. 


This will likely be played as stereo output as the computer will only be able to detect that the TV is stereo though this is the best solution it seems! 

Thanks for the help! Might post a picture once everything's set up and wire managed! I have EVERYTHING being delivered on Saturday, from TV to speakers to the Velcro straps and rear stands haha.... Oh, just no couch for another few weeks."
audiophile,feiby6z,t1_feibnad,1579134925.0,"Nope. I originally hadn't considered connecting the tv to the PC at all and was going to sell the Logitech. I have a 5.1 set with an optical cable being delivered on Saturday (... I thought I had it all decided until this idea hit me after hitting order)

If I connect a set of speakers to the TV via optical cable (i ordered some entry Sony system ~ £200) and connect the TV via HDMI would I pick those up? My worry is it would only detect the TV inbuilt speakers

audiophile,fei86ia,t3_eou0e4,1579132439.0,"Hello!  
Two questions for you all today as I'm a total noob in this world.

1) I've bought a pair of M Audio BX5 speakers that I intend to use on my computer, mostly for music playback / videos / some gaming where I'm not using my headset. Will there be much quality loss using adapters to do this rather than an audio interface? (I believe I need 2x 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapters and a Y adapter.)

2) Is there a way to connect two sets of speakers - one being the pair above, the other being a set of logitech 5.1 PC speakers - to a computer with the option to switch between them? Reason being I plan to connect my TV to the computer and switch to the logitechs which will be set up around the TV.
