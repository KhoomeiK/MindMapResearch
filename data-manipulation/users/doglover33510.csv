PostConcussion,feubplb,t1_fetvcrk,1579385022.0,"Hey thanks for your comments! I have PCS myself, so I don't have any motives for the group other than creating a space for others with PCS to support each other in their recovery. Our current community is making big strides in their recovery, so it's been helpful and rewarding for all of us. 

The group has been up for 3 months, so at this point, we've been able to figure out who does well in the group and who doesn't. This isn't your normal chat based support group, it requires quite a bit of work and engagement. It's also a lot of work on my end to moderate and incorporate new members, which can be very tough  for me given I still have a lot of symptoms

When I launched the group, I didn't have an application process, which meant we ended up losing some members who weren't in a place to participate. We decided to create this application, so we could figure out who will do well in the group. I know it's a lot of information. It isn't something I'm storing, beyond this application process or sharing with anyone. Let me know if you have any other questions!"

Also climate change and all the reasons everyone else is mentioning). If that’s not selfless, I don’t know what is. 

What upsets me is - WHY do I have to give a reason at all? When I tell people I don’t want kids they say two things:

1. You will change your mind when you find the right guy (my response - if he wants kids, not the right guy)

2. Why?
