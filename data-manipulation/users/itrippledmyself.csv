My worry with Maine is that it's a cheap state to run, and you get a lot of bang for your buck voter-wise.  Susan is a good investment for the Republicans.  +8 in Maine is 40,000 voters.

If Dems can find something to point to and say ""Susan Collins did this to you.""  they have it made.  What that would be?  I have no idea.

I saw an ad recently that was like ""Susan Collins isn't helping Maine anymore"" and I thought okay, progress... and then it closed by saying ""Come on, Susan, get it together."" Or something like that.

Not ""time for her to go"" just ""hey how about we re-elect you and hope you do better""

Now, maybe that's a shitty ad.  Or maybe it's brilliant advertising from people who know she's unpopular and are trying to capitalize on Mainers' opposition to change. Like ""Yeah, she's fucking up, but you wouldn't want to *REPLACE* her would you?""

politics,fem0yt1,t1_felye7b,1579236239.0,"Mills (not Miller) was a known quantity and Moody was not.  She was the attorney general (elected by the legislature) already.  And her family is an old Maine political family.

Moody was kind of running as the ""next best thing"" to LePage. Who was not terribly popular to begin with...

So I don't think that's really the right way to analyze her situation.  Mainers don't like change.  Unless they see an imminent reason why she is hurting them, I think a new senator is a tough sell.  Ranked choice voting might help her opponent.

I think Maine 1st is safely Dem, but Maine 2nd has a lot of very conservative voters who have sent Susan Collins to Congress every election since 1997.  They just flipped their rep to a dem, but it wasn't a landslide by any means.  And Mainers don't like to fix shit that ain't broke.

(And btw the guy whose seat they flipped was a boring rich dude who couldn't hold a room, made a bunch of money out of state and then moved home to a mansion and decided to try politics.  The rep who took his place is a local success story, veteran, charismatic young guy who has democratic new england values but loves guns.).  

All that to say, the case that she is bad for the *country* is not adequate.  She has to be bad for *MAINERS*.

Specifically rural Northern Mainers, who are poor, working class, old, and white.  Nobody is selling a narrative like that, and if that demographic sounds familiar... it's because it's the MAGA hat trick. (Or whatever the 4x version of a hat trick is)

I'll also add that Mitch has promised that Susan will be ""well funded"" so good luck competing with that.  Although Maine is a cheap state to run, historically, I bet this election sets a record for Republican spend."

ATT,fd4objc,t3_ejzi7o,1578169421.0,"Devices on contract have a higher monthly line charge than devices on a payment plan.

Also you won’t get your “free” device because on a contract because they do that by charging you a monthly payment for the device and then crediting the payment back (another poster explained that too I believe).

Technically there’s no throttling, but they *can* kick you off if they think you’re using an “abusive” or “excessive” amount of data. I’m on the fence about that; I like to know where I stand. So I don’t know if I’d prefer to have no de-pri with an arbitrary ability to kick me off, or a de-pri threshold and no ability to kick me off. Your call there.

Check your reps math as well, if you have a mix of voice and data lines. There is a “multi-line” discount that applies to each group. It’s tiered based on how many active lines you have. More lines=higher discount. However they don’t count data lines toward calculating the discount.

In other words if you have two voice lines and 8 tablets, you get the discount that would be applicable to a two line plan.

I don’t have those exact numbers handy, it’s all in the ToS, just remember that “lines” means “phones” for multi-line discounts.

I don’t think elite is the best value, I think Performance is a better plan unless you need the hotspot."

Many fishermen with hydraulic starters carry these as backup because... one never knows.

ATT,fd44lwp,t1_fd3xnlw,1578164397.0,"There are certain situations where a microcell provides a more reliable connection than Wi-Fi calling. I have never tried it as a replacement for regular data, but consider some combination of the following:

You might, for example, have a situation with minimal to no cell service, and beyond the range of Wi-Fi. Perhaps you have plaster, or god forbid, wood paneled walls. Signal penetration is much better with the microcell than 2.4ghz/5ghz.

In the case of phones, I find the handoff much better (only applicable when leaving range of the microcell). That alone could be reason for some. Not applicable to tablets, obviously...

Or you might simply have a situation where your reception is not low enough to trigger Wi-Fi calling at all. (Phones)

Or, probably most common, if your particular tower is often congested/otherwise unusable (in my case, a shitty deployment with a half ass engineered wireless backhaul and no maintenence). Combined with scenario 1."
