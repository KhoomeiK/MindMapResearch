StarWars,ffjy10e,t1_ffjihr5,1580010080.0,I haven't seen the prequels in like 10 years. What was he right about regarding the jedi?
Showerthoughts,ffj1esb,t1_ffj1089,1579987962.0,"Lol I was waiting for someone to reply with this. Yes it's true you have a very small amount of time dilation in current methods of transportation, but it's negligible for practical purposes."
Showerthoughts,ffivfw2,t1_ffi0hmn,1579983670.0,"~~I thought you don't get shot through space, but rather your current self ceases to exist and a perfect copy of you with all the same memories gets created at the target destination.~~

Edit: wait nvm, I now realize op was referring to your info being shot through space, not your literally body matter."
Showerthoughts,ffiv3h6,t1_ffho2xw,1579983449.0,"Just sync your clock after you exit hyper speed. Like when you travel by plane between time zones, your computer will sync it's clock via the Internet and will also adjust it so that it's matching the timezone you're now in. Obviously you're not experiencing time dilation in a plane, but similar concept for the time adjustment after travel."

nvidia,ffhaytx,t1_ffhat2s,1579928358.0,I'm fairly new here. Is this sub not for technical questions about Nvidia products/platforms? I looked at the posts made to this sub before and after mine. It looks like they got responses very quickly. They were just pics of a PC or questions on drivers or something.
nvidia,ffhaqb0,t1_ffham2l,1579928134.0,"Wow that would mean even if you have thread divergence in a warp due to a conditional statement, both cases can run simultaneously in the hardware since we have twice as many Cuda cores as we have threads in a warp."
StarWars,ffh9o40,t1_ffgt5ko,1579927164.0,And it definitely wasn't the low ground
interestingasfuck,ffh9e5f,t1_ffgycmd,1579926919.0,Big brain time
Showerthoughts,ffh950t,t1_ffh6cjs,1579926695.0,"I guess if we're rolling with the fact that they can travel faster than the speed of light, then it isn't too hard to believe they've come up with some method of time keeping that doesn't break down due to time dilation."
simracing,fffgqog,t1_fff52wx,1579883602.0,I bought the 3 Porsche packs when they were on sale. I still haven't used more then one of the cars. I feel like I should go and try them all now.
programming,ffcqbdd,t1_ffcds4a,1579804990.0,"The article says their code only cheated for 10% of the images for which they knew the real answer. If they had just put the scraped images into the training data set and not made any special cases in their code, wouldn't their model always (or at least pretty frequently) predict the correct result for a scraped image it had seen before? That would alert the judges pretty quick that they were cheating rather than the 10% approach they used which is harder to detect."

Showerthoughts,ff4pr6z,t1_ff4fee0,1579569490.0,I heard it changed from basically a British accent into closer to a Malay accent.
