SmashBrosUltimate,ffposx4,t3_euh7dz,1580100630.0,"I have a feeling FP2 will include either:

2 extra echo fighters to bring the total (w/ echos and PT counting as 3) to 90 even.

A Galarian Pokemon trainer with 3 pokemon, bringing the count to 90 even."
SmashBrosUltimate,ffm9qyb,t3_eu7hzr,1580050990.0,"I think Geno is more meme than substance at this point. I think that character pick was just based on Sakurai saying it would be a cool character once or something.

People want to comment about Byleth or Corrin not having any personality, which is totally valid, but then they turn around and want a character that I literally didn't remember after playing and beating the game.

Geno might have some interesting playstyle options, but you know he could end up as a campy annoying character to play against. (He might not, too, but it's a possibility) Byleth, while similarly lacking in character, looks like (s)he will have an interesting mid-range playstyle, given that Side-b changes the game up a bit (covering attacks, grab, full hop, shorthop with one option, even if it loses super hard to shield, and likely whiff-punish)"
sysadmin,ffm5upq,t3_eu3hmr,1580049036.0,"To be fair, we only do in-place on non-HA instances, so I don't have any info on if clustering/AGs would complicate things. The single biggest complication I've seen with in-place upgrade is Sql Server Reporting Services. New versions removed SSRS from the install completely, so if you try to in-place upgrade the instance and you have SSRS, it will literally uninstall SSRS and you have to get the SSRS media and re-install/configure. 

You'll want to look into specifics on how to do it normally, and if your application specifically uses a reporting function built on top of SSRS, you want to reach out to the software vendor or your dev team to see if there are any custom reporting services configurations needed.

I've also seen issues with needing to upgrade service packs to most recent version before doing in-place upgrades, but I believe that problem is only when starting with SQL 2008 (non-r2)"
SmashBrosUltimate,ffkgmfr,t3_etzf1k,1580022434.0,"Steve would be a really interesting character. I don't care about the ""lol minecraft bad"" crowd that will rage. Creating obstacles is a new gameplay mechanic and would be wonderfully unique."
dauntless,ffitaho,t3_e8ulq1,1579982176.0,"Edit: my mistake on this one. I must have not realized berserker cells were technique slots. I guess I just assumed they would be power since they were first in the store list, and they increase damage. Sorry!"
AskReddit,ffhvyza,t3_etin5q,1579956399.0,That people making constant spelling errors were dumber. I've met multiple brilliant people at work that can't put emails together. Dyslexic people aren't stupid.
amiugly,ffhuqwh,t3_eth7cp,1579954840.0,You're pretty. I'd swipe right.
smashbros,ffhuhmk,t1_ffgffff,1579954498.0,"Yeah, I think we all kind of knew that this was part of it. It was always made into such a big deal when ZeRo took an L. Even early Ultimate, he lost to 2 top Peach players (Samsora and MuteAce) and people were like ""ZeRo has a Peach problem!?!""

 Like, dude. It's a new game. He may not be at the same level that he was in smash 4 immediately, everyone started over."

smashbros,ffae2nz,t1_ff9ztyu,1579733423.0,"The Steelers offered him a long term contract that was better than what he ended up getting after holding out, though. So not really that good of a move, honestly.

No hard feelings with the guy though."
todayilearned,ff7nk7z,t1_ff62jhk,1579653826.0,"I did a research paper on Naegleria Fowleri, the parasite from that episode. It truly is terrifying and almost nobody actually lived more than a few days after having it."

SmashBrosUltimate,ff44qjf,t1_ff3u04s,1579555502.0,I would too but I like fire emblem.
smashbros,ff3xm2d,t1_ff3l58b,1579551076.0,Yeah. It's easy to see what peak play looks like when the best player in the world is playing the character
nfl,ff30sp5,t1_ff2bm84,1579530625.0,Pittsburgh Pirates to a lesser extent.
nfl,ff2zhgw,t3_er5gld,1579529531.0,Can someone talk about the Packers defense allowing like 300 rushing yards? Not every single loss is the sole responsibility of the quarterback.
smashbros,ff011vm,t3_equ3fx,1579464028.0,"Some may be unrealistic:

Tidus or Auron from FFX
-I just think FFX is one of the best JRPGs of all time

Rex & Pyra (they would have to fight together as one character for sure) would be a very interesting character design.

Ratchet & Clank
-surprised that these don't have more of a push to be added. They could have potentially the most versatile and interesting movesets with how many items are in the game.

Minecraft Steve
-I know, I know, ""minecraft bad"" but this character would absolutely have to create walls of blocks which would be an interesting and unique mechanic.

Spyro the Dragon
-Probably not as interesting of a possible moveset, but would fit into smash nicely

ARMs representative
-I know SpringMan is an assist, but a rep from this game would be nice. It may be hard to do a moveset though. I'd like Twintelle the best."
smashbros,feztdvh,t1_feywjdb,1579461410.0,"Ratchet and Clank would need the ability to change weapons. I'd like to see the weapon select wheel from the games, and have it work similarly to Shulk monados."
smashbros,fer65wo,t1_fer0c08,1579350361.0,IMO all fire emblem characters should have a chance to say their crit lines on a counter.
smashbros,fer5zfl,t1_fepq4ll,1579350282.0,"For me, Corrin's ""good"" makes me just assume it's a faceless and no personality character. I played Three Houses so I already know Byleth is sort of short on personality, but he is a professor and is mostly shown to be unemotional so they have something to go on I guess."
SmashBrosUltimate,felwq2c,t3_epsg2s,1579232850.0,Bro I would love tetris block in smash. It would be the most ridiculous addition since G&W
LearnUselessTalents,fdxcckz,t1_fdwrmk8,1578767380.0,"Yeah, I been around boxing my whole life and everyone has their own way, it seems. Even at the same gym being taught the same way, fuckers do completely random things."
LearnUselessTalents,fdx6svn,t1_fdx2ayl,1578765904.0,"Ooh, just to prevent it from slipping too far down? That makes some sense. I didn't really have a problem without the looping around the fingers, but I think if you went too loosely around the knuckles, you could have some slipping.

Either wrap accomplishes the core function, which is wrist stability."
LearnUselessTalents,fdwjqoc,t1_fdwi9p3,1578759470.0,"Other response here is sorta missing the point of what ""solid"" means. Hand wraps are primarily to add structure to your wrist. A tightly wrapped hand doesn't have as much give in the wrist, and prevents it from bending or taking as much of the unnatural strain that punching gives it.

In combat sports where you don't really wear any gloves, it also can prevent cuts to your hands.

The wrapping around the fingers here seems superfluous to me. Not sure what purpose that serves, other than making it look cooler. I was always taught to wrap somewhat more loosely around all of the knuckles, and tightly around the wrist. This looks like it would hurt your hands after a lot of training, but there could be a purpose for it somewhere that I don't understand."

technology,fbrea5y,t1_fbr0lxb,1577042007.0,"Because their salaries are public and determined by a board, based on comparisons with the other public salaries. The board typically doesn't want to give the CEO a ""below average"" salary, because it makes it look like they are less valued than other CEOs."
