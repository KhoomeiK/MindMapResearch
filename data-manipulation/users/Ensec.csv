RWBY,ffy5ztx,t1_ffy4tj1,1580339211.0,"I'm well aware ozpin has to unite the world. That's why I'm saying it's ridiculous team rwby is trying to stop ironwood. In a realistic scenario where the overwhelming power of Salem is coming at atlas. The most logical choice is to retreat as much as you can to fight another day. The disgusting darkness of abandoning mantle so you can fight another day with the world is what makes it such a great potential scene. Atlas should seem to abandon mantle thus the juxtaposition of ironwood who swore to be a protector of the people but also seemingly abandoning them would make it all the better. Ironwood is for the people, all the people. not just mantle. They would realistically have no chance to win a fight with an all-out assault against Salem, nevermind all the havoc Tyrian and watts has caused to already lower the defenses. 

of course, though none of this is going to happen because of the power of friendship and magic of team rwby will somehow convince ironwood to fight to defend mantle and they will somehow win and blah blah blah. Even though Ruby's talk no Jutsu is worse than fucking naruto's. IT wouldn't even be bad if she talked no Jutsued everything except all of her 'speeches' are really badly written and aren't convincing the most important character, the viewer. (at least that's my opinion)

The fact is, A show in which the 'right/good' side always wins is not nearly as enjoyable as a show in which characters have flaws and the wrong choice is made. It's bad storytelling for team RWBY to essentially never have failed or to never caused bad things to happen.

Egypt once again was an independent country for thousands of years

Africa was only colonized in the mid-1800s to 1940s

China, it was never colonized though I do concede that European powers took claims to certain areas, though they never officially deposed any government.

your argument that they were colonized is stupid, not that they weren't colonized but that it makes little difference, it happened. what the fuck do you want the Europeans alive now to do? be sorry for something they never did over something that happened a 100+ years ago? no that is bullshit and you know it. France could celebrate independence day from Rome if they really wanted.

Imperialism is a thing that happened and though not popular today you would be stupid to be a ruler and not take advantage of the ability to expand your holdings, especially when your rivals are doing the exact same thing.

Slavery, surprise surprise is something that has happened globally for thousands of years. Africa did it, the Aztecs did it. the middle east did it. Asia did it. Genocide is also something that has happened globally. you are saying essentially that the Cambodian genocide never happened, the Armenian genocide, the Rwandan genocide, etc. because white people didn't commit them.

I hate to break it to you, but history is fucked up and it's not isolated to Europe. You say that ""all history books are written by white people"" is also utter dog shit and ridiculous. Yes, they were MAINTAINED by white people and priests during the middle ages (mostly for european ancient history though) but before that, they were maintained by Muslims and even the library of Alexandria. Tell me oh enlightened one, do you honestly think that 'white people' were recording the pyramids being built? or maybe the expansion of the Majapahit empire? even if that was the case that seems to be a societal good that a group of people would be so selfless to be recorders of history, I can't for a moment understand the hate you have towards people like that. Or perhaps you mean modern-day historians are all white but that makes one wonder why schools of history in japan or India would employ only white people. **maybe just maybe the reason you believe all historians are white is that you grew up in the west and learned of western history where it makes logical sense for the demographic to be predominantly white. you know since Europe is literally where white people come from?**
