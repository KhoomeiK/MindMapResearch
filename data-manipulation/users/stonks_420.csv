In my opinion, death defying flask is the best for 20,000 cubits at the store. Emblems are things that give the chharacter a boost in something, all emblems are different.

Trove,fcxh5b6,t3_ejfivp,1578062803.0,"Dragons are very valuable mounts. They give permanent stats to all ur classes, and they look good as well. So there are a couple of types of dragons: *soul dragons*- so these are dragons that require you to consume souls. 5 souls you get an ally of that dragon, 10 for a fledgling, 50 for an adult and the final form is around 70-100, depending on your dragon. They do take a bit of grinding though. Each dragon has this recipe for one soul: 1 golden soul, 4 dragon coins and a material unique to the dragon, like bleached bones for Khadavros. Now onto fragment dragons-These are dragons that don’t need souls, but need more recourses. So it’s 300 dragon coins, 2 unique materials and a fragment of the dragon. Most dragons need 100 fragments, but some need less. You can get fragments from a lot of places, unique for each dragon, like the divinity dragon from shadow market or starfire drag from ST bosses. Either way, you gotta grind. A lot. *Egg dragons or hatched dragons*- these are dragons that are similar to the fragment dragons, but instead of the fragments, you need a dormant egg of the dragon. You can get the eggs by either crafting it, buying them off the marketplace or it being dropped rarely from boxes, like the everdark drag egg from shadow caches. Onto primordial dragon- these dragons are very useful. There are 3 primordial dragons, each element(fire, water, air) and they cost 400 dragon coins, 100k flux, 2k gem dust of their element and a diamond dragon egg. You get them very rarely out of empowered gem boxes or craft them for 400 diamond dragonite. The primordial dragon you get gives 10% power rank to that type of gem, and they each have a special ability, like the fire dragon shoots really fast, air one flies faster, and water one makes water wherever it shoots. The stats are really good as well. Now onto dragon effigies. They can be bought in packs off the store or they can be given as an apology for long maintenance breaks. They give any fragment dragon or hatched dragon, but not the primordial or soul dragons. Dragon coins can be bought 750 cubits for 5 dragon coins, or you can get them off doing hourly challenges in the hub. I really hope this was useful, and if there’s any question you want to ask, you can ask"
