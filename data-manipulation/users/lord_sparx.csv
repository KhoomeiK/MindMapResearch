Desertion rates, insubordination and lack of will to fight by troops near the end would suggest otherwise. They had drained the will to fight out of the US forces and if you dont call that a military defeat then I don't know what you would."

MensLib,fexvqjz,t1_fexllnb,1579437239.0,"I'd call that pretty rare. 95% of men in the UK aren't circumcised, that is an overwhelming majority of people. I personally only know of 3 people who have had it done and that was for medical reasons. I don't know a single person who's had it done for religious reasons."
MensLib,fewzwya,t1_feukdr5,1579422071.0,"I'm from the UK so I can't speak for everyone. Circumcision here is incredibly rare, only really performed if it's a medical necessity. It isn't really a hot button issue either because there doesn't seem to be the stigma attached to being uncut like I imagine there is in the states.

I've never heard a woman refer to an uncut penis as weird and there isn't the whole ""look like his dad"" thing either which I really don't rate as a good excuse to modify a childs body without consent.

I'm not against it at all if that's what you want though, I just don't really agree with people making cosmetic decisions for their kids without them having any input."
