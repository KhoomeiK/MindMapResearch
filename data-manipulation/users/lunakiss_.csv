depression,fes8910,t3_cml6ni,1579362447.0,"I need to take a shower, and I've needed to for a week. I can't find the motivation to do it. I'm working on it and I've tried. But when I go to therapy on Monday I'm really anxious about telling her that itx hasnt gotten any better. What's wrong with me? Why cant I do this. I keep saying later and later never comes. I wish I was a whole person. But I guess I should be grateful that I've gotten better with my oral hygiene. But I still feel like shit about everything else."

Theres tiers (eg v1 vs v15) for how many total you've recharged 
Sometimes you get vip xp without recharging dias though"
