IAmA,ff3gmrz,t1_ff2jg89,1579540630.0,I am well aware that gfr is not a %. My 30% is based on using the ranges from the comprehensive renal panel for all metrics not just gfr. Renal function is a lot more than purely your gfr. It's a rough estimate but it's easier to say 30% than list of every metric in your labs everytime someone asks.
IAmA,ff3fzoq,t1_ff2qjup,1579540271.0,"I understand that's not how it is scientifically measured and yes a creatinine of under one is very common in transplant patients however in layman's terms renal function is referred to in % to help people understand the impact. Explaining to someone the complexities of everything your kidney does from proteins to phosphorus and potassium not to mention the impact of sodium is a long arduous process that most people shorten by referring to it in %s.  It's why when people ask how I'm doing with my kidneys I dont say ""well I have a creatinine of 2.7, phosphorus of 4.9 and potassium of 2.1 with 2+ blood in my urine"" I just say I'm at about 30% function because that's the ballpark. 

While lots of patients get to a normal creatinine in a few days, others have an average creatinine of 2 to 3 particularly older patients. Age has a significant impact on a patients outcome after a transplant."
IAmA,ff24goe,t1_ff1ymxj,1579493546.0,"Hey man not to be an ass but I think you mean the transplant is at 100%, she will never be at 100% renal function again. The best you can get with one kidney is about 50% renal function. Which is awesome and totally able to live normally. I'm at 30% renal function and live pretty normally. What's her creatinine at about 2 to 3?"
