rant,ffhob4m,t3_etnpwb,1579945132.0,This person is never going to understand how you feel if you don’t tell them directly.. either explain the truth to them and give them a chance to change themselves or just leave them for good. You’ll find much better people out there with more equal relationships

TooAfraidToAsk,feppeun,t1_feorhri,1579326918.0,Exactly my thoughts! The whole point of doing it in a bathtub is cause op is too lazy to do it in the sink but this way is so much more work. Makes me wonder if he really is sanitising it or just saying that for reddit lmao

TheCircleTV,fej7vx7,t1_feitunq,1579160644.0,Personally I think he would have been fine without her. Doesn’t matter cause Ed would have been kicked out anyway cause they needed “the ogs” for the finale :/

Where people are complete strangers and you’ve never seen these ppl irl? It feels in genuine to me, leading to me suggesting he compliment more ppl irl if you want to compliment so bad..assuming he/she doesn’t do that often cause most ppl don’t actually"

Instagramreality,fdqn4b6,t1_fdqm83e,1578670585.0,Thank you! It just baffles me how people give/accept compliments like this. A compliment should be sincere to have any actual meaning. People will downvote anything they can’t accept to be the truth :/

unpopularopinion,fdnwj5z,t3_em7wi9,1578594285.0,"100% agree. If it’s not being used with bad intentions I don’t see why it should be such a big deal. I was wondering if the n word is so offensive then why do they have no issues when it’s being used by someone of their own race? Doesn’t make sense to me. I don’t mean this to be offensive to anyone, just saying if you’re that offended by it don’t let anyone use it right?"

dating_advice,fdgwy2l,t3_el7gwa,1578410364.0,I would say it depends on the reason they broke up? If they ended on good terms then after a 7 year relationship it shouldn’t be that weird to have a dinner together with fam..I guess he could have told you about it before tho. This kinda thing is very situation specific and it’s really up to you. If you think you really like this guy and can trust him then do that otherwise probs best to leave if you’re  having trouble trusting him and suspect something. Remember going with your instinct is hardly ever wrong

unpopularopinion,fcdzxhs,t1_fc7k0hl,1577615447.0,You’re right it doesn’t mean that YOU should commit suicide. Doesn’t apply to everyone tho. You can’t tell someone else how they’re suppose to feel about their issues
unpopularopinion,fcdz8a2,t1_fc7ldmq,1577615306.0,"You know what it feels like to lose someone to suicide plus you have suicidal thoughts yourself? Then it shouldn’t be that hard to understand why they did it. Suicide isn’t selfish. If anyone I’d  say you’re the selfish one for wanting those people to stay alive for your gain, when they’re clearly suffering. You are speaking for yourself when you say your family is the reason you’re still here. What about people who don’t have families/ loved ones or people who would care for their lives? Not everyone experiences difficulties the same way. Not everyone is built the same way to just keep going cause “other people have it worse”. If you really have depression as you claim to,you’d understand that depression itself is pretty selfish because it kinda forces you to be that way,wallowing in your own misery all day and people in that state don’t really give a shit about someone having less money than you do. It’s about trying to make yourself better and when you can’t, you just give up. Life’s not easy and I’m glad you’re able to fight your shit but you gotta understand that not everyone can"
