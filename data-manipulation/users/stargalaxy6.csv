Where in the world is this?"
JUSTNOFAMILY,ff4yjyg,t3_ernshi,1579575544.0,"In the first place you did NOTHING wrong! Second, if one of the children get injured by him EVERYONE is complicit in knowing about the abuse and doing nothing. That makes them legally at fault as well.  

This is the hardest part of adulting in a JustNo family. You get told your whole life “Don’t Tell”, “This is a family matter “ or “you ruined their lives!”

Why?? Because you saw something WRONG and spoke out about it? Because, now “people “ are watching her family and making them deal with and be responsible for their lousy parenting? 

Oh Well!!

You did EXACTLY the right thing!!
Good for you!"
JUSTNOMIL,ff4pwmz,t1_ff3rjji,1579569594.0,"Ooops! 
You forgot that she basically told the SIL that she had a horrible childhood because she wasn’t worthy of love!

Seriously!?!? This woman needs to NEVER be around any child!"
Parenting,few2zm8,t3_eqqutl,1579404731.0,"Go back! You acted appropriately! Honestly, why did that mother let her child near your kid when she was obviously in “timeout “?

She had NO business correcting your child. I would tell/ask the leader to also write out a paragraph about “correcting”other’s children. Not everyone parents in the same way and I have literally been loud/yelled yelled out at people “That’s okay the Mom is here!, I got this!” 

So you have a group of toddlers, sometimes they have bad days and you just calmly leave and go home. 
 
My favorite way to calm my cranky kids was to let them take a bath while having a popsicle. Magic time! lol

Don’t let Momzillas get you down! You’re doing great!!"
