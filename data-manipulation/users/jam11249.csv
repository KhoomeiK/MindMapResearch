europe,fg034cj,t1_ffzia8p,1580399161.0,"Um, yes the Scottish vote could have changed the result. 17.4m voted leave, 16.1m voted remain. This means only 0.65m would have had to have changed their vote for it to change (a vote gained for one is a vote lost for the other, remember). Scotland had 1m leave voters, more than enough to swing the vote.

A quick back of the envelope calculation shows that this amounts to Scotland voting 87% remain. That's not even counting those in Scotland who didn't even turn up to vote, which was about 1.3 million and equally could have shifted the vote the other way.

If we are going to treat Scotland like a homogeneous mass with a unified opinion on the EU, quite frankly they should be stuck with it too because as a population they could have could have put another 2.3m votes into the remain pot while taking 1m out of the leave pot, which would have put the referendum at 51.3% remain."

My word of advice with duolingo is that while it is good for learning vocabulary, especially at the start, I find it very lacking for understanding how grammar works. You only really learn by example, which is enough for simple sentence structures, but things like knowing which of the past tenses to use, or when to use indicative/subjunctive (for example) are really difficult to understand in that way. If you're at the start, a good book will go a long way (my classes use the Aula series, which is more aimed towards adults. Given that books are always dull, it doesn't do too bad a job)."

I can hopefully at least lend a hand on my tips to help learn Spanish. I'm not sure what you're level is of course, but I can recommend a few things. 

There is a great podcast called [Notes in Spanish](https://www.notesinspanish.com/) (also available on spotify). It's a couple, a British husband and Spanish wife, who do podcasts generally about life in Spain, aimed at non-native speakers aiming to improve their Spanish. The beginner podcasts are more like Spanish lessons, but the intermediate/advanced (there honestly isn't much difference between them) are just the two discussing cultural aspects of the country, so as well as improving your listening, you can also learn more about Spain as a country. They tend to explain more obscure vocabulary, and if you sign up for the paid version there are transcripts and exercises too (though I found the podcasts alone very helpful). 

One very good way to broaden your vocabulary is to read. If you have a kindle, you can install dictionaries, so that when you highlight a word it produces a translation, for when you come across unknown vocabulary. Reading non-fiction in particular I find to be a great way to broaden vocabulary, and learn how to communicate more confidently about more complex themes, which would certainly be of use as you'd be going into a technical profession. 

The BBC Mundo news app is a pretty good resource. It's qualitatively very different to the English language BBC news app, in that the majority of their stories are long-form, self-contained articles on more general themes, rather than short bursts on breaking news. They also have a youtube channel, which currently includes an interesting series ¿Hablas español? in which they discuss themes around the Spanish language, its origins and some interesting subtleties. 

Really, the best way to practice though is to get out there and practice with people. If you can find things like language exchanges, where you can talk with native speakers, this would be a great opportunity, though it really depends on how many Spanish people there are looking to improve their English in your area. There may be local meet ups in your area if you google them, otherwise there are a plethora of websites for arranging tandem meetups. 

The common thread between all of these suggestions is that they are actually interesting ways to learn, rather than studying verb tables. Obviously some amount of study is needed, especially at the start, but I think that study burn-out can easily slip in without you even realising it. Learning a language has a great advantage over learning mathematics or chemistry, in that you can learn and practice it by socialising or through entertainment media. It's a much more pleasant way to learn, and even committing yourself to just listening to one podcast per day, or reading one news article per day, will slowly but surely help you progress. 

Hopefully this will be of some help to you!"

europe,ffzj31h,t1_ffzblu7,1580381672.0,"I had a Russian friend married to a Spaniard, with the Spaniard living in the UK. The Russian wanted to move to the UK, but entering as a spouse of an EU citizen, he would only have been permitted to reside, not to work or study, automatically. It may be the situation is more lax as you're a US and not Russian, but the moral of the story is that even if you were married and we had stayed in the EU, you'd very likely need to apply for your own Visa for work or study. 

Also, the Russian applied for Spanish citizenship, as it would be the easiest way to enter the UK (compared to obtaining an indefinite visa). The process took years, he had to speak good Spanish, and came at a nontrivial cost. I don't know how the process works for spouses of Germans, but I cant imagine it being much easier. Also I recall (but may be wrong) that Germany doesnt permit dual citizenship, so you would have to forsake your US citizenship to obtain it."

We are a huge continent filled with many great minds, sitting in an ever changing world with challenges and opportunities that we couldn't have imagined even 50 years ago. Forming a ""federation"" of countries is an old idea, but surely we have the vision and capability to do something better, something more modern. I'm certainly not the person to decide how to restructure a continent, but I'm confident that there exists a will and a way to build something that allows a large scale unification and identity while respecting and promoting local identities, equipped to tackle the global-scale issues of our times, without resorting to a system of governance that predates the industrial revolution."

In the English constituency I lived and voted in for the referendum, the remain vote was higher than Scotland. The greater London area, significantly higher in population than Scotland, was very close to Scotland in terms of remain vote, plus every single central London constituency voted remain as well. And let's not forget that the 1.6m leave voters in Scotland would have been enough to change the vote to remain by a comfortable margin, had they voted the other way. There is of course historical reasoning to treat Scotland separately, but let's not pretend that the English are a homogeneous mass of leavers. There's a great number of us (just over 13 million in fact, about 8 times as large as the Scottish remain vote) being dragged out of the union and having rights taken away against our wishes too."

Futurology,ffzdip2,t1_ffz95xz,1580373614.0,"You're completely right in that you just have to look at the densely populated wealthy cities to understand the US has a systemic problem with public transport. I live in Spain, which has a GDP/capita about half that of the US, and public transport in major cities works like a dream with modernised infrastructure, and is damn affordable too (80c a journey for the metro where I live). Even smaller towns are typically well serviced by bus lines here, the thought of owning a car has only ever crossed my mind in as far as it makes it significantly easier to get to a particular beach that I like. In the year and a half I've lived here I've used a taxi twice, once because my friends were drunk and didnt want to walk 20 minutes, once because I was with my parents who are a bit stuffy about public transport late at night. Compare this to almost every time I'm in the US where I redownload uber before landing, knowing full well that, despite being in a major city, I'll likely need it every day. 

When I lived in Ohio, public transport was almost non-existent. I was in a town about the size of my hometown in the UK, both about the same distance to the nearest city. In the UK we had a train station and buses, in Ohio there was I think *maybe* a bus a day out of the city, though I dont think it even ran daily. 

Yes the US is big, and this puts *some* limits on the effectiveness of a country-wide transport system, but the country seems to have given up on wanting something better, even for day to day local transport."

Taking the view of gender (not sex) as a social construct, ""womanhood"" would have nothing to do with your genitals at birth so can apply equally to trans and cis women, whilst the qualifiers ""trans"" and ""cis"" give added information about the specifics of their biology. 

You could think of it as an analogy to parents. Biological and adoptive parents are both parents. If you were to use only the categories ""parents"" and ""adoptive parents"", it has a clear implication that adoptive parents aren't ""real parents"". Whilst if you used ""biological/adoptive parents"" when the specifics were necessary, and ""parents"" when they aren't, this provides a more inclusive vocabulary for non-traditional families, that doesn't make them feel ""less-than"". 

Again, I'll emphasise, I have no desire getting into any debate about chromosomes, whether trans women are real women or whatever, because I'm sure you won't change your mind. I've just laid out what the concerns are in hope you can empathise."

JoeRogan,ff5fr28,t1_ff51sjw,1579590917.0,"There's definitely a kind of circularity I see in the ""Tyranny"" argument from pro-2A folks. It seems like they argue that guns are needed to protect them from tyranny, and the way they talk about it you'd think ""tyranny"" is defined as not having access to guns (to protect them from tyranny). 

I think the US is definitely in the boiling frog analogy as far as tyranny is concerned. As you say, the US is hardly the utopia of freedom it often claims to be, despite the few clauses in the constitution that might lead a superficial insinuation of ""profound"" freedoms. Yet rather than actually campaign for a profound political change, it seems like these guys just want to wait for everything to reach breaking point while making sure they reach the ""shoot up the White House"" stage with their guns by their side."

Go to look up the structures of ant hives and you'll see that infertile members are pretty commonplace. The reason being they they, like us, survive and thrive because of their complex social structures rather than individualism. The sterile drones get their genes passed on to future generations indirectly through the genes it shares with the fertile members of the colony, and this has worked out to be a pretty good evolutionary strategy. This is an extreme version of what's called *inclusive fitness*, and had lead to a kind of ""gay uncle"" hypothesis to explain the benefits of same sex attraction from a darwinian perspective.

If you actually want to learn more, there is a very well referenced book called *Born gay, the psycho biology of sex orientation* that I recommend you read. While there's other theories out there to explain it too, theres some neat evidence that can be linked to this idea (like the well studied fraternal birth order affect can linked to this argument). All the details are in the book."

It got to a point the manager would give me a personalised list of todo's during set up, along side the generic one everybody else had between them. It all kind of reached a boiling point when this manager pushed me too far, and the realisation we were all making exactly the same minimum wage (and tips were always split, and barely existed because it was the UK).
