rareinsults,ffe0rsx,t1_ffdizx9,1579833734.0,">  although I personally think label it as sexist is a bit of an extreme.

I think this is a problem with how we tend to characterize discrimination. In the US, at least, we (or at least white people) are taught to think in terms of overt discrimination when we're taught about things like racism and sexism. By contrast this is very subtle and more of a systemic form of discrimination - things came out racist because of the time or system in which they were developed.

This is also the reason why [HP computers can't always see black people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM) and [film didn't always render black skin tones well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d16LNHIEJzs). The discrimination isn't name calling and explicitly exclusionary but it is there and is a side effect of an issue.

And this is why diversity in the workplace is such a big topic. If there were more minority engineers at HP, they may have caught the camera not tracking a black person. If Kodak weren't targeting only white people, then film would have been better balanced sooner."
