Can you even recognize a pit bull if you saw it? Because it’s not even a specific breed.

Take a look at [this organization](https://atts.org) that has been conducting temperament testing on specific breeds. If you notice pit bull is not even a real breed, there’s plenty of breeds that fall under the “pit” category, sometimes incorrectly.

Educate yourself on breeds and temperament."

Bernie has a 40 year record of fighting for blue-collar hard working Americans in OH, MI,  PA, and FL. What the hell has Trump done for them? These Americans aren’t that stupid and they know trump has turned out to be all talk. It’s a long campaign and Bernies message is growing by the day. Do you even know what that message is? Do you care about working Americans or billionaires?"
politics,fe4lwbd,t1_fe4klmz,1578860667.0,"I’m fully aware that the electoral college will be around as long as it serves republicans. 

Trump will lose the popular vote again, but it doesn’t matter about the percentage overall, it matters about the states.... and those key swing states where trump edged out Hillary?Bernie is way more popular then Hillary in those parts and will take those states.

Saying you can lose the popular vote by a certain percentage and still win the EC and not focusing on individual states means you don’t understand how this works.

But it sounds like you really want trump to win so good luck but unfortunately there’s no such thing as a new fresh trump voter. Guess who’s got the populist momentum this election year?

I’d be really surprised if as a TD user you actually listened to what Bernie has to say, in long form, maybe on the joe rogan podcast? I’d bet you agree more with Bernie than trump if you actually took inventory of your own thoughts, and not what Fox News tells you to think."
politics,fe4jpkh,t1_fe4hjgw,1578860043.0,"I didn’t say that before, because it would’ve been wrong. I knew it would be close because, as a Bernie voter, HRC was less likely to win. However, she did win the popular vote and only through some lucky electoral victories in swing states did he squeeze it out. By the way the electoral college needs to be dissolved.

That being said, the millions of Americans that voted for trump because of their disdain for “the swamp” now see that he’s full of shit and that Bernie is the one who actually can shift Washington politics so that it actually represents the people.

So trump is going to lose the popular vote, AGAIN, but this time by a larger margin."

I admittedly am very disappointed by centrists who I believe are partly responsible for our current state of being. (Centrist in US= right wing for the rest of the planet)

You say you agree with me but I really don’t agree with you. You’re a right winger in centrists clothing. And by the way  you need a better accountant, or I just don’t believe your profit and tax margins. 

I do get upset when I’m told people vote for trump because of dumb shit like unemployment. Again, who cares about unemployment when no one makes a living wage? Trumps base are hateful, racist, xenophobes. Not every that voted for him in 2016 but if one still supports him after this obvious con I want nothing to do with them."

THERE IS NO MIDDLE, that is an illusion for the right to get their way. How can you negotiate to the middle when you start there? If you were a centrist you should still vote far left just as a negotiation tactic.

Reddit is not as left wing as you think... the right wing subs are all over the place.

Glad to see your profits are up... on behalf of democracy. He is NOT smarter than i can admit he conned a bunch of racist morons. Remember he lost the popular to Hillary?

I see you’re spouting a right wing talking point about an editorial sanders wrote in 2011. Did you bother actually reading it? Or are you just taking the Fox News point out of context?

""These days, the American dream is more apt to be realized in South America, in places such as Ecuador, Venezuela and Argentina, where incomes are actually more equal today than they are in the land of Horatio Alger. Who's the banana republic now?""

What he’s talking about is simply closing the wealth inequality gap in America. Because it’s not immigrants, democrats, or republicans ruining the country, it’s BILLIONAIRES. I’m guessing you’re not one, so why do you support their interests?
