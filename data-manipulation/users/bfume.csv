There would be no perceptible difference to one's self nor to any outside observer that anything had changed if you were copied and the original were destroyed.

I'm saying that the concept of an original ""me"" doesn’t matter.  Nor does the concept of an original ""you"" or ""anyone"".  All that matters is what *is*.
