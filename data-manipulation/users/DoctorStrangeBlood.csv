The resident got punched in the back of the head and thankfully was only temporarily blinded. The attending got punched in the jaw and nearly had to get reconstructive surgery.

It had an effect on me. After that I swore off the field, even though the lifestyle is great and apparently outpatient can be pretty cool."
medicalschool,ffakng6,t1_ffahqkq,1579738119.0,"I admit that it is rare. Something happened at my hospital where there were switching the company that the doctors worked for. Something went wrong in the transition and doctors had to cover a ridiculous amount of patients. The hospital doesn't have a pt cap which normally isn't an issue, but in this case the guy was seeing nearly 30 patients. I was cool with it though since it let him forget about me and let me study."

That's weird, I never thought this before med school students started talking about it as a concern. As far as I've always seen it, you work with patients and you can prescribe controlled meds, you're a doctor. If we're being so rigid then we'd have to exclude radiologists, pathologists, and probably even anesthesiologists. It's not worth worrying about what other people think."

For example you might love surgery, but a few years into it and you’d probably be more willing to pay the hospital the money they would’ve given you to do a surgery rather than have to go for a 2 am chole."

 In my medical school we talked about “naturopathy” for about 20 minutes. It’s a good conversation to have because there’s so much healing in placebo effects and cultural beliefs surrounding community “healers”. In that sense I do agree with her that we really can learn something from people about the concept of helping patients feel better by knowing what surrounds everything about their condition. 

That said though, her ending with “stay in your lane” corrupts the message by making it seem like ND’s have some superior form of medicine or really what would qualify as medicine at all. 

One scary thing to note, some states like Arizona are so desperate for primary care doctors that they’ve expanded the scope of practice for naturopaths to allow them to have prescribing power and treat patients as if they were physicians. This is incredibly dangerous and their training is effectively them certifying themselves as “doctors” with no involvement from the American Association of Medical Colleges. They create classes that look like regular medical school courses like biochemistry, then fill them with a bunch of pseudoscience about the benefits of garlic and onions."

Other news sources didn’t do the same this time but they’ve done their own similar things. Everyone’s going to jump on a lead when they get the chance.

When it comes down to it make your own decision about news source you prefer and back up what you hear from neutral places like politifact."
