143g water  
3.3g yeast

This is half of what I call my everyday bread.

I mixed the flour and water (at 50 celsius) and let it sit for 1/2 hour in a bowl. Added the salt and yeast and mixed it together by hand. Gave it another 1/2 hour. Then I just pulled it up and slapped it down a dozen or so times. Repeated that 1/2 hour and then 1 hour later, for a total of three slapdowns. Shaped it into a longish loaf, let it rise on a baking sheet for 45 minutes, then baked at 250 celsius for about 20-25 minutes (I think, I went by looks).

This is not how it normally looks and feels and it's just crazy how much difference this made to just kneading for 10 minutes then rising and shaping."
