There really aren't many flats around here and the boat traffic is so bad with all the credit card captains and jet skis running around it can get to be a pain in the ass.

Edit: also, if you're willing to fish a jetty  I would suggest jupiter inlet. The water can rip through there so you'll need some heavy weights if you're trying to hit the bottom but I've seen some huge boys get dragged out of there. Over slot snook and reds all the time."
