You acknowledge that this was not a representative plane passenger. You understand that you're going to have to ""yes, really"" this, so you know that most people will honestly have a very difficult time imagining *anyone* doing this. How is it at all strange that you can't imagine a fat woman doing it?

I mean, really, lady."

I believe games can be art. I believe even shooters can be art, though it's a difficult thing since shooters are generally mass produced. (And I think that Biden is wrong about violent media, which does include movies for him.) But let's face it, the majority of multi-million sale EA shooters aren't even aiming (haha) at being pieces of art."

That last episode was really cringe-worthy, but there were a bunch of parts before that that were also pretty boneheaded, and not just because the characters are boneheaded.

fatlogic,fe96pmj,t1_fe7trht,1578934873.0,"That's a little hyperbolic. No, a lot hyperbolic. Obesity can take as much as 8 years off your life, which is presumably an average between people who are just hitting obesity 1 and people who are in My 600 Pound Life. Average life expectancy is  over 80 in most developed countries for both women and men, so most obese people can expect to hit their 70s."

Plenty of people are uncontrollable, and plenty more are listening to people who actively advocate for refusing to control thier diabetes. Why would someone with a disability advocate for others to give themselves a disability they don't have to have? I'm afraid I can't understand that. Do disabled people advocate for teenagers diving into the shallow end of a pool because becoming a paraplegic isn't the worst thing that can happen to you? It seems completely absurd."

Certainly, I cite it as part of the reason I am not Catholic, as it forced me to think about things in the context of critical thought that would otherwise have been background noise and that I might not have bothered examining.

I graduated from UofT with a degree in computer science with a specialty in software engineering (edit: tbf, just looked at the actual degree, which doesn't mention majors/specialists or even program, so I guess that's on my transcripts, not my degree). Software engineering definitely wasn't a degree when I went through, though you could certainly do Computer Engineering and take some software courses.

todayilearned,fdb33mk,t1_fdaxdqq,1578253219.0,"I dunno, I think there's some overlap. I helped deal with SCADA systems in the early 2000s. They were often connected to poorly managed Access databases. If the engineers had understood what they were doing with some of those things... And someone had to write and design the basis for the SCADA systems (I mean, I'd assume it's still being written), which really should be done at least in conjunction with engineers... That said, most coding jobs aren't going to be related."

Of course, you're right that financial literacy should begin at home... but so should sex ed. I think we've found people are bad at teaching their kids both of these things. I won't say that sex ed is taught perfectly in schools, but it's better than when kids learned from stealing dirty magazines or relying on parents giving them a lecture about the birds and the bees."

Gambling can't be an addictive substance, as it's not a substance at all. But we still call it an addiction. You can still ruin your life with a gambling addiction, and you probably aren't going to fix your gambling addiction by allowing yourself to go on a guilt-free trip to the Vegas casinos."

In the clinical settings (generally, medically supervised programs) employed by other researchers rather than the phone survey plus weigh-ins from people who are still in Weight Watchers, it's a much lower value. That's based on real research.
