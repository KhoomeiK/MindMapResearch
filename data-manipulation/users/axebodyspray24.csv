Said infant was crying, upset, wouldnt sleep, etc. I went downstairs high as balls and just took the baby from my mom, and tested to see if she was hungry. I made a bottle and took her up to my room and she fell right asleep after eating. When I came back downstairs to grab a diaper in case she woke up, my mom told me that my eyes were really red when I came down and I was oddly mute (I usually talk to my niece in a baby voice when shes upset) all I could think was ""Oh shit"""
