meatcrayon,ff5pvwd,t1_ff5fq97,1579605306.0,I almost when down when a refrigerator fell off a flatbed.  A bunch of cars that saw it swerved into my lane so I swerved out directly into the path of the refrigerator. The door flew off so I needed to split the door and the main box part. I drove over some of the shit that broke off (maybe a handle or that metal toe kick) and it flipped up and scratched the paint on my bike.
meatcrayon,ff5owf2,t1_ff59qt5,1579603894.0,I owned the bike for four years and put some serious miles on it. It was my first road bike so it was a bit much for me at first but I was comfortable with it after a couple of years. But the aftermath of that accident left a big impression on me. Two people were laid out and one of them was missing a leg. Some of the people in the group they were riding with were crying while others were kneeling over the victims. I could hear the sirens of the ambulance/police approaching so I didn’t pull over (what the hell kind of help could I be of anyway)  It fucked me up a bit. I drove through the intersections where the accident occurred just five minutes before.

meatcrayon,ff4y0ge,t1_ff4sc2l,1579575169.0,When I had my ZX-7R my mom actually offered to buy those for me because she was always worried when I went out riding. Never took her up on the offer because I was out for a ride when I came across a bike accident right after it happened. It was pretty gruesome and I ended up selling the bike soon after.
crtgaming,ff4xbi6,t1_ff4ryy8,1579574684.0,I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Daewoo here. My buddy had a 19” in his room when I was a kid. I was jealous because I had to use a 19” RCA with the two dials and single speaker that my parents kept in their room.

meatcrayon,ff5pvwd,t1_ff5fq97,1579605306.0,I almost when down when a refrigerator fell off a flatbed.  A bunch of cars that saw it swerved into my lane so I swerved out directly into the path of the refrigerator. The door flew off so I needed to split the door and the main box part. I drove over some of the shit that broke off (maybe a handle or that metal toe kick) and it flipped up and scratched the paint on my bike.
meatcrayon,ff5owf2,t1_ff59qt5,1579603894.0,I owned the bike for four years and put some serious miles on it. It was my first road bike so it was a bit much for me at first but I was comfortable with it after a couple of years. But the aftermath of that accident left a big impression on me. Two people were laid out and one of them was missing a leg. Some of the people in the group they were riding with were crying while others were kneeling over the victims. I could hear the sirens of the ambulance/police approaching so I didnâ€™t pull over (what the hell kind of help could I be of anyway)  It fucked me up a bit. I drove through the intersections where the accident occurred just five minutes before.

meatcrayon,ff4y0ge,t1_ff4sc2l,1579575169.0,When I had my ZX-7R my mom actually offered to buy those for me because she was always worried when I went out riding. Never took her up on the offer because I was out for a ride when I came across a bike accident right after it happened. It was pretty gruesome and I ended up selling the bike soon after.
