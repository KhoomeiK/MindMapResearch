ptsd,fdcoy3u,t3_ek3pgk,1578280365.0,"I have this problem all the time.  Myfamily has stories, that we consider funny.  The problem is, it was horrific abuse.   So, sometimes, we tell these stories and there is a normal around, and they get very upset.

for instance, my mom had these brass ashtrays, they were shaped like angel fish.  She could throw them like ninja stars, and they were super heavy and sharp.


google image search brass angel fish ashtray, and imagine getting one in the face.

anyway, this is one of the humorous stories.

i have a friend, and she wasn't abused like that.  and sometimes when we tell these funny stories around her she cries.  it's hard to know what is appropriate and what isn't.

it's a good thing we don't talk about the stuff we find dark, i cant imagine what that would do to her."
