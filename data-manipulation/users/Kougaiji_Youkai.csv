PubTips,fcv8jtn,t1_fctu3n9,1577996876.0,"Yeah it's not typical to show quotes from your manuscript in a query letter, even though you are meant to give a sense of what the book is about. If you do decide to, I wouldn't do more than one and I would introduce it as a quote. Right now it's a little confusing because the quotes are just dropped in without any context."
PubTips,fcteija,t3_eirgcw,1577940709.0,"I'm not sure of the word count on this query, but it is way too long. It should be 4-5 paragraphs max. You should also focus more on describing the book and less on narrating your history. Your life experience matters for this book so you should mention it, but save the monologues for the actual book. If there is an over arcing theme or story to your book, that would be a good thing to describe here."
