Unexpected,fcd17ne,t1_fccjl6x,1577605093.0,"Movies aren't pretending to be real. Is this concept so hard to understand? These clips are STAGED and attempting to make the viewers think it's NOT staged. Most people in the comments here think it's real, but everyone knows a cinema movie isn't real. No one would watch these videos if they were presented as sketches. People are sharing the fuck out of them because they think it's real. Can people please start getting this?"
Unexpected,fcd08t8,t1_fcccxjx,1577604761.0,"I really feel like I'm taking crazy pills with this stuff. The companies that make these staged videos that are attempting to look real, are essentially lying to you. Although they aren't literally telling you it's real, it's heavily implied from the context. I will never understand why people keep falling for this shit, and especially not people who get that it's fake but still defend it."

These things are only funny if you think it's real, but most people don't realize it's staged, so they upvote and share the hell out of it. There is a strange amount of acceptance for this behavior, and if you don't like it, or just point out that it's fake, you're somehow a party pooper."
