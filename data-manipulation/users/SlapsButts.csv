CompetitiveTFT,fgyllxz,t1_fgxtauw,1581184550.0,"My problem is not specifically for the creep round drops, my problem is that the number of items will never balance out. I prefer gold starts, remove the 2 gold drop on creep rounds and i would take gold anytime if the items balanced out. And if you see my posts i've always advocated for hard econ on last place to winstreak to win the game, i literally created the [Skarner carry](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/comments/dzk9ft/skarner_carry_v2_counter_those_pesky_mages/) that intruduced the [fast lvl8 to winstreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/comments/du25nd/you_are_all_using_skarner_wrong_presenting_carry/) I just want that eventually the number of items balances out in the minion rounds to have everyone within the same potential late game power, so something like wolves equalizing everyone's number of items since raptors is often too late and krugs nulifies any strat or power the early gold or items gave. And that's the thing, since currently wolves don't equalize and raptors are often too late and don't even equalize since what happens is that after it 2 or 3 people still often have 2 items more than anyone else your late game potential is reduced in comparision cause very other round will give 1 full item and the difference will remain the same.

.

Also i want to remember something that is very important and seems a bit forgoten, just because you can do something, it doesn't mean it's correct. Which normally is more used to complain about lol champions having stupid mechanics, but can also be used in TFT like malphite ult radius, cho'gat and sejuani were fine in set 1, but in set2 we have mage and it completly breaks malphite, malphite is completly fine as it is, but not when you get it as mage. And now it being rng getting the spatula it feels even worse due to you not being able to do anything and someone just ""outplays by rng"", personally in spatula regards i would prefer that the 4th caroussel had 2 spats so you had an actual strategy element to it.

.

And i forgot a few bugs, but it was 2am so it was mostly from immediate memory, like sometimes when you upgrade a unit that is on a elemental hex it loses the elemental hex bonus and you have to move the unit to another hex and back to get it."

Here you go, made a thread yesterday and lots of people agreed. If you need more screenshots of bad item distribution just ask. It's so consistent that the people with most items have many more items than the others consistently troughout the most important parts of the game. The catchup system is not working and people don't catchup and mostly they die before they even get a chance to get closer to the number of items of others.

Remove 2 gold drops in first three creep rounds, no item is worth so little, including dropping two 1 cost champions. 3 gold should be the minimum. I had a game today with 2 gold drop on first creep round and another on 2nd creep round, got one item and 3 gold on double drop catchup. It's really fun at 4-3 having 3 completed items and going against people with 5 or 6 fully knowing you will in no way get even close to finishing the game with the same ammount of items unless they die at that moment and you survive many more rounds. Today at 5-1 i had 7 completed items, the 2 guys at the bottom had 4 and half. This is a legitimate complaint, we can still win, but personally i don't feel it's fair, the maximum in my honest opinion the person with the most luck should have maybe one more full item than the person with the least luck, i like gold vs item starts, but since it never balances to a point where the person who left the first rounds with the most items having around the same number of items and the person that left with the least it never feels trully good or fair, you get a trade off of early game power in gold for late game power in items but we can't make the choice and our shop might not even give us something so we can properly use the gold for early game and most of the times we are forced into lose streaking to get items and try to win by sheer outleveling and having few but the most critical items and since this meta is so agressive and high on face damage, you mostly try to play for 4th which i don't find in the least fun or fair that the game forces me into that and i want to play to win every game, not be forced into this. It should equalize everyone's item at the end of every stage, that's the most fair in any scenario possible. X guy has 5 halfs at krugs? Cool he gets more gold than the guy who has 3 items got in the first creep rounds and this guy gets items to equalize. You still get the rng of gold being worth different things at different stages and everyone gets different, but the same number of items. I want everyone to be able to play for 1st not have half the lobby just trying to make it to 4th trough rng rolls because they have no items. And before you say i don't have experience or rank to know how it really is, i have a challenger account on RU, a GM account on EUW and 2 more Diamond accs on EUW, so i know and feel it first hand in the highest ranks. I remember i hated it in the first set, but mostly ignored it in set 2, but i guess my fun ended and now in frustation i notice this more.


Also caroussel feels awfull, items repeated and missing items, today i wanted a cloak from caroussel and let my hp drop enough for 1st pick, 0 cloaks but 3 vests and 3 tears, not even belt or rod, which felt great obviously since i needed zephyr (cause i got a belt on first caroussel and creeps gave me gold, gold and gold+tear) to stand a early game chance and inted for it.

Also please remove neeko help from creep rounds, unless you give me two of them, i'm buying a 3 cost early and neeko it and sell for gold.

Nerf the rat and allow it's ult to use hurricane, atm when rat ults with hurricane, hurricane disappears and does nothing.

Nerf malphite ult radius, his radius at lvl 2 is 2.5 hexes and imo it's too much, make it the hexes next to him and at lvl 3 make it bigger. Even it being the hexes next to him it makes him an insanelly powerfull pick if you get mage hat, it's braindead simple, you get mage hat, LB goes out since she's useless and malph goes in everytime. Or give aatrox the same treatment of scaling ult radius out of proportion at lvl2.

Fix the pathing and targeting, i see too many of my carries deciding on a epic melee 1v4 when they have 660 range or when melees go afk waiting for singed to get to them or stop attacking randomly with enemies in range. I've started building RFC many times just to make sure they stay away from trying to melee.

Fix MMR and matchmaking, i have a smurf that i started playing challengers when it was [S1](https://i.imgur.com/AgtxRvp.png), on D3 i was still playing challengers, but when i got 4th i got 1 lp and when i got 5th i lost 17 lp, i'm matched with people much higher than my rank, i got to D3 with 31.3% winrate, 77.1% top 4, the game matches me with rank i'm supposed to be but gives me no lp to get me there. I got more lp in my d2 smurf with d1 mmr on euw, so i get more lp in higher rank against worse enemies, well done game.

Muito reads as Muinto, but if you writte muinto it's completly wrong, when i was in school this was my first mindfuck. Am/Ão read as exactly the same but make the word/verb have diferent meanings, but you can have words with Am on the midle and the begining and it will read as Am and not ão, except if in some temporal forms like Passaram-se EX: ""Muitos anos passaram-se..."" (many years have passed, reads am as ão) to ""Muitos anos passarão-se..."" (many years will pass, reads the exact same as the other one) Completly opposite meanings, yet the word reads the same and you will have to infer ( and this will occur in almost every verb). Ç/SS/S(when after a consonant) read exactly the same but you gotta know the word. Sometimes o reads as u. In some words C reads as S/Ç like when after the E or I vowels. Viagem and Viajem read the same and almost mean the same, but one is a verb (viajem) the other is a noun (viagem). And don't get me started on the Á/Há/à/a. the word ""como"" can have so many different meanings i can make a conversation only repeating the word ""como"", EX:

He: Como como? ( how do i eat?)

She: Como? (what?)

He: Como como? ( how do i eat?)

She: Como? (how?)

He: Como como como (I eat the way i eat (trollface))

(also works in spanish and in both languages it still has more meanings, the thing is since there's so many accents in the portuguese language and you pronounce como in different ways you start wondering if you should accent it)

It might be beautifull due to all the nuances, the giant amount of words for everything and everything else, but my god. We also have the PH->F, Sometimes V->B (or everytime depending on where you come from or how serious you are which will even complicate more when it's a person that does this and he says ""a Banda é má"" Does he mean Vanda (name) or Banda (Band, but other possible meanings) is he criticizing the band or a member? and has many other words which can have confusion), G->J except when it's GU like guerra which reads g like g and ignores the u, but not for the a/o/u vowels which don't need the u after G to make the G sound.

languagelearning,fdmms6i,t1_fdlcv6m,1578555952.0,"The other day i found this youtuber from amsterdam doing a challenge where if he didn't speak your language you would get 5 euros, i then watched him, just basically repeat the same things in different languages ""can i be your friend?"" ""can you give me a hug?"" ""Yes i can speak xyz"". Worse yet was when he tried to speak portuguese and spoke spanish. I can only claim to speak 7 languages, but at least when i speak them i will actually be able to hold a conversation. It was especially painfull on a video where he found an actual polyglot that could speak many languages and would actually say a lot in said languages and he could only repeat the same sentences in most of them."
