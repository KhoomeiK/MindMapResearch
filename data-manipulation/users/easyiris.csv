UnethicalLifeProTips,ff4u2s5,t3_erdkdg,1579572463.0,"We used to spot critics where I worked cause they always went to the bathroom after they'd found a table and looked at the menu but before they ordered, and they'd always ask for a VAT receipt. They also never ordered alcohol with their meals unless they were clearly there to write about the beer we brewed. They never took notes.
