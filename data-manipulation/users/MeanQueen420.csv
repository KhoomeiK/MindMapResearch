hsp,ffjeigj,t3_etxb8x,1579996574.0,My mother said I would constantly cry as a baby. The one only way she got me to stop crying was to run cold water through my hair.  I always enjoyed nature and the company of animals as a child. I got my first iguana in 2nd grade. I enjoyed the company of animals more than people. I could not stand the music of the ice cream trucks as a child. I had a fourth grade teacher who would make the classroom really cold and I did not enjoy that at all. It also effected my learning in a negative way. I couldn't stand my father's loud coughs/sneezing. The list is endless.

politics,ffekg39,t1_ffei0j2,1579851762.0,Doesn't make it any better.
hsp,ffdswaq,t3_eqosf4,1579828101.0,"I felt this way growing up. People would give me dirty looks, bully me, and make me feel like I was the issue. It took me a lot of soul searching and healing to realize that I was not the issue. That they were the issue. I'm one of the very few white people in my town, and I am highly sensitive so it made me even more of a target. I had a teacher who had an issue with me for no reason in 4th grade. He would humiliate me and signal me out in front of the whole class. Since he did that I was constantly treated like crap by other students. I was the quiet kid who never did anyone any harm. I know how you feel and it sucks. I would suggest making one friend that you have things in common with. Do you go to college? Because if you do I would suggest joining a club. If you work, try getting close to a co-worker. It's really difficult to make friends, so don't feel bad if it takes awhile."

cringe,ff58onu,t3_erknt7,1579583544.0,This is disgusting. YouTube should not allow this. The comments on YouTube were even more disgusting. The women he followed should've pepper sprayed that fool.
cringe,ff5891x,t1_ff4wl6p,1579583147.0,They should've pepper sprayed him tbh. I would've.

AmItheAsshole,ff26vuv,t3_er4rxt,1579495510.0,"YTA, she needs help and you throwing her out is the worst possible thing. It's like you are too lazy to deal with her so off she goes. She's 18 years old. I'm sorry to say but not everyone knows what they want to do right after high school. If she has no motivation to do anything with her life it can be an underlying mental health issue."
todayilearned,ff1otqf,t1_ff1ni6n,1579482867.0,Okay
todayilearned,ff1mrnj,t1_ff0fhgb,1579481756.0,I thought Enron died.
todayilearned,ff1mn3q,t1_feznggz,1579481697.0,It's still not easy. We get 14$ hr right out of college with a 3% wage increase every January with zero benefits. Don't forget that it's 3.1k a semester just to go to a Cal State. We have to live in a basement just to save because some morons thought it would be great to buy everything on credit they can't afford just to lose it all anyway.
