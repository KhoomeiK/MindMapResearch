Chiming in pretty late, but this is such a pull yourself by the bootstraps middle-class American mentality, the other guy is absolutely correct. If you've ever experienced the poverty the Kims are in, you would understand that their lack of money does not wipe out desires to celebrate, to survive, and to make mistakes that all humans have. Just because money is tight doesn't mean you suddenly have to give up all joy in the world, at that point why even bother living? This can also be seen in the scene between mr kim and the former housemaker's husband, where mr kim asks him how can he live without any future prospects. The Kims at the end of the day had none either, and no American-style delusion was going to change that. So at that point, you just live while you can"

>But they're not? Israel doesn't even have control over the areas where the majority of them live.

Well let's break it down

4.75 mil Palestinians reside in the ""State of Palestine"" if it can be called that. Of that, approximately 3 million live in zones B and C, which are either in part or whole administrated by the state of Israel. In addition, there's approximately 2 million Palestinians living in the internationally recognized borders of Israel, which gives us about 5 million Palestinians under direct control from Israel. 

Now, according to the 2010 census, 74 percent of the approximately 9 million population of Israel proper is Jewish, giving us an estimated 6.6 million population.

Now I don't know about you, but having a difference of 1.5 million people controlled by Israel IMO is not a big enough difference to not call them both constituent nations"
