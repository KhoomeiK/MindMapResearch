insaneparents,ffea8dw,t1_ffdheiq,1579841040.0,"Its starting to get partisan too. In Oregon, [Senate Republicans staged a walkout in May](https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-senate-democrats-give-up-gun-control-vaccine-bills-gop-walkout-return/) to kill a bill requiring vaccination. It's increasingly becoming part of their platform."
oregon,ffe9o31,t1_ffd2a04,1579840554.0,"You just had to tempt me... Man, they read like the comments on local news websites."
HollowKnight,ffcz3yy,t1_ffctfuj,1579810237.0,"Oh yeah, no point in not using the fragile charms! I feel like I overinvested in damage when I should have put more charms to not-dying"
HollowKnight,ffcyzes,t1_ffcg6gf,1579810167.0,"This was a few weeks ago. I had to put it down out of sheer anger, but I think I'll pick it up again soon.

And that's great man! Godhome isn't really important until you unlock most or all the bosses anyway. Clutching out trial of the fool feels great, but I personally felt kind of empty afterwards. Like more of a fool than a champion."
HollowKnight,ffcymfu,t1_ffctiqu,1579809963.0,I was in the same spot! I always forget how hard that section is.
HollowKnight,ffcfi34,t1_ffbtdu0,1579798345.0,"I made it all the way to the Hollow Knight on a flight before choking. I was going to knock out the speed run achievement too.

Needless to say, the passengers next to me were perplexed at my rage."
HollowKnight,ffcf5oz,t1_ffb87uz,1579798134.0,"Fun tip: If you jump and swing your nail downward on his head, you'll nail bounce giving you a bit of time and height to dash over his head!

Helped me a bunch with the fight! He gets much easier once you are tuned in to his gimmick. Even his ""enraged"" mode isn't too bad (especially with shade cloak)"
woodworking,feu5acz,t3_eqaxh8,1579383262.0,All jokes aside what a beautiful build! How did you go about dimensioning and drying it? I imagine there are a few hurdles to processing a log that fell on your car.
StardewValley,fetrble,t1_feorjjg,1579378819.0,Oh wow I never noticed that! Pam is a menace!
StardewValley,fenjvgg,t1_fenj401,1579286259.0,Ooh! This game just keeps on giving.
StardewValley,fenixw8,t1_fenioce,1579285686.0,"You know, it just occurred to me that the only person who drives in the game is a raging alcoholic. Hmm."
educationalgifs,fel3oi0,t1_fel3crr,1579213374.0,"The asterisks are just revisions. I originally called it a ""lance"" which is incorrect. Sorry for the confusion."
OutOfTheLoop,fektsul,t1_fejwnfu,1579207453.0,"If it puts it into perspective, the Cambrian explosion (i.e. the emergence of complex life) was 541 million years ago, so on an evolutionary scale, we still have a lot of time to go until it's lights out (or rather, lights on)."
educationalgifs,fekffgd,t1_fekcthg,1579198915.0,"Whoopsie. I'll edit it.

Though I like that visual."
educationalgifs,fek9zk5,t1_fek6ixe,1579195693.0,"Even better: sterilize a lancet*, lance the head of the pimple and gently squeeze the excess. Stop if you see blood.

I learned from my derm that popping with your fingers can also cause the bacteria to get into your blood stream which can encourage further infection. However, most pimples eventually “pop” on their own without intervention, so a sterile lancet* gives you the opportunity to take care of it while minimizing infection risk."
urbanplanning,fehbsix,t1_fegtwig,1579113314.0,"I think you can make an argument to motorists that supporting free transit through taxesis in their interest as it will significantly reduce congestion for relatively little money.

Everybody hates traffic, so why not use that to forge alliance with motorists and get good policy on the table?"
askscience,fecvb7j,t1_fecpwec,1578986048.0,I would hardly call requiring paper bag usage “hard core authoritarianism”...
personalfinance,fdwmvky,t1_fdsp2a6,1578760299.0,That’s good to know. Thank you!
personalfinance,fdsgqwe,t1_fdsgdri,1578702415.0,That's a good consideration. I am fortunate enough to have those cushions (though hopefully I don't have to use them). Thank you!
personalfinance,fdsfmvs,t1_fdsf4m1,1578701672.0,"Nor is it my intent to withdraw from it. I am just finding it difficult to forego earning interest on a fund that I am unlikely to use, when there isn't a financial penalty should I ever need to draw from it in an emergency.

Unless, of course, there is a compelling reason that I am not thinking about."
personalfinance,fdscupx,t1_fdscntx,1578699717.0,Definitely! I anticipate linking the IRA to my savings and doing some split between the two.
AdviceAnimals,fdru0wx,t1_fdrs804,1578689659.0,That is also the case in Oregon.
woodworking,fdkk8te,t1_fdkhgys,1578505366.0,"Seriously. To add to this, Paul Sellers has a video on [plane restoration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYyV6IUpsYk) that is seriously awesome. I got lucky with a 20 dollar plane I found at an antique store, but this technique would work for really any plane."
HollowKnight,fcz51eq,t3_ejkp02,1578093808.0,"So great to see these updates! Also, out of curiosity, how long have you been carving? I'm a woodworker who has looked longingly at the relief-carving world, but never had the gumption to dive into it."
HollowKnight,fc9u8sh,t1_fc7e17q,1577558300.0,"tbf he probably looked up a few locations on the wiki. If you're going blind, I could totally see why you might be missing some stuff."
environment,fbz1d0m,t1_fbygmx1,1577232146.0,"Unfortunately, [electronic voting of all types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkH2r-sNjQs) have problems that can't really be overcome. While paper ballots aren't perfect, attacks are really difficult to scale. 

I personally enjoy our state's mail-in ballot system. The biggest barrier is getting postage to send it in."
