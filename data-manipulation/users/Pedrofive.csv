AskReddit,fffe2ou,t1_fffclki,1579881931.0,">In a sample camp, the CIA found that 95% of the gulags population consisted of violent criminals.

So also people who just didn't agree with communism but had to work in concentration camps. That 5% maybe be thousands, but for you, if it's in the name of socialism, it doesn't matter. 

>So you haven't heard of it.

Yeah you are the one who seems not to get the meaning of things. ""Dictatorship of the proletariat"" is one of the buzz phrases of communism. 

Btw, the fact that a country has a dictatorship as a form of government doesn't make it less susceptible of invasion. It may actually be otherwise. And also let me tell you dictatorships are utter trash, in case you didn't embrace democracy and freedom enough."
AskReddit,fffbxpr,t1_fffbfq4,1579880584.0,">The vast majority of which were Nazi POWs, rapists and murderers.

And also people who just didn't agree with communism but had to work in concentration camps.

>Have you ever heard of the theory of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat?

Yeah, the fake slogan of ""put an elite (the communist party) above anything else"".

>Mainly because of US backed coups that put in power people like Pinochet

Yeah US also sucks in many ways. They've always been an imperialist country."

AskReddit,fff9eh2,t1_ffexaet,1579878956.0,"The USSR killed millions, rammed millions in gulags and did atrocities all throughout its history, that's a well-known fact.

But aside from the deaths, communism is trash, as it violates several principles of human nature and freedom. Pure USA-like capitalism is perfect? No, it is not. Free market with reasonable laws and some socialization? That's the thing. We've never achieved more security, human development, freedom and rights than in current western countries, and that's thanks to its system.

Yes, we are fucking our planet. Yes, corporations do shady shit. Yes, there are wars and crimes. But  all those things either have a solution (like having a circular economy) or they are something we will never fully eradicate (murders, thefts...)

Communism is absurd, obsolete and totalitarian. And proof of this are all those socialist countries that went like shit in almost every aspect."
