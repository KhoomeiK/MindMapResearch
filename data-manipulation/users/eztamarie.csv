beauty,ffj03j2,t3_etsupv,1579987008.0,"I suffer with insane oily skin and acne on my face and use tea tree oil facial wash, toner and moisturiser. 

It’s important to clean away the oil but doing so will take away all the moisture so your skin will produce excess oil to make up for the oil being taken, so an oil specific moisturiser is needed. 
The tea tree also helps reduce the redness of any breakouts I get. 

The results are usually gradual rather than instant but this definitely helps.


This works for me, all my advice is from The Body Shop! 

(I’m in the UK) 

Best of luck! x"
