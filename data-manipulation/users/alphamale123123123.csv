Sorry if I wasn't clear but I hope you realize that pewdiepie's anti-semitic fans are few in numbers and if he continuously brought it up/discredited them only more people would do it. The biggest reason that the media focuses so much on pewdiepie is because he's popular and his name will get them attention. Sure he's done some questionable things but that's to be expected you spend most of your life under a camera. Overall he's a good person and you'd understand that if you watched him even a little bit. It'd be smart to do some research on your own before blindly believing these companies because you find them credible."

unpopularopinion,ff5lpau,t1_ff39azq,1579599034.0,The problem with that line of thought is that pewdiepie's following is so big and the people who think like this is so small/negligible there's no point in consistently addressing it. If you have a group of people big enough there are always going to be a couple of crazies look at Reddit for example.
