wholesomememes,ffypp18,t3_evoz7d,1580352115.0,I don't have any memories like this.. my parents split up when I was 7 and were always busy and I didn't really have that many friends
teenagers,ffyi2ha,t1_ffyht6c,1580346932.0,"I really don't want to hurt her, and I still do love her. I just don't know what to do. I promised myself when we started dating that I would never cheat on her, and I'm gonna keep that promise. Neither of us are in good spots mentally right now, so I don't think this is a good time to talk to her about it, but I'll try to soon"
teenagers,ffyf8xm,t1_ffye2cd,1580345011.0,"Idk, I haven't been feeling like I want to talk to my girlfriend as much, but she does so I don't want her to be sad so I talk to her anyway. I don't feel like I want to break up bc I don't want to hurt her, but I've been thinking about it. Idk what to do, bc I feel like I'm just lost"

teenagers,ffycjas,t1_ffyca9l,1580343177.0,"Long story short, we both confessed that last year (before we were both in relationships) we both had a crush on each other and sometimes our current feelings for each other don't feel completely platonic. She told her boyfriend about it, who I'm also friends with, and I'm scared it might put a bump in their relationship"
