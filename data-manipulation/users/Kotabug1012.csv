My family and I were taking care of my grandad when he stopped being able to care for himself, and we’d grab him chocolate or ice cream on our way home from work and he got so happy every time. He was so appreciative of absolutely everything his entire life. 

He passed right before christmas & even though I miss him something terrible, I wear his big flannels & it’s comforting having a piece of him with me daily:)"
