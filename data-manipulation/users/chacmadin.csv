stupidpol,felizuk,t3_epr14t,1579223323.0,"No, because the historical era that produced Thatcher, and that Thatcher herself was instrumental in inaugurating, is already coming to a close. If a Thatcher-esque female figure was going to become the President of the United States, it would have been Hillary Clinton.

I don't know who the first female President will be, what party she will belong to, or what ideological commitments she might have, none of us really do. Laying a marker down on AOC isn't the worst bet in the present context though."

Braves,fefte59,t3_eouolh,1579064626.0,"It wasn't hard to see this coming. The Braves simply don't invest a lot in free agents, that's how it's been for well over two decades now. The most they ever paid to a free agent was $80-something million to BJ Upton and he was a disaster. They got lucky last year, Donaldson and Kuechel basically fell into their lap. This year, people actually wanted them, which meant they're gone. They simply aren't competitive for top free agents, and it's something that runs deep in their organizational philosophy, deeper than whoever the GM at the time is - I'm surprised so many people convinced themselves otherwise.

It is pretty insulting to put a team that's worse on paper than what you had in 2019 out on the field in 2020, after you came within a few outs of the NLCS and signed Albies and Acuna to bargain-basement extensions. I'm frustrated again by this cheap-ass B-tier organization, but not surprised.

Avoiding big FAs by itself is not the worst strategy, especially if you can make smart plays lower down in the market, but AA hasn't really done that this offseason. I don't know what to expect next season, but it's not looking good."

I'm not saying Hastings was killed, in fact I kind of doubt it -he was known to drive recklessly late at night like he was when he crashed - but this sentiment is naive in the extreme."
stupidpol,fdg8vv2,t1_fdfbo4k,1578385012.0,"Hey man, I just turned 33 this weekend and I'm in much the same boat as you, a ""loser"" by all conventional standards, I pass for much younger too. You aren't alone. There is some good advice in this thread, especially about guilt and shame. That's what you have to overcome, it isn't helping you, it does nothing for you. I know because I deal with guilt and shame a lot, it's not easy to just disregard something you've internalized for so long but you can at least be aware of it.

As for dating, I feel you there too. You seem to be afraid of women ""finding you out"", like you're somehow deceiving them by dating or pursuing a relationship. As long as you aren't actually lying to anyone, you aren't doing anything wrong. It's not wrong to want to be loved, you aren't unworthy of it. It's true some women may want someone with more career and financial stability, but they're adults and they can make that decision if they want to. I think you fear that kind of rejection but try not to take it personally instead - you just aren't compatible.

And younger women, don't be too quick to dismiss as ""naive"" - you dismiss them like you dismiss yourself. I know our culture is turning towards a place where every woman under 28 is seen as a child-like simpleton who needs a permanent guardian to prevent them from being taken advantage of, but that's not reality. I don't know, people can surprise you, but not if you don't go out and meet them.

Plus, they all have their own problems too, don't put them up on a pedestal to reflect your own negative judgment of yourself back to you.

As much as the material immiseration, I hate capitalism for how badly it warps our psyches and turns us all against ourselves, and each other. It's inhuman, it's against life itself."
