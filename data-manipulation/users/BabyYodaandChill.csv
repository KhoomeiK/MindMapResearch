awardtravel,ffic92t,t1_ffi98ly,1579970429.0,"Okay, so there are two basic points here and you seem to be missing both of them.

ANA and Etihad have thousands of people who fly them yearly in J. Those people may like caviar more than you and I'd guess that close to a 95/5 majority would see adding caviar as a ""Step up"". But in your mind? Doesn't matter! Because its not great value...?

Continuing to argue, ""sure, I enjoy it, but theres no value in it"" means you really just don't know what value means.

Also, we started with ""I'll eat the caviar..."" and are now at ""I see NO VALUE in caviar"". Do you get tired from these mental gymnastics or...?

Either way, from the two conversations we're having here, you seem completely disinterested in reality and just want to make awkward roundabout arguments. I'll leave you to that. Good luck!

Also my point about your guilt came from this:

""something isn't luxurious just because it's expensive and rich people love it. Johnnie Walker Blue is the best scotch I've tried, but I'd take a $20 bottle of bourbon any day of the week.""

So if I follow, you'd take a 20 dollar bottle of bourbon over johnny walker blue, even though youve said JWB is the BEST WHISKEY YOUVE EVER HAD, so this somehow means airlines giving out free BEST WHISKEY YOUVE EVER HAD is somehow not a step up and is bad in your mind. Just stop dude. Its so cringe to watch this shit."

awardtravel,ffi6jml,t1_ffi43ip,1579966415.0,"It seems like you’re trying so hard to “not buy into the hype” of something that youre literally trying to deny caviar as a “step up” when you both admit its great to eat and an expensive luxury option. But somehow its not a step up for everyone, because you wouldn’t spend your own money on caviar, even though you do enjoy it.

Also, its possible to enjoy all the things on a flight. There arent “things youre supposed to enjoy “ and “frivolous crap”. They give you all this stuff for a reason, because it provides a great experience. In my case, id rather have caviar and expensive whiskey than worry about if some guy is manifesting weird feelings of guilt about the free caviar we’re all enjoying."

\-Be a member at a private club near one of these courses and be friends with other members of your course, who are often members at other, more desirable courses as well. This is how I played Monterey Penninsula, Mayacama, LACC, Ballyneal, Nanea and Kohanaiki.

\-Be a member of another extremely prestigious private club, become friends with the head pro. After awhile, ask if he can get you on anywhere really special. Do not, EVER ask for a specific course. I was a member at a course in the SF Bay area and asked our pro and he got me on at SFGC, which is basically impossible outside of a situation like that.
