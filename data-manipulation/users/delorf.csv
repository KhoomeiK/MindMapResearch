Independent Baptist have to save enough money to support themselves during their missionary work. They do this by begging at different churches.  At my former church, we'd occasionally have guest speakers who were missionaries asking for sponsorship. We had a very young couple who wanted to be foreign missionaries at my church but I refused to give them money .
