In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip To Be Square"". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself.
