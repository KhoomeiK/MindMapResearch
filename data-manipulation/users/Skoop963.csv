relationship_advice,ffzw1yo,t1_ffyfudg,1580394385.0,"The difference between a celebrity and someone you see all the time is you know what you are getting if you pick the clerk. Celebs have access to all kinds of makeup, clothing, plastic surgery, photoshop and video effects that make them look way better than they actually do, but meet them in real life and bam! pancake ass. But fr tho, Margot Robbie can get it."
worldpolitics,ffxkx3k,t1_ffwvl29,1580327225.0,"If he wins then remember that real life is different from what the media tells you. My political irl interactions are significantly different than the ones here on Reddit, and most people aren’t leftist extremists like you’ll find in this comment section."
worldpolitics,ffxkkmw,t1_ffxg7hh,1580327025.0,The way you worded that sounds like you feel validated by having a popular opinion.
worldpolitics,ffxkghe,t1_ffxg4hd,1580326958.0,Gaslighting much? Or is it projection?
AskMen,ffwl7fy,t1_ffvcm6o,1580304486.0,The whole “savage” trend was just people being dicks and everyone found it hilarious for some reason.
SelfAwarewolves,ffwi1mn,t1_ffv6p0q,1580301716.0,No it isn’t.
SelfAwarewolves,ffv0ijl,t1_ffu5cbe,1580252902.0,"Is all bullying bad? Is it okay to support or ignore the bullying of one person but not another? Every well known person on the internet gets some kind of hate, and Trump hate is rampant on Reddit. Is that bullying? If it’s wrong to talk shit about Greta, then it’s wrong to talk shit about Trump. By all means criticize them but please remember to be consistent."
SelfAwarewolves,ffuyeuv,t1_fftx31v,1580251724.0,"That’s the reason they chose her. The whole point is to have a representative who can’t be criticized. If anyone does, the first thing they do is “omg don’t bully 16 year old mentally disabled girls that’s bad so you are bad”. It’s effectively a bait and trap for anyone who disagrees. An appropriate tactic by the left I suppose."
ATBGE,ffucsmg,t1_ffu0wsl,1580239253.0,Hard to censor opposing opinions if you don’t have enough employees.
nextfuckinglevel,fftiesl,t1_ffsfta3,1580221376.0,Haha that source is from wired. Just like Kobe was in the video.
Conservative,ffth8fs,t1_ffsjbnm,1580220472.0,Easy to think or talk about something if you are disassociated from it. People can discuss a horrific murder case in a joking manner but if you make them watch it happen they’ll likely react differently.
instant_regret,ffs3kaq,t3_eumq7w,1580172264.0,Why does he run like he already slammed his balls once before this?
instant_regret,ffs3ggv,t1_ffqz09j,1580172190.0,And very comfortable with your sexuality.
facepalm,ffqim80,t1_ffq8vr1,1580135627.0,Worst case scenario if she genuinely didn’t see the car right in front of her would probably be a broken or bruised foot.
assholedesign,ffqdi15,t3_eul0h9,1580131271.0,They act like we aren’t competent enough to handle choosing our own entertainment.
UpliftingNews,ffnsw59,t1_ffmjhvu,1580070353.0,"Also acting like getting knocked up is an accident. I’ve been alive for a few decades and have yet to accidentally have sex, let alone create a child. There is quite a bit of effort to put in before children happen."
UpliftingNews,ffnr9kp,t1_ffk88tc,1580069695.0,"Or, hear me out, *abstinence*"
UpliftingNews,ffnph31,t1_ffnigwu,1580068965.0,"“Whoops I had unprotected sex with someone and got knocked up, oopsie.”"
unpopularopinion,ffhya0x,t1_ffhxzkr,1579959075.0,They live in the Reddit bubble. Sad to see people so disconnected from reality that they can’t even comprehend someone having a different opinion. I wonder how they function in real life.
unpopularopinion,ffhy231,t1_ffhovil,1579958838.0,"That’s the beauty of this lifestyle. Less government intervention. If you go to the opposite side that’s where you need government regulation. You wouldn’t believe how many people still have a traditional lifestyle, as many of them aren’t on the internet, especially not Reddit for that matter, and even if they were you wouldn’t see them thanks to powerbottom mod censorship. Divorce is harmful for everyone in a family, good if it has a negative stigma."
unpopularopinion,ffhxrkh,t1_ffhx6xq,1579958507.0,There is proof in her post and comment history that she isn’t a troll.
unpopularopinion,ffhxqub,t1_ffhx5cy,1579958485.0,Look at OPs post history. She isn’t a troll stop drinking the kool aid.
unpopularopinion,ffhxohi,t1_ffhxcbh,1579958412.0,Look at her profile. There are pics and comments from 200+ days back that have the same sentiment. This just doesn’t fit the Reddit powermod hive mind.
unpopularopinion,ffhxgef,t1_ffh3ddt,1579958153.0,"And look, mods deleted it."
Tinder,ffhxbv4,t1_ffhm3zg,1579958006.0,Unless...?
worldpolitics,fffzgri,t1_fffsiea,1579895173.0,"If you think all or even most Republicans were offended by the Starbucks cup, you’re also a gullible fool who is easily duped by left wing propaganda."
assholedesign,fffxz76,t1_fff8pbu,1579894250.0,"That’s not on Coca Cola, it’s on the people that buy it. I’m sure they are a shitty company for many reasons but don’t pin human stupidity on them."
assholedesign,fffxem9,t1_fffkhre,1579893896.0,No sugar just cancer crystals! Live for now!
BlackPeopleTwitter,fffwrqi,t1_fffk4wp,1579893500.0,"For sure. I used to dislike hiphop but I still liked Eminem. He can string words together like none other but when it comes down to making songs that sound good, his voice is a bit too aggressive and intense for me to enjoy."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fffwgmh,t1_fffvla2,1579893306.0,Nah basing exclusivity of anything on skin color is racist af. Self inflicted segregation.
