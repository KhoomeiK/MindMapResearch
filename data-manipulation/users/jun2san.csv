wholesomememes,ffgisc3,t3_etabht,1579907196.0,That looks terribly uncomfortable for someone like me who constantly shifts around until I finally fall asleep.

nottheonion,ffcacew,t3_ess9v8,1579795132.0,I was reading the article and still wasn't sure if it was discrimination. That is until I got to this point where it says the bank manager wasn't going to-and-from the back area to check on the legitimacy of the check but instead to call the police. WHY? She didn't do her due diligence and instead escalated the situation. That to me seems like she already made up her mind that this guy was trying to commit fraud.

MadeMeSmile,ff96ak7,t1_ff942i1,1579705854.0,I’m pretty sure that point isn’t lost with anyone. My main argument here is that there’s a time and place for everything. I certainly did not sub to /r/mademesmile to have theological debates.

Competitiveoverwatch,fego3lw,t1_feg90mx,1579098463.0,I like this solution. They’d have to either give the tanks a lot more health or lower the healers’ healing abilities. But I’m all for it.
Competitiveoverwatch,fefugm8,t1_fef5skv,1579065573.0,"They would have to make all the tanks super Tanky. Like real tanks roles are meant to be. Give them more health or survivability tools. 

Also, that would honestly make playing tank fun."
Competitiveoverwatch,fefucpv,t3_eou6lz,1579065474.0,"I hope that if they go 1/3/2, they make the tanks reeeaaal tanky. Like super survivable. Because I feel like DPS will focus on the other team’s single tank and the moment they’re dead, the team will fall."

hardware,fee0slr,t3_eolsj9,1579024006.0,I think the second best thing is USB-C. My work monitor uses usb-c and I switched my home monitor to it as well. It has made plugging in my laptop so much more convenient.

pcmasterrace,fdlyhih,t1_fdlvcge,1578535520.0,"Weird. I just watched it and nowhere in the video does he specify what kind of PSU that case accepts.

The internet was not what it is now so unless you have actual articles of people saying this, then this is just conjecture.  Or are you going from memory for something that happened almost 30 years ago? From what I remember, my friends and I were excited for Sony to come out with a system because it was the first cd-rom system that wasn’t an attachment to an existing system. And everyone was annoyed that Nintendo was still sticking to cartridges, particularly because Final Fantasy VII was being showcased and magazines like GamePro and EGM were concerned cartridges wouldn’t be able to hold the amount of data the game would have."
