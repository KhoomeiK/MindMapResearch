Juve,ffanzgd,t3_esfdnb,1579740426.0,I really liked the name Juventus and the jersey. Also loved playing with Del Piero in FIFA.

The article says their match day revenue is driven by 'high-end hospitality spaces'. That sounds shady as fuck to me cause their owners can easily shell out 10's of grand for those high end tickets and make it look like they were legit.

Sorry if I sound like a conspiracy theorist, but their financial numbers do not make sense if everything is aboveboard."
Juve,fetubji,t1_fet9znx,1579380159.0,"Sounds like fudged numbers to me. Their stadium capacity is only 47,000. They didn’t go far in the CL (CL tickets are super expensive) and they play in the French league. PSG cook their books to show higher commercial revenues too, so this wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest."

soccer,fekzugg,t1_fekzi9x,1579211046.0,"Not necessarily. Man City have a better GD than Liverpool but are 14 points behind them. Same in Italy where Inter, Lazio and Atalanta have a better GD than Juve who are first. GD doesn't account for consistent performances."

soccer,fedx8kg,t1_fedskyu,1579021815.0,"Agree. The problem with Milan is that they keep trying to reach the Champions League every year despite not being prepared for it and end up spending way more money on transfers and wages than they would earn in the CL. They have to take it step by step. European qualification should be seen as a bonus not a goal. If they give it 2-3 seasons, they could easily re-establish themselves among Italy’s top 3 clubs.
