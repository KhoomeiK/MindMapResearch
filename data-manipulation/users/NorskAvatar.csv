My impression was that Sweden has massive, cheap, tasteless cheeses whilst I always prefer jarlsberg when I can. Actually the first time I have heard anyone refer to jarlsberg as tasteless. Sure, if you pay Swedish prices for cheese in Norway you get trash-tier cheese, but there is so much good cheese in every store."

You think you can make sense of this based on the first thing you learned in... what? High school chemistry? I showed you the study, the professor who did the study disagrees with you, what more do you need? What makes you think your intuitions are enough to make sense of this? This is an active field of study and not something you can just understand because you know one fact or one tidbit or one principle. Methyl-groups changes the degree to which a chemical is fat-soluble, making it better at crossing the blood-brain-barrier, causing an increased potency per mole and increased neurotoxicity. 

Why do you think your CS degree makes you capable of understanding this based on first principles?

awfuleverything,fdxf8zl,t1_fdxdrdo,1578768134.0,"The two drugs have similar profiles, similar effects on most of the measures used, and small difference in the ones they differ. The chemicals arent entirely different, methamphetamine is just the same chemical with a methyl group on it. The methyl group makes it more potent per mole, makes it easier cross the blood-brain-barrier and makes it more neurotoxic, but they aren't ""entirely"" different. 

If you are interested to know more about this the author of the study (e: not only author), Dr Carl Hart, has done several interviews on the subject, and he does not agree with your reading of the study.

2. I'm not saying they are the same, but that people report similar effects, and that they scored similarly on most of the measures they used. 
3. See above. 
4. The author of the study has stated in interviews that both can be used similarly for attention disorders. 
5. The difference is low, and the sentence you cite is the exception to the paragraph. 

If you read the rest of the people in this thread there seems to be a consensus that diamphetamine = safe and methamphetamine = death. The methyl-group om meth makes it more easily cross the blood-brain-barrier and    makes it more neurotoxic. My point is that they are pretty damn similar.

Edit: regarding my edit, what I meant is that their profiles are similar at adjusted doses precisely because they have different potencies, posted the study some other commentthreads and pulled the trigger a bit too quickily on yours"
