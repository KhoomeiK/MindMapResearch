BrainFog,fdzjh1u,t1_fdpjtdz,1578790820.0,"I’ve had chronic headaches and migraines for the 10 years, still going. Also was on an ssri in high school, quit after 2 years, it lingered. Last year started a different ssri, but I find i don’t get brain fog from it as much as I do from weather related migraines."

lexapro,fd4prkv,t3_ejtl4y,1578169873.0,Crazy. I kind of ignored it but nice to see I’m not the only one stuttering and feeling dumber! I knew about the brain fog I’m used to it from daily headaches and migraines but damn I didn’t connect the stuttering and difficulty sounding articulate.
SuicideWatch,fcves0j,t1_fctx1ah,1578000581.0,"Thanks dude, I appreciate your concern!!"
SuicideWatch,fctwyfl,t1_fctvpwm,1577963758.0,"Yeah I’ve tried a lot of stuff and I take random pills daily, but they never seem to help. Doctors don’t really care or they don’t know what to do, but I’ve got a new one and doing all kinds of tests to find out why life hurts so much so.. fingers crossed haha"
SuicideWatch,fctsbtd,t3_eivegn,1577956934.0,"God I feel you, I’m 24 and the last decade of my life has been body and emotional pain, anxiety, depression, small highs and low low lows. Last few years I have crippling joint pains and back pain and this’ll be my 10th year of almost daily headaches and many migraines. Lately it hurts to sleep and when I wake up and get out of bed I limp and hunch over like I’m 95. 

Bull fucking shit, my soul has been too old my entire life and my body is finally catching up."
SuicideWatch,fcts5ns,t3_eieayu,1577956685.0,"I just loooove every new year where my family tells me “this is your year”, “you need to start getting on this”, “get your drivers license this year”, “go back to school”, “find a new job”, etc. I hear it 10 times a day and it the anxiety of the unknown of it all never goes away 

I’m such a pussy"
