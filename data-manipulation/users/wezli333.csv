>Also, why is a social circle necessary for self respect?

I'm not saying that one's self worth = one's number of friends. Only that having at least *some* platonic relationships is good for one's mental well-being.

>Where did he mention not respecting his child?

He didn't and I'm not saying he doesn't, or at the very least doesn't think so.

I'm just not ruling out the possibility that his son's disrespect isn't entirely one-sided. It could be that OP *could* be very disrespectful to his son and possibly not even realize it. Sometimes we make off-handed remarks that are hurtful when we think they are innocuous.

All and all, I'm just asking OP to do some serious self-reflection and consider all the possible reasons his son is acting this way. Maybe it's just typical teenager crap. Maybe it really is just as simple as him working at Wal-Mart and his son being embarrassed by it. Or...maybe there's something else at play."

Again, no one is *entitled* to respect from *anyone.* We're only getting OP's side of the story. What would the son tell us if he asked him about it? Could be that dad has recently engaged in, or has a long history of behaviors that would justify his family's disrespect? ^(remember, son isn't the only one he's having issues with.) Respect is a two-way street; don't expect any if you don't give any."
Parenting,fenfc4f,t3_eq22la,1579283474.0,"Respect is earned, not expected. The question shouldnt be why your son doesn't respect you, but if you respect yourself. He probably still respects his mother because she isn't seeking validation from him.

Edit: Alright, I'm a little concerned that the prevailing opinion here seems to be that *just* doing enough to keep CPS off your back makes you a ""good"" parent.

Now I'm not insinuating anything about OP here. Best case and most likely scenario is that his son is just acting like a typical teenager and he's fallen into the all-too-common trap of being caught off guard by it and suddenly being compelled to seek the approval of his son. My advice in that case OP is this: *BE* someone to be respected, don't just *ASK* to be respected. Focus on being the best version of yourself you can be and living a life that fulfills *YOU.* Simply seeking approval reeks of desperation, and will only drive people further away.

That being said, worst case scenario is there's a lot more going on behind the scenes that OP would prefer left unsaid that would explain why there would be strife between him and his son.

In my own personal experience, people I've grown up with, and kids I've met in my line of work, there is one undeniable truth I have learned: **some children exist in a living nightmare even if it seems like a normal life to others.** Plenty of parents will provide the basic necessities of food/clothing/shelter/etc. and even the appearance of caring and affection **all while committing unspeakable acts against their own offspring.**

Again, let me emphasize that I am *not* accusing OP of this, but those of you that seem to think that providing food and shelter is all it takes to be considered a respectable human being need to think again.

Lets just drop this antiquated and ^(forgive me for even using this term) *patriarchal* notion that being a fertile adult male puts you at the head of the social hierarchy and *entitles* you to any modicum of respect.
