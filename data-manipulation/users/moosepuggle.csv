MacroPorn,fg2gzs9,t1_fg1jy67,1580444828.0,"Crustacean biologist here! Yep, they're closer to crabs than to molluscs like clams. Here's a link to a picture of the most up to date evolutionary tree for arthropods. Barnacles are in the group Thecostraca, so they're a more ancient Crustacean group than crabs, which are in Malocostraca.

todayilearned,ffrj150,t1_ffrb5dz,1580158999.0,"But that's why I want to volunteer my time for free, because it sounds like part of the backlog is lack of molecular biology staff. I imagine the rape kits are DNA extraction kits, and if that's the case, I've done at least a hundred extractions over the course of my undergrad, PhD, and post doc research. They're very routine. 

I would def be willing to testify if it meant helping rape victims."
todayilearned,ffra754,t1_ffr4o63,1580153809.0,"Does anyone know why the backlog exists? I'm a post doctoral level researcher in molecular biology, and if part of the backlog is having enough people to do the actual molecular work of testing the kits, I would gladly volunteer a full day of my time every month. If it's lack of reagents for the kits, I'm sure whoever makes the kits (Invitrogen? Qiagen?) would donate kits if they could advertise to biomedical research labs something like ""your purchase helps provide free rape test kits to get through the backlog""."
