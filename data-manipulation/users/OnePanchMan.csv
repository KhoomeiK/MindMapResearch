Are you a fucking idiot? Old animals, especially ones that jump around get motor issues as they get older, if an animal is in so much pain that it doesn’t want to live, guess what, animals will make that choice and just straight up stop eating.

He mentioned in a video that he doesnt see the point of talking to babies because they dont talk back, and then mentioned thats the reason he doesnt talk to his daughter because she doesn’t respond. People figured out his daughter is like 5 or 6? So thats one issue. 

The son thing is he mentioned that he lets his son take out his anger on him when needed, so hitting onision. Then another time he mentions that his son does get angry a lot, and the son is 8-9 so should be able to express his anger properly. 

Also he mentioned that his son “gets into lots of arguments with his daughter, but he just lets it happen”, so if son gets angry and can only express it via violence, and gets into arguments with his sister, its a fair assumption."

Just like here in the UK everyone ""knew"" that Labour was going to win, because look at all the dumb things Johnson has done, and then Johnson won again."
fakehistoryporn,fed03wp,t1_feczt2r,1578992001.0,"Now are you sure that is because of what happened or your bias about the speeches?   


Because remember, I never said the Left DIDN'T make positive comments, i just said they made emotional and angry speeches, though you have to admit that the left are also usually more negative than the right.   


And again, the right talks about ""positive economy"" ect ect build a wall and it gets you all jobs yaay, something something drain the swamp, leave the EU and we have lots of money to spend on the UK Yaaay.   


Compare a lot of the Left side to those elections you will see a massive difference in how positive they are.   


People are dumb and they like positive people and positive lies."

I'm saying that right wingers lie, they promise the stars and a positive future, and that hooks people.   


The left instead have very emotional but angry speeches, and that is why the average citizen attributes the left to angry and the right to being positive and a good future."
fakehistoryporn,fecwivl,t1_fec4qch,1578987434.0,"At what point did i say policies? Re read my comment and you will see I said promises.
