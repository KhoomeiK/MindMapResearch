personalfinance,feois32,t1_fenqp99,1579300762.0,I would strongly advise against someone with no experience doing a timing belt change on their non-interference engine on their only car. You get the alignment wrong and the entire engine is toast.
personalfinance,feog7uf,t1_fenil55,1579299672.0,Honda engines are not typically non-interference. I agree on keeping at least 5K on hand though. 1K isn't even enough to cover a month of rent in most places these days.
personalfinance,feocg0s,t1_fengn84,1579298179.0,"I'd keep a minimum of a few months worth of case on hand, but yeah I'd dump the rest into the student loan. My student loan payments are around 300 a month and I swear I'll have a party once I'm done with them."
todayilearned,fenqwvj,t1_fenmir7,1579289537.0,Selling organs is dumb. Having it illegal for the hospital to help with that person's burial is even more dumb. I don't think anyone here is arguing in favor of selling organs for cash.

 Every company i've worked for has offered additional life insurance you can sign up for that's way cheaper than 25 a month. In my mid 30s they want under 2 dollars a month for 3x my salary, and 1x your salary is provided free.

Surely he'd be better off just increasing his coverage with them and pocketing the extra."

personalfinance,fenit4m,t1_fel1m3v,1579285606.0,"Yeah I ran into that as well. You'd look at a house you liked and there were 10 people making offers and the seller is bidding them against each other. Don't get me wrong, as the seller it makes sense to milk every penny out of the buyers but it does get frustrating after the 5th place you look at has this happen.

Ended up just buying with a homebuilder in a developing neighborhood because the homes were basically the same price, new, and once you and the builder agreed upon price they aren't trying to sell your house to other people for more money."

You're money is available in a short amount of time (days) not put on hold for weeks and weeks.  I did this a few years ago when collecting some of my fathers life insurance payout.
worldnews,fei7kq9,t1_fehtph7,1579132054.0,So true. While the other companies are giving blowjobs and building back doors Apple has staunchly refused to budge.
personalfinance,fei0ve1,t1_fehem1t,1579127850.0,"I feel ya there... I was living in South Austin TX a few years ago... Rent started at 1100 dollars a month and within 3 years they were asking for over 1500. I moved to a suburb where I was able to rent a house almost 2x as big for the same cost.

I too rent out rooms in my place, if you find people you can stand to be around it's great."
personalfinance,fei0l9l,t1_fehmxld,1579127682.0,"Yeah it can totally be worth it depending on your situation. Also, a lot of the pleebs out there (who don't adhere to the PF advise) treat their 401k as their savings... I had a co-worker who was 24 complaining about not having any money to do anything, he was putting 25% of his income into his 401k. Great to get a head start for a while but yeah it's not going to leave you with much cash after you pay all your bills.

When I was getting a home loan I had a offer under 3% and I was prepared to take out a loan against the 401k for this. Ultimately ended up not needing to but saving tens of thousands down the road would have been worth pulling it out for a few months. And when used for a home there is no 10% penalty..."

personalfinance,fehkqxd,t1_fegqhfe,1579118534.0,Very true. Also if you (as their child) were left with life insurance payouts they will attempt to guilt you into using it to pay off their debts. Tell em to F off. There is no legal obligation for the insurance recipient to use life insurance left directly to them for that purpose.

pcmasterrace,fednw3f,t1_fedf7zw,1579016054.0,Decent? Cable management in this system is basically inconsequential. Even in higher end systems it's typically more for your eyes than anything else. Unless cables are hitting fans it rarely makes any difference.

news,fdxzo8y,t1_fdxx64v,1578774563.0,He’s not that wrong though. So many people who are “hunters” have an automated deer feeder that spews out deer candy (corn) on a daily basis. If you’re doing this just stop pretending it’s hunting instead of harvesting.
news,fdxz6p0,t1_fdx4auo,1578774388.0,Usually it involves shooting at an animal from the road that’s on someone else’s property. Plenty of fucks to give.

LifeProTips,fca3qie,t1_fc9il8i,1577562644.0,i disagree with this. The best thing they can do is take it to a mechanic for inspection if interested in it. The typical cost in TX for a pre-sale inspection is about 50-100 bucks and most of them are weirdly excited to point out every flaw in the car.
personalfinance,fc8jmwt,t1_fc6w25a,1577536320.0,Man of those are from the 80s/early 90s they’re hardly even matching inflation right? I just plugged 250 into an inflation calculator and it popped out something like 535 dollars :(
personalfinance,fc8ir9e,t3_egq3t4,1577535793.0,If it’s with a legit home builder they’ll typically make it pretty easy. For my place I had to put earnest money down for the build of a few thousand and have proof of a mortgage approval but once you connect the lender to the builder they work together to take all your money pretty seemlessly.

worldnews,fc7lg33,t1_fc7ge3h,1577511266.0,We shouldn’t be surprised at this. The surprise just comes from the hero worship Americans like to put on members of the armed services. They are regular people just like you and me and psychopaths trickle into the military occasionally too. They just happen to be in a job where killing is sometimes part of the job and historically things get covered up both by the institution and the personnel.
Dell,fc42gq6,t1_fc40oi9,1577404881.0,"NP. I’d let whoever your main contact is at Dell know about it. I’ve spoken to my fair share of Unisys techs (the vendor they use) and Dell is pretty serious about workmanship issues like that and will push that to their manager. Especially if he pocketed “extra” screws. 

I’ve taken one of these apart and it’s a PITA but if you take your time it’s not THAT bad."
Dell,fc3o4er,t1_fc3j4gj,1577394392.0,"looks pretty easy to miss IMO. It's likely they just failed to put a cable back in properly or completely. I would call and ask for another on-site tech. With parts just in case, IDK if you are in the US but they are typically pretty good about that.
