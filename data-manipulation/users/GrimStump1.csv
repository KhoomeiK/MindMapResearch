IWantOut,ffaee1e,t3_esgo1o,1579733675.0,"I too am a fan of big cities, I lived in Toronto and loved it, but I think the real charm of Ireland lies in the small towns, on the long walking trails and out in the breathtaking landscape. 
It is a teeny tiny place, especially compared to Canada, so you're never too far from anywhere, the average rent in Dublin it's €2000 a month give or take and it's significantly lower in other cities.
Maybe consider Galway, Limerick, Cork or Waterford as a base.
Also pack an umbrella.
This was supposed to be a reply to your comment..."

 On the surface I'm fine with it, I busy myself with hobbies, interests and day to day life stuff, but deep down I feel like I would really like to have someone to share life with but like you I'm worried about hurting them and getting hurt myself, not being good enough and having too much baggage to actually enjoy a relationship without compromising myself or behaving differently around the other person just because it's what I feel they want me to do, as I have done in previous relationships."
