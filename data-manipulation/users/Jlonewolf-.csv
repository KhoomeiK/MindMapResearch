happy,fdne2dv,t1_fdlxfsn,1578583822.0,I fell in love and realized not everything was so bad. Then that person left me and it put me back deep into my depression. I then realized I couldn’t let everything that was going bad in my life consume me and I had to look on the brighter side of things and be more optimistic. And the most important thing is SELF LOVE.
