UnexpectedMulaney,ffctsty,t1_ffcrjt3,1579807114.0,"> Over the years, I‚Äôve made an observation that people who are gay and guys that are bi don‚Äôt feel the need to announce it as much as as bisexual girls do.

Why do I think what is called pride? Anyway, I understand people are proud to be a part of the community? As am I. What I‚Äôm wondering is why bisexual young women seem to feel they have to proclaim it to everyone as if that‚Äôs the only thing that identifies them?

Like I said, the gay men and women I know have other personality traits other than ‚ÄúI am gay‚Äù. However, the bisexual women I‚Äôve met make that the most prominent thing about their entire personality."
UnexpectedMulaney,ffco7nk,t1_ffck4of,1579803655.0,"Sure in this case. But I wasn‚Äôt exactly talking about this picture specifically. Just in general. In my experience, it seems they are much more adamant about making it known to everyone they meet immediately, much more often than others in the community. As if that‚Äôs the only thing they have to identify themselves. And I didn‚Äôt even say I had a problem with it. Just an observation I‚Äôve made over several years."
UnexpectedMulaney,ffcnnqp,t1_ffck6zn,1579803313.0,"This is tinder. On tinder, you set your preferences.  If you are a a gay man, even if a women swipes on your photo, you will not match because tinder will only show you guys, so there is no possibility of matching. No feelings will be hurt. 

If you are bisexual, and you swipe on a female who who also happens to swipe on you, there is a very high possibly that you are both into women. 

Either way, like I said in another comment, I am a part of the community myself. I understand it‚Äôs a part of your identity, but I‚Äôve made an observation over several years that people who are gay, and guys who are bi, do not feel the need to announce it up front as much as bisexual girls do.

There a very few bisexual girls I‚Äôve come across that didn‚Äôt make it known almost immediately. However, I have come across several gay men and women, and bi guys, who I‚Äôd known for quite some time before that revealed it to me."

WhitePeopleTwitter,ff6rmjh,t1_ff6ic0z,1579633433.0,"I see you have some reading comprehension issues, so I‚Äôll reiterate:

Most people spend days, weeks, months, or even years slowly dying. Most humans are not perfectly healthy and able bodied one minute, and then dead the next. Dying is a process. Some people get sick. Some people just get old. But spontaneous death is pretty rare. 

Those last days, weeks, etc., most people don‚Äôt want to spend alone, again, in their own shit or drool or whatever else. Some people are fortunate enough not to be conscious for that, but most people are. So you may not care about those last day after you‚Äôre already dead, but you will care about how your last days are spent while you are still living them out. 

Clearly you have never experienced the death of someone you know, but people start dying long before they are actually dead. Ever heard of hospice care? That‚Äôs what that‚Äôs for.

And physician assisted suicide is not legal in most parts of the world, so don‚Äôt pretend that just a standard option for everyone."

Emotionally / financially incapable is different than ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be bothered by someone else‚Äôs needs‚Äù.

Why is it that people who don‚Äôt want kids look down on those that do have them? As if not having children makes them a better person somehow? It doesn‚Äôt.
