KitchenConfidential,ffh5v0t,t3_etfen3,1579923953.0,"This entire problem is way bigger than individual restaurant owners. There's only so much you can charge for a cheeseburger and turn a profit. Obviously that exact price point changes based on your location.

For example:

If there are 10 boh employees and I give them all a $1/hr raise and they each work exactly 40 hours every week then that's $20,800 per year.

If my total sales are $1 million per year then giving that raise accounts for just over 2% of total sales. That's a lot for a business that's probably only operating on a 5% profit margin to begin with.

So to cover the raise I'd have to increase my prices, which might mean that I can't compete with big chain restaurants that are making a smaller profit margin but also doing many, many more millions in sales every year across the country. That probably means I'm going out of business, because I won't be able to run the business and also pay all my personal bills. A 5% profit margin on $1,000,000 in sales is only $50,000. That ain't nothing, but it ain't rich either.

Everyone regardless of their profession should earn a living wage. I'm just trying to point out that the small business owner with a million dollar per year restaurant may not be able to afford to give you another dollar. So either an bunch of underpaid jobs exist at tons of locally owned restaurants, or most of those restaurants close and significantly fewer, but well paid, jobs are available. Which leaves a lot of people without work. After awhile the market would correct itself and new restaurants would open but many people would be left jobless for a significant amount of time, perhaps years.

The problem is large and complex, and I don't know how to fix it.

P.S. I spent some time online trying to figure out what the average profit margin is for a full service restaurant in the US and every single article I looked at said between 3% and 5%. Not a single one referenced where they got those numbers. So if your google-fu is stronger than mine please link the info to me.

Also, I'm not trying to make anybody mad, and I don't own a restaurant. I'm just saying it's not that simple. If it were then it would have happened."

So let's do what we can to cool this mother down because I'm tired of sweating at 8am.

We also know that fossil fuel is finite. So let's find other alternatives now. People used to burn wood for 100% of heating and cooking. Now we have coal, natural gas, nuclear power, solar power, etc.  At some point we'll find a way to not rely on the dirtier options. Why not sooner, rather than later?
