I think part of it as well is to embrace the independence. It is totally normal and valid to feel the way you do, I've been in the exact same boat (even the crossfit part haha!). I know it sounds very lonely right now, but try going out and just doing activities by yourself. If you can occupy yourself and really just enjoy being by yourself, (in my experience). it really does attract random people to talk to you! I know it's not real life, but I'm here if you ever wanna complain about your life!"
