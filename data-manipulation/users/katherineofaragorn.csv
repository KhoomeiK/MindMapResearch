Medievalart,ff0jycq,t1_ff04l7o,1579469542.0,Thank you! What a beautiful site.
AnimalsBeingJerks,fez2r4x,t3_eqvzuv,1579453324.0,I have alopecia and this is me when I don’t put any make up/eyebrows on and just shove my wig on my head to stomp to the shops on a Sunday morning for pastries
Medievalart,fez20v3,t3_equgk2,1579453124.0,This is wonderful! Is there any more context?
GetMotivated,feq0fkc,t1_fenpdh7,1579335563.0,"I absolutely agree with you! Have had friends who have lost weight following grief, and another who had trouble gaining weight back after a long term illness. They were so hurt by people’s comments about them looking great, or being extra flirty or whatever. Thank you for bringing up the science behind this situation."
GetMotivated,fepzfwr,t1_feob7dp,1579335236.0,I don’t think fat people mind not being attractive to everyone. That doesn’t mean that you’re not being shallow or unfair by assuming someone who is fat doesn’t have their life together. That’s very different.
GetMotivated,fepyuzj,t1_feoqr29,1579334922.0,"Nah, like a lot of people who have an eating disorder for a long time, your body piles weight on in recovery. I am fat and a hundred times safer. I hope that I will keep getting healthier, but I understand if that doesn’t mean being slim after what I did to my body. Weight cycling up/down repeatedly is actually incredibly dangerous, and leads to heart problems, diabetes, etc. a lot faster than just staying a bit fat and exercising, being less stressed, and generally having a happy life. So that’s the plan!"
GetMotivated,fencsfe,t3_eq13nd,1579281923.0,"I was a neurotic, depressed, hangry mess when I was eating disorder skinny. However, people treated me much, much nicer then than now I am happy, loving my life, excited to exist and enjoying my day. I am not saying that if you’re feeling happy and healthy you won’t give off good energy, but that is not enough to over-ride the fat phobia that absolutely exists in our society! For anyone interested or who thinks they may be struggling with an eating disorder, please don’t hesitate to get help, and if you just want to explore changing your relationship with food in a calm way, check out intuitive eating as a ‘diet’ alternative."

femalefashionadvice,feg5fey,t1_fe8z8ll,1579077764.0,"It was a really cheap grab in a sale 2 years ago at Marks & Spencer (UK). About £3.50 and also a couple of sizes too big, which only helps with the piratey-ness to be honest!!"
femalefashionadvice,fe4p2g7,t1_fe4hgqn,1578861551.0,I want to learn to sew to be able to make these! I really want a sheer one but can’t find one I love. Excellent motivation to learn to sew.
femalefashionadvice,fe4opet,t1_fe42cq2,1578861443.0,Oh no! They are a Tudor dream do not take them from me!!
femalefashionadvice,fe4oggn,t1_fe43f6x,1578861364.0,"I have a single flouncy sleeve poet blouse and whenever I wear it I feel like a pirate about to have a sword fight with Byron while Shakespeare takes bets.

I am a 5’5” fat twenty something lady, but in this blouse I am a hunky pirate. It’s the best."
medieval,fddnv6p,t3_ekjqbf,1578319029.0,"It’s not a dumb question at all! I think it is a very thoughtful and important question. We romanticise Medieval life and warfare a lot in fiction and even in historical texts. It is great to remember these people were human, and to find the commonality between our ages."
dogs,fclm06g,t1_fcl1mcz,1577750924.0,"I got a rabbit as an impulse buy at age 20. Incredibly irresponsible and I was so unprepared for her, but she saved my life so many times. We had 7 years together and she was the light in a very dark world more times than I can say. I lost her this year and I miss her so much, my depression has definitely been hitting harder without her gorgeous face in the world. I have fibromyalgia which can cause extreme fatigue and has a role in depression also, and I am very wary of getting a dog because of the massive physical commitment. I 100% want to have a pet again when I am done with Grad school, but will only consider a small pet or possibly a cat. I know a dog and some types of cats will be too much for me. Small animals generally need little or no (walking) exercise and can be played or allowed to run around at home, have much cheaper vet bills, their food can be bought at your local store, and it’s so much easier to spoil them and feel like a good owner when their toys/treats are so much cheaper than dogs and cats. 

I really hope this helps, I don’t recommend impulse buying a pet or animal but also remember that the negative voice in your head might be louder than the small fragile hope that life can be better. 

Good luck whatever you choose!"
science,fclij3h,t1_fcladzu,1577748596.0,"Similar for me too with Fibromyalgia, although I do understand completely that this is not the same as MS. My mind went straight to the benefits for those needing extended hospital stays, bed rest, or using wheelchairs to get around. Hopefully there is potential here if not for us then for future generations!"
offmychest,fc8djcy,t1_fc6k8vn,1577532488.0,"Hi, I definitely agree with other people regarding getting your own specialist therapy, but I also wanted to share something my therapist helped me with regarding this. 

As I got older I started to physically resemble my abuser, and looking in the mirror or seeing photographs of myself was incredibly triggering. My therapist (who was a specialist in the type of parental abuse I survived) recommended I start thinking about who else from all those hundreds of generations before my parent might have had this nose, or this eye colour, or my hands. These people gave us gifts from so long ago. Maybe some of them were good people, like we are trying to be. So actually this isn’t my abuser’s nose, it’s my awesome great great great grandma’s who was super cool and kind and would be so proud of knowing her nose has come down to a super cool and kind person like me. 

Your abuser doesn’t own your voice, or your face, or your body, or you. I really hope this helps even a bit, it really helped me take ownership of myself and reduce the shadow of my abuser a bit. 

Best wishes"
medieval,fbxk95r,t3_eeoysx,1577191415.0,"Most likely either a decorative Victorian reproduction, or possibly an ethnographic object collected/stolen (depending on your approach) from an indigenous culture following contact with colonisers. A lot of indigenous populations traded for iron and other metals and developed show weapons like this following contact. Hope that’s interesting! In terms of keeping it, just don’t let it get wet or keep it in a place which is damp and it should be fairly okay. If you want to go down that route you could look into coatings but they’re all pretty nasty chemicals and are best avoided unless you work in a museum lab and have controls for them. Enjoy your cool object, and good for you for showing it some love!"
science,fb7smz4,t1_fb7rjj4,1576598451.0,"I’m so sorry people have told you this, in my opinion the only bad singing is someone who is hurting their voice or is singing mean songs! Think of it this way - you wouldn’t think of yourself as a bad saxophonist if you’d only picked the instrument up once or twice, so don’t write yourself off for singing until you’ve had someone help you figure the instrument out. I recommend finding a nice, relaxed choir with no auditions to start with. You can hide a bit while you g get your confidence up. If you’re worried about too many people though you can always start out with one to one lessons, and explain your nervousness. Just find someone who has the right attitude and is really supportive of you and you’ll have loads of fun! Good luck on your forays into the musical world."
