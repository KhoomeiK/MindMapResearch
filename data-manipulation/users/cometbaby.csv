MurderedByWords,fgqdrdq,t1_fgqctag,1581022262.0,"My cultural bias has me internally screaming at that age of consent, but no judgment because I don’t want to assess your culture under my cultural standards. I am curious though, has that been an issue in your personal experience?"
MurderedByWords,fgqd17a,t1_fgq1vef,1581021942.0,"I understand that completely. I can’t speak for your parents as I’m not them and I don’t know them, but I’m happy they’ve had such a successful relationship. As someone who has an age gap in my relationship, I get sick of people telling me he’s too old for me. I feel your pain. 

I think people like screaming pedophilia when they *might* mean that it’s a power dynamic issue. In these cases where the younger person in the relationship is still in their mid teens and the other person is about 10 years older, it could be pedophilia, but it could also be something like a narcissist seeking an easy target to control. 

However, every case is different. That’s just my perspective on the troubles people might be worried about."
MurderedByWords,fgq9jpl,t1_fgq2v68,1581020390.0,I could be wrong but I don’t think there’s any legal action that can be taken if there’s no proof of them exchanging sexual pictures or engaging in sexual activities. At least I don’t think so in the US.

I’ve never seen any of my male coworkers get yelled at and the harassment is usually much less frequent (still happens but not as much). I’ve had more creepy patrons than I have rude ones but damn I’ve had some awful experiences. One lady yelled at me because her food came out before she finished her salad, and I mean she screamed at me so loudly that the entire restaurant heard her. A creepy example of the guy who asked to see my work permit because 12 year olds aren’t old enough to work then immediately asked me to go home with him after I told him I was 18.

todayilearned,ffyiupk,t1_ffyhpft,1580347467.0,This could’ve been a rumor but I believe Dolly made it known that she wouldn’t interview with anyone who didn’t respect their privacy. That might be something my brain just made up though.

todayilearned,ffygp39,t1_ffybshe,1580346001.0,"Part of the reason no one talks about him because of exactly what you said. He’s introverted and enjoys his privacy.

niceguys,ffsx2uz,t1_ffstqw3,1580196028.0,I once had a guy (my cousin’s friend) hit on me while standing over my dying grandmother saying what we seriously thought was goodbye.

I felt the need to always mention how much I had eaten that day or eating more than I might’ve if I had been eating alone to prove some weird point I didn’t need to prove. 

I make it a point to not comment on how other people look as far as body composition unless they bring it up first. If someone says they are fat I’ll say something like “I think you look wonderful but if you are unhappy with the way you look then I’m more than happy to help you come up with a plan to change that.”

thanksimcured,ffmkjdz,t1_ffltssj,1580055937.0,Right?? My family has a history of having stupid high metabolisms until they just shut off pretty suddenly. That meant that I was the only small one left in the family and I felt so out of place. My parents obviously saw that I ate but other family members were super concerned. I ate a snack in every class period in high school and three meals a day but still nothing. My dad always told me that I shouldn’t consider myself an unhealthy weight unless I felt unhealthy (which I didn’t).

It sucked and I was miserable.
