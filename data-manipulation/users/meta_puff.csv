facepalm,fgu0f2g,t1_fgtk13w,1581111729.0,Sorry buddy but I think this comment will be buried and unread by most. I really do appreciate this and I'll try my best to look into that website with the anti Peta propaganda.
facepalm,fgstzfg,t1_fgsrqqf,1581092614.0,Never underestimate the human ability to simply follow a hivemind. Peta bad.

facepalm,fgjlac0,t1_fgish6t,1580846376.0,I don't get why you guys are having such a hard time talking while peeing. If you're that afraid of being gay just say no homo.

dankchristianmemes,fg3g5if,t1_fftahrg,1580480683.0,Not at all. What would we have done as pacifists while Nazi Germany was expanding in Europe?

Romans 1:18–20 (ESV): For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. 

Romans 2:1–5 (ESV): Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things. Do you suppose, O man—you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God? Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed."

Instagram,ffy7rzw,t3_evuiuf,1580340220.0,"Pretty cool topic, I'm looking forward to your results.

As a small criticism, I'm using mobile and couldn't zoom in during the video so couldn't see some smaller details..

I wonder about my result, I typically am pretty removed from the false models hype.

I also don't think this is the best place or sub to get people to answer your questionnaire, try looking elsewhere?

Good luck."
