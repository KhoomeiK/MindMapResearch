lifehacks,ffpoqfy,t3_eubthi,1580100570.0,We portion out family size purchases of every kind of meat for the 2 of us and then vacuum seal them using a FoodSaver. The quality is better since the vacuum allows you to store the meat longer with no icing. We purchased it about 4 years ago and it has definitely paid for itself several times over. We get 50' rolls of bagging material and each roll last about a year. Much cheaper than those ZipLock bags.

We got married at 19 in 1974. We came into the marriage with no debt but with very different ideas of how money should be spent/saved. We always butted heads and kind of still do on some things. When I think of all the money he's wasted over the years, I get sad about what we could have accomplished if he were just more frugal. 

I've developed coping strategies to get him to think about some of the really egregious things he used to do in the past. It hasn't stopped all of his bad habits--but it has slowed them down."

Hubby and I were not in on any of the adoption discussion. I'm not sure if the size/growling claims (he does growl while playing, but it's butt up/tail wagging when he's doing it) was just their way of trying to back out of the adoption due to buyers remorse.

Even after Banjo went berserk, Rex was calm and was just trying to back away from him. I've played and cuddle with Rex for a day and half and he is a typical young dog (about a year old, I'd guess)--he just wants to play and cuddle. He was sitting on my lap and laying on me several times today. He even let me give him belly rubs.  I may be off on the 50 lbs. He certainly is as tall as Banjo but bigger boned.  

Yep, I know about the lack of knowledge about ACDs. The rescue said Banjo was ACD/Dalmatian mix. (And probably more than that.) The vet said there were no ACDs in Ohio. UMMM then why do we have 2 of them? Both adopted in Ohio?

We've had multiple dogs most of the time over the years. We never did show any of them the deceased body as they all had to be euthanized and were cremated.

I retired in October, 2015. I was getting ready to donate my ""office"" clothes b/c I wouldn't be needing them any more. I got as far as putting them in a box and figured when I fill up the box, I'd donate it. Well, life went on and in the spring of 2016, my aunt passed away. I went to my closet to find something to wear to the calling hours and funeral. UMMMM where are all my dark slacks????

Oh, ya! They are in the donation box.

Needless to say, I pulled out several of the nicest slacks to keep on hand for this type of occasion.
