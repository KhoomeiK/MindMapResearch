pokemon,ffcg14r,t1_ffcf9ms,1579798669.0,It definitely feels like easier game play. But I just caught a wild Eevee.... Can't beat that
pokemon,ffcb96b,t1_ffcacm8,1579795705.0,"Thank you!! I have a Pikachu sweatshirt too, so I could make it a whole look!"
pokemon,ffcb5sx,t1_ffc9w40,1579795646.0,"I skipped X & Y as I had heard much better stuff about sun & moon, and I knew I wanted to get the ultra. I plan on going back and playing gen VI eventually. There's a lot of changes since B/W 2 but I'm really enjoying this region and would definitely recommend it!!!"
pokemon,ffcaxaa,t1_ffc94lx,1579795495.0,Thank you! They're truly just great games for any age. I still have my original Gameboy color and red cartridge! Red still works but unfortunately Crystal has lost its ability to hold save files... It was a sad day
pokemon,ffcar0i,t1_ffc8yee,1579795385.0,"I've really enjoyed it so far. Great attention to detail, good graphics and I love the variety of Pokemon, lots of old favorites. Its a lot of dialogue and the game play is a bit easier, would be my two biggest complaints, and the lack of standard gym battles is weird to get used to."
pokemon,ffcai75,t1_ffc8ucg,1579795231.0,Thank you for not thinking I'm old then lol

pokemon,ffc3an5,t1_ffc2nia,1579790481.0,"Thank you!!! I'm really enjoying the graphics and variety of pokemon so far, though the game play seems easier... but maybe that's just bc I'm 23 now lol"
pokemon,ffc3789,t1_ffc2lgx,1579790411.0,"What? That old people and girls play Pokemon??? I'm a double threat, lol."

He could tell by my face I wasn’t expecting it to go so smoothly and then got a giant grin and yelled “AYYYYYE LETS GO”. Which was awful but adorable"
dci,fe2ea22,t3_eng4wi,1578837397.0,My first year marching I almost didn’t go to my callback camp because I didn’t think I was good enough... then I got a spot. Remember so much of the battle is just WANTING to be good and having a teachable attitude. Best of luck!
