I had to learn to cry again and its not glorious to do but it keeps you from looking like you fell into a cheesegrater\^\^ Want to talk about whats bothering you?

Seriously this is the wrong place to find people to help you kill yourselfe. Open to talk tho"
SuicideWatch,fdlth8s,t3_em1rvb,1578532107.0,"Hey OP, you are strong for making it this far despite all this shit!

You are between a rock and a hard place from what you tell... I get it, you are stuck with them because your parents arent there for you/even take it out on you. Its a shitty situation because you cant complain like you should (on one hand) but cant leave them either. Or can you? Would it be possible for you to move out and live cheap somewhere? Get a job or get social assistance from the goverment?

I was strongly advised to move out of my parents homes at 16 and in hindsight it would have keept me sane(r). Its a dive into unknown waters but maybe worth it.

Worst (and I mean a push comes to shove solution) would be to gather... persuasion material from your aunt. Like she does drink and drugs apperently so she can also lose custody of her remaining daughters which she seams to cherish a lot more then she does you, unfortunatelly. Its not nice but so arent they and family taught me that trust isnt a thing but blackmail gives you leverage. Still it puts you out in open confrontation and should be used as a last resort.

Oh stranger pls dont starve yourselfe! I had a close friend in school who did the same and some harder cases when i was hospitalised. Its heartbreaking to see young women turn into skeletons and still have a warped view of their body. You dont only starve yourselfe now but it can also keep you from having children in the future and your bones turn to paper. My friend lena started faling into anorexia because she was just good at dieting and it became the only thing she felt beeing good at... Beautiful woman now and she overcame it but its a path into madness. Took her years to stop counting calories. I knew a girl in closed ward that was sitting in a wheelchair and was still collecting her urine ( it has byproducts of the digestive metabolism so they checked it every day and she tried to cheat her way to... idk death/her birthweight?). You need help or this might kill you sooner then anything you can think of.

Life seams fucked right now for you but there is a later! I know its a shallow hope when even thinking about tomorrow makes you vomit but its still there, you just need to find a way to get out of there. Feels like a fucked up version of cindarella and you might not get a fairy changing your life but there is a world beyond the evil step mother, so to speak.

I would miss you now that I know your story and I am shure there are plenty others that will! Hit me up if you want to talk. Talking doesnt change reality but sometimes sharing the pain is enough to bear with it.

I hope this finds you well stranger and lots of love <3 If this did help you in any capacity pls eat a bite or two for me. I am serious."
SuicideWatch,fdlie3q,t1_fdlfjz6,1578524687.0,"You do have a point that it depends on the person who you are asking what their meaning of life is. I tought about it long and hard and it wasnt easy.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm\_2zmX6Akc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm_2zmX6Akc)  <-- Jordan Peterson about depression. I recommend this a lot but he has a very rational way of building from a foundation of logic. Take your time and work through his stuff.

I know the situation of feeling alone in a crowd of people but if you search you way through literature and philosopy you find a lot of people dealing with nihilism. We arent the first and wont be the last, I guess. I found it amazing that smarter people then me also struggled with the meaning of life so its humane in a way and thus I can feel related to people.

Life might be a tragedy but you can prevent it from becoming hell by preventing unnecessary suffering. It might become worse but the difference can also be that you feel equiped to overcome coming struggles."

SuicideWatch,fdlc025,t1_fdl9uzo,1578520787.0,I have my struggles and chronic depression but helping makes me feel good and I kinda treat this as a mental exercise. It forces me to search for positive things because I may not care much about my life but other peoples life is precious! There are many things and many ways to overcome strife and learning to think like that is a kind of behavioural therapy. Makes me feel exhausted from time to time but also happy and better.

SuicideWatch,fdlb2wa,t3_elz836,1578520238.0,"Hey OP, its fine to ask questions that bother you.

I found this recently and I think its even better then some clinical scales (besides the ones where you just have to answer many questions befor you get a result) in my humble opinion  [https://emmengard.com/2019/05/07/suicide-scale/](https://emmengard.com/2019/05/07/suicide-scale/)  Its a suicide scale that describes various stages of feeling down/ wanting out. In a classical sense the wish to die can be split into two aspects. Aktively pursuing or passively wishing. Aktive would be that you buy things necessary for you to end your life and passively it would be things like crossign the streets without looking at all or just going for risks in order to die as an ""accident"".

For the meaning of life... Idk to be honest. It has as much meaning as you chose to give it. For me its helping people in my social circle which will get better and maybe help others in their social circle to get better and be an posiitve influence and one person at a time the world should be a better place. Its not much but I can live with it. What would make your life better and what did you always want to do in your life? Good experiences make for a better feeling and if you keep them in mind it makes for a happier life and memories."
SuicideWatch,fdl9o3n,t3_elza3q,1578519419.0,"And I hope it will be less tomorrow. Thank you for staying with us and giving life another shot! It wont be all good from today till tomorrow but a bit better or just not getting worse is something one can start of with!

SuicideWatch,fdl7zy9,t3_elz1tr,1578518596.0,I commented on your last post and I see that a certain bag went missing but is this a form of wanting friendship very very much or is it something stronger?
SuicideWatch,fdl71nx,t3_elxto2,1578518135.0,"I have seen a lot of shit, been through a lot of shit and read even more shit but your story OP... Idk where to start honestly. Your mother tried to slit your troath and you still care for her till her last day? Wow! My dear mother is a witch to put it mildly but I broke of contact years ago for much less, compared to yours. You have a giant heart OP and so much love and care it borders on masochism.

You werent selfish by chosing yourselfe and not having the baby. I get your angle on things but somewhere you have a right to draw a line. If your man at the times started to spiral downwards and threatend to harm you/or the baby its very possible that he wouldnt have been a good father or just bashed you/your kids head in while beeing high and drunk. Also pardon my  language but in what kind of shithole country do you live in where rape is okay or neglected in any form?! I have seen what it did to people... its horrible. Like all the light and hope snuffed out from their eyes and lifes, everything defiled that took a lifetime to build. Fuck this mentality seriously.

You helped so many losers and just the fact that you dont want to kill yourselfe just because its to expensive on your family is heartbreaking. I love that such good people like you are still on this world but I so do wish you had some better reason or some hope to keep you here. I can relate to not crying at work and looking forward to cry at home\^\^ Sometimes describes my days all to well.

I just want to hug you right now but I cant, but I feel required to give you some kind of recommendation on what to do in a practical way aswell. So we have established that you care very much about other people. Thats good(!) to a certain degree at least. You are free to care about others but you should also care about you. Looks like no one is looking out for you so you got to be good to yourselfe aswell. If you help and just give up all your needs and wantings its selfeless as well as destructive. Your needs matter as much as everyone elses do and at the end of the day you deserve to be a bit ""selfish"" just to keep reaching for your hopes and dreams. Its a human right and even one of the aknowledged basic human needs!

Next thing in line is that you seam to have a bad hand with partners... No shame in that but there are people out there that are predators. Bullies look for people who just step aside and can be bossed around. They misstake kindness for weakness  so you have to draw a line sometimes! Love and relationships is working together to help each other to fulfill your lifes and dreams. Its not batman and robin where one is just the sidekick to the boss. I do know you arent weak OP, you couldnt be with all that you have been through, but you should never again step aside for someone that just wants to use you and be happy at  the cost of your happiness. Chose people carefully and carry your head held high and with confidence for you have nothing to be ashamed of. Maybe you cant find it in you to love yourselfe and I can relate aswell to this, but there aint no person around that can treat you like trash! No one, no sir! You deserve respect, and if not for all you did in your life and people you cared for, then just because you are a very worthy human beeing. I tell you all this because I hope it helps you to find confidence that you deserve better!

 Pls chose life and if at any point you want to talk or feel like crying then message me! We can cry together while still beeing alive. I love you stranger and if i could wish upon a star then Id wish for you to get better <3"
SuicideWatch,fdl1cxu,t3_ely0iu,1578515344.0,"Okay hold your horses! You cant blackmail someone into friendship or make them pay by dying, because they didnt chose to be friends.

Its nice and all that you want to spent time and money on her but you cant by friendship. Well you can in a way but people will just love you for your gifts and not for you beeing you.

Age doesnt make so much difference at this age honestly. You are both developed and should be in similar stages of your life. Sharing interests or problems is a better cohesive in my opionion.

What is an exit bag? Sounds like one of those bags you see in spy movies with currency of different countries and fake passports. Or I am missing the obvious (but not recommendable) bag over your head scenario?

I might overstep with this and I apologise befor hand but do I sense some sexual undertones? Like I have been saying stupid stuff when face with the right girl and I can sometimes relate to the feeling of ""dont fuck this up"" when chosing an adequate topic of conversation with a lady (turns out women arent as much into 40k as they should be... Heretics).

Friendship is above looks, luckily. Otherwise this might be a very lonely planet where all the beautiful people hamster friendships with each other.

The thing is people sometimes think that others wont miss them and all that crap but you dont always know what you mean to a person. I had a dude kick a football against my head resulting in a concussion that left me in the hospital for 2 days (medium concussion and just throwing up) and I tought he was an asshole all his life. Drunk driver ran him over some months later and despite me not liking the guy at all he didnt deserve to die! If I ended up missing this retarded fucker imagine how it is to lose family. Suicide isnt known to be helpful when dealing with death either.

If you are feeling down (maybe depressed) its a common thing to feel like a burden on everybody and all would be better without you etc etc. Thats bullshit! There are so many supportive people that would miss you alot and even if you see yourselfe as a burden you are a support for others. Its helped me to find friends that are in similar situations and mindsets then you are now and then lean on each other and share. You might keep an eye out so you dont drag each other down but to lift each other up. Each person might feel like a burden but they dont feel the same for their mate.

Try writing down your toughts! It helps you keep the shitstorm in your mind in order and its easier to find out whats really at the core of some issues. Paper is very patient so it always has time for you\^\^

SuicideWatch,fdk3nqi,t3_eltbkt,1578495270.0,"Hey OP, the situation and feelings might suck but at least you are aware of it.

My humble opinion is that the stress turned things towards something worse so its not out of the blue so to say. The breakfast episode sounds like a panik attack to me (had them myselfe). If you get one again try to slow your breahting or breath in a bag. If you hyperventilate you enrich your blood with to much oxygen which in return makes you feel light headed and agitated. If you reinhale your breath you also inhale co2 thus lowerering oxygen levels a bit while still hyperventilating.

Get some help stranger, I strongly advise you. Idk how old you are but for me it also started in puberty. There are a lot of things going on emotionally and physiologically (neurons maturing in your brain for example) so you have a fair chance to turn stuff around and also limiting the mess that stress and negative cognitions (aka patterns of thinking) can cause in your brains metabolism (every mental disorder is a combination of an abnormal state of brain metabolism and a abnormal way of thinking or perception).

It might not sound very uplifting but crying is healthy to a degree. If you eat everything up and its just all festering in your soul it makes you sicker. After cutting myselfe I had to learn how to cry again so I dont lock everything inside or use destructive methods of copeing.

What you might have felt is the fear of the unknown or generally that all is going to shit and a quick way out of life is the only way out of the situation but its not! There always is a way but you might not see it just now. You musstnt let yourselfe be pushed out of life by fear OP. It sounds easy but its the hardest lesson.

Ask friends or family of you can get help or if they help you get help for yourselfe. Its easier to readjust your life when you arent scared shitless, trust me.

I hope this finds you well stranger."

It can be hard and every relationship takes effort and for me personally I dont allways take the effort tbh. Still I am suprised by people that care and help you. If push comes to shove you better get along on your own. Thats the basics, but everyone that assists you in pain and hardship is a gift from the world. You can chose to care and put in effort and if people dont get it or even aprecciate it a little then well fuck it... You still reached out with an helping hand and arent to blame for things not working out. Sometimes realtionships end but may it be love/friendship/family its important to still keep your hand stretched out.

Idk I just know a thing or two about psychology so I think if a propper doctor evaluates that you migh be suffering from a permanent illness that is to painful to live with... its different then if your own toughts just drive you into doing mad things. Worst case you get medicinal oversight and maybe help. Hell I read that it takes some 5 years or so till dignitas has you evaluated for even beeing accepted into all this so its plenty of time to get help, get better or even get healthy again. In a weird way I use it to focus on getting better. Shure death is still a thing but you have a safe way out and getting cared for. They have a lot of people that never take the assisted death but use it as a sense of security. I think it sounds nice not the have to flee out of your life and loved ones. Anything can be used as a tool or motivation man. You just need to think how different ideas or philosopys can benefit you in your situation. End goal is always to find ways to conque life not conquer death.

Sometimes I find myselfe funneling me into a situation that just makes me more and more depressive and well insane. To force myselfe to see death as the only way out of this new and ""improved"" version of the hell I created.

If you feel so powerless then at least your missery is of your own making and I get that weird reasoning that comes with all that but its still bad for you. Yes its easier to just dig a bunker lock yourselfe in it and then wait to die all alone and misserable then to deal with the world and just life itselfe...

If you are feeling terrible and hate feeling like this and further hate yourselfe because of all that then its just bound to take you down in this spiral.

A improved version of thinking like this would be: I am feeling misseable and I hate feeling misserable and I kinda think its my own fault. OKAY thats how it is in the moment. Not great but thats how it is. NOW what can I do to improve my status quo? Hate feeling like this? Okay I try to do sports or talk to people that understand me or something that lifts your mood ( I am no mindreader so insert anything that makes you feel better).

You helped a lot of people and stayed strong for them but its also your turn to get help and be listened to. You deseve it, like it or not!

Life isnt about beeing happy or sad in my opinion and i think happiness isnt a gruanted right or achieveable by anyone. Life is shit and then you die but for me its feeling capeable to deal with stuff that comes your way and beeing confident that you can overcome problems (yeah still working on that btw).

SuicideWatch,fcir6yr,t3_ehdush,1577667877.0,"Hey OP, puberty is a bitch.

So first of all I \`d say that sending nudes is a big nono. If you still want to do it then never put your head in the picture or other identifying points like tatoos or that birthmark that reads: Tenacious D (look up the band if you dont know)\^\^

It sounds a bit like you try to find validation from a purely external side. Female friends of mine post kinky stuff on the internet or go on tinder after a breakup or something destabilized their confidence in them to get validation just for their body.

I think its a weird trend tbh and while i am 100% not complaining about a grown woman beeing nude and sharing it , it feels a lil shallow to me. There is more that makes a person then just the physical hull so to say. I dont know why one would limit themselfes just to that. You have a lot of interests and seam to be in that phase of puberty where you are discovering what people find attractive in you. Thats okay but maybe share your nudity with someone you grew to trust or isnt a stranger at least. If you feel insecure about xyz on your body or charakter then change it to a way you feel good about it. Internal validation is more important then external sometimes. Confidence is something very attractive in a woman.

Sometimes you see things different then another person would (eg I hooked up with a very intoxicating girl i bumbed to at random and one of her boobs was bigger then the other so she had doctor sanctioned surgery to adjust the samler boob to the bigger ones size. Great I know\^\^ It left a scar around her nipple but it was no big deal for me. She was super ashamed of it and kinda shy all of a sudden, where for me it just wasnt ugly at all. I showed her that i love all of her body the way it is and she was very happy and grateful for that. It was a bigger deal in her mind then it was for me. She just limited herselfe to that scare where she was a sweet frea... woman as a whole person).

No one is perfect and thats just how it is. You can just be the best you that you want to be. All the stress and stuff you went through were valuable experiences and I am shure you wouldnt look down on other people because of some minor imperfections on their body now. Ofc if someone looks like a heroine addict in the body of frankensteins monster then you are still free to find them unatractive/kill it with fire.

I selfharmed for years and I know the fake feeling of controll it gives you but it just leaves you with scars that are reminders of bad choices. I still have a lot over my whole body and thats where I am insecure because it tells a sad story of its own and I am ashamed of what I did and people can see it for the rest of my life. I dont find it ugly on other people/girls because I know what its like but I wish I could erase that part of my life cut into my body. Dont cut yourselfe, it gives you nothing besides addiction to it and reminders of hard times.

I know its confusing and I was about your age when I got depression so I know a bit or two about it. Try to find an interesting boy/girl/person (whatever floats your boat really) and take it slow. I had my first time with my gf at that time and I remember it fondly to share intimite things and physicall exploration with a person you love and trust.

Value yourselfe in more things then just your body Op and maybe take it a bit slower. My most important lesson is that love can hurt people in profound ways so honesty and trust is sometimes shitty but the way to go. Stay safe."

SuicideWatch,fcik4d9,t1_fcii4wp,1577663891.0,"I am glad I can help in some way! If you dont mind I would like to have a smal insight into what makes you consider suicide.

For therapy and therapists its important to find someone you can really open up to. I know its hard because therapists are often filled to the brim with patients and you cant be really picks sometimes but your health is important to find the right healer so to say.

I do care more about other peoples lifes then I sometimes do about mine and helping them kinda forces me to be positive aswell and see things from a more uplifting angle. I know how it is to just be negative when you actually want to be a positive influence for people you interact with.

Hope this finds you well."
SuicideWatch,fcig0gp,t3_ehd9sm,1577661969.0,"Sometimes you just discover that stuff is weird but it kinda turns you on. Its all nice and dandy if you dont hurt anyone (without their consent at least) and you share it with likeminded hot people. I guess you discover your boundaries while you explore your sexuality. Had a gf that liked to be slapped and if she ask for it its okay with me but then she said to slap her in the face and that was also okay. Ended up slapping her very hard (her borderline dissorder might have played into it) but I felt shity for  not only hitting someone in the face, which i find very disrespectful in general, but also I didnt want to slap or choke the shit out of her. Its only fun if both like it and respect the others wishes. We talked about it and sex was still very satisfactory after that.

Use protection and say no when you dislike something but also say yes when it tingles your bits. Bonus points for not fucking nazis and asshole people\^\^"
SuicideWatch,fci9lp6,t3_ehcaoc,1577659429.0,"OP your attitude and will to keep on going is somthing I admire!

You developed copeing mechanisms like social interaction, healthy relation towards substances and writing to sort your mind. This is bigger step then you might fully aknowledge it to be.

Sometimes life feels like one of those tower defense games where wave after wave comes crushing down on you and you see the wear and tear on your defenses so to say. Its not that the waves will ever end or you get unscaved through all of them but to the simple knowledge and feeling that you can deal with each wave. Like sailing a smal ship into a storm while laughing like a madman.

Yeah people move on and you can adapt to every madness in some horrific way but its easiert to not have to really. Life hasnt any more sense then you give it. Maybe your fight is to not become an aditional suiced for people to have to deal with. Even better is to have a helping hand in the fight against lifes nighmares. MAybe you choose to be that hand. Life is fleeting and you could argue that after 3 generations no one knows your name anyways, still you can be a positive force for people you care about and make their life better. They make your life better and their friends so you reach a lot of people and make a lot of lifes better. This could lead to a positive chain reaction. I know  its not much but often enough for me to keep on going.

I wont give you tips on how to die and I guess your post will be deleted because of the nature of your questions but I think posts like yours are very important to still get answered.

Haf an employeship in a psych ward when I was studying and a patient also tried to slit their wrist and lost a lot of blood (dont know how much exactlly but enough to shut her down). You can still be safed by a lot of IV fluid and if you survive you have like a calling card for suicide on your arm every following day of your life.

If I could ask you for something then it would be that you try tp procrastinate killing yourselfe. Watch a movie take a nap (taking 2 sleeping pills and waking up again is better then taking 20 and not waking up again), just dont do stuff in the heat of your suffering.

Ofc you should get help or therapy etc etc. If you broke your leg you would go to a doc 2 right? You can try to get better a bit each day. Do stuff that makes you happy or fullfills you. Reward yourselfe for beeing good to yourselfe and going a step closer to your  dreams. If you are to down to have dreams or hope its okay man!

I like to think that a therapist has to have more knowledge of mental dissorders then their patients because thats the whole point. Idealy they point you in an direction and work out the single steps you can take to get to a better (head)space. You still have to go and coaching is senseless if you dont act uppon it. At least you have to give it a shot and I know it sucks to do stuff when you are down but I personally see things getting worse if you just get apathetic and sulk. If I was the admin of the world so to say I \`d be glad to just snap my fingers and turn it into a world where no one  is lacking anything be it food friends health or happiness. Life isnt that way tho.

If someone tells you to get a job then its not like the flextape meme where you just slap a bandaid on an issure and its fixed. Its more: Hey If money is an issue i belive that you can change your job or get better education so you might achieve a better lifestyle. If you dont want to... Your decission. If there are problems or issues in the way well sucks but at least you see them and maybe can change or overcome the problem.

Same with sadness. You cant be happy just because you were ordered to but you can look in that direction and see what makes you happy. Sports do you good? Hey man how about going for a run once a week or join a football club! If you dont want to then its wasted advice ofc. If you see changeable situations things and feelings then we can help you make a plan but its still your life, your shoes and your steps to take. First step is taking responsebility (I know it sucks).

Idc how old you are because you feel misserable from time to time, dont you? So you are free to do something but neither I nor anybody can tell you to. Your life your choice. Take advices and help or dont.

Its like a cake where you hand out slices but no one sees the whole cake or picture so to say. Maybe a little some times makes it easier for you. Try to find people in similar situations or with greater understanding of mental issues (get positively crazy friends). Family are random people you didnt chose to be with tbh. I think family should be a place where you are respected loved understood and cherished. For me it were my friends so I call them family. Trust should be earned and honesty rewarded... Just because they raised you doesnt mean they earned your trust. Maybe the opposite

Holidays with the whole family together and the iron clad idea that it has to be perfect and still peaceful puts a lot of stress on people.

Can you talk about it with any family member? Often it helps when you can share your pain and find help together! Its okay that you feel that way so no need to put pressure on yourselfe because/while you are hurt anyways.

If you live alone you might want to collect all pointy toxic stuff etc and put it out of sight since staring at that knife doesnt make not chosing suicide easier. Its not forever but a temporary solution to a hopefully temporary problem. As always get professional help. There are doctors/therapists that studied hard to heal the mind of people in pain so it would be such a waste to let their couches collect dust, wouldnt it?

If you find yourselfe making plans and collecting tools to act out that plan please consider hospitalising yourselfe. I know closed ward is like jail with more psychotic rambling (at least where i come from) but better have some gray walls for some days then be in a gray box forever. Sleeping helps aswell with calming down and get some distant to strong urges timewise. Gotta survive the peaks\^\^

SuicideWatch,fcazkct,t3_egyeqz,1577579724.0,"Hey OP, I love your dark humor!

Yeah I know it would end all your suffering for good and permanent sollutions dont require to look after them ever again. I think the more important lesson is that suicide is a choice you cant bounce back from really. Shure there isnt a chance to regret having killed yourselfe (because thats the whole point now isnt it?) but you also shut down any chance of having a good moment/feeling/person ever in your life again. You might be shure in your heart or brain that it never will get better but never is a bitch statistically speaking. It has the same chances as ""Everything allways will be like a soft summer breeze in my life"" Thats sounds ridiculous doesnt it?

I am not saying you should soldier through the shitstorm you might feel your life is from time to time but more to be open for new options and see ladders where you saw chaos some time ago.

In video game terms its like restarting your speedrun because you didnt get that bomb under 5 mins and cant glitch to ganondorf because that mob hit you to much and it looks to bleak to make a perfect run. Shure its anoying and maybe impossible (idk thats where my zelda speedrun metaphore starts wobbling) but your life isnt a perfect speedrun is it? Are you rooting for the guy that beats people flawlessly in mortal combat or that underdog that beats the oponent with just a sliver of health left? People love a good comback story and shure it requires much more effort then if all fell into place right away but no one remembers the speedruns that got restarted half way through. Think about fighting/creating in the game you are in now because chances are you wont restart/wont be the same game but you just threw away your whole pc (or console for pesants).

The wish for suicide is trifold in my opinion. The wish for an end to problems/suffering, the wish for death obviously and the wish for peace/ having a break. Maybe a little break would do you good so you dont have to go all the way.

Hope this finds you well OP"
SuicideWatch,fcawwks,t1_fcau226,1577578221.0,"When I was in open ward (at 16 or so) there was a girl named laura and she was super shy and also had some form of anxiety dissorder from what i can recall. So one day we were in the gymn at the ward and they had some boxing gloves. So I just put them on and she did aswell and I did some punching exercises where she used my gloves as target and stuff. In the beginning she was super shy and didnt punch seriously (she was skinny and like 1.65m), but then I encouraged her to do propper punching since I wanted her to train propperly. Once she got into it she fuckn gave her ALL and hit really well. After the training she was back to her shy normal selfe but I like to think she showed me that shy people have a lot in them but they dont advertise it at all. Its rewarding to get to know shy people. Just need to find out what you want to do and just give it your all.

There are a lot of ways you can get therapy without your parents knowing (or beeing able to refuse) but I get ya, its nice to have the support. My dad was very understanding in his way when I needed him to get therapy. He said: Son if you break a leg then you go to a doctor. Your mind isnt anything different so there is no need to feel ashamed (social stigmata is still very common with mental dissorders sadly).

Maybe you should join a club outside of school? Like a playground to learn how to deal with people and then school can be your battlefield so to say. Small stepps I guess. I dont have social anxiety but I know how fear can paralyse you (thats why  I didnt finish my bachelors I guess). In retrospect I see how facing your fears, like 1 fear a day, can give you nice results. Idk how old you are but girls are like anybody else really. Same fears hopes and dreams as you, they just make you act like a retard from time to time\^\^ Even happens when you talked to a lot of girls years later.

I know its easy to say, fuck other peoples opinions, but especially puberty and school is a lot about finding social circles and fitting in. One of my best friends at university was super akward! Still one of the best people I know and a beast at speed chess. He was super weird in the beginning but I tought hey he never learned to act normaly with people (bullying and stuff made it hard for him) so I just treat him normally and without predjudice. He finished his masters in psychology where I didnt finish anything and since he knew he wasnt super with people he went into market psychology. There he could nerd out his assignments and the company loves his work."

I learned that in trauma patients involving an accident etc there are guided therapy sessions where you deconstruct real things you could have done (eg. not place a gascan near a stove) and missplaced guilt (i should have ran into that burning house to safe that person). I honestly dont know if its the thing that help you but thats my 2 cents. Also they will tell you about the phases of grief and it changes from x to y to z or random order but the truth is that grief is very individual and there is no time you should be at stage xyz. Its more so people find themselfes again in some form of structure after their life collapsed. Help your family and you help yourselfes.

Suicide is mostly followed by feelings of (missplaced) guilt by the family or friends of the victim. Most people dont leave letters so that doesnt make shit better.

For here there were million of ""ifs"" and ""buts"" and all what she should have done and said and she... and now you cant tell to your sibling anything anymore.

The older you get the more freedom you get but well that doesnt help you know, still its something to look forward. In the moment you got some options:

You could go for a therapist if its covered by your health insurance. This leads to a touchy subject tho; you know yourselfe how desperate you are and I think you deserve professional help based on a honest level, but from personal experience I can tell you that closed ward and parents finding out isnt as big a fiesta as it sounds. If it keeps you in this world and helps you get better I can only recommend it.

Another option would be to move out into a youth home. At the time it didnt seem like the best options because while my parents fought their war I could do largely what I wanted, at least till I became the focus of the fire again. In retrospect I should have moved out as soon as I could (14-15 in my case) to get rid of the situation asap.

For the whole older men stuff... I dont know but if someone asks you to get into a van you better start running and screaming. Honestly I hope you find friends that go through the same stuff as you do now what often means that they are around your age. Maybe they could help you fuck up that kid that got to touchy feely with you? I dont know but pls be safe is the bottom line. You deserve to be happy and dont have the urge to hurt yourselfe just to cope.
