Which is it? CICO isn't a thing? Or athletes can 'burn off' a bad diet because they expend so many calories?"
fatlogic,ff7bqim,t1_ff677ke,1579645768.0,It is. I remember seeing a post on here of someone saying that using the term 'flattering' is fatphobic because it implies that you look thinner and that in turn implies that thinner is better.

RedPillWomen,fel0hs7,t3_epnl3d,1579211431.0,"I’ve always been the same way. I’ve actually been on the extreme end of the spectrum - I was so insecure and placed so much of my self worth on my looks that I would sometimes cry when I saw an attractive woman or refuse to leave my house because I felt so ugly. 

Fortunately I can say that that has faded as I’ve gotten older. Having a full time job, a home to care for, and a man to love has made me feel that as long as I stay up on my fitness and beauty routine and look *my* best I don’t have to necessarily be the hottest woman in the room all the time. It’s given me a lot more confidence. 

So I guess the only advice I can offer is find other things to place self worth on and continue your own growth."
fatlogic,feep6k2,t1_feelm8o,1579038309.0,"The ""guess how many calories this is"" game is really eye opening. I'm currently working on that with my boyfriend. He says things like ""that's healthy so the calories in that don't count"" (about avocados) or will severely underestimate the number of calories in dishes. I'm talking underestimating by hundreds of calories. I think he's starting to see the light though."
AmItheAsshole,fe1tgc3,t3_endax5,1578830708.0,"Yeah... NTA. All the important stuff has been identified already, but I’m thinking back to a massage I got a week ago, my first one ever. The masseuse was a man. I told my SO this and it made no difference to him, because he trusts me. Obviously I can’t make a judgment call just from the info provided here, but...I would say it’s a red flag."
books,fe1onp8,t3_enk0wf,1578829131.0,"This is so beautiful to read OP, because it seems to me that that was exactly Camus’ intention. The first part of the book was supposed to make you feel helpless and lost, which leads you into a feeling of release in the scene where he’s in jail, gazing at the stars and truly feeling the cold, unfeeling weight of the universe. That your intentions don’t really matter - in the end, we are alone. 

You seemed to have truly understood and related to the text. That’s excellent."

notlikeothergirls,fcosktb,t3_ei21zn,1577840410.0,ULTIMATE r/tiktokcringe I mean wow. I cringed so hard I almost just turned inside out. She is very much a conventionally attractive person.
RedPillWomen,fcc11bh,t3_eh0ghd,1577593203.0,"I used to be awkward too. What I did was I spent a couple of years quietly observing charming people. That includes real life people and people on tv, in movies and in books. I took note of charming, smooth small talk and behavior and tried to emulate that in my conversations with men. 

There’s actually an entire YouTube channel dedicated to this kind of thing - Charisma on Demand. Check it out, maybe it’ll help. In any case, you probably will have to spend a year or two laying low and learning before putting it into action.

Best of luck!!"
fatlogic,fbeyfby,t3_ecn75k,1576796952.0,This is kind of unrelated but I just really can't stand the 'folx' thing. It makes me cringe so hard every time I read it.
