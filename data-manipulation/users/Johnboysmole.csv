LoveIslandTV,ffgsrtp,t3_etj5yz,1579914125.0,I actually agree. Luke T has chaos energy. Connagh had minimal energy.
LoveIslandTV,ffgke2w,t3_ethq7i,1579908252.0,"He's nice, has a cheerful personality, but mainly I think it's his reaction to things.

He doesn't take things personally, he's philosophical about the roller coaster. He was clearly a bit sad tonight at the prospect of going, but was mature about it. 

He doesn't lash out or get pissy or passive aggressive. He's low key emotionally mature."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fffplbz,t1_ffflnsp,1579889037.0,"The scarf, sweet baby jesus that scarf.

Actually no, just realised that henna is old which means the chick was walking around with it, which makes me cringe so hard. We all know she didn't get it at no Indian wedding. Her best friend Michelle did it for her over a few glasses of Pinot Greej."
LoveIslandTV,fffk8oc,t3_etcauz,1579885765.0,"But they definitely had to say their height preference when applying.

I, for example, always preferred guys who are about my own height - 5'7""/5'8"". I don't like someone literally looming over me. It bugs me. I married a guy who is 5'7"" on a good day. 

I may not be in the majority, but surely some girls who are like me applied?

I'd be fairly unimpressed if every women they put in there ticked ""tall as a fucking tree"" when they were simultaneously putting a 5'7"" guy in there. That seems like a big fuck up."
CasualConversation,fffjlx8,t3_etbv3f,1579885368.0,"The only thing that works for me is counting backwards from 1000. That's a good one, that usually works no matter if I've been looking at my phone or not.

However there are things that are a no brainer. No caffeine in the evenings, don't drink an hour before bed or your bladder will wake you up, and a heavy quilt."
CasualConversation,fffj9vs,t1_fffb2hc,1579885161.0,"I have both a kindle and paper books. The kindle will keep me reading for half a book. The paper books will have my eyes getting heavy after like 5 pages. I dunno if it's witchcraft or what, but the difference is significant."
books,fffipsn,t3_etcql6,1579884822.0,Fuck I'm not gonna judge. They're steamy as fuck and at least pretend to have a story.
TheHandmaidsTale,fff3l0s,t1_fff35fl,1579874780.0,"Yeah it's pretty much emphasised that marriage = not just love, but sexual love."
TheHandmaidsTale,ffethzn,t1_ffemb3i,1579864789.0,But do fundamentalists follow Paul's letters? I was raised Catholic and Pauls letters are  basically as important (some might argue more) than the Bible itself. But I suspect he's inconvenient for many Bible thumpers and easy to ignore.
AskReddit,ffet8s6,t3_et8dp2,1579864444.0,"I have a lot of friends living in the UK. Most are really struggling with big decisions about their future right now, let's put it that way."

CasualConversation,ffesoee,t3_et8bhi,1579863660.0,"Just ask them how they're doing, what they're working at, what course are they doing.

Always ask about siblings you may have known.

Don't pepper them with questions, allow a conversation to develop from their answers. But you don't necessarily have to talk about yourself that much if you don't want to.

And if all else fails, mention Netflix and ask what they're watching right now. Everyone watches TV."
TheHandmaidsTale,ffelyd3,t3_et6v06,1579853732.0,"Rather than a hard and fast rule, I imagine that Commanders just stop seeing their Wives in a sexual way.

They have all become a bit brainwashed, that sex is for reproduction, and any sex outside that is dirty. So: Jezebels.

Add to that that their Wives have essentially all turned into completely different Phyllis Schafely pod people, and you can see how they become untouchable real fast.

The sort of guy who actually wants a Stepford Wife has a Handmaid to fulfil his needs for submissive sex. He doesn't need to actually touch his Wife anymore."
LoveIslandTV,ffelee4,t3_et2f3h,1579852994.0,"In fairness, unless there was a disciplinary, then it's just an unfounded rumour.

So I'd disregard this if there's no verification anyone even complained at all."
LoveIslandTV,ffel3im,t3_et0xa6,1579852601.0,I actually really respect that he's reading people correctly and isn't trying to a) pester them into feeling pressurised to pick him or b) sulk about it.
todayilearned,ffd3cce,t1_ffcy83f,1579812606.0,"Hasselhof released Looking for Freedom in Germany in June 89. Massive massive hit, as captures the simmering mood. Everyone singing it all summer. Wall finally comes down in November, Hasselhof is invited to sing Looking for Freedom on live TV on New Year's Eve and he insists on performing it atop the remains of the Wall to a huge crowd of reunited Germans. The place goes nuts. 

Bowie had spent a lot of time in Berlin for years but he'll never ever be associated with the fall of the Wall like the Hoff."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffbnx2u,t3_esm9te,1579774883.0,Apparently white guys don't even have to be pretty to be models these days.
LoveIslandTV,ffbmjii,t3_eso9lu,1579772778.0,"The high five was brutal. I mean she may as well have hoisted aloft a placard saying ""I have zero interest in you but I'll bide my time"". But not even a hug, Leanne??! 

On the other hand it's good she was so honest cos Mike had no idea she was so aloof about him and now at least he can weigh up his options.

Personally I think he needs to jump ship. If someone is high fiving you after 2 weeks of sharing a bed, it really ain't going anywhere."
LoveIslandTV,ffbmeoq,t3_esptj2,1579772571.0,"He's 5'7"" FFS, he's hardly Warwick Davis. The girls in there are ridiculous."
television,ffbjjis,t1_ffbfypf,1579768291.0,Yeah he's been pretty vocal about it. And how Joe gets away with everything because of his white privilege.
television,ffaifxj,t3_esju16,1579736492.0,"I know some people are absolutely flat out in love with crazy 'ol Joe. Madness.

But I do think he's definitely one of the most complex and fascinating characters on TV right now, and Season 2 added to the layers of his personality a lot. 

And it's definitely plausible how women fall in love with him in the show, which helps with the suspension of disbelief."
AskReddit,ffahv0c,t3_esjxi3,1579736097.0,"If she doesn't like diamonds for ethical reasons, then moisannite is becoming super popular as its indistinguishable. And cheaper than diamonds.

But if she just doesn't like white stones, then sapphires are pretty popular these days. Emerald and rubies are still pretty tough to make look modern for some reason, but you can get some pretty modern sapphire rings.

Tanzanite is like a sapphire but a more purpley-blue. Absolutely gorgeous colour. Don't sleep on Tanzanite."
AskReddit,ffahgz6,t3_esjt9g,1579735838.0,"It's like that scene in Waiting to Exhale where the guy comes in like 10 seconds and is all triumphant and smug and she's laying there beside him thinking ""does he actually think something happened here??! """
TheHandmaidsTale,ff8iuts,t1_ff8aip2,1579680496.0,"I agree, the timeline indicates that Offred1 was actually Offred2, and June was Offred3.

June is OfJoseph4. (Even then there's time missing if you add it up which indicates the Lawrence's resisted Handmaid's at the beginning as long as they could) 

Since Fred presumably started getting Handmaid's from Gileads creation, and Offred1 hadn't the full 2 years done before killing herself, it means there's some time missing. June was probably at the 2 year mark by the time Nicole was born, but that's only 3/3.5 years. There has to have been one before."
CasualConversation,ff8h4jb,t3_es8cmx,1579678244.0,"I mean these are guys who are still considered in their prime these days (Brad Pitt is 56 for example). A lot of guys in their 40s and 50s still look pretty good. So I think it's pretty normal. 

It's not like they're all old Victorians wearing handlebar moustaches!"
CasualConversation,ff704jh,t3_erzc0j,1579638453.0,"7 weeks is emotionally rough, man. You're just petrified you're gonna miscarry, you're more exhausted than you've ever been, and you're just a goddamn mess.

Buy a book and start reading. My husband got one called Pregnancy for Men that was pretty hilarious, though British. Helped him a lot."

television,ff6pmmo,t3_eryclv,1579632244.0,"I started watching from Season 1 just last week. All the 1970s stuff.  All the stuff about ""Here Comes The Judge""? That was mad interesting. And Grandmaster Flash is a really fascinating personality. 

I can see myself burning through it. Sends you down a Wikipedia wormhole about 5 times an episode."
mildlyinteresting,ff3t7mj,t3_ergyzp,1579548333.0,I follow a woman with achondraplasia on IG and its really opened my eyes to sink heights. Most of the time there's literally no way for her to wash her hands after she pees. It's not like there's ever stools in public toilets.

MNTrolls,ff34gag,t3_erdngu,1579533429.0,"It actually is more common than you think. But you wouldnt necessarily know that unless you worked in the healthcare area. Every hospital has at least one case of sepsis at any given time, and truthfully probably 2 or 3.

That doesn't mean it's not all bullshit though."
television,ff2ljvk,t3_erarhl,1579511855.0,"I actually didn't really like the series at all. I am very ambivalent about watching a 2nd series.

But I still think Cavill was the best thing about it. Tbh often he was the only reason I watched.

Yeah Geralt was monotone but I really don't think he wasn't nuanced. I thought he did show quite a bit of unexpected emotion in scenes with Yennifer. And when he lashed out that that deeply annoying Bard. I do think the character deepened as the series went on and showed some evolution."
