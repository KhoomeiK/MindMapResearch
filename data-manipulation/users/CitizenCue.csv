politics,ff812yy,t1_ff7z1xz,1579663226.0,"1) Having worked for many politicians at all levels, I can assure you that very few (on either side) act in exclusively self-interested ways.  They are not some other devious breed of human - they have as many motivations to do things as the rest of us do.  For the most part, the reasons they do things are precisely the reasons they say they're doing things, just like the rest of us.  Doing things for secret reasons in a coordinated fashion over long periods of time would require a level of sophistication, discipline, and competence that only a genius could successfully pull off.  All humans act selfishly SOME of the time, but politicians are neither more selfish nor selfless than the population at large.  

2) The vast majority of Democratic politicians support policies (like progressive taxation itself) which disproportionately takes money from themselves to help people less fortunate than them.  The minimum wage, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, the EITC, and the expansion of these and all other welfare policies are funded primarily through progressive taxes.  Democrats universally support these programs and are working to expand them and others.  The current proposed plans to pay for these expansions universally draw disproportionately from wealthy people.  

Again, wealthy people do support programs which benefit themselves SOMETIMES, just like all of us do or would.  But the liberal rich very frequently do the opposite as well."

Market makers work for companies which create liquidity in options markets by both buying and selling tons of options, while earning money off the difference between the bid & ask prices (""arbitrage"").  If you think of options as used cars, then market makers are sort of like used car dealerships who buy cars for one price and resell them for a higher price.

If you're wondering how the *market makers* choose the bid/ask prices they offer, then that's a more complicated question which definitely involves computer models (see /u/y7nx90 's response here for example).

If you do mention it to your wife, do it *casually*, and do not make it ""about the market"" because that reasoning is false and sounds disingenuous (it is motivated reasoning at best).  It's fine to make sure she knows that an early gift won't trigger the gift tax, but it's entirely up to her if she wants to ask him."
fatFIRE,fe6at6q,t1_fe5xz9m,1578885704.0,"Excellent point.  For most people of means, wealth is almost entirely abstract.  They will never touch 80% of their money but they just like that it's ""there"".  

If instead of bank accounts, people stored giant piles of food, we'd call them monsters for hoarding it from hungry people.  But we don't see money the same way because our brains are bad at things."

AmItheAsshole,fdosqsh,t3_emetl5,1578612040.0,"NAH - You're not an asshole, you're just young and understandably raw from your breakup.  You haven't ""disowned"" your mom, you're just disappointed in her and seeing her as a fallible human perhaps for the first time.  That's normal, and it sounds like there's enough love to weather this storm eventually.  

Your parents didn't ""lie to you""; they don't have any obligation to tell you about every mistake they've ever made.  Just like you don't have to tell them about your screw-ups.  You'll get through this, and if you take time to really understand your mom, you'll be better for it."

fatFIRE,fdgcrza,t3_el1z2n,1578390497.0,"Absolutely.  We only own a car for trips out of town.  Probably use it once a week or less and take uber or public transportation everywhere else.  

A big reason for me is to avoid ever drinking and driving.  The amount of tipsy-driving I see in places where everyone drives everywhere is terrifying."

Yes, gold jewelry is common in the US, but it is much less common than it was in part generations, and it is not considered an ""investment"".  It is very easy to lose physical assets to theft, fire, or simply misplacing them.  So in a modern economy, it is much safer to put money into the stock market or a savings account.  You can even buy gold ""stock"" (like the gold ETF ""GLD"") which works just like owning gold but instead of storing it yourself, you own a piece of a large amount of gold stored elsewhere (in this case, a vault in London).  You therefore get all the value of owning gold, without the risk of buying, storing, and selling it yourself."
