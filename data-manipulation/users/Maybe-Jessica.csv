One thing that came to mind as you said condom availability: a lot of people in Germany pay church taxes. Don't know if that's a thing elsewhere, but the general perception is that a lot of it goes to charities and poor people. One thing they explicitly don't do is distribute condoms, the pope says no.

So the takeaway is to select some charity that does what you want rather than trusting public perception."

I agree we should stop the population growth in Africa, so let's lift Africa out of poverty! 90% of the one year olds worldwide already receive some vaccinations, we are totally getting there. It just needs one last push to get the remaining 1 (out of 8) billion people out of poverty."

What I do is wait a few days before updating, usually any bad bugs are found within hours and a hotfix pushed a few hours later (or at most a day, if it was relatively minor).

It's what Debian also does: stable is ancient software (well, a year or two old at most) with security updates, the ""unstable"" branch is yolo, and for those who want the new stuff without the breakage there is ""testing"" (basically, if it has been in unstable for a week, it moves to testing), so that's the OS I use."
factorio,fdffb0n,t1_fdfd7h0,1578360353.0,"To be honest, every time I see someone mentioning 32 bits I wonder what kind of system they're talking about. I think my last 32 bit system ran Windows XP (note that W7 came out more than a decade ago). On Windows there seems to be more legacy software, but given that Windows 7 can run Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 that was made for Windows 95 (maybe even a 16 bit system, not sure) and was written in Assembly of all languages, backwards compatibility doesn't appear be a reason not to have a 64 bit OS. On Linux, all software from the repositories has been 64 bit for as long as I've been using Linux.

I'm really not sure what kind of esoteric and underpowered systems would be 32 bits in ~~2019~~ 2020.

Additionally, I think it would be hard to tell who really wanted a refund because of their ancient system that can barely run anything larger than a starter's base anyway (if that) and who just wanted a free copy.

Given that and the large overhead per person, I can see why they didn't bother. But I do agree that, if 32 bit support was a selling point, they should legally offer refunds even if no sane person would decide to buy a game based on that."
