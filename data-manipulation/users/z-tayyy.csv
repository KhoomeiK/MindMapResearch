Do you know anything about these legal proceedings at all? “From a legal standpoint” makes it seem like you have experience on the subject, which I highly doubt. Plus if your main argument is their case is weak while they’re being stonewalled at every corner in an *obstruction* case, you’re just not getting it. If you cannot objectively look at this situation and see wrong doing, it’s out of pure ignorance."

Trump has already been impeached and will always reflect that. These ignorant apathetic comments just prove that half the country wants to bitch and never take any steps to fix anything."
