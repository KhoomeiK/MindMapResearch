Not like me, planning plus procrastinating."
dialysis,femxdxc,t3_enn0fs,1579272086.0,"Depends. Am on dialysis 3 years and haven't stopped yet, in fact, looking at a hysterectomy because I have fibroids.

Did stop for a year + while on steroids. But started back up."

AskReddit,felyuqs,t1_felpi6h,1579234472.0,They are using jackfruit at the wrong stage then. Green jackfruit is not the least bit sweet. But cleaning them isa major chore. Lots of inedible parts and the latex is horrible. But the tender ones make s lovely curry.

dialysis,fe05540,t1_fdxwy0g,1578803315.0,"Re Nephrologist being odd, I had one doctor who was really great, young guy with not too many patients who worked with me to resolve my issues. Unfortunately I moved away. All the others and there have been quite a few since I travel a bit for work once in a while, were similar"
dialysis,fe04w68,t1_fdxwy0g,1578803147.0,"Medicine works a little different in my country, so we don't really have too many registered nurses, especially in neph where the technicians handle it. And I don't really have a gp, we are free to walk in to any specialist as needed, thankfully I haven't needed general medicine in a while. Also, gps usually get scared when they hear my litany of issues and will tell me to check with my nephrologist. Don't have someone long term who understands my issues. Am much better today as the pain usually only lasts 12 hours or so. But I will check on options once I go next time."
dialysis,fdxwqi6,t1_fdwoizz,1578773714.0,"Hmm. I did take mircera for a couple of years until it stopped working. Now am on epo alpha. But I got the same reaction for both, and I have taken several brands of epo alpha. Well, will talk to the doctor once more."
dialysis,fdxw9lt,t1_fdxnpa7,1578773533.0,"Lol at the still alive appointment. That's exactly what they feel like. And yeah I get so tired of the nephrologist going hmm, making a sympathetic face and doing nothing."
dialysis,fdwa63k,t1_fdw5gb0,1578756635.0,I have. They didn't have much to say. Internet side effects of epo does include pain and feverishness and I have always had this.
fatlogic,fdplwzi,t1_fdoxuoy,1578632322.0,"Totally depends on the tests done. I took a Heath quiz with my work insurance, and they asked numbers for a number of tests. The recommendation at the end was to eat less salt because I have high blood pressure. Otherwise I was healthy. 

In reality I have kidney failure. But they didn't have those numbers on the test."

AskReddit,fck437u,t1_fcj8edc,1577715997.0,"This is so weird for us - any out of town weddings guest expenses are always paid for by the family - whether housing them at a hotel or someone's home, food, local travel etc. The only thing guests might be paying for would be their travel costs. This expectation for guests to pay for themselves to meet the couple's whims is very odd. This includes clothes - if there is a dress code (as in particular colors and styles), you pay for it."

AskReddit,fbu4a8z,t1_fbt7irp,1577107395.0,">She wasn't a kind person. She cut off contact with all of her family members including her parents and distant relative. Co-workers said she is kinder to animals than other humans.

Doesn't necessarily mean that, don't judge her too harshly. People cut off family and generally trust other humans less when they have history."
