insanepeoplefacebook,ffg0yg2,t1_fff0den,1579896088.0,"I really don't even know where to begin with this historical ignorance, I really don't.  Republican support for civil rights was lukewarm at best.  Southern Democrats and Northern Democrats had distinctly different positions on Civil Rights.  This has been explained again and again, but you continue reiterating the same ignorance.  Just because you feel very strongly that the Republicans were stronger champions of civil rights than Democrats does not make it true, no?  The actual, substantive progress on rights that came in the 60s was pushed through by a Democratic president, and passed by a Democratic Congress, at great political cost.  Others in this thread have done a great job of outlining the historical record; I refer you to them and their sources. Personally, I would take LBJ's substantive, decisive actions over the Republican party's milquetoast lip service any day of the week.  Judging by black support for Democrats then and after, I'd say they agree.

The notion that Trump has done nothing substative to harm Muslims or immigrants is so laughable that it scarcely merits a response.  If you wish to be taken seriously, try not to be such a fatuous ignoramus.  God grant me the unearned confidence of someone like you.  Paging messers Dunning and Kruger...

I won't ask if I've explained it well enough for you, since no amount of explanation will convince someone who erroneously thinks he knows it all already."
SuicideWatch,ffdalat,t1_ffd4dsp,1579816717.0,"I appreciate your comment.  It's not that good things have never happened, it's that they have simply not been enough.  We don't live in a world that rewards good deeds.  Rather, we live in one where the competent and efficient get rewarded, even if their competence and efficiency is in doing horrible things.  I have had good intentions, but those have come to nought.  It's rather like Alec Baldwin's speech in Glengarry/Glenross.  In the final analysis, it doesn't matter how nice a person you are if you don't close the deal.  This is especially true of men, who have no intrinsic worth outside of what they earn or achieve.  I would never judge anyone else's choices, but I know that, for me, a life of taking up space, of failure, of consuming resources without giving back, is not something I want.  Pretty much anything I've done in life could have been done better by someone else.  In occupying my place in life, I am denying a place to someone who is infinitely more deserving and competent.  In particular, my wife and my kids deserve someone better, someone who can actually provide for them in the way a man should.  With me out of the way, this could finally happen."

insanepeoplefacebook,ffcd0fy,t1_ffc6aob,1579796803.0,"Your arguments are very very weak, and betray only a superficial knowledge of King and his thinking on social justice.  Most of this is supposition based on very flimsy evidence.  The only conclusion you are able to definitively make us that he *could* have allied himself with Republicans.  If course, we know that King was a political pragmatist who was willing to work with whomever would support Civil Rights.  As such, he worked very closely with LBJ around the passage of the CRA.  Of course, he welcomed Republican support, just as he welcomed any support.  He also staunchly opposed involvement in Vietnam and was a supporter of labor unions (he was assassinated in Memphis, where he had gone to support a garbage collector's strike).  

Keep in mind that MLK was a man of the 50s and 60s, so he would naturally have the views of a 50s and 60s man on homosexuality and abortion.  To extrapolate that he would support the modern Republican party based solely on these very flimsy  reeds, ignoring his substantial writings and activism on behalf of poor people and social justice is, well... let's just say, don't hurt yourself with so much reaching.  I highly doubt King would have supported Trump's hateful actions against Muslims and immigrants generally.  I doubt King would have supported family separation.  I doubt he would have approved of Stephen Miller.

I would also like to point out that the strongest indicator of whether a Congressperson opposed or supported the CRA wasn't  party affiliation, but rather regionalism.  Southerners overwhelmingly opposed the CRA, and that includes the handful of Southern Republicans at the time.  Northerers, Democrats and Republicans, tended to support it.  After the CRA was passed, the South began its slow movement away from the Democratic Party, as the party became increasingly associated with black civil rights.  Some Dixiecrats, like Strom Thurmond, switched parties immediately.  Others, like John Stennis of Mississippi, remained Democrats in name, but rarely supported the party agenda.  Still others, like Robert Byrd and even George Wallace, moved away from racism and embraced civil rights.  Southern voters typically elected Republicans when their Dixiecrat representative or senator retired or died, leaving us where we are today.  Meamwhile, the Republicans increasingly courted the votes of racist white Southerners, using such dog whistle terms as ""tough on crime"" and ""quotas"" to telegraph their beliefs."

Making individual, specific predictions is difficult, and most scientists hedge their predictions with uncertainty.  Unfortunately,  certain people expect that these predictions will be the gospel truth down to the last detail.  Inaccurately predicting when oil will run out does not therefore mean that oil is unlimited.  Inaccurately predicting when the ice caps will disappear does not therefore mean that the ice caps aren't melting.

Is that really the hill you want to die on?  Because the totality of chattel slavery as practiced by Europeans in the Americas, when you take into account the length and severity of it, ranks with some of the worst atrocities committed by one group of humans against another.  The death toll of the Middle Passage by itself would rank as a major atrocity (death toll of 1-2 million people), let alone what they experienced on the other side.
