relationship_advice,fdd4uf5,t1_fdd4lqe,1578294856.0,"Honestly you guys need to sit down and just hash it out and talk out what your thinking, more so what's on her mind and whats bugging her cause this (without knowing full details) shouldn't be an end of relationship scenario. This is more of a strong conversation about expectations and right time and place kinda deal. If you guys have been saying I love you and things then you need to communicate for common goals.

And at the end of the day if things dont work out trust me it's not the end, it's a long road but dont get bogged down by these type of issues people come and go from your life talk out what you can and appreciate what you can.

Best of luck!"
