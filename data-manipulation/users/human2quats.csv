Anxiety,ffhadvk,t1_ffh132o,1579927816.0,"Oh it turned out okay.
What pissed me off is I was still only half way through the starter pack. 
Told the doctor and the prick made me take a drug test. I passed. I asked what now. And was told to stay on it and increase as Rx'd."

puns,ffgqdhr,t3_etewhf,1579912390.0,"Jokes aside this one is kinda creepy for me personally.  I had a friend who was a carney.
I had a pic of him looked just like this. Human though, of course. Poor guy. He was a quintessential carne too. Drank and smoked constantly to deal with pain in his past. Toughest (physically) guy I had ever met until then. He wanted me to go on a road trip with him. I turned him for work. He wrecked and died on that trip. A couple hours out of town. I still don't know if I had went with him if I could have saved him or he would have killed me"
Anxiety,ffgpl93,t3_eteuud,1579911833.0,"I just remembered. 
The dr tried thyroid suppressants saying mine was a little high. 
Took em for months. Felt tired but that was it. Didn't wind up fixing my shakey hands. 
It might be worth a shot. It's just a quick blood test."
Anxiety,ffgp37b,t1_ffg0c3g,1579911480.0,"Oh god I was on that a long time ago. That stuff needs to be banned. It messed me up bad for a long time. I kept getting my whole body locking  up all of the sudden. No warning. Like I would be driving and all of the sudden I just couldn't move. I'd be completely alert, I'd know I would have to move my hands to steer, but I couldn't for several seconds at a time."
