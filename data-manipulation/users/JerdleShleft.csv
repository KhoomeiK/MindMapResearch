cats,ffedwze,t1_ffeajug,1579844431.0,"Oddly enough, she's on a well balanced diet and a lot of that isn't ""chunk"" per se. She's skinnier, and has this weird pouch near her stomach that kinda hangs. We found her outside years ago, and my FIL said it could be a survival type thing to store fat there to protect their stomach? No idea how much truth that holds. Nonetheless, thank you for your concern, and rest assured Nemo gets plenty of exercise and love as well!
Edit: wife said it's called a premordial pouch"

Anxiety,fcqny1e,t3_eid44l,1577889317.0,"I do what's called ""ruminating"", my wife has told me. I haven't sought treatment yet, although I am in the process. My wife has severe CPTSD, anxiety, and has been helping me through what I believe are really bad panic attacks. I'm just constantly thinking about death and other existential crises, to the point where I can't think about anything else. And I can't help it at all, last night it got to the point where I couldn't control my breathing and I was very scared. Luckily I have an amazing wife and she helps me through every moment. Not sure if this helped at all, but it helped me. Lol.

Edit: grammar"
