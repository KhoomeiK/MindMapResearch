Keto_Food,ffbjikf,t1_ffbc1tv,1579768255.0,That most definitely is it.  I’m a fairly new to Reddit. My next post I’ll know what to do 😀
konmari,ffaz3tu,t3_eskpcz,1579747836.0,Don’t be ashamed! Be proud of all you have accomplished! I’ve been there (would still be if my fiancé wasn’t so good at cleaning!!)
Keto_Food,ffayy5d,t1_ffap92f,1579747730.0,I used one cup which has 6 net carbs & made 3 servings worth of scramble. So about 2 carbs worth per serving.  The shelled kind I have - the entire bag is a serving (!) and 4 net carbs. That’s a movie snack I can handle!
Keto_Food,ffaafic,t1_ffa0xav,1579731038.0,Thank you! I have defnitely gotten some good ideas from this group - makes me more excited to keep going
Keto_Food,ffaabxa,t1_ffa92ac,1579730982.0,It kept limiting my character count - which is why I was abbreviating the words.  HWC is heavy whipping cream.  I am not sure if it was becuase I had a photo or because I was on my phone why it was limiting the amount of characters I could use :)
Keto_Food,ff9z68c,t1_ff9wxor,1579724634.0,😂🤣😂
Keto_Food,ff9wan8,t1_ff9tth7,1579722908.0,"Oh thank you!  I will look at that app. That is definitely what confuses me (and intimidates) me more about keto is the macros. I haven’t figured that part out -  so it feels like I’m just eating low carb.  Dinners have been more healthy best we can - but the kids are not doing keto either. I try now to buy healthier snacks for them - fruits & stuff. they can eat all the fruit they want - I figure it’s so much better than a bag of candy. Of course their dad the keto cop is like “fruit is the devil!!! So much sugar!!!”  Dude they are kids. They need carbs - chill out. 

And yesssssssssssssssss!!!! It’s so much more difficult with kids - so that is good to keep in mind. Plus - after a day of dealing with mine (my oldest has special needs & is diff-i-cult!) some days all i want to do is smoke some herb & eat snacks. (It’s my equivalent to a glass of wine :) ) Plus side of munchies is everything tastes so much better - even the healthy stuff!  Haha"
Keto_Food,ff9owrl,t1_ff9mbry,1579717600.0,"Whew. Good to know - because earlier today I was feeling all down & out because I haven’t been able
To make a big grocery run for the more expensive items.  And my ex-husband has lost over 100lbs in a year on Keto - and he is all keto police about everything - but makes over double my income (and I have our 3 kids 90% of the time).  Double eye roll 🤣"
cricut,ff9nn3f,t3_esdxsw,1579716777.0,Amazing in every way.
cricut,fdtefiw,t3_en19h1,1578715580.0,How did you do this?

whooooooa crazy stuff"
lgbt,fdtawe3,t3_emqdkb,1578714199.0,Reading her Wikipedia page - realizing I have done shit with my life.
keto,fdf6tms,t1_fdf5cvh,1578354641.0,I think being as this is more a of way of eating & not a crash diet - that helps for sure with your self esteem. When I first lost weight - it was because I was existing on saltines & peanut butter & in loooooooove with a boy. I’m older and wiser now. Life is too short to let people rule over you. And you are WORTH IT - chubby or not.  Don’t forget it. You do not owe anyone anything when it comes to intimacy - and anyone who makes you feel like you do - not worth it.  You got this :)  side note - I am all for sexual expression & everything & there is nothing wrong with doing what you want to do - I’m just saying we gotta do it for ourselves & not for others approval.  :)
keto,fdez8i0,t3_el0cvc,1578349758.0,When I was single & in my early 20s - I lost a bunch a weight & for the first time in my life was given attention by men. Which spiraled into unhealthy & dangerous & promiscuous activity because my brain was still telling me I was unattractive and needed to do whatever to get someone to like me. It’s sad. I have heard of many people who lose weight and end up with a different addiction - be it sex or alcohol or whatever.   Now I am older (and fatter 😂)and in a healthy relationship. So as I lose weight - which we are doing together - I’m excited to see how it brings us closer. And I know she loves me chubby or not.
