todayilearned,fdoftt8,t1_fdnsxdc,1578604283.0,"Prohibition seems silly now, but during the time drinking was rampant and wages would often be wasted at bars. The men were expected to earn while the women were the “taking care” of the household but it was impossible to do so with all the money going down the drain. With no social net and given the cultural context of the time it makes a lot of sense why women pushed so hard for prohibition.

E: some people are assuming that I think prohibition had a positive effect. I never said that, I am just providing context on why prohibition was so widely supported among women. It’s important to learn from the mistakes we made in history, especially the ones which at the time seem like obvious choices."
