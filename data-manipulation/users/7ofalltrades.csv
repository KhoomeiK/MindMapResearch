I think we're 7 point underdogs right now? Sounds about right to me, if I'm being honest. They have a much more proven track record. They absolutely handled the Texans last week, even worse if you cherry pick the last 3 quarters. I think if they gift us 24 points, though, you aren't going to see the same shit the Texans did. We can absolutely kill 3 quarters of football and give you very few opportunities to make a comeback.

One did end in a pick on a pass that should have never been thrown. It’s hard to call that a defensive stop, it’s a huge mistake between Tanne and Davis. So ultimately we’re talking one drive that was stopped because the Patriots kept us from getting a first down, one with an offensive mistake, and two where we were clearly just running every down no matter what to burn clock. So yeah, we didn’t score an offensive TD in the second half. I wouldn’t exactly say we were *held* to 0 offensive points. 

But I expect the Titans to come out with a completely different game plan this Saturday, because you’re absolutely right that type of game won’t win against you guys. We can burn clock against the Pats with a whopping 10 minutes left in the quarter only up by one because we have confidence in stopping their offense. That won’t work against you guys. We’ve gotta be ready and committed to getting points on every drive. We need play action, we need Henry to be a beast, and we need to have people getting open.

Tennesseetitans,fdetkjf,t1_fdesq3i,1578346314.0,"Yeah I feel like we realized all we had to do was keep giving it to Henry and then not have any huge mistakes. So we did. Nothing too terribly flashy, just get the W. 

However, we've got some absolute playmakers on offense to look out for. AJ Brown is having a massive rookie year, and his YAC is insane. Our TE Jonnu Smith is like another Derrick Henry but runs routes and catches the ball. So many of his catches end up in him trucking someone. We've got several other people worth throwing to, and if we need to we can easily go 5 wide and have 5 completely valid and dangerous options to throw to. And Tannehill has proven several times that he can throw incredibly accurate passes at almost any distance. 

Our defense is very shaky. We lost one of our best corners for the season in Malcolm Butler. Adoree Jackson was our other great CB and he was out for several weeks but came back for the last game. We've got a really good secondary that could punish LJ for any misthrows and can cover like a lead blanket. 

We are great at stopping RBs, but mobile QBs have punished us IMO because our guys lose discipline when someone starts scrambling. They lose their shit and over-pursue, then we get burned on a long pass.

Tennesseetitans,fdeq7mv,t1_fdemush,1578344325.0,"Eh people grasp on anything. The same people exist on both sides - people in here hanging on to the fact that you guys lost to the Browns and people on the Ravens side of things saying we barely beat the Patriots, who lost to the Dolphins. It's a mostly meaningless argument that really boils down to one thing: any given Sunday. Anyone can lose to anyone. 

Outside of that, I agree: death, taxes, and Lamar/Henry having big days. That being said, what are the other things that our teams have? 

Ravens defense has some great numbers, but how much of that is due to the fact that your team averages 200 rushing yards per game, and therefore dominates T.O.P. and keeps offenses off the field? Is that inflating the stats of an otherwise average defense? Can Tannehill and our receivers have the same monster games they've been having since week 6? If our entire offense is banging, it will come down to the first team to make a huge mistake. We've got the leading rusher *and* some of the best passing game the NFL has seen in decades since Tanne has taken over. We've averaged 30 points per game since week 6, second only to the Ravens at 33 (all season). We can score, too.

I see it going three ways:

* One team gets an early lead, and uses that lead to take away the other team's rushing game, exerts their will, and wins. 

* Neither team can stop the other, it turns into a shootout and the team with the fewest turnovers wins.

* Titans absolutely have no answer for Lamar, and he methodically destroys them."

But I'm not seeing the justification behind the shade being thrown at Tanny in this post. Since he's been our starter, he's had passing stats that haven't been seen in over 20 years. The Ravens have a good secondary. It's possible you guys lock him down. But don't look at Tanne's performance this past weekend and think that's what he can do. We weren't passing because we didn't need to. Whenever we needed to pass we had decent success outside of one interception. We had no intention of passing. Don't sleep on Tanne."

It seems to be good luck to make sure everyone gets some love. To take the Pats down in the post season in Gillette takes every single person being great. 

Art Smith and crew for identifying the Pats weakness and playing straight at it and never letting off. Great secondary and weak run D? Fuck it, Henry on every play for 75 yards and a TD. 

Vrabels getting tons of love for his calls, and I agree. Obviously the stacked penalties to eat clock, but I even like him going for 2 at the end there, although I had to think that one through with some buddies. We go up by 9, the game is 100% over. Otherwise we're up by 7 and the Pats still have to pull a miracle just to tie it. 

AJax comes back after how many weeks off, plays a great game on pass defense *and* knocks down the hail mary. I never really thought they'd pull that play off, but it was AJax that stopped it. 

Our banged up secondary did enough to stop their O. We will almost certainly need more out of them next week, but they got it done."

Similar story! We were watching with a bunch of folks, some Titans fans and a few Packers fans sprinkled in, but all at least secondary Titans fans and of course fuck the Pats. One of my fellow Titans fans made a comment like ""best player on our team, hall of famer Brett Kern!"" and one of the Packers fans chuckled and scoffed at it a bit. Not 10 seconds later Kern pins it at the .5 yard line and we Titans fans go nuts and start chanting MVP! You don't know how valuable a punter can be until you have Kern."
Tennesseetitans,fddue7o,t1_fdawwui,1578324219.0,"My guess is he was betting on the 4% chance of a blocked kick as opposed to the 0.8% chance of a punt return for a TD. They didn't need a TD, really, just to get in FG range, but with 25 seconds on the clock and no TOs the odds of them getting a punt return good enough and maybe one play to get in scoring range were probably lower than that 4% of a punt block. 

I think it was a smart call. Their chances were almost nil either way, and it was possible Kern kicks a touchback instead or kicks it short and they don't have to rely on a big return, but maybe two chances to pass and get in FG range.

Kern just fucked that up hard."
