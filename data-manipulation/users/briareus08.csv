Fitness,ffofgv2,t1_ffn2giv,1580077145.0,"I did things like this as well, or running known distances. I lived ~10k from work so just decided to run home every now and then. Helps to have a very real goal other than just an arbitrary distance or time.

Also, run somewhere interesting!"
blackdesertonline,ffl2elc,t3_eu4fsd,1580033533.0,"If you want good PvE, check out FFXIV. BDO PvE is just repetitive grinding. So unless you enjoy killing 10 mobs with 1-2 skills, moving to the next pack, and repeating for hours, you won’t enjoy BDO long term. 

It’s still fun, but I don’t use it as my main game."
AskReddit,ffkbi4u,t1_ffk9wt8,1580020063.0,"Same, that tells me that you won’t be a good manager unless you’re actively working on it, and would probably be more comfortable in a technical position."

worldnews,ffhhkct,t1_ffhbpze,1579935550.0,"Fair. Well said - people’s lives shouldn’t be political footballs, especially when given so selflessly."
UpliftingNews,ffhh1vd,t1_ffhfgrz,1579934908.0,"Do you think there’s a relatively high proportion of low-socioeconomic people on reddit vs the normal population?

Also I’d contend that the issue is that some portion of the population is not well-served by the health care system, and that is inherently a huge problem. Anecdotes from people who are healthy or affluent enough to get good care don’t really solve anything."
UpliftingNews,ffhgibg,t1_ffhey9r,1579934244.0,"Eh, personally I’m happy to take the hit on tax and insurance costs so that everyone can get good health care."

UpliftingNews,ffheb6c,t1_ffhe3ov,1579931739.0,"Might want to read some of the other comments in the thread, but since you want to be an asshole about it, I was specifically responding to OP’s position. Lot of other people seem to be in the same boat, but I guess it’s all cool because you’re doing well? Nice."
UpliftingNews,ffhe6in,t1_ffhd1zd,1579931599.0,"It just shocks me every time. It shocked me when I went there and spoke to colleagues as well, but it’s just taken for granted in every other first world country, just not America. 

I dunno, I don’t think I’ll ever get used to it, it just seems so counterintuitive. The whole point of the government is to make decisions that improve people’s lives, so they can contribute to a society more fully, maximise GDP etc. it’s like watching someone shoot their foot and say “Yeah, but see how healthy the rest of the body is?”"
UpliftingNews,ffhdhwy,t1_ffhblr5,1579930864.0,"That is an insane ongoing cost to have for medical issues. So sad to hear so many stories from people in crushing circumstances for what would be free, or very cheap in literally every other first world country.

Sorry to hear that... I don’t know what else to say."
