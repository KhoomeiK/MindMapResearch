sleep,fdzxe93,t1_fdzu9yy,1578798124.0,"Mack's also makes some silicone disks that work really well. They cover the opening of the ear, rather than the plug sticking in. For me, they are more comfortable than ear plugs. I also listen to podcasts to put me to sleep. I have the stretchy headband that's leopard print, also from Amazon. It's held up for about 6-8 months with nightly use. Sometimes, I'll put the headphones on over the earplugs. Then I have the volume up enough to hear. When I'm done listening to the book or podcast, I already have the plugs in."

Also, you are NOT part of the problem. You keep pain meds because you may need them."
sleep,fdgzi7i,t3_elcmod,1578412069.0,"I am no expert, but I think schedule is more important.  I don't think sleeping until 8:30 would be a good idea if you want to go to bed and sleep at 9:00pm . Personally, sleeping in that late would throw me off my schedule, and then I'd be tossing and turning for hours. And then the early wake up would be difficult.   Good luck!"

AmItheAsshole,fctm26t,t3_eipecd,1577948407.0,"Oh, totally NTA! I hate when that happens.  People with kids and loose dogs act the same. Too entitled to pay fucking attention. Most dogs don't want anyone screaming and running at them, especially guard type dogs. Your dog gave a warning too, which of course the toddler didn't notice. You did absolutely the right thing to stop kid in its tracks. That lady is lucky you were paying attention.  We who are holding the leashes of our dogs are responsible for our dogs, and also for the idiots who don't recognize that not every dog wants their attentions.  Good way to be proactive."
