Only other thing I've done is gone downstairs and snuck a pear cider bottle every few months bc cider kinda slaps. Anyway, my point is I wont ever be a druggie, I'm only wanting to do it for the chance of a positive effect, and I've researched alot, like ayahuasca and ego death, but I needed more insight from personal experience, so I'm gonna finish reading lol thanks again!"

Or, you could *have* depression. if it lasts for more than 2 weeks, seek out a doctor who can diagnose you. diagnosed depression is something not uncommon, so dont think its your fault. im diagnosed with severe depression and im doing well in school, im in a good socioeconomic position, and im in the position to have a good future when i get out of high school. yet i still want to die, i got a [long document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YQTaOtmaJswbUZSRETFn2VqmBh5vewVDte3X9GVQFZc/edit?usp=sharing) just me putting it all on paper. so if you are feeling like how you described for an extended amount of time, seek out a doctor, talk to friends and loved ones. it does help. in fact, it helps when you're depressed and dont have depression. its just good to talk to others about whats hurting you.

I hope you get better, you sound like you're really worried about this and im worried for you. you can dm me if you want to talk about anything, feel free."
depression,fe4ctbd,t3_enrs4c,1578857958.0,"YES when im talking to others or writing it down on a document i made a few days ago it feels like im blowing it out of proportion but when im not writing it down it feels like i was understating it. Ive been trying to get as many people to read this document i wrote so i could get as much advice and perspectives as possible every time i talk about it or mention it i feel like im being extremely annoying and make my friends uncomfortable. ive only had 1 friend legitmately talk to me about it but now its just become a one way conversation i think, making me feel even more guilty about something i *know is the right thing to do.* im starting to think, maybe i should be attention seeking, right? if we're struggling and hurting, why would we back away from others when seeking attention is literally the best way to get help? theres a reason why doctors say talking to others is the best thing you can do, i think that if we feel like we're being melodramatic, its to gain more attention to be able get more help. when we break our arm, our first reaction is to yell out in pain, isnt that attracting attention to yourself?

so with that, lemmie just seek some attention [right quick](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YQTaOtmaJswbUZSRETFn2VqmBh5vewVDte3X9GVQFZc/edit?usp=sharing), and if you're down, from one depresso to another, you can send me your stuff."
SuicideWatch,fe2qk0s,t1_fe2lujy,1578841777.0,"Currently, I have written a [9 page document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YQTaOtmaJswbUZSRETFn2VqmBh5vewVDte3X9GVQFZc/edit?usp=sharing) that like 4000 words just to get my emotions and mental state down on paper. I started it Thursday, and have been updating it since. My train of thought was, if i share this out to people i know and dont know, i would be able to get some actual responses, because if it try talking in person or in a call or something, it just wouldnt come out right. I'm the ""always happy and joking"" person, so if i were to talk about something like this, i would make it sound funny or whatever and it would defeat the purpose.

I mainly wrote it because im in a position similar to yours, where stuff is going great, but i just dont feel it. nothing bad happened that caused me to feel like shit, no traumatic experiences in my life, grades have gone from failing to slightly above average, not poor, parents treat me like a human instead of trash. I couldnt find a source besides myself.

might seem out of line, but you could write an unfiltered paper with literally every single thing that is bothering you, and when you think its done, share it. thats what im doing. We are different people with different ages and environments, but it might be worth a shot."

This is literally a thing that we as humans all experience, its just that some disorders make it harder to dismiss. the only people who act upon these thoughts are those who feel guilty of them, but why would you feel guilty of being a human?"
SuicideWatch,fe0vtbq,t3_enl1sn,1578819229.0,"to be perfectly honest, if you want people to recognise your pain, why not show them what you posted here? All the posts ive seen here today have been generally the same but this one stood out to me. it fucking cut me. and ive been feeling nothing recently. i bet it'll cut them too. i wrote a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YQTaOtmaJswbUZSRETFn2VqmBh5vewVDte3X9GVQFZc/edit?usp=sharing) that is 9 pages on why i want to die, and im preparing to send it to the clan in the game i play who put me at such a high standard, bc im the most accomplished out of all of them. (i hope this can be used as a connection because im just a mediocre student.) the entire document is extremely cynically analytical, so people won't go ""oh are you alright whats wrong is everything okay"", because fuck that, and they'll be forced to take it seriously instead of what you described. i find that words on a paper get a point across better if it the intention is negative. i had to write it down because when im talking, i literally cannot force myself to be serious. im the ""always happy and joking"" person, so the only way i cant sound like ""not a big deal"" was to write it down. my idea is for you to print this post out, and put it anywhere someone would see, assuming your goal is for your suffering be recognized as a serious topic that needs to be adressed without unneeded emotion, like you said, calm and rational. you dont have to listen to me, im just a GT student turned video game addict, but i believe written words get a serious message across better."

SuicideWatch,fe0skkd,t3_enkgaa,1578818185.0,"this was merely a sentance in a like 9 page doc [right here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YQTaOtmaJswbUZSRETFn2VqmBh5vewVDte3X9GVQFZc/edit?usp=sharing) i wrote over the past few days documenting and analyzing my current position, but its probably one of the most important parts. it was in a paragraph talking about the lack of emotions i feel causes a lack of empathy toward other people especially my family. a family member of mine had surgury, but i didnt care. not a single bit. but the one thing that is burning into my chest is how world-shattering my death would be to people who care about me. We have a huge difference in how any people we know care about us, but I assure you that the effect will be the same on those people. I just cant do it if its going to have such a life-shattering effect on those who loved me. and trust me, it will. years ago, it broke my heart when i heard that someone at my neices school hung himself. I had no idea who this person was, what he looked like, what his personality was, but it still felt like a shiv twisting in my gut. I remembered this kid for *years.* I remember what i had for dinner when i heard it. where i was sitting at the table. who near me. this feeling is when i knew, no matter what happens, if i take my own life, all i will leave behind is heartbreak. to those who knew me or not. This is one of the core reasons why i cant do it. they wont forget. i have yet to forget a kid i never knew."
SuicideWatch,fe0ox2c,t1_fe0ktku,1578816908.0," thats why instead of writing emotionally, i documented and analyzed everything, everything I felt, related to, experienced, deal with, and tried to give a reason as to why. since ive fallen from ""meh i kinda wanna die but im doin kinda fine"" to ""god take me now"" with no trigger or change to cause it, ive become extremely analytical, and my friends have taken notice. idk if it will help me recover or is just my brain going ""haha die retard"", but we'll have to see in the coming weeks."
SuicideWatch,fe0kgpw,t3_enklw6,1578814976.0,"I feel you. I wrote a long fuckin document on everything that was happening with me and the first section was the main emotions i feel with severe depression, the biggest one being what i call ""empty depression."" just the lack of emotion, willpower, motivation, empathy, and sympathy. IDK if you want to look into it more, i have the doc as a tinyurl in this throwaway accounts description."
SuicideWatch,fe0h2kl,t3_enk7dk,1578813331.0,"what your friend said is flat out wrong. we help people with so many fatal diseases which one could easily point out natural selecton toward, yet we help them survive and live on. why would suicidal thoughts be any different? just because your friends said it doesnt mean its true. people with suicidal thoughts are basically no different than those without. It could be due to past experiences, current situations, or just something you literally couldnt do anything about. All of those things take place during ones life, which affect a range of so many people who are different with different ideologies, personalities, and different environments. Natural selection is solely locked to how you were formed when you were being born, and it would affect you throughout your life as a whole. If someone loses a job due to a failure in the economy, becomes depressed, and kills themselves, none of that was due to their DNA or their genes, so why was that person not meant to live?

&#x200B;

Your friend saying that is like saying an animal breaking their leg from a rockslide is natural selection. which is frankly untrue."
