To keep the bird safe, clipping its wings may be the only thing to do if there's not a cage.  The feathers grow back.  The crucial thing is to get that chain off!

Please take the bird to the vet if only to check it for a microchip.  Birds are like human toddlers  - imagine the anguish a 4-year-old human child would have if it lost its parents. That is what this bird is likely feeling.  

It's a wonderful thing you are doing to try to help this bird, but parrots are absolutely not like dogs or cats.  If you don't know what you're doing, especially with this species, you can easily harm it, mentally and physically.  This bird could end up being miserable, hurting you and, possibly, itself. 

Please Google African Grey rescue.  They will have a huge amount of help for you."
