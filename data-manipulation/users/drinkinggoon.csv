CleaningTips,felcf9d,t3_epkbj4,1579218900.0,Get a bristled scrubber and use something like- I think it’s called soft scrub? It’s a bleaching scrub and I use it on all sorts of things at work.
CleaningTips,feegkxw,t1_feegh88,1579033324.0,Thanks! We do have a huge tub for bathing dogs so I might be able to do that.
fatlogic,fdsfkb5,t1_fdscgp5,1578701621.0,"Haven’t met a single person that made this much fuss over diets that understood what starving really was. there’s too many unprivileged families in the world that actually do know what starving is like, meanwhile there’s enough people to start a *movement* because it’s “torture” to ever feel even slightly hungry. If some of them had any grasp of real starvation or exclusion from society id hope they would be more concerned with providing food for the homeless and elderly who can’t provide for themselves and have no one else to care for them instead of trying to demonize self improvement and discipline.  Sorry for rambling. Haven’t slept in like 30-ish hours. Probably won’t sleep for another like 5."
fatlogic,fdqs9x3,t3_emqf8o,1578673792.0,Hate to break it to you but just because you felt hungry at some point during the day that doesn’t mean you’re starving yourself.
fatlogic,fdput5j,t3_em9saj,1578641369.0,"If your body “wants” to continually increase its chances of dying before the age of 40 from something preventable maybe don’t let your body be in charge of your decisions, yeah?"
fatlogic,fdpuaej,t3_emmake,1578640753.0,"How much of a numbskull do you have to be to think that making drastic changes for a quick result and making sustainable lifestyle changes for a lasting result are the same thing.

Of course you’re not gonna maintain your goal weight if you got there by doing something you’re not willing to do for the rest of your life. You don’t need to get a degree in rocket science to understand that."
fatlogic,fdpq18v,t3_embfp2,1578636195.0,"Lol if waving your arms around, swaying your hips, and whipping your head back and forth is considered a high energy performance then I’m basically an Olympian for running a ten minute mile on the regular and lifting weights religiously compared to Lizzo and what this person thinks is “most people”.  and my ass is clinically obese too. 

Spend a week in the gym and you might realize you’re killing yourself by not moving more and not eating less."
running,fdpnztw,t3_emm0uu,1578634196.0,If it’s a bit too much to pick up the pace for long enough to pass them I’d honestly slow down for a bit of a breather and let some distance build up between us and then pick back up.
running,fdpleo3,t3_embsa6,1578631884.0,"Ive always looked to exercise as a source of confidence and pride although I’ve never really been what most people would call “Fit” aside from the majority of my time in high school when I was at least an acceptable weight and stronger than the average girl but I’ve never been what I would really call “confident”.  Especially after gaining 60 pounds, dropping out of high school, being dumped by my fiancée, diving head first into as many drug habits as I could, and isolating myself as much as possible for two solid years. 

Where I’m going with this is that i gave myself every reason to think I’m worthless and incapable of being a functional person however, after I *slowly* worked my way back into the gym to lift again and eventually gained enough stamina back that I don’t feel like a fool for running outside, I found that I can actually work myself up to being more social and assertive in situations where id have rather have gone completely unnoticed and my voice would be shaky and I’d have trouble stringing together a complete sentence. 

Lifting and running has given me the gift of even being able to move on from people who I felt had left me in the dust. 

It’s strange the way physically caring for yourself can actually get you to care emotionally as well.  So I wouldn’t really call it a cure, but an essential building block, yes absolutely."
running,fdpk2yp,t3_emixk2,1578630787.0,If you’re putting your safety first when there’s an abundance of horrible stories about people who have been attacked while out for a jog or run then you are in fact not the asshole
AskReddit,fdnzoll,t3_elssvy,1578596116.0,I used to think that sex was just peeing on each other in bed because at the time the only “pleasurable” sensation I knew of that involved that area was relieving ones self
abortion,fdh6u8y,t1_fdgog5y,1578416641.0,Thank you for clarifying!

abortion,fdg08yz,t1_fdfzams,1578375375.0,"Sorry if I keep bombarding you with questions I’ve just been constantly doing research and planning for a few days now until I can get tested and I can’t stop all of the questions racing through my head right now.
 
Do you know if many women have had success raising money through something like gofundme? In South Carolina if that’s considered “public funding” I’m screwed though.  And “discouraging” counseling is required but I can’t find anything detailing what that’s like- I mean do they say things that are medically inaccurate like having an increased risk of cancer or losing your fertility or do they subject you to pro life propaganda that is supposed to make you feel like a monster? 

Also I have O- blood and I’ve read some vague info on PP’s website and other that allude to additional testing or medications for women with negative blood types being something that is required which makes me terrified that the cost of a medical abortion in a clinic for me would be even more expensive than the “average” of about $500 dollars. Is that something that would also make a self managed abortion risky?"
abortion,fdfywkp,t1_fdfy479,1578374148.0,It’s not clear exactly how they get the pills to you- do they actually ship them directly to you if you have a PO Box? And When you went through a clinic did you ask about a discount? I will definitely need the help if I end up going through PP but no one is specific about the amount of money they can discount from your bill or if they allow balances like at a regular doctors office or payment plans. And is my income going to affect the discount? I’ve found two funding organizations that might be able to help but there’s also no testimony to how much they might be able to spare. I’m just trying to do my best to plan financially because if I end up without all of the money I need I might have to involve my mother and then there’s a whole new world of problems and heartbreak.
abortion,fdfxz8g,t1_fdfxuta,1578373341.0,Can I ask a couple more questions that I’ve had trouble finding the answer to on aidaccess’s website or from anyone who’s used their service?
