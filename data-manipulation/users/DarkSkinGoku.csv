offmychest,ffawcuu,t3_esi01m,1579746014.0,That’s some good shit right there! At least someone is winning out there.
offmychest,fdqwpyq,t3_emtioo,1578675963.0,"That’s your problem, your overthinking things when you see a cute girl and I’ll admit I can too but it’s just a person. Also I’m not a big talker until I’m comfortable with you so it’s more forced so things don’t go quiet. You just need something to relax yourself just a tinnny bit to take the nerves away and just be yourself. Also suicide isn’t the answer! There are millions of people that are in your spot but it’s not the end of the world. Also try to stop watching porn if you do frequently because when you meet a girl that could pop up in your mind and get you anxious. They say it helps with social skills. (They aka the internet so take it with some salt or whatever they say)"
dbfz,fdqpika,t1_fdqn8f4,1578672088.0,Yeah I’ll enter no guarantee I’ll wake up on time for it but it’s worth checking out
dragonballfighterz,fdqmszt,t1_fdo39st,1578670380.0,Yay! Jiren buff! Jiren buff! Jiren buff!!!
dbfz,fdqmpzc,t3_emcsyh,1578670325.0,I like this system it really makes u choose carefully with the limited points your allowed and tools the characters have
dragonballfighterz,fdqmcvx,t3_emg1ca,1578670088.0,Haven’t really done played Jiren online but ever since I got the game I have aspired to main him and maybe janemba def base vegeta too I’m prob gonna pick those 2 up today
dragonballfighterz,fdqlsr1,t1_fdpzy1x,1578669724.0,So they just randomly unlock it and wait for u to notice?
dragonballfighterz,fdnvg20,t1_fdniqit,1578593651.0,Really nice thanks for the info !
dragonballfighterz,fdnei42,t3_em80jk,1578584092.0,Yeah that would help because a janemba Auto combo always opened me up until I learned it was a side switch idk how I didn’t notice... also gt Goku he’s so small I’m not sure when he’s going low so I always block low until he jumps. Dlc characters grant a small advantage over some players but only for a short time and that’s the element of surprise and lack of experience with their block strings and moves for me at least. Unless u research them before hand.
dragonballfighterz,fdndmoh,t3_em8zww,1578583555.0,As a janemba player what are some of his strengths and weakness? I want to run a team of him Jiren and ssj Goku because I seen janemba’s assist is pretty nice for Jiren corner combos.
dragonballfighterz,fdnddd1,t1_fdncw8d,1578583392.0,I can’t pull off a loop...grant it I haven’t really tried  enough to do it yet

offmychest,fcq3ehi,t3_eibdao,1577877859.0,"That would have been me tonight cause I’m not really a social person and had a lot of anxiety swelling up when I was omw to my friends place. We’re all friends for years and hang out but I don’t really go out with them, but I told myself that this year I would be social and just be lit so I started early had a good time and still am! So good luck to everyone this year and have funnn!!!"
gtaonline,fcjfmyj,t1_fcjfdqq,1577685850.0,I just asked if the optional shit raises the cut. Yes or no? It’s a no then calm down.

skyrim,fc7z1zm,t1_fc7wyk3,1577522459.0,Yeah I have a save that I’m not using any mods on but I just made a new one and am testing some mods along with graphics. I might just use a graphics mod for my main game just to spice it up but nothing else.
skyrim,fc7wvx8,t3_egisdk,1577520779.0,If this is my first play through should I pop on some texture mods or run through it raw? If you said yes to that question then what are some good texture mods?
wholesomememes,fc7wjyj,t3_egkbai,1577520522.0,Don’t do that....don’t give me hope
