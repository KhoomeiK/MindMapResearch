Victim mentality itself is a good thing to be aware of, but it seems it is being used here in the context of [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting) you, where it is being used as a reason to make you think you are at fault. 

Your situation is so similar to mine, except I wasn't safe at home either as my parents and siblings would also abuse me. For most of my life, I couldn't understand why I was treated that way, or why my actions/perception of things were so different than others. 

I realized recently that I have been a product of a [dysfunctional family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_family) and have been enacting these same behaviors instinctively. Try to see if any of these in the list relates to you. I thought that I was just shy and quiet too, but I never realized the other behaviors and micro expressions that I was broadcasting to human society.

Read, learn and educate yourself on your situation. It is good you know about boundaries, continue building and establishing them as they are your foundation to lean on. Once you are more aware, you can then address specific behaviors and conditions you have and start to improve and heal.

One thing that really helped me is exercising and going to the gym. My mental and physical senses sharpened, and it also released a lot of built up stress within me.

Try just talking to her about things, do it in the behaviour that you wish you were treated, or you think how your sister wished she was treated.

He also treated me and called me the ""black sheep"" of the family or the ""problem child"", simply because I was the youngest.

Both my dad and my mom would value the opinions and wants of other people more than mine. They would not protect me from abuse from my older brothers, or from anyone else in that regard. Whenever I confronted my mom about the abuse of my older siblings, my mom would say stuff like ""He just loves you and know's what's best, just let it happen"" , or  ""God says we must forgive, so just love each other"".

It sounds like you are trying to understand your situation. Please take a read on [dysfunctional families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_family). This made me aware and understand what was going on with my family. Once you become aware, then you can start addressing the specific behaviors and heal.

To say that they are blood relatives and you love them sounds like appeasement to me, where you are just keeping the peace at any cost. The cost being your mental health and sanity.

depression,fdsllm0,t3_emynvo,1578704773.0,"Hey, I hope you read what I wrote down below, I think that your problems are addressable and a bright future can happen. Happy birthday in advance :)

\#1: This could be a [cognitive distortion](https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/) called 11- Emotional Reasoning, where you may feel a certain way, but that doesn't necessarily reflect reality or what is actually happening. You have the right to feel happy, but sometimes we are born in environments that doesn't make us happy. Us growing up in this environment could automatically make us think certain decisions or behaviors are ""good"" and ""normal"" because that's what we were born in, but you can change it and create your own happiness.

\#2: Everyone struggles to get out of bed everyday. If you just look at the quotes of celebrities for example, some of them mention that they force themselves to get up everyday and struggle to be where they are today. Our bodies have evolved to conserve the most amount of energy, by literally just existing and not wanting to do anything. Start with simple goals, or things you want to look forward to in the future. Let's say you love eating eggs and bacon for breakfast, so wake up and look forward to doing that.

\#3: Anyone who tells you that there are ""bigger"" problems than what you have are belittling you and your problems, whether they unconsciously intend to do so or not. And that includes you, yourself telling you that. You are belittling yourself in your own head, when in fact you are a human being and worth fighting for. Read, learn and be aware of your own feelings and emotions, then acknowledge and accept them. But you don't have to judge them.

\#4: Logic is only 50%. The other 50% is emotions. It seems you are either going only emotional, or only logical. The perfect balance is 50-50, and you can achieve this by acknowledging and accepting both your emotional needs/wants with the strategic thought of your logical thinking. Read up on the [""Wise Mind""](https://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/what-is-wise-mind)

\#5; You are wallowing in pity, or rather known as self-pity. This is extremely toxic, and I try to avoid it as much as possible myself.

\#6: The part where ""everyone hates you"" may be a cognitive distortion. If it is not, then know that bottling or dismissing your emotions will make it harder to have interpersonal relationships. Instead, accept them for what they are without passing judgement.

\#7: What works for me is exercise, workout in the gym. Try to find a stress-reliever you can do almost everyday. For immediate effects, try mindfulness meditation, where you focus on your breathing or the feeling of the clothes on your back, this will make you realize you are in the present and not some imagination in your mind.

\#8: I am exactly the same way, and I still have trouble sleeping and memories persist in my dreams as well. First of all, I don't think you are truly stoic, you just haven't learned how to manage or accept your feelings yet, otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation. The ""stoic"" people just learned to instantly dismiss or bury their feelings.

\#9: I feel this too, but we are in this world for a limited time, so might as well make the best of it. If all of this didn't matter anyway, then when we die it'll be the same thing, so might as well make the best of what we have.

\#10: I would call ""comparing yourself to others in an inferior manner"" a survival/defence mechanism, not necessarily a basic human nature.  This mechanism could be a cognitive distortion, #6 - Personalization. Aside from that, competitiveness itself is not inherently bad, that's how we advance our civilization. It seems you are mixing two different concepts together. Instead, try comparing yourself to your past self, and see if you have gotten better.

\#11. I don't know your situation or your life, but if you say your life changed from happiness to sadness, then wouldn't it stand to reason it can also change from sadness to happiness at any given time? But even still, you would be under the control of your emotions in this case, when in fact, you can be the one controlling what you feel. You cannot control other people, but you can most definitely control yourself.

\#12. Take your time, one step at a time. This life, there is no rush. We all have our own journeys and paths to walk.

\#13. Regarding chest pains, please see a doctor. It seems you are basing your happiness on what your friends think and on what happens the next day, this could be a cognitive distortion #7 - Control Fallacies. Try to rely on yourself for happiness, slowly but surely this is the correct way.

BPD,fdsfy1s,t3_emzo9i,1578701894.0,"This sudden sinking despair you speak of, this is exactly what I feel.

I come from a very dysfunctional and abusive family. My dad was the major abuser and my mom became a dependent on that. My mom became an appeaser, regardless of what abuse she saw infront of her, either through my dad or my siblings, and lived in complete denial. I moved out of my family's place since 3 years ago and have not physically seen any of my parents or siblings since then.

6 months ago, I sent a goodbye email to my dad explaining in vague terms how there is so much dysfunction and mental illness in our family, and how we are probably never going to talk again. He sort of just dismissed it with a one sentence ""I'm sorry"", and promptly went back to his denial/deflecting ways.

Just 2 weeks ago, I decided to send an email to my mother, detailing examples of her [dysfunctional behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_family) and matching them to the terminologies in that wiki link. At the very least, I felt I had to try to save my mother, even if the chance is extremely low. I told her to re-read the email multiple times in a span of a few weeks and not rush in judgement or replying to me. So far, she has only been casually sending me her usual pictures of her with other distant relatives without a word of that email.

Shortly after, I received an email from my dad expressing his sadness of what the family has become, but it was clear to me he was still deflecting blame and belilttling the ""causes"" of these issues. I then also emailed him a similar email of highlighting his behavior inconjunction with articles I find on the internet. He has not replied at all this time.

I think both responses from dad and mom are extremely good, because it breaks their usual pattern of habit. But even if it fails, at least I tried while maintaining a safe distance for my own personal mental health.

Whenever I feel like unwelcomed, disliked or unwanted, I think the best way is to be empathetic to yourself. Give yourself the things you feel you were never given. Example: If your dad never consoled you, then console yourself. 

Know that emotions and feelings are just that, they come and go as fast as the wind. If you crank up any emotion to the max level, whether it be sadness, anger or happiness, physiologically speaking, they are all the same. (Your heart beats faster, your breather harder, you sweat, etc)

Practice some mindfulness meditation and acknowledge your feelings/memories, but you don't have to judge them.

If it's your family not listening or belittling you (rolling eyes/""he only wants attention""), this could be a product of [dysfunctional behaviors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_family).  These behaviors most likely stems from previous generations doing the same to your parents, and unto you and/or your siblings, so now they think it is just normal to do. If its your friends/associates, it could be they don't understand or know how to respond to your situation.

You mentioned you always do your best to talk/listen to others, but feel nobody does that for you, including the people your always there for. First, it's good to know if this is just a [cognitive distortion](https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/) you have. Please look at #8-Fallacy of Fairness in the list, perhaps also #10-Shoulds or #15-Heaven's Reward. 

Otherwise, based on what you said how they show their ""concern"" was, it's usually just hard for people to have good empathy skills, or know how to properly respond to such things.  As for not meeting conditions to receiving empathy, I think the best way is to be empathetic to yourself, and give yourself all of these things you wish other people are giving you.

One thing I can tell you is that I am here right now, replying to your thread, which means you are worth it.

You can choose to wallow back into this state anytime and feel sorry for yourself, or you can choose to learn more about your situation to be more aware, and then choose to be more empathetic so you can heal yourself and others.
