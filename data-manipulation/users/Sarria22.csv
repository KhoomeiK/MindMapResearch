MonsterHunterWorld,ff4rh3v,t1_ff3k9v1,1579570673.0,"It's not just the saving thing, it's the way they interact in cutscenes in general that it's pretty clear they're close friends"

Yes, ""We."" as in she was there supporting you. As in she's the reason you can restock your items, change your gear, and eat a meal in camp after carting. Previous hunters didn't have anyone to run the camp and do all the organization that bringing your entire supply of gear to camp with you takes."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff37e2m,t1_ff349a8,1579535454.0,">in the ancient forest... where the monsters are... without an escort, let alone a weapon...

It's pretty clear from the other NPCs wandering around the maps on their own that the regions are relatively safe in normal conditions. Most monsters are relatively docile if you just let them be and don't hang around close to them and making them feel threatened, much like real animals. Even elder dragons will usually just ignore you unless you attack them.

Basically if we're gonna give the handler shit about it we'd also need to give the assorted researcher NPCs shit about it too, but I don't really think we need to give anyone shit about it because normally it's no more dangerous than going for a walk in the forest where there might be bears and cougars and shit in real life."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff36o37,t1_ff33klz,1579534963.0,"Yeah, it's prett clear from the cutscenes that, despite what the player might think, the Hunter actually cares about the Handler."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff36j3j,t1_ff3482b,1579534869.0,I think the idea is that the whole POINT of the research commission is to research things. That would make the Handlers the main attraction and the hunter their muscle to keep them safe. The handlers do the field work the commission is there to do and the hunters make sure they are safely able to by being scarier than the monsters.

Evil would be that same situation, but also you're directly responsible for the situation the man in where if he doesn't get fish he'll die, or if the man was unable to learn for some reason instead of simply refusing to learn."
