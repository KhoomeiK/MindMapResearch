worldnews,feowbxr,t1_feovv0c,1579306804.0,"I don't think this situation is comparable at all to a sports stadium though, nor to the Foxconn manufacturing plant example.

We are talking about white collar jobs here, requiring highly skilled people with high salaries. These are not the type of roles Amazon would build an entire campus for and then randomly decide not to hire afterwards. That doesn't make sense even in a late-stage capitalist environment. 

Agree with you that states competing with one another to outbid on corporate welfare is problematic at best, but you're talking about effectively removing States' very few methods of attracting and retaining business (tax breaks). What can smaller or uneducated states do to attract business if they aren't allowed to compete with states like New York or California?"

Comparing Amazon to Foxconn is false equivalence: there's no reason to expect two separate business entities will behave similarly in two completely different industries and circumstances."
technology,fejjtcf,t1_fej9pna,1579177216.0,There’s a lot of evidence to suggest it’s plausible. The courts will decide if that constitutes proof or not though.

There’s no need to be skeptical, it’s just accounting based on the best science available. Same thing goes for most forms of preventative medicine. It’s orders of magnitude cheaper to prevent infection in thousands than treat a dozen people."
