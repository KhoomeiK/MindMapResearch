socialskills,ffupmk1,t1_ffupjj5,1580246890.0,Hey why are you guys only talking amongst each other. I don’t like wasting my time and I don’t understand why I’m here if we’re all not going to talk to each other.
socialskills,ffuocxm,t1_ffszjy5,1580246173.0,Yeah I experience the same thing. And then I break out and confront then look like that bad guy.
socialskills,ffsv3jy,t3_ev1lu8,1580193641.0,Same. I deal with this everyday. Peoples attention spans are so small nowadays.
socialskills,ffsv1p4,t3_ev1rtz,1580193584.0,"I have the same problem. But for me I just leave. Too much anxiety to deal with. I try to do my effort to speak up but if nothing happens on their end, it’s just one sided."
offmychest,ffsnhgo,t3_ev02dl,1580186264.0,You got this.
offmychest,ffsncpd,t3_euygu9,1580186156.0,This post made my night. I honestly made a YouTube vlog about this. I’m not sorry for being who I am and if I’m going thru shit I’m going to open up about it.
