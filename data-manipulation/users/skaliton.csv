The ICC is basically the permanent Nuremberg court. As he said before the US is not a party to the statute, which is the fancy legal way to say isn't obligated to do anything with/for the court.  It focuses on only criminal law/people individually or as a group. The rules of evidence would be quite familiar to the average US citizen with one major exception. Hearsay is admissible. Not in a lawyerly work around way- it is just admissible. The cases last for a long time and the investigation actually continues while the trials are ongoing. It is much more focused on making the victims feel better/whole than normal criminal trials where the victim is usually nothing more than a key witness. So often times there will be witnesses whose testimony is basically nothing beyond 'they came through my village and murdered all the men' and hours of crying/saying how horrible the defendant/their soldiers/whatever is. The hearings are broadcasted openly and especially in the war torn area or wherever, because it really is about making them feel whole again. People will be hired to explain what is going on.

&#x200B;

The court gets alot of bad press some which is deserved because it is often used to basically abduct some guy in africa, in fact this describes most of their cases ever. It makes sense because it often means either the warlord gets brought to the court or the victims really don't get justice because the impoverished wartorn nation doesn't exactly have a functioning court YET (it will, the international community is huge on this kind of thing, like I cannot express enough how much the US and other nations do to basically build a legal system)

Now the ICJ has two different rulings. There are binding ones and advisory ones- unlike in the US it can essentially make up a case and 'theoretically' rule on it which basically means nothing except to academia. Overall this is more comparable to an appellate court in the US in how it is presented. (if you are curious look up any moot court ever) these cases also take A LONG TIME, but for a very different reason, rather than having victims come up and cry virtually every nation has an opportunity to be heard, meaning they send their brightest academics in the field of international law and also experts in that specific area of law. If it sounds like I am phrasing it to imply this court ends up being 'porn for academia' . . .it kind of is. That said it makes rulings which end up influencing the entire world, and the rulings are often hundreds of pages long. For example:

Here this may explain why HK is in the position it is in. Comparing it to Florida (a state which has been a state since 1845) is completely disingenuous. HK has only been part of China since  . . .18 wait I mean 1997. They don't use the same currency even.  

&#x200B;

Your inclusion of Japan also makes no sense. Yes it was wrong and no one is going to deny that, but it is irrelevant. And beyond that it happened and is 'done' we can't go back in time to undo it. We can stop the Chinese government/HK gov't from doing harm. As in they could stop at any moment and not make it worse."
