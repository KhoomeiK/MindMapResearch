offmychest,ffi77e1,t1_ffhurk6,1579966898.0,"Thank you. Thank you so so much for this reply. I'm genuinely crying right now reading it. It's so kind and thoughtful and helpful and loving. You're a beautiful person for showing so much kindness to a stranger on the internet.

I will try all of this, slowly, but I'll try."
offmychest,ffhtgb0,t1_ffhrnpn,1579953031.0,"I used to place my value in my academics. I felt I was good at it and it gave me solace as something I could turn to, but lately (past two years or so), I've slowly been feeling that my academic ability is also not actually very good. 

How does one learn to love themselves? I see it said on the internet, but what should one do to get to that point? I know my self-esteem is low and that is probably hurting my relations with people and myself. But I don't know how to lift that :/ I've been seeing a therapist, and I think it has helped to talk to someone about these things. Lately I've definitely been experiencing a lot of self hatred and self loathing and I've started an antidepressant and anti-anxiety treatment and I know that's going to take time to work too. 

I guess, I just yearn to be loved and wanted and have people to talk to and share experiences with."

I hope you do find real friends who want you around because it really sucks. Still brings me to tears thinking of all the times I was left out."
classicminis,fdg3u4j,t1_fde177r,1578378976.0,Rain on the back window isn't too much of an issue really. I guess it does keep the water off the window.
offmychest,fdcx731,t3_eki8ru,1578286950.0,That's amazing! You're amazing! Congratulations on everything you've done! This is properly motivating!
classicminis,fd42ult,t3_ejvn8h,1578163856.0,This is amazing! Great to see a Mini going on a proper long adventure! Thank you for sharing it :)
classicminis,fckg8gw,t3_ehmv0f,1577724637.0,Awwww! Adorable! :)
classicminis,fcjy9b4,t1_fcjy1go,1577710272.0,"Yeah... been seeing the news and posts about that. Hope you and the family are alright. It's a scary time for the people in those states. Doesn't seem to be too many in Victoria though, right?   
That is properly cool! You and your dog on a proper adventure! I must admit, I'd be scared to drive by myself. Maybe with a passenger, but always scared about breaking down somewhere in the sticks with no one around to help.   
But yeah, it's been my dream since I got the Mini to take a drive from Cape Town up along the coast and then up to Botswana."
classicminis,fcjxw1y,t3_ehja7b,1577709830.0,"That is amazing! Would love to take a trip around South Africa in the Mini one day! Definitely needs work before I would be confident for such a trip. 

Did you drive in convoy with others? or were you by yourself?"
