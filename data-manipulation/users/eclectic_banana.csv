formula1,fftl26e,t1_fftdkv8,1580223305.0,Exactly. The bike looks crazy but Seb is a different kind of personality.

Me and my girlfriend broke up a month ago, I don't have friends and my parents never understood me, also my VGA in my main rig died two days ago so I'm on a cheap laptop right now... Thinking about my situation too much makes me more than sad but deep down I know that life wants to teach me something so I can became stronger. So this is my message to you: doesn't matter what happens, believe in yourself, accept life's highs and lows and have faith that there are better days ahead.

Cheers for a brighter future!"

wholesomememes,fcn2qkq,t1_fcmvxoo,1577801625.0,"You're right, the material world only makes us happy for a shirt time. We get what we dream of, we celebrate that for five minutes then our brain switches to the next thing it desires and there you have an unfulfilled life.

 It's great to have the things you always wanted but what I found is that human relationships make life much more meaningful. Sharing that wealth with others, being there for them, going through tough times together - all these things make the time we spend here colorful."
