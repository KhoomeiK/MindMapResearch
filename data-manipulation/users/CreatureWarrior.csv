AskScienceDiscussion,fepssvu,t1_feozkq2,1579330055.0,"I mean, we get our temp from genes and they do indeed stay with us until we pass. But life experiences create the rest and often our perceptions of the world are shaped by our temp. 

If one is really extroverted, they will most likely hang around more people thus becoming more socially fluent(of course it can go in a different direction too) than an introverted child. And those social skills affect our relationships and future experiences while constantly shaping our personality(probably not dramatically) and behavior.

So in my opinion it's pretty naive to say that ""that person is bad due to her bad genes(atleast 50% anyway). It depends. If a child is aggressive by nature and that child's parents don't teach the child to control those impulses of violent behavior, of course the effect genes are more visible than with a child who learns to channel their violence towards sports for example.
