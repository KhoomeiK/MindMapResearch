AskReddit,fft8wd0,t1_ffsh3fg,1580212662.0,"I've noticed those who rag on other for going to college will come up with 1000 excuses related to cost on why they didn't go.

Like those problems didn't exist for other attendees.  Its called a loan.  They just don't wanna know."
gaming,ffnfzl6,t1_ffncmvq,1580065409.0,USPS seems to be much better in my opinion.  Say what you will I think our postal service works pretty damn well for the domestic US.

AskReddit,ffcjw0k,t3_ess76y,1579801022.0,"Migraine, a real one.  Not those bullshit headaches you mom's love calling migraines.  A migraine leaves you writhing in a pain for a few hours in a dark room."

news,ff7il1m,t3_erwarz,1579650394.0,"Good but even this is a half step.  Companies have experienced record breaking profits as well as numerous tax breaks over the last few years but refuse to increase salaries.  Delta is like the red headed step child doing this. 

They do shit like more employee training and other bullshit that allows them to save face, keep wages the same while saving even more taxes. My theory is they know shit is going down in the next few years whether it be global warming, population, water supply etc they will need cash on hand.  Paying people more now has no ROI."
gadgets,ff44uk8,t3_erhwzw,1579555573.0,"Just to show how bullshit the commercials are they had a series mocking the iPhone for not having a headphone port.

Then they removed it on their next generation Galaxy series...

Also I love how unrealistic these commercials are, yeah a 30 year old blonde women is not going to buy an iPhone because it doesn't have a microSD slot and she doesn't want her stuff in the cloud.  The average consumer probably doesn't even know what one is.  I'm just saying they are reaching hard on some of these commercials.
 
Apple is very good at what they do, they don't make a decision unless they are confident it will work out.  Example look at the removal of the headphone port and airpods.  Its like Samsung forget this when they make these dumb ass commercials that target people who think they understand consumer technology.  Just another reason this whole Android vs Apple argument is silly.  Every company does things differently."

todayilearned,fexvmbj,t1_fexdql7,1579437174.0,We are.  It called crypto currency and blockchain.  Give it a few years.
television,fetnra6,t3_eqhgr4,1579377327.0,I know this isn't a popular opinion but I think the scene where Walter is ripping his wife to shreds in the last season over the phone.  He was essentially abandoning everything he worked so hard for to give them a way out.  He was kinda making himself to be the husband Skyler tried to make him out to be too which killed him because that wasn't the truth.  The strange mix of him not meaning some of what he was saying while at the same time being sincere about others while knowing it was the last time they would talk was heartbreaking.  So much more to that scene too.

todayilearned,fepq53u,t1_feolo6l,1579327568.0,"Yeah I realize now stupid this comment is.  He was a fucking complete idiot.  Sorry for wasting your time guys.  Also at no point did I mean for my comment to sound like I was justifying or supporting what he did/terrorism.  What he did is absolutely unexcusable no matter the circumstances.  Violence is never the answer, as mah boy, the pussy destroyer Ghandi said an ""eye for an eye makes the whole world blind""."
todayilearned,fep2mks,t1_feozp1p,1579310751.0,"Exactly.  Greed/self interest is a great tool for invention and is the reason why we have what we have.  People want more money, or they don't wanna have to plow the field everyday, or do math manually etc so they invent, usually out of self interest but good regulations ensure the invention doesn't only benefit a few or used by a few to use and exploit what's meant for many."
todayilearned,feoy69w,t1_feors2q,1579307942.0,"Sure I'm not a simpleton.  No way do I think the answer is to abandon these wonderful inventions and progress but regulation, regulation and more regulation.  Motivation should be guided by self interest/selfishness but the market should be defined by it's rules and regulations.  When you allow self interest and greed to define the market everyone just fucks each other over while they can.  Its in the best interest of everyone to make sure no one takes advantage of public goods and you do that by regulating the market."
todayilearned,feoxutr,t1_feouof8,1579307746.0,"Good point, maybe I am overestimating the relevance of his manifesto."
todayilearned,feoqdgq,t1_feopm9m,1579303916.0,True but you can deny some of his ideas and the overarching theme was not way ahead of it's time.
todayilearned,feolo6l,t3_eq4xlf,1579301930.0,"I know I'm gunna sound crazy but the Unabomber was just a genius ahead of his time who chose the absolute wrong way to effect change.

Read his manifesto.  Its genius.  He saw what unchecked industry what would do to our planet.  He just chose the worst/most unforgivable way to communicate his ideas. 

Kinda sad how people ignore his ideas because of it but when millions of us are starving to death due to climate change I bet you any one of us would do the same thing as the Unabomber if it gave us a chance of avoiding that terrible future."
personalfinance,feohunm,t1_fek46l2,1579300428.0,"Are you seriously arguing a single mother who has a small bump that is not having any symptoms is going spend that $1000 she spent months saving on a test she might not even need.  Also best case scenario she actually needed it and it means more money for more tests.  I think she would rather spend that 1000 on treating herself or her kids or buying necessaries. Point is that amount has to be trivial in order for you to not miss it.  Not alot of people who consider $800 a trivial amount of money, nice to know you do though.  Good for you. 


You are so out of touch it's not funny.  Its fucking sad.

What are you going to suggest next, that they just pull themselves up from their bootstraps?"

news,feilkqo,t1_feg1e5o,1579141372.0,"Nah Tom is smart.  Never admit that you smoke until it fully legalized and accepted.  Even if everyone is accepting someone will start making passive aggressive comments and treating you different.  Even almost all companies in legal states still test and will fire you immediately if they hear that rumor.  Especially in a community of busy bodies.  It will be...

""Oh man, how did you forget that?  You better slow down on that reefer"".

""What are you eating so much have you got the munchies"".

""No wonder you don't wanna do x or go out with y.  You are always high"".

Also if anyone gets in any legal trouble, even the smallest thing get ready for them to give your name up and your house to be raided.

Do not admit to smoking unless the other person smokes.  Especially to people over the age of 30.  You have nothing to gain.  

So no Tom isn't an asshole, he is a smart head who is too smart to make the same mistake twice.  People are assholes and hate anything they don't personally do or understand."

Fuck it I'll wait and see if the lump gets bigger.  I hope there is a special place in hell for these people.
