We may not get the gory specifics of their experiences in the aftermath of the outbreak but we get enough to fill in the blanks for the tension between them. 

Joel led them down a dark path just to survive, seems pretty clear they did some heinous things that have weighed on Tommy's conscience. We are pretty much told explicitly that Joel killed and robbed people (presumably relatively innocent, definitely seems clear that it was not in self defense). Maybe they were joined up with a larger group like we saw in Pittsburgh, seems implied at least. That group must have done some horrific shit, and Joel dragged Tommy down that path.

I grabbed the exact dialogue just to show how clearly they state it.

>Tommy: [Pauses.] You want some gear, sure. But I ain't taking that girl off your hands. [Stands up.]

The following two main Zelda games were A Link Between Worlds, the first Zelda game that allowed you to tackle dungeons in any order, and featured very little tutorials or handholding outside of a useable hint item, and Breath of the Wild.

I know this isn't really that crucial to the point you're trying to make, but both the original LoZ and Link to the Past dungeons can be completed in more or less any order, besides just a couple instances where a specific item obtained in one dungeon may be needed in another. Even in those cases you could go snag the item and then come back and complete the dungeon later while moving on to a different one."

You might get a better idea of where your paces should be by using a VO2 calculator like below, if you have a recent all out race effort time you can use as a baseline.

Maybe earlier in 2021, I'd be absolutely floored (but ecstatic) to see something this year though. 

Even if they have some internal 2020 date planned, any internal release schedule is almost certain to be delayed, maybe multiple times over, as the game grows.

It's the same reason final releases always have unused assets and cut content buried in them. You'll often see dataminers turn up that stuff, right? An entire cut map area, unused character models, etc.

A massive project such as a game like this has an insane number of interconnecting parts that are often developed, and then tested, by separate teams simultaneously. 

Testing and bug hunting in a video game of all things must be a *hugely* cost intensive process (time and money) as all of these parts are interwoven. To yank out any seemingly unrelated string from one end could have potential ripple effects across any number of other systems that were unanticipated. 

Theoretically you *should* be able to yank a lot of that unused stuff without consequence, and I bet they probably often could and it would be just fine. But they would still need to test everything all over again to be sure. And then burn even more time and money hunting down any newly introduced problems and fixing them. It's just not worth it when you can just hide that shit instead.

Now personally I would think with this demo situation it would be worth some effort to remove big reveal later game stuff and just doing some quick passes for complete gamebreaking bugs, while being comfortable taking on some increased risk of someone stumbling on random quirky bugs since it's just a demo. But I'm not a business/marketing guy so maybe that's a bad idea.
