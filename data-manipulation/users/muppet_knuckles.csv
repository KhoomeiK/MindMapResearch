I don't normally respond to these, a lot of points always get made so quick, but seriously

Long story short, when I was 19, hearing my girlfriend at the time was pregnant, I questioned if it was mine. She terminated the pregnancy but I way later found out after we broke up that she had cheated on me, got pregnant and made up a rape story to explain it, the whole time saying it was mine

I *know* this is a completely different story but just like women have absolutely every right to their body and the decisions to be made about it, a guy fucking deserves to know if a kid is his

Could he have maybe handled it a little better, even with the, you know, extremely shocking news that, despite 2 forms of birth control, you got pregnant? Sure, probably, although again, shock. But you absolutely could've handled it better"
