The second thing he said is that Cowboy folded, didn't show up, or gave up. That is what Joe and others have issue with.

DnDGreentext,fcvl0b5,t1_fcvjcmu,1578004355.0,"Yeah I know the feeling. I'm pretty new to the game myself. I played a oneshot in college more than a decade ago, and that's it until like a month ago when I took the plunge and started DMing a campaign with some friends (who have also never played before) because I couldn't find a game to play in. One of them is a Paladin, so I've been learning all about it so I can help them navigate their character.

I will say though that I've been watching D&D streams for years now, and devouring all kinds of content about the game online and on youtube and stuff. It's becoming a borderline addiction at this point lol"
DnDGreentext,fcvidjs,t1_fcvhhv4,1578002727.0,"The smite spells are separate from the attack you make with your weapon. All of the smite spells have a bonus action casting time, so you cast (for example) branding smite as a bonus action, and then you make a melee attack with your action. If that melee attack lands, the spell is expended adding the spell's damage to the melee attack, and then you can add divine smite. This is where it is different from the Green Flame Blade and Booming Blade cantrips, which are both cast as **actions** and *includes* the weapon attack roll.*

This is because the smite spells are all **1 minute concentration spells**. This means that if you miss on the attack roll after you cast the spell, your branding smite spell is still active, waiting for you to land your next melee attack as long as you maintain concentration on the spell. Since paladins can make 2 attacks per turn (after 5th level, that is), you get two chances for the spell to land. If you miss both attacks, you can keep concentrating and the spell will still be active, waiting for you to land an attack on your next turn.

HOWEVER, what this also means is that you can't keep concentration on any of the paladin's many buff spells the class is known for, like aid, bless, or the many aura spells, so the smite spells do come at a cost.


 *the wording of BB and GFB cantrips says ""As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails."""
DnDGreentext,fcvg9um,t1_fcvfo2u,1578001469.0,"You are correct that **divine smite** requires a successful weapon attack. The wording of the ability says:

>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack ...

So yes, you can only use the **divine smite** ability when you successfully land a melee attack.

But here's the thing, a **smite spell** is *both* a melee weapon attack *and* a spell. 

If you look at the language of the **smite spells**, they all include this wording: 

>The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration...

So think of it this way: A **smite spell** effectively enchants your weapon, and that magic is expended the next time you land a successful melee weapon attack. Once you land that successful melee weapon attack, you can then add a divine smite.

Also, sorry for all the bolds and italics, I'm just trying to emphasize the specific differences between some very similar terms lol"
MMA,fcvf0bx,t1_fcveexa,1578000716.0,What are the odds Khabib is still fighting in another 2 years when they're able to book the fight again?
DnDGreentext,fcveggf,t1_fcvce28,1578000392.0,"Sorry, either I typed wrong or I wasn't clear enough leading to a misunderstanding. It's also a bit confusing because of the way it is all worded.

Just to be clear on terminology: There is **Divine smite**, the hallmark paladin ability, and then there are *different* **smite spells**: searing smite, thunderous smite, wrathful smite, branding smite, blinding smite, staggering smite, and banishing smite.

**Divine smite** isn't a *spell*, it's an **innate ability** that consumes a *spell slot*. Ticky tack distinction, but important nonetheless. This ability, as you correctly said, is ""cast"" after you hit as a free action (quotation marks because you don't actually cast it because it's not a spell). You land a hit, and you can just decide that you want to burn a spell slot to pump some additional holy fury into the hit.

The **smite spells** I listed above are actual spells, that are delivered via your weapon (like the Greenflame Blade or Booming Blade cantrips, for example). They're not innate abilities like divine smite. These *spells* are cast *before* you make the attack. The spell takes effect when you land an attack with your weapon, adding damage and other effects to the attack depending on which smite spell you use.

What this means though, is that you can cast one of these **smite spells**, land your hit, and then ALSO add **divine smite**, burning multiple spell slots on a single attack.  And if you are lucky enough to cast a **smite spell** before you make your attack roll, and then you land a critical hit on the attack using that **smite spell**, and then pump in a **divine smite**, you get the insane damage numbers I listed above.

In gameplay, it goes like this:

>""I cast branding smite."" (2nd level spell, can be upcast to add another 1d6 per additional level)

Roll to attack. Attack lands! Roll normal weapon damage, plus the extra 2d6 radiant damage from branding smite.

>""I will divine smite at 4th level.""

Add the additional 5d8 radiant damage of a 4th level divine smite.

So on this single attack, you spend a 2nd level spell slot to cast branding smite, and you spend a 4th level slot to add divine smite.

Now if the attack roll above was a critical hit, you double the weapon damage dice, the branding smite (spell) damage dice, and the divine smite (ability) damage dice. That's how you get up to 2d10 (weapon) + 4d6 (paladin smite spell) + 10d8 (paladin smite ability) + 2d8 (paladin improved smite ability) + StrMod + WeaponMod total damage."
