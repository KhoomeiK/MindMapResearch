apexlegends,ff9xi6r,t1_ff5xfst,1579723648.0,Wow that's lame. The way it's phrased I figured I had all the game modes worth. Otherwise I would have grinded it. Now I'm not sure I can complete the event track
BillBurr,ff537rx,t3_era1yp,1579578996.0,Why am I not surprised about Bills complete misunderstanding of of the Iran-Contra Affair.

MensRights,fen89zq,t1_fen4yh4,1579279147.0,"That's a single issue. And an important one, but to elect someone as blatantly corrupt as Trump isn't the solution. I'd argue it'd be better to elect someone more capable and less scummy and then show them the problems with Title IX.                    

It's also illogical, when your charge is that Title IX unduly punishes men wrongly accused of sexual assault, to rally behind a man who's openly admitted to sexual assault as your champion."
MensRights,fen2kc4,t1_femx6b5,1579275557.0,"Bernie, but honestly anybody in the primary. Trump is such an unfit , narcissistic moron that I'll be stuck voting the lesser of two evils.                 

I actually only registered Democrat the last election cycle. Actually run more independent. Voted 3rd party 2016 and used to have no problem doing so.               

But Republicans have so far jumped the shark by not just electing Trump, but worse, their continued undying support in the face of all his blatant corruption and profiteering that I'll never again vote Republican or 3rd party at the federal level. Until a new party (or multiples) rise to viability I'm a Democratic voter."
MensRights,fen25vd,t1_femirxt,1579275300.0,Trump isn't nor ever has been the logical choice.
politics,fegzc7y,t1_fegwi1y,1579105869.0,I also thought that was pretty dumb considering she was too cowardly to run in 2016 and is only running now that Bernie has paved the way for progressive ideas like single payer. It's pretty easy not to lose when you don't have the guts to play Liz.

ContraPoints,fcv1d3w,t1_fcu7if1,1577992624.0,">It used to be that gaming had more liberal connotations 

It still does. This tweet and all the people in this thread that think that gaming is some alt-right dominated hobby are delusional.                          

Gamers don't need to be ""won back"". It's not some tug of war zero sum game. Saying ""the right has gamers"" is like saying literature is ""owned by the right"" because white supremacists read books too."

witcher,fcmp1kl,t3_egkja7,1577785135.0,"This is why I love/hate reading other people criticisms. I enjoyed the season but something was bothering me about that episode (especially the fireball sacrifice, had the same thought of it being a waste) and now you've convinced me the episode is dogshit. If all magic has to be created from something (like they've established in this show and with the fireball martyrs) how the fuck did Yen make her magic nuke? Total Deus ex machina."
