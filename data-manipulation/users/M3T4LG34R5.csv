Its a basic speed nuke set up, HK gives you team a speed boost, SH gives atk up, Zarg places def down/softens them up, kael finishes them off

You have a couple really solid champs you can use anywhere. I’d focus on getting Zargala, Thenasil, and Captain Temila up. Zarg is a hard hitter with def down and extra attacks, thenasil is one of the better healers who also places def up, and Captain Temila is a fantastic support champ that can make sure your damage dealing champs make it to the boss"
