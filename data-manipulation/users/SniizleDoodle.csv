I was fortunate enough to find out, just today actually, that I do have more friends than I realized. Turns out, some of my friends were keeping quiet about their own battles. We all needed someone and felt alone. I'm so incredibly greatful to have them.  

Maybe reach out with some of your people just to check in. You might be surprised. 

In the mean time, Hit me up. Okay?

I mean it!"
