I've bought a galaxy s9 it's so much cheaper. Plus it's no contract so that's that. It was a concept created by xdadevelopers. They check the IMEI make sure it's not blacklisted all that jazz.

WatchPeopleDieInside,femkt2j,t1_fem3dbh,1579260539.0,"This. Recently went to the DMV at a time when I thought it would be slow. It wasn't. I waited in line to get a number for close to 30 minutes. I finally get to the ticket area waiting for the teller to flag me forward and some asian lady comes over with a smile and stands in front of me with her ""elderly"" grandma. I was dumb founded that she SKIPPED THE ENTIRE LINE BEHIND ME. Told her she can't do that and she asked why not my grandmother is ""elderly."" Took every ounce I had to not lose it. I responded I've been waiting for a half hour and so has the couple behind me. Maybe if you ask them instead of jumping in front of this entire line you might get what your looking for. So she asked and the couple said yes for whatever reason. No lady you can't cut me because your grandmother is old."
