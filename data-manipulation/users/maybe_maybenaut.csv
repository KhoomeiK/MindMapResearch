SuicideWatch,fdm37x2,t3_elz2tb,1578538742.0,"I’ve felt like this most of my life, and I’m in my forties now. I’ve gotten by, and never had the guts to kill myself though I think about it most days, even still. 

Sometimes I have a friend or two. Sometimes I have had a lady in my life. I will say this, there is someone out there for everybody. There’s a girl out there you’d think is cute who’s feeling just as much self doubt. Keep your eyes and heart open, don’t give up, and when the time is right you’ll find someone who clicks. 

My best advice is to find something you love, or at least like, and try to do that for living. Then you will suddenly be a winner over all those other dicks.. trust me.."
