I too, from time to time, remind myself of a different time, where my own thoughts would take me places and my feelings were clearly connected to much of what I was doing, e.g. drawing, painting, hiking etc., and so I found honest and deep pleasure by immersing myself in these activities. In this day and age, our own thoughts are much muffled up by external input (too many signals and no direction) and I do think this is the primary cause of the disconnect to ourselves. We lose direction and it all becomes options instead of choices. No wonder many are in the state of becoming numb. It's too much and too little at the same time."

He therefor decided by his own will, that he was going to do his best to pass the drivers test and if he did, he'd gift *me* with a bike. He made his own misfortune *my* blessing.

selfimprovement,ff45ihp,t1_ff41pi2,1579555994.0,"When you say that you feel like you're on the receiving end without having earned that position that tells you something. Your feelings are your own way to communicate a message that you're not paying enough attention to. 

What I meant by the looking into a mirror, is that you are focused on all these things that you receive and the gap between that and your efforts to earn it. To me, that sounds like someone who looks into the mirror and sees an imposter. The imposter syndrome is not at all rare. It's the nagging feeling or knowing if you will, that you haven't really gone the extra mile, that it all sort of just fell into your lap. It came too easy. 

There you have it. If you listen, to your feelings and pay attention to the things that stand out to you, the message is right there. Your own mind is trying to put you in another direction."
selfimprovement,ff3x1mn,t3_erfaax,1579550719.0,"When was the first time something made you feel unworthy? There might be something there to explore further. Reading your text it sounds as though you're holding on the feeling of being unworthy. 

The rest of the text doesn't bring attention to anything unusual. Many children now at days in modern society are left much to themselves, come from upper middle class homes and are somewhat spoiled. 

The only thing that really stands out is your way of viewing yourself as unworthy of gifts, time,    grammar school, being a priority to others and receiving gestures from others. I'm thinking, if you're so focused about how much others give to you and how much you're wasting everybody's time, it might be a mirror for you to look in. Often people notice things about others that they don't like about themselves or that they do like about themselves. 

Is your problem really that you feel that you don't get *enough* time from your parents and that  you feel like they're buying you off with enforcing shallow gifts onto you, which isn't nearly as worthy to you, as their time?"

It's a burden to carry, not to be able to guarantee your progress. It hurts. I'd like to see some progress in your situation, because I love you and cherish our friendship.

I don't have enough information about your situation yet, but one of my guesses is that you're suffering from the so-called 'brain-fog'. It happens if the mind is under too much strain, such as personal, social or practical issues. Other contributing factors can be alcohol, too much sugar, not enough exercise, not enough sleep, lack of certain vitamins and weak routines.

Of course I've been interviewed myself as well, when applying for jobs. In both cases it is absolutely true that thee conversation is supposed to flow naturally and not be characterised by speed and fast delivery. It is completely OK to pause and think about the question. You have to breath slowly and think of the people that are interviewing as people that you're just conversing with. It is also completely OK to be honest about the fact that you'd like to advance in your job and that you're looking for a job that will spark your motivation. You can then go ahead and say that this particular job that you're interviewing for does that for you because 1) it's got tasks that you haven't done before and would like to try and 2) you have experience that you can apply directly and 3) it feels like the right time to advance as it would make you happier in your job AND in your life. It's OK to talk about where you're at in life and where you'd like to be, as long as it is focused towards this specific job. Make it about them and how they are so interesting to you and then be honest about why you're interesting to them. Open their eyes and just go for it.

The reason is fear. Not fear of rejection but fear of the unknown. Progress and letting go of something that that has been a negative factor in a persons life for years, can be a scary progress, because it brings change. Try to put yourself in situations where you have to deal with the unknown. Pay attention to how you react. Come back once you've done that and we'll talk more."

However, a good mentor provokes you into either acknowledge or fend off possible reasons for your behaviour. Anything you say and do is information for the mentor and gives the person a look into your inner world. 

The good mentor will also hold you accountable for the impact of your actions by confronting you directly about your behaviour, e.g. pointing out how your negative behaviour affects their willingness to help you and asks you if you're aware of the fact  that you're irritating them with your negative acts. For example if you don't follow through on a promise that was essential for your progress, the mentor will confront you and say ""I cannot and therefor will not help you, if you don't follow through on the essential steps needed for your progress"". Usually you'll be given a new opportunity to correct the mistake and from this point there'll may have been a shift in the wiring of your brain. You'll learn that acting out doesn't give you the chance of connecting as you'd hoped for it to do. 

Ultimately our negative actions are all connected to positive needs. Negative acting out is not to push people away but typically to connect. The negative behaviour can be carried out in order to feel more significant, to regain a sense of pride. The acting our is goal oriented and the behaviour is all a choice by you. You choose how to breath in the situation, what inner dialogue you keep and how you move and you decide the tone of your own voice, while your 'acting out'. 

All of these choices are made by you, in order to achieve a goal. The goal can be a better connection and the driving motivational factor can be fear. It can also be other combinations of goal and motivation, but the typical situation is a person that is not feeling like their needs are being met and therefor is acting in certain ways to get to that goal, whatever that may be. 

For this reason, the mentor tries to correct the faulted behaviour and to wire the brain of the person in a new way, in order to help the person chose better behaviour that will ultimately give the person better results and help achieve the goals that they are after."
mentors,feqqdi6,t3_eq70ov,1579344861.0,"You need to get out there and try these things before you can decide if it's something you're motivated by and would like to pursue further.

After this I started working in a place where I gave broad legal advise and was involved in processes and workshops etc., as well. My new job involves hiring international researchers and finally I feel like I'm 'home' in my career. I would not have ended up here, if I hadn't tried to carve out a path for myself.

lifecoaching,fedrib8,t3_ej1cwz,1579018330.0,"Although there are several possibilities, I'm suspecting that the reason behind her behaviour is part conditioning and part the paradox between having a need for feeling significant (self-care) and connection (be part of something, helping and pleasing others). 

She might have been conditioned into serving others, before herself. 

She might also find that when she tries to meet the need for feeling signifiant, by taking care of her own needs, she has to chose that over connection, which might feel like a loss to her, or a very egoistic deed, that'll bring negative effects to her life, in the end. 

She might benefit from being told to commit to the need of feeling significant and really work through all the emotions that come with it. Have her write down the questions that pop up 'Am I an egoistic person? Will they abandon me when they find out that I sometimes chose myself over them?' etc."

AskReddit,fed7wcg,t1_febrgrf,1579002953.0,Maybe there's too much certainty in your life and you need more variety in order to meet the need of feeling significant. You did meet the need for connection by commenting though.
AskReddit,fed7uat,t1_febprt5,1579002885.0,"Okay. Thanks for sharing. This might be due to a need for certainty. Some people will even hold on to their own depression, in order to make sure that they can predict the next thing happening. The figure that if they don't have variety in their life, such as letting go of their depressive thoughts, then they won't be caught off guard. This way, even negative actions are performed, in order to meet personal needs. By commenting on this thread, you got another need met as well, and that is the need for connection and to be a part of something. If you look into the different types of needs that a person has, you'll be able to answer the question more precisely, such as: 'I wan't to feel significant and therefor I am driven towards my goals, but I'm bad at switching from achievement-mode into connection-mode and so I have bad social experiences' etc."
