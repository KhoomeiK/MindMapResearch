Many movies that are sequels or adaptations of sequels benifut from contex of the source material, but are by no means a prerequisite, Lord of the Rings can be enjoyed with out having read the Hobbit.

I think what is most impressive about carell what he did in Foxcatcher. The ability to expertly portray a dramatic character with zero grounding in the style of acting he is most associated with.

This becomes more apparent when you compare him to other comedic actors in critically acclaimed dramatic roles. Take Jim Carrey, Bill Murray, and Robin Williams.

Each of their most acclaimed dramatic roles, are roles that in some sense allowed them to still ground the character in comedy, or balance the comedic nature of there acting styles with the drama of the film. Murray in _lost in translation_, Williams in _Good Will Hunting_, and Carrey in _enternal sunshine of the spotless mind_.

Carell most acclaimed role, DuPont in Foxcatcher, is a terrifyingly manic role with zero comedic value or presence. He knocked it out of the park.

This style of character is something that we saw from previous actors such as Carry in _The number 23_ or Williams in _One Hour Photo_. While you can say they performed the roles adequately, neither of those roles are considered the respective actors strongest performance, and neither came remotely close to showing the extreme end of the acting range that Carell did."

Space Force is taking all the space related service members and missions and putting it into one branch. 

Most importantly it will elemanate the headache that comes with previous joint coordination. So it was the case that you had 3 units, say an Army, Navy, and Airforce units, that all did separate jobs that overlapped and may even be dependent on one another. They each have varying priorities that are determined by their respective branch of the military. They independently handle acquisition prioritize (even though it may effect the other branches).

Marines use the equipment that suits their fighting doctrine. For example the use of M16s and Acogs, the new m27, etc. The Army is not putting optics on every rifle.

HumansBeingBros,fczquyu,t3_ejn5yf,1578107050.0,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

todayilearned,fcl6a15,t1_fckvgee,1577740722.0,"Exactly. In shooting we call that “grouping”. It’s much better to have a tight grouping off of the bullseye than a wide grouping in the center of it.

Why you ask?

Everyone of us physically different. Eye dominance, head shape, length of your arms, the height of your cheekbones. All these things make it so  when you look down a rifles sights and put them on a target, where you think you are aiming and where the actual barrel is pointed, are slightly different.

Because of this you can zero a weapons sights. Zeroing is the process of moving the angle of the sights (And how they line up on the target) so theY perfectly line up with where YOUR grouping actually lands. 

Essentially you aim at a bullseye, shoot until you find out where your bullets are landing Then move the sights until the bullets start landing In the bullseye (YOU aim at the same spot every time)

As far as we have seen, it serves him just fine. Fury put on a boxing clinic against him. For 10 out of 12 rounds He was exposed, embarrassed, and clowned with . then Wilder he lands the right hand and reminds us all that at the end of the day that’s all you need to do.

I’m just saying it’s wrong to compare him to a hybrid threat like Tyson. Tyson was a boxer, who in his prime (this part is important) seemed like there wasn’t a technical solution to. People Who tried to Keep distance and slug with him got put to sleep either trading or underestimating his closing speed. Guys tried to play defense counter boxing and got swarmed. Guys tried to keep him smothered up and he folded them in half before sending their heads into obit with his uppercut.

Other then Tyson being Tysons greatest weakness, The “road map” to beat Mike wasn’t avoiding one particular thing throughout the fight, it was surviving the early rounds. I’d actually say that Wilder could be more dangerous in that regard
