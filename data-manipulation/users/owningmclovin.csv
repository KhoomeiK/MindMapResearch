I believe that something short by Stephen King and JK Rowlings Harry Potter series will feature in 300 years not just because they are popular but because of the way the books became a part of the english speaking culture. 

Harry Potter was not the first Series Book in YA literature but it was the earliest most popular and after that series tons of YA books have given young readers multi book stories instead of one offs or episodic books like Nancy Drew.

WritingPrompts,feaa9e7,t3_eo6wel,1578946214.0,"It was the fresh air that woke him. When he opened his eyes, he saw the sky above him through shattered glass.

“Computer, Diagnostic.” He commanded, and reports scrolled across the implant in his left eye. He was uninjured, his suit was depressurized (Obviously), his helmet was offline due to impact, the atmosphere was almost the same pressure and mixture as earth. It could have been much worse.

He fumbled with the latches on the helmet, it was hard with the gloves on but he managed. As he lifted it over his head, bits of glass showered his hair. He closed his eyes leaned over, trying to get it all out without touching the sharp edges.

Nix got his first real look at this new planet only after he was sure all the glass had fallen out. There was hard rock under his hands and knees, it was full of small holes so he guessed it might be volcanic. This did not mean much as he knew Alpha Zed was riddled with active and dormant volcanos.

The section of rock he had fallen into was barren Nix saw trees not more than 100 meters in any direction. Unmistakably he saw palm trees, but there were other taller trees mix in and the more he looked the more he saw. By the look of it, he smashed right into the only bare rock in a rain forest.

“Computer, Location”

POSITION SYSTEMS OFFLINE flashed across his left eye.

“Great.”

It was more difficult getting to his feet than he expected, the volcanic rock was peppered with small hand holds but he had trouble finding a flat place to stand. In the end Nix decide to crawl to the nearest trees. At least there he would be able to grab hold of something for balance.

It was slow work. The rock face was sloped enough that moving to a higher or lower spot would feel more like climbing than crawling. Instead he inched slowly to one side, remembering his training to maintain 3 points of contact as he moved around the rock face.

When he was no more than 10 meters from the first tree, a voice called out.

Nix looked up and saw a man standing on the sloping rocks as casually as Nix would have sat in a chair. The man was tall, with a thick beard and broad shoulders. He held one hand palm out to Nix, the other held a sword.

The man shouted, practically barked more unintelligible words at Nix. The words meant nothing but the body language was clear. Nix dropped his knees to the rock and slowly held his hands up to show they were empty. Not like it mattered much, the red nylon suit covered every inch but his head, and Nix knew damn well this was an uncontacted planet. He must look like a monster to this man, and he had no way to communicate with him.

“Computer, translate,” Nix whispered.

UNDOCUMENTED LANGUAGE

“Computer, begin passive learning”

There was a low whistle to Nix’s left, several people men and women all armed with blades were coming towards him. A look to the right showed the same.  Down the rock face, Nix saw figured moving amongst the trees. He was surrounded.

The first man, who was clearly some sort of leader, did not try to hurt Nix after all. He seemed to realize that if Nix spoke any language, he certainly could not communicate and he seemed to take that in stride. They led Nix to the bottom of the volcano, which was painfully slow. The natives all walked easily on the uneven rock but Nix could not stand on two feet. He crawled, like a toddler while the others walked easily. After a while some of the younger men and women began to do cruel but accurate impressions of his unsteady crawl. This resulted in laughter and sideways looks at Nix.

At the bottom of the volcano, the ground was mostly flat, but it was also soft and the boots in his suit were more apt to sink than walk. When they finally reached wherever the big man was leading them, Nix was exhausted, but the others were restless and clearly bored.

A very old woman, dressed in bright cloth which was more of a wrap than a dress, waited for the group on the edge of what was unmistakably a village. Nix was stuck by how much the buildings inside reminded him of the villages in his favorite fantasy games.  A single large building, not quite a castle, more like a very tall house, stood in the middle of the village, it was surrounded by many smaller cottages. Of course, Nix had seen images from uncontacted humanoids but this was the first time he was really struck by how near to his own civilization this world had progressed.

The old woman, instantly Nix thought of her as Mother, though he would not have known why, walked up to him and embraced him. Here in front of all the village, she hugged a stranger first. Nix hugged her back.

Mother, for that was who see was in his mind, held his shoulders and pushed him back for a better look. Then she held his chin and moved his head around as though making sure it worked properly.  She turned around, where a crowd had gathered and shouted something to the villagers.

They cheered.

Mother and the bearded man lead him through the village to the big house. The place had wooden double doors, when they were opened Nix estimated the doorway was 8 meters wide and as much as 10 meters tall. Inside, huge pillars, with intricate cravings held up a roof that seemed impossibly high for their level of technology. An open space in the center was surrounded by many long tables with a single high table at the back of the room. This was a mead hall. Nix almost laughed.

Mother lead Nix to the head table, where she gestured to a chair, just to the right of center.

Unsure of what to do, Nix looked at Mother until she sat in the center seat, then patted the seat of the chair she wanted him to sit in.

The crowd had pilled in by now and they were all taking seats at the tables or disappearing into side doors Nix had not noticed.

When most everyone was seated, Mother stood and shouted over the rumble. Everyone stopped speaking at once. Mother spoke, in what may as well have been grunts as far as Nix could tell, for several minutes, with the villagers hanging on her every word.

Nix sat, trying to take it all in, but left firmly in the dark until words began to scroll across his left eye.

“SKY MAN, FROM THE FIRE MOUNTAIN” BEST APPROXIMATION.

Nix may not know what they were saying, but the computer was attempting the translation on its own."

Not sure about a sequel but I think the short story would have benefited from real scenes in between the meeting of the first woman and the actual murder. We never meet TOO SMART until the end except from the narators recap and I think that a good place to improve. 

What do you think I could have done better?"

\*

I dropped all other pursuits. STALKER and TOO SMART were now the only ones that mattered. A simple background check confirmed what I already knew about STALKER, she already had 3 restraining orders and her credit score was in the 400s, and she had a registered .38 but no concealed weapons permit. After 10 days she had not seemed to notice her gun was missing.  

I kept seeing TOO SMART playing them both right up until the night I knew would come, the night when STALKER followed me somewhere. 

\*

She was not good at it. She followed me out of the office and to the little store on the same block where I had lunch, then back to my office. When I left, she was following me again. So I texted TOO SMART for a drink. 

STALKER didn’t follow me inside. But she did follow me all the way to TOO SMART’s apartment. I never looked back. I knew she was there. 

\*

TOO SMART had those little puff chairs, that look more like bean bags than real furniture. We sat next to each other sharing a bottle of wine as we talked. We had talked a lot since we met. I am good at talking, the trick is, let them say what they want, then ask them about it. Everything I shared with her was a lie of course, but I told the same lies so often I never lost track. 

As the wine took effect I told her I wanted to try something. 

“Give me both you hands and close your eyes.”

She giggled but complied. 

“What are we doing.”

“Shhhh, I don’t think it will work if we talk.”

I pulled the box with my mind, I put it between us, then I pushed it into her hands. 

“Open”

She looked confused, the horrified. 

“What?” I asked innocently.

“What the hell is this?” She was on her feet now. “Is this some kind of joke.”

TOO SMART was now glowing on her forehead. 

“What? I asked.

“You’ve written KILLER on your head. What is going on? It doesn’t feel right, Ryan what did you do.”

Just then there was a knock on the door. Then a pounding. I ran down the hall and flung it open. STALKER was there, just as I knew she would be. 

“Cheater.” She was crying

“What? No this is my sister’s place.” The lie came quickly because I was ready for it, “Come meet her.”

We found TOO SMART on the sofa now. She was dazed, but when she saw me walk in TOO SMART changed to, SHE KNOWS and it was glowing more than anything. It was practically burning the letters into my eyes. 

“You’re a murder.” TOO SMART/ SHE KNOWS said coldly.

I pulled the .38 out of my pocket and shot her. Twice. 

“You killed her!” I yelled for all to hear, “Oh, GOD, OH NO, YOU KILLED HER YOU KILLED HER.”

Then I leapt on STALKER and finished the job. 

\*

It was two the price of one that night. I never had anything like it. Sure, I spent the night at the police station, but it was open and shut. A known stalker followed an EX to the new girls house and murdered her. Then the EX had to defend himself, she had a gun after all. I  know I can never do it the same way twice, but this new power is something amazing. It is so easy to find someone to tick all the boxes now that I can see it on there face."

STALKER

It was right in the middle of her forehead. 

I thought it was a joke at first, like maybe she passed out drunk and some tool wrote it on her in Sharpie. But that couldn’t be right, there was something off about the handwriting, it was, too familiar. I could see her from the bar, but she hadn’t seen me yet. I decided then and there, I would not mention it. 

She was exactly the woman I expected. Her pic was certainly her and it was no old photo either. She was even wearing the same jacket. I should know, I had been looking at her profile just a few minutes ago. 

I stood up and waved, she saw me and smiled. I look like my pic too. They like that. I work out every day because I know that’s what they want to see, I don’t need to practice smiling anymore but I do make sure every hair is in the right place and my face it just the right amount of scruffy. They like that too. 

“Kate.” It was a statement not a question. I got to my feet, very respectful of me, and held out my hand to shake, not too familiar, we have only been texting four days after all. 

“Hi, Ryan,” she had to look up to look me in the eye. They like that too. 

“I have two seats here,” I pointed to the one next to mine, “So we can get a drink, or we can see if they have a table.”

“I could do the bar.” And she sat down, “what are you having.’

There was a half full glass of ice water in front of me, just so she would know I wasn’t a heavy drinker, I grabbed a bar menu and opened between us so we could both take a look. Pouring over the menu, our heads nearly touching but not quite, not too close, never too close, just enough to make sure everyone in the bar knew we were together. 

“I’ll have this.” She pointed to a white sangria. 

“Excellent. I know what I’m getting too.”

I looked for the bar tender and he was already walking towards me. It wasn’t very busy and I had been taking up two seats just for a water after all. He looked a little peeved but that changed when I ordered our drinks. My glass of wine cost almost double what her signature cocktail cost. I wonder if she was going to try checking how much I spent.   
 

Sure enough, when I looked over, her eyes were on the menu, STALKER still very visible on her forehead. 

Suddenly it hit me why the writing was familiar. It was my own. This didn’t make any sense of course. I have never seen this woman in person before and I don’t think I ever wrote on anyone’s head. 

“So I know you are a nurse of some kind, but what kind of place do you work at again.” I asked knowing full well the that the children’s hospital was practically on every page of her social media. 

As she launched into a lecture about the wonderful work she was doing, and how she does it for the kids, even when it is so hard sometimes, only half listened while pretending to make eye contact. 

The more I looked at STALKER, the more it fit in my mind. I could feel it, not the way I could feel when someone was like me, but almost like a physical box. Mentally, I tried to push the box up. STALKER became smaller and rose to the top of her forehead, new words appeared below STALKER, a little smaller than the first. 

FISCALLY IRRISPONSIBLE was now right above her eyebrows. 

The idea that I had finally gone completely insane instead of my normal brand of crazy crossed my mind but even though I readily admit that I am not like most other humans, I still think I am of sound mind. For the time at least I want to see how this plays out. The most important thing tonight, just became a second date.  

I played everything else exactly normal for a few hours. We had one more drink each, then grabbed a table for some food. 

She was holding my hand when we walked out together and she almost whispered “How far is your place.” 

STALKER seemed to glow. I smiled. 

\*

Once inside my Apartment, I lead her to the kitchen, giving her a tour and letting her take in my place. It was all about creating a positive environment. I have learned that if the place is too well put together it looks fake. Instead, it is mostly clean, the floors are spotless and especially the bathroom is tidy, but there are clothes toss on chairs and a couple plates in the sink. 

“I’m sorry about the mess,” I lied, “Can I get you something?”

“I don’t know, what are you having?”

I produced a bottle of wine, not wildly expensive but something she could never think of as cheap. She said that would be great. Then asked to use the bathroom. 

It took only a moment to pour 2 glasses. Then I looked opened her purse. It held the usual crap, make up, some meds, a wallet, keys, a handful of receipts and at the bottom, a little .38 revolver. The thing had a pink grip. I placed it on top of my fridge, far out of her sight. Then I fiddled with the blue tooth speakers, just in time to start playing music as she came out of the bathroom. 

The rest of the evening went exactly like I thought. Only when she left the next day. I had a lot more to think about than usual. 

\*

I met her 3 more times. Each time, I pushed that little box that said STALKER a little further until I had a list of all her flaws. 

During the same week, I met a few other women around the city.  3 were dates I set up through the app and to my surprise, they too had little words written on their foreheads in my writing. The last one was more interesting. When we started talking, he had nothing on her head, much the same way the waitress had nothing, but the more we talked, the more she opened up to me, the more I could feel a box start to form. When it finally felt whole, I looked right above her eyes and saw TOO SMART.

I made sure to get her number

\* 

I spent almost a week deciding what to do next. The pleasures that had once been my major focus now seemed trivial. This new thing, these boxes, were like toys I couldn’t put down. I just could not figure out how to play with them. 

One morning I woke up and the plan was a solid in my mind as any of the boxes."

Another poster linked the sears home catalog from the same time period where the cheapest was $452 and the most expensive was $2,906 or  $12,775.61-$82,136.97 in today's money. Now that does not include the land, but you can't buy a new trailer for 12,775.61 and whats more the trailer would be smaller (bad) but also with central air, modern wiring and modernish cooking appliances.

Take going to the doctor for example, 50 years ago if a 60 year old man when to the doctor with leg pain the doc would probably give him a cane, tell him he is getting old and charge him $15. Now that visit might cost over $200 but instead of a cane the 60 year old might walk out with a list of specific PT exercises that the doc 50 years ago wouldn't have know about and  possibly might see an improvement in his life."

I think they will, inevitably turn to violence, and when they do, I fear what China will do in response. China will not want to look weak. No government wants to lose. The one party will not willingly concede another's power. 

Other nations may be willing to support HK but the age of colonialism has ended. HK will have to decide it's own fate and a I fear a lot of people will die by violence precisely because China will not allow democracy with checks and balances."
