every other game loves my ram with X.M.P on idrk.  


would be awesome to know if GGG is aware of these issues or if theres something else going on"

aww,ffra3an,t1_ffr3kyu,1580153742.0,You keep rewording things as if it changes the context. Whether or not foxes can be dangerous is not a matter of your opinion.
aww,ffr0tz9,t1_ffr0gy7,1580147973.0,It’s obvious you know nothing of foxes that was my point.
aww,ffqzxz2,t1_ffqx15s,1580147413.0,"Do you have any personal first hand experience at all with foxes? 

I know the answer is no because of your comment."
classicwow,ffqykcf,t1_ffqmxgf,1580146538.0,Funnily enough this would probably be one of the only ways to get them to address it. Some large organized botting in protest. But you’d need a big group of people on board or a bunch of the big guilds or something.

Definitely a market for a company to build its reputation on consistent good quality devices, would gobble up the competition."

That's essentially the rough idea of a Path of Exile league. Definitely feel like it could apply to a classic server, and keep people playing."

Aww Defensive boy's true colors show.   


You coulda just acknowledged this in a calm way from the getgo; ""oh guess i remembered it wrong, maybe ill give it another try""   


Instead you want to try to get in the last point like everyone else is being ridiculous when the reality is you keep making shit up and then act like surprised pikachu when you're called out on it"
worldnews,fe6mke8,t1_fe6mc1n,1578896040.0,"Forgetting is one thing, 'few episodes / broken show that doesn't work'   
is intentionally misleading. You state 2 comments later 

> bout 5 minutes was all I could stand and I moved on. 

Atleast keep your story straight, stop lying and deceiving if you dont want to be associated with sinister undertones"
worldnews,fe6ma4j,t1_fe6m3q3,1578895728.0,"Thats fine. My only issue is you stating;

Its like intentionally misleading for no reason, and is just you making stuff up to contribute?"
worldnews,fe6lywq,t1_fe6lt37,1578895398.0,"Its hilarious that you felt that way because its literally the point of the episode, you felt all the right emotions just couldn't sit through them shitting on the character you hated. 

The show doesn't work without the group's dynamic, when dennis shows up they realize it and return to their former glory essentially forcing the chick out"
worldnews,fe6lod4,t1_fe6lh1k,1578895089.0,"You legitimately didn't finish the episode then; he comes back and takes back over its almost like the entire episode was a grand re-entrance for Dennis. Also you specifically pretended to have watched a few episodes   


> But seeing a few episodes without him was just awkward. The gang is literally all required for me or it's just a broken show that doesn't work :( 

This is a blatant lie what are you trying to provide to this comment chain, you are no true fan of the golden god, begone heathen."
worldnews,fe6l2b6,t1_fe6kynm,1578894459.0,Did you ever actually watch? Because he 'leaves' at the end of a season and 'returns' episode 1 of the following season.  maybe the first half to 3/4 of the episode is no Dennis even though he's still heavily a part of the plot.

politics,fcym2yk,t1_fcy6pn9,1578082526.0,"This isn’t central to “Catholics” it’s probably part of the problem with all groups but why were you ‘raised catholic’ but never learned about these other people all talking about the same people in the same small area being so similar? Instead all we can see is “oh that turban on your head is weird” “oh that cross on your necklace is weird” “oh that cap on your head is weird” 

I think we need to all take responsibility and learn about our neighbors just diversity in the same space isn’t really achieving much if we can’t work in tandem."
politics,fcy5yxd,t1_fcxcen0,1578075273.0,The crazy part is everyone’s freaking out over the ‘same’ god (abrahamic origin; like Christians or Muslims up in arms over “God/Allah” its legitimately derived from the same traditions and culture and is each languages respective way to refer to “god”.

It’s fine if you feel like you can only look out for yourself and family but if the entire human race as you put it thought the way you did it’s immeasurable how far behind we would be, and whether or not we would even have a society to debate about."
