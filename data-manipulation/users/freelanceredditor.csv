SandersForPresident,fgwbz38,t1_fgvbhr5,1581159341.0,I don’t know anyone who passed grade 2 and don’t understand what a billion or a trillion is.

Showerthoughts,fgt9h08,t1_fgsovep,1581101314.0,"Never understood this sentence. It doesn’t work without a coma or “that” or “which.”
It’s like saying 

Denver cats Chicago dogs bully bully New York rats. 

Where this is the correct way of saying it: 

Denver cats that Chicago dogs bully, bully New York rats."

relationship_advice,fgsqde1,t3_f0bjqa,1581090408.0,My husband is in a bad mood all the time. I love him so I tolerate the attitude and just chalk it up to his collection of mental and physical Illnesses. His neutral self is an unsatisfied and demanding person.  It’s rare extremely rare that he’s in a good mood. The only times he’s nice to me is when he wants something from me. I love him so I tolerate it. And when he starts complaining or yelling I just think of the rare good times we have together that helps. But it’s difficult to not have deep resentments. Good luck

memes,fgsp1p4,t3_f0994q,1581089581.0,"This is my husbands life yet he fucking hates me and thinks I’m a monster because he did groceries by himself once, his reasoning was for me to have a bit time to keep slaving away to generate money and instead I used that time to relax a bit after already working for  8 hours and visiting my demented dad for 2 -3 hours. And he fucking lost it at me for 3 hours straight. Saying he did the groceries so I had time to work and I’m wasting it. Fuck. 
I fucking hate life"
todayilearned,fgs568k,t1_fgrwlrx,1581072137.0,"I’m not saying that she doesn’t deserve defence. I just think if there’s so much evidence against her and it’s so clearly obvious then the defence lawyer should have a duty to tell the truth and not concoct a lie to let a child murdered roam free on this planet. The just thing would be for her to get treated humanely and not get the death sentence. And that should be what the lawyer fights for. 
But I understand that the law is flawless on paper and extremely flawed in practice."
todayilearned,fgrt6ka,t1_fgriou5,1581056680.0,Do you think the lawyer was convinced that she was innocent or do you think he did it just to win it
