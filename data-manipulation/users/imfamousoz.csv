I can't express how exciting it is to see people enjoying this game so many years. Yes, it was VERY different when I was a kid. Look up the original pictures sometime, it's amazing how much they've changed. I remember back in the day when the original developers had their faces on things throughout the website, and bottled faeries were a coveted item. My play years are older than tombola and I look back on them fondly."

Often (not always!) Ordinary parents venting will name an unlikely scenario with loose details, like tossing baby out a window. Whereas abusers are more detailed and realistic with their ""venting"", like smashing fingers."

My 6 month old son is a master at throwing pacifiers so I grabbed a spare pack at the store the other day.

This is a reoccurring talk. A boy once told her she wasn't allowed to like Iron Man because she's a girl. Another time, she wore a solid grey sweater to school and a girl on the bus told her she was gross for wearing boy clothes. It drives me nuts."
