AskReddit,fdeij4t,t1_fdei3bh,1578339762.0,I totally appreciate deeper character development. I just cringe a little when it's just an obvious plot device that's never referenced again and quickly abandoned before the next episode. If they consistently go back to expand on a previously established back story I have no issues with that whatsoever.
AskReddit,fdeah2h,t3_ekvj2i,1578334752.0,"Creating a character trait or back-story as a convenient plot point to make the plot happen in one single episode but then never referring to it again, or even sometimes contradicting it later in the series.

for example all the main characters start referring to their ""regular"" bowling night out of the blue at the beginning of an episode even though they never showed an interest in bowling or even hanging out socially together. Later in the episode all the characters are at the bowling alley at the same time so something integral to the plot can happen. Then bowling is quickly forgotten and never referred to again. Later in the series there will be another ""regular"" activity to make another convenient plot point occur. 

I find it so lame and obvious. Like the writer couldn't think of a more natural way (according to established character traits and back-stories) for all or some of the characters to be together at the same time."

AskReddit,fcl5z8b,t3_ehrhaz,1577740537.0,"Growing up in LA it was not unusual to have to take a car everywhere, and that trip was always a minimum of 20 minutes and usually much longer. Time and distances become warped when you grow up in an environment like that. 

I'll think nothing of driving 20 minutes to eat at a good restaurant but I have friends who grew up in East Coast cities, or large European cities and to them any trip requiring a car is considered inconvenient, and any car trip over 20 minutes seems excessive to the point they really have to question if the trip is even worth it."
