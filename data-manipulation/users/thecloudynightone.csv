wholesomememes,febummd,t1_febt8ur,1578962911.0,"Like I said, I'm not defending it. Being harassed was, I'm sure, awful for you, and the people doubting the validity of your experience are assholes. If anything, we definitely should be believing women's stories of harassment more often. 

Men who say they're legitimately worried about women calling the cops on them just for saying hello are either dicks, suffer from some kind of anxiety disorder, or never talk to irl women. I happen to be all three, personally."

wholesomememes,febrvj3,t1_febn23r,1578961942.0,"the point is that the guy is catastrophizing. he might consciously know that the odds are low that any given woman he interacts with will call the cops on him just for saying hi, but it's the worst thing that could possibly happen, and he's irrationally fearful that it would happen to him because he sees himself as the kind of person who can never catch a break. 

I'm not defending it, but this is something a lot of men are prone to doing, admittedly even I do this at times even though I know it's bullshit"

AsianParentStories,feb3lsa,t3_eob5my,1578955123.0,never have I heard anyone else describe their parents so similarly to mine. they make me feel worthless in a myriad of ways but at the same time I feel completely invalid in saying anything bad about them because they still provide for material needs
MutualSupport,fe9kq99,t1_fe938wz,1578938704.0,"yeah my personal life ain't doing too hot either. the people around me are sick of me. I don't want to think about my own life, it doesn't mean anything anyways. I want to devote my life to something that means more than me, to the revolution. but that revolution doesn't look like it's ever coming. either I'm weak in my faith or I invested my entire identity into something that won't ever come. I don't know which one would hurt more."

As for friends, none of them want to talk to me anymore because all I talk about is how much I hate myself and how depressed I am. I don't want to do that, I go into conversations trying to talk about normal things but I'm just so sad that I can't stop it from consuming all my thoughts"
