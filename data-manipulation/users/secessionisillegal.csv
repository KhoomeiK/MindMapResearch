PoliticalHumor,fenavov,t1_fen1aya,1579280747.0,"You made the claim in your initial post that the founding fathers ""predominantly wanted the split from the British Empire because the empire was getting close to abolishing slavery."" That's not at all true. It was true for some, but the exact opposite was true for others (they were pissed because the British Empire was preventing them from abolishing slavery) and it's a mistake to view the Thirteen Colonies as one unified entity at that point, as the United States that it ultimately became.

Half the states used the Revolutionary War as their means of abolishing slavery. Vermont split off from New York in 1777, specifically citing their desire to abolish slavery as one of the reasons for doing it. Massachusetts abolished slavery by court order in 1783. New Hampshire did it in their state constitution the same year, though there may have still been some enslaved people ""grandfathered in"" for some time after. The other Northern states had all enacted ""gradual emancipation"" laws by 1804: Pennsylvania in 1780, Connecticut and Rhode Island both in 1784, New York in 1799, and New Jersey in 1804.

At the same time, the Southern states went the opposite direction. Laws there took even more rights away from enslaved people, who practically had no rights at all as it was.

Abolitionist David Cooper wrote *A Serious Address to the Rulers of America* in 1783, in response to the ""all men are created equal"" phrase in the Declaration of Independence, and his sentiment was shared by many Northern people:

> ""If these solemn truths [in the Declaration of Independence, e.g., ""that all men are created equal""], uttered at such an awful crisis, are self-evident: unless we can shew that the African race are not men, words can hardly express the amazement which naturally arises on reflecting, that the very people who make these pompous declarations are slave-holders, and, by their legislative, tell us, that these blessings were only meant to be the rights of white men, not of all men: and would seem to verify the observation of an eminent writer; “When men talk of liberty, they mean their own liberty, and seldom suffer their thoughts on that point to stray to their neighbours.”""

Northerners were on board with Cooper's thinking. In 1790, in his last political act before his death, Benjamin Franklin petitioned U.S. Congress on behalf of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society that he was president of to get Congress to consider abolishing slavery across the country. Despite the wording in the U.S. Constitution, the PAS lobbied to say that it was in Congress's power to abolish slavery in all the states. There was debate on the petition on the U.S. House floor, and the Southern representatives were pissed that it was even being debated. Rep. Thomas Tudor Tucker of South Carolina said:

> ""Do these men expect a general emancipation of slaves by law? This would never be submitted to by the Southern States without a civil war.""

Rep. William Loughton Smith of South Carolina basically said that the South would never have agreed to the U.S. Constitution if they thought it would ever allow the federal government to abolish slavery in their states:

> ""When we entered into this confederacy, we did it from political, not from moral motives, and I do not think my constituents want to learn morals from the petitioners; I do not believe they want improvement in their moral system; if they do, they can get it at home.
>
> ""The gentleman from Georgia has justly stated the jealousy of Southern States. On entering this Government, they apprehend that the other States, not knowing the necessity the citizens of the Southern States were under to hold this species of property, would, from motives of humanity and benevolence, be led to vote for a general emancipation; and had they not seen that the constitution provided against the effect of such a disposition, I may be bold to say they never would have adopted it. And, notwithstanding all the calmness which some gentlemen have viewed the subject, they will find that this discussion alone will create great alarm....We look upon this measure as an attack upon the palladium of the property of our country; it is therefore our duty to oppose it by every means in our power.""

Clearly, and historically, there were very different views from the two sections of the country on the future of slavery from the time of the Revolution and then Constitution on. 

I have no problem with anything else you said, just the characterization that they were all of one mind about the British Empire's approach to slavery is wrong. Again, as you wrote, which is what I'm disputing:

> The founding fathers were capitalists who predominantly wanted the split from the British Empire because the empire was getting close to abolishing slavery. 

This is true about half of the states, and not true about the other. It's unfair to label either side as ""predominant"" since the issue so severely split the country in two, even at the time of the Constitutional Convention. 

Massachusetts had, in fact, passed a law in 1766 to abolish slavery, a law proposed by legislator James Otis, Sr. But the royally-appointed governor Thomas Hutchison vetoed it. The Massachusetts legislature passed it again, and again it was vetoed by the un-elected British governor of the colony. 

With the *Somerset* ruling in Britain in 1773 that effectively abolished slavery in England, the Massachusetts abolitionists decided to try a different approach to get abolition enacted in the colony. They filed a lawsuit to get *Somerset* applied in their colony, but the British courts ruled that *Somerset* only applied to England specifically, not to any of Great Britain's colonies. The abolitionists were pissed, and this was one of the reasons that Massachusetts revolted--both the British courts and British governor had denied the will of the people to enact abolition. It wasn't the top reason for revolting, but it was a big one. After all, the issue was big enough that Vermont would declare its independence from New York in 1777 over their desire to end slavery.

And Pennsylvania was on the verge of the same. As Benjamin Franklin had written already in 1770, when a British writer accused all Americans of supporting slavery, Franklin wrote in response:

> ""Many Thousands there [in North America] abhor the Slave Trade...[and] conscientiously avoid being concerned with it, and do every Thing in their Power to abolish it.""

Of course, the slave-owning class in the South was very supportive of the Revolution for the reasons you cited, that it would allow them to continue slavery without fear of abolition by the British government. There's no question. But again, my point is that the Northern states were supportive for the exact opposite reason when it came to the slavery issue. With the British government having been taking active measures to *prevent* the colonies from abolishing slavery, the Northern abolitionists saw a revolution as a way to finally get abolition enacted without interference from British courts or vetoes of royal governors. Within 21 years of the end of the war, every single one of the Northern states had either abolished slavery immediately, or passed a law that phased it out in the near future (well, New Jersey elongated the timeline, but they still did emancipate all enslaved people there). 

In 1787, when Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance that created the plan of carving out the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, Northern politicians successfully made sure that these new states would be free states, and slavery was outlawed there from the get-go. 

Again, clearly, there were two minds on the slavery issue, and two very different (and opposite) motivations in regards to slavery when the Thirteen Colonies joined together for the revolution. The U.S. Constitution was initially drafted the way it was precisely so that the North could move forward with abolition, while the South could keep slavery. The hope was one side could eventually convince the other to go their way (likely the North convincing the South to abolish slavery), but even at the outset, there were fears it was never going to happen except through war. Despite compromises made as time went by, those premonitions came true. In any case, it's wrong to look at the motivations of the Thirteen Colonies, even among the aristocratic capitalists, as all being of one mind on the slavery issue when they had very different outlooks on it."
PoliticalHumor,fembia0,t1_felhrlk,1579247274.0,"Even this isn't true. Only some of the colonies were upset about taxes, particularly Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and a few more that actually had it in their state constitutions (""colonial charters"") that taxes couldn't be raised on them except if the state (colonial) legislature agreed to it, which they had not. They tried to get all the colonies on board with the issue with the Albany Congress of 1754, but the best they could do was get 7 of 13 on board.

By the time the actual Revolution broke out more than twenty years later, the issues were very different. They were mostly to do with the ""Intolerable Acts"" but the Declaration of Independence mentions many more grievances beyond those. They listed 27 grievances, and only one of them had to do with taxes. A few others could be argued to have to do indirectly to do with taxes, but even in the best case scenario, it's maybe three or four while the more major issues were the other 23 or so that had to do with other issues. More generally, the crown was overstepping their authority, and the colonists aimed to put a stop to it. Taxes were more a symptom of this overstepping, not the cause particularly. Just one of the more obvious early examples of this overstepping their authority."
PoliticalHumor,femb1kw,t1_felqpxv,1579246685.0,"This is not at all the case. There were thirteen colonies, and all thirteen had different motivations for joining the revolution.

Your statement does apply to Vermont (""the 14th colony""), and to some extent Massachusetts. But even in Massachusetts, the bigger issues were still the acts of Parliament that effectively closed dissolved their government (""the Massachusetts Government Act""), that closed down their commerce (""the Boston Port Act""), and that gave immunity to British soldiers from breaking Massachusetts laws (""the Administration of Justice Act"" and ""Quartering Act""). There were other issues, such as the crown's efforts to stop Massachusetts from banning slavery, as well as the tax issue, that led to the Revolution, but they weren't the major issues at the time.

And in the South, they weren't issues at all. In fact, it was the threat of the opposite. The major issue was the Quebec Act which forbade Virginia from expanding into the Western territory. But they were also pissed about the Somerset court ruling, that they feared was going to thrust abolition upon them against their will.

Characterizing the thirteen colonies all of one mind isn't really accurate. They joined the Revolution for very different, local reasons, and sometimes those reasons were very opposite from one another, slavery being the most notable such reason."

history,fcm0sjx,t1_fclykvy,1577761260.0,"Eh, I think Buchanan gets a slightly bum wrap. From the moment Lincoln was elected, and especially after secession, South Carolina said that they would take any federal action at Fort Sumter or anywhere else within their borders as an act of war. Buchanan vocally called secession illegal, but he didn't want to risk seeing if South Carolina was bluffing and start the war. We wanted to give Lincoln a chance at keeping the peace. There were a series of efforts to avoid the war during the ""Secession Winter"", all of which Buchanan supported. The Crittenden Compromise began debates in Congress within days of South Carolina's secession, which was followed by the Peace Conference of 1861 organized in January and held through most of February, which was followed by the proposal of the Corwin Amendment at the end of February. Debates and voted on the Corwin Amendment continued in the last weeks of Buchanan's presidency, and it was ultimately ratified by both houses of Congress just 48 hours before Buchanan left office. It just had to be ratified by enough states to go into effect. For all Buchanan knew, this compromise was actually going to work and prevent a war, and the worst thing he could do was mobilize troops into the South and start a war so that the compromise was never given a chance to succeed.

People do say that if the federal response had been swift and severe, then the South would never have been able to organize and fight a four-year long war, but I think that's unrealistic. The U.S. Armed Forces were pretty tiny at the time of Fort Sumter, and while so were the Southern militias, it was only over the course of a year that the two sides built up their military. That would have happened, I think, no matter what Buchanan chose to do. Buchanan had nowhere near enough military power at his disposal to stop the Confederate threat completely. Maybe he could have taken one or two major Southern cities, but that would have just pissed off the rest of the Confederate states. With no federal troops ready to fight the other states, it would have given the other Southern states a chance to organize their war effort anyway. Ultimately, I think it would have been a similar situation than what happened.

Buchanan's Secretary of War, John B. Floyd, actually tried to convince Buchanan to abandon Fort Sumter all together, and order the federal troops stationed there to leave the state. Buchanan refused the recommendation without even entertaining it. Floyd resigned, and a few weeks later, a federal prosecutor brought a case against Floyd to a grand jury, who indicted him on conspiracy against the United States charges. Buchanan could have pardoned Floyd, or told the prosecutor--working in Buchanan's Justice Department--to back off, but he didn't do either. A federal judge actually ended up dismissing the case before trial a few days after Lincoln became president.

Ultimately, Buchanan was in a political bind. It's easy to look back at it in hindsight and say Buchanan should have mobilized troops and maybe he could have prevented the war. But he had no idea there would *be* a war at all, as there were active efforts going on at the time which still looked like they would *prevent* that war from ever happening. Had he gone ahead and been more proactive, it very likely would have started the war, and Lincoln would have had to deal with ""Buchanan's War"" and we'd remember Buchanan as even worse, not better, than we currently remember him as."
history,fclyzzx,t1_fclstih,1577759951.0,"I'd actually say Pierce was worse, though Buchanan is a solid second worst of all time. Most of Buchanan's decisions made sense in a ""I don't want there to be a war"" standpoint, even if they're mostly bad. And he made those decisions mostly as a result of the untenable situation Pierce's presidency had created.

Pierce position as president was basically ""The South is right, and the North better accept all these pro-South decisions, or else any war the South starts will be the North's fault"". He did almost everything he could to provoke the North. His idea of ""compromise"" was ""give the South everything they want to keep them happy"". Before Pierce became president, a Civil War was a possibility but not yet inevitable. At the end of his presidency, a proxy war had already started in Kansas. The only thing that stopped a national war from breaking out the day he left office was that Buchanan got elected, and there was still mild hope that Buchanan could come in and resolve Pierce's fuck-ups. If Pierce had been re-elected (which couldn't have happened because even his own party hated him enough they didn't renominate him) or if anybody besides Buchanan had been elected in 1856, the war would have started right then, pretty much all thanks to the decisions made during Pierce's presidency.

That's not to say Buchanan was in any way good. Both of them are at the bottom of the list, but I'd give Pierce the slight edge as ""worst of all time"". And as ex-presidents, between the two, Pierce easily takes the cake, though he might be second worst to Tyler, who actually became a traitor and joined the Confederacy. But at least Tyler had the excuse that he was actually from Virginia, and had the decency to die before he'd done much of anything. Pierce was from New Hampshire, lived throughout the war, and short of actually defecting, he did everything he could to undermine Lincoln, the North, and the war effort pretty much until the day Lincoln was assassinated."

history,fcllzrp,t1_fclj03p,1577750916.0,"I was going to recommend the same. Essentially, Van Buren supported Lincoln and the Union, Tyler joined the Confederates, and Fillmore was a firm Unionist but occasionally publicly (and even more so privately) criticized the Lincoln administration. 

Pierce was a ""Copperhead"" who played the ""both sides"" card. He called himself a Unionist, but criticized the Lincoln administration vocally and regularly, saying in a speech of July 4, 1864, that Lincoln was just as much to blame for the situation as the Confederates were, and if Lincoln continued to treat the Constitution as he had been, then the Confederates were justified in what they were doing. 

Buchanan was firmly a pro-Unionist, and considered secession and the Confederate cause both illegal and political suicide. Unlike the other ex-Presidents, Buchanan remained neutral on the Lincoln administration both privately and publicly, though he supported the Unionist cause regardless."
AskHistorians,fcjd5cu,t3_ehgbmo,1577683541.0,"Domestic workers. It is surmised that M. Johnson was ""Mary"", a domestic worker who Mary Todd Lincoln referred to in a letter who was hired to help during the winter, and had also been employed by the Lincolns the year before.

Phillip Dinkell was probably the son of a nearby neighbor in Springfield who house-sat for the Lincolns while they were away. If that is the case, then he is ~~likely~~ possibly the one who answered the census, since the Lincolns would have been out, or else ""Mary"" did. Though considering the ages of the Lincolns are all given correctly, possibly not.

Katherine Mentz writes in *The Lincoln Home: Lincoln Home National Historic Site, Springfield, Illinois, Volume 2, Issue 2* that M. Johnson was likely an Irish immigrant, because the Lincolns had ""a succession of Irish girls"" that worked for them as domestic workers dating back to at least 1850. Mary Todd Lincoln had written to her sister in 1856 about dealing with ""the Wild Irish"" in her housekeeping duties.

Mentz goes on:

> ""Herndon, in his biography of Lincoln, commented that Mary had difficulty keeping servants because of her ""peculiar nature;"" however, most families had difficulties keeping hired help for any length of time. Population studies have shown that nineteenth century domestic workers were very transient.
>
> ""There is evidence that Mary had at least one servant for several years. In a letter, written to Hanna Shearer on October 2, 1859, she remarked that ""Mary, the same girl I had last winter is still with me, a very faithful servant, has become as submissive as possible.""
>
> """"Mary"" also may be the same ""M. Johnson,"" a hired girl listed as residing in the Lincoln household in the 1860 Census. In addition to M. Johnson, the 1860 Census listed a fourteen-year-old boy, Phillip Dinkell, as a member of the household. One neighborhood boy reminisced that Mr. Lincoln used to pay him five shillings a night to stay in the house while he was away. Staying overnight at the Lincolns' may have been one of Phillip's major duties. A Mrs. Dinkell, according to the Springfield City Directory, lived not far from the Lincolns and she may have been Phillip's mother. It seems likely, however, that Phillip also performed other chores. With Lincoln's political campaigning and the additional entertaining the Lincolns were doing in the years after they enlarged their house, they probably needed additional help. Up to that time, however, it seems they had only one servant. Emilie Todd recalled that just one girl helped Mary during her visit in 1854-55. Certainly while campaigning, Lincoln had little time for the chores he used to do when they first moved into the house.""

*Abraham Lincoln: A Life, Volume 1* by Michael Burlingame has a little bit more information about the Dinkell or ""Dingle"" family. Phillip's mother, Barbara, was a widow, according to the 1860-61 Springfield City Directory, and lived on Edwards Street between Eighth and Ninth streets, just a block and a half away from the Lincolns. Phillip Dinkell was probably the same person who was born in Germany about 1845, appeared on the Union army rolls from Sangamon County, Illinois, in 1862-63, and died of consumption in 1865."
