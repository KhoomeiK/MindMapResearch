highdeas,ffrgs1i,t1_ffq9cyi,1580157746.0,I chew it sometimes to freshen my breath. Pro Tip: it's not as tasty as it sounds and it leaves a lot of teeny pieces behind! I'm not sure if it's as beneficial as brushing and flossing your teeth.

Curious about my down vote though. No one owes me an explanation but I didn't think my post was that controversial!"

dogswithjobs,ffnoicx,t1_fdd3s7o,1580068573.0,"I agree that there's a real need for Emotional Support Animals. However, until they're trained and certified as Service Dogs they should not be permitted in restaurants, theaters, or airplane cabins. They should be required to meet the same standards as other service animals.

But to the point about passengers with severe allergies, I'm stumped for an answer. Yes, the flight crew could move you to a seat further away from the animal, but that's not a complete fix. An allergy (or phobia, for that matter) doesn't give a flying leap about certification."
aww,ffnmbs9,t1_ffmekd6,1580067801.0,And not all blind people are 100% blind. They just can't see well enough to comfortably function independently in society but can still wipe their own ass.
aww,ffnkhfz,t1_ffnahl3,1580067186.0,I'm guessing the guy's friend?
aww,ffnhf40,t1_ffnebpq,1580066019.0,"Yes and no. I ALWAYS ask to pet a dog first whether it's a working dog or not. Some pets are not at all friendly to strangers or are still learning socialization and not yet ready for interaction. And many guide dog owners prefer to keep their animals in a ""working"" mindset until the harness comes off.  (If you're lucky enough to be around then it's often PLAY TIME for the pooch!)

100% of the people I ask, thank me for checking with them first, regardless of their answer."
nextfuckinglevel,ffnghuo,t1_ffn3q91,1580065637.0,"Not that your question was addressed to me, but I've been in California all my life. I remember being taught about the metric system as a child in the '70s. I wish they hadn't stopped doing that.

As a side note, my mom was concerned about the U.S. switching from imperial to metric.  ""How could they even do it?"" she asked. ""It would be too expensive.  They'd have to move all of the freeway exits if they change the signs to kilometers!!"""
nextfuckinglevel,ffnfcqu,t1_ffltzkg,1580065265.0,"Thank you  Xannon99182. Even as an American, I wish we would just get over ourselves and switch to metric.  I appreciate your ""translation"" to help me put this into perspective."
raisedbynarcissists,ffnej9i,t1_ffmwu0t,1580064920.0,"I disagree that religion poisons everything.

Religion gives me hope that there's someone who cares and that there's something worthwhile to look forward to at the end of this life. At 53 years old, I'm messed up enough by my narcissistic mother's manipulation (OCD, paranoia, guilt, and indecisiveness) so having hope in the God I believe in has been my lifeline all these decades. And now that my loving father has recently passed away, mom is getting weirder since there's no longer anyone under her roof to serve her.

But I would absolutely agree that the abuse of religion poisons everything, include the religion itself."
