marvelstudios,febw16x,t3_eo6p67,1578963421.0,This is probably part of the reason Disney considered cancelling their deal with Sony if Sony didn’t give them creative control of Spider-man universe films. Sony is trying to strong arm more movies into the MCU that Marvel didn’t have in their plan and this can screw with their continuity and lower the overall quality of their brand. If Keaton was called in AFTER the Marvel deal was sealed to shoot those scenes then it’s a good thing. If it was before Marvel and Sony sealed the deal it just shows Sony doesn’t give a shit about the quality of the characters and are trying to scrape as much money out of Spider-man as possible via cheap ploys.

AskMen,fdn3p5z,t3_elwlva,1578576371.0,"On multiple occasions I have had my ass/crotch grabbed at bars or clubs without permission. Once a really drunk girl walked up and just started making out with me. Sometimes others see, sometimes they don’t, but almost every time when they do the response is laughter.

I don’t intend for this to sound mean, but it’s not usually the attractive girls that do this, it’s the girls that are below average to average looking. My best guess is they don’t get the same attention as other girls so they think that “maybe if I let them know I’m DTF they’ll give me attention” and thus go on a grabbing spree. I’m not an outrageously attractive guy, I’d place myself around average which is actually why I think I get it so often. I’m not surrounded by girls so I’m approachable but attractive enough that I’m desirable to them I guess?

I never feel “threatened” tho, just uncomfortable or annoyed. I think that’s the main difference between a girl doing it and a guy doing it, guys are less vulnerable and therefore don’t feel like they’re less safe when it occurs. Still, there is a massive double standard around this stuff and I will say 100% women can be as grabby and sometimes even more grabby than the men in a club on a given night, it just depends on the night."

1. I don’t like Nazis, they deserved to be punched however punching them only perpetuates problems. This form of suppression has never worked, it’s nothing more than self gratification. Understandable yes, productive no.

2. The other issue is the people defining who is or isn’t a nazi, words lose their meaning when words are overused as a way of justifying self gratifying use of violence and reduces the seriousness and weight of what being a nazi really is.
