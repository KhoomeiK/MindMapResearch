depression,feox2w0,t1_feo3qfz,1579307267.0,What kind of stuff have you found a passion for? How has it helped you specifically? The kind of routine and study of it? Just curious for my own interest. I have a subject I'm interested in that I'd like to study more on but rarely find the time between work and resting from work :(
depression,fekwgm4,t3_epiyby,1579209023.0,Honestly I dream about a life where the girl who is not interested in me in real life is my current girlfriend. Then I wake up and get sad that I'm alone. Dosent help that I've been refused for counselling today as they say I'm not too bad. What the fuck am I doing with my life
depression,fe0hlnz,t3_enfyh1,1578813557.0,"I have this with a girl I like. We were good friends for a long time and admittedly I had a crush on her. She eventually responded to messages less and less. Which doesn't help when I no longer work with her. So this makes me think she hates me and doesn't want to speak to me anymore. But then she buys me Christmas and birthday presents without fail. I'm so confused, I wish we could chat like we used to but I think it's better for my mental health if we don't"
depression,f9rw157,t3_e6k4l8,1575582090.0,I'm 27 since October just gone and I always say I'll never live past 35. I feel like joking about it is what is keeping me alive. Although I almost killed myself a week ago on Thursday. I'm not sure what I'm after but I have a couple of most likely superficial reasons why I hate my life. I still don't know what to do or how to handle things. I feel trapped most of the time and my current medication seems worse for memory issues than any previous kinds I have taken
