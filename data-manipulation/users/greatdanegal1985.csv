Do not leave your child with him and leave your house. You can separate all you want, but talk with a lawyer first, please. Many times you can get a free consultation."
AskReddit,ffgioa0,t3_etcyd6,1579907118.0,"I lost my male cousin to suicide. My adult nephew attempted, but called the national hotline who then called the police and they were actually helpful and got him the help he needed. My adult brother is suicidal right now. 

I’ve lost male friends to suicide as well. Women are actually more likely to attempt, but men are more likely to pick a method that will get the job done.

I’m terrified of losing another loved one this way."

mildlyinfuriating,ffbz0ed,t3_esjy49,1579787218.0,"I’ve been in retail for over a decade. Part of the problem is how over stuffed the rack is for clearance items. You try to put something back and ten more things fall. 

Yes, there are definitely entitled assholes, but when you make sure clearance items are easy to shop (room on the rack, sorted by size, item type, and color) then this doesn’t happen nearly as much."

CsectionCentral,ffb6a71,t3_esmawt,1579752930.0,"My milk didn’t come in for 4-5 days. I pumped every three hours round the clock while my son was in the nicu. I got a little bit here and there (like one ml). It finally came in. He was born a little early at 37+5. 

I did triple feeding for about 3-4 weeks once we were able to bring him home. Triple feeding is nurse, express, formula. I stopped doing that once he consistently didn’t take the formula for about a week. I then stopped pumping after feeds once he stopped drinking that milk for about a week. 

We also did weigh and feeds throughout this whole process to ensure he was getting enough."

However, the main reason Gilead exists is because fertility dropped dramatically and a certain set of people saw it as a way to exploit their religion to gain power. Their argument is the world is given fewer babies because the world is corrupt and immoral; follow us and there will be more babies."
frisco,fevhn4u,t1_fevapdw,1579397579.0,"I grew up in Irving too. My dad was a doctor and the kids that went to my school were from all walks life including children that were in section 8 housing. Personally, it helped me a lot as a person because I saw that everyone wasn’t the kid of a doctor. 

I agree that Frisco also needs more starter to lower-middle class to middle class homes. I think that diverse, safe, and comfortable housing for all income levels is key to having a stable and productive city."

AskHR,femt5tu,t1_fems0ym,1579268886.0,"It would be worse. Yes, HR is there to protect the company by mitigating risk, but many times those actions benefit and protect the employees (if done correctly)."
AskHR,femt337,t3_epvrvy,1579268825.0,"Take your evidence to the Department of Labor. 

The employer can make changes to timesheets as long as though changes reflect actual hours worked. For example, an employee forgets to clock in, so the employer adds that punch. Some states allow you to auto-deduct the unpaid lunch break and it is the employee’s responsibility to actually take their lunch break as outlined in their handbook.

If HR didn’t tell you to not discuss the investigation, they can’t assume you knew not to. They might have footing if your handbook outlines a process for conflict resolution and that includes confidentiality. 

BCC any communications to your personal email so you can maintain a copy. Document everything to the best of your ability: time, date, event, possible witnesses."

humanresources,feklccb,t1_fekjlca,1579202440.0,"The CFO needs to give you some guidelines. What are critical roles? What are the goals? How much needs to be trimmed? What departments bring in money? Which ones don’t? Are the ones that don’t providing a service the company needs? Could that service be outsourced for less? Could attrition handle some of the requirements (severance packages and unemployment can be expensive). 

Another thing to think about is RIF freak out those that stay. How will it be communicated to the rest of the population? What support will be in place for those that are RIFed? Think about your core values and how they would apply to this situation."
