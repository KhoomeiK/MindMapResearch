Damn. That single masterpiece of a scene was so emotional.

Honestly if you have never seen Mr. Robot please watch it.

Especially in the northern states in India.

Now I am not saying these things don't happen in other states. Its just that the frequency is a lot more in north.

Over population, corrupt government, literate but uneducated hoardes, ignorant society, no sex education, no guidance from parents, porn being accessible to everyone. 

Its a clusterfuck of problems. 

But I am just happy to say there are more genuinely good people then horny bastards (by products of ignorant society?)"

Android,fde6kuq,t1_fde4cc2,1578332298.0,"I had a Moto G first edition prior to using Samsung S7. The investment felt worth in every possible way. 

Premium build, best camera at launch, security update every month with a promise of 3 years which Samsung delivered. 

This still plays graphic intensive games like call of duty or Ashphalt 8 without any drop in performance. 

I even bought my Dad a J series phone from samsung. 

So this really is a shocker for me that something like this in built and hidden away. 

I always thought Samsung was a safe bet since the onslaught of Chinese owned phone brands entering the market but that doesn't seem to be true now.

Not a fan of Pixel (features offered vs price ratio).

Although I will consider LG as an option too later this year.

As far as launchers are concerned I am using Evie and quiet happy with it."

Samsung has been my brand since long. There might be other issues that we don't know about. To be honest Samsung is the only thing that I made me stay on team Android.

Time to jump the ship I guess."
