Divorce,ff0yxq7,t1_ff0uv4c,1579473660.0,"It looks like you deleted your previous response which included an apology. Kinda wild that you decided to do that. I’m not going to repost what you said but sad that you deleted it and instead of apologizing decided to take the route of another attack.

Of course I can get upset at your interpretation because I not only didn’t say I was intending to do any of things you assumed I would but I never even hinted to it. Again, really sad that you decided to delete your caring supportive apology, because it was appropriate. I didn’t do anything to deserve your nasty assumptions. Like I said before, if you wanna help, ask for clarity before just giving your “interpretation” which is meaningless as it’s not founded in anything and just plain and simple mean. I’m sorry you were burned but I have no intention of doing that to my spouse. But I did not deserve your berating  because of your experience.   

If you’re just gonna lurk on here and find posts of people who are going through a hard time and looking for advice on how to proceed, maybe offer some nice words and advice from your harrowing experience like you did in your initial response and apology that you deleted. Don’t take it on me or anyone else. I’m glad this subreddit helped you after your horrible experience but this subreddit is for people going through any stage of it. So realize that and don’t be awful. Plain and simple.


Here is my original response to the reply you deleted. I won’t post your initial response as you know what you said and I don’t think that’s a nice move even though you treated me with no respect or regard (in fact did the opposite) so I won’t do it. But please take caution in replying to other people because they don’t deserve your terrible words just because your spouse did you wrong


My original reply to your apology....



Thank you for the apology. I realized after I responded that you probably had a traumatizing experience that led to your reaction. I in no way shape or form am planning to do any of those things so I appreciate the apology.

Thank you for the advice as well. I’m worried that things will get ugly when I really don’t want them to. I value our time together and the relationship we had. She was and always will be a big part of my life; even afterwards I will have been with her for almost a 3rd of my life so there’s no way she won’t be. But unfortunately ultimately I know this is not a healthy marriage. Even if we work on it at the end of the day we are not well suited for each other. I’m really really hoping things won’t get ugly.  We don’t have too much to split but enough that it could become a problem. I want to do amicably and collaboratively. 

Thank you for the advice and I appreciate the words of caution because of course it’s a big emotional ordeal and no matter what one says things can always get ugly. Again, really hoping it doesn’t. Thanks."
Divorce,fezr9uq,t1_fezl7ka,1579460645.0,"I have no idea what you're talking about or where you gathered all these assumptions.

Obviously I am not going to ghost my wife wtf? Nor is she going to be blind sighted. For one we have huge regular fights all the time where each of us has thrown in the divorce card when we’re heated. She also knows how I feel that I am unhappy and knows that we are having serious problems and even with that I made tons of calls to marriage counselors and all she has to do is call and make an intake apt. 

We had a therapist a year ago but we didn’t like him. I can’t work on things if my wife isn’t willing to go to counseling with me. I have made it literally as easy as possible for her but with the way it works she needs to do an intake by herself first. I gave her the info a month ago to call and again I was the one making all the calls and getting the info and seeing where we could afford to go.

My therapist never said to do any of those things, “cut her off; stop talking to her, try to take all the assets”??!? Where the fuck do you come off assuming I’m going to be doing any of those things and calling/implying me/I'm a narcissist? You have no idea what my plan was. It was to do collaborative divorce. And I have no intention of taking all the assets nor do we even have many assets to begin with. 

Of course I am going to talk about my marriage with my therapists. Because that’s a big part of my life. He never told me to do a single thing. I’m just having a hard time telling my wife I want a divorce because I do love her but we aren’t a good fit together. I want to be having the conversation with my wife. I am just having a hard time initiating the conversation and that's what my therapist has been helping me do.

Jesus fucking Christ. Where the fuck do you come off?

Some redditors/people never cease to amaze me. It’s in an interesting time we live in. I was just looking for advice on how to approach the topic with my wife and I figured r/divorce would be that place - apparently not. It seems so far it's mainly been a bunch of people who make wild assumptions and being completely off base assholes. With the exception of the two people who were supportive. Why not ask questions before assuming things if you actually care to respond and advise or help? I’m certainly talking to the wrong people about divorce, you’re right on that. And that’s talking to you.

Edit: Grammer"
Divorce,fewmau2,t1_fewlzf0,1579414472.0,Thank you! Really appreciate it.
Divorce,fevitzm,t1_fetfd7s,1579397919.0,"That’s literally the definition of a therapist. 

Regardless this is a decision I’ve come to on my own. I am not really sure why you guys are hung up on the therapist aspect of it. End of day this is a decision I’ve made and am just expressing it’s hard to follow through because I’ve been together for 8 yrs and care a lot about her and all that comes along with divorce:

You guys are completely missing the point of my post. We have gone o counseling together. Again, I’ll repeat myself I shouldn’t look for advice from strangers. I thought this would be a supportive community with people who have experience with this."
Divorce,ferqhgz,t1_fepq0d5,1579357185.0,"Thank you for your reply kind stranger. I know I need to do this. I can't believe its happening and I try to rationalize staying but I can't. I will be mistreated for the rest of my life and not supported. I will not be able to accomplish the things I am setting out to because of this. I will be miserable because my marriage is unhealthy and as you aptly said it, I am being treated as her punching bag. 

I have to stay strong and do it. It is definitely the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I need to do it for myself and as you said my future self.

Thank you for that reminder and kind response."
Divorce,ferpvun,t1_fepvedm,1579356991.0,"Not sure why therapist is in quotations but we have gone to marriage counseling together where nothing came of it. My therapist is aware that I am only sharing my side of the story and is still appalled by some of the things that have taken place. Regardless of what my therapist feels because he is not in my marriage, it is ultimately up to me and what matters most is my perspective on how I am being treated and not supported. There are things in my marriage that make it obvious to me that even if we went back to more counseling nothing would come of it. She has literally said to me ""she can't change and I need to learn to work around her"". There are so many red flags. We are not a team nor unit but essentially glorified roommates where I am being thrown around and walked all over. 

Yes, of course, she will have a different perspective and feel that this is not happening, which honestly is part of the problem. If she were able to see it from my perspective then maybe we wouldn't have so many problems. Either way, if one partner is extremely unhappy in the marriage and feels taken advantage of, then imo, its that partner's right to leave the marriage. You don't need a reason to leave a marriage other than being unhappy. Yes, that would be extremely selfish if that were the only reason, but for me, it's not. I am not being supported in any way shape or form and my mental health is suffering. As the commentator below put it, I am being treated as her punching bag. I know from her perspective she doesn't feel its this way but again, that's part of the problem.

It is my mistake for posting and expecting everyone to be supportive and understand as Reddit is literally just a forum with complete strangers over the internet from all around the world. **But I posted because I know that I should ask for a divorce but am having trouble doing so because I do care about my partner and it will be an extremely difficult thing to do.** **I was looking more for advice on how to get past this block.** Not for someone to tell me my ""therapist"" should hear it from her POV when he understands he is only getting the negatives, but the point is that the negatives are so appalling that her perspective wouldn't change much. And again, I do hear her perspective, believe me, I do cuz she yells it at me and I know this is what I need to do for myself out of self-respect and for the sake of the rest of my life.   


TLDR: Not sure why you said ""therapist"", he has a doctorate in psychology and is my therapist. Regardless of credentials I find him very helpful in all areas of my life and he is experienced and not an idiot and understands he is only hearing the worst of it and me venting but with that, he still thinks it's unhealthy for me to be in this marriage. Regardless of his thoughts, I am the one in the marriage and **know I need to do this for myself but I am having trouble doing so because its a difficult thing to do**. To tell someone you want a divorce after you've been married for a bit and together for much longer. Also, everything that comes with it afterward and not sure how to navigate that. **This is not a healthy marriage, we have worked on it to no avail, I need to get out and need some advice on how to not second guess myself, go through with it, deliver the news, and navigate things afterward.**"
ect,felspg4,t3_epml08,1579229985.0,"From what I have read and heard from psychiatrists unilateral is just as effective but as you noted with fewer side effects. There is no reason to believe that bilateral will be more effective, at least from what I have read in literature. I would discuss this with your psychiatrist though. 

There are other variables that can be changed in terms of the delivery of electricity - like pulse length, pulse train, and energy applied.  As far as I understand the idea is to produce a seizure in the prefrontal cortex where it then propagates to other areas of the brain unintentionally like the hippocampus which produces the side effects in memory. So changing those parameters won't do much in terms of efficacy as the idea is really just to initiate a seizure and ideally using the lowest amount of energy required to do so as raising it will only increase side effects. Unilateral ECT generally does not have as many side effects because the seizures do not propagate as far and are more controlled.

TLDR: As far as I know Unilateral is just as effective as Bilateral. I would talk to your psychiatrist though about your specific concerns though."
selfimprovement,fe6ayor,t1_fe475o9,1578885815.0,"Such an amazing book. I am trying to write my favorite takeaways from books that I read from now on and I just finished ""Man's Search for Meaning"" but I keep pushing it off so the comments below me are helpful lol. The edition I had also had a great afterward that I am gonna reread cuz it wrapped it up pretty well."
selfimprovement,fe6ac73,t1_fe5s8qu,1578885361.0,"I totally understand your POV. I am of the mind, live the life you want to. It's your fucking life, no one else's. As long as you're not hurting anyone else I congratulate you, or anyone for that matter, for doing whatever it is that they actually want to do with their life. I don't think there is anything wrong with your POV by any means.

I personally am going to try for an ambitious career. But not just for the sake of having one but because there are things that I am passionate about and want to spend my life attempting and hopefully changing for the better. I would like to change the face of mental health care. 

I honestly agree with you and don't really see the utility in having an ambitious career just for the sake of having an ambitious career. But at the same time who the hell am I to tell them how to live their life? Just like I would never tell you how to live your life, I wouldn't want to tell them either. It's their life. If that's how they want to spend it, then I say go for it and congratulate them on doing so as long as they're not hurting anyone else."
