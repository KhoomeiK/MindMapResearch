PublicSpeaking,ffir0ye,t3_etv0l2,1579980555.0,"I've had and I always have this kind of problem, but I found somewhat of a solution:
Think of the people in front of you like a puppet. 
Don't watch them directly in the eyes, that would be your death sentence because you would go full panic attack, instead watch their nose it can get the job done.
Before having the presentation, make a mental list of what you have to say (it's very helpful if you find yourself stuck in the middle of the presentation).
Breathing is one of the key; slow but steady breaths.
If you find yourself more stressed turn briefly to the screen and see what's showing, you'll have a moment to """" ""relax"" """".
Good luck to you!"
