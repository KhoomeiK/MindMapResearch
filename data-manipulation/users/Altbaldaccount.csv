depression,ffmy94j,t3_eu0jpv,1580060164.0,"It's the same with me. But I recently realised I'm competitive by nature ( result of taking nothing seriously in my younger years and achieving nothing ).   
  
So I've set then as challenges towards me. I set very high expectations, don't reach them then i feel sad but i try and keep pushing through.  
  
I know it feels like a waste, but do it for the legacy you'll want to leave behind.  
  
I really wish you come out of the darkness and keep in moving forward"
depression,ffmxeq9,t1_ffl0jxe,1580059880.0,"Turning 27 next month. Made a new friend last year. Hearing their experience made me feel like I've wasted my life till date.  
  
I regret it, regret my choices, but I've understood i cant change it. So I'm trying to change my future and get to their level in the coming future.  
  
I know it feels bad when comparing, but everyone has their own pace ( i feel like I'm going slow for someone it might be fast it's relative) but reminiscing the past doesn't help much.  
  
I wish there forthcoming years are much better for all of us"
depression,ffmwdbg,t3_etzlpc,1580059639.0,"So true. I'm like the most sociable person one day, the other day i dont feel like talking to anyone.  
  
I'm always trying to force myself to appear to be happy and communicate. It gets tiring very fast"

AskReddit,ffgogb4,t3_etcyd6,1579911031.0,"Having different set of standards especially based on gender.  
  
Eg. Where I live, many woman look for a man who is capable of taking care of them financially or earning more than ten ( or they take the role of the house maker ), but if a man would look for the same he'll be shamed to death. ( Not saying there aren't other problems especially amongst not much educated population. But even in many educated families the family look for not a partner for their son but a person who can be their care taker. So it has set a precedent that a man whether by choice or condition should always be able to take care of his family financially).
  
Saying it's a feminine concern and you should not be worried about it.  
Eg. If a guy refuses to work late saying he wants to go home, it may be looked bad for him, but if a female raises the same concern is seen as normal ( I'm not saying it's always the born. There are many wonderful females who work late nights to get with done but was stating something which I've observed).  
   
It happens with everyone.   
I'm going through a lot of concerns about my careers future atm (mainly if i want to progress in career I'll have to move a lot around the country which will most likely have a negative impact on my family, if i get married and i don't want that. So I'm now put off by the thought of getting married). I know even if I voice the concern to my family I wouldn't get much support but most likely be shot down. They'll be like what's the problem, your wife can stay at one place and take care of things. I feel if we can't stay together for a decent chunk of time then what's the point of getting married.  
  
Then there are body image issues. The days ads, social messages are targeted to make with women feel proud of their self image, whereas men there's no such thing for men. Most men centric advertisements/shows are made showing a picture perfect man, and if one isn't gifted is shown as a loser.  
  
  
I know i might be coming of as misogynist, but I'm not. I have utmost respect for them, but it's true these days playing field in terms of support is not the same. Even in guilty of being partial towards men and it breaks me everyday ( like I'll encourage my female friends/sister's to find a man to settle who's eq and iq is high, intellectual, can provide a good roof and food over their heads, earns good amount so that even if they decide to be stay at home mums or quit their jobs and do something the man would be able to provide for them.  
While I expect myself to be that man, and when I'm in a position from where i can't see myself being that person it brings me down ( that is what's happening to me since last few months).  
  
When I see other men around me who don't live with such stigma I wish i could break out of it, forget these things and be ME. I'm happy for them.  
  
But I've set my expectations from myself based on societal norms so much ( the very thing i wanted to break) I lose a part of myself every other day and i think someday I'll lose enough of myself to consider leaving this world.
  
All this I can't share with friends because most won't understand it and even if i did will crack a joke about it and change the topic.  
  
I don't with family because i anticipate their response and i don't want to bother them with this."

AskReddit,ff4eyqa,t1_ff2r534,1579562008.0,"> I've lost many friends by being the depressed one, and never being told they couldn't give me what I needed and that I was essentially pulling them down with me. Now, I wish they'd told me they couldn't bear it, and that I needed more than just them.    
  
I dread this so much. Though my parents are lovelies but growing up I didn't have much problems/concern per say, but those I had were unconventional and when I talked about those they were mostly ignored.  
   
I didn't think much about it, but after so many years they've had an impact on me, not so positive though.  
  
I've become an introvert, I don't talk freely with someone whom I don't now, I don't take the pain to befriend someone when I know I won't be staying in that place for long.   . 
   
With this problem, there's no way I'd talk to anyone about what I'm going through"
nottheonion,ff4czku,t1_ff48886,1579560699.0,"Where I live, I did the mistake if going to state job. Both parents were in one, didn't know much. The working hours are okayish pay is good enough for single person, but no social security benefits as what my parents got.  
  
Now I dread the decision of switching to state job everyday. Could have stayed in private capitalist fun, worked like a capitalist, earned what I'll do in my entire state job career in 20 years and retire after that.  
  
Currently I don't know how my retirement will be, I don't think of getting married or in a relationship because down the line expenses will rise and I don't wish to be in a condition of living pay cheque to pay cheque. There senior Management ( of baby boomer generation) is oblivious to what the problems new joinees will face and therefore their decisions for the welfare are based on their own experiences of past (and to make their retirement more comfortable ).  
   
I've lost my skills to switch to private now. Only option I have is to switch to a better paying state job (which isn't easy in it's own way) and then work on setting up some business, down the line which would eliminate my financial worries and if I have children by then, they'll won't have to go through the issues I went through.

Don't rush things. If she decides to leave it'll be in much better terms, if left otherwise (i hope not), if she forgives you then you'll have a chance to show you are better person.  
  
Either way funny force her into making a decision or anything."

depression,fdgm64u,t3_el8rwc,1578401977.0,"I'm depressed as a consequence of me doing everything bring criticised, always being under passive aggressive control and not having a choice per say in many things in life. As to it their own apprehension to socialise with people and avoiding then added to the problem. Yes I'm grateful I was given freedom to choose my career and was given financial support, so I feel an obligation to return the favor to the best of my ability. But emotionally I feel detached, there's nothing there, I don't think I'll mourn for anyone, I don't feel I'm capable to do so.  
  
As a result I could never get close to friends because I was afraid I'd be criticised and then have to face passive aggressiveness. Hence I never built the social skills to befriend anyone or stay close to them.  
  
Whenever someone becomes close friends I feel like I'm with my awkwardness dragging then down always and I get afraid and create distance. Now I mostly feel obligated to accompany someone than rather going out for fun. I can't communicate, I feel useless, a burden on people around me, a gloomy person.  
  
Basically I have no identity and just a shadow who pulls people into darkness along with them.  
  
I'm grateful for people raising me, but I'm also this way because of the behavior and reaction of few people.  
  
I just wish I would be gone, I'll probably be gone once my immediate relatives are gone, because then I won't have any duty to fullfil towards anyone."

Have busy schedule cuz of work and studying. It's my choice, I need to excel in both I have no choice, cuz failing in either will bring me down to a new level, since my future depends on both. 
  
But at the end of the day I still feel like empty. Though I don't have time left for anything, but I don't feel anything by end of the day.  
   
Gifted someone a gift, they were happy (or seemed happy idk wasn't there in person ) but I couldn't feel the excitement.  
  
All I can feel is fear of my failure and anxiety for uncertain events."
depression,fde7g4y,t3_ekx5g0,1578332841.0,"Too long. Was in a bad state compared to now. Where I just felt not worth to take any decision of my own and always relied on someone else to tell me what to do.

depression,fde2z5l,t3_ekpvdz,1578330019.0,"Same here. Can't cuddle physically but sending virtual hugs.  
  
I'm anxious all day everyday about something. It so bad I either don't talk or it's about it always so I just stay mum cuz it gets overbearing for people around me.  
  
Saw a movie yesterday, it hit my insecurities wanted to cry but couldn't.  
  
Feels bad being away from family to whom I could give random hugs even though never have I ever really opened up with them aswell.

If you don't and try to fight it yourself, unintentionally you're behavior will exhibit some change. She'll sense the change. If you don't tell her she'll think it's her fault or something.  
  
Rather than making her go through this, sit with her and tell everything. Start from before you meet her, tell her how it has affected you in past and what you've done in those times. Then tell her that it's coming back and you don't want her to think she's the cause of it. Stress on telling her how she makes you happy.  
  
Talk it out. It'll definitely lead to a better scenario than not talking and trying to handle it yourself."

Try not to let people take advantage of you though. Be kind yet strict. Take your stance. If they don't respect you tell them exactly what they're doing and take a break from them.
