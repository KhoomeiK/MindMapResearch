Needafriend,ff5ih2o,t1_ff59env,1579594385.0,I'm sorry I don't think you understand what widowed means..
Needafriend,ff4ivl4,t1_ff4gfmi,1579564680.0,Thank you I really appreciate it
depression,ff4fyzi,t1_ff4ftbl,1579562688.0,Thank you that's really kind
depression,fezvxm1,t1_fezs975,1579462355.0,Thanks that's really helpful. I'll definitely try that
depression,fezk9zn,t1_fezcw4b,1579458237.0,I think its just because I've lost all enjoyment in life. Food was such a big one. I'm still losing weight even though I really dont need to lose more.
MetalMemes,fepuu4x,t3_eq7jic,1579332097.0,"You know OP isn't making a political statement right? They made it for their class. 
Really good, anything I ever made in Microsoft paint looks like I let a gibbon have at it."
depression,fepu2ov,t1_feptwi4,1579331310.0,"I'm not saying how you feel is wrong. I cant stop feeling like it myself. But I don't think I ever could,  because I know the pain it would inflict."
depression,feptq5y,t1_fept93h,1579330958.0,"They wouldn't. Suicide has ripped my life apart. Its like sulfuric acid, it just eats into every part of life. It's such a shit reason  to be dead. It's almost like you never really get to be happy again after someone does that to you."
depression,feptch5,t3_eqd2hn,1579330588.0,"To be honest if my boyfriend said he previously used a sex worker I wouldn't have an issue, as long as it wasn't on going.
You're only 23, things can and will turn around but you might have to drag yourself out of your rut a little bit"
depression,fept0hl,t3_eqd18a,1579330256.0,"Yeah I had a bad night of this the other day. I laid awake with my full plan in my head, but as I went through it I realised my dog would be abandoned by someone she loved yet again, so I went downstairs and cuddled her, it snapped me out of the intense suicidal thoughts but I was still really bad with it.
As a suicide survivor, I know how it affects this huge butterfly affect of people."
depression,fepsq0q,t3_eqd1hx,1579329978.0,"They have no bearing on your life, just remember that. When was the last time that particular person actually mean't something to you? 

It's funny how one ""small"" thing can ruin a normal day."
depression,fepry3v,t3_eqcz2d,1579329235.0,"I've found that when it hurts too much to bare I do well to talk it through with someone. I will try to force myself out for a walk, that helps me a lot, and if nothing else works, I sleep. 

Its debilitating,  and for me it feels like my chest is being crushed, and I can't ever imagine that pain leaving me, but eventually it always does"
depression,fenb9xi,t3_eq33kp,1579280993.0,"Is there anything you really want to do? Travel, have a family, learn a language? 
Find something like that, and put your resources into obtaining it, make it your focus, and just keep going for the next thing that you feel will fulfill you. Money is just a means to an end, maybe you need a big change."
depression,femt9y8,t1_femt57m,1579268978.0,"Thanks, that's really nice of you to say."
depression,femsnew,t1_femshsf,1579268469.0,"This is going to sound extremely depressing..and I apologise,  but after my birthday I have one month before I am officially older than my late husband. To be honest I didn't think I would make it long enough for that day to come, but here I am."
depression,femrtf5,t1_femrkir,1579267782.0,"Feel free to drop me a message any time, I'm always around and generally always in need of a chat."
depression,femr2t4,t1_femqzff,1579267150.0,Thank you. Life does feel very cruel a lot of the time.
depression,femqx4w,t1_femqqhh,1579267013.0,"I've found since I became ""the widow"" people don't talk to me about issues they are having,  because right now, I win! What a fun game. Thing is, you matter. Your problems matter,  you deserve to not be scared of what is going on with yourself."
depression,femqhtk,t1_femqely,1579266634.0,"Thanks, just not keen on getting older"
depression,femqcea,t1_femq6wl,1579266499.0,"Well, when I lost my husband last year I only found out afterwards that he was schizophrenic. I'd give anything to have known, to have helped him find treatment, I don't know. So many wishes."
depression,fempqvf,t1_fempmjt,1579265950.0,I think it's worth finding out. It's easier to defend yourself against things you don't want when you know what they are
depression,femlq97,t3_epzamj,1579261693.0,"I also feel like my life would cause anyone inescapable depression. 
Life is so changeable that by this time next year, month, or week something may have happened that turns your current perspective on its head. 
I hope its sooner rather than later for you."
Needafriend,femkkuz,t3_epx7mu,1579260238.0,Mate it's not ghosting if they say they don't want to chat anymore. Its natural for conservation to die over time and you're really only going to be left with people who really understand you. If you haven't found them yet then keep going!
Needafriend,femkaan,t3_epyqdl,1579259847.0,"I'd do great in a zombie apocalypse, because I'm a Londoner so I was born with a knife in my hand. Ever seen Cockneys Vs Zombies? 10/10 film."
depression,femjzbt,t3_epyxxm,1579259433.0,"No, you're not ok right now. You need to talk to a professional about this before it goes too far. You WILL be ok,  but this needs to be an open discussion for you and a doctor or therapist."
depression,femjsrx,t3_epyrkm,1579259184.0,"Yeah,  I can understand this. I told my friend I don't think I exist within the same timeframe that everyone else seems to exist within. Its difficult to find people that can understand, I feel like a loon just writing it down"
depression,femjmuz,t3_epyv0w,1579258948.0,"I do have friends now,  but I spent so long without any that I now have no idea how to human around them. I'm more comfortable with people online"
depression,femjfc0,t3_epy3tv,1579258650.0,"Atypical anorexia is a thing,  however you would be hard pressed to get a diagnosis for it. You were at an unhealthy weight, and although it's not ideal, weight loss may make it easier to do activities which will give you fulfillment and enrich your life, potentially helping with your depression.
If you can get yourself into more of a healthy diet,  it doesn't have to be perfect, maybe just focus on trying to get the nutrients you're currently missing."
depression,femj5kg,t3_epyj5d,1579258256.0,"It's not going to keep getting worse. Make small steps to improve your grades, grieve your friend, it's so hard to grieve properly, most people arent comfortable with seeing the raw reality of it. Please keep trying, you're not alone"
depression,femj1ns,t3_epyl4n,1579258097.0,"God this hits close to home. For the last 8 years I have had visual hallucinations whenever I'm even slightly ill.  I usually get them before I've even really worked out that I'm sick, maybe it's a similar thing for you?"
depression,femiyow,t3_epylwm,1579257980.0,"We all have to work on getting out of this pit. You're not alone, good thing about being a loser, it's not a permanent infliction!"

depression,femiufl,t3_epypqm,1579257806.0,"I have been struggling with this a lot. Now I'm out of work and I feel like I'm stuck in no man's land.  I can only hope that what my boyfriend says is true, things can and will get better, we just  need to work a bit harder."
Advice,fejk88u,t1_fejk65h,1579177654.0,Thank you. I guess I have a lot to mentally get through.
Advice,fejjiey,t1_fejjfg8,1579176890.0,Almost certainly. Life just feels so short.
waiting_to_try,fdxs1gz,t1_fdxrr2f,1578772333.0,"Thank you, hopefully I can work myself up to speak about it with him, I feel like I keep going on and on but I never really say all that i want to say to him"
waiting_to_try,fdxrdfj,t1_fdxqjf3,1578772179.0,"I'm 26, I think the mental block for him is a bigger factor than physical, he doesn't want to be chasing kids around when hes ""old"" but I said he would be doing that anyway if we had grandchildren"
TryingForABaby,fdv4dkr,t1_fdv45wl,1578743094.0,"He said he never considered it to be possible until he met me, he seems very smitten with the idea"

SuicideWatch,fdrwj44,t1_fdrnhjb,1578690767.0,"I'm part of a few groups, they help"
SuicideWatch,fdr8sf3,t1_fdr6fzr,1578681099.0,"I went to bereavement councilling for a while until it just became useless to me, theres nothing like that where I live, I'd hoped to create that service one day."
relationships,fdqqdyq,t3_empvii,1578672637.0,"either love and accept him and try to move forward with him, give him healthy options, encourage him to love himself, get out on walks, discuss your future, do you want kids together? Would he really want to pass this unhealthy lifestyle to his children? And it you don't want kids, surely he wants a long life with the woman he married. 
You can either accept him for who he is, or you have to let him go. Its not fair on him that you find his behaviour repulsive. 
I lost my husband last year, and quite honestly I'd let that man eat a whole birthday cake right now as long as I could sit and watch him."
ironmaiden,fdmvmc1,t3_elxmbp,1578567903.0,"My UK tour shirt is as good quality as those fruit of the loom shirts get. I do wish we would get better quality for the price. The mark up on mass produced t-shirts is extremely high. That being said, I've probably worn it and washed it 50 times since I got it in 2018 and its still going strong,  but I think the black is faded a bit"
Hypothyroidism,fdjm148,t1_fdilaz1,1578477360.0,"Thanks,  I think that's the best course of action. I might as well fix one thing first, at least then I'll know which symptoms are caused by which issue"
Hypothyroidism,fdjlxh1,t1_fdit86y,1578477214.0,"It seems to be a big thing in my family, they all need injections."
Hypothyroidism,fdibl8k,t1_fdi62og,1578439271.0,I have to take 15000% of my b12 RDA a day in pill form. That's been happening since 18/12/2019
Needafriend,fd4o8hn,t1_fd4nkr8,1578169407.0,Ok please do
Needafriend,fd4mw4a,t1_fd4m4f1,1578169036.0,"Just wanting to speak candidly about loss, which is difficult with people who don't understand"
depression,fd45841,t1_fd44e14,1578164555.0,Very true.
ironmaiden,fd44abf,t1_fd3rfh3,1578164296.0,"Yes! I was thinking that. They're best stuff (in my opinion) came from their interest in history and literature. In fact they were a major influence in my love for history,  wanting to know the meaning behind songs."
ironmaiden,fd43y5y,t1_fd3uc0t,1578164193.0,"They are definitely taking every money making avenue there is it seems, but I'd like to hope that producing a new album will have nothing to do with how much they can make, as they have said themselves the amount they make from album sales is nothing compared to touring and merch."
ironmaiden,fd3gahh,t1_fd3g69i,1578158060.0,Would definitely love a new Eddie worthy of being my next tattoo!
ironmaiden,fd3e3yo,t1_fd3bqoi,1578157430.0,"I think the only shorter song they would do would maybe be an intro, but they tend to tack that on to the start of the first song now anyway"
ironmaiden,fd39k3u,t1_fd392zh,1578156038.0,"The thing is, they're not holding on to a talent they no longer possess, they are incredible live, they still have the skills, they have just largely moved away from what drew so many of us to them."
ironmaiden,fcx6b37,t3_eizgek,1578053018.0,"I'm so ready for a new album, seeing as they've been touring for so long they've actually had a lot of time together to make something epic."
Needafriend,fcor3tx,t1_fcopezf,1577839301.0,Well you're not alone. I'm here.
depression,fcnh5uy,t3_ei5g0j,1577811613.0,"Thank you, happy new years!"

Dreams,fc9672h,t1_fc952or,1577547670.0,"Well my husbands inquest is coming up and I will need to detail how I found him again to the court. I'm definitely afraid of losing myself,  never been worried about losing my boyfriend,  so I'm not sure where that came from"
depression,fc5s3t0,t3_eg9sk3,1577464633.0,This year has been nothing but death for me. I refuse to let it beat me.
depression,fc55v3k,t3_eg9ni7,1577444768.0,"The problem with death is that it is so final. My husband ended his own life, and without going into the gaping hole he left in countless peoples lives, I'm so angry that he didnt get to live. He could have done anything. He could of got on a plane instead and travelled somewhere. He could have quit his job and found employment that made him fulfilled, he could have had children, he could have done literally anything else. Sure, people wont always be happy with your decisions,  but you would be alive. 
Try everything before trying death. That's what I wish I could say to my husband."
depression,fc55kfg,t3_eg9qsd,1577444324.0,I think it would be a good idea to try. I've found that writing my thoughts and feelings makes it easier to articulate my thoughts when I do actually speak to people about how I feel
depression,fc55hqv,t3_eg9sgi,1577444210.0,"I suffered with it when my sleep quality was bad. Try to fill your awake time with a nice walk, exercise does wonders for sleep quality. Get out of bed as soon as you wake up to avoid unintentionally falling back to sleep, or staying in bed doing nothing for hours. Try to enrich your mind, maybe try some brain training or read or listen to a book. It might take a while before your sleep patterns are ""normal"" but you can certainly improve on 4 hours of awake time very quickly."
Needafriend,fc44t67,t1_fc44kui,1577406647.0,I'm glad

Needafriend,fc3fl0q,t1_fc3es2t,1577388709.0,Yeah I found my husband dead earlier in the year and now I've been made redundant from my job. Fun
Needafriend,fc3e8ue,t1_fc3dm2h,1577387861.0,"I've had the worst year of my life, maybe the only thing I can do to end 2019 right is to be kind and help where I can. I truly am here to listen"

relationships,fbxzlj6,t1_fbxzhd2,1577204519.0,"Yeah, definitely. It just doesn't feel like something he should just be able to do. No one else let's themself in."
