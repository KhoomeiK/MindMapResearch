This is a better broken down version of how I think of myself. 

I've been called smart by nearly everyone I've met in 2 decades. But given my recent failures, especially depression and anxiety, I always doubted people saying I'm smart. 

It's probably rude to disregard their observation. But I also cannot NOT say that they're wrong.

So when I get called smart, I just add a 'Thanks. But I'm yet to see if I have the wisdom to carry all that smartness.' 

Not sure if it's still rude. Have to socialise more to test this."
