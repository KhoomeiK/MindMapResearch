CX5,ffjrif2,t3_etz52s,1580005025.0,"Yeah the only time I used the touch screen is when the salesman showed me how to pair my phone. Other than that I’ve never touched it and I prefer it that way. 

Also it seems one of the big knocks people had against the CX5 was lack of paddle shifters. I prefer it without them, but I can see the use of them for some people.

Also the factory nav wasn’t very good. So that’s not much of a loss."
Porsche,ffij2mm,t3_etsce3,1579975065.0,It won’t void your warranty but you’ll need to keep documentation on what the other shop did (along with proof of OEM quality fluids and filters).
Porsche,ffgnk1f,t3_etij4o,1579910399.0,RIP your resale. That being said the exterior is nice. The red and brown interior kill it.
CX5,ffg0ghz,t1_ffg04xw,1579895785.0,It’s on Canadian ones. The disable button I believe is by the MMI. Porsche has it on the console.
Porsche,fffr5wu,t1_fffp8os,1579890009.0,Doesn’t sound too bad. It’s a lot of fluid. Like 7 or 8 liters IIRC and it’s expensive.
Porsche,fffb21v,t1_ffe7xsd,1579880019.0,Nothing wrong with the centerlocks.
Porsche,fffavz0,t3_et5y2d,1579879912.0,"Whichever you go with just use OEM fluid. For the love of god. 

Also make sure they’re changing the fluid for the PDK itself. A few DIYers have killed transmissions by draining and filling the wrong part of the trans."
CX5,fff8g3f,t1_fff5ln1,1579878314.0,"The amount of time the engine is off isn’t enough to damage the turbos from oil coking or coolant boiling. 

Lots of factory turbo vehicles use it.

Also depending on what market you’re in, your friends SQ5 likely has stop/start as I know the 19+ Macan has it (practically same drivetrain)."
CX5,fff8b3u,t1_ffdz3rm,1579878217.0,Wrong shifter. He was killed by a Grand a Cherokee which uses a somewhat common electronic shifter (similar to Audi). The issue was it didn’t have the failsafe that OP was complaining about in another post. He got out without realizing the vehicle wasn’t In park. This has been solved with a software update.
CX5,fff86c1,t1_ffdtlcc,1579878124.0,"But the CX5 does the same thing with the parking brake...... it’s a safety thing. 

Electronic gear shifters are common. It’s actually really good on the Jag/LR products, but they also were the first to do it mainstream. I can’t speak for the lower Chrysler products, but in the Ram it’s not bad either."
CX5,ffdn809,t1_ffbny78,1579824474.0,"It won’t. Modern starters are extremely robust. I thought this when these systems came out back in the late 2000s or so. But I’ve done fewer starters on vehicles equipped with this than I’ve ever done. 

That being said I’ve noticed batteries being more of an issue due to the requirements to maintain infotainment and climate control, but usually with battery management systems it’s become less of an issue. It’ll just disable the system if it thinks the battery is too weak to start it back up."
CX5,ffdmpjt,t1_ffd3eil,1579824161.0,Normal. Don’t need the dealer to tell you that. Dirt and dust accumulates in the gap between the light and body and when it rains or moisture otherwise gets in there the dirt comes out with it.
aww,ffc5g2o,t1_ffboe9s,1579791961.0,I think it’s supposed to be a squid.
Porsche,ffbr304,t3_esnkw8,1579779373.0,You’re about 12 hours late to cross post this.
Porsche,ffbnblq,t1_ffblj7b,1579773982.0,Matching FCC IDs won’t do anything.
