me_irl,ffcwz9f,t1_ffcvnzl,1579809011.0,"That’s only some of them, it’s not like every satanist believes in the same thing. Original Satanism as it originated from Left Hand Path is based on Zeus/Yahweh/Allah/Indra/Shu/the Father , which is explained in Liber Samekh, saying you focus on the mind of Zeus/Shu.  What these deities have very much in common most notably is that they are all flood deities and introduced animal and sometimes human sacrifices. Yes Zeus, Allah etc do not exist in our current space. Generally speaking the religions say Zeus was overthrown which also explains why the Abrahamic deity is no longer here. The Gnostics believe Jesus’ Father was Satan and that name to the Gnostics is Samael . Samael is the name Satanists will often refer to when referring to Satan , as well as “the Beast” which also comes from Gnosticism , which they call Yahweh/Samael/Satan the Lion Serpent Sun.

It’s like Lord of the Rings—Sauron was a 20-30 ft giant humanoid who had a physical existence. But then after his overthrow he changed his form into the eye of Sauron and became a transcendent metaphysical being that one could say does not exist."
