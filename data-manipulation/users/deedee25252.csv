He fell in a small hallway and I was essentially holding him ( after checking for neck issues and turning him over) trying to keep his bleeding under control. 6 large men and 2 huge bags of equipment came in got him hooked up and got him talking coherently. The space was so tiny that they had to transfer him to this cloth thingy. They somehow got it between him and I, lifted him off me, and out the door to the stretcher in no time.
