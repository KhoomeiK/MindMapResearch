offmychest,femna5f,t3_epxrvr,1579263489.0,That's great!!! Well done for pushing hard and never giving up despite what your teacher said! I hope you keep on pushing and good luck in the future!!!
offmychest,femlqx1,t3_epxeri,1579261715.0,That's so lovely!!!!!
offmychest,femlkwp,t1_femjwik,1579261515.0,"Thank you very much! And I know what you mean I don't think it's stupid talking to people but it's just I'd feel bad trying to put this on anyone as most people around me are probably having a harder time and they've all done more than enough for me, I did try to reach out to a friend yesterday but gave in, I'll try again. 

And I would honestly try a therapist but, due to some circumstances (not serious just sort of yeah) I'm unable to but I'll certainly try to reach out to someone again. Thank you so much again for listening to me and offering advice."
