What in the fuck does this mean? What distortions? More recent estimates actually suggest even more Chinese land is contaminated. To suit my argument?! What fucking argument? That the solution to this problem isn't the west's alone to solve?

Blaming the west when most Western nations didn't know about the severe ecological effects of industrialization until almost 150 years after the start of the industries revolution is kind of ridiculous. Especially considering that very industrialization was responsible for prolonging life expectancy and increasing the human standards of living by whole orders of  magnitude.

>That's not true either, but it's not even relevant.

What's not true? That the 3rd world has no responsibility to solve this problem? Or isn't constrained by treaties? How is *either* irrelevant?

US is doing a pretty good job. Why don't you look at carbon emissions over the last 20 years. US decreased its emissions by 12%. China's are more than double ours and rising  while India is set to pass us within a decade.

1. Freedom to own firearms comes at a cost that I think is acceptable.

And if that happens to be the case then it would make Joanna an ""anti-villain"" because while her motivation might be understandable and not really evil from certain points of view, she's not just killing Cardinal but all people Cardinal would likely have saved in the future.

As for military spending, I just don't see the relation. For one, there are very real strategic and geopolitical considerations for why the US needs the military that it has.
