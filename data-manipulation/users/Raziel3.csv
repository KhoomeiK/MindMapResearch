Antipsychiatry,fflqjwo,t1_fflog5w,1580042813.0,What do you mean exactly? Are you saying you feel like you have no soul?
Antipsychiatry,fflqeh0,t1_fflpoyr,1580042740.0,"I wish i could, but Im on a phone right now and dont know how to."
Antipsychiatry,ffl9022,t1_ffjkl14,1580036551.0,Like what?
Antipsychiatry,ffik926,t1_ffidsps,1579975871.0,Makes sense. People form points of view and they fail to recognize others so they treat them differently or in unhealthy ways.
collapse,ffiapy2,t3_etqwt5,1579969380.0,People at the top is why we re failing the workers.
organization,ffiaa0z,t1_ffi9v1e,1579969077.0,Thats very interesting. I feel like disorganized people may be less wanting or able to make connections so they re relaxed or vice versa.
Antipsychiatry,ffi5vhl,t1_ffi4p4t,1579965905.0,"No i dont think i can. Its going to take many people sending good supportive messages and bringing a shift in the mentality. Im just one voice in that and if i can help spread that message i would be glad to help

What larger structure are you refering to? Politics and economy?"
Antipsychiatry,ffi3kjl,t3_eorjme,1579964072.0,Thats interesting advice. It either gets you tossed away or locked up further.
Antipsychiatry,ffhyuf6,t3_et6kxe,1579959667.0,You re absolutely right. The docs are stupid and playing a very serious and wrong game. When what the patients really need is to rekindle their ability to learn and inject some lightheartedness into their life. Thats the cure to mental illness.

Buddhism,fff41qa,t3_etaukq,1579875138.0,Its not about some set destination. No wonder you are feeling lazy. Disorted thinking has sucked the energy out of you. Life is meant to be having fun learning.
PsychiatricFreedom,fff3jdw,t3_d8avks,1579874745.0,Well shit man thats just aweful. Life turns out like this because people dont learn. Relationships dont learn. Docs dont learn. We need communication and caring. And we need life to be lighthearted. Id try getting into games or buying a kit or something you can get involved in. Id demand lightheartedness and fun and relationships that learn from one another. Id esspecially encourage you to learn about the human spirit of learning. The childlike spirit. That is the path to wellness.
PsychiatricFreedom,fff2zcy,t3_e30rt9,1579874307.0,Life is getting too serious for you!!! The psychiatrists are wrong and stupid and dont have a flipin clue what we need. They should help you learn about yourself and it should be joyous.
PsychiatricFreedom,fff2osk,t3_e4havo,1579874075.0,It means she thinks you re going in all sorts of directions that conflict and she cant get a read on you.
PsychiatricFreedom,fff2fxw,t1_fb8eok3,1579873881.0,I totally understand. I know more than my psychiatrist about mental illness yet im the one being dictated to. Ya right.
YangForPresidentHQ,fff0t35,t1_fff0fl8,1579872532.0,Drugs cant cure it either. In fact they may cause it. Models of therapy are pathetically primative.
startups,ffenz9b,t3_eihab6,1579856636.0,"The learning economy

Just my bedroom

Theres all these problems in the world. Economic woes, complexities, climate change, long boring unhelpful education etc etc. I believe they all exist because systems are not learning friendly. My idea is to create a platform to promote learning to adapt to all the problems in the world and the economy. All the structures will aid in learning. 

Just me so far

Im looking for people who deeply care about the fundamemtal problems facing the world and willing to learn along with me. People who have website and programming skills would be esspecially useful and someone who knows how to manage money. Id like to find some people who are willing to learn with me how to pull this off and love it like a child, nurture it to life, and raise it."
Entrepreneur,ffehl4s,t1_ffcbcbt,1579848310.0,The only plan i have is to learn. It will be an economy based off of learning at every step of the way. That way it will adapt and change based on what it needs. All of my plans hinge on creating structures that allow this to happen. This will revolutionize education. It will take care of peoples needs. It will help out people making real positive change. Etc etc. It will not solve the worlds problems overnight but it will evolve to eventually.
YangForPresidentHQ,ffedh5s,t1_ffedaiz,1579844002.0,The sham is providing a product that also causes harm instead of seeking a psychological solution that isnt valueable to make a profit. The economy rewsrds those and fuels those that keep the people hooked.
YangForPresidentHQ,ffed8hr,t1_ffeczdd,1579843775.0,False. Psychosis doesnt always reduce functional thought. And when it is compromised why do you think that is.
YangForPresidentHQ,ffecuf1,t1_ffecn3g,1579843404.0,They also many times mess up lives and keep people dependent. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and let me tell you the docs dont have a flippin clue what they re dealing with. They are utterly ignorant. Let me ask you why do you think its an imbalance and what led to that imbalance?
YangForPresidentHQ,ffecf19,t1_ffebv3x,1579843001.0,Its the biggest ignorance in the world that doesnt understand psychology enough to understand why they have mental illness and think pills are what gets people through life.
YangForPresidentHQ,ffe8sd9,t3_et4wf6,1579839824.0,If psychiatrists new a damn about psychology and mental illness they wouldnt be pushing pills theyd be pushing for a better society.

findapath,ff6040w,t3_erpwmh,1579615664.0,Some kind of artistic psychological think tank
selfimprovement,ff5zhoe,t1_ff5y04t,1579615158.0,Drive comes from feeling well rested and then getting charged up about something you want to see changed. Burn out is fixed through stretching and lots if rest. Relax extend until you feel tension and then tighten and release the tension. This will make you more relaxed and less grogy and feeling disinclination. Then if you want energy you need to get your mitochondria pumping energy and to feel motivated. To stop procrastinating it takes caring. It means you value and expect certain things that mean something toward you and you re willing. When we procrastinate its because our direction and our will arnt in alignment. Until then tho i have to ask why you feel this is a bad thing. Not everyone is as energetic as others. So would activity in knowledge or more mental activities fit you better? Is society trying to get you to do things you dont want to do or is there something you would really like to do?
findapath,ff5yfkg,t3_erljet,1579614291.0,First of all you hate your life so you know you need a change. Some change. A change of surroundings a change of action or a change of mindset. This world isnt set up for everyone but i want to make people realize that there is a place for you and to support all the different personalities. It seems to me you have particular tastes and dont enjoy working so you fit into the realm of the critic. Trying products and giving direction to people in your niche of interest. Also you may fit into sone role as a knowledge worker. It depends if you like solving problens or not or designing things. Do you feel strongly about the injustices in the world? This whole area seems to be where you fit in somewhere. But i need more information. I really want to make this world more habitable for people like you and others who dont fit in. We can make this world better for all of us if we understand where we fit and help each other.
findapath,ff5x801,t3_erqz5k,1579613254.0,It less depends on your qualifications and more on your personality. Are you an explorer a builder do you love tech or stuff or do you like a simple life. Do you need to retreat from life. Do you like knowledge and information and solving problems? It really depends on what you need most in your life right now. Then once you figure out that you can figure out how what you allready know can fit into that.
nihilism,ff5vhao,t3_erpazl,1579611648.0,"Well you see depression is an energy drain. Being purposelessness means that your energy drain may be high therefore the two are associated. And you are right the mental health profession labels these things and trys to cure them with drugs. They are completely ignorant to the underlaying higher wisdom of it, so do not be fooled into following their ways to try to treat you and fix you. There is a reason you are like you are and its natural. The main point is if you accept or reject your current state and how you feel about it and what that means to you. You decide if there needs to be a shift that needs to happen not docs. And ultimately that shift does not need to happen through their limited world view. It can happen naturally through the right information and direction."
nihilism,ff5v267,t3_ero5wc,1579611245.0,Suicide is the only way out when you dont follow after heaven.
nihilism,ff5tyop,t3_erovjf,1579610148.0,Let me introduce to you the heavenly realm that fits you best. Its a place with just the bare minimum. Things are taken care of for you. There are no dopamine hits. But its also a very purposeful place. You see all the things in the world that are out of whack and take note of methods to resolve them. This information is then used to better the world and the universe. And when you re not doing that you re relaxing in bliss meditating and being at peace. Its an informative retreat and a very important role for the alignment of the universe.
NEET,ff5tmhf,t3_ertobb,1579609786.0,What this is about is leisurely consumption vs unbalanced work. Both sides hate each other but both sides are doomed to find the other side until we can learn to get along properly and recognize what we re all good at and help each other.
nihilism,ff5tc9h,t3_erdiq2,1579609482.0,It has a point. But the thing is it just starts back up again.
selfimprovement,ff5s276,t1_ff5rs4j,1579608065.0,Only way forward is to do some exploring. Go camping or take some tours. Go to a meetup. Try something you ve never done. Go to a theme park. Go to another part of town and walk around. Meet some people. Ask questions. Investigate things.

selfimprovement,ff5jyfu,t3_erfaax,1579596451.0,If you want to ascend you need to get a working and realize what it takes. If you really hate work tho to the point you reject that suggestion then you have to give up all your shit and stop accepting stuff unless you can do something and seek a buddhist path. Do things for others. Help out around the house. Be a decent good human being.
NEET,ff5jgt5,t3_ergak3,1579595751.0,The hate you feel is due to the imbalance of power of different personalities. The economy is arrogant and blind to other ways of doing things therefore the backlash. Its just how things work. Enlightened neets will see this and understand but you re right that it does no good. We need an uprising.
simpleliving,ff5goog,t3_ehxofj,1579592069.0,Dont feel guilty. Its perfectly fine to be you and you are of a different personality type of them. Q supporrive relationship with that personality type would be to work together on simple balanced projects. A unsupportive relationships would be for them to put their desires on you or for you to put your balanced mindset on them. That will lead to disharmony and cause conflict. You just need to find people who respect each other and come together on things that you would align with like exploring or simple balanced projects.
entrepeneur,ff5fmk5,t1_ff5fk5n,1579590762.0,No you dont. Im not the healhiest person to work. Just getting a job and fitting in with this economy doesnt fit my personality.
entrepeneur,ff5fbjd,t1_ff5f4zy,1579590394.0,"It may be that the economy was a nature reaction to the suffering, but we are still suffering because the forces in the universe arnt in alignment.

NEET,ff2drvb,t1_ff2cvox,1579502019.0,There are forces in the universe that harmonize and comppliment one another. Buddhism is one of those. Buddhism supports me and can support neets but thats not my role. My role is to be consious and buddhism supports me in doing that. Most Neets need buddhism. It compliments their frustrations perfectly. Theres a certain personality who is riddled with depression frustraion gloom hate tiredness. The personality is of the neets. Buddhism fits perfect to solve that problem. Yw btw :)
antiwork,ff2bwu0,t1_ff2be6d,1579500089.0,We need balance in the economy. The economy is currently one dimensional. You need two more components and an interaction between them to balance it out.

NEET,fexwog1,t1_fex0wrq,1579437698.0,Theism is a believe in god or gods. Im not sure what you have against theism? But theism is irrelevant to buddhism. Buddhisms utimate goal is to end suffering. Its to unbind and find peace. You can refuse to explore buddhism and that will mean you will not be saved or you can explore buddhism and that will give you the chance to find a refuge. But i dont know the state of your mind because you ve told me very little about yourself so it really depends on your state of mind to know if buddhism is a good fit.
