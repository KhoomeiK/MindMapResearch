AskReddit,ffj35e2,t1_ffi5vxw,1579989202.0,"I don't know, I think they did a number on Louises character. Like he became a plot patch. Very often he was the comedic relief and often represented as dorky which absolutely did not play with him being super smart lawyer. I know you can be super smart in one area of life and be completely oblivious to other walks of life but it was not well balanced in his character. He was a jerk, when the show needed a villian, then he was a dorky guy when the show needed a comedic relief, then he was super deep when there was a need for some emotionally heavy theme. Which on one hand could make for complex character but in the end it just became plot patch.

Also he was a bad looking because he was a villian. Which is another trope, the bad guys always are the bad looking ones, with exception of high school dramas, but even there they are more of the ""plastic"" beauty, which in itself contains something a bit repulsive.

Anyway Suits was on decline after the 1st series and the soap opera it became in the 3rd series was just shit. I have not felt like watching it after that, so not sure how it looks now after the Duchess left. Nor felt like watching the Jessica spin-off, I think the Mike-Harvey dynamic is what made it for me (in the 1st show). Let me know if it's any good, if you have happened to watch it, cheers."
