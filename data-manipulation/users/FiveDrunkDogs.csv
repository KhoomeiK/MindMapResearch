rant,fej8i20,t3_epfs9a,1579161453.0,There’s a feature to turn your location off. I agree with the chat thing and how it only lasts for 24 hrs. I wish there was an option to have it save forever so I didn’t have to go through and save every chat. I get the thing about the predator stuff they can just block you or unadd you and never have to deal with you again. Also I agree on it being originally for nudes it’s pretty clear with how it functions.
SuicideWatch,fed549r,t3_eojpkj,1578999325.0,"Yikes this is a familiar feeling. The only advice I can think of is super common but don’t give up thinking you’re not gonna make it to 18. I planned to off myself at 18 but now I’m just kinda existing and it just sucks. I’m not gonna lie you’re not gonna feel like aha adult yes I understand, the shitty feeling is just gonna stay or at least it has for me. Don’t skip on homework or trying for a job because what’s the point? I know I sound like a dumbass saying “just suck it up” but be aware of your feelings, know when you’ve had enough and take some time to breathe but don’t just give up on school or work because “I won’t make it as an adult”. I still think I can’t and it’s honestly just being taller and having more access to things. I suggest learning about taxes and bills and payments you need to make once you move out and getting a part time thing (volunteer work counts) so you have experience. I feel weird doing this because I used to hate adults who did this. Experience is the most important thing you can get as a teen. (I’m sorry this is so preachy and weird)"
rant,fed4li4,t3_eojiwk,1578998568.0,This sounds dumb but maybe writing things down or talking to someone about it so they can cut you off once you start to obsess over it too much? I try to remove my emotions from the situation to make my choices but that’s probably not the best
miraculousladybug,fdfh3g4,t1_fdfh05s,1578361543.0,I’m sure there is like a site called kiss cartoon or something but I’m not sure if it’s on there or if they update consistently
miraculousladybug,fdfgux3,t3_el4493,1578361388.0,I found some on YouTube but there’s a lot that skip scenes or end them really soon. Don’t go to playlists they don’t have them in order or all of the episodes. I just got a wiki and found the name of each episode of season three and then looked them up online
raisedbynarcissists,fddaszn,t3_ekpvsh,1578303044.0,I’m pretty sure there was a thing where a girl said she has seasonal depression (the girl was super pampered and said having all those things made her more confident and comfortable) and he said “ what is that? What do you get moody when it gets cold out?”. She went on to explain she doesn’t feel good about herself unless she’s dolled up and looking her best and he didn’t even address it...
SuicideWatch,fdcvo4z,t1_fdcv649,1578285640.0,I’m pretty sure an OD of any pill will be painful. I’m currently riding out an OD but my symptoms showed up within 20 minutes
SuicideWatch,fdcvhae,t3_ekoui8,1578285481.0,Maybe an ace bandage wrap and say it’s because you just hurt your arm stretching it or you fell off your bed
raisedbynarcissists,fd8kez3,t3_ekb81p,1578219436.0,I’m a women but for me it’s a ndad. Could’ve been a nmom if I lived with her
SuicideWatch,fd8i5gy,t1_fd8c4n0,1578218612.0,It might’ve been I know each pill was 500 mg and I took at least 100 of them but threw them up soon I also know 7k qualified for an OD
SuicideWatch,fcstsug,t3_eiq8h7,1577924921.0,Do you think you could ever tell your family what happened? To help put your mind at ease a bit? Maybe if someone you’re close to knew you’d be able to find comfort. I know you said you don’t want help anymore but reading these things hurt me so much I can’t help but try
SuicideWatch,fcqfqtd,t1_fcqdyfw,1577885161.0,I’m already dealing with a messed up amount of depression and anxiety and helping others is the only way I can really cope but with how bad I am at helping it’s just a mess and a half
SuicideWatch,fcqdvwi,t3_eihwx8,1577884056.0,I’ve started to write out replies and just backed out of them because I felt like I was guilt tripping them or pulling a “poor mee” move by saying it hurt to see things like that and I’d cry to know someone I interacted with even to such a small extent would off themselves and I couldn’t help
AskReddit,fcqdec5,t3_eic8yl,1577883788.0,I’d have the chance to prevent lots and lots of trauma but I’d lose my boyfriend because we met by luck and random chance...So no. I’ll take the years of trauma because even though I’m suffering still I’m making some small improvements and still have him with me.
SuicideWatch,fcq95xh,t3_eihp16,1577881370.0,My therapist told me on repeat anyone would be lucky to have me as a kid and I refuse to even think he would believe that if he knew me how I know myself. I really do hope you don’t go through with it though I don’t even know you and I’m worried for you and you may not believe that or even think I’m saying this cause I wanna be nice but hell I wish I knew how to help you
SuicideWatch,fcq7htc,t1_fcq6gk0,1577880375.0,You put yourself in such a negative light and I’m actually worried at this point. I know how dumb and useless everyone’s support feels or for that matter anyone’s support. I’ve no idea how to help here and I just genuinely hope you’re gonna be okay one day. I’m trying to word this without coming off as “boo me” or even coming off as guilt tripping while also explaining that I don’t even know anything about you but I know I’m worried for you. In my eyes as long as you haven’t hurt someone on purpose for no reason you’re a good person who deserves help.
SuicideWatch,fcq61o4,t1_fcq4tji,1577879521.0,Oof don’t comfort me too much or else I’m gonna get overly attached
SuicideWatch,fcq5ndq,t1_fcq5eas,1577879252.0,Mood. But no I know I can’t really offer comfort and I ain’t about to be responsible for an innocents death. I really do mean it when I hope you find comfort in something and can find a place where you can breathe comfortably
SuicideWatch,fcq5fl0,t3_eihbn8,1577879120.0,Trauma is different for everyone don’t let anyone tell you “haha that’s not bad”. That shit is the worst. My parents put me through that saying I didn’t suffer and it wasn’t that bad. Your emotions are valid please remember this I hope in a few years this will be behind you and you’ll be okay
SuicideWatch,fcq50yc,t3_eihcwv,1577878848.0,Christ I’ve gotten to the point where once I do it it’s all over and I don’t need to worry anymore. I’m worried about you and I know that doesn’t mean much but I wish I could do something to help you here.
SuicideWatch,fcq4vdd,t3_eihdd7,1577878749.0,I started seeing myself as a response to trauma and no longer a person with a personality and just replies and responses to my past. It helped me avoid caring so much. Seeing posts like these worry me and make me just want to comfort everyone but I can’t even tell if that’s really what I want or my response to my parents telling me to only live for others and never myself
SuicideWatch,fcq4b19,t1_fcq2c63,1577878411.0,My social anxiety really prevents me from making friends outside of my online ones. Where I’m from social anxiety and depression are considered a disability and since diagnosed in 2013 I’ve had to tell almost all my employers that I do have a disability and never get a call back. I considered disability benefits but there’s so much legal process I know Jack about and then it’s determined by some person if it’s actually preventing me from doing anything it’s just so much work and confusion. Everything is so confusing. I don’t understand taxes or insurance or any of that and my dad is rushing me to leave saying he has some girl in a different county and I’m preventing them from being happy until I get out I just need a minute to breathe but then I spend my time ignoring it all to not lose my mind and lash out at my family.
SuicideWatch,fcq3dzl,t3_eigp0p,1577877851.0,Christ I feel this. I tired to cope with making long distance friends or even making friends online. If you’re having trouble with that maybe try to read up on mental health to better understand what’s going on I hope everything goes over well for you
SuicideWatch,fcq31v0,t3_eigq1j,1577877645.0,In the end sometimes stuff doesn’t go away and we have to find a way to work around it. It’s good you’re working to get better if you’re able to I’d suggest you get someone or something you can find comfort in. It’s scary as hell to finally become an adult so I hope you can find some form of comfort in this.
deadbydaylight,f93g1pg,t3_e3idhx,1575058124.0,How do you even still have any left holy shit
