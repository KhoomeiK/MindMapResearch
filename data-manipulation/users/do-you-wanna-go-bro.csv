""Sophia! Can you come downstairs for a moment?"" A father yells up a stair case. He looks around at the blue walls. He wonders why everything in his house is blue. 
""Just a minute!"" Her bedroom door opens. ""What do you need?""
""Just come here!"" The father glances over to a lamp in the corner. Sophia walks down the stairs to greet her father. 
""What do you need?""
""Come give me a hug,"" Sophia hugs her father. He guides he towards the corner. With one swift move he grabs the lamp and hits Sophia over the head. Crimson color covers the blue carpet, making the carpet appear purple. She writhes around in pain as her father hits her again. Screams fill the room, but silence soon follows. 

A neighbor calls 911 after hearing the screams. 
""Something happened in the blue house on the corner!""
The police show up and there is no blue house. Only a purple house."
