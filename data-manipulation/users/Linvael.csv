Showerthoughts,fegghd2,t1_fegfemk,1579091969.0,"Relax. Take a deep breath. See what we're arguing about.

My point (or, well, the guy who started this comment chain) is **that rule of 2 working for a thousand years is a contrived plot point that shouldn't have been expected to work**. 

Supporting arguments for that involve showing possible ways things can go wrong, preferably with in-universe examples to show that's a thing that happens. Like my ""accidents happen, they're not immune to them"" point. Opposing arguments involve showing how in-universe logic would dictate that is in fact a reasonable course of action. Neither side is going to have a 100% proof because we're talking hypothetically, treating a made up story setting like a coherent universe that's not constrained by storytelling needs.

The fact that it actually works out in the plot as written is not really a valid argument in that discussion."
Showerthoughts,fege3sh,t1_fegddth,1579089518.0,"Force would make literally all the difference if and only if we never saw any force user die to non-force related issues. But we do. We know they're mortal, and ship they're on exploding would be just as deadly for a sith lord as it would be to random person. Precognition could explain success, but than it's not really rule of 2 that works, it's just that precog is OP.

If you want to go to ""literally the entire story of Star Wars"" we can go there and look at how apprentice (Vader) kills his master and than promptly dies himself."
Showerthoughts,fegd57f,t1_fefm3th,1579088402.0,"Engine exploding, life support failure, asteroid to the face. Low profile doesn't help against random events. And any infighting that did happen had a chance to end with both mortally wounded. 

As much as I agree that things like countries (or however you'd describe the Republic) are not generally that stable, they're much sturdier than individual humans."
skyrimmods,feczc66,t1_fecqnm6,1578990962.0,"Think of it as magic number that somehow relates to how the mod is saved internally. LE used 43 and SE uses 44. If you use 43 on SE it might work, but is asking for trouble. Creation Kit for LE saved mods with 43. Creation Kit for SE is able to open mods with 43 and change them to 44."

pcmasterrace,fdeo7sl,t3_eky8wh,1578343162.0,"It's worked for me for the past 3 years to do 1440p aiming for above 100 fps. Modern games tend to require more, but if you do high instead of ultra and expect 60 fps you should be fine"

philosophy,fd8ogzo,t1_fd6f7cs,1578220934.0,"That to me is the same argument as the one before - argument doesn't mention it now, but it does silently assume that perspective of the dead, or similarly wide abstract perspective is somehow more important than our own.

It does also assume that anything not permanent is meaningless. That if consequences of ones action don't outlast the universe than they're meaningless. That also is not self-evident and would require separate proof."
philosophy,fd6dly0,t1_fd6c9bo,1578189356.0,"Is there a stronger argument you have in mind than?  The question doesn't seem that hard, people don't want to die because they have values, preference for some states of the universe over other states and those can't be enforced if you're not alive."
philosophy,fd6ao04,t1_fd56knv,1578188082.0,To me this argument sort of begs the question of why should you choose the perspective of a dead you. Why should that perspective matter for an alive you.
skyrimmods,fd2whkh,t1_fd2qd2m,1578152249.0,"Using Legacy and Bruma should not be a problem, many people do that and are fine (if they understand the limitations the lack of official support brings). But using a patch made to reconcile Bruma with old version of Legacy, that's bad. 

How are you installing all that? Why do you expect old patches to get removed automatically when installing new ones?

Where is the modlist required by Rule 7?"

projecteternity,fcx9dly,t1_fcx5shn,1578056301.0,"The big classics I suppose:

\- Baldurs Gate - it started the genre if I'm not wrong, great plot, great games (sequel one much better than first IMO)

\- Planescape Torment - one of the greatest stories in gaming, heavily dialogue-driven, not great combat (if it's not ones cup of tea I would recommend cheating through combat just to experience the game)

\- Icewind Dale - basically more combat-oriented Baldurs Gate"
