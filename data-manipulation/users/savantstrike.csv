HomeImprovement,fefk0mo,t1_fedhxur,1579057953.0,"The well depth is probably their bigger concern. The well needs to be deep enough to reject heat into (or extract heat out of for heating). The vendor should have a table or a formula to determine how deep the well should be for your load, at which point if the well is any deeper then you'll just have higher efficiency. 

I think your instincts may be right. If you've got natural gas, the payback period is going to be longer (possibly infinite) unless there's a rebate or incentive program that drops the geothermal equipment price, or unless you need new equipment because of age. Also something to keep in mind is that if gas ever goes up, the electricity will scale with it since a huge portion of total capacity comes from peaking turbines.

Provided your house has average or below average insulation, you'll probably get the same or greater dollar savings for less money by insulating and air sealing the house (which is also an activity that usually has incentives or tax breaks).

Some states and municipalities are much more stringent when it comes to open loop wells, so you would need to make sure any system you go with is compliant.

You'll also want someone to do a load calculation to make sure your existing well is up to the task. Do the companies selling these products offer any guidance?"

That said, depending on the attached regulator it may not shut off if engulfed in flames (like in a wildfire). In that case you'll have the equivalent of a big torch burning until you shut the gas line off upstream.

I don't know what the breakpoint is to where a generator is warranted, but if you go with a generator they aren't instant on, so you need a UPS system plus a generator. You'll have a battery maintenance program as well as a generator maintenance program. It gets really expensive fast.

Most likey providers who do backup just provide 4-24 hours of battery power and plan to hook up a temporary generator when it goes beyond that point. It's easy enough to drop a generator off on a skid for the one tower out of many where local grid power is down that long."

1. Treat everyone on there like they just started going to your church. Give them an opportunity to say a few sentences and be polite. You'll have a better time, and so will they. Some people forget it's a human on the other end of the keyboard and do or say things I can only hope they wouldn't do in church (it's sad really)

It does all eventually boil down to God is sovereign. We as humans tend to try really hard to force Him into acting on our behalf, but He will act on His own timetable.

Remember that God is sovereign, so if even if at worst case you had to go to school part time to work more hours, He will still have His will be done. I've found that the high stress parts of life are where the most spiritual growth happens, and the experiences we gain during difficult times help our ability to witness to others when they have hard times. There will probably come a day when you'll be ministering to someone who has hit troubled financial times and you will be able to tell them about what you're going through today, and they will be comforted by your words.
