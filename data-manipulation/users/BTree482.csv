However have you tried progesterone treatment?  You take them starting on day 14 through day 29.  Dr Herzog in Massachusetts has done a study and I believe there articles he has written.  

My wife is working through the treatments but has not gone as far as the Lupron.  The side effects can be bad."

It's challenging and can be done anywhere.  Just get a camera (I prefer not to use a phone cam) and go for a walk.  Take some pics.  Relax.  Search for Street Photography and you will see what I mean.
careeradvice,ffy05gf,t3_evsedn,1580335898.0,"It depends on what sized company.  Large companies typically have c-suites spots filled by very experienced senior leaders (in their late 40's to mid 50's or older).  They have worked their way up through years of experience in the company or by working in several companies.   Smaller companies can have younger less experienced c-suite employees but it really depends.  

There isn't really a typical path to the c-suite but you can do certain things to increase your chances.  If you are interested in the typical path to get to the c-suite pull some job descriptions or biographies in the industry you want to work in and see what their experience is.  Also, if you have a degree in Neuroscience you might want to plan for an MBA to round out your business training, etc.    

Also, I would ask why you want to reach the c-suite level?  Money? Fame? Power? Making a difference?  Leading a company?  What is your motivation to want to get there?  The quickest way to be in the c-suite of a company is to start one yourself (or be part of a founder team)."

One way to think about it is to treat yourself as you would your best friend.  When your best friend screws up you help them out right?  When was the last time you did that to yourself when you made a mistake?  For me anyway, thinking of things in that ""best friend"" context really helped me.  I am not perfect but I am doing the hard work to make good choices and be a great human being."

careeradvice,fftj9kl,t3_ev63oc,1580222008.0,I always notice who on my team goes.
careeradvice,fftihg1,t3_ev63oc,1580221429.0,"In my experience, it's not a good thing to skip.  There should be a lot of prep going into those meetings and they are doing them to get everyone on the same page.  Sometimes they can be boring (maybe in the future offer to help make them more interesting?), but it's important to hear the message.  Also, it's good to NOT be on your phone during them; be engaged.  Try and learn 1 or 2 things in the meeting.  They should be providing some bigger picture topics that in your current role or group you don't see.  So many times people complain the meetings are a waste of time but typically that's a narrow view not seeing the bigger company view of things.

Also, If you don't show up people may notice and not ask you why you didn't go, but they may ask your boss.  If your boss's team doesn't show up, or they show up and stare at their phones, your boss looks bad.   You don't want to make your boss look bad."
careeradvice,ffthyhs,t3_euzwgt,1580221031.0,"What area of Finance are you interested in?  Working in the Financial Industry (what positions?) or working in a Finance group within a corporation?  If you haven't already look at some jobs that interest you in the future (not an entry position but further out in the future) (e.g. you want to be a CFO or you want to be a mutual fund manager?) and look at the requirements in the job description/posting.    That would give you a sense of a path to those jobs including Masters, MFA, and other certifications.   

Also, I hear so often people thinking that going to school for a degree is the answer.  In my opinion, it is much better to start with a good job (e.g. if you have an undergrad degree in business, finance, etc. already) and then go for an advanced degree while you are working.  In the US many companies help pay for school and even though it could take longer to achieve the degree you are working at the same time so its less risk than going full time and coming out two years later maybe during a recession...  The exception to this would be if you can get into a top 5 MBA program like Stanford, Harvard, etc.  They might be worth the risk."
jobs,ffth29a,t1_fftf09p,1580220336.0,"Its out of your hands now.  It may take longer than you want but stressing or obsessing about it won't improve the situation at all.

They have to run the company too.

However I do try to lean into my emotions about why something is stressing me out.  Really dig in and find the root to where it’s coming from.  In the moment though I remind myself it is just thoughts.  Recently I had an issue that I was irrationally stressed about.  I used the 5 whys and broke it down (just keep asking yourself why).  It really helped me realize what elements I could control and then work on those.  It removed the stress.  The key was meditation taught me the skill to see it was just thoughts, to pause, not attach, and lean in to learn more."

Sounds like the manager wants you on his permanent team, so he should be willing to fight to get you more money.  I would.  If the manager likes you and doesn’t want to lose you it can work out.  I think it would be strange for them to ask you to go for the job and then remove your contract if you asked for more money... but you never know.  However would you be taking on more responsibility with the perm role?  That should usually mean more pay.

School stuff only matters if I have something to talk to you about (eg we want to the same school or sports) or you went to a top 5 school like Stanford or Harvard.  Ironically if you did go to a top 5 school and I am seeing you for a position (in accounting) that most likely means you suck.

Also, practically speaking I use the Pomodoro method for tasks (build a Pomodoro board in Notion) to organize my tasks.  I have A LOT of meetings (eg 13 30 min cycles in a day) so I put those as a task and schedule the cycles,  on days that are full of meetings then I am ok not getting a lot done.  I used to feel bad but now it makes total sense.  Also, I block my calendar two weeks in advance to free up time to do work other than meetings.  Also gives me the option to remove blocks if needed but it’s been essential to have control over my schedule.  My admin colors all the blocks so I can tell what is open vs meeting vs blocked time scheduled for a task.  Point is, work to get a system that works for you."
Epilepsy,fffifg6,t3_et6b17,1579884646.0,"Welcome.  Sounds like you are off to a good start, and it's good you aren't driving.  I don't have epilepsy, but I support my wife who does (25+ years now).   I would suggest doing some reading in advance of the Dr. appt you have scheduled.  Including from CURE and the Epilepsy Foundation.  I personally like CURE better and their email newsletter has been really good lately.

 [https://www.cureepilepsy.org/](https://www.cureepilepsy.org/)  

I don't want to scare you but not sure if your Dr. has discussed SUDEP (Sudden Death in Epilepsy Patients), and the risk of death from seizures (1 in 1,000 patients or 1 in 150 with intractable epilepsy).  There has been a lot of misinformation out there, many doctors have only recently (last several years) been discussing it with patients, so IMO it would be a good topic to discuss with your Doctor.  Also, related to that it is REALLY important not to miss any doses of your medication.  Patients have missed doses then had a seizure and died.

You mentioned that you have autoimmune and adrenal issues.  My wife has Lupus and thyroid issues.  It took us 7 years for us to figure out that her thyroid sped up the absorption of the medicine so she wasn't getting enough anti-seizure medicine throughout the day.  Therefore, more seizures so we adjusted the meds and it improved a lot.  

Anyway, glad you found this Reddit group.  There is a lot of information here so feel free to ask questions."
jobs,fff2q0h,t3_et9bm6,1579874101.0,"Yes, most things are negotiable.  However, it is up to you how important it is.  As you mentioned, you would take the perm job without a pay increase.  If that matters to you a lot more than a bit more money then try and get the perm job.  However, if you think you will be resentful after getting the perm job and are willing to take the risk of asking then it most likely would be worth the risk.  It all depends on how comfortable you would be with the decision.  What does your gut say?   Also, what are the typical annual merit increases each year for perm positions (e.g. 3%)?  How does that compare to the increase you wanted to ask for?  Waiting a year and you could get the annual increase.

Also, as a hiring manager, I would always value a successful contractor converted to perm then just hiring unknown perm... if you are doing well then they should be excited to convert you and then hire a contractor to backfill your old role."
Meditation,fff27g1,t3_esyrzh,1579873693.0,"I think meditation is more about seeing the snow and not labeling the snow as good or bad but just seeing the snow as snow.  By not labeling the snow, either way, it is just snow and therefore I won't just react to seeing snow as good or bad.  Without meditation, you could habitually react and say ""Ughhhh snow to move out of the driveway""  with meditation it is just snow so if anger, anxiety or other strong emotions about the snow comes up... I can now see they are just thoughts and snow is snow.  For me that has been the huge benefit of meditation."
selfimprovement,fff0y8d,t3_et8uht,1579872653.0,"One thing you can do to help build self-confidence is to not avoid the anxiety and fear in hope that it goes away.  Instead, get closer to your fears and anxieties, break them down and try to understand them really really well.

For instance, what is happening when you feel less confident?  At work?  Social interactions?  What type?  What scenarios?  Keep breaking it down to understand all the details.  Then look at those items that give you issues and try to find ways to improve them.  Also, knowing your triggers of self-confidence issues helps as well.

For example, a common one that people have are big presentations or meetings at work... why are you not feeling confident?  Fear of looking stupid in front of colleagues or the boss?  Why?  In what areas do you feel stupid?  Can you intensely prepare and learn in those areas?  If its public speaking... take a class, practice, practice, and practice.  Also, in many cases doing more of the things that you are less confident can help... instead of avoiding do more and build it into a strength."

Sales job maybe where they expect you to sell... also you are interviewing them as well.  In an interview if I can’t have a good conversation with the people hiring me I would pass.  Imagine what every day at work would be like?  

However, if they gave standard canned answers about the company you can always go into questions about them.  For example
- how long at the company?  If long time asked why they stayed.  Short time why did they choose to work there
- why did they choose to be in x field?
- Ask about the culture...what is a typical day or week like in the group?
- also if you are in their office... scan the room and look for things of interest or in common with you (where they went to school, kid pics, art, travel photos, book on shelf) basically anything to discuss
 - if the company sells products ask what is their favorite
- where do they see the company going in 5 years.. I asked that once and the guy said they would sell if stock hit x$... that answer I passed on an offer because if they sold I could be at risk... two weeks after I would have started... hey got that price and sold.  Glad I didn’t take the offer."

I didn’t spend a ton of time on the site but I was looking for an easier way to see how it works.  For instance, a Start here section that walks through step by step how it would work.  If you are asking for me to use my data in your tool I would want to understand that first.  

Also, building trust with me is essential before I upload anything from my business.  Free is nice but the trust is costly.  My business is not small but putting myself in a small business mindset I might want to see a demo with other data first.  

For instance, providing a sample data set for a type of company that would use it.  Let me use your fake demo data to run through the tool first to see how it works.  Then if I liked it I would contact you to see more.  Also a videos in your use case section would be nice too (Accountants use it xyz with a quick video, sample data, etc)."

As mentioned below it is not about stopping your thoughts but identifying them as ""thinking"" and not attaching to them.  Over time this nonattachment to thoughts on the cushion translates to events during the day.

For example for me, high emotion and anger issues for me.  Over time I learned to see them as just ""thoughts"" then I don't react to them and can pause long enough for a nonhabitual response.  HUGE improvement.

If you don’t talk it makes everything harder.  

Also, anyone that says it must be everyone else and not themselves would concern me if I were leading your team.  The only thing you can control is yourself even if it is just your reaction to difficult people and situations.  Saying repeatedly it’s others tells me it is most likely you.

Reflecting and finding why things are hard for you now can help you not repeat the same mistake the next time or hopefully make a change now and improve your current situation.

\- Block for 30 mins from 8:00-8:30 - I have this setup recurring to train people not to book that time in my calendar for meetings.  I use this to catch up on my news feed, any hot emails, and plan my Pomodoro cycles for non meeting times (e.g. top 2-3 things to do that day).

\- Mid day checklist (free time like morning checklist) - similar to the morning checklist it is a reminder of my affirmations to help me stay focused mid day.

\- Evening checklist (free time like the others) - Includes a quote and things to focus on as I head into my evening to remain focused on winding down from work and up into the evening (Gym, guitar, Dinner, time with wife, then sid hustle and book reading before bed).

I think it all depends on how you work.  For some people my list above is wayyy too much structure.  For me it works great.  Try some things and see what works for you."

What went well this week?

What didn’t go well?

What two or three things am I grateful for?

What two or three things did I learn?

What will make next week better?

You love your job, etc and the change hat happened really threw you for a loop and you acted in a way that is not yourself.  Apologize and mention that it was unprofessional, not the way you show up, and hope that you two can both move on and you will work with this new person and support them.

The thing is you can’t control what other people do.  Only yourself.  You can’t stop the boss hiring the guy.  Also it’s not the new guys fault either.  However, people have bad days and if you have a good relationship with the boss it could be ok.

However do you really want to stay?  Sounds like it’s not a great fit and you are undervalued.  It’s easy for me to say leave he company or at least the group but I know it’s harder than that.  Also, if you stay there but want to work for someone else I think it would be best to try and patch things up with the boss first.  Then move to another group."

I mention this because it does get better but it can take a long long time.  

After all of this in retrospect I have to admit that his death was actually in a strange way a good thing for me.  I honor his memory by being a better person, learning life is short, making better choices.  If he hadn’t died I am not sure I would have changed or not changed as much.  I am a better person (husband, son, friend, worker, leader) because of the tragedy and all I learned having gone through it.  So much so that I can’t imagine life without that event happening.

If she needs a blanket, wheel chair, wound treatment, etc I ask repeatedly until we get what we need.  If we want her to have adivan or not I manage that.  The ERs in our city are super busy with all kinds off issues and life threatening problems and unfortunately a seizure with a gash is not top of their list.  Also, they see a lot in the ER and until they confirm you have epilepsy they are seeing a woman with a gash on her head (abuse?) and maybe a seizure (drugs?).  I always assume they are too busy to deal with us and work with them to try and get what we need. 

Also, my wife and I have discussed what we want to do in the ER in advance so I know how to speak for her when she can’t.  She keeps an updated list of her meds, doses and times in her iPhone so I can use that with the ER staff.  Their computers are ALWAYS wrong, and we have learned she needs nongeneric seizure meds so we have that with us as well.  Anyway, in our experience over the last 25 years of this, we have to manage it all to make sure it works out.  Not in a super aggressive way with the staff (unless it’s really really bad) but we show up prepared and organized so we can tell them what’s going on, her history, etc.  Then they can be more efficient and effective delivering care."

It is part of the journey.  It will never be 100% complete or figured out so instead learn to be comfortable with where ever I am.

selfimprovement,fdqnude,t3_emo5bn,1578671039.0,"In Buddhism (the way of life not the religion), there is the concept of Maitri which is practicing loving-kindness for yourself (and then others).

They are not religious but more discussing what to do.    


Essentially the idea is to treat yourself like you would a good friend, and in fact work and practice becoming a good friend to yourself.  For example, if you did something you are beating yourself up about... if your best friend did that... what would you say to them?  How would you treat them?  Most likely not as hard as you treating yourself, so when those events occur remember that and treat yourself like your best friend in good and bad (forgiveness, love, compassion, etc.).   It takes time but with focus and practice, you can and should love yourself more than anyone.  Not in a selfish way but how can you love and forgive others if you can't love and forgive yourself?"
jobs,fdo4cwv,t3_emd6ta,1578598669.0,"Do you want to (or capable of) being the supervisor?  If you think you want the job then it might be worth proving yourself in the interim that you can do it.  Also, if you think you will be ready in a year or so then you should try and get the job IMO.  Otherwise, the new person coming in could be a block to your future growth (e.g. 1 year from now when you want to get promoted you can't because the new person is there.).    


Assuming your boss liked your supervisor that is leaving they may be stressed about the change.  You can help the boss by being a trusted resource that can solve this transition problem.  If you want the job and think you have the skills to do it then I would pitch that to your boss.    


As part of that pitch, I would talk about who on the team could pick up part or all of your current work.  Come prepared with at least one or two names of who YOU would want to do your old work, and more importantly who you would not want to do it (e.g. you don't want to get stuck with people you don't want, etc.).  The benefit to them is they know you, you know them and the company, and can help have a smooth transition to take the supervisor work, and transition your work to the team.  Then you can hire your replacement.    


If you don't want the job then there may not be a lot of good in this for you to take on more than 1 person's worth of work.  In that case, you can take the risk of sucking it up and not being great at your current work or the new work you now will have... you could ask to get help from other team members and in that case again give some names you want and try to avoid the ones you don't.  Also, try and give the work you are least happy with (or least important) to the interim people.

I hear a lot of people in this situation mention school as if its the only option.  It usually isn't unless you really have a passion for something, know the path (that includes school), and you go for it (e.g. becoming a Doctor or Lawyer).  If you are uncertain, IMO, the commitment and investment (time, and money) is a big risk if you don't really know what you want to do.  


Instead, I would suggest sitting down when your mind is clear and thinking about what you want to do.  Couple suggestions to start with:  
\- What work do you love   
\- More importantly what work do you hate?  
I don't necessarily mean industries but what type of work... project work?  Routine work?  Transactional work (bank type work), work interacting with people?  Not with people?    
\- What are some of the jobs that you see in the world that you would love to do now or sometime in your life?  Or what people do you see in your life that you like what they do and would like to do it?  
\- For the jobs you have seen.  Do a google search for the job description.  Compare the requirements to your current skill set.  How close are you?  Still passionate about the job and the work it may entail?  
\- What are the things you are good at or people close to you say ""wow you are sooo good at that?""  Do you like doing those things?  Is there a job for those?  
\- What are the things on your own time that you love to do or you when you do them the time passes and you have no idea the time went by?  Is there a job for these?

Taking time off to broaden your life experience can be a great thing to talk about to a hiring manager.   For instance, saving up, planning, and accomplishing a van trip for a year in New Zealand?  Awesome.  Burnt out, took time off to get in shape, learn new skills, go to weddings.Also good.  Sitting in the couch and playing video games (unless you are a game develop) not so much.  What is the story you have to tell about your time off?

Also, a hiring manager may wonder if you would do it again.  Explaining how the circumstances at the time made sense and how you are now not making a habit out of it will help.  No hiring manager wants to go through the effort of hiring and training an employee only for them to leave.  Also, the hiring manager may have to defend your career gap to other people on the interview team (HR, other interviewers, maybe their boss).  You want to them to have good info to defend why they should hire you even with the gap.

One last thing. Not that you would but I recommend not lying about it.  Be honest and tell the story.  A career move is like a relationship and IMO you don't want to start off with a lie that you would need to then keep up for hopefully a long period after that (and it's wrong).

I have personally gone through this at least three times.   In my opinion, the key before you decide to leave is to understand what is really driving your frustrations and how are you are contributing to them.  You listed a bunch of things that are going on the company but in my experience, it is REALLY important to understand your last paragraph about not finding joy anymore in what you do.  If you don't look into understand that then issues can cascade from there.    


For instance, what job(s) would you apply for?  
What questions would you ask in an interview to evaluate culture fit so you don't go into a toxic culture?  
How do they fit into your overall future life?  
Have you thought about where you want to be in the future?  


 If not then how do you help make sure that you don't end up in the same situation again?  Poor management, poor leadership, toxic work environments, upper management not available.  These are all common things that happen at almost all companies, and while you are deciding what to do you can learn a lot of things about how to deal with them now.  That learning can help you when that situation comes up again at the next place.  For instance, how did you the toxic work environment come about... what were the triggers... did you miss them this time?  Maybe next time you won't and can deal with them better, etc.  If you are planning to leave, maybe take more risks building relationships with upper management and voicing your concerns... it really depends on the situation but understanding the specifics what can you do to help fix the issues.  It may not work but you may be on the way out so why not learn some things in the process.  


I would suggest taking 20-30 mins to:  
\- 10 minutes to list ALL your frustrations  
\- 10 mins to pick the top 3-5...   
\- 10 mins+ look really hard at understanding those top frustrations and what YOU can do to solve them and find your joy again.  


You may be surprised and want to stay in your current company, job, or work you do.  Or most likely you will have a lot more information to think about how best to seek the change you need to find that joy again.
