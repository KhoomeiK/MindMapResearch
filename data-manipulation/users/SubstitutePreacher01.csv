selfhelp,ffm5q0f,t1_ffl54il,1580048930.0,Thank you man. I'm glad there are people out there that I can relate to about this.
selfhelp,ffk6ccy,t1_ffk1zzg,1580017322.0,You're right man. I can feel it In my bones that's how I would act and I hate it. I want to change. I'm going to check out this article you sent. Thank you for the help brother.
selfhelp,ffk69yi,t1_ffjvg1d,1580017258.0,I actually have the book too. I know exactly what you're talking about. Haven't read too much of the book yet but I did read a bunch of articles on limerence
OCPD,ffjd0j1,t3_et8d6u,1579995702.0,Yeah that sounds like OCD to me. Seems like alot of number specific things
offmychest,ffiotw6,t1_ffioo0t,1579979020.0,The therapy did help before. I appreciate you taking the time to reply and try to help out. Maybe I will try to go back to that. Thank you
offmychest,ffiopss,t1_ffil4iz,1579978941.0,I do try to distract myself but that also just makes me feel like I'm avoiding the problem. Like it's still there and I feel shitty about it.
offmychest,ffiok1s,t1_ffilalz,1579978831.0,This is exactly what I did with the first girl I obsessed over. My obsession came to a head and I took an indefinite break and still haven't spoken to her in probably almost a year now. Sure it's been better but it just feels like I'm avoiding the problem. Am I also going to just repeat this process with every girl I have feelings for that doesn't reciprocate?
Minecraft,ffi06ch,t3_etn8ko,1579961012.0,That's so awesome

Meditation,fffdcda,t3_etaivc,1579881467.0,I'm happy for you man. I dunno how you did 5 hours a day. Kinda crazy to me. But I'm glad it's helping you. I was diagnosed with anxiety and ocpd and so I do get jittery when i sit for a long time but meditation has definately helped. I can usually do 20-40 minutes a day. Usually 20 in the morning and 20 before I go to bed. 5 hours is incredibly impressive. Good on you man

offmychest,ff6cfzz,t3_eru1na,1579624164.0,"Yeah when I was in elementary school I would get bullied alot by a certain group of kids and whenever I would snap back at them they'd say I had anger problems? Which of course made me more mad. Same in high school but not as much. I say fuck em, stick up for yourself. But also keep your head"
DetroitBecomeHuman,ff29651,t1_ff0oe9o,1579497494.0,"On the topic of no choice, always bugged me when Connor finds the deviant in the house who killed his master and it seems like you'll get a choice on whether or not to bring him in but you don't at all. Just always bothered me"
DetroitBecomeHuman,ff249gm,t1_ff1bso5,1579493390.0,Yeah second half of the game for just about every character is way more intense and gripping and makes up for it for sure
DetroitBecomeHuman,fezul2j,t3_er0olk,1579461852.0,"Definately, absolutely the chapter where Markus goes to find Jericho. Holy fuck it's so boring and dumb and unnecessary. Imo at least the zlatko mission has some heart pumping moments and you get to go search for Alice after the mind wipe thing. To me that mission is kind of like a side quest where you gain a follower lol"

dyinglight,fekicti,t3_epibgc,1579200658.0,Lmao the kicking it at the end
coldshowers,fej3cre,t3_ep99ax,1579155355.0,Yeah I always listen to some good tunes. I think it's the adrenaline from the cold ass water. I totally agree though it makes the music more epic
Meditation,fehkay2,t3_ep1yu4,1579118281.0,Thank you for this post. This is great. I was diagnosed with OCPD and I definately obsess over anything that seems to be the issue at any given time. I related alot to this post. I will definately try to live my life this way and already have been to a certain extent but it's hard sometimes. I'm going to keep trying at it. Thank you again
OutoftheAbyss,feh77ob,t3_ep3yc4,1579110588.0,"I'm currently running this campaign and have only just now gone through Sloobludop. But what I have done is made character sheets for the remaining NPCS In the party and let the pc's play as them as well as their own characters. It makes combat more fluid as the players actually get to play more and don't need to wait for me basically fight myself as the npcs and enemies fight each other. It lets the pc's actually play more and everyone's been loving it. I have no advice for the army unfortunately. I'm not looking forward to figuring that out either. 

Good luck to you Though dude"
