If there is someone who cares about all life, including plant life, vegan diets 'kill' fewer plants than omnivorous/carnivorous diets. The animals we eat also need to eat. Fewer plants would die if we just fed 8 billion humans versus 8 million humans plus 150 billion large land animals.

In fact, we could end world hunger many times over if most humans went vegan.

It would probably make someone uncomfortable if an individual decided to kill a dog for a meat-brurger instead of taking the plant-based one offered to them. Because we know their life is worth a lot more than that.

For many it is necessary to travel with these methods in order to survive. They need it to get to their work place so they can feed themselves or their family, they may need it to reach medical care, and so on. But just like it's 'necessary' to eat chocolate, it's necessary to eat animal products. In the first-world it doesn't need to be done.

Who said veganism was free of pollution, or animal death, or animal suffering in fact? It's about where practical and possible. Because it's better than nothing. Meat farming causes severe pollution from waste run off, the contamination of local water and springs, ocean dead zones, Amazon fires, extinction of species, global warming, and so on.

Not to mention that with the production of meat more crops need to be grown world wide in order to feed these billions of large land animals. More transportion needs to be used, more unfair labor. It's so energy inefficent that we could end world hunger many times over if land was used for plat-based production to feed 8 billion humans, rather than 8 billion humans and 150 billion land animals.

The animals are processed very quickly and many times the stun does not work. They're (cows) hung up and have their throat slit alive and conscious. If it's a pig, they'll likely be put in a gas chamber where the gas burns them inside out as they scream and trash so violently that their hooves fall off. Other pig slaughtering methods include slitting their throat and then boiling them in hot baths to remove hair off their skin. A lot of pigs are still alive through the process. Similarly, this is done to chickens so their feathers are easier to pluck out. And again, many are still live as this happens.

This is all done while the other animals watch, they smell the death and fear around them, they try to escape, but of course they can't.

Science is not on your side regarding veganism and health.

Position of the American Dietetic Association: vegetarian diets.
""It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.""

vegan,fesl27v,t1_fesi1nd,1579366337.0,"Yes people live differently to others all the time. There are cultures who think that women are second class citizens, that torturing and eating dogs is ok, that littering is ok if it's convient for them, that sticking their hand up a cow's ass and uterus while she's strapped down in a rape rack is ok because milk.

The difference is that once there's a victim it's not just a matter of personal choice. It's something that needs to be discussed in extent."

I wish I could remember the name of the dish I ordered, it was great. My uncultured self would describe it as a 'make your own vegan taco with a bunch of sauces, spices, and sides'. The atmosphere was pretty nice too, especially if you're seated at the bar/center isle where I was.

If you go let me know if you like it :)"
