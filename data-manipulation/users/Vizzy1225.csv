The worst that can hapoen is you decide go cut contact like you originally were, and the best is an improved relationship and understanding with your parents"

AmItheAsshole,fdre2hs,t1_fdr4fh2,1578683138.0,"Thats different. I am lactose intolerant and my husband has a horrible joint disability. Some days he can walk and even run, some days he cant. However, he doesnt choose how he feels. He has zero choice in the matter.

I do. If I choose to ignore my lactose intolerance, that is 100% choice. And I do that frequently, escpecially with ice cream. Since I do frequently ignore my lactose intolerance, it would be unfair to my husband if he bought me ice cream and I got mad. I dont think it was 100% fair to the wife ***if*** he consumes dairy a lot. Thats picking and choosing too much."

rpghorrorstories,fdqlyzr,t1_fdn85pn,1578669838.0,"Min/maxxing your own character is one thing, trying to min/max everybody else is another. Your character can be a dick, as long as *you* aren't a dick. It's a fine line I suppose.

An example was when my party was dealing with a King. We suggested he do plan A to deal with nearing Orcs, but he did plan B. He won the battle, but probably lost more lives than needed. The other players wanted to keep their relationship with the King. My character was snooty, mad, and not willing to talk to the King herself, but I didn't in anyway stop or prohibit them from talking with him. She would wait in the hall or talk to somebody else during these times. My character was done talking to the King, but went along with the party if they made a deal with the King or otherwise was doing something involving him. It wouldn't be fair to my friends if I just refused every quest line having to deal with him. I just had my character react accordingly when doing a quest for a guy she thinks is an asshole.

I would say your PC was okay in convincing them not to fight the NPC (not great to meta, but I guess we all do it every once in awhile), except he did it for *over and hour* and probably did a lot of other things that inhibited their fun."

Cringetopia,fdoo809,t1_fdnmod8,1578609194.0,"I chalk it up to if my folks or people will notice the unusual thing (bringing you same-sex partner when they assume your straight), then its something reasonablw to tell. Unless your siblings or parents will see you during sex times, it is not necessary to tell them about it"
rpghorrorstories,fdn5rs4,t3_em73u4,1578578063.0,"Okay, I have played a character like this. It all depends on how you do it. My character min-maxxed, but she was a perfectionist. Everything had to be perfect, and it was never her fault if it went poorly; *she* did things perfect, how could it be her fault? We decided she spent 10%-20% more time on things (excluding instant spells and the likes) but she would do it better in one way or another.

If you're character min-maxxes, there better be a reason and it should come out in gameplay. My character butted heads with generals and captains who wouldnt do it her way, and would be slightly unhappy if she didnt have a say in the plan (she still did it, or that would be unfun to the table)."
rpghorrorstories,fdn1wx5,t3_elz0mn,1578574793.0,"In my campaign there is no PvP with combat. If anything happens between my PCs, I make sure both parties are okay, then I tell them it is between them. If the Rogue is wanting to lie to the Paladin, they can either RP it out or roll, whatever it is - they figure it out. The most I will do is declare what rolls what if requested.

Luckily I have very good PCs, and we have been playing for half a decade together, so I can trust them."

college,fd31aup,t3_ejvbbt,1578153815.0,"Here is overall advice: you will figure it out. I am gojng to be a senior and the amount of times I have switched majors is incredibly. I started with neuroscience with a minor in psychology, switched to nutrition, switched to environmental health, and I finally landed on Biology of Disease with a minor in environmental health. Over 80% of students switch majors.

Talk to career coaches and academic advisors. Your first year and a half you will only be taking basic classes that are required for most degrees. You will be exposed to a lot of different subjects, take that time to assess what you do and dont like. I learned quickly I hated psychology and I actually kind of liked math, despite my hatred for it in highschool."

AskReddit,fc1f5hf,t1_fbzwacu,1577316915.0,This is one thing I am very thankful in America. Whenever I do a road trip talking to the locals is amazing and is a major part of the trip; people in America are extremely receptive. I have talked to old ranchers about their entire life. When I went to Italy and tried to make small talk nobody would talk to us. Especially around Rome.
