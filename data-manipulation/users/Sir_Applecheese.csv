unpopularopinion,ffehuom,t1_ffec2ft,1579848609.0,"I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, but as a person, should I really be required to refer to someone with an honorific to show respect? Does not using sir or ma'am mean you're disrespectful to a person? I don't know that person's name, so I'm probably just going to avoid using sentences that'd require filling it in with ma'am or sir.

However, I can absolutely see why people would get offended. It's not that the person is calling them ma'am or sir, it's that they feel, in order to be respectful, they need to call a person by a specific honorific. You should always show a stranger much more respect than someone you're familiar with, for it's easy to create misunderstanding that seem rude, so using polite speech can be the difference between being rude and not, yet I don't feel that a person should degrade themselves (if they feel using honorifics is degrading)."
