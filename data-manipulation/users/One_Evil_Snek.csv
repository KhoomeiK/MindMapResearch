AskReddit,ffimnte,t1_ffilkh2,1579977534.0,What a worthwhile comment.
discgolf,ffimde5,t1_ffidx87,1579977334.0,"In my opinion, they don't understand that what their dog did has a lasting impact on you. People who don't disc golf don't understand that discs need to be ""seasoned"", and that you're truly attached to a piece of plastic. I wouldn't call you spineless, but I would say that you should have said something to educate the owner to the to mitigate the problem in the future. Because, at this point, the dog just held on to something for a while and inconvenienced you. Which we both know is only the beginning of the problem."
discgolf,ffil65r,t1_ffh061p,1579976505.0,"I don't understand why that would lead you to think they're ""MLK"" editions. That's such a naive way to look at it."

You obviously didn't comprehend the question."
AMA,ffi1336,t1_ffhgnnq,1579961882.0,I guess not. Which means I'm not sober either.
todayilearned,ffh9gwc,t1_ffh1rh6,1579926986.0,That's true.

todayilearned,ffgj5ou,t3_etf4n0,1579907442.0,This just isn't true. Only some grasshoppers can become locusts. You should probably summarize better next time.
AMA,fffp5n7,t1_fffloth,1579888767.0,You too!
AMA,fffkmbs,t1_fffk4bv,1579886001.0,"Lesser of evils doesn't really equate to ""OK"" though. Punching someone is the lesser of two evils if you're comparing punching someone to shooting someone, and obviously that isn't ok.

I understand your logic, but I feel like the comparison should be ""doing X drug"" to ""doing no drugs"", not ""doing X drug"" to ""doing Y drug"".

I understand your point and where you're coming from. I really do. If you need some sort of substance, you should probably choose one that is marginally healthier and safer for you. But, in my own opinion, to say that you're sober but still smoking weed isn't really an accurate statement since you're still using a substance to impair your brain's natural functions.

I don't look down on people that occasionally smoke, so please don't take this as shaming anyone who does. That isn't my intention whatsoever."

DiscGolfValley,ff53u6v,t3_eroobn,1579579478.0,"More discs in the bag make the game easier. It's a fact. More discs isn't what you need. You just need to learn to use the discs in different ways. I guarantee you aren't bombing 600 foot drives in real life, so making the comparison to your bag doesn't make sense."
DiscGolfValley,ff52n9v,t1_ff4qtqt,1579578558.0,"I hate those posts. At least show the hole and talk about the disc selection or something, ya know?"

That being said, I only know the ""YouTube Brodie"". Could be a completely different guy when you meet him in real life. In a way, he *has* to be YouTube Brodie in order to stay relevant, so I wonder if this will be an outlet for him to be more of himself."
DiscGolfValley,ff47ljz,t3_erjjk2,1579557288.0,Happens in real life too.
DiscGolfValley,ff2t8tm,t1_ff2oxvf,1579523196.0,"I'm just wondering what is entirely special about this shot that merits a share. Sure, the shot was close, but most people who play this game a lot will have one or two of these a day when they play.

I'm all for sharing cool and interesting shots, but this is just an average one in my opinion."
discgolf,ff22ot4,t1_ff21emf,1579492172.0,"Your foot is *a* way to change it. You might consider taking a picture of yourself with your foot turned inward to see where it places your hips. From there, you can try to hit that mark when you're driving.

u/seabas22 describes it as a horse stance. He's got some videos on his YouTube channel about it."
discgolf,ff218as,t3_er75xi,1579491073.0,You mentioned your foot. What you really should be looking at is where your hips are pointing. They need to be closed to power the shot. Yours are opening very early and robbing distance from you.
DiscGolfValley,ff1ufzo,t1_fey54v4,1579486436.0,Design on that hole specifically was very good. I wish the rest were like that. Some woods holes with that concept in mind would be pretty cool.
DiscGolfValley,ff1uc1d,t3_eqs960,1579486367.0,That little skip and bounce up the hill always deflates me because 99/100 times you're going directly into the water.

DiscGolfValley,fez6425,t1_feypj49,1579454166.0,You can't do it from the tee. You have to be close enough to the wall were you start your throw.

AskReddit,feu5ucm,t1_fetvqjs,1579383377.0,"That video pretty much describes it perfectly. If all of the little details were fixed, I feel like that would have been a masterpiece film.

And I also think people don't realize the ending isn't supposed to be very happy. That smile isn't ""I made him a good musician and unlocked his potential"", it's ""I finally manipulated him into accepting my abuse, allowing me to use him as a pawn in the future"". So many people miss that fact."
discgolf,fesds99,t3_eqg2eo,1579364141.0,"You're still rounding and throwing with a ton of nose up. I would look into fixing those problems.

You should also be planting your right foot a foot or two in front of your left (perpendicular to the direction of the throw) to keep your hips loaded until they explode through."
discgolf,fep74d2,t1_fep6aur,1579313628.0,"I mean, yeah. I guess. But he often times was going more for an air bounce type thing that was robbing him distance. I'm sure he has it figured out now based on other comments."
