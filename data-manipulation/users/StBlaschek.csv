The story is about selfless, unconditional sacrifice.

Her hair can grow back, and he can get his watch out of pawn, but, in the end, they've both sacrificed something of little value to anyone but themselves, which makes the gesture more precious and priceless. It's that sacrifice that is their true gift to each other.

In some books, the guy takes a bullet for the woman he loves, but sacrifice needn't be so drastic in order to show someone you love them.
