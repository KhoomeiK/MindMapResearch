You can either be monogamous, and  dedicate yourself to one person and develop a relationship that is much stronger than one that is purely physical, or you don't and just play the field forever. Some people are perfectly happy not settling down with anyone, but for me personally, the game got old real quick right around the age 30."

science,ffxfjul,t1_ffxehre,1580324126.0,"In my case, I think they legit thought I was dumb until I unexpectedly basically aced a standardized test that had an average score of 58% for our grade. Mind you they expected low results since it was given to 8th graders at the time and we were 5th (i think) grade. It was a wild ride when we got our results back. At first I thought it was like golf, maybe the higher the score, the worse you did, since even straight A students were averaging like mid 70% at the highest. Two only people got higher than mine, and they were basically the super genius kids that you know grew up to be brain surgeons or rocket scientists.

I ended up scoring in the top 1%, only getting two questions wrong out of around 200, which left the teaching staff more or less baffled. The same year I ended up getting second place in a county writing competition. However, in my case, they were all very supportive before and after and I wasnt treated badly. I knew immediately what kind of class they moved me into though, when I went from doing more advanced math for that grade to all of a sudden being given assignments that were basic arithmetic. I also was put on Ritalin which was a bummer. I used to tongue it and spit it out when I left the room. It was a stressful couple of years because they were unsure of what kind of learning style suited me, but it was obvious that I was not excelling in regular classes. In the end I was given a lot of one-on-one classes as a substitute for a few of the typically structured classes where I ended up learning at an upper middle school level instead of 4th/5th grade like everyone else."

She is using you as a safety net and if she decides to stay with you, it will be because her boyfriend dumped her and you are a lifeline until the next one comes along.

The people who take these loans either have made a conscious plan to pay it off, weighed the pros and cons and still decided to go ahead with it. I think its dumb still, but then again, those people might disagree with my choices for vacation, or hobbies. Fair enough. The other individuals are likely financially irresponsible and probably have a pattern of bad decision making, so taking a $30k loan for their wedding is just another bad decision among the others. All to feed their narcissism. Its not a systematic issue, it is a 'them' issue. Its the same reason there are people making millions a year who are living paycheck to paycheck. We don't make excuses for MC-Hammer blowing all his money, because he was rich and became poor, but we as a society seem to be willing to enable for people who are not rich and make really really bad decisions. We do that by blaming society as a system and not the person.

If you say no and the answer is because you don't use social media, I am going to call bullshit. I think the answer is because you are not a dunce and know that you should not do that and so using your brain you make the decision on your own accord to not do it.

I have a friend who got charged with ""domestic violence"" because when him, his gf, myself and two other friends were at BestBuy in the early 2000's, he grabbed a hole she had in her jeans right below her pocket. He wasnt being malicious and they were not arguing, he was just being a goofy 19 year old and accidentally caused her jeans to rip a little bit exposing like and inch and half more of her skin than what was already exposed by the hole she already had. She got pissed and left the store and gave him the silent treatment and three days later he received a court summons in the mail. Apparently her mom convinced her to file charges and now the dude has a domestic violence charge on his record. 

You know the details of his incident so no comment can be made there, but without knowing what it is, I would say context really matters and if it is egregious, it is up to you whether or not you think he has grown into a better person. As far as the law is concerned, he paid for his crime, so outside of that, nobody can tell you what is right or wrong, its up to you to trust that he is a good and honest person and to give him a chance if he deserves it or part ways if you don't trust him."

Pseudo Saturn in general will allow you to keep the memory expansion features, but you lose the save backup functionality. The red carts use a modified firmware that supposedly works save backups back in, but I have never used one so I cannot confirm or deny if it works. But yes, at the very least, it will allow you to play backups and works as a memory expansion.

I cannot comment on what you need to power the console and do not want to be responsible for telling you something that may damage your console or burn down your house. I live in the US and have a US model and the Japanese skeleton console.

SegaSaturn,ffrpw8u,t3_euvbkp,1580163189.0,"Im not sure about the power conversion to play a US console in Europe. That being said, the console with a mod chip and a burned disc is obviously the cheapest route to play some games. Pseudo Saturn is probably the easiest way to play, but you need to buy a AR memory cart which is like $20-$35 then you need to buy an official game as well as be able to burn the Pseudo Saturn installer to a blank disc, or you can buy a Pseudo Saturn ""red cart"" on eBay for around $35-$55 with it preinstalled and it will have the modded save feature to allow you to use the cart as a memory cart as well as a Pseudo Saturn cart. Personally, I just have a modchip in mine and burned discs. The backup battery can be replaced easily, its just a CR2032 located in the expansion bay. You can just pop the battery out and put in a new one. So, in short, a modchip and burned discs might be the ""cheapest"" way to get up and running, but for a lot of game you need the AR cart anyway, so it might be better to just buy a red cart and burn some games."

relationship_advice,ff9ykb7,t3_esc6xe,1579724276.0,"By ""birth control"" does she mean all contraceptives including condoms? If so, that would be a hard pass for me. One, I dont know if I could marry someone if we never had sex, mainly because sex compatibility is a big deal if you value a physical relationship for reasons other than procreating, and two, even if you are physically compatible, you dont want to risk having a kid every single time you have sex even if you are married. As cool is it probably is to have kids, having like 15 kids would be a real bummer."
relationship_advice,ff93b9c,t1_ff88cqf,1579703812.0,"I think the concept of ""victim blaming"" and its position as an untouchable topic is kind of concerning. I think the point most people are trying to make is not, ""this is what you get for dressing like a slut!"", more so than it is, ""why dress a certain way if you know what outcome is probable?"". It isn't considered victim blaming to tell people not to over dress in poverty stricken areas, instead we give out warnings to people travelling to places like Tijuana and tell them to leave their jewelry at home.  Personally, I am more curious why they would hangout in places that have these types of individuals hanging around. There has to be safer places to go while wearing what you want to wear."

In the last 20 years I have lived here, the coldest it has gotten was around -30F at night, and that was uncharacteristically cold. The mid -10's F seems to be the average cold winter.

There is the metaphor comparing the weight that an ant can lift to a human being capable of picking up a steam roller or some nonsense. If you scaled an ant up in every way to the size it would need to be to fit that metaphor, it definitely would not be able to pick up a steamroller. I imagine if you were trying to scale a building like the empire state building up to various multiples of its current size, the base of the building would have to be a lot different."
