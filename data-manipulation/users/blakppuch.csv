college,ffj2w1e,t3_etuh50,1579989020.0,Never dropped a class but there is a class I really wanna nope tf out rn!! but unfortunately I cannot do that cause it’s essential to my major. This lecturer goes on and on about her life and how she got her phd. After mentioning that she has her phd she goes “I wouldn’t tell you what year cause I don’t want you to know my age hahah...ok it was 1989...I know I’m old”. Like wtf! And she never EVER finishes a topic on time because of this lol. It’s frustrating. And oh she counts attendance so I have to be there always. I’d love to sleep through it but it’s more of classroom than lecture hall so she can see everything . I can’t escape it!!!

UCD,fffqk44,t1_fffpvrg,1579889637.0,Thank you I will look into that. Just wouldn’t be able to be a bartender cause I’m only going to be 20 by then. I think you need to be 21 for the bar jobs.

Where he had a very intense violent poop because he was lactose intolerant LOOOL. That’s where we got our reference from."
