Fallout,ffk4med,t3_etrure,1580015696.0,My kids freaked out that their grandfather had a record and cassette of Big Iron. They thought it was so cool that it was a real song and Grandpa had it.
nfl,ffe0tjc,t1_ffdxfol,1579833769.0,"It's not just Twitter and Facebook. Several sports broadcasters and bloggers have lit him up, along with a lot of people in the comments sections."
nfl,ffdw7fs,t1_ffdvj5e,1579830453.0,"He didn't say to just hit him hard. He was insinuating that the defense should risk a penalty by taking a cheap shot. 

Good defensive coaches won't say to hit someone dirty. You can play hard and hit hard but there's no need to do it outside the rules or risk hurting someone."
nfl,ffdvjvr,t1_ffdtk9q,1579829989.0,I don't think there's a defensive player in the NFL who's going to think they shouldn't hit someone hard with a legal hit. Saying they should risk a penalty on an illegal hit is something different.
nfl,ffdv9oc,t1_ffdtclt,1579829791.0,He didn't say to not let him go down easy. He said to risk a 15 yard penalty to lay on a dirty hit.
nfl,ffdv4m7,t1_ffdsjct,1579829693.0,"There's no reason to not hit hard because this is football. He was insinuating to hit him dirty and risk a 15 yard penalty. Regardless if he's suggesting to do it to shake up a young QB playing in a big game or saying ito take him out, it's a shit stick thing to say play dirty."
nfl,ffdutur,t1_ffdtlbm,1579829476.0,"When he said to hit him and take the 15 yards, he's obviously so acting to play dirty."
nfl,ffdum9p,t1_ffdtmzw,1579829327.0,"There's nothing wrong with a hard and solid hit. However, it's not right (or borderline illegal, like you said) to hit him when he's starting a slide and taking the 15 yard penalty, like this guy said."

YouShouldKnow,fdm1x79,t1_fdl9xtx,1578537859.0,Radar while moving is just as accurate as radar while stationary.
YouShouldKnow,fdm0bri,t1_fdlksl3,1578536782.0,"My comment earlier probably wasn't worded real well. Only the state police can use radar and they can use it stationary or while moving. All other law enforcement agencies are required by statute to use vascar, which you have to be stationary to use."

YouShouldKnow,fdl14a9,t1_fdkzz9h,1578515216.0,Radar works by converting doppler shift into speed as the target is moving towards or away from you. The amount of shift from doors opening/closing or vehicle sway is so minimal it has no effect on how a radar gun functions.
YouShouldKnow,fdl05fu,t1_fdkpewi,1578514703.0,"There's only a couple of halfway decent laser jammers on the market but they haven't been as effective in the last few years (5 or so years) since law enforcement now uses a variable pulse laser. There's a guy on YouTube (Radar Ray, Radar Roy, something like that) who has some very good videos of actual tests he's ran on jammers."
YouShouldKnow,fdkwd26,t1_fdkprwx,1578512520.0,"Exactly. I live a little east of the KC metro and hadn't seen the zipper merge used until a few years ago. People have it in their head to stack up bumper to bumper in one or two lanes for miles and will not let people in, or several people cut in when one car merges. It causes a world of issues because no one likes change and likes being assholes."

YouShouldKnow,fdkuynw,t1_fdkqa4z,1578511693.0,"My radar unit is certified to be accurate to less than +/- 1 MPH. It also has an internal test that I run and a tuning fork test that I run to ensure it's accurate. At a minimum, most departments in Missouri that use the radar I have check the calibration with a tuning fork at the beginning and end of each shift and do the internal test soon after the vehicle stop. I generally due both of calibration tests multiple times through a shift and after vehicle stops. If either calibration test fails, the radar is sent to a repair center to be repaired and recertified."
YouShouldKnow,fdkrtak,t1_fdkh54v,1578509824.0,"As of a few years ago, only the Pennsylvania State Police were allowed to use radar while moving, and they were limited to k band radar. Everyone else had to use VASCAR while stationary.. I looked for the statute and can't find it, though."
YouShouldKnow,fdkq09j,t1_fdklze4,1578508749.0,"Modern radars are not connected to the speedometer. Instead, the radar has two antennas that measure the patrol car speed and traffic speed."
YouShouldKnow,fdkperh,t1_fdkgskt,1578508394.0,The zipper merge and traffic crossovers are efficient until you factor in human stupidity. Missouri has recently started using both and they run fine until people forget how to use common sense.
YouShouldKnow,fdkp6hq,t1_fdkg4l2,1578508257.0,"The fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine are 4th, 5th, and 6th Amendment protections, which deal with the improper gathering of evidence. Observing your speed on a highway would fall under the Exclusionary Rule through the plain view and inevitable discovery exceptions, and any attorney would have a nearly impossible time fighting it in court. Plus, you would have to prove the officer was speeding, which would be difficult."
YouShouldKnow,fdkiz9b,t1_fdkaxtb,1578504740.0,"Modern radar units have nothing to do with the speedometer. The radar has two antennas, one for the police car speed and one for traffic speed. As long as the radar unit is certified, the accuracy is extremely accurate."
YouShouldKnow,fdkikyj,t1_fdkdp32,1578504542.0,"Part of the issue in some US states is the driver of the vehicle is responsible for any infractions committed, not the driver. So, if I've borrowed the a friend's car, I would be the one to receive a ticket, not the registered owner.

A lot of cities have have shied away from red light cameras because some studies have shown they do not increase safety, and are instead being used as a cash cow, which has lead to public outrage."

Some undecided voters will fall for his rhetoric, just like they did in the first election."
