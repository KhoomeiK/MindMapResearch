Your original post is honestly kind of a red flag
>I have no one and nothing without her


This is not okay. The fact that youâ€™re placing your happiness solely on her is a huuuuge responsibility, and is probably why she is distancing herself. She probably needs some space, and Iâ€™m sorry if this comes across harshly, but you need to focus on bettering yourself, for yourself."
depression,fetph24,t3_eqlbx7,1579378009.0,"I hate to say this dude, but your girlfriend isnâ€™t in charge of fixing you. Are you going to therapy/seeking treatment? Do you have a med plan? Managing depression is a full time job, and she (or you) may not be emotionally able to handle a relationship on top of that until you are sorted out on the basics. Self care, good eating habits, and exercising regularly are all super important. I know it sound simple and basic, but that along with medication has shown the most improvement for myself personally. I would also look into practicing Mindfullness/Meditation, thereâ€™s pretty solid science behind the effectiveness of that. I also personally do â€œChallenging negative thoughts/self talkâ€ activities on a pretty regular basis. [This](https://imgur.com/a/1dBtkq3) is an Imagur link to my personal care plan, and a couple resource pages that I used to make it. Iâ€™d recommend doing some research online, and tailoring a plan made for you. Good luck, I know shit is hard but you can get through this.

polyamory,fe0xdy8,t3_enkshb,1578819808.0,"Dude, something SUPER similar just happened to me. When we first started seeing each other, he told me he lived with someone, but they were *maybe* trying to work it out, but they both had a â€œdonâ€™t ask donâ€™t tellâ€ situation about seeing other people. That was fishy right off the bat. I put off having sex with him for a good 2 months, and there were some other weird signs along the way. He would say he wasnâ€™t available to hang out, and then a short time later flip flop and say he actually could. Weâ€™d only ever hang out in my house, and rarely go anywhere else. Eventually we were drinking and I straight up asked him if he was cheating on someone (I have anxiety, I def shouldâ€™ve outwardly asked sooner but I didnâ€™t know if I was over reacting). He ended up kind of half assedly saying â€œnot reaally?â€. I asked him â€œIf she knew you were here, would she say you were cheating?â€ And he said yeah. I got upset and told him to leave, havenâ€™t seen him since. Trust your gut, if there was any way for me to find out who he was dating or where he lived Iâ€™d tell her in a heartbeat. unfortunately there are people who try to take advantage of poly people."

If one primer doesnâ€™t do the job, you can double prime. I also have problem skin and this works for me.

How long it takes you to move on has nothing to do with how faithful or good of a person you are, and itâ€™s a bit unfair to the new partner to keep them a secret.

Donâ€™t be discouraged, Iâ€™ve been doing my make up since middle school and Iâ€™m 25 now, but Iâ€™m constantly learning new techniques for my face/eye shape. You got this, and itâ€™s def worth it to invest in good products/tools for the best results. Edited to add: I also think your crease could use some dimension. Try using at least 2-3 colors for your crease every time, a light transition color at first, then blend in a slightly darker color to the middle of your crease, and a very dark shade for the outer V of your eye. This look couldâ€™ve done nicely with a cut crease to make that pink on the lid pop. Hope that helps/makes sense lol"

Itâ€™s good to see your posture and all that, and I donâ€™t really see how it would be any different then all the bullshit other people post (like makeup selfies, or any other hobby).

femalehairadvice,fdj0rfq,t3_elmv1b,1578455519.0,"Personally, I like the middle color. Itâ€™s fun, but itâ€™s not as high maintenance as the last color. If you choose the last color, youâ€™re looking at (at least) 2-3 bleaches BEFORE You color to get your hair light enough for a pastel color (Iâ€™d guess more than that tbh tho since your hair is so dark naturally, like 4 or 5). To not COMPLETELY fry your hair, youâ€™re also gonna need to space those bleaches out, the longer the better but at least 3 weeks in between. Youâ€™re going to go through the bleach phases, which rarely look cute at first (expect some orange ass hair). Do not use box bleach kits, the best thing to do for the last color is go professional. If you decide to try it at home anyway, DO NOT go over 30 developer, and DO NOT use quick blue powder (also never start at the roots, bleach develops faster there because of the natural heat on your head). Good luck 
Edited to add: if your hair is virgin and has never been colored, you may be looking at less on the bleach, but itâ€™s still gonna take some time"
