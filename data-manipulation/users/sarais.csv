bujo,fckcoyd,t3_ehkkcy,1577722365.0,"Instead of bujo-ing, how about jo-ing at first? Draw in it, write in it, paste photos, list things you want to do, things you don't want to forget. Think of all the things that help you with your anxiety and depression. Write all of those down as a self-care page.  Scribble, doodle with a pencil, pen, marker...whatever gives you some hope or peace or joy.

And to answer your question, I think dotted, ruled, plain, grid...it's all preference. I started with dotted,  preferred grid for a while, then lined... (maybe it was an excuse for me to buy new journals). If you are unsure, find some really inexpensive, small notebooks to start out with. It's going to be trial-and-error to find what works for you."
