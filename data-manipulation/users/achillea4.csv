britishproblems,ffhuvo3,t1_ffhouky,1579955016.0,Yeah. Can't believe they changed the design. I'm completely incapable of pulling the darn thing off. They just want us to keep buying the more expensive dispenser bottles.
britishproblems,ffhob31,t3_etgbkw,1579945130.0,Not quite as bad but Southeastern have a habit of putting on 10 carriage trains off-peak and 8 during peak.   It makes such a difference to the level of crowding... Oh and let's just increase fares again by 3%...

AskCulinary,ffhm68c,t1_ffhhnyh,1579941899.0,I don't remember avocados in the 70s .. well not in the UK at least. Prawn cocktails were served in a wine glass if you wanted to be dead posh.
AskCulinary,ffhm3zf,t1_ffhgymb,1579941807.0,Now hors d'oeuvres is a great 70s term. Never see it used any more.

AskCulinary,ffhlznn,t3_etl7ms,1579941629.0,In the 70s a prawn cocktail was the height of sophistication. Served in a wine goblet. Would still eat this now if I ever saw it on a menu.
Scotch,ffhls9g,t1_ffhcjrd,1579941328.0,Second this. My favourite scotch by far. Great coastal Highland dram.
Gin,ffhlkps,t3_eti9jc,1579941027.0,We've got a bottle of this and hate it! Asked parents to pick up a normal bottle at the airport and got this...a bloody litre of the stuff. Anyone got any ideas on how we can use it without being overwhelmed by the  lime flavour?

britishproblems,ffa07fl,t3_esbzk1,1579725237.0,But that's only on the American TV / American recipes right? I've never heard anyone in this country call white gloop or tomato sauce gravy.
neilyoung,fexigyj,t3_eqgt66,1579431532.0,Thanks for this. I just listened to the Thom Yorke interview where he talks about Neil. I didn't know he was such a massive fan.  He says he has never been in awe of anyone as quite much as Neil.  Quite right!
AskOldPeople,fexdurh,t3_eqojhj,1579429361.0,Learn how to touch type. I did it at school decades ago and it has saved me hours of work - particularly when writing reports or churning out emails.

thisisus,fe4zzfg,t3_enolcn,1578864388.0,Haven't seen that but did watch A beautiful day in the neighborhood the other day about Mr Rogers. It has the actress who plays Beth in it. Quite a nice wholesome movie. Also has Tom Hanks and Mathew Rhys.

aww,fe315xr,t3_enlafg,1578844915.0,Sad to see the koala being given water the wrong way. There are articles in the news today saying pouring water down their throats from a bottle can give them pneumonia and that they need to drink it like a dog - lapping it. Koalas are dying because of this.

OutOfTheLoop,fe14u4m,t1_fdzqrcy,1578822554.0,It's called 'A beautiful day in the neighborhood' (Tom Hanks and Matthew Rhys). I watched it the other day. I'm not American so had no idea who Fred Rogers was but I enjoyed the film and ended up doing some Internet research afterwards to get some context and history on the guy.
environment,fe0ud7o,t3_enhj8s,1578818708.0,"It's frustrating that in many places, the till automatically spits out a receipt whether you want one or not... If you say that you don't want one the cashier then throws it away. Total waste."

Unemployed,fdovf0d,t3_emhsij,1578613758.0,"LinkedIn. Which country are you in? I also think it's worth finding recruiters for your specific sector and sending your cv into them directly. Even better if you can get a meeting with them so that you become more than just a name. Most recruiters will trawl the likes of LinkedIn, Reed, Monster, Jobsite but will also have their own website where you can register.

With LinkedIn it is important that you flag the relevant skills and ensure your profile uses the right search words to make it easier for them to find you."
vegangifrecipes,fdo7vo7,t3_em8hw5,1578600421.0,"I think I'd also add mushrooms/dried porcini, red wine and some wholegrain mustard and maybe a bit of vegemite to beef up the flavour."

london,fcy7qrv,t1_fcxsh8r,1578075934.0,Second Tonbridge or the villages around it. The train line into London Bridge and charing Cross is good and property is cheaper than tunbridge Wells or Sevenoaks. Always get a seat in the morning which is a bonus. Our local station is Hildenborough which is very popular with commuters. We used to rent in Surrey near Effingham Junction which was also a good commute but property was more expensive. Surrey and Sussex are pricey but Kent is generally cheaper and I think the train lines are better.

UKPersonalFinance,fcpp0qt,t3_ei2mbt,1577869044.0,"I don't think not having a degree will necessarily prevent you from taking a senior job later on. Finance and Accounting is a very broad subject. I don't have experience of working for an accountancy firm but have worked on a lot of big change projects within finance. If you can get into a large company as an apprentice then you can study for your professional qualifications as you go. A large multi national org will have endless finance functions and roles that you could move into. A number of people I have met started off as junior accountants then migrated into managing new system implementations (you can't avoid technology). You could work in the preparation of company financial accounts, monthly management accounts, reporting, accounts payable / receivable, budgeting etc.

If you are in a big company then it is easier to get different roles and move up the ladder without a degree..which may or may not be a sticking point later down the line."
UKPersonalFinance,fcpnhxj,t3_ei0w6s,1577868119.0,"If your intention is not to work and live off this amount for the rest of your life then 250k is nowhere near enough at the withdrawal rate you are suggesting over say a 60 year period. If you don't need the money yet I'd suggest leaving it alone and keep adding to it so you benefit from compound interest.

There are plenty of investment calculators online that you can use for projections. Sorry, I'm on my phone and don't have the links to hand. I think Hargreaves lansdown site has a number of them."
UKPersonalFinance,fcpkkl0,t3_eicwp6,1577866376.0,"Sounds like you would benefit from getting back to basics and figuring out what your investment strategy should be.. % equity vs non equity, level of risk,countries and sectors, investment horizon etc. Would recommend Smarter Investing by Tim Hale.

Once you have grasped the basics it will be much clearer what to invest in. You don't want overlap ideally and should keep the number of funds small.

You can either go with a mixed fund like LS which is a basket of funds containing equities and bonds (LS 100 is all equities). Or you could make up your own basket, mixed to match your strategy. For this you could maybe use the Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap as your main equity fund and add in some satellite funds if you want bonds, real estate or specialist sectors.

If you are starting out then until you know what you are doing you may be better off with something like LS or one of the other funds of funds - do your research first. I personally don't like the UK bias of the vanguard product."

However, are the skills and experience you have still relevant and in demand or has technology moved on? I don't know what area you work in exactly but it's scary these days how quickly knowledge becomes out of date. I spent a fair amount of time over the past 6 months reading up on the latest best practices and software systems. I'm worried that my 32 years of experience is not so relevant If I haven't got any knowledge of the latest systems.

I also find that the older you get, university education becomes less relevant and it's more about demonstrated experience.. At least in my profession."

We really don't like flavoured gins and this tastes like someone has added a load of kaffir lime leaves to it. Tried mixing it 50:50 with a normal gin and it still gate crashed the G&T. Sorry, not my cup of tea at all. If you like a lot of lime you may like it. The only other thing I'd suggest is mixing it with a load of ice and soda.  Really, gin can only get better than this."
