autism,ff2la2l,t3_eh7gth,1579511454.0,"Glad you posted, feeling lonely sucks. Sorry to hear your mobility is compounding the issue, too. There are a couple of housebound people-centric discord communities, if talking via voice chat would help any.

I've had the same problem being unsure whether someone was still interested in a conversation/etc. My rule of thumb is if a service worker is on the clock when they're chatting, they're probably Just Being Polite (see also, that server isn't flirting with you they want a good tip). Grocery stores are hard though, I mostly do NOT talk to folks in them.

What actually worked for me was finding an activity that I knew other people also liked.  Personally I like going to dog park meetups. Obviously the people there love dogs, so we immediately have something in common to talk about. If our conversation drops off , we can always focus more on the dogs playing. 

Maybe you could look something that has your interests like a book club or discussion group?"

Do you use an X card or anything similar?
