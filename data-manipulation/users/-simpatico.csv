germanshepherds,fgwawzl,t1_fgvj7gw,1581159051.0,So you keep your dog either in a crate or outside when you’re not around? Maybe just don’t get a dog if your lifestyle doesn’t support it.
TaylorSwift,fgv9qjs,t1_fguqd4v,1581141609.0,"honestly i’m just surprised taylor okayed this tbh because i see her as having high standards for the stuff she puts out and this.. is just not it lol. 

I realise now that the graphics are probably purposely bad to mimic a video game, but still it’s kinda jarring. And my question is why not use more video gamey font for the lyrics?"
germanshepherds,fgv9dht,t1_fgv45t3,1581141255.0,What do you mean “inside and crated than outside”? Why is the only alternative to a crate putting her outside?
TaylorSwift,fguwkxc,t1_fgukmqo,1581131045.0,i mean... the background is a picture of taylor swift. don’t think professional is what they were going for here lol
germanshepherds,fguflqo,t1_fgudpz4,1581119599.0,"As i already said i’m fine with crate training puppies. I crated my puppy overnight too. My problem is with the people who consider the crate to be a lifelong thing, put their dog in the crate whenever they go out / during the night etc. Basically treat the dog like a toy you just put away when you’re done with it."
germanshepherds,fgtr6gg,t1_fgtlfxr,1581108281.0,"Think it was just precautionary as he was new. OP says he isn’t crated anymore. I agree though I don’t like seeing dogs in crates but they do have their purpose when it comes to raising a puppy or when you get an untrained rescue. It is cruel to use them long term though imo and the goal should always be free roam eventually.

And before any long term crate user comes for me: I don’t care that you think your dog considers his cage his “den” and feels “safe” in it."
AmItheAsshole,fgt8on4,t1_fgt3fzm,1581101059.0,Jesus that dricolor gave me chemical burns. Nasty stuff.
TaylorSwift,fgt13q5,t3_f0dbb5,1581096847.0,wtf is with this shitty animation though
worldnews,fgsbunx,t1_fgsahmv,1581079804.0,Yeah but it’s not as bad as “anyone can die if left unattended”.
worldnews,fgs79re,t1_fgs5cq6,1581074942.0,but they said it was like a cold or flu
TinyHouses,fgrl49v,t3_f04i9v,1581049629.0,needs more sliding glass doors
cripplingalcoholism,fgr7gev,t3_f01rzj,1581040012.0,I switched from beer to wine a couple weeks ago and my farts are near odorless now. Shits are much cleaner too. What a revelation it has been
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fgr2rrw,t1_fgr1bwa,1581036851.0,"I think it’s only on amazon and specifically amazon fulfilled products. Not seen it anywhere else. It is quite annoying though, i’ve definitely accidentally clicked it before."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fgqoazd,t1_fgqjly0,1581028066.0,"> it's not exactly a single click to order something.

It is exactly a single click to order something, at least in the UK"
maybemaybemaybe,fgperpc,t1_fgpbfen,1581003342.0,Jesus the double standards reddit has when it comes to animals. Rabbit dies and everyone laughs. Someone even mentions a cat dying and it’s OMG FUCK OFF I LOVE CATS. Cat people are freaks
1200isplenty,fgnro39,t1_fgnpz4k,1580951397.0,That’s understandable tbh. Maybe small tupperware containers would be a better option. At least they last longer than bags.
