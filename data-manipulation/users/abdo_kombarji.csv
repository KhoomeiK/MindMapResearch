So i found my self got rid of it.

So to THOES WHO ARE BROKEN, believe me you are a charming person but you just knew the wrong person who have broken you, and he is the loser cuz he lost someone like you. 

What to do?

Just use this sadness and help your self to find your real self, use it and don't yoy ever give up and let your self for Sadness. 
Keep working and meet new people and don't regret your past, cuz the hard times always reveal the true soul of you."
