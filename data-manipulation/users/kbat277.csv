Epilepsy,ff2l3s9,t3_eqek7s,1579511195.0,"i also have drug resistant epilepsy, diagnosed as an adult. i am still coming to terms with it, especially being ok with the fact that i now i have a disability.  going to therapy has helped. all my EEGs were normal too, mine was from a virus but they never figured out what it was, so i get the frustration. 
sudep is also scary but honestly there are some things you can do to be safe, and beyond that you really have no control."
seizures,feyhfnf,t3_enztwo,1579445616.0,will you share the results with us?
Epilepsy,fep97cu,t3_epm4zg,1579314962.0,"i was diagnosed at 25 after contracting what the doctors at the hospital decided to call viral encephalitis (no one ever figured out exactly what it was). it’s affected my life in almost every way and i take massive amounts of medication, but! since my diagnosis 7 years ago i have moved across the country, gone to grad school, gotten married, gone to grad school AGAIN, and traveled internationally several times. it’s shitty but you’ve gotta find your new normal. :) this subreddit has helped me enormously."
Epilepsy,fdscb38,t1_fds67wd,1578699339.0,this is a valid discussion to have but in my opinion probably not in this thread where someone is expressing their grief about losing a family member.
Nightshift,fd1r91w,t3_ejtvm0,1578135552.0,"holy shit!!! i couldn’t function on that little sleep, and i don’t even have children. sometimes i feel guilty for not paying more attention to my dog and he even sleeps in my bed... (only kind of kidding)."
Epilepsy,fczsb5w,t1_fczfjaa,1578107771.0,"don’t take this the wrong way but do you think you’re worrying so much that you’re spiraling? i do that, it can be hard not to. PM if you like. :)"
Epilepsy,fczcfsh,t1_fczb75l,1578098126.0,"everyone is so different, i wouldn’t rule anything out before doing some experiments. caffeine and lack of sleep are common. maybe try driving without music and see what happens? also if it is music (for example) it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s all music, all the time. like certain tempos make me feel weird, and listening to music with my headphones in crowded places. poking around in this subreddit you’ll probably find all kinds of strange triggers.
this shit sucks though. once you feel more in control, you may feel better in general."
Epilepsy,fcyqu7t,t3_ejb8d2,1578085186.0,"do you listen to music while you drive?
i’m asking because i learned that one of my main triggers is certain types of sounds, especially ambient noise while i was driving."
