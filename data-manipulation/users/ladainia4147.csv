TheSilphRoad,ffigzto,t1_ffgo6gu,1579973653.0,"It's more of a habit now, really. When I first started, I was always so paranoid about running out of revives and potions because I'd see other people talking about it (talking about different ways to avoid using them and such), so for a long time I would try to avoid using my Max Revives. I'd use a regular revive and a potion for Pokémon that needed healed from battles, but I'd save the Max Revives to use only when healing teams in the middle of raids. It just became a habit of Max's for raids and regular+potion for all other revivals. I always have plenty of each now though, and I definitely keep more than I need, so I just keep both out of habit"
TheSilphRoad,ffig9mx,t1_fffrb32,1579973157.0,"That would be great, seriously. For me, I have to delete the small potions and regular balls so often, and it's so annoying when you try to spin a stop but you can't because you have 50 more useless potions/balls. I get that they want to let you know that you're full so you can delete what to don't want, but sometimes I'm just rushing by and just want the quest, so I'll end up missing it because I'm out of space. I'd set my revives and potions at 100, then 20/50/50 of red/blue/yellow balls, it would save so much time spent on deleting stuff I don't need"

You go ahead a deepthroat that shit like it's your damn job! And then tell her that you now have more online popularity points than her because of this"
TheSilphRoad,fffj7vb,t1_fff469o,1579885127.0,"I don't get it either, I've always kept 100 of each revive and 50 of the bigger potions just in case and I'm still constantly deleting them - it's annoying with my buddy brings me potions instead of berries. You'd think that if someone doesn't have many stops/gyms to spin to get potions, then they wouldn't be doing many raids or Rocket stops anyways, which is what most healing stuff gets used on. Even if someone can't spin that many stops/gyms, anybody can easily open the max amount of gifts daily by adding people from online - I've got a bunch of friends from the PoGo friend subreddit just for that purpose myself. Most of my potions come from the gifting from what I've noticed. I just don't get it"
TheSilphRoad,ffbbtqw,t1_ff9ndei,1579758896.0,"They don't listen for shit though. Since the day they decided to mess with the Community Day times, everybody's been VERY vocal that we absolutely hate the 11AM start time, yet that's the one they stuck with. And to add insult to injury, they randomly decided to give half the world a later start time for some reason. There's no reason for it at all and it's ridiculous. The majority of our local community couldn't even go out for Piplup CD because we had some insanely cold weather and wind in the morning (which we always do because it's the middle of winter and nothing has warmed up by then yet). 

Plus that they finally changed up the egg pool and somehow managed to make it even worse than before. So if they do listen to anything we say they sure as hell don't do anything about it. I seriously question if anybody who works at Niantic actually plays the game at all"
TheSilphRoad,ffbbdxt,t3_esfna4,1579758433.0,"I just don't see why there wasn't just an in game poll where you pick once and that's it. There's some big flaws with this weird system and a regular poll just seems so much more efficient and fair. 

And it's getting really ridiculous that they keep saying they want to listen to the community when we've all been screaming at them to STOP MAKING OUR COMMUNITY DAYS START AT 11AM since the day it started and they still won't listen. It's absolutely unfair that half of the players get screwed on CD time and the rest don't. Like WTF, just make it somewhere in the middle for everyone and keep it that way. As long as they continue to ignore us about that, them saying they want to do what the community wants is complete BS"

Yes, the egg pools desperately needed changed, but to get rid of so many useful things in 10K's and still keep so much garbage is complete and total bullshit. We could actually use things like Larvitar, Dratini and Beldum, but instead they kept goddamn FEEBAS, Shieldon, etc. I genuinely hate getting 10K's because I just know it's going to be another useless ass Shieldon. I've always kept up with hatching and buy incubators with Google Play credit all the time, but I'm done with it now, it's just not worth it anymore"

aww,fe4tegq,t1_fe3xg27,1578862632.0,"You're right about the brain, I misread what I saw it said *most animals didn't, not all, and that they have one of the smallest brains of all mammals in proportion to their body mass, so I fixed that in my comment. 

And other animals babies aren't eating feces because it's the only option like koalas are (even so, I didn't say they were the only ones doing it, just for those reasons). Baby koalas have to do it for survival because of their terrible choice in eating eucalyptus leaves. A few months after they're born, after drinking milk and before eating the eucalyptus leaves, the joeys start eating ""pap"" - they need to do that in order to obtain the right microorganisms from the mother so that they are able to start eating the eucalyptus (since it's such a terrible food source)"
aww,fe3irpu,t3_enlafg,1578849634.0,"I doubt this'll be seen, but please don't use water bottles to give koalas water, it's apparently killing them too. They've started putting out alerts that koalas are dying from people giving them water from bottles. They're basically drowning from it, they need to drink from bowls apparently, I saw a bunch of rescues posting about it on Instagram"
aww,fe3ikmt,t1_fe1dzwl,1578849581.0,"Yeah, a saw a bunch of rescues saying that now a lot of koalas are dying from being given water with bottles, they're drowning from it. They're apparently really not supposed to drink that way, they need a bowl or something similar"

They're basically drowning from it, they need to drink from bowls apparently, I saw a bunch of rescues posting about it on Instagram. So yeah lol, that's their stupidity at work I guess"
aww,fe3hid5,t1_fe2y1lb,1578849325.0,"How is calling koalas stupid being arrogant? It's basic fact, it's just how they are physically made. It's not an insult, just fact"
aww,fe3hax3,t1_fe2sdjr,1578849263.0,"Yeah, unfortunately they are literally evolutionary mistakes. They're one of a few animals that have smooth brains, and have one of the smallest brains in proportion to their bodies, and that's essentially why they're so stupid - they lack higher level recognition and understanding that most other animals have. If you put eucalyptus on a plate, they'll literally just stare at it because they're too stupid to realize that it's food if it's not on a branch. 

The water in that video is evidence of that too - apparently they're putting out alerts for people not to try to give them water like this because they have a high chance of drowning, yet instead of drinking the water from the bowl like it should, it's taking it from the bottle and essentially into its lungs. 

Read on if you want the disgusting side of it - Something like 80% or more of them have chlamydia because the males are so into raping, so the reason why many have the dark marking around the undersides in because they piss themselves while they're sleeping - the babies eat the parents shit because they've failed at evolution and their stupid choice in food, eucalyptus, is almost entirely un-digestable, poisonous and lacks in basic nutrition so the babies can't eat it and instead rely on pretty much sucking diarrhea out of their mothers assholes. 

Of course they don't deserve to suffer and die in fires, but let's not pretend like they're the pinnacle of the animal kingdom or anything."
Paranormal,fe3a99q,t1_fe04t8b,1578847443.0,"I actually know exactly what you mean. My first dog of my own as an adult, Dani, passed away a few years ago. Losing her absolutely broke me, she was my entire world. A few months later, we ended up adopting our girl Stella. We've had Stella for a little over 2 years now, and she's randomly picked up so many little things that Dani specifically did. I grew up with 4 dogs, so it's not like Stella's just doing dog stuff either, it's things that only Dani did. 

Dani had a favorite spot on the bed, now that's Stella's favorite spot, Dani would make this adorable noise when she yawned, and after about a year Stella started doing it too, Dani would sit and look out a certain window for hours and then Stella started doing it too - there's just so many little things that she does, so many little things about her personality that Stella does now, that she didn't used to do, that Dani always did. 

It really blows my mind how she's picked up so many things from a dog that she had never had an opportunity to meet. They say that animals have much more perception in things pertaining to what we call ""ghosts"" or ""spirits"", loved ones who have passed on but can still visit us and watch over us, and after everything that's happened with Stella I really do believe that. That and the fact that on several occasions since Dani passed away, I've randomly felt a cool breeze pass by me around knee level - it's never scared me like you'd think, I just immediately thought of Dani being there with me. 

I think of it like this : we don't know anything about the afterlife, whether real or not, but I wholeheartedly believe that if there is any way that our beloved pets would be able to visit us and watch over us, they absolutely would. That's such a special connection, the most pure form of love, and it truly isn't a bond that could ever be broken"
aww,fdwp3mr,t3_en610b,1578760978.0,"Your girl is absolutely gorgeous! I love how happy these sweet little babies are - my Stella wags her tail everytime I start moving near her to pet her, even when she's half asleep and I roll over to wake her up, she'll start wagging her tail while her eyes are still closed. Dogs really are just the best <3"
AmItheAsshole,fdwj4bq,t3_en6jau,1578759197.0,"NTA, absolutely not. There is NO excuse for bullying and quite frankly the parents who let their children get away with it are horrible. (This isn't you, you didn't have any previous knowledge of it and as soon as you did you took action against it.) You would be an asshole if you gave in though, that would be a horrible thing to go. She's upset about missing some parties and a dance? What about the girl she tormented? As someone who had a very persistent bully myself back in high school, I can definitely say that the victim deals with more than the bully could ever imagine. That poor girl was probably on edge all day at school, just hoping that she wouldn't run into her in the hallway or, even worse, after/before school. You're absolutely doing the right thing by grounding her. 

Maybe you could even look into counseling of some sort so your daughter can try to work out whatever problems she might be having? Some people are just assholes, but there's usually some sort of reasoning behind bullying somebody. That kind of behavior can be really dangerous in the real world after school ends too, so it's good for the perpetrator and victims (potential or otherwise) to get it sorted. 

I hope everything works out for you and your family though! As a former teenage girl, I can remember how awful we could be lol"

tifu,fdwgsso,t1_fdv88c9,1578758514.0,"Yeah, it's mostly made-up stories by teenagers looking for internet points unfortunately. I guess there's so many upvotes for the same reasons.

AskReddit,fds35bd,t3_emqd57,1578693605.0,"Barkshop / Barkbox 

We had gotten Barkbox for our girl Dani, and she really loved it. I had to cancel it when she passed away and they sent us a card personally signed by some staff members. That really meant a lot to me, she was so amazing and important and wonderful that I felt like it was weird that the world didn't know, like everybody should've been aware of it and affected by it. Even though we didn't personally know anyone who signed the card, it was a nice feeling to know that other people had taken time out of their lives to think about her and to appreciate her. 


When we adopted our Stella a few months later, her absolute favorite toy immediately became this green ball that came in Dani's first Barkbox (squeaky rubber ball with little spiky nubs on it with a fabric covering to look like Lady Liberty). I mentioned this in a chat with someone at Barkshop and they sent us another one just because they were glad that she liked her big sisters toy so much. 


It's been about 3 years now and Green Ball is 100% still Stella's favorite toy. I always buy their spiky balls in different designs because she loves them so much - Green Ball is definitely special though. She destroys toys in seconds, but she's so careful with this one, it's adorable. 

They're already really great with customer service and everything we've gotten has been great quality, between the toys and the snacks. They're great with and kind of returns too, they've never even asked me to send anything back, they just send a replacement out right away."
WTF,fdqrgvz,t1_fdpepdy,1578673299.0,"I definitely didn't need to be reminded of that, I only saw it myself at first just the other day. My mom is currently starting to learn and understand how to use her first ever smartphone and somehow she managed to find this and send it to me on Facebook Messenger. 


Then she proceeded to try to post it on Facebook and I promptly got several emails from them (I made her an email so I get the notifications) telling her she couldn't do that - she had apparently tried a few times because she really didn't see why she couldn't post a GIF of some dude popping his testicles out of his butthole on a public website. 


IDK what shocked me more actually, the video itself or the fact that she sent it to me in the first place. (I'm now looking for something along those lines to send to her as a sort of revenge, I'm assuming reddit will deliver eventually)"

ostomy,fcujlzw,t3_eir76q,1577982491.0,"I've found some really comfy shorts from Soffe (which everybody seemed to wear back in high school but have really great stuff) - they've got tons of styles and they're really great prices unlike a lot of other athletic wear brands. Their regular shorts are meant to be rolled at the waist so if you don't roll them they'll just be high waisted. That's what I do with them because I wanted something that was comfortable with my stoma and that looks good, which these definitely do! They have different fabric types too, so you can get regular cotton stuff, swishy gym style or form fitting yoga type. I have a few of each and I highly recommend them!

TooAfraidToAsk,fcojn18,t1_fcoettx,1577833888.0,"But that's not even remotely the point of this post? OP didn't say they didn't like bad kids or any specific behavior, just that they find them annoying in general. On the contrary, they actually pointed out being annoyed by happy children giggling and playing, which is pretty much the opposite of what you're referring to. This post didn't ""point out one type of kid"" in any way whatsoever, and they didn't generalize any specific behavior traits, good or bad. 

Comments like yours are more of an issue, trying to villainize people who don't like/want children, acting like they're personal preferences or opinions are ""moronic"" just because you don't agree with them. I mean you either feel personally attacked by people who don't like kids or you didn't actually read the post here"

Some people don't like cats/dogs, not all cats/dogs are assholes and act a certain way, but it's just personal preference. I'm well aware that not all kids are bad but I personally just don't like them myself. The big difference is that people who do like/want kids tend to shit all over the people who don't - Why wouldn't you want kids? Every woman wants a baby, why don't you? Only a monster doesn't like children!. For most of us who don't want/prefer children ourselves though, we don't hate on the people who do.

I would've found it concerning if he would get jealous or upset about something like that, that's just ridiculous. The love you have for your child is different than the love you have for your significant other, but it's not something to get jealous about. Has your wife ever shown signs of extreme jealousy before? And I'm sure some people might find it ""sexist"" to even ask, but is she possibly pregnant or on her period? Because I could see that reaction being from hormones in certain situations, but other than that it's definitely completely uncalled for.

Work, exercise, sex - anything you can think of, you can still do. I have never come across something where I had to think about if I could do it or not because of my bag.
