TheSilphArena,ffbgtld,t3_esotgt,1579764661.0,"I’ve traded and traded and traded so many Alolan Vulpix, I finally ended up with one with nearly perfect pvp IVs. Bought the 2nd move, too.

If they release it, again, with a better move that I’d have to evolve into, I’ll be frustrated.

Just let us TM to the move, and call it good."
pokemongo,ffbb2ie,t1_ffbav0v,1579758097.0,"But even then, let’s say you want to TM a legacy Hypno. He has 6 different non-legacy charge attacks, so you might still need to use 5 TMs just to cycle through to the one you want."

Good. God.

I believe that any move you learn once should be freely accessible, afterwards. Then have a move lock you can toggle on and off, so you don’t switch on accident.

Bam - problem solved, and it’s fair!"

TheSilphRoad,ff84vpj,t1_ff6t9st,1579666058.0,"No problem! 

Keep in mind that that’s only for Great and Ultra leagues, and Master league still wants 100% IVs, since there’s no CP limitations.

Lastly, just to throw an advanced strategy wrench in the mix: CMP was just now changed, as of Jan 21st, to be given to the Pokemon with the higher attack stat.

If you don’t know what that means, and are new to pvp, don’t even worry about it."
TheSilphArena,ff80o0f,t1_ff7udrv,1579662926.0,It’s live. People have been testing it.
TheSilphRoad,ff6korp,t1_ff6asb5,1579629256.0,"I totally know, but hear me out - there’s easy math involved, and it’s all logical:

So, those two leagues have a CP cap, but what is CP? It’s just an arbitrary number that signals the general power level of a Pokémon. CP is mostly meaningless.

So, what we want to do is manipulate that CP to our advantage. 

> Fact: Attack stats affect CP by 1.5-2x more than Defense or Stamina. 

So, if you have high attack, you’ll reach that CP cap faster than you would with low attack. Boo, hiss! 

If you have lower attack IVs, you’ll be able to squeeze more Defense and Stamina under that CP limitation. And since what we want are more stats (as they’re all relatively equal in quality) we gladly take less attack for more Def + Stam, as it pads our stats more."

At the drugstore, we saw loads of specialty acne tools similar to that, but they looked like mini torture tools! 

A bunch of sharp, metal tools that looked like they belong on a dentist’s work table. 

Would pokey metal objects from the drug store, explicitly stated to be used or acne, be a good replacement to sterile needles?"

We are in the process of expanding our classes to 2 times per week, as well, so some of what you said does hit the mark.
