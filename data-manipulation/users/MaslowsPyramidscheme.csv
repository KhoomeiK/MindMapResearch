TrollXChromosomes,ffhnvhz,t1_ffhg2mk,1579944474.0,My therapist and I call it emotional literacy. And some people are just emotionally illiterate. Sometimes people who are highly emotionally literate feel like they are being dismissed when someone who isn’t as emotionally literate attempts to navigate certain interactions and they come up short.
AskReddit,ffgznvu,t1_fffcsi8,1579919201.0,"My mum is the same way. People are complex and empathy is a lot of work! She just asks me now if I want to vent to her or how she can be supportive because I said something along the lines of “I know this is irrational, but I just need to say it out loud. Can you just listen to me?” I really appreciate the effort she goes to to extend herself for me and I’m sure the people close to you feel like this also."
AskReddit,fff8jk2,t1_ffd9c24,1579878380.0,"I appreciate the sentiment but feel like this is a little dismissive. Most people know worrying doesn’t help a situation, but anxiety isn’t rational and attempting to apply a rational response isn’t effective. I know this concept is hard for some people to empathise with but I think what OP said was great because it acknowledges the stressor and shows that the partner is supportive and present without fixating on the situation."
AskReddit,fff839i,t1_ffd8asx,1579878065.0,"I prefer to be told that I’m appreciated / valued. There are a few reasons why: a) an action may be thoughtful but unsolicited, I am a very independent person and prefer to ask for assistance than to be given assistance without my expressed consent. b) actions can be more overbearing as they have a direct physical impact on you, I sometimes feel like this undermines my control of a situation and leaves me with little agency. c) I have obsessive compulsive disorder and sometimes actions can trigger a compulsive response if the action is not done “correctly” 

I know people can just say anything but there is something so incredibly tender about being with someone and then revealing their inner most thoughts about you verbally, telling you “I’m so glad you’re here.”"
AskReddit,ffb0s1n,t1_ffaxip0,1579748965.0,"I wonder if when people say quirky they just mean someone who is unabashedly themselves in their interests, values and negotiation of the world around them. Maybe? Someone who isn’t worried about fitting in and just wants to lead an authentic life ? A kind of confidence in their convictions - liking what they like shamelessly and expressing themselves in a way that seems unrehearsed? I dunno. Because the stereotype of quirky has become the antithesis of it."
AskReddit,ffb0ey9,t1_ff95oq6,1579748718.0,I think in particular a sense of humour that aligns with your own. Being able to have a seamless tete a tete of jokes with a partner is great.
australianvegans,ffapsbf,t1_ffaan8f,1579741639.0,I agree ! Oat milk is the best
relationship_advice,feyjh05,t1_fexug4h,1579446303.0,"I think OP could even word it in such a way that wasn’t hurtful but really more of a request: expression of desires. “I would really love it if we focused on me for a little bit,” or “When you do x it feels great, can we do that more often?” 

I don’t think penis size has to be an issue either. It’s important to develop the confidence to say what you want so that you are satisfied, a good partner will appreciate it."
AskReddit,femk7or,t3_epyrmi,1579259750.0,I moved out of home really young to go to university and couldn’t afford lessons. I have been living in a major city that is well connected by public transport and haven’t really had a need for it. I was also crippled with anxiety and when I started learning found myself having panic attacks. I want to learn how to drive though! My brother is going to teach me. For reference I’m 27 now.
facepalm,fem9245,t1_feky50w,1579244252.0,"I went to art school for painting, not in the US, but I would say that almost all the professional artists I know are university educated and it makes a significant difference to their art practice/ ability to engage with contemporary discourses."
AskReddit,fem5ck4,t1_fektzt6,1579240312.0,"Oh man, it’s part of my profession but it can be expensive. I would purchase large sheets or rolls of high quality cold pressed paper or plan draws.

I already have a massive work bench, easel and drafting table, but plan draws for storing work would be great."
AskReddit,fe31g3q,t3_ennslu,1578845010.0,"Communicate clearly with your partner about how you feel. As a couple a disagreement should be a problem you attempt to solve together not “fight” over. 

In all relationships including non romantic ones;
Be kind.

Be patient.

Compassion is free.

If you are unhappy with any relationship you can end it, family included. 

There are exceptions obviously and sometimes this courtesy will not be extended to you and that isn’t fair but kindness and patience are good ways to avoid feeling anger towards others. 

Also consider being kind and patient with yourself."
MakeupAddiction,fe2rlr2,t3_enhvpb,1578842080.0,"Hello! I also have trichotillomania (as a symptom of my OCD) I don’t do my brows but my poor legs look shocking. Eyebrows are tricky even if you’re working with a full toolbox anyway. 

One of the things that I do to make my eyes pop is using complimentary colours. I have blue/grey eyes so I often use a warm reds / oranges, either as a wash all over the lid or I really like doing a coloured liner at the moment. 

It looks like you have green/hazel eyes, so maybe using a cool dark purple, burgundy or maroon colour would really bring them out ? It doesn’t have to be too bold, I know there are some subtle purple liners that almost look black but are just a tad more interesting."
BeautyGuruChatter,fdzqz0q,t1_fdqzi00,1578793784.0,"I was struck by that too, particularly as someone living in Australia, currently experiencing one of the worst natural disasters in our recorded history. She clearly comes from money and privilege, use your own money for that mate and don’t expect a pat on the back. It just reeked of poor taste."
AskReddit,fd9qr2p,t1_fd3fwc8,1578236837.0,My boyfriend does things like this and I feign ignorance until he uses the correct word.
relationship_advice,fd734j8,t1_fd36f8s,1578198838.0,"I agree completely - I was struck by the compulsive need to touch the clothes/ rub them between his fingers. 

I also think that the barriers to communication are typical of young men who have been socialised to feel uncomfortable expressing how they really feel."
cats,fck54ul,t1_fck3l1g,1577716871.0,"A scrub turkey is a native Australian bird that builds a mound for a nest ! They aren’t super big but Bagel had never seen one before. 

They are pretty kooky. A bush walk is like a hike, but y’know, a walk in the Australian bush."
relationship_advice,fcjuxto,t1_fcjsebo,1577705985.0,I actually used how extreme this reply was as a catalyst to tell him about this post and we both laughed about the idea of me ending the relationship over this. He is going to find a new pet name.
relationship_advice,fcjuh07,t1_fcjtrn8,1577705325.0,"I’m happy to be direct, but I’m not sure what that language looks like. I already tried once and I was wondering if I should bring that conversation up again ? Or do I wait for him to say it and just say hey remember how ages ago I said I didn’t like that name ?"
