Let’s take a famous mythical example: Thor, the god of thunder. He is often known as Thor Odinson, which just like Slavic names ending in “vic”, denotes that Thor was Odin’s son. So too were people called “John Clarkson” or “Peter Branson”, to denote their father. But after a while, those “son” names became independent names in their own right... just like OP is doing with Petrovic."

todayilearned,fc5od7e,t1_fc5lztu,1577462590.0,"/u/brwonmagikk has a point in general with actors/entertainers being artificially promoted, but he is wrong with regards to Jimmy Stewart.

First of all, Stewart wasn’t drafted but instead voluntarily enlisted, almost a year before Pearl Harbor occurred. Because he enlisted, he had a measure of control over his assignment, which was the Air Corp (the precursor to the USAAF). Since he was one of the very few enlistees already certified as a pilot, his skills were very much in demand. Upon completing pilot training with the Air Corp, he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant, just like all the other pilots. 

He was promoted to 1st Lieutenant along a normal timeline, and the rest of his promotions came as a result of the huge expansion of the USAAF and the numerous deaths of other officers due to the very high mortality rate of other bomber officers. 

And trust me, he earned each promotion. A common misconception was that Stewart only flew 20 bombing missions (which was the amount required of the airmen before they could be grounded), but it was actually more than that- how much more, we aren’t sure, because Stewart ordered that after 20, his missions remain uncounted. Needless to say, he was one of the most experienced bomber commanders in the Allied forces by the end of the war.

Jimmy Stewart was extremely private about his war record and experiences, and very rarely talked about them, and never let studios use them for advertising purposes. The only time he was recorded on camera talking about a mission was in the documentary *The World at War* where he talked about his involvement in [one of the deadliest bombing missions of the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Raid_on_Schweinfurt). During his brief interview in the documentary, he is only identified as J. Stewart, and his acting career is never mentioned."
