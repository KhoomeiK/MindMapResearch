popheads,fep0mu4,t1_fenj4rg,1579309492.0,It's not a personality flaw if she does drugs like Im sure tons of musicians will do coke or something before they perform. I'm just saying it's clockable to anyone who's done coke before
popheads,fen7w3l,t1_fen72i1,1579278907.0,"word is she's a lil bit of a druggie m friend once met her while she was being interviewed at  my cities radio station and first thing she said to him was ""do u have a cigarette?"". I'm not judging though I'm one too"

YouShouldKnow,fdsylat,t1_fdstr47,1578709628.0,so you understand why koalas can't give humans chlamydia right?
YouShouldKnow,fdsqgz2,t3_emyez1,1578706624.0,That is not how it works. the strain of Chlamydia that koalas can get infected with is not the same as the kind humans can be infected with.
YouShouldKnow,fdsq7or,t1_fdsi3z0,1578706524.0,This is factually incorrect siv( simian immunodeficiency virus) is not the same as the strain that can infect humans
ucf,fdlmizn,t3_elzcr9,1578527394.0,"just use a dating website or go to a bar, unless they're me other people would probably just assume at face value that you would just want to be friends or study buddies at the least. it's also kinda creepy I imagine that ur just doing homework or going about ur own business and some guy u barely know is trying to make you their SO"
