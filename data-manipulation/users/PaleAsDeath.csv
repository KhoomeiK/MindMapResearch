I've been in a lot of abusive situations throughout my life, but only a few of those situations were due to narcissists.   
My parents were one source of trauma, but that is because they were developmentally arrested themselves.   
My summer camp was another source, but that is because the counselors there just didn't know what they were doing.  
Public school sometimes was, but again that was because some teachers didn't always know what they were doing, or didn't have much empathy, etc.  
Boarding school was another source, and there were two people there who where genuine narcissists, like clinically diagnosable kind of narcissists.

TwoXChromosomes,fevdp9e,t3_eqpc39,1579396218.0,"So, this was shared by a girl I am fb friends with.   
I grew up in a really rural, impoverished  ""white"" area. 23% my town's population under age 18 lives below the poverty line. The city they mention in their comments is a similar area, though a little more city-ish and less impoverished than my own.   
The girl sharing this is a woman of color from a large city, so I understand that seeing rural white poverty was maybe a new experience for her once she moved to the area.  


HOWEVER  
This post is mocking people for being impoverished. The people who live like this in this area-- overweight, old stained cheap utility clothes, lots of babies (she's carrying a babydoll in the first pic), addiction, poor health habits, cheap food (one pic is a dish that is supposed to look like canned beans, and corndogs)-- are this way due to poverty, lack of education, lack of access to mental health resources and a more general lack of access to support resources in general.   
It's cruel. It's in poor taste.

I generally consider this girl to be empathetic towards people who are marginalized. So I don't understand why she so casually mocks the poverty she sees in this area.  
I feel like if someone who was hispanic held a poor-rural/indigenous mexican person party, or if someone who was black held a poor black person stereotype party, then this girl would consider it to be offensive (which it would be).   
It hurts that she doesn't even seem to realize how offensive a ""white trash party"" could be, and then she goes on to personally mock the real people she sees everyday here who are the target of the stereotype."

ADHD,feuz0l9,t1_feuxhzo,1579391358.0,"I am very hyperactive. I need to exert that energy physically and cognitively. If I don't exert that energy, if I just repress it, then I become really depressed. Like clinically depressed. (edit: I mean if I repress it over a longer period of time, like several days or weeks, without an outlet for that energy, then I start becoming clinically depressed)  


However, I know  most people consider it rude/inappropriate to be fidgeting/looking around etc when listening to them. I know it's also considered rude/inappropriate to get up or move in meeting, like classes, too often.Therefore I have trained myself to mostly control my urges to physically move/fidget/do things to occupy myself to keep myself focused etc. So I can appear as if I am not experiencing a deep, visceral urge and need for activity. I can appear somewhat normal.

However, that veneer of normalcy has become my personal ""norm"" for social situations with people I do not know well.Therefore, when I tell people, like my GP, that I think I have ADHD, they tell me that they don't think I do because they don't see me fidgeting, and if I ""really"" had it I would be moving in my seat more."

I'm sensitive to rejection and how people treat me too.  
It kills me when I'm trapped in a situation where people think I'm stupid, and I have no proof or indication otherwise.   


For the last two years of high school my parents sent me to a cultish boarding school. I was an excellent student before. But this school was awful all around, and incompetent, and I couldn't handle it. I didn't do very well there. People treated me like I was dumb off the bat, and then when I didn't do well their suspicions were confirmed. Then, because I did poorly, I was afraid to apply to top colleges, which before had been a realistic possibility. I did really well on the SAT, and the teachers there were all like ""I heard you did well, I was really surprised""  
Its very frustrating for me now that when people are trying to feel me out and ask where I went to college, I can't be like ""i went to \[excellent school\]"" to counter the ""dumb"" impression."

OutOfTheLoop,fepkzwk,t1_fenvakr,1579323257.0,"Idk, no offense intended, but her choice of tattoos (for example, the black 5-pointed-star tattoos on her face) indicated even back then that she maybe wasn't the best at decision-making.   
Like...tattoos fade and spread/become fuzzy over time. Yet she chose black ink for the stars, which starts turning blue when it fades.   
That grey-blue faded color clashes with her skin tone and clashes with the warm-toned makeup colors she likes to wear.  
She also often defines one star with eyeliner, which highlights how faded and smudgy the other ones are--and since small pointed stars are very angular, the fading/spreading is very noticeable.  
She could have avoided those issues by choosing a more ""human"" color for her face tattoos, and/or choosing shapes less sensitive to spreading/fading.

Each decision is intentional and serves the story.

* hyperfocus OR lack of focus
* Disorganized and messy
* Forgetful 
* Problems completing tasks 
* Daydreaming and in a world of her own 
* Takes time to process information and directions; seems like she doesn't hear you
* Looks to be making ""careless"" mistakes
* Often late (poor time management) 
* Hyper-talkative (always has lots to say, but is not good at listening)
* Hyperreactivity (exaggerated emotional responses)
* Verbally impulsive; blurts out and interrupts others
* Seems to get easily upset 
* Highly sensitive to noise, fabrics, and emotions
* Doesn’t seem motivated OR may be exceptionally motivated
* Doesn’t appear to be trying 
* Seems shy
* Appears withdrawn
* Cries easily 

Possible symptoms of OCD in children:

* Worrying about germs, getting sick, or dying.
* Extreme fears about bad things happening or doing something wrong.
* Feeling that things have to be “just right.”
* Disturbing and unwanted thoughts or images
* Excessive checking
* Excessive washing and/or cleaning.
* Repeating actions until they are “just right” or starting things over again.
* Ordering or arranging things.
* Mental compulsions (excessive mental reviewing)
* Frequent confessing or apologizing.
* Saying lucky words or numbers
* Excessive reassurance seeking (e.g., always asking, “Are you sure I’m going to be okay?”).

First, go to a doctor, or the school nurse, and tell them that you need to be treated for depression, suicidal thoughts and insomnia, and that you also need a therapist.  


There are some things you can do on your own without medication to improve your sleep. Some tips:

\- make a consistent sleep/bedtime routine and stick to it. Get ready for bed and go to bed at the same time every night

\- drink water before bed- Don't drink caffeine (energy drinks, coffee, etc) after noon. Some people are very sensitive to caffeine and it can affect you for many hours; it could keep you awake at night/in the evening if you drink it in the early afternoon or later.

\- don't look at screens or have the lights on past 8:00pm or 8:30pm at night. Exposure to light at night decreases your melatonin production, which is a hormone that helps you sleep.

\- take 5mg of melatonin supplements (you can get them in a grocery store)  at night a few hours before sleeping- Make sure your room is dark. Get blackout blinds if you need, and dont have glowing electronic lights on (like when charging) in your room.

2. The whole ""African Japanese surgeon with cerebral palsy on the train with three other identical strangers on the train"" thing. Yeah there's a lot of people. Yeah there is diversity. But it's nothing like that. I understand it's hyperbole, but even still, that is too extremely hyperbolic for the situation. Like, yeah, you aren't going to stand out solely on account of being biracial. You aren't going to stand out solely on account of being a surgeon. But it's not like there is no standing out."

TheHandmaidsTale,fd77ed5,t1_fd76opj,1578200399.0,"The issue is that Margaret Atwood wrote the book with a specific lesson in mind--that a loss of rights gained could happen in the United States. She spent however long it took for her to get it right.The goal for the show writers is to make something entertaining, that will get lots of views, and that extends the story. Their goals are fundamentally different than Atwood's.That is why it is so difficult, even with ""good"" writers, to maintain tonal consistency when going off-source"

My mother is like a teenager in a lot of ways. Like she never took that final leap of  neuro-cognitive development that begins to hit around 16-19.

My father was more like a 12 year old.   


They both had advanced degrees, yet lacked some ability to modulate their emotions, to identify the source of emotional problems and solve them, and to make risk-assessment/judgement calls.   
I outpaced them both emotionally by 15/16, but was still beholden to them, and that was traumatic."
