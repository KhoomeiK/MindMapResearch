Divorce,ffptwsf,t1_ffmew6q,1580105557.0,"The divorce happened when the kids were teens -- both in high school 12 yrs ago after 25 married 30 together).  He amazingly offered me 100% physical and 50% legal before we even settled (not really sure what legal did for him with teens since they do what they want).  I also had it written in the divorce that the kids pick their own college and topic of study with no parental veto and we each pay half.  I paid my half even with less salary just to get this in to protect the kids.  

Visitation was the kids choice, no set schedule.  The older one stopped seeing him at all within a year when he pushed the woman in the kid's face and the other kept going.  Younger was pressuring the older to go (I am sure at dad's insistence) so it made some strife in my house between the kids.  But all in all I am so very thankful they were older when this happened.  I would have been a basket case sending little kids to his house.  And having that woman there too."

leanfire,ffpt31y,t1_ffnapdz,1580104688.0,"It will also not deal well with 5-10 years of projected income when the amounts are not related year by year.

It will also not deal at all with an ex spouse's projected benefit since it is illegal to enter the site with someone's info other than your own.  But if you have records of ex spouses earnings you can certainly easily come up with a projection so you know how you might fare if half of theirs is more than yours or, if they die.

My experience with folks who work for certain gov't agencies (and I spent 10 year with a gov't agency myself) is they think things are much more complicated than they really are.  For example if the IRS would write reasonable forms rather than take line 5 and multiply by the diameter of the donkey's ass and divide by the length of the elephant's penis, then subtract that result from the half the amount on line 33.  Take this number and choose the lesser of line 33 and 15, then multiply times one third of you age and put this on line 44.  Etc.  Then the average person could not only calculate it but actually understand what is happening.

The latest example is the new W4.  What a joke.  I ignore it, estimate my taxes and put in a number.  Then by April 15 I go online and do an estimated withholding since I am even more sure what the final number needs to be to cover me and avoid a penalty."

leanfire,ffk595l,t1_ffk2qj0,1580016288.0,"And if you are a ""non-standard earner"" it is much more accurate to use the real calculation.  The calculator assumes you will continue earning like you have been earning the past year.  

I am FIRE with one or more part time fun job(s).  I don't plan to make a income that is steady or even is related to the last year I worked.  My current year income may not even be enough to knock out 1977 (currently my lowest of 35 that is not zero) given the inflation factor applied to 1980 --  5.3321867.  While that calculator on My SSA may be great for the average Joe who makes a career and continues it to retirement, it does not work well for some of us who are bouncing around working for fun.

Of course the inflation factors are only out up to 2020 so I have to guess at those beyond that (every year 1977 goes up a bit as do all the rest of the years).  But assuming we don't go negative I can estimate that pretty well, or at least bound the bottom."
Divorce,ffk4g7n,t1_ffk2kdb,1580015535.0,"Yes I know.

You made me think of another one.  I rarely left the kids.  But I agreed to pick a friend up at the airport (3 hr round trip) and left him with the kids Sunday afternoon 1 and 3 yrs at the time. 

I get home to a kid (the one year old) with 103 deg F and a raging ear infection.  She had been screaming for 2 hours. I do not believe he had even taken her temp. Our kids were very prone to nasty quick forming ear infections.  Her eardrum was bright red (I had an otoscope, it was that bad).  He was waiting for me to come back rather than calling the doctor.

Yes there was an on-call doc in our office and they had me bring her right in.  Yup got antibiotics.  Grrr.  Why would he not help his kid?  Needless to say given the color of the cold medicine incident, I was the one who administered kids meds."

Divorce,ffk2gvg,t3_eu0bjf,1580013762.0,"I am still going to say NO, NO and NO again.

The level and type of debt you have indicates that more of a mindset change is needed and throwing your 401K at it will not be a good long term solution.

Also consider that you may well add an additional $20,000 plus to the debt during the divorce unless your spouse also wants the divorce and agrees with a settlement.

You need a complete budget makeover.  Credit card debt needs to be prioritized for elimination.  No further purchases should be made on the cards.  Shut them down.

Take your salary minus what needs to be paid for taxes and allocate the rest.  A good chunk for the credit cards and minimize all the rest.  Look at what you buy for clothing, for food, shut down entertainment.

Consider getting rid of the two car payments and purchasing two used cars, cash.  Consider getting a personal loan to pay off the card debt (some credit unions will do an unsecured loan).  The higher percentage interest for an unsecured loan will still be way below credit card interest.  If you are rid of the car loans you should qualify for a personal loan.

You may also have too much house.  Consider downsizing or renting and use that to wipe the debt.  Get back in to home ownership when you have figured out how to live within your means.

None of this will help unless you create a balanced budget and stick to it.

Yes you will split the 401K in the divorce but you will also split the loan payments.  It is a wash.

Don't do it."
Divorce,ffk1mys,t1_ffk0lxx,1580013055.0,"Yup, given the limited info any of these is possible.  Given the way the OP wrote though, I know which way I am leaning towards believing it is.  LOL"

Divorce,ffk1etz,t1_ffjhl6n,1580012858.0,"Just do her a favor and make sure she can at least find the money.  Leave a printed asset statement, list of accounts passwords, credit accounts etc for her.   I see so many older folks where the husband has a sudden health issue, and the wife ""doesn't know where the money is"".  Could be the other way around, but those currently in their 80s and 90s tend to have the man at the financial helm.

Frankly it is still not all that hard.  Monitor the snail mail and email (his) for a month, run a credit report and but the end of as quarter you should have a pretty good idea where the money is even starting from nothing.  But there is no excuse for this situation ever happening if the right data is left where the spouse can find it."
Divorce,ffk0u85,t1_ffj9gjk,1580012362.0,"I think that will depend on how unbalanced the workload is and if he complains about how you do yours, especially if it is more than 50%."
Divorce,ffk0qz2,t1_ffjf49z,1580012285.0,"I think that mentality is pretty common with sole wage earners.  I dealt with that too.  It was one of the reasons I did not go back to work (did 11 yrs married making more than he did until the kids came along).  With the kids and the house and all the ""stuff"" I already had a full time job and knew that it would not change if I got a job.  I am not going to be superwoman and bring home the bacon and fry it up, watching him play after work and I keep on working and working.

I did go back to work once he left me for the OW, and it was fine.  I am capable of working and taking care of my stuff (and the kids) but at least I didn't have his too and no one to tell me I loaded the dishwasher incorrectly when he never made a move to do it himself, etc..."
Divorce,ffk0aj3,t1_ffjg774,1580011901.0,"I agree with you.  

I don't wax my shoes, never did, even when working a professional desk job.   And I don't spend hours and hours cleaning.  I do what is required to keep the family healthy and not a bit more.  I value other things.  Some women (and probably some men) seem obsessed with cleaning houses.  

While I have always had a general budget, I do not participate in Quicken usage to track every single expense.   I have a good general knowledge of where things go and what level of expenditure is acceptable, and use this to determine what we can and cannot buy.  I would have a problem being married to someone who demanded I enter every tiny expense into Quicken or that I pack my lunch daily.

I think one potential issue with the OP is that she and her husband do not share the same set of life values.  Perhaps he sees nothing wrong with spending as it come in (lunches out) and not budgeting, and of course she does not share this method of monetary flow.  Perhaps he enjoys lunch out but does not spend on a gym membership.  How would we know.  Maybe the gym membership would be an acceptable expense for the wife, while lunches out are not?  

So bottom line is they may not be comparable in their general view of how to live life and what is important.  And, if that is the case there will be nothing but bitching and resentment for the length of their marriage."
Divorce,ffjyv7v,t1_ffjwalg,1580010746.0,"Me too.  I mowed the lawn, raked the leaves, changed the oil in the cars, fixed the lawnmower, contracted for any home repairs, waited for service people, painted rooms, bought the car and house insurance, paid all the bills, bought all the groceries, passed him $20 bills when he needed money and on and on.  If I waited for him to help I would never have gotten done.   He would rather bike, canoe, run etc.

This one had two degrees in engineering and he even came to me with a cold and said ""do I take the purple one or the orange one?""  They were both the same drugs.  But he had already take a does of each at the same time.  Yes he could read, but chose not to."
Divorce,ffjyhp7,t1_ffj1gn3,1580010444.0,"It is about finances.   Most of what she is nagging him about and bitching about in her post has to do with her saying he doesn't take care of finances.  For some reason OP seems to think her husband is solely responsible for finances and when he doesn't do it or learn she admits she nags.  I disagree that this must be his responsiblity.

There is only one other little negative thing mentioned and it is about packing a lunch.  That is easily solved.  Ignore it and he can buy lunch or learn to pack one.  I am sure he didn't starve before he met her.  Sometimes women are enablers.  My ex mother in law had an excuse that she could never go anywhere around noon because she had to make him a sandwich.  I am quite sure this man was capable of making his own sandwich, but my ex MIL created this need in her head.  Maybe this poster is too?

Everything else about him, is positive.  And those positive things are things that some of us would die to have from husbands.

I stand by my opinion.  As long as he doesn't mind her taking control of things financial, she should stop nagging him and do it, or leave."
leanfire,ffjxwdc,t1_ffjifrf,1580009978.0,"I would just calculate the SS benefit myself.  The formula is not all that hard.  There are three parts and from your earnings it sounds like you only need to do the first two.  Make a spread sheet and take your earnings from the Myssa site and multiply them by the inflation factors, pick the best 35 and do the short calculation."
Divorce,ffip5ww,t3_etuot4,1579979251.0,"I am the type your therapist spoke about.  I enjoy doing all those things, taxes, budgeting, investing etc.  I especially enjoy being able to do it without having to fight someone on how and what to do.  If you do not step up and do the finances, it will be a problem.  You cannot have a family where at least one of the people is not interested in doing these things, or at least paying a professional to do them properly, which still takes some effort and understanding.

I am not sure why you want to nag.  Either you want to step up and take control of your future or you don't.  It does not sound like he is stopping you from taking the reins.  If you divorce him, you will be single and just as responsible for these things anyway.

Either step up and stop nagging, or end the marriage.  You want him to step up and do these things, yet you don't seem to think that you could also do so.  This is not necessarily a ""man's work""."

Divorce,ffdouko,t3_eswzoj,1579825466.0,"I know this is not helpful, but it seems to me the divorce was not well thought out by your attorney.  Why not let the low earner provide the insurance for both kids and take the full amount for tax purposes?  Adjust child support or spousal support accordingly.  I would look for a modification to the divorce to make this all simpler."
Divorce,ffdogu9,t1_ffck0j5,1579825227.0,I disagree.  Many places 13 is old enough that a judge will listen to the wishes of the child.
Divorce,ffdnw2z,t1_ffcoocg,1579824877.0,I have trouble believing this would still exist.  I would put closure in writing and mail it certified.   I would then let my attorney know if they told me I could not close it.  A letter from an attorney should do the trick I would think.  At the very least it should serve to determine who might own any debt created in the future.

leanfire,ffci2sc,t1_ffce3a0,1579799925.0,"Maybe worth it if you have medical issues (and ER trips), but I would rather pay less (or nothing) for the high deductible plan, contribute to a HSA than to pay premiums for nothing.  

My experience on the ACA for about 3 years now is that most of what I want is considered ""not medically necessary"" (vericose vein removal, small cyst removal, etc.) and they will not cover on any plan, or they want so much pre-procedure work to be done (possible spinal surgery for compressed nerve root) that is quite frankly stupid and useless and costly for me, that it is better to just buy what I need with cash (update as necessary the MRI -- $540 no more than every 5 yrs or so) and hold the very cheapest ACA plan as a catastrophic plan until I get really good and ready to let someone cut into my back.  My plan pays 100% after $6000 deductible.  I end up with some well care visits (paid in full) a derm check ($77 contract price to deductible) and maybe some sick visits ($110 per with labs).  Meds are reasonable due to the plan contract prices but also to deductible.

I started with the silver plan and determined that I did not need or use that level of coverage.  Premiums are gone money whether you get anything for them or not.  They lower the deductible, but I won't hit the silver or the bronze deductible anyway so why pay the silver premiums.  If I have a catastrophe, I will survive paying the $6,000 in that year.  It is a very individual decision based on your health and risk tolerance."
Divorce,ffb7bj8,t3_escysd,1579753775.0,If you have been married over10 years make sure you have a copy of his birth certificate and social security card or record.
Divorce,ffb6yji,t3_esjqm7,1579753457.0,"Get the copy of his birth certificate and social security card for sure in case 1/2 of his SS is more than yours down the road. You never know how things will end up in life,   Assuming you were married over 10 years prior to divorce, you will need both of these AND your divorce papers when you file.  If he dies before you, you get the larger, your benefit or his.

Get a copy of his SS data now while you can.  Yours is always available on line from MySSA.

Certain things should also be in the divorce doc's.  For example you may need a termination letter if you are also on his health insurance and your birthday falls after his in the calendar year.  So he needs to be on the hook to provide any termination letters you may need.  I had to sic Social Services on my ex to get this data.

On the Life insurance, beneficiary change.  Do it now.  You are not required to make him your beneficiary even if you are married to him.

On the bank accounts and pay check.  Change the pay check to your own new bank account NOW.  If you need to give him money for joint expenses you can do that, but he does not need access to your entire paycheck.

Forget paying off the balance on credit cards.  Just close them now or temp stop them so no new debt can be added.  Do that now, pay off balance later or negotiate who's expenses these are.  He may owe half.  Tell him AFTER it has been canceled.  You don't need spite charges.

Get a new auto insurance policy now.  Take you and your car off the old one. 

Cell phone.  I agree, get records now.  But get that split as soon as possible so he cannot run up charges.

Most of these things are not required to be joint even with married couples.  Close any accounts you can and open your own single accounts now, in case things get nasty."
Divorce,ffb5d21,t1_ffauhbj,1579752225.0,Yes this.
Divorce,ffb4mpj,t3_eskrlu,1579751669.0,I think that friendly separation is far more possible when both parties desire the divorce.
Divorce,ffb45to,t1_ff9mjur,1579751322.0,"There are many ways to play that.  Packing only vital stuff you want not to lose (which I would do no matter what) and taking your child to visit your parents or whomever makes sense would get you out while he receives the news.  One could leave an email or note (take a photo of a handwritten note before you leave).  The note could explain you will be away for a x amount of time.  How does he prove that you left for good and are abandoning your condo when you have to go for a couple days?  He cools down and you come back and pretty much be silent. If he changes the locks, you get the police involved.  It would be very stupid of him to do that or to try to keep you from home or your child. 

I don't believe (not an attorney though) that leaving for a cooling off period would allow him to lock you out by changing the locks.  I also doubt that you could not come back whenever you want even if you did leave.  You live there too.  How does you being there stop him from ""taking your kid"" any other time?  Where is he going to take the child?

Another way is to set up the service and have a friend in a car down the street if you need help (you say he is abusive).  Leave your phone connected to the friend in case the friend needs to call 911 they can hear what is going on in the house.  That is the best case, they you can have him thrown out and get an order of protection if he is truly abusive like you say.

If you are very worried about abuse, none of the above matters since for your safety you shouldn't be there anyway and depending on who is the primary caregiver for the child is, the child should not be there either if there is no daycare set up."

Some people that had jobs that did not contribute to social security then go on and work 40 quarters at another job that does, get that ss benefit ""deemed"".  I think that is the word.

Divorce,fe3zmzg,t1_fddpniv,1578854378.0,"I don't like the arbitrator, especially if it is binding.

One other thing to avoid.  This happened to me (small $ so no major impact other than me being angry later).  His attorney proposed instead of paying me some sum (under $1000) he be allowed to take my kid shopping for stuff she needed.  Never did I see the results of the ""shopping"" or if anything at all was even bought, or if my kid even needed anything that was ""bought"".  I would never agree to this again.  Cash is king.  If he owes you he need to pay you in legal tender."
Divorce,fe3y707,t1_fdb9qnp,1578853944.0,I disagree.  If he is serious his attorney can send the OP a letter outlining what he wants.  Then she doesn't need to worry about words being put in her mouth and a he said she said.
Divorce,fe3xjji,t1_fdap6o4,1578853780.0,"I would not even take the call, it shows willingness to talk, hence weakness. If you are ok with the current legal agreement, decline the call.  If he is serious, let him file.  Then you can counter with the support numbers you conceded to get more time with the kids..."
Divorce,fe3xchu,t1_fddqhl6,1578853715.0,"So now that he gave up time with the kids for money, he is trying to get the time back without losing the money.  I say sit and wait.  If and when he acts then your attorney can respond.  Don't waste your time and money before that.  If you are not in the system in your state to garnish his paycheck do that so he can't pull the non-payment thing either to cause you more stress."
Divorce,fdcyqmb,t1_fdcgsvx,1578288315.0,"I understand.  They courts can be funky.  I had some that I should have won go the other way and I won some I should not have.  All depends on the judge.  But you certainly want to take this opportunity to ask that he make good on the money he owes you.  Costs very little over what you will need to pay anyway if he actually files for a custody change.  And, it can make him look bad.  I have found that the judge's perception is very meaningful."
Divorce,fdcyk9l,t1_fdcgw65,1578288155.0,"Probably.  What you don't really know is if he really wants more time or it is financially motivated.  Either way, you have only had your divorce for two years.  Why the change?  Courts don't like to continually entertain these types of things.  That is why I recommend sitting and doing nothing.  Don't talk to his attorney directly.  If he wants to file something with the court then your attorney can do what is needed.  It is likely a strategy to get you to give up either money or your kid's time or both without a fight.  People who do things like this are sneaky and think the ex is stupid.

If he wants a change to a legal document, let him spend the time and the money to apply for it in court like he should."
Divorce,fdcybgi,t1_fdcn6du,1578287935.0,"I agree.  I found that when my husband of 25 years (30 together) wanted to get rid of me he found stuff, some of it not even real, to accuse me of.  Maybe it made him feel better.  Who really knows."
Divorce,fdcy8p9,t1_fdcu8ks,1578287867.0,"If they have been commingled, it is very possible that the courts will not consider any financial tracing back.  Usually once you commingle it is over. But I am not an attorney."
Divorce,fdcg4k9,t3_ekgdk8,1578274060.0,"I don't know first hand, but when my ex married the woman who wrecked our marriage, and she filed for divorce a year later from him, she did so in OK and he lived and worked in NY.  So apparently one can go back to a previous state (or maybe even a new one) and file there.  From the paperwork I saw, he was served by someone local to NY.  He appeared to check the boxes and sign (notarized I think) and not attend court in OK.  I gather this from the string of documents I have been able to find, and the timing.  I was about a 2 week turn around if I recall correctly.  So, depending on your states, it is probably possible.  Have one of you file in one state and ask what to do.  There is likely information on the state or county web site."
Divorce,fdcfo91,t1_fdc64yi,1578273742.0,Perhaps he also got a raise and now what he pays you should go up?
Divorce,fdcflha,t1_fdbvk49,1578273688.0,"It is possible that the payments he is making (child support) could be considered payment on the $13850 and the child support is actually in arrears.  At least one could make that argument and get his wages garnished for the missing ""child support""."
Divorce,fdcfg3x,t1_fdbt852,1578273584.0,"Then if he actually takes you to court, if I recall correctly your attorney can add a countersuit for enforcement of the $13,850.   Cuts down on the expensive court appearances.  Make him regret he is trying to do this to you.

Will look really bad to the judge if he is looking to modify custody and reduce his dollar obligation while he has not fulfilled the original conditions of the divorce."
Divorce,fdcfa25,t1_fdba312,1578273467.0,"I also agree with Demonkey 44.  Get an attorney but then minimize time spent by your attorney.  Sit and wait for your ex's attorney to do something that actually requires a response.  No negotiation back and forth that wastes time, just wait for the thing to go to court.  You are not obligated to negotiate on anything at this point.  You have a valid divorce and visitation schedule.  I agree that the judges don't want to see modifications so soon."
Divorce,fdcey9x,t1_fdc1b4u,1578273241.0,Sounds like a money play.  Get an attorney.

401K money can be rolled over to an IRA using a QDRO.  Do not let him cash out what he owes you, it needs to be rolled over so no taxes or penalties are due."
Divorce,fd7m7nw,t1_fcz9i85,1578206625.0,"It shouldn't be but he may try to get alimony out of you.  If he does then his degree that was earned during the marriage comes into play.  Also any difference in the value of the cars needs to be considered.  Since you were working longer you may have more in retirement accounts that will need to be split, or offset by any other assets or debt."
Divorce,fd7ltey,t3_ejnesy,1578206465.0,"Get your own attorney.  You say he was in school during part of your marriage?  Therefore you paid for part of his degree.  Your attorney can use this to offset the income difference so hopefully you don't ow alimony.

It sounds to me like your split should be pretty much 50/50."
Divorce,fd7l8oe,t3_ejzpjm,1578206217.0,Get your own attorney who will look after your interests.   Your attorney will know of a financial person you can use for the information you seek.  Spend a little and make sure you get out with what should be yours.

Divorce,fd7k6sa,t3_ek5f64,1578205777.0,"Depending on how much you have and how it is invested you may not need a trust.  Most of my investments are retirement accounts, 401K 403B IRA etc.  All of these can have a beneficiary designated (or multiple beneficiaries with percentages).  My will covers my house and cars and any accounts that cannot have beneficiaries.

The trick is if you have minor kids, and need to designate someone to manage their funds if you die.  And, to have the kids (as adults) have wills of their own.  This is, in my opinion necessary since I don't want to die before my ex, have my kids inherit, then die leaving MY money to my ex."
Divorce,fd3y74u,t1_fd27253,1578162669.0,"Yes he did.  And for what it is worth, my life is good.  I am forever changed though.  I will never marry again nor would I ever give anyone that amount of trust.  But I am master of my domain and living a good retirement life."

Divorce,fd0ay6a,t1_fd09pf9,1578116238.0,"If I knew what he would do at 25 yrs into our marriage and 30 yrs together, I would have not married him and continued my search for someone that actually understood what love and marriage actually mean.  Then I would be retired with my husband, rather than on my own. 

Not that I cannot take care of myself, but I wanted a partner to share my life with and I wasted 30 years on my ex, and there is no going back for a do over."
Divorce,fd0ajwm,t3_ejg89l,1578116072.0,I would continue the no contact.  Why do you need to say hello?
Divorce,fd09ja4,t3_ejo970,1578115642.0,No I would not have.  I married with the expectation that we would grow old together and help each other.  I believed my vows.  Never again.
Divorce,fd0824j,t1_fcy2gke,1578115028.0,"Not really sure.  They had been playing online bridge (that I introduced him to so we could play together), then he found her there (and I was not good enough any more).  I figured the online game was a good stress relief from work.   Guess I was wrong.

I would have to say she was in the gaming picture for maybe two years, but I am really not sure I can figure that out.  Maybe if I scour emails but I don't really want to revisit that.  How long he was cheating (emotional or otherwise) I really don't know.  We were all busy.  Two active teens, and he worked a lot.  He used to try to give me recipes she gave him.  I stupidly thought she was a friend (of his).  I didn't care about her recipes and they were nothing he would have eaten.

We were in NY and she in OK.  Then my ex decided to go visit his sister in Nashville and he rented a car and drove to OK to see her.  I didn't know that was the plan, only that he was going to see his sister.  Frankly he didn't stay long in Nashville so I have no idea why he didn't just fly to OK.  This was all pre- ""I want a divorce"".  I am guessing he was making some kind of decision in retrospect.  He defended it as ""visiting a friend"" at the time when I figured out he was not at his sister's house.  I guess I was stupid and blind.  But that is how it is when you have been with someone 30 years and have given your complete trust.

She was also long time married (35 yrs ish).  She divorced her husband at the same time my ex divorced me.  Mine took a lot longer.  I think she was the one who convinced him to leave his family.  Later during the prolonged divorce, I had occasion to have an online chat with her (trying to get her to leave him alone so I could try to save my family -- I was too late, obviously) and she was really nasty.  Telling me how awful a wife I was... Like she would know anything first hand about my marital relationship).

Then my ex married her. Pushed her around in a wheel chair all summer (surgery of some kind), then she left him about a year after they married.  She filed for divorce from my ex back in OK (never sold her house she got in her divorce -- still owns it today).  He didn't go to court there, just signed and sent it back.  She remarried her ex within couple months of leaving my ex (divorce was quick).  During their original divorces she told my ex she was abused in her marriage.  I wonder how bad it could have been if she remarried him.  I know what her financials were (Divorce settlement) so I know she was not destitute.  So frankly I don't get it, unless my ex was not the sugar daddy she though he would be.   And he still worked too much (salary no OT $) I am sure even after he married her.

It took him about another year to marry #3.  He can't seem to be alone.

But at least this one didn't destroy my family.  That was done by #2.

I often wonder if I had not made the divorce so difficult if he would have tried to come back after #2.  Not that I would have taken him back but it would have been interesting.  One of my kids once told me during the divorce (18 months), ""Dad didn't hate you but he does now"".  LOL."
Divorce,fcy241c,t1_fcxjj0t,1578073736.0,"Yes it was.  I had no idea it was even coming.  30 yrs together, 25 married.  He already had the next wife lined up."
