UpliftingNews,ffv8afb,t1_ffv3rme,1580258060.0,"I love it. It starts out kind of like a parody, but then it takes it own shape. Some of the stories are done just as well as great Star Trek story lines. Also, a BUNCH of ST alumni make appearances/ writes episodes."

He’s starting a GoFund me to help with his legal fees.

AskReddit,ffbvm6d,t3_esi1iu,1579784259.0,"I worked at a Qdoba for a while years ago. They were basically Chipotle, but with queso sauce. That was like their signature thing that set them apart from Chipotle. Our location was always really busy from open to close, so I was extremely  surprised when our manager came and told us that like 99% of the stores were going to be closing in our state (IL), and we were one of them. They planned on only keeping a few open in Chicago. They told us that if we worked through closing and helped tear down the restaurant, they’d give us all two extra paychecks. So I stayed. I think we all did. The very last day was fun and somber. We were throwing out free burritos to everyone and just kinda goofing off. At the end, I got to keep all the extra queso sauces that we had (they came in a big plastic bag) and a ton of tortillas and some other food. My manager also had like a ton of free burrito cards he could give out. So he signed all of them, and gave us all a huge stack of them. I only ever used a few since... 99% of the stores closed down in IL."
UpliftingNews,ffbcy95,t1_ffb93fa,1579760114.0,"It’s not the same, but it’s kinda like what happened with Arizona’s dick-head, racist, Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Federal courts told him to stop doing racist shit, but he kept doing it anyway, so the federal government was able to charge him with defying a federal order (or something like that). Before Trump pardoned him, he was facing jail time. So I’m guessing if anyone ever tried to enforce a law like the anti-gay sex law, they could be tried and face jail time."
