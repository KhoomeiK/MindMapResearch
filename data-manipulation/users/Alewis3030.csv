BattlefieldV,felljij,t1_feljcit,1579225059.0,"Hey man! There are like two of us! I actually thought hardline was a fantastic game I understand why it’s a bad Battlefield game but it’s a great title and I like the weird game modes they made for it! It’s sad that it never took off, I think if they had gone in a more rainbow six siege direction they would have really blown people away but alas, it was ahead of its time."
CompetitiveHS,fdl69ta,t1_fdks219,1578517763.0,I still think Barista could still win games when played with scion. Because it’s just a relatively huge amount of stats for only 4 mana. If you’re playing an opponent with a lot of board clear or low damage board swipes then the scion starts being less effective but the rush can let you burst through a taunt and use your invokes as face damage. I’ve won many of my games using this strategy and I think it works great but I play in rank 10 to 4 so take my opinion with that in mind. Many players at my rank just can’t deal with that many scions and many just concede the minute barista gives you three of them.

I mostly read a lot of the wiki and got lucky with good builds and items. Hardest thing is unlocking everything and then doing the elevators. Those slayed me.

EnterTheGungeon,fdf37oo,t1_fdf2jeq,1578352278.0,I believe in you friend. But also I had some extra maybe 40 or so hours on Pc before I transferred to Switch so I didn’t come into it fresh. I’ve been around the game for a long time

EnterTheGungeon,fdeuixg,t1_fdeueht,1578346884.0,Oh I totally believe you. I’m not saying that I don’t. I’m just surprised as I guess I haven’t noticed it before.
EnterTheGungeon,fdeuayr,t1_fdefd18,1578346752.0,You get a ton of snarky messages like this while trying to beat one of the secret bosses Of the game. I’m pretty sure that’s the only way to get this message but if the wiki says so....

And you’re most probably right about the Latin phrase. I never was a good Latin scholar so I switched to Biology. But as always history has a certain sense of wonder to it that is always a delight. 

Also since I’m sure only a few will go down this thread long enough, Happy New Years dear friends, I wish we could share a dozen of those Pliny The Elder Beers and shoot the shit on Roman history."

From what I read on the wiki(forgive me it’s been years and years since I took my Latin or Roman history classes) he got to shore with his men, despite their protests and found one of the two close friends he wanted to save. But as everyone was ready to go he sat down and just didn’t get up. It’s presumed that he likely died from fumes from the eruption exacerbating his Asthma and died of suffocation. But it is from him we get “Fortune favors the brave,” as those are rumored to be his words of encouragement to his fleet as they rushed to save people from the eruption."

todayilearned,fcna09e,t1_fcn9s1a,1577807055.0,Yep. He died as the ships in his command were suffocated by ash in the eruption. Dude is a fucking hero. Sees a mountain explode and is like shit let’s save these people!
