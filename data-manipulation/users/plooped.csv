All good questions.  Buuuut I'm not up for that discussion right now.  Op actually responded that he had thought Bernie actually WAS the only one who said he wanted to overturn it and says he still believes Bernie is the only one who lives the ideal.

technology,ffccgf4,t1_ffcbmel,1579796458.0,"The stated 'fact' op placed was that only one candidate openly said they wanted to reverse a specific court case.

The rebuttal included statements of the other 4 top-5 candidates explicitly stating they wanted to reverse that court case.  And one (the most hated on reddit) even already cosponsored a constitutional amendment in the 90's which would have preemptively prevented that court case from occurring.

Rather than accepting that the official position of ALL of these candidates, not just Bernie, is to overturn citizens united, you chose instead to change the argument to ""they took 'dark money,'"" which is a different, if related, argument which would require a whole heap of different context and ethical arguments.

I saw an argument.  I rebutted it.  All 5 top candidates have openly called for the reversal of citizens united. How the candidates choose to operate under the CURRENT rules, the ethics of it etc. Is a totally different discussion.

Also new infrastructure like railroads and roads to service the steel mills, employee training, etc etc.  Plus building the mills will take a lot of time particularly getting their polluting butts through environmental regulations.  Idk, I'll get back to you in 20-30 years and see if the US steel industry is finally growing by any real margin.

Know what I haven't heard?  Evidence that rebuts ANY portion of the claims brought against trump.  Zero, zilch, nada. No evidence presented by trump or any witness that shows the events unfolded differently than has been established, no exculpatory evidence for an affirmative defense.  Nothing.

You all complained about the process because you had no factual rebuttal for the damning amount of evidence that he violated the law and his oaths.

Witnesses were used during the fact gathering. Seems reasonable to call them.  Nothing the dems did was even mildly 'above the law'.  They were given information that he broke the law, and confirmed it, per their constitutional mandate. 

Further evidence has come to light related to Donald trump's criminality in this matter, including but not limited to the executive's GAO concluding he broke the law in an independent investigation, and nothing at all prevents the senate from hearing it but for their clear intent to acquit him as quickly as humanly possible."

My point was that this is different than a judicial trial.  They made no claim in their report that was not supported by properly admitted evidence.  So I'm not sure what you're getting at.  That they should have taken years of appeals to impeach he after he lost the election when they already had specific and clear evidence of crimes committed?  Why bother?  The senate still has the power to do this if they so choose, which they should considering what has come to light since the impeachment.

politics,ff6rq2s,t1_ff6r0jx,1579633493.0,"Sure.  From a practical perspective though:  in a normal trial if the defendant did what trump did the judge would hold a 10-20 minute hearing to tell them they now have to produce everything possible in full with extremely detailed PITA priv logging. The appeals court would take a couple of days to reject the appeal and it would be done.  The process they would have forced here would take years.  Would the dems have won?  Almost definitely.  Is it, from a practical perspective, worth spending years to get extra stuff when there's plenty enough to convict with the facts presented?  No. 

And sure they set a procedure.  But that procedure absolutely allowed the GOP and trump to present evidence.  In fact I recall them openly ENCOURAGING trump to send his exculpatory witnesses or testify himself.  It's not their fault he presented 0 evidence to back his claims.

This is markedly different from the 'we won't accept any evidence we don't personally approve of' approach the gop has taken in the senate.  To equate the two is a joke."

Only the equivalent of a grand jury indictment, which usually consists of less evidentince than presented at trial. But then, this ISN'T a judiciary trial and NOTHING AT ALL bars the senate from hearing new pertinent evidence. 

Further, the house presented enough information for a reasonable jury to convict trump.   There's 650+ pages of documentary and first-hand testimonial evidence that establishes clearly his violations of law and oaths of office.

politics,fenyy31,t1_fenxoon,1579292860.0,Bahahaha.  Can't wait for you to blame social programs and democrats for the deficit.
politics,fenup5k,t1_fentay7,1579291091.0,"That's actually pretty funny, being taken out of context in the same way for pretty much the same reason."
politics,fenqqvg,t1_fenl414,1579289444.0,Their mistake was not saying that BIDEN said it.  That would have gotten them frothing at the mouth.
politics,fennf9x,t1_fenl0sy,1579288173.0,We get it: you don't care about anything that doesn't revolve around your personal enrichment.  No need to be a douche about it.

bicycling,felfw0c,t1_fekws0j,1579221214.0,I had that happen in Pittsburgh in a bollarded bike lane.  Luckily I was facing them so I had the time to get out of the way.
worldnews,fel2fvf,t1_fel24i4,1579212605.0,Well SCOTUS has carved out a limited executive privilege in their interpretation of the the constitution.  Which... the irony of the fact that the people defending trump's use of it likely call themselves constitutional literalists is not lost on me.
politics,fel0w7b,t1_fekcpk4,1579211667.0,Conscience*
worldnews,fel0a3w,t1_fekp1gw,1579211304.0,"Incorrect.  Invoking your rights can almost ALWAYS be used against you except in limited circumstances, particularly around 4th, 5th, and 6th amendments.  All of which relate to criminal proceedings (this isn't a criminal proceeding), and none of which he has invoked (and he can't invoke them for 3rd parties anyway)."
worldnews,fekzstv,t1_fekreoi,1579211020.0,"Your second paragraph does not apply here at all, in any way.   Those protections are 5th amendment protections.  5th amendment relates to criminal trials and can ONLY be invoked by the individual related to specific questions.  It cannot be invoked by a 3rd party, or as a blanket protection, and it is limited in civil trials.  And, in a noncriminal trial (like impeachment which is noncriminal), the jury absolutely CAN view the invocation of the 5th amendment against the person invoking the right.

But that's all moot.  He can't invoke the 5th for other people, and he's instead invoking executive privilege.  It's a completely different part of the constitution and does not carry any protections around drawing conclusions based on invoking it."
worldnews,fekz0u5,t1_fekszd4,1579210552.0,"Blocking his staff from testifying under executive privilege is absolutely a sign of guilt and absolutely can be used against him.  Executive privilege is NOT the 5th amendment and does NOT carry the same assumptions.  It's a blatant fallacy to apply 5th amendment criminal protections to a non-criminal trial outside of the judiciary when the right being invoked is in a COMPLETELY separate part of the constitution with entirely separate rules.

The house and senate can absolutely take his refusal to allow testimony into account in their proceedings.  Nothing at all prevents it.

Further, the executive privilege is very narrow and he's unquestionably exceeded its limits by using a full blanket refusal."
worldnews,fekx8x8,t1_fekvq55,1579209490.0,Well of course they're going to ignore that.  It's a fact incompatible with their perceived reality.  Inconvenient things like incontrovertible fact shouldn't get in the way of one's political leanings.
worldnews,fekwt65,t1_fekixtq,1579209231.0,Lol this is the proper nonsense of a raving lunatic.  I wish the internet hadn't allowed the guys from the street corner holding a Bible and screaming a voice beyond their city block.
worldnews,fekwm33,t1_fek8ewm,1579209114.0,"I mean he barely scraped out a win in the lowest voter turnout election in memory, is extremely unpopular, and the last two elections that focused on his actions as president resulted in resounding losses for his party.  But whatever helps you sleep at night."
mlb,fek6hcg,t1_fek4via,1579193616.0,That would be entirely dependent on the contract.  I'd guess they don't have veto rights on who a broadcaster hires though.
bestoflegaladvice,fek1i1r,t1_feis8n2,1579190597.0,Deeds don't actually hold the title anyway.  It's simply a confirmation of ownership.  Title is a concept.  Though perfecting a deed through recording is the best way to solidify your claim of title.
mlb,fek0shm,t1_fejsq0y,1579190162.0,That's the point though ... He's not employed by MLB.
