The woman wanted to do the phone interview straight away but I was driving so she gave me a reference number. I called back an hour later and gave her name and the number to do the interview.

When I started asking questions she told me I was tentatively hired and to keep an eye out for a follow up email."

cats,ffjqsq0,t3_eu0fji,1580004552.0,"All January 2019 this cat would hang out around my house. When it started getting colder I would leave boxes, food, and water out for her. After a week of below freezing temperatures she finally let me touch her and so on a 16F night I grabbed her took her into the the house. 

Our vet said she was probably under a year old and had never been spayed so as far as he was concerned she was a free cat. So here we are a year later and she is the most pampered cat. Not only does she sleep in my bed every night but she also sleeps on a pillow, on the bed. She celebrated her big gotcha day by peeing in the shower and pooping in the floor.

cats,ffe22mm,t3_et45zi,1579834677.0,"I would recommend seeing your regular vet ASAP in the morning. Cats are funny creatures and will not willingly show any pain. Keep monitoring closely and take notes.  It is so hard to tell what they may be going through. 

If at any time your cat shows labored breathing or open mouth breathing the situation has become an emergency."

My last location has a mobile clinic van that charges at little as $50 for females.  

As always, if you cannot have your pet spayed or neutered it is still your responsibility to prevent pregnancy."

Now that both of mine are in school all day this has been hitting me hard. It’s like a weird form of depression and midlife crisis mixed together. I have six hours to do whatever I want and it’s really meh. The house stays clean so I painted everything last year. I’ve done the landscaping and built flower beds. I don’t have any projects left so I picked up running and I’m thinking about weightlifting. I applied to volunteer at my local humane society but I live in a tiny town and don’t fit with the established and much older ladies already there.

In spring 2018 I took my preschool aged child to our local Busch Gardens for some daytime fun in the kids area they have. I did my best to pick out appropriate clothes for us, not too much or too little and comfortable without being trashy. 

For me this meant a simple pairing of a plain black T-shirt and light blue shorts with sneakers. When we finally made it into the middle of the park to the kids section I began to notice the other moms. There were at least a dozen other mothers there all wearing the same black T-shirt and light blue pants. It was the day I lost the illusion of ever having an original thought."

NoStupidQuestions,fegoq2g,t3_eozogr,1579098912.0,"[This Has a Helpful Chart on the term Lazy Eye](https://www.thevisiontherapycenter.com/discovering-vision-therapy/bid/86752/the-difference-between-crossed-eye-and-lazy-eye) 

Moving forward. I was found to have an issue where my left eye turns inward after several bouts of double vision. Apparently my eye has been a lifelong issue that has resulted in lessened depth perception and headaches. Because I did not have regular exams growing up it was never found. The ophthalmologist found that I had 75% of what was expected. In addition to this I subconsciously use my right eye and my brain fudges the images for me. My poor driving record made more sense.

So to answer the original question, no for many years I knew nothing was wrong because my turn is not generally severe. And when I became fully symptomatic it was sudden and alarming. So not really acquired as an adult just the double vision. I’ve always walked into things and thought I was super clumsy. 


When I am very tired or playing sports for a long time I will begin to have double vision and at this time even people that do not know me well can noticeably see my eye pointing towards my nose. My spouse has joked about smacking my head like an old tv to straighten my eye up. Vision therapy has been a big help in correcting the double vision and I have a pair of prescription glasses with prism lenses in the event of sudden double vision while driving. This was happening quite a lot and is the main reason I scheduled an eye appointment.  I drove four hours away for vacation and then could not see properly for 24 hours before I managed to get an urgent appointment at a local eye drs. Apparently the strength of the prism is ridiculously strong because both lenscrafters and the specialist I saw were shocked."

xxfitness,fdk7xuf,t3_elt5cy,1578498127.0,"Hello! Hello! You’re me from 10 years ago!

To start with, I have never and will never be able to calorie count because I absolutely will spiral. 

My biggest and greatest asset this past decade has been learning to cook from whole fresh ingredients. I know that I need protein, fat, carbs, etc to live so I cook for that. Black beans and sweet potato skillet with a good side salad (mozzarella on the salad if it’s been a strenuous day). Lots and lots of lentils, brown rice, and steamed veggies. Varying fruits for a snack and a treat. 

I don’t know what your recovery has been like but for myself personally OMAD and IF were both helpful for the times when I knew I needed to eat to maintain but couldn’t bear the thought. 

Additionally, it can be nice to make some nutrition related goals to strive for. “Today I want to have more protein than carbs”, “I want to eat 3 meals and be happy with that”.  Again for myself, planning is a big help. I have a daily list of things to do and lunch is always one of them. I also meal plan when I’m in a good head space so I can make sure I’m hitting all the marks in a good way. 

I hope something here is helpful for you. I understand how frustrating it is to just be told count calories and macros over and over again.

Wanted to edit to add: Over time skipping food at events feels a lot less like restriction and more like a reward for the next day because I can definitely feel it when I eat junk now. It’s like a junkfood hangover."
