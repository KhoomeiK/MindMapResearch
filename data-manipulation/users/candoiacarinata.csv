Work which you as an FA probably are not going to be willing to do.

That whole intuitive eating/no restriction thing? It's completely out the window. To properly manage type two, you are going to have to SEVERELEY restrict sugar/carbs most of the time, if you want to avoid all the medical horrors that await you.

All those extra fluffy goddess fat pounds that you think are so harmless? They make you insulin resistant (whether your own insulin or any injections you're taking). Which causes your blood sugar to rise and stay high longer from even smaller amounts of carbs. The fatter you are, the worse this effect becomes. Think you've been good today because you skipped the donuts and desserts? Bitch, you better check your blood sugar because that mexican food rice/tortillas lunch and that small bag of lays chips just put your blood glucose well over 400. This will happen a lot while you remain hundreds of pounds overweight.

Want to reduce your blood sugars without meds/insulin? But you dont want to lose weight? Well, you better go buy a bike and hit the trails hard, every damn day, because ""joyful movement"" isn't going to cut it.

Think you can still eat like shit/stay fat, and just take more insulin? It doesn't work like that, the body was never meant to be flooded constantly with glucose and pumped to the gills with insulin 24/7.

There are a lot of type two diabetics on huge doses of insulin who still suffer and die horribly anyway from amputations/blindness/kidney failure. My mother was one of them. It's the reason I've done everything I can to avoid having to take insulin, because I firmly believe that the unnaturally high chronic insulin levels in diabetics have a part in causing damage along with the glucose.  This idea that ""just take more insulin"" will save you is so dangerous.

If you couldn't do the work to prevent becoming obese in the first place, you're in for a nasty suprise when you realise just how much actual work managing diabetes involves."

Because it looks like a work van, people don't hesitate to park close to the door. I've had to occasionally just wait until they come back and move, or crawl in through the back which is painful and exhausting.

If I park in two spaces to give myself room on the drivers side, some asshole will intentionally park 6"" from my driver door just to make a point about me taking up two spaces.

I park far out in the parking lot? Well thats where all the people with the motorhomes, u-hauls, horse trailers etc want to park too, right alongside the van. Fuck me.

You're right that even legitimate sites and forums have these. The problem is that the sites are getting the ads from third party ad companies. The ad companies don't vet their advertisers, allowing these vultures to run their scam ads, and the legitimate website doesn't get a choice of what ads they are sent.
