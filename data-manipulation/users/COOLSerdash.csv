Yes, that's correct: The output of the model are probabilities for each school head. Strictly speaking, logistic - binary and multinomial - regression models are not classifiers (for more details, see [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/127042/why-isnt-logistic-regression-called-logistic-classification)).

That is a great question which deserves a nuanced answer. In his book, ""The Art of Statistics"", David Spiegelhalter ponders the same question (""What is a population"") and offers three possible answers:

* A *literal* population. This is a concrete, identifiable group, such as ""all men in the UK that are 20 years old"".
* A *virtual* population. Consider the measurements of a scale to weigh people. The population ""measurements of this scale"" is a virtual one because we could always take more measurements if we had time. In fact, the population may be infinitely large in theory (although not practically because time is limitted and the scale will break).
* A *metaphorical* population. Here, we just act *as if* the data-point were drawn from some population at random, but it is clearly not. Hence, we act if our data was sampled from a imaginary space of plausible possibilities.

In your case, you could decide that your sample already is the population because there doesn't exist a larger pool from which the students were drawn this year. Or, you could treat the scores randomly drawn from a metaphorical population of plausible scores. The metaphorical population is assumed very often - although this is rarely made explicit -, think of crime statistics or surgery mortality statistics."

statistics,fegx0j8,t1_fegwvw9,1579104423.0,"Some authors do indeed recommend that (I think Frank Harrell is among them, see his comment to [this answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/19675/what-normality-assumptions-are-required-for-an-unpaired-t-test-and-when-are-the/19677#19677)). The crucial thing to be aware of is that the Mann-Whitney-test does have a different null hypothesis than the t-test. In its most general form, the MW-test does not test for a difference in medians or means. If you assume that the two samples are identical except for a shift, then the MW-test is a test for the median, mean and all other quantiles."

statistics,fegvcph,t3_ep3avx,1579103366.0,"> My question is simple, if Shapiro-Wilk returns a conclusion that data is normally distributed then does that mean that it absolutely is normally distributed?

No, absolutely not. A high *p*-value from the Shapiro-Wilk-test does *not* support the conclusion that the data is normal (the population from which the sample was drawn, really). It means that there is little evidence to reject the hypothesis of a normal population. There are probably an infinite number of other, non-normal distributions that the sample would be compatible with too.

> Or are there special cases where the results of a Shaprio-Wilk return false negatives?

Yes, all the time! As any hypothesis test, the Shapiro-Wilk-test has a certain power to detect deviations from normality. This power will depend on the sample size, the chosen significance level and the specific alternative. Here is an example: If the true population distribution is a t-distribution with 3.5 degrees of freedom and you repeatedly draw samples of size 30, the Shapiro-Wilk-test has only a 38% probability to yield a ""significant"" *p*-value (assuming a significance level of 0.05). So in that case, the test has a whopping 62% probability of yielding a false-negative result, i.e. a type 2 error.

Can you elaborate why you think you need normality?"
