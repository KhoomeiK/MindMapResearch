interestingasfuck,fflixsy,t1_fflbm5c,1580040214.0,"I had American car. Biggest mistake. It was 2013 Ford explorer. When it was still under warranty my serpentine belt tensioner broke 3 times, transmission was rebuild  back up camera stopped working, door seals came off, rear door latch broke door wouldn't close, tire pressure sensors stopped responding, and 3 months after warranty expired steering rack stopped working it cost me $2000 to replace it. So I got rid of the turd I i drive German cars."
