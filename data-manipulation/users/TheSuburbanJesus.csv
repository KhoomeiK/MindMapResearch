To be clear, I'm specifically criticizing Yang's implementation. I'm not against UBI as a concept or a plan to be implemented, only that I feel Yang's is short sighted and will cause more problems than its worth. I believe his plan, from what I've read from his website, will hurt the growth of the working class more than it helps. 

Medicare for all is the idea that you have medicare void of restriction, corporate involvement, and suffocation in the form of a spouse, job, etc. Yang's implemented, which closely aligns with that of Pete's and Biden's, offers a more affordable plan while still allowing private insurance to compete and drive up prices. America's medicare problem isn't just a matter of access, but one of corruption and greed as well. While you can disagree that M4A is not the solution, it does not change that Yang does not support M4A by its agreed upon definition. 

His unappealing conduct is an opinion of mine, not a fact. But for me his general rhetoric (I suppose the ""bro"" title is semi-appropriate) comes off as joking and unprofessional. Furthermore, a specific case of inappropriate behavior that comes to mind is him pouring whip creme into his supporter's mouths."

But in short, it's closer to conservative implementations if ""medicare for all""

Furthermore, I'm not arguing in favor of welfare programs. But Yang's policies as a whole do little to combat the systemic issues that exist and oppress people today. To be clear, I'm not against UBI - I'm only not in favor of Yang's implementation of it."

I was wrong then, but now we understand what we have to save America against. And with trump’s approval at 40% already, him being impeached, and now him starting a war in a desperate attempt to win re-election - he doesn’t stand a chance.

But unlike trumpets, the average person can comprehend basic concepts like reality. We will win in 2020, and you’ll get the help and care you desperately need. Don’t worry, we won’t abandon you and America like you abandoned us."

You need severe mental help if you get off on causing suffering and pain as much as you do. You're lucky that the harm you do to our county isn't considered treason, or you might actually have to face the reality of what you're supporting."

Trump is gone this time next year. And he will forever be remembered as the greatest mistake in US history. But thankfully all you trumpets will get M4A soon and you’ll finally be able to seek the mental health services you so desperately need."

Also the narrative that people are after your poor pitiful billionaire dictator is laughable. The only reason he wasn’t impeached until now is because Democrats didn’t support it. Funny... they don’t tell you that in your narrative do they? 

And you speak of coincidences? How about a president who had bragged about sexually assaulting women, dodged the draft, partied with underage girls with Epstein, conned college students, framed innocent children for the sake of having them killed, makes up blatant lies defending on how the wind blows, went back on everything he promised, publicly bragged about welcoming foreign intervention into our election over 3 times, has never worked a day in his life, screams at anyone who gives a detailed report, spends 1 in 5 days golfing at his resort paid for by tax payers with money that goes into his pockets, betrayed military alliances overnight (and subsequently started a genocide) simply because he wants property in Turkey, has attacked and labeled journalists as the enemy, attacks US Citizens for being here and saying they should be kicked out for not agreeing with him, one of the largest employers of undocumented immigrants.... I could go on and on and on, but I’m getting tired. The facts will remain facts, and you will continue to blatantly ignore them to enjoy the false narrative you’re told to parrot. 

The only coincidence here is a man who has spent their life having never worked, been given everything, who spent their life through crime and poor decisions, suddenly being thrown into the White House and becoming a Good Samaritan? Yea tough shit. If you believe that then I’ve some beachfront property in South Dakota to sell you. 

And the best part about calling you out on your lies? You’re just gonna plug your ears and go “lalalalala” simply because you’d rather be told how to think, than to think for yourself. Honestly it’s just sad and pathetic and I hope you seek the help you so blatantly need."

PoliticalHumor,fctkymh,t1_fct7ky7,1577947089.0,"Um, he found insufficient evidence that Trump was not guilty. Meaning the evidence needs to be explored more, but that is outside the realm of his legal power. He called upon congress to investigate the president. And guess what? They did. They found him guilty of abuse of power and obstruction of congress. You should be thankful democrats are letting trump off easily and ignoring 99% of his crimes."
PoliticalHumor,fctkorh,t1_fctgggv,1577946769.0,"I am pissed at congress. I'm pissed that Nunes was allowed to even be apart of the impeachment process when he was guilty of aiding the president in his crimes. I'm pissed that Republicans threw away their oath to our nation simply because they want money. I'm pissed that they lied, mislead the gullible, and continue to stand by one of the greatest threats America has ever faced. 

I'm also pissed that, despite the overwhelming evidence, a few Republican senators have come out and said they will rig the investigation, at the detriment of our constitution, for money. 

Trump being impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of congress was letting him off easy given all the harm he has caused.

He takes money from the rich because he is running for one reason, and one reason alone: his ego. Also he doesn't have super PACs? That's like saying nuclear explosions cause no harm. It's flat out wrong.

You also defend Biden and Warren a lot too. So it seems to me you're just scared and trying to cause disruption to the profoundly impactful campaign Senator Sanders has. Alas, your efforts won't stop the inevitable from happening. Sanders will be our next president, and no amount of your lies or misinformation will change that."
