There could be some really compelling storytelling in there, esp if there's a Byzantine-esque region of space where part of empire still survives.

So lots of doctors, lawyers, etc. They all blamed ""Bernie Bros"" for her loss, and now are saying they might have to not vote at all if Bernie gets the nomination.

I grew up in a rural area in a conservative family - none of them really understood how much the conservative hate machine had poisoned the well for her, and how much her own tendencies worked against her with people like my family. I'd tell them that I remembered riding around in the car with my mom listening to Rush Limbaugh talk about the Clintons doing Satanic rituals and handing out heroin needles for Halloween and they'd laugh, thinking he must have been *joking*.

Management is in a Cargo Cult mentality - they think if they go through the motions and get all the trappings of the new hot fad profitable patients will appear. First it was six sigma, then MAGNET (it was especially pathetic seeing them try to play pretend with that, surface level change will NOT get you magnet status) then lean...bc obviously a plan for just-in-time widget manufacturing will work for delivering healthcare.

While horses do enjoy stretching out for a good sunbathing session sometimes, spending too much time down, especially in a stall where they can't extend their neck and limbs fully to distribute their weight, can lead to breathing problems and pressure ulcers. There is also the danger of becoming ""cast"" which is where a horse has gone down too close to a stall wall or other obstruction and now can't get the leverage to get back up."

AnimalsBeingDerps,fdj57lr,t1_fdj40t8,1578458774.0,"Horses will sicken and die if they cannot walk around unless intense, expensive care is taken. They must stand almost constantly so trying to keep a horse still and off a broken leg is nearly impossible. Then odds are high they will go lame in another leg because of the increased weight it must support now that the broken leg takes none.

At the end of this process there's no guarantee they will be able to physically perform intercourse. Many studbooks (ex The Jockey Club) require live cover so the stallion has to be able to support himself on his hind legs while mounting the mare and his forelegs have to be able to take the impact when he dismounts. A mare has to be able to support both her weight and the weight of the stallion during copulation.

All this doesn't touch on the fact that a lame horse is in constant pain. A horse has to support its weight all the time, and if one leg is incurably lame it will never have more than brief relief."

You've already got the answer. Now you need to start working on a plan to achieve it permanently when he turns two. Get everything set up. In the meantime, look up the Grey Rock technique. Do not associate with them, ignore anything they say to you, insult or not. Be as boring as possible to them and your husband. Give nothing away. You do not have support inside the home, it is time to cultivate Team You outside of it so you can get away when it is time."

He has always been honest if I asked (mostly because one of the flings went full stalker mode so I needed to know about her for my safety). When we talked about what we had been doing during our breakup he talked about doing some casual dating, and I could fill in the rest. He didn't volunteer more details than that at first but didn't hide things if it came up in conversation.

My perspective on it was that he was a free agent and so what he did during our break up isn't relevant to our current relationship (beyond said stalker issues). I hope my experience helps you navigate this. Good luck!"

AskReddit,fc31eec,t3_eft9mt,1577379243.0,"The biggest mistakes I made in OLD at first was taking too long to meet and thus either falling for a profile or getting disinterested without ever having met. By the end of my time in the OKCupid trenches I would meet almost anyone for coffee or a drink and an hour of conversation (provided he or she didn't have any dealbreakers evident in their profile.) Only 4 of those many, many, MANY coffee dates resulted in second dates, 2 resulted in relationships. I'm still with the 2nd of those relationships and we're planning out the rest of our lives together.

I did go to one guy's house after a coffee meet up because he had an absinthe still and I was interested to see his set up. He also had a wall covered in Nazi paraphernalia and photos of Hitler and other Nazi bigwigs that he had photoshopped himself into. I made my excuses and skeddadled. So I guess that's the most exciting thing that happened with OLD. I also dragged a poor man I met at a reddit meetup through a swamp to look at bats at 10pm because I am completely oblivious to flirting and now I realize what he meant when he said, ""I'm having a great time and I'm not ready for the night to end, what are you usually up to at this time oc night?""🤦‍♀️"
