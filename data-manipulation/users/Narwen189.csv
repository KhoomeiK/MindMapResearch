When I'm not actively working on that (I have worksheets I constantly misplace), my go-to is focusing on *accomplishments* rather than looks. For instance, instead of trying to fight the thought ""my thighs are so fat"", it's ""yes *but* they've powered my bike nearly _K in _days"". That usually makes me feel better."

You get some milk (I always buy powdered because it's cheapest) and heat it on the stove with a little cornstarch until it's thickened a bit. Add some sweetening if you have it (or nick some from 7-11).

It's a classic Mexican drink, which you often have with tamales, and can be flavored with fruit, chocolate, vanilla, or just be taken plain. The traditional way would require masa or pinole, but cornstarch has become the most common method because it's easy and cheap.

In hot weather, chill it in the fridge, and whip it up with some ice and syrup for a surprisingly tasty, dirt cheap milkshake.

As an extra bonus, if you leave it unsweetened and add instant mashed potatoes, you can make a creamy potato soup or regular mashed potatoes, but the potato bag will last almost twice as long. When you're broke enough you don't know when you'll be able to afford more food, little tricks like this to help your ingredients last longer are a literal lifesaver."
