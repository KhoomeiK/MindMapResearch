Social Anxiety got me great grades."
socialanxiety,fe57yiy,t3_enf3vb,1578866411.0,"I came here to see if I had social anxiety, but this meme confused me even more.  
I actually have far worse social anxiety amongst some peoples I already know. The more I know them, the more I have this 'anxiety attacks' when I'm at parties or social settings, and also I feel less uncomfortable turning them down and inventing excuses like being fake sick (which I do a lot).

I feel way more invigorated and enthusiastic about meeting completely new groups of people. I used to crutch on someone I know but I've found that knowing no-one is actually better because I just go and talk to whomever is in front of me."
