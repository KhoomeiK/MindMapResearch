Oh yes, you're 100% right, somehow I totally wasn't factoring in the actual diameter of our galaxy.  I was just focusing on illustrating the accelerating nature of expansion. I think even still though, 240,000 years is effectively the blink of an eye at astronomical scales.

And at the same time, 240,000 years is such a long time for technological development, there's no way to predict what great feats we'll be capable of or what human society (or the species itself) would even look like by then.  I don't really see any reason to assume we *wouldn't* be sending humans along for the ride at that point.

space,fd3e3tm,t1_fd309m2,1578157428.0,"I don't see how any of this generates lots of electricity. And you do need to generate a whole lot of electricity if you want to use a photon rocket type of propulsion, even with the added efficiency of a solar sail. Where does the electricity come from to power the laser?

I'm not suggesting that your idea would break any laws of physics, what I'm saying is that on a practical engineering level, photon rockets don't work. With all the means of energy storage we have access to, there's no way to store enough energy on the ship to propel the ship meaningful distances.  So instead you probably have to generate energy as you go, but generating energy usually involves some kind of fuel or other external source (Coal, gas, uranium, wind, the sun, hydrogen). You can't take the sun with you, so solar power is out, the best remaining options are nuclear fission and fusion.  But even assuming you're using fusion power, to produce the vast amounts of energy required to move a craft like that (which now inconveniently includes a massive fusion plant) would still need to consume fuel, and the more fuel you carry, the heavier your ship gets.  Now consider that you need to carry enough fuel to burn these photon engines constantly for perhaps 10 years to reach even the very closest stars to us. 

The hybrid photon rocket/solar sail does increase the efficiency a bit, but really only a little bit. Unfortunately the photon rocket aspect of it turns out to be mostly impractical, but, there is definitely some merit to the solar sail aspect.  With ground stations and focused lasers, you could make a solar sail with significant thrust at longer distances.  At long distances, this method of transferring energy would be hugely inefficient, with the sail only capturing a small portion of the beam, but with ground stations you can have that luxury, and it's fine, you just accept the loses.

Also, how do you stop?"
