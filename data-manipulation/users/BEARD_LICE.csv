navyseals,ffed1wf,t1_ffect05,1579843602.0,The thought of highers ripping into some TGs over reddit posts just gave me a good smile.

navyseals,ffbgsps,t3_esftnv,1579764631.0,This is by far the most tame comments I've seen for a post like this.
navyseals,ffbg0s5,t3_espeff,1579763658.0,"Let me chime in real quick before the real answers come in. 

I used to film a lot for my buddies while they surfed and the ""DaFiN"" fins I used would get my ankles sore after an hour or two treading/swimming in the break. We usually surfed ""the shores"" next to Gator, so the rip currents meant you were constantly working to stay in the same spot. 

I wouldn't class my ankles as ""tough"" especially after a torn ligament in one and a hair line fracture in the other, but I can say from experience you can have the perfect fit and they will get sore/uncomfortable."

Nice try though."
todayilearned,ff8cl9s,t1_ff8448k,1579672995.0,"I had a residual smile on my face from the title. I kept smiling while reading the parent comment and then audibly said ""get the fuck out"""
AnimalsBeingDerps,ff866ip,t1_ey1lr39,1579667098.0,"Damn you just brought back memories. 

All baseball players do it but you brought back memories of the slow jog to the mound and the little hop I'd do over the line.

You wanna talk about anxiety? I also was a catcher and the catchers box was always so perfect and square but it simply couldn't last more than a few pitches."

navyseals,fe082xn,t1_fdz0l54,1578805592.0,"I started to read the article and got about 6 paragraphs in when I realized this was more of a autobiography than anything else. 

I skimmed down to where he says he joins at second phase and now I'm really questioning why this article was written."

After the tank quite literally went full GTA through some neighborhoods, it got stuck when it tried to cross the center divide on the freeway. A cop got out of his car and hopped on the tank, opening the hatch and shooting the dude. 

Come to think of it, if he went at the median at a right angle this story would probably be a lot worse.

weekendgunnit,fdfxxkp,t1_fdfv44v,1578373304.0,You just made me realize theres a very real possibility that I could go to this sub one day and it's quarantined.
SmallDeliMeats,fdcj5vp,t1_fdc8r6z,1578276203.0,"Yeah I'd say that's where the bit started when they started doing relationship advice but like others have said I don't think they've ever really ""dragged it out"", it's usually a quick back and forth and then they move on to whatever they found on reddit."

codyko,fcc65qd,t3_eguvrj,1577594854.0,"I really liked it but expected more from a 2.5 year wait. 

When I saw the video pop up I immediately said to myself ""hmm it's only 12 minutes long I thought this was gonna be at least an hour"". That's more than I probably should have expected but then you watch it and it's really only like 9-10 minutes long followed by the credits. 


Having said that, this was such a Noel film and I loved that. Cody cameo gave me a good laugh"
