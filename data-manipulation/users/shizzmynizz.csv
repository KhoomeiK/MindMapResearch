Until people get used to the aiming speed, after that, we will be back where we are and people will still complain about hanzo, then they will nerf the speed again (3rd or 4th time now) and we gotta relearn everything again. It is the most frustrating thing i've ever come across in a game."
Overwatch,fdqg9fv,t1_fdoryg1,1578665908.0,IT doesn't make him harder to play. It just forces us (hanzo mains) to relearn muscle memory all over again and it fixes nothing. Only gives us frustration and wastes my time I spent practicing aiming.

It was up at my father's lodge in the forest, where we had no internet connection, no phones and cellphones (smartphones) were not a thing yet, and for some reason we decided to have a lan party in the middle of nowhere. His family had to come pick us up (me and my 2 friends) but they got lost on the way so we had to survive for 3 days alone.  

We didn't play Crysis tho, I believe it was Heroes of Might and Magic 3. Regardless, the pc's back then ran pretty hot just from MS paint."

That being said, I've used different PC's under these conditions for 15 years and it's never given me any troubles.

Just grab the pc and leave, no need to unhook it (been there too, due to an earthquake in 2010).
