ProgrammerHumor,ff9ym11,t1_ff9uxpn,1579724302.0,"It's a pretty standard ubuntu (well, kubuntu, but it doesn't matter much).

What actually happened might have been more complex, I'm not really sure. From what I know at least the kernel should just start killing stuff when memory completely runs out, but I know from experience that some program (looking at you, all web browsers with maybe-badly-written JS code) can sometimes lock up the system.

So far it's not common enough that I want to crawl through hypothetic kernel log to sort it out. I just avoid stuff that extreme."

ProgrammerHumor,ff9hsku,t3_esalro,1579713306.0,"Funny story. I had around 200MB of data encoded as base64 in a file, and needed to have it all in one line instead of the usual 80ish line cut.

My best idea at the time was to open it in vim, and do a simple ""%s/\\n//"" to replace all newline with nothing. For reasons unknown, the fact that vim took a few seconds to show up didn't raise any alarm in my mind. I started typing, then it froze. Not vim, not the terminal, not even the desktop manager. The computer locked up. Mouse not moving, but still fans at full blast for ten minutes before I finally pulled the plug.

Turns out I have a convenient extension that show in real time what the substitution string I'm typing will do. My assumption is it was trying to apply a regex (a simple one, but still a regex) to the whole file, something around 3.7M lines, and maybe, format the output to display it live on screen."

gamernews,fclxc2e,t1_fclwjmo,1577758757.0,"I get what you mean. Still isn't a free pass for them to spit in the face of the people they supposedly made this for.

There have been projects that were complete and ready to ship, with tons of people behind, that decided to go the ""guaranteed money"" way. What does it tell to people that supported them, sometimes even financially? That we're useless to them. I'm no masochist; if I'm useless to you, I'll just walk away.

I can't tell for \*all\* games that have gone epic exclusive, but for most of those that I carred for, they were not in an uncertain position regarding if people would buy it or not; they had decent following. They made a conscious choice of ignoring that."
gamernews,fclvzbu,t1_fclt0zu,1577757807.0,"Yes. I was not talking about hurting the money they got, but the long term. I know most people won't care because ""free game"", ""cheap game"" or just ""IDGAF"" attitude, but for some it's a big nono.

This move basically mean ""we don't need you as a customer"", and some people will go out of their way to make sure the message is heard loud and clear. I know I'll make sure to avoid people that decided to go along this way.

Again, I know I'm part of a minority here; but if your game is successful, I feel like this deal only weakens the impact it could have in the end, and at best could give you trouble for your future releases. If your game is unsuccessful, well… I guess it doesn't matter."
