gaming,fefavi3,t1_fefaekk,1579052261.0,"I mean I spent the whole time playing it waiting for it to ""click"" with me, but it never did. After figuring out parrying and dodging the game is easy as long as you aren't greedy with hits. It's such a slow game that you can basically master basic mechanics and be patient and GG EZ. The people who have so much trouble with it just button mash and try to deal as much damage as they can. I would say it maybe took me 3 weeks to beat playing it a couple hours each night. 

I was 16 at the time so had nothing better to do, and iirc at the time I was trying to kill time waiting for Skyrim to release."

gaming,fef3u2z,t1_fef3h9g,1579047532.0,"Don't take this as an attack on the game cause these are just my opinions on it, but I didn't think the lore was deep at all. It was lazy to make players ""find the lore"" when really it's just a few lines here or there from random NPC's and bosses. There's not really a cohesive story. The combat is terribly slow, and the mechanics are shit. The game wouldn't be near as difficult with more polished mechanics. I swear to god half the games difficulty is due to the bad mechanics. 

It definitely has found a niche fan base, and I'm happy so many people enjoyed it. I didn't see any of the charm of it though. It was just dreary, boring, and frustrating."

Keep in mind I said 'fanboys' not just 'fans'. Two very different groups. 

I enjoyed the difficulty of Dark Souls, but the sloppy mechanics turned me off. I'm more in to games like Hollow Knight and Cuphead which I think have a similar learning curve/difficulty level, but with tighter mechanics. 

I think Sekiro is a great game though. The mechanics are much smoother and the fights are still insane."

nottheonion,feey2kn,t1_feex6fw,1579043728.0,"Yeah my mom had to hire a lawyer for custody reasons 18 years after the original custody battle. I have a severely disabled older brother and she wanted my dad to pay child support after my brother turned 18 (he is 27 now and my dad sees my brother maybe once or twice a year despite living only 30 minutes away). 

Basically my mom had to shut her successful small business down to be a full time caretaker for my brother since my dad bounced on any responsibility for him. 

Personally I think he should absolutely have to pay, but the court didn't side with my mom. My brother is mostly bedridden (severe Spina bifida and too much time in his wheelchair causes bedsores that are very difficult to heal).
