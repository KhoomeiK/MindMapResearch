Budgets are intended for you to control spending and avoid unexpected expenses. 

Paying with cash in this case doesn't change anything regarding your budget, you're still spending on the booking, whether with cash or with a subpar cpp redemption."

It's much stronger evidence when you can prove that you've called them repeatedly and have them mess up your payments. 

Even if you're in a two party consent state, you should still record them so you can use them to take better notes afterwards and use these notes in your CFPB complaint."

churning,feh99h3,t1_fegw625,1579111795.0,"According to[the sources cited by this SE answer](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/8668/how-many-active-large-commercial-airplanes-are-there), there are ~4000 widebody passenger planes in service, and ~20000 total commercial aircraft in service inclusive of cargo aircraft. 

Even assuming the more generous number of all commercial aircraft, there's a ~0.6% chance per year that you will end up having a flight cancelled due to insolvency assuming you book a random flight every year. The number goes up to 5 times assuming widebody passenger jets, which are going to be over-represented since they carry more passengers per flight.

To put things in perspective, even the optimistic rate is similar to the US monthly average flight cancellation rates of [~0.7% by the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/airline-time-performance-cancellations-equal-lowest-rate-ever).

This is just flight cancellations too. The axed insurance also covered tour agencies, tour companies, hotels and so on going bankrupt, which while less high profile can still affect your holiday to an extent comparable to airlines going bust."

/u/Smash_Dawg 's explanation is correct, but to add on the mistake you made in your attempt was that you converted r*dr/dt (r times rate of change of r) into d(r²)/dt (rate of change of r²) in the 6th step. This isn't allowed and is the reason why you came up with an incorrect answer."
