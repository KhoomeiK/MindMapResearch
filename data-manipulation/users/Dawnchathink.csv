Sims4,ffykcsw,t3_evr101,1580348497.0,"I am building a world of uni graduates. I think I am up to 80? Anyhoo, back when I only had ~60, I had all of them buy lottery tickets. It took a while, but I thought surely one of my sims would win, at last. They did not. Jesminder & Arun Bheeda did, so I quick dropped the rest and took the Bheedas to Torendi tower to build their dream condo.  Since my sims are all unlucky, I have decided any sim that wins is my sim. Damnit."
Frugal,ffyaybs,t3_evvdew,1580342118.0,"Those shows are old, right? I dont know about the extreme cheapskates, but I actually really got into couponing several years ago and got some very good deals. Like, very good. One time I had so many coupons and credits that I ended up with a negative tab and had to grab $18 worth of laundry detergent to complete the transaction. I didnt buy a toiletry or cleaning product for several years because I had so much stock. I still have a box full of couponed bar soap that cost pennies or zero, along with odds and ends of other stuff.

People got so well-versed in couponing that manufacturers and stores closed some of the gaps that were being exploited. Couponing is nowhere near as favorable now so I dont do it much. 

Also, there was a downside to it: I had to store all the stuff. When we moved, I had to move it all. A couple of ckeaning products separated and weren't really usable after sitting around for several years (not a big deal, 99% of the stuff was fine), and lastly, years later I still have a few products leftover that I dont want to use. My preferences have changed (I have gone more low-toxicity) and yet I do not want to waste the stuff. I might have only spent pennies (or nothing) on some if it, but waste not want not. 

I am finally, after about 8 years, nearing the end of my stash. In the interim, I have learned other ways to economize that I feel better about."

You are clearly NTA and wouldn't be if you pressed charges for fraud which I highly fucking recommend. I dont think you will because you seem like a soft touch, but perhaps you should take those totals to your mom and make her pay you for them or hand over her car, with title signed over to you, so you can sell it to pay yourself back or something under threat of calling police.

Your husband is the asshole. This is a hill I would die on. If he does not call you and apologize for hanging up and calmly express that you guys can talk about this later, just to discuss whether it was necessary for you to give him a heads up that you were going to cut her hair (NOT TO GET PERMISSION, YOU DONT NEED PERMISSION), and then follow that up by telling your 5 year old little girl that she looks beautiful and he loves her and her haircut, then you should really think long and hard about the kind of man, husband, and father he is.  Me? I wouldn't budge until I got all of the above. And when I got home if there was any backpedaling on his part, I would plan another trip.

Then it turned out...it wasnt. When the drums didnt work out for him, it was fine because it was a choice to not play them. He didnt have to think about how that dream died for him. Then his sister comes along and she actually likes it. She is living his dream, the one that died! He isnt being stubborn or selfish (well, he is, but it's for a reason), he is struggling with the reality that sometimes your dreams dont live up to the reality FOR YOU, but they do fir other people. It is a really tough life lesson, and he hasn't learned it yet - he needs help learning it. 

Talk to him. Really talk to him about the dream and how it didnt work out and how it might (or might not) work out for his sister, but what's important is learning why it didnt work for him which will help him figure out another dream that might work for him."

relationship_advice,ff500wh,t3_erlndb,1579576603.0,"Everyone saying it is deeper than dishes...sure, maybe it's the other chores, too. And maybe it's because he was raised to not take responsibility for chores - he was just given his two (mow the lawn, take out the trash) and thinks that's all there is. But it doesnt have to be deeper than that. That can be all there is to it. He might literally not be aware of how much work is involved in maintaining the cleanliness of a home because he didnt give a shit/didnt see what all his mom or dad did, and just knew that all that was expected of him was his two measly chores, and he never bothered to learn more than that. So his girlfriend is a nag who is too lazy to do her own chores and needles him (in his opinion) about it, but hey, he does his bit, right, so what's her problem? And why the hell are there so many dishes, man - they never had that many when he was growing up, right? Mommy never needed his help, so gf must be plowing through dishes like they are paper towels. And then, when the light finally starts to dawn on Mr. Obtuse that a lot more chores were actually happening, and not by the chore fairy, he thinks, well fuck that. Mom only expected the two lil chores, so gf must just be unreasonable af. Of course he had a tantrum. He is a child. 

Oh, and he should get a serious come to Jesus and/or dumped.

But is that really deeper? It's chores. I mean, yeah, it's that he isnt a fully developed adult, but it's not a communication issue or even a couple's therapy issue, necessarily - it's a plain old deficiency in him."
