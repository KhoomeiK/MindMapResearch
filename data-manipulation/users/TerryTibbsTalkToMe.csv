I’m all for shooting, but only in the way its allowed here. Those guys over the pond seriously need a reality check,"

TrueOffMyChest,ffest9f,t1_fferxt8,1579863852.0,Its always worth a shot I guess!
TrueOffMyChest,fferg1k,t1_fferdf4,1579861861.0,Yeah like I said I just needed to get it out. Posting it here was the easiest way for me. I’ll figure it out one way or the other. Thanks for taking the time to chat though.

Family don’t get it because they see how happy she makes me when things are good, they can’t grasp the behind closed doors stuff because I am genuinely a better person with her in my life, its why I want things to work so badly but its just getting harder and harder."
TrueOffMyChest,ffeqjt5,t1_ffeppkq,1579860533.0,Thanks for the kind words
