BreakUps,ffqa2l2,t1_ffq9gyq,1580127753.0,"You’re only 3 months out of a 3 year relationship, it’s perfectly normal, especially given the news you just got. If you were in love with her, at this point you shouldn’t be fine, it takes much longer than that to be okay after losing someone you loved like that. 

I wouldn’t start dating yet, you need time to yourself, and if you were to start dating, that resentment might accidentally end up on whoever you’re seeing, which may make you look like a shitty person, but in reality you’re just hurt and need time alone right now. In the mean time, while you wait for counseling, I suggest finding something to distract you each time those feelings of resentment creep up. Maybe you can listen to an audiobook or watch tv or okay a game on your phone that requires your full attention, or maybe you can pick up a hobby, like learning to paint or something like that. Keep yourself as busy as possible, that will help stop you from ruminating on your past relationship."
BreakUps,ffq91mq,t3_eumgj6,1580126542.0,"I assume this recently happened? If so, resentment is perfectly healthy and normal... if a year or two from now you’re stiff feeling the same level of resentment, then I would say it’s unhealthy. 

It’s normal and healthy to be angry that you were betrayed and you’re feelings were dismissed shortly after breaking up, allow yourself to feel those things. Give yourself time to get over this, it won’t happen overnight, that was a long relationship. If you’re concerned that your feelings about her aren’t getting any better, then I suggest counseling. It may take a few different counselors to find one you like and feel comfortable with, so don’t give up if the first couple don’t feel right. In counseling you can go through all your feelings about her and what happened and figure out exactly where they are coming from so you can eventually let them go. It really is helpful if you have the right counselor, it just takes some time and work to find them."

AmItheAsshole,ffma622,t1_fflcvj6,1580051293.0,"I understand your frustration at people assuming those who look abled are actually abled and faking a disability, I’ve certainly been assumed to be abled countless times, but that isn’t what OP is saying at all, they’re saying that they’ve kicked out people with FAKE service dogs. As someone who I’m going to assume is disabled (due to your passion on this topic, possible even having a condition like Dysautonomia), this should be a good thing to you. Fake service dogs are easy to spot, and if they aren’t, then who cares? They’re not bothering anyone. There’s tons of people who buy a vest on amazon for their Pomeranian and then throw that Pomerania in their cart at target and go shopping around pretending that dog is a service dog... that dog doesn’t have to do anything and I would know it’s a fake service dog, someone with a real service dog would never put their dog in a shopping cart, it’s not sanitary. Or those people who bring their dog to a restaurant and the dog sits and begs for food the whole time and the owner feeds it under the table, that dog is also a fake service dog, I don’t have to assume anything about that persons disability status to know that dog isn’t a real service dog. That person may be completely paralyzed from the neck down, but that doesn’t change the fact that they are faking having a service dog. Someone who is educated enough about service dogs can easily spot fake ones and kick them out of their establishment, without  assuming their disability status, that’s not even part of the conversation. Op is not kicking people with SDs out because they don’t look disabled, they’re kicking people out because their dog is clearly not a trained service animal. 

You directing your anger at op like this will only make people more ableist, not less. Instead of op leaving this conversation now knowing that sd certifications are not a thing in the states, they are leaving the conversation thinking “damn, that person was a huge dick who attacked me for no reason”. If you wanted to point out that certifications aren’t a thing in the states, then say that, but don’t accuse them of discriminating against people with disabilities by throwing them out of a store just because in their country, there is a SD registry and SD require certifications. Your comments didn’t teach OP anything, they were just hostile and rude for no reason, and were likely should have been directed at others who have questioned your disability in the past, not OP."
AmItheAsshole,ffm7w9x,t1_ffm42ce,1580050082.0,"Because this is becoming a bigger issue, more and more people are faking service animals, it’s very possible that the laws that protect service animals and their handlers will change. That’s the biggest threat. Airlines have already banned certain breeds of dogs, which now makes it harder for those to fly who have those breeds as ESA or SD’s, and there’s plenty of establishments that will harass or not let in those with real SD because of their experiences with fake ones, which can be really stressful for those who are disabled and have SD. Additionally, people with fake service dogs often go online and pay for a fake certification for their dog, which they show to all the establishments they go into. These certifications are scams, not a single one is real, however, if an owner of an establishment is frequently being flashed these cards, when someone with a real SD comes in, they may demand to see this certification, and when the handler tries to explain that they don’t have one no certification exists, the owner may get upset and kick them out over it. false information is spreading which is hurting the SD community. 

Imagine everywhere you went you’re scared someone is going to accuse you of faking your disability, because so many others fake their disability and service dog. It’s fucking awful, especially since having a disability for the most part (not including being deaf and a few others) fucking sucks and we don’t want to be disabled, why would we fake it? like OP said, their sister doesn’t even want to go anywhere now because of how she’s treated because she has a service dog. A service dog is supposed to give you freedom, not limit you, and that’s what’s happening, those with SD’s are being limited by their dog because others are faking having a dog.

In terms of the laws changing, right now service dogs are protected by the ADA, but there is no service dog registry, anyone can train a service dog and there’s no certification process. This is a good thing for those who need service dogs because not everyone has 15k to spend on a professionally trained animal or has years to wait on a waiting list for one, this allows individuals to train their own dog, which typically takes 2+ years. But because there’s no registry or ada certified service dog trainers, this allows anyone to claim their dog is a service dog and they don’t have to prove it to anyone, because there is no proof available. With more people faking SDs, this law may change, and there may become a SD registry in an attempt to limit fake service dogs, which only punishes the disabled who have service dogs. This will either mean that all service dogs must take an obedience and task test once the dog is trained in order to become certified, which sounds fine, except it will cost money, and likely a lot of it, something more people with disabilities don’t have, and is just another loop people with disabilities have to jump through in order to participate with society, or, the ada will certify SD trainers, taking away access to self train a SD and ultimately making SD unattainable for a lot of individuals with disabilities because they can’t afford the 15k+ upfront. Both of these things punish those with service dogs and the community really doesn’t want any of the laws to change, except maybe that those found to be faking a SD are punished more harshly."
CrappyDesign,ffm3jlh,t1_ffl0kth,1580047941.0,"Eh, most people know what they mean though... companies use the term “BOGO” a lot, which translates to “buy one get one”, and that also doesn’t have the “free” at the end, but everyone knows what it means anyway.

The Latin part is slightly trickier. Spain colonized most of Latin America, and the rest was colonized by Portugal and France, and all three of these cultures and languages are derived from Latin, therefore we call the people who are even just partly descendent of these three country’s settlers  “Latin American”.

If you’re looking for a mask that filters the air, Vogmasks are great, however they aren’t capable of filtering out bacteria or viruses, only large particles that viruses/bacteria may be attached to. They’re  more used for air quality issues, for those living in urban environments with lots of smog or those with severe allergies/sensitivities to certain smells/contaminants. I have one and once in a blood moon when my mast cell disease is flaring badly, I’ll wear it to help limit my symptom so . I don’t think I even know of a mask with a filter that is meant for daily use that has the ability to filter out something as tiny as a virus.

therewasanattempt,ffgeq6b,t1_ffgboa7,1579904584.0,"You’re absolutely correct on this, especially when it comes to more intimate care, like gyn, gi, and urology doctors. As a kid I had severe ulcerative colitis and spent much of my teenage years admitted to hospitals. If you’re unaware of what UC is, its when your immune system attacks your large intestines, and my large intestines was completely covered in bleeding ulcers, which meant I needed blood transfusions regularly from how much blood I was losing. I also very frequently had accidents, and one night, I woke in the hospital and tried to quickly go to the bathroom, but being hooked up to the iv and bp chuff, I ended up shutting myself and just sat on the bathroom floor crying because I was so sick and so exhausted and didn’t have the energy to clean myself up. My mom was frazzled and my male nurse came in and my mom promptly requested a female nurse to help me clean up and shower because I didn’t want to be naked around a male nurse at 15. There’s nothing sexist about that, it’s just part of being a teenage girl and if I had to be naked covered in shit around someone, I wanted it to be a woman, not a man. 

However, you can’t really apply this to black verses white peoples... there’s likely cases where someone  has been raped by a white man and if the only options are a white man and a back man to do your pelvic exam, this person may request the black man, but often those situations are more obviously not racist and are a result of trauma, not bigotry."

Affirmative action has no impact on teachers (I am a teacher), because there’s tons and tons of 4-year schools that have 100% acceptance rates, and even if you weren’t excepted into an education program and did your bachelors in something else that isn’t as hard (no idea what that would be tbh), you can easily get your certificate through an alternative certification program, many of which have 100% acceptance rates due to teacher shortages. 

I’m not sure what you mean by you wouldn’t want a black police officer... are you saying if you were hiring police officers, you wouldn’t hire a black one? Or you would choose to get get arrested by one? Unless you’re hiring police officers, you don’t get to choose what color the police officers are that serve your town/state. Just like the other professions listed above, just because you’re invited to the police academy doesn’t mean you’re going to graduate, and if you do graduate, being invited in has very little to do with your ability to be a good police officer. 

It’s very unreasonable to refuse treatment by any black doctor, affirmative action has no impact on their ability to care for you. If you want to argue that you should have gotten into med school, fine, but it’s completely ridiculous to argue that actual MD’s who are black are shorty doctors based on the fact that they got into med school and some other white guy didn’t."

A hospital is going to do their best to avoid lawsuits in general, not just the ones they will lose, because even the ones they can win will still cost them time and money and possibly bad publicity if a news organization reports on the lawsuit prior to a decision being made; most people aren’t smart enough to wait until a decision is made in court to make up a decision about the hospital. So if a racist is in the hospital demanding a white provider, the staff will likely accommodate that patient even if they’re short staffed. The damage a racist can do within a hospital goes beyond hurting themselves unfortunately. 

But yeah, it becomes even messier when the patient comes after an individual rather than the hospital all together because you’re not just losing money and possibly earning a mildly bad reputation as a hospital, you’re destroying the career of one (or a few) individuals, like in cases where nurses are sued for being told not to do what they’re trained to do. 

Putting medical staff and a hospital in that position to begin with just because you’re a racist asshole is just all around shitty because it’s not as simple as “just let them die” in most cases."
