What we need is steady movement away from private insurance, which the ACA was the first step of. The most important thing our country could do is improve it. Improve the rates of the ACA, the deductibles, and the enrollment. The more people who join in, the less private insurers can charge. It provides competition and a baseline price which force other insurers to match or lose their client base. Eventually, it should be able to choke out most of the private medical insurance companies, and at that point, when it has a critical mass, we can shift to a M4A scenario because it won't effect the market.

People break the law 1000x a day. Most police officers understand that not every infraction is deserving a ticket and fine. Which is why I can see police officers not stopping jaywalkers and red light phone operators.

They (police officers) know better than most how their job is (at least) two-fold. One is preserving the peace, protecting citizens, and being what most of us think of when we think Police Officer. And the other job is a tax collector for their municipality. Often times officers have to decide which they will be, because not every infraction needs to be enforced. 

Furthermore, there are a multitude of ridiculous laws on the books in many if not all municipalities. Many of those are disregarded by police because they are not serious, and do not put lives in danger. (like for instance, it being illegal to chew gum in public on a sunday (or something to that effect)). I would argue that using your phone while the car is in park at a red light, is not an infraction that threatens the safety of the citizens. (Mind you, using a phone while the car is moving is a completely different story, and should be always ticketed.)"

And while, the games they produced slowly got worse and worse, most people didn't realize it because the IPs were very strong, and so people were able to gloss over alot.   


I feel like SWTOR was their jumping the shark moment. because they transitioned into MMOs, they were forced to add a ton of new devs, and move around their senior devs, just to make it. It was a good game, still might be, but what it cost bioware was their soul. After that, with their core team spread over several studios, they couldn't develop a clear vision of their future, of their IP's future, and of what they wanted to bring to market. So they reverted to copying. They copied (poorly) from their old games (ME:A), from games like Skyrim (DA:I), and Destiny (Anthem). Each time they copied, they lost something in the translation, and the magic for each just wasn't there.

Its far too early to use engineers, geologists, and scientists. The only specialized jobs you need in the founder stage is botanists for a farm and medics for an infirmary, otherwise, all your colonists will be working in service buildings. I know some folks like to have scientists, but I actually wait a very long time before adding to my research, as the research facilities drain electronics, which is a very expense resource and requires alot of infrastructure (rare metals mine, electronics factory) to produce on mars.   


In regards to perks, most are good, but I do prioritize taking Composed, Hippie, and Religious.   
Composed and Religious helps with sanity, preventing sanity loss and also stopping suicide. Hippie helps because early on your gonna fill zones with a lot of decorations, as they are cheap and require no workers. Also, having a good amount of the population be religious provides a good boost if a saint becomes recruit-able later  


In regards to founder flaws, I avoid taking any in the founder stage. If I must (say, if there's a botanist with composed and religious and 1 flaw), then I'll take glutton. I always tend to focus on always having a surplus of food, and even a small number of farms can sustain a very large population. So someone eating 2 shares of food is fine by me. The rest of the flaws I avoid until I can get a sanitarium, and then i only take flaws which i can cure in the sanitarium. Never, ever take idiots.   


Also, in regards to founder's ages, I always stick to youth. Usually I can get the first 12 colonist be all young, but if not, then 1 or 2 adults will be fine. Later on I'll take on more adults, but never middle-aged, not unless i have the forever young breakthrough.

Nuclear powered submarines and aircraft carriers are the same as a nuclear powerplant. Nuclear material produces heat through radioactive decay, which then heats up water, which spins a turbine, and then creates power. On a ship, that power is routed to a turning propeller, which uses the friction of the medium (water) to propel the craft forward.

In space, there is no medium (no Air, no water) so a propeller in space would do absolutely nothing.

Setting off a nuclear bomb as a means to achieve thrust is not feasible, because the gamma radiation would cause any crew to suffer from exposure, and the electromagnetic pulses being produced would ruin all the electronics on board. EDIT: But there was a plan for something along these lines, called Project Orion. It never really got alot of traction, as the costs for development and the inherent dangers were just too high a hurdle. 

What a nuclear powered spacecraft is, in actuality, is a nuclear reactor (similar to a nuclear submarine) but rather than heating up water and using it to turn a turbine to generate electricity, it would instead heat up hydrogen gas, causing it to have more energy, and then expel the high energy gas out of a nozzle to propel the spacecraft forward. This would allow for more thrust per lb of fuel onboard. (EDIT: this is known as an Ion Engine, because the gas is being ionized prior to being ejected from the nozzle)

This idea was scrapped, not because it wasn't feasible (it was possible to be made even back in the 60s), but rather, due to the inherent dangers of launching materials in space, it was deemed to dangerous to launch nuclear material into the high atmosphere where, if an accident occurred, would have devastating consequences for a very large area around the accident."

Trading is one thing, and its very niche and most don't engage with it. I enjoyed being a space taxi. If you find a good route, you can make more $ per hour than almost any other part of the game, except for maybe mining void opals. Mining is the real draw for many pilots. It's got aspects of exploration, trading, and combat all rolled up into one. Hauling home a full cargo compartment of void opals is extremely stressful, as NPC and PC pirates will be looking for you. it adds a lot of excitement to the game outside of combat. 

And combat is also niche, personally i've avoided it, mainly because i didnt get the game to be a fighter pilot. Most combat ships are cheap, and meant to have a smaller insurance cost. You can fit larger, more expensive combat ships, but theres not much point. Going into combat with an Anaconda would be overkill in almost all the combat zones.   


Also, every pilot knows never to fly without a rebuy, and getting credits is easy enough that it shouldn't be difficult to always have 3-4 rebuys worth of credits in your bank. One 2 hour session of space taxiing can net me close to 300 mil, which would cover the rebuy of almost any ship. 

Honestly, Elite:Dangerous doesn't have limited options, and usually, those who think it does, really suffer more from a limited imagination. Its a galactic sandbox, but as with any sandbox game, if all you see is the sand and not what you can make the sand into, you'll find your experience with these titles lacking."
space,fdhbrzf,t1_fdh8su7,1578419555.0,"Its definitely more new player friendly than it was years ago. I remember when the game first came out I spent alot of time grinding. 

Last december i came back and like i said, I was able to fully kit an exploration ship within 2 weeks (in prepararion for Distant Worlds 2)

Also, horizons is great. Being able to ride around on the surface with an SRV is just too much fun and a great change of pace for the intrepid explorers"
space,fdh8nv0,t1_fdh5wj2,1578417780.0,"Took me all of 2 weeks to get, and outfit a top tier exploration ship, and an extra 400 million in the bank. Compared to most MMOs, the grind in Elite is actually pretty quick"

(but at least I don't have to worry about anyone sniping my planetary anomalies before I bother collecting them.)"
SurvivingMars,fdh367x,t1_fdh1tzq,1578414385.0,"Well, i was more talking about the fact that rare metals can be exported and sold, therefore allowing you to purchase anything else you might need, including concrete. But you make good points. 

Nanorefinement will fix your concrete issue though, upgraded extractors operating without a deposit can generate 4-5 concrete per sol. and you can fit 4 extractors on a deposit (before you empty it)"
