singing,fdrj948,t3_emuhdz,1578685224.0,"If your voice is gone, it can mean any of 4 things: 

1. your cords are swollen

2. your vocal tract is gummed up with mucus

3. your vocal tract and cords are too dry

4. worst-case scenario, you've got some sort of damage happening. 

Maybe 1 and 2 or 1 and 3 both apply.

Try to see an ENT who can scope you before your show to rule out #4, and be sure to follow any advice they give you.

Also, try and see a voice teacher with a classical music background who you trust and comes highly recommended. Explain your situation. There's a good chance they can help you to some degree with some kind of technical facilitation that might get you through it.

Get a nebulizer (NOT a steamer) and use it for a few minutes at a time with a 0.9% saline solution. It mimics the salinity of your natural body fluids, and if it's a mucus issue, it'll thin it, making it easier to blow your nose. If your cords are too dry, it will help to re-moisten them.

Anti-inflammatory pain medications are a MUST. Contrary to popular belief, stuffed up noses are only partially caused by mucus. The rest of the equation comes from an actual dilation of sinus tissue! Anti-inflammatories will cut this dilation down and reduce the swelling in your vocal cords that's a likely cause of your vocal issues. So take some even if your nose isn't stuffy.

Be wary of people telling you to steam or drink hot liquids. Your vocal cords are probably inflamed, and even though steaming and tea with lemon and honey are comforting, taste good, and feel nice on your throat, they can exacerbate swelling.

I'm also wary of pharmaceuticals that cut or thin mucus like Mucinex. Too much mucus sucks, but not enough is even worse.

Most of all, talk or sing as little as possible, and get a shit ton of rest. And break a leg!"
