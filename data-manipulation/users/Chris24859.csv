antinatalism,fff3oac,t3_et0s9t,1579874848.0,"I have noticed that as well. I believe that especially in the age of contraception people have lost a real sense of what sex is all about. Its origin and purpose is reproduction, and our instincts and emotions are only there to support that goal. It happened so many times that people took sex so lightly and were careless with the contraceptives, next thing that happened was a pregnancy. One such instance was in high school when a girl in my class became a teenage mom."
depression,fevaoi2,t3_eqmpv7,1579395188.0,"Life feels like a jail sentence. By chance and pure randomness I exist, now Im stuck here and pretty much have no choice but to follow the path laid out before me and do what I am expected to do, the alternatives are even worse. Either way there is no escape from suffering. The pointlessness of it all is mind boggling."
SuicideWatch,fel1ckt,t3_epnuh8,1579211937.0,This world doesn't make sense. The ones who really enjoy life often die young or become terminally ill while those that don't enjoy life and don't really want to be here often get to live long extended lives. Its like a sick joke.
depression,feh2olx,t3_ep1g5r,1579107889.0,My biggest dream in life is to die in my sleep.
SuicideWatch,fef03q4,t3_eojxxq,1579045048.0,In a strange way the thought of it all being over some day is the only thing that keeps me going and makes life bearable. Reminds me that I shouldn't take life too serious and that everything will be gone and forgotten some day.
SuicideWatch,feemxcu,t3_eoc598,1579037003.0,"Yes. It feels like fate. A simple math equation. Everything, when put together (background, the person I am, my environment, how I interact with my environment, my experiences) will lead to that outcome."
SuicideWatch,fdx3pl7,t3_en96dp,1578764998.0,"That has always been a compelling argument to me as well. The whole charade of life doesn't make sense to me in the first place, it all seems so pointless, so useless. All my attempts to find meaning have been futile."
depression,fdx06oi,t3_en9e6m,1578763991.0,The standard response when confronted with the harshness of life seems to be denial and distraction. If you're not on board with the forced optimism society expects of you and don't keep it to yourself I find that people will ignore and avoid you.
