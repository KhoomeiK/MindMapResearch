smashbros,fetqwxc,t1_fetqbnd,1579378567.0,"You’re basically saying since pro player uses a move, it must be good. Of course I’ve seen Maister. I literally use half of his strategies. It’s clear you have never played GNW. Also, Byleth shares moves from over 6 characters. 

And, you didn’t answer my questions about flairs."
smashbros,fetp797,t1_fetob3u,1579377904.0,"He’s the second lightest character in the game. “Hard to kill” my ass. If you have any kind of kill confirms, you’re able to get him at around 60%. Yes, he has good smash attacks, but the rest of his moveset isn’t that great. Up air and forward air are near useless, side-b is slow and luck based, down b only works against projectiles, and down tilt is almost never used. Also, it’s just “the pros” opinion that he’s annoying. Against certain matchups, specifically top-tiers, he can be. But against everyone else, he’s pretty fun to play against imo. 

Also, what do you mean by “taking off my flair?” It’s still there. And where’s your flair? Huh?"

smashbros,fetmya7,t1_fetmr6x,1579377006.0,"You can literally camp with him. He has pretty decent range with all of his attacks. Also, he’s going to be annoying, just like Link.

Not only is it yet another FE character solely put into the game just to promote Three Houses, but he’s going to be no fun to play against. I’m not saying Three Houses is bad, but Byleth in Smash is ridiculous."
