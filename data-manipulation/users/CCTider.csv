I do question the source when i see people with outdoor weed in Black market states. The stuff i see i can tell is indoor. But with outdoor nowadays, a lot is grown in national forests in America, by the cartels. It's not just hippies in Humboldt anymore. And even non cartel outdoor grows have a lot of ecological issues that are caused.

Now, she's joined our family and has 10+ new uncles/aunts, 3 new siblings, and dozens of cousins (my uncle was from a family of 11, and we're very close). It's been a beautiful reunion.

To assume everyone who puts a child up for adoption, is a sad, naive view. 

There definitely people that had a child removed by the state because of drug abuse. But there's tons of people that know they can't/aren't ready to raise a child, and give them to someone who is capable and eager to do it.

A big difference i notice is the motor. I'm not sure about these new ary ones. But the old ones were 400w (at least the vp210). Then you either get the air or oil pump. The oil pumps are more expensive, but are better for a commercial operation because of cooling ability. The seal car for the new ones are 12.5""

The Chinese ones are 125 watt, and only come with an oil pump. So it'll definitely be slower. It will also probably be difficult to repair anything, and I'm sure customer service would be garbage. The seal bar is about 10.25"".
