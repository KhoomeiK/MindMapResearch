aww,fdi9w0i,t3_elfurf,1578438361.0,My cat especially likes the air bubble things that come in Amazon boxes now. I used to dread stabbing all the bubbles to make them smaller for the garbage...but now the cat handles that shit. It's great.

TrueOffMyChest,fcfa5yu,t1_fc9u1rs,1577627970.0,"What bothers me the most about my immune system is that it reacts to all animals and living things. Unfortunately I'm a stubborn animal lover with a house and barn packed full of pets! The skin on my hands and arms where I touch my pets is always breaking down with eczema unless I keep up with my steroid cream twice per day and wear gloves to handle some of my pets. I'm constantly washing my hands when I'm at home to keep them free of pet dander and fur, saliva, etc. and NEVER touch my face without washing my hands. I take a 24-hour non-drowsy Claritin every day and reallyyy can't afford to miss one or I'll have a really rough day at home. Sometimes my horses cause my windpipe to swell towards closing if I haven't kept up with my allergy med routine. So food is just ANOTHER thing on top of just trying to get through a day at my home with the animals who I love more than life itself! ""Deflating"" is a great word for it! I like how you mentioned learning to really grab onto the foods that make you feel good and learning how to best cook those foods. I found growing a veggie garden this year also helped with encouraging myself to be a bit more interested in food. It was fun to go out and grab a few carrots out of the ground to steam for dinner. I'm lucky in that I am able to eat most fast food. It's natural, organic foods that trigger my immune system, so eating on the road is actually easiest, though not always the healthiest. I hate cooking with a passion so I try to make it more enjoyable by bringing my laptop into the kitchen to watch a show or listen to music while cooking. I also try to keep frozen meals in the freezer for days I really don't feel like cooking. If all else fails, I keep a mountain of crackers in my pantry. Goldfish are my favorite! Meal planning for the week on Sundays helps too. Helps lessen the pressure to first THINK of something you can and want to eat THEN have to cook it. Best of luck! :) Oh, and see an Allergist if you can!

EDIT: And then a Dietitian!

EDIT AGAIN: Sorry, thought of something else. With the meal planning, start small so it's not so overwhelming. I only plan dinners ahead at this point but that alone has helped make daily life with food much less stressful for me."
TrueOffMyChest,fc8dqj4,t3_eggip7,1577532612.0,"I've had 200+ food and environmental allergies/intolerances (some life-threatening) since birth so I feel ya. I have grown to strongly dislike everything related to food. I am SO envious of my dog's kibble...so simple! When I'm really struggling with weight loss (usually when my depression worsens), I supplement with an Ensure Plus Calories once per day. I hate the taste of those and hate relying on them so that tends to motivate me to get back to eating again. I really make an effort to eat SOMETHING three times per day which has helped my mind and body develop a routine. Has helped with appetite. Eating is still hard for me though boy do I ever feel better while doing the things I really love when I'm in a good food-eating routine. No more periods of sudden fainting, nausea, and weakness. One doctor told me my immune system may be ""atopic"" which led me to some interesting research online."
