NatureIsFuckingLit,fdltvum,t1_fdlk2qh,1578532379.0,"Crows are fairly smart they can use basic tools. So maybe they have some understanding of the future but don't have a sense of object permanence. 

From Wikipedia on object permanence:

Object permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be perceived (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way). This is a fundamental concept studied in the field of developmental psychology, the subfield of psychology that addresses the development of young children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when the understanding of object permanence emerges in human development."
