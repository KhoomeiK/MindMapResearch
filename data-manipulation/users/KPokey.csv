You will fuck up your knuckles but you will fuck up their *eyes, lips, face and head* and I garuntee they feel that more than you feel your knuckles in that moment.

If you can keep them down, then get on top of them and hit them in the fucking head.

You want to sit on their upper body, not their waist, not their legs. You want to be on their shoulder blades, and wailing on their fucking head. I find you can really lead someone by the arm if you have to get them to the ground.

And listen, if you're losing fucking bite and lock them down, and hopefully you can turn the situation then and there, or disengage for a short second and get another chance.

And last thing, you can't decide you have won. You win if they can't do anything in the immediate moment. If you let them get up afterwards they will take the very next chance to start up again. This is hardest thing to learn, because they will do *something* unless you can prevent it. Which means keeping them down somehow, because say even if you leave immediately and let them up, then they have all the say when they call the fucking cops after a fight *they* started. You need to knock or choke them out, or beat the fucking will out of them even after they say uncle."

But he was gaining on me at that last moment, so I knew exactly what I was going to say when he asked me. I said I had to speed up like that, that he was closing the distance between our cars dangerously fast.

I had to explain as such like two different ways, and he kinda drilled me, like ""Is this car in your name?"" (Yes sir, officer. You can run the plates) ""You do understand why I pulled you over?"" (I said yes. Yes yes yes I completely understood.) ""What *is* the speed limit on this road?"" (Without a beat I told him the correct speed limit)

He kinda just handed me my license back, told me I should only ever be going the speed limit and I completely agreed, over and over. He turned around to leave, and I stopped him to shake his hand, and went home. - Not as cool to me as the time I got out of a ticket because my wallet has a vaultboy on it, but went down about the same. And I always make it a point to shake their hands they love that shit, they eat it up."
