TooAfraidToAsk,ffi72ue,t3_etl02h,1579966807.0,"Sort of related to your question I guess...

What really winds me up today is that people forget the sacrifices American men made during the World Wars, less than 100 years ago American men fought for the freedom of Europe and Asia and yet that’s all forgotten.
They’re spoke of today as fat and dumb and useless but they weren’t spoken of that way when they were liberating towns in Europe.
Look I’m not a big fan of today’s America (I’m English) but the fact that when we needed them they were there still means something to me. 

No I don’t believe England is the greatest country in the world but it’s my country and I love her, I’m sure that’s how many Americans feel.
