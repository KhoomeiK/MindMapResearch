soccer,ff8vg66,t1_ff8qnff,1579697443.0,"I’m biased being Danish, but I thought back then that Eriksen would have been a better fit for Barcelona as well. Coutinho shines as a focal point of the offense, pulling off some really pretty goals and moves in some games. But he wasn’t good enough or consistent enough at doing that, to be the main man at Barcelona - in Coutinho and Eriksens position it’s much more important to make life easier for Messi and Suarez. And it’s my opinion that Eriksen would have done that better."
worldnews,ff8p92s,t1_ff8nh12,1579690073.0,"You’re still not doing it on a large scale, so it’s still very much an issue. The idea is not radical, in fact it should be common sense to implement it. Yet the US is lacking behind in a big way."
movies,ff7bbol,t1_ff5ef3y,1579645400.0,"Well yeah, we can agree that the question and moderation wasn’t exactly excellent. I’m just not sure if it was the right forum for political discussion - at least that’s not why I would watch it. But I get your point."
pcmasterrace,ff5t79f,t1_ff5f2ow,1579609334.0,"Yeah, remember having to wait ten minutes for my old computer to start up.. straight up disaster to make this mistake back then."
movies,ff4gond,t1_ff3wncg,1579563173.0,"I felt like De Niro turning the discussion towards politics was sort of out of place. I mean, the discussion was about who they had been most intimidated by in their career, as far as I remember. So it didn’t really feel like it was an answer to the question they were dealing with."
IdiotsInCars,fekyh2b,t1_fekx6bu,1579210221.0,"If you follow the rules (aka are being easy to predict), and you just assume that everybody else is an idiot, then you’re very much minimizing the risks."
FoodPorn,feksg35,t1_feks0ml,1579206650.0,"It just is. OP even said they used guanciale, so everything points to the sauce being made properly, with eggs and pecorino. There’s just an egg yolk and some chiffonnade on top, doesn’t suddenly make it not a carbonara."
FoodPorn,fekrvx8,t1_fekppzt,1579206324.0,"Come off it. Sure, there’s some herbs and an egg yolk on top, but the dish itself might as well be the best carbonara you’ve ever eaten. It’s a carbonara with a garnish, that’s it. It may not be the classical approach to garnish it, but carbonara is quite clearly still the best way to describe this dish."

clevercomebacks,fehrzup,t1_fehlp2w,1579122709.0,You serious? You sound like all those religious people that say you don’t have a moral compass without god and the Bible. It’s complete rubbish.
todayilearned,fdsomnb,t1_fds65bn,1578705950.0,"Puppies at pet shops is such a weird concept to me. I don’t know if it happens anywhere where I live, but the pet shops I’ve been too have been almost exclusively birds, fish and guinea pigs. Here, if you want a dog, you find a private breeder or you go to a shelter."
Whatcouldgowrong,fdqayre,t1_fdqaszx,1578661608.0,"That’s the same issue you have with automated cars, it’s not stopping them from arriving. 

And yeah, it’s a lot of money to buy new machinery. But the old stuff doesn’t last forever, it has to get upgraded at some point."
Whatcouldgowrong,fdqaokj,t1_fdq8lzr,1578661347.0,"It’s just one private company that has to make a product and sell it. If it’s demonstrably safer, AND they can save on wages, then it becomes an attractive offer."
Whatcouldgowrong,fdqajwj,t1_fdq999k,1578661227.0,"It’s way easier to automate trains than cars, you have got to admit that. If we have cars that can navigate traffic, traffic lights, intersections, all that stuff, without modifying our roads, then it’s pretty obvious that it should be possible to automate a train to work within the current infrastructure. Or at least keep the necessary modifications to a minimum. 

No one is saying that it’s easy, but saying that it won’t happen in any of our lifetimes is silly, considering we have cars that does something more complex right now."
apple,fdijw8a,t1_fdi8orm,1578444554.0,"This was at a time when phone design was a lot more distinct. Today phones are basically screens with as little bezel as possible, so not a whole lot of design to copy. 

It was very obvious back then that Samsung’s phone was an iPhone copy - none of the other competitors had this problem."

soccer,fdiivhz,t1_fdi4jf7,1578443910.0,He was seriously hyped when United first bought him. Just the eternal talent it seems.
tifu,fdiietj,t1_fdi1dnm,1578443614.0,"Well, the person he was answering didn’t say that the guy wouldn’t buy condoms - just that he was really embarrassed doing it. And I think that’s perfectly normal. The mature thing is obviously to just do it anyway, but you can’t fault people for having those feelings. 

For my own part, I totally get feeling embarrassed. Self checkout was a god given in that respect. But I’d still easily endure 10 seconds of awkwardness when I knew what the reward was."
oddlysatisfying,fde534t,t1_fde4uvq,1578331365.0,"Nah, that’s mainly what I mean by get going. One or two to get your aim in."
oddlysatisfying,fddf9vq,t1_fddf2zm,1578309635.0,"Looks most like he’s just making them look neater. Though you’d also do it to trim off unwanted parts, or just making sure that the steaks are all the same size."
oddlysatisfying,fddecfm,t1_fdddysl,1578308344.0,"The larger pieces could be used for something like carpaccio. Or you could grind them up for burgers. 
There is inevitably going to be quite a bit of waste though."
oddlysatisfying,fdd897a,t1_fdcwf7s,1578299301.0,"When you do it a lot, you get pretty precise. I worked for a steakhouse at one point, and once you got going you could be pretty consistently within like 10-15 grams."
todayilearned,fcxork3,t1_fcxgjjf,1578067956.0,"Then you’d just get picked up and driven home by someone else’s car. Problem solved. Or at least, problem moved on to the next person."
todayilearned,fcxojb3,t1_fcxnpr6,1578067809.0,I could see something like a subscription based Uber. It’d remove a lot of the worries with car ownership.
entitledparents,fcxhsbf,t1_fcx0uzh,1578063260.0,And they don’t even make sense. How does niece become L? The other son TK? It’s close to impossible to read.

soccer,fclv2d4,t1_fclizug,1577757169.0,"For overall performance during the last ten years, I’m definitely not hesitant to put Suarez over Neymar. Suarez has been incredible. First guy to beat out Messi and Ronaldo for the golden boot, and he has provided so much more for his teams than goals. Suarez was a huge factor in Liverpool’s attempt at premier league in the 13-14 season. Absolutely the offensive catalyst, and equaled the premier league goal record. Switched to Barcelona, who only really looked fantastic once Suarez got back from his ban and settled in the team - resulting in a very dominant treble season, where he was part of probably the best front three ever seen. And to further the argument, not a season where you would ever consider him less important than Neymar.  

The fact that Suarez has never been top three at ballon d’or is for me another clear indication that it’s a popularity contest for the most part."
soccer,fcltzub,t1_fclq8hx,1577756423.0,"I’m most definitely going to argue that Varane have ever had a higher peak than Pique and Chiellini. Van Dijk is a easier argument to make, if peak is all we’re looking at. But both Pique and Chiellini have been fucking excellent during the last ten years, both when considering peak and overall performance during that period."

YouShouldKnow,fc49avn,t1_fc2uf1i,1577410123.0,"Yeah, for me it says 15 data breaches, and that includes services like imgur, Dropbox and Kickstarter. You basically can’t sign up for anything if you’re too worried about this. Just makes it obvious how important it can be to protect your information otherwise."
fermentation,fc3y2c1,t1_fc0zr1i,1577401584.0,"I have very little experience with fermentation, and just got this book for Christmas. 

From my perspective, it’s a very good read, and very efficient at introducing you to a world of cooking that isn’t very widespread otherwise. It has very much made me interested in fermentation and made me want to experiment with these things. In that respect I think the book does a very good job. I don’t have enough knowledge of the subject to judge it otherwise. 

Do you perhaps have any recommendations for further reading on the subject?"
natureismetal,fc3cfj2,t1_fc32o6s,1577386720.0,"“Would of” is almost exclusively a mistake made by native speakers. It’s written how it’s pronounced, and us with English as a second language usually learn the written form first. 

I really try to not care about grammatical/spelling mistakes, but this particular one is just so incredibly easy to avoid."

apple,fc1at0j,t1_fbydglp,1577313217.0,"You make a compromise that you accept lower quality hardware because the price is lower. It’s not just a term that gets thrown around, it’s a perfectly fitting description of the XR. It’s a good compromise, but it’s a compromise.  

Said in another way, you make a compromise with Apple where they accept a lower price, because you’ve accepted a lower specced phone. It’s literally the definition of a compromise."
oddlysatisfying,fc11db0,t1_fc0knen,1577305463.0,"Well, you probably don’t want to do that with these, since they’re quite sweet. But yeah, principle is the same."
GifRecipes,fbyz2yg,t1_fbydslp,1577230282.0,"Agreed. Whole milk, dark chocolate, a bit of cocoa powder, maybe some sugar and vanilla is really all you need. This looks way over the top for me. 

If you want to booze it up a bit, Baileys or Kahlua isn’t a bad bet either."
GifRecipes,fbyyum7,t1_fbycpt9,1577230095.0,"Using the slow cooker to keep it warm is a good tip, but other than that it’s just a very slow way of doing something that is quick and easy to make otherwise. 

But absolutely not a bad idea to use it as a sort of punch bowl."
television,fbxqynt,t1_fbxky00,1577198054.0,"I’ve only watched the first three episodes, and I think it’s pretty great. Looking forward to the rest of the season if it’s only up from here."
soccer,fbv05st,t1_fbuugaa,1577123218.0,"Not that he flopped, but it’s not really arguable that he didn’t have any impact that game, of course through no fault of his own. 

Then again, I’m also of the opinion that Ronaldo wasn’t Portugal’s best player that tournament overall. Their defense and Pepe in particular played a bigger part."
