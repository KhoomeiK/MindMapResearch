Iteration110Cradle,ff899l6,t1_ff88cog,1579669760.0,That too. But the fact they sent her alone shows how low their opinion of BFE is. Consider she's their top contender for the tournament. If the Akura had sent even an Overlord she could have been killed or maimed before the tournament.
Iteration110Cradle,ff6m9q3,t3_eruu2g,1579630218.0,"I'm more disappointed they provided no protection to their vassal teams. Granted there's only so much they can do if a Herald come's a knocking. Other than sending another Herald. BUT they could have provided defensive constructs of a higher stage to at least buy time. As well as communication devices. The Rising Earth Sect was probably pretty boned. But a defensive construct could have deflected Sophar's attack enough. And it would have provided the Winter Sage's disciples more time for the sage to help them. 

The BFE were honestly lucky they were so low priority that it was only Sophara that showed up."

Iteration110Cradle,feo72ph,t1_fenqqoa,1579295960.0,"Problem is the Soul Cloak is a full body enforcer technique. You'd have to commit some of the channels that would normally be feeding pure to the whole body to providing blackflame. 

I also wonder if you only need to channel from the core to the limb your using. Or if you use as many channels as possible to get more power to the technique."
Iteration110Cradle,fenka7x,t1_fenjpxw,1579286506.0,"With pure madra being compatible with everything, in the sense that it waters everything down, it probably wouldn't result in an explosion. If it was something more volatile or incompatible then perhaps it could explode."
Iteration110Cradle,fenitil,t3_epx63l,1579285612.0,Pure madra dilutes other madras. So Lindon can't mix them as they are. I think forging pure or blackflame works in the sense because they're not actually mixing together. I could see him creating some kind of blackflame bombs that go off on a delay. Problem with that idea is that blackflame still requires a concentrated blast to do serious damage. Someone else suggested the idea of a pure madra bomb/mine that could disrupt people's madra.
Iteration110Cradle,fenhz5a,t1_femdd2v,1579285094.0,"I feel like you'd be working 3 times as hard for a lesser effect. By that I mean it would be mentally taxing. Tapping 2 cores, sending them to separate channels, and then executing two patterns of technique at the same time. And then since you're dividing up your channels, it must take longer to achieve the same result with your techniques."
Iteration110Cradle,fenhf26,t1_femfrwl,1579284747.0,How does that work though? Both the Soul Cloak and the Burning Outer Bathrobe are full body enforcer techniques. Which I would assume requires you to cycle to your whole body. Can't have them both in the same madra channels. It would just create a diluted blackflame thanks to the effects of pure madra.

Iteration110Cradle,fej31fo,t3_epc23e,1579155023.0,I was thinking since he developed a technique for forging blackflame. He should upgrade his shield with blackflame. Perhaps giving it some offensive capability.

I'd be interested to hear more about how it's done."
Iteration110Cradle,fefudgn,t3_enjkqu,1579065493.0,"I think it's easy to forget Lindon has only been practicing the Sacred Arts in earnest for like 3 years. While Yerin was a child prodigy, received training from a sage, then absorbed said sage's remnant. Plus she has a blood shadow. Lindon should be incredibly proud of how far he's come in such a short amount of time. If his trajectory continues he'll inevitably end up surpassing her. 9"
Iteration110Cradle,fef2bqg,t1_feezgc0,1579046515.0,Ah yes. Thanks. Makes me wonder if they'll try to reverse Kelsa's iron advancement to give her a perfect one. Perhaps she doesn't need to advance at all. Perhaps Orthos just needs to have a family to protect to finally reach Underlord. Though it wouldn't really be a good idea in SV. Unless he just plans to help and then leave.
Iteration110Cradle,feevm8v,t1_feerj4x,1579042175.0,They do? I don't remember that.
Iteration110Cradle,feeqwqn,t1_feepnma,1579039304.0,"Not having a perfect iron body doesn't mean you can't advance. It just puts you at a disadvantage. And if you live in the wild or lawless areas it could mean death. But if someone is willing to give you pills, parasite ring, a place with strong aura, and protect you while you cycle. Then it's very much possible to advance. A faction wouldn't do that for someone with an imperfect body. But Orthos or Lindon might for Kelsa."
Iteration110Cradle,fee9otf,t1_fee8zx2,1579029282.0,I assumed that was temporary while he was there. Didn't realize they gave him the deed tot he land and house. :O
Iteration110Cradle,fee4we3,t1_fedzrsu,1579026456.0,I wonder if perhaps the Akura will give Lindon some more resources. Or if they'll consider his improvement on his path as payment enough. After all he got tips from a freaking herald and some guidance from a Sage. Still bringing up some people to truegold probably wouldn't be a huge problem for the Akura. Considering how rich that single valley was in aura and natural treasures.
Iteration110Cradle,fee4p6z,t1_fedyf71,1579026337.0,We're still a long way from Lindon being able to do anything about the dreadgods. And nothing is really set in stone. The story could go in any direction. He'll probably be back in SV if the dreadgod attack is imminent. But I don't see him doing any time soon. Or at least not in the next book. As for Kelsa. Yeah I don't think she will. Though at the same time getting to truegold is all about madra density. Which can be achieved with pills if you're rich enough. I wonder if Lindon is owed any of that metric ton of scales the BFE got for his nomination to the Uncrowned tournament. Or perhaps the Akura would reward him.
Iteration110Cradle,fecrsdt,t1_fe246mr,1578982165.0,"Yeah, it kinda is. :)"
Iteration110Cradle,fecrduh,t3_eoeklv,1578981759.0,"Honestly I don't think he'll be back for a while. I think Orthos and possibly the Jai siblings will rescue Lindon's mom. Then he'll lead them out of there to the BFE. Where hopefully he'll train Kelsa up and eventually reach his own advancement. Possibly the rest of her family. Seriously he could take them all to gold with a few pills and remnants. I wonder if Orthos has scales saved somewhere as payment for his services to the Aurelius family. Also curious if Lindon now being an underlord and possibly a high ranked one. Would he be entitled to anything from the BFE. Especially since he not only made it into the Uncrowned Tournament, but did so as part of the Akura Team. Which has to be a huge boon for the BFE's reputation. Even if he did get knocked out before the top 8. He still got very far for someone from a 'backwater' country."
Iteration110Cradle,fecqtar,t3_eocjka,1578981199.0,Considering the offensive capability at the level he's at now. He probably feels the pressure to have something that can take a hit when he simply can't avoid it. It's not as though he has to sit still and 'turtle' behind it. Though now that he's forged blackflame. Perhaps he can upgrade it using blackflame and even feed blackflame through for defense or offensive.

Except for the bloodshadow that was described as a red belt or rope. Though the top right most is more like what her sword arms are described. Don't think they're meant to be thick.
Iteration110Cradle,fdz8b36,t3_emurzo,1578787634.0,"Considering Yerin is child prodigy trained by a sage, who absorbed said sage. And Lindon is some backwater nerd that's been training for 3ish years. I'm willing to believe that she blocked the damage without taking significant damage."
Iteration110Cradle,fdxitsl,t3_en9wft,1578769138.0,"The Grimnoire Chronicles by Larry Correia. Very underrated trilogy of books. It's one of the first series I started after coming off the Dresden Files. I was looking for more modern magic. But this book takes a different approach. It's set in an alternate 1920s where people have been born increasingly with magic. And they're facing a bit of discrimination. However the main focus of the story is the battle between the Grimnoire Knights and the Imperium of Japan and the most powerful active in the world. Active is what they call people with magic. This fight is centered around retrieving parts of a super weapon developed by Tesla. As in the actual Tesla. There's a whole bunch of alternate history that is part of the world building. Every chapter starts with a quote from a real historical figure, but through the prism of a world with increasingly more actives. 

I'd highly recommend the audiobook version as well. Bronson Pinchot is a wizard at bringing these characters to life. And it's a fairly varied cast of characters. So it's doubly impressive."
Iteration110Cradle,fdxegyq,t1_fdu4gg3,1578767969.0,"That's true. Though honestly it's starting to feel a little annoying that some of his training is summed up as ""Simulated 300 times against them. Won 40%."" It was one of the disappointing points of the book. Was hoping to see the Akura put through Lindon through the paces, but a lot of it got summarized."
Iteration110Cradle,fdtyl3w,t3_en1qh7,1578724377.0,"Everyone else is an elite of one of the world's top factions. They've been getting the best of everything since birth or close to it. Lindon may have received quite a bit from Eithan as far as things go. But he's only been at it for like 3 years? 

By comparison Yerin was a child prodigy in her town. Trained by a sage, whose training was so brutal, she lost multiple limbs in the process. She absorbed the Sword Sage's remnant. And has far more combat experience than Lindon.  

So if anything we should be proud of how close he came. A book ago he was lamenting how much better Yerin was than him. And then he ALMOST beats her. By like a hair! He should be celebrated. He was considered nothing as a sacred artist. He wasn't even allowed to try. In such a short time he broke into a realm reserved for the elite. A true underdog."
Iteration110Cradle,fdtv1n5,t3_emzfex,1578722683.0,"There's one thing that bothers me about their alternate fate. Lindon as an Unsouled wouldn't have been allowed to marry. Now granted he eventually advances to iron in that timeline. But I don't imagine women lining up to be with him anyway. So Jai Chen was really his only option. And he was hers. Since she's in the same boat. In a society that values individual power so highly. They're the only ones for each other in that alternate timeline. 

So I dunno. It's kinda like falling for the only single girl on an island. I won't spoil anything. But I like the path he's taking now. But that's not to say I don't want to see Jai Chen back in the story. There's a lot of cute awkward interactions to be had!"
Iteration110Cradle,fdtqcfn,t3_emwvgy,1578720559.0,In a way it's kinda Will's fault for hyping blackflame so much throughout the books. But I personally didn't have a problem with it. I'm wiling to believe that Yerin could make her attack strong enough to block enough of Lindon's attack. Especially if she used soulfire and he didn't. Honestly she's been practicing her techniques longer than him. She's a prodigy. She absorbed the Sword Sage's remnant for crying out loud! And overall she's got so much more combat experience. People shouldn't be surprised.
Iteration110Cradle,fdtcpsx,t1_fds88vd,1578714893.0,"Oh no, yeah, that's how I found it. And I was amazed by his narration. How he brings all of these characters to life. Him and Travis Baldree are my favorite narrators of all time."
Iteration110Cradle,fdpvfxq,t3_emgl98,1578642125.0,"Please no. It would take away from the dramatic effect of his loss to Yerin. But in any case. If they remove Sha Miara. Why would they put Lindon in? They'd replace her with a member of her own faction the Nine Cloud Court. 

Honestly Lindon is at his best when he's training or figuring things out. So I'm eager to see his interaction with Northstrider. Especially since Northstrider himself seems to like experimentation if Ghostwater is anything to go off"
Iteration110Cradle,fdpv324,t3_emmcia,1578641697.0,"One thing to consider. His madra capacity has a lot to do with the Heaven and Earth Purification Wheel. And another to consider is he's been doing it for like 2 or 3 years? Eithan on the other hand has been doing it for far longer. It's hard to say exactly how long. But I'm betting minimum a decade. The other thing to consider is how people react to Eithan's pure techniques. They're seen as very impractical because of just how much pure madra is needed. So, we can surmise that despite Lindon's cores being impressive, his pure core might not be enough to do many of Eithan's abilities just yet. Which is probably why Eithan is trying to pawn off Lindon's training onto everyone's favorite hobo Monarch Northstrider."
Gundam,fdp659g,t1_fdp0qn6,1578620902.0,Granted a sphere's profile would be the same no matter which direction you attack it. But a Magellan would be better in a head on frontal attack thanks to it's decidedly narrower profile. And its weapon firing arcs were designed with this in mind.

Iteration110Cradle,fdo8pqr,t3_eljnia,1578600827.0,I'd like to recommend The Grimnoire Chronicles by Larry Correia. Very underrated trilogy of books. It's set in an alternate 1920s where people are increasingly born with magic. With that said it's kind of reminiscent of the X-Men with how mutants are discriminated against and become a hot political issue. And while the book touches on that. It's not the focus of the story. It's very much a character driven story. Sticks to the classic formula of the good guys fighting the bad guys. In this case this is the Grimnoire Knights fighting the Imperium of Japan and their powerful Iron Guards. With that said there's no lack of world building and details. One thing they do is every chapter starts with a fictional quote from real historic figures. But done through the lens of a world with magic.
Iteration110Cradle,fdo6nuy,t3_emcm5j,1578599821.0,Honestly he should be freaking proud. Back in Underlord he was lamenting how much better she was than him. This time he came so close to beating her that she had to both use the binding in her weapon and touch the sword icon for the very first time. Considering her start versus his. That's amazing.

But I agree it doesn't convey a message of strength that Lindon saved him. A message of mercy perhaps, a willingness to save others. Which fits more with their human allies. But it doesn't seem 'strong' per se. 

The Gold Dragons killing Nain is ruthless. But there's also things you lose from that kind of behavior. Your underlings start to question their own position and how long before their usefulness is at an end. Your allies question your reliability as an ally. Although Nain being human might take away from that. They could make the excuse they wouldn't do that to a dragon."

So you'd think if it was a time rewind, he wouldn't retain that. So it's still unclear exactly what he's doing.

And to be fair. In the case of the original Uncrowned Tournament there were only two Monarchs left. That left the world vulnerable. So they needed to build up the world's power again. But eventually it's a distant memory and they're more concerned about competing with each other. It became more about showing who's future military potential is stronger.

Although in Jai Long's case, he just needs to make his revelation for Underlord, and some natural treasures.
