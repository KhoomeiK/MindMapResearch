If a guy wanted his balls cut off it would be similar to a hysterectomy. You better believe doctors would give a guy hell before doing that.

Tubal ligation would be the closest thing to a vasectomy."

Tell that to Shavers and Norton.

Boxing,ffpw7y6,t1_ffo3zi5,1580108132.0,"If he doesn't make the fight he is giving up everything. The money, the legacy, the chance to be undisputed... 

If there's a clear declared winner in Fury vs Wilder this time they have the lineal and WBC as well as having clearly put themselves right up there with AJ. Wilder would deserve a 50/50 & if Fury wins it should be a 50/50 for him as well. 

I always thought it was Hearn doing the ducking because AJ is a champion fighter. My take has always been that fighters, especially champions, believe they can beat anyone. After this trash from Joshua I'm now on the fence. I really don't want to believe he's either so scared, so greedy, and/or so ignorant that he would rather take nothing than do a 50/50 for what should be the biggest fight of a generation; but any more talk like this and I'm going to have to re-evaluate my stance."

news,fff8phj,t1_ffeoa89,1579878495.0,"The United States Constitution and laws are particularly vulnerable to organizations declaring themselves a religion. Honestly I'd rather have our laws like they are, and have a few organizations slip through the cracks, then have the government cracking down on every Church when the government doesn't like what they're saying/teaching. Systemic long-term abuse like the Catholic Church did should cause a religious organization to lose their tax-exempt status, at least for a period of time, say 20 years, before they could apply to get it back after showing that they changed how they do things. 

There are good reasons that religious organizations, like many nonprofits, enjoy tax-free status and it's because the things they do benefit society and the general public as a whole without seeking large financial gain for the organization itself. Anytime there's a vacuum of accountability they are going to be evil people to fill it and realize they can get away with horrible things by using religion as a shield. It's up to the government to fill those gaps in ways that don't crush all the good that is being done."

They just get something on them and have them flip for immunity. Don't underestimate the government's ability to hold manufactured charges over someone's head to get them the flip on someone else.
Hell, there might be a celebrity the scientologists like and have been going after for a long time trying to recruit; the government has something on that person gets them to go ahead and go into the organization and gut it from the inside."
