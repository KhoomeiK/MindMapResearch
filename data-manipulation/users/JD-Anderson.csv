MGTOW2,ffe6xlt,t3_et4ncg,1579838329.0,"This is very great advice. I too have saved a lot of money since I ditched the woman.  But I think the peace of mind is the best thing about MGTOW.  The peace of mind of not being into never ending debt of stuff you bought that you don’t even want.  Plus all the other stuff, peace of mind is definitely the best byproduct."
MGTOW2,ffbutcu,t3_esotv7,1579783500.0,"I’d say my family is just as healthy as one’s can be.  The problem is I jumped to marriage with a woman right after school because of societal pressures, NOT pressure from my family.  I had seen one guy who was a family friend get divorced raped when I was a child, but I figured that was just a strange occurrence. Then it happened to me, so I just kinda walked around stunned for a couple years.  During that time, I saw several other men get screwed over.  It just clicked one day that a marriage contract is a foolish one to get in to."

MGTOW2,ff30ytv,t1_ff2umz9,1579530760.0,"Also the fact you’re in your last year of high school, this isn’t the end of your life, just the beginning. I only keep up with one friend from high school, but am super tight with my buds I met in college/work.  You’re about to embark on a change in your life, and you can leave her and her “new friends” behind in a few months.  Just focus on graduating right now, you’ll be fine."
