sleep,ffpz2ae,t3_euewuk,1580111745.0,"I’m an nhs specialist on lower back pain, our general advice is sleep on what you find comfortable and sleep best on. We’ve evolved to sleep on anything and cultures around the world sleep perfectly well on stone, wood, nails, feathers and cotton etc. We in the west have continued way down the soft is better route, but  ultimately some people obviously sleep on soft mattresses their whole lives without issue. 

The length of time spent lying down,  lack of exercise / movement / obesity are associated with back pain, so is repeated movements without rest over time, stress, mental health like anxiety and depression, sleep deprivation, smoking, social isolation / loneliness, unemployment etc

Back pain is incredibly complex, having a good night sleep is essential to improving health, including pain. If a medium or firm mattress works that’s great, but ultimately you can sleep on the floor - as long as you sleep."

brexit,ffoq3zz,t3_eucyad,1580080414.0,"Would love to know myself but I feel it would be really complicated. Business for Britain, (which wants the UK to leave the EU) says more than 60% of UK law is influenced by EU law.

Found a few other bits: According to the House of Commons Library , which itself concedes that there is no completely accurate way to make the calculation, between 1993 and 2014 Parliament passed 945 Acts of which 231 implemented EU obligations of some sort.

It also passed 33,160 Statutory Instruments, 4,283 of which implemented EU obligations.

The impact of EU law varies from sector to sector. In many areas - public order, crime, defence, health - EU laws have minimal impact. But in others - workers' rights, trade - the impact is much greater because the single market and the free movement of workers are at the heart of what the EU is about.

I suspect it will be a gigantic mess of admin paperwork bureaucracy red tape lies trickery Tom foolery hoodwinking under the table spin twisting bamboozling that it will be impossible to really understand the impact and what changes.

So to follow your frog pun, we are indeed about to croak."

Even if your dad had torn ligaments in his knee, for example a torn ACL, the current guidelines for him would be to try and manage it non operatively, at least initially, this because then outcomes are roughly the same and Ligament reconstruction rehabilitation takes about 12-18 months (linger the older you are).
