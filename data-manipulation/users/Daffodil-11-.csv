aww,ffuiphy,t1_fftkbyz,1580242790.0,"You don’t need to catch him at all. The medicine is a paste that you can conceal in meatballs, or other food and leave where he can find and eat it. You only need to do two doses a couple weeks apart. It can really save a mangy fox from an awful decline. It’s harmless to other wildlife but can make collie breed dogs sick — that’s your only caveat.

Edit: here is the product we use. I use about a half a click per dose (about the size of a pea) in a few raw meatballs and then again 14 days later. :)

aww,ffsd06w,t3_eup0dt,1580178765.0,"Serious question. I’m on my phone so it’s hard to tell. He could legit be shedding, having a weird fur day, etc. but is he missing any fur? Bald patches? Seem itchy or thin? If so he could have mange and when caught in time it’s SUPER easy to treat with cheap meds bought on Amazon."
aww,ffjq422,t1_ffjds0e,1580004101.0,Also this is not even Victorian.
aww,ffjq2eu,t3_etw8o0,1580004070.0,People. Holy crap. OP said this photo was taken around 1918. That’s not exactly Victorian era photography. It’s the 20th century. We already had motion picture. The cat is not dead in the photo. Get it together.
