I think a better adaptation to try to avoid hurting people would be to actually require registering of service animals. Not anything super extreme and expensive. Proof of ""prescription"" for the service animal + getting a public Access and behavior test done (even just having an official trainer observe for a trip to Walmart or something) with a qualified trainer and getting them to sign off then having a license for that animal that's exactly like a driver's license all for a very nominal fee. VERY nominal.

My dogs trainer is also a SD trainer (my dog is not an SD, just a reactive asshole that needed to learn manners.

You cannot make yourself sick over your parents marriage.
My dad was hit by a car when I was 7. He's had a tbi ever since. 
For a long time I hated my mom because he spent a few years out, and she considered moving on.  I thought it was cheating, she just couldn't wait for him to be dead, she never loved him. 
 Took me until I had hit adulthood to realize that I was expecting this 32 year old woman to stop existing because of a tragic accident. I spent so much time angry because I lost my dad, I never thought about the fact that she lost her husband.  Even when he eventually did wake up, that wasn't him anymore.

I'm not saying that you can't or shouldn't be angry. The situation sucks. It feels like the whole world just gets up in the morning to shit on you. It makes no sense why this had to happen to him and you hate everyone for it. I GET IT.

And quite frankly I think your mother is clearly feeling the same anger and taking it out on you. In no way is it appropriate to try to isolate you because of this, all that's going to do is make things worse. You need your friends now more than ever.

When I was hospitalized for my BD1 I was labeled as ultradian  rapid cycling because I was cycling ,""multiple times daily"".  I take issue with that assessment but that's another issue for later (I'll explain that issue if you want, I just don't want to big down the comments with it if nobody wants to know lmao). But the doctor claimed that the reason I was so rapid cycling was because if you go off lithium at random each time you run the risk of worsening, becoming more rapid cycling,  as well as becoming more med resistant.  I've found evidence for the med resistance claim but not much on the rapid cycling or worsening part. I think that it may have just been a partial truth scare tactic to keep me med compliant at any and all costs (I had gone off lithium on my own 3 times in about 9 years at that point, but only 1 was non-compliance. The other two were insurance related).

My point in that being, if that is actually the case, there's alot of blame to be put on America's mental health Care system (or lack there of) for the cases that just worsen and worsen.


Actually I changed my mind and I AM going to explain my issue with the ultradian diagnosis mostly because I feel you touched on alot of it in your other comments. 
I genuinely feel as though I was in a mixed state rather than actually cycling. 
This was an under educated, underfunded, and overfilled run down hospital in the deep South that honestly I don't think could properly give the individual attention to each person to go ham on a diagnosis like that.
At the time, I had just gone through a pretty decent amount of traumatic shit all at once, which, kinda fucks with anyone's head.
Every different psychiatrist I've gone to has diagnosed me with either BD1, BPD, or both at once. I think with the potential comorbid BPD it's wholely irresponsible to say it was rapid cycling/ultradian considering what BPD is.
