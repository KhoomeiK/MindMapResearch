If you grew up hearing that abortion is bad, that birth control work at 100% and that only sluts have unprotected sex, it becomes a bit hard to break free of those guidelines. Doubly so if they're instilled in religious environments

Make a simple exercise: we're so proud of ourselves because we're veeeery empathic, right? Then put yourself in the shoes of someone who was raised differently than you, that was taught different things than you, and that didn't get to see and live the same experiences as you."

TwoXChromosomes,ff7k5zb,t1_fez4gpq,1579651470.0,"> In simple terms, anti late term abortions of healthy babies.

Even pro-choicers side with you on that one. 

Some conservative media have done their best to twist, exaggerate or omit information to try to blemish pro choice arguments, for example, they pretend that late term abortions are meant for healthy babies when in reality they're meant for premature babies who have life-incompatible diseases (like being born without brains or with underdeveloped lungs) and who will only ""live"" for minutes or hours in pain, or who are technically brain-dead but their bodies continue to develop. 

Most pro-lifers believe that a woman has no right to have an abortion because life begins at conception. Some don't even care if it was the result of rape, which is where most pro-lifers agree. South of the border it gets worse, catholic old ladies cheered when a 12-year old girl who was raped by her neighbor was forced to continue her pregnancy, and when her baby died (can't remember) they simply said that it was God's will ""but at least the girl wouldn't go to hell for having an abortion"". They also tried to avoid the abortion performed on an 11 year-old girl raped by her own grandfather, and then tried to take legal measures against the doctors who did it. The girl herself had asked her parents to ""take out what her grandpa put inside her"", and she was playing with dolls before the surgery. A 13-year old native girl was forced to have a cesarean, and both her and the baby died. 

Glad to know you're not one of those.  In fact, you sound more like pro choice, given that you agree with setting a limit rather than not allowing them at all.

TwoXChromosomes,ff7f7yr,t3_eqphay,1579648168.0,"A lot of people are being harsh on you, and honestly while they do have a point, it's definitely not the way to say it.

It sucks that you had to go through this situation to realize that everything isn't black and white, but hey, at least you were smart enough to acknowledge the situation and change your stance. Sadly for some people it's harder to understand an opposing point of view than others, some even need to be in their shoes, like yourself. 

This doesn't mean you're a bad person, you simply didn't have the same experiences as the rest of us. Some people get a wake-up call later than others, and we can't be blamed for that. 

I used to be like you in my early teens, I thought that anyone who got pregnant was because they were stupid since there are a lot of birth control methods. You know, the whole pro-life spiel. 

But then I realized that I was speaking from **my** experience, because **I** had received an awesome sexual education at home. As I grew up I talked with friends and realized the SHITTY sex ed they had received, and how they believed in what I call ""folkloric methods"" (i.e. piss or jump after sex) and other outrageous misinformation regarding pregnancy and birth control. Then I got to see up close the effects of unwanted children on a family. I saw the suffering that both mother and children (they were 6!) suffered. By the time I was 20 I had changed my mind and became fully pro choice. 

Don't let these people get to you. You had your reasons to be pro-life, maybe it was taught to you, maybe you saw something horrible that made you hate abortion, maybe you honestly believed that every life is precious and that's a nice sentiment, but now that you've got to be on the other side you were mature enough to change your mind and that's still worthy of admiration."

Make sure to check on the condom after using it. Tie it up and leave it hanging somewhere while you rest, then check it again for possible punctures or leaks.

insaneparents,ff4q6gu,t1_ff4mmlk,1579569785.0,"1: We don't know if OP's mother was married when she got pregnant. If she was, abstinence doesn't really make sense. 

1.  We don't know if OP's mother used birth control or not. They fail, especially if not used properly. Again, given the religious remarks, she likely grew up in a religious household where statistically, sex ed is non-existent or insufficient so her chances of failure are increased. Refer to teen pregnancy rates in the Bible Belt as an example, since unplanned pregnancies among adults are way harder to measure. In fact, we don't even know OP's mother's age, she could have been a teen herself when she got pregnant.  

2. See point 1. Reddit sucks at formatting lists.

3. Yet again, her religious remarks may indicate that having an abortion was not an really an option for her, either because she wanted to have one but wasn't allowed to, or because it does go against her own moral. Her family and/or husband may have forced her into continuing the pregnancy against her will. Hell, she might have tried to have an abortion at home and it didn't work. Or she could simply have found out about her pregnancy past the legal abortion time. 

4. Maybe OP's mother was told that she would be allowed to give OP in adoption, and turned out to be a lie to make her continue the pregnancy and force her to keep OP once he was born. Maybe she did find someone to adopt OP, but the adopting couple changed their mind and was forced to keep the baby instead. Or she was outright denied the chance of giving OP in adoption, either by her parents or her husband.  

5. Please refer to r/regretfulparents and r/confessions to see why this is not a good idea. Or plenty of CPS cases of abuse and neglect. Or OP's post, for fudge's sake. 

6. I'm... quite curious as to how do you give up in adoption an aborted baby, or how do you get around to like motherhood when your child doesn't live with you. 

So I stand by my argument: you don't have a choice if choices are taken from you. All we know is that this is the result of an unwanted motherhood that wasn't managed to be avoided by reasons we don't know of, and therefore we have no reason to judge. And honestly, by the way she talks about raising OP, it sounds like it was a series of awful events that led her there."
insaneparents,ff4gvy6,t1_ff4dgmj,1579563314.0,"Having a risk of something isn't the same as actively choosing to do something.

When you have sex there is a risk of getting pregnant, but that doesn't mean you're actively choosing to get pregnant, and it's even more evident when you're using contraception. 

Also, we have other choices, they're called abortion and adoption. OP's mother seems to have been forced to keep OP and forbidden from picking other choices. If choices are denied to you, then you don't really have a choice."

Also, she sounds pretty sure and dead-set on not wanting to get pregnant. Have you two considered having her tubes tied instead? Though you've probably taken into account that it's a major surgery, it might make her mind easier. It sure did for me, since I had the peace of knowing that my fertility wasn't dependent on someone else. Should something happen to you or your relationship, she still has the peace of mind of still not being able to get pregnant.

I wouldn't suggest having a vasectomy done since you still hold onto the chance of having kids some day. I feel bad for her and I understand where she comes from when asking for this, because the only other choice falls on her with a major surgery and it sucks because she's still having to take yet another one for the team in matter of birth control.

childfree,fe97nij,t1_fe8wo93,1578935069.0,"True. A common argument against overpopulation being real is that it's actually a bad management of resources, and I do believe it's a matter of both. We either downgrade our lifestyle and keep pumping out kids, or we have less kids but keep our lifestyle intact. Childfree folks choose the latter, but the general population doesn't want to choose either of them. 

The problem is that having less kids is far more tangible than any other change in lifestyle, so it hits home harder and people get defensive about it. It's easier for them to try to make OTHERS change before making a change in their own life, especially one so big as one less kid."

childfree,fdobdy6,t1_fdms40b,1578602131.0,"This. My mother is almost 68, she grew in a rural area in Mexico. Her childhood and youth was spent in a green paradise, where you could stretch your arm and pick a fruit hanging over your neighbor's fence. Then she moved to Venezuela, another tropical paradise in the 80s. By then my brother was born, and the world seemed good. But when she moved back to Mexico and to our current city, a brown, tree-less metropolis, she started to realize the truth.

Fast forward to this last decade. Thanks to the internet we're more aware than ever before of every catastrophe and disaster in the world. Forests burning, rivers flooding, hurricanes destroying cities... They're not just a line in the newspaper anymore or a snippet in the news. She can see it in her tv or my phone. 

""If I had known the world was going to be like this, I wouldn't have given birth to you two"" she said one day. ""I got to see rivers and trees, eat natural food and see animals with my own eyes. My granchildren (my brother's children) won't see any of that, at this rate"""

I would say that the world is neither good nor bad, it just is. In some areas we're better than previous eras, and in other areas we're definitely worse. We have technology and human rights, but we also have severe and quick climate change (man-made or not, another topic) and a good quality of life is very expensive. 

Life has always sucked. It does suck a bit less now. It's still not good enough to convince me to bring another human into it, and I acknowledge that it never will."

There was a point not long ago when I saw several CF folks posting about their travels or new stuff and I felt that I **had** to do something similar because I was CF too. 

But no, being CF doesn't automatically mean more money. For some of us being CF means that you're simply NOT spending very much needed money on kids, it means we simply can't afford kids. We have other important stuff to buy or pay, and kids are an obstacle we're avoiding. 

You're not alone. Plenty of CF folks are struggling or simply living but not saving. And that's ok."

Focus on yourself, you'll have some stabilizing to do after a divorce so hang in there while you work things out. Take care of yourself, maybe pick up a new hobby to keep you distracted from the daily routine or pick up an old one that you had to leave before marriage. If things work right, a divorce will feel as a good thing rather than a bad one, consider it a newfound freedom if you will.

Well, we disagree then.

Point granted. But out of two evils, I'd rather not leave children under care of someone who can't grasp the basics of sex ed. If you ask me, any abortion should include a long-term birth control method, that's when I part from ""my body, my choice"". But you can't win everything..."
