Your typo is much better and cuter and I hope no one is giving you too much grief over this giant, furry dong and the man it is attached to."

Why are bees somehow less gross than other bugs? If a giant, wet white larva squirmed out of that leaf-tube I'd puke, but THIS bug is furry so it's fine?"
Catswithjobs,ffcjeq8,t3_est6gn,1579800731.0,This is why unions are important. My industry doesn’t have one and I never get to take naps in a pile of yarn. Say it with me- “workers’ rights/kitties’ rights/same struggle/same fight!”

relationships,ff1ogcn,t3_er4zhb,1579482637.0,"Don't bother her. The least you can do for her is give her the peace of never hearing from you again. I am sure she doesn't care what you're up to and what kind of soul-searching you've been doing. Go on with your life, and use the guilt and concern you feel to motivate your continued self-improvement. 

Did you tell your current girlfriend that you hit your ex? You really ought to; that's something she needs to know."

aww,fe0j3ng,t1_fe0g4nr,1578814191.0,"They're very clean by instinct- a lot of them 'self potty train' and will put themselves back in their cage to shit in the corner of the cage they've designated their bathroom. You can also put a box/tupperware of wood chips in their cage and they'll figure out that's the potty spot. They really do prefer to be clean; I would assume it's because predators find you pretty easily if you leave a trail of crap behind you.

Alternately, I had some rats I believed to be potty trained, until I opened a rarely-used drawer and discovered ripped-up cardboard, tissues, and a thousand rat turds. They made themselves a little public restroom."

Makeup,fdv5csc,t3_emz3ub,1578743367.0,"I fix this by using a green tinted color corrector on my jawline into my neck, and then dusting a light, non-sparkly bronzer all over my face, neck, and decolletage. I'm sure lots of us have faces darker/pinker than our necks. If your skin is darkish/purple tinted, you might want a salmon-colored corrector. I recommend going to a Korean beauty store, such as Pretty&Cute. They have a wide variety of correcting concealers in different weights and shades, at prices lower than you're going to find at Sephora. Don't buy the Sephora Pantone correcting pallet; it is absolute hot garbage. I bought it on deep discount and was still annoyed at how runny and oily the concealer was."

offmychest,fdq23vm,t1_fdq0qhc,1578651090.0,">My questions, fear, and grief were put to rest seeing her resting.

I don't mean to poke on sore spots, so please forgive the possibly offensive question, but this comment made me curious- as a child, seeing the body of your friend made you feel more comfortable about death? I know for sure I couldn't handle seeing a friend dead at that age. I would have felt so confused. Do you feel like an experience with loss at an early age made you better equipped to process grief as an adult?"
AmItheAsshole,fdq158f,t1_fdq0kns,1578649705.0,Jeez. I think I would turn into a serious asshole if people wouldn't hand back my hungry baby. I'm glad these holidays are once a year and you don't have to fight off 'baby rabies' infected relatives on a more frequent basis. Best of luck in this new year; you sound like a loving and devoted parent.
My600lbLife,fdq0sks,t3_em4da3,1578649202.0,"I wish they were actually loving and sweet and supportive of each other. My twin and I love Brandi and Kandi, and root for them like they're people we know and not just reality TV folks! When we saw their original episode, we texted each other to say we couldn't bear it if the other had a medical catastrophe; we'd have been as hysterical as they were!

But these sisters? Fuck 'em. They're not even trying."

I can’t walk past store displays of tiny ugly Christmas sweaters and little baby squeaky toys without wanting to buy something for the not-yet-extant-but-fervently-hoped-for baby. Congrats on your newborn! I hope you got a million cute Christmas pictures of and with the baby."
AmItheAsshole,fdp7dh3,t3_emch4u,1578621720.0,"NTA, at all. You’re taking care of yourself better than most teenagers could.

I don’t know what your desired major is, but it sounds like you’d be a hit in the PNW. Have you looked into Evergreen State in Olympia, WA? It’s, um, outdoorsy to say the least."
AmItheAsshole,fdp58gc,t1_fdop4o0,1578620289.0,"Urghh. The last year I made the fifteen hour drive to spend Christmas with my parents, I made it into the county midnight on Christmas eve, with my hotel being 40 minutes away from their house. Tiny village, no hotels nearby, etc. And my mom demanded I get to the house 8 am on Christmas morning! I said I’d be there at 10 because I needed a good sleep, and she basically said be there at 8 or don’t be there at all and I’d ruin Christmas. Aaaaahhhh. I got there at 9:30 and they’d barely woken up or put coffee on. Oh, my stars. I was irritated and too numbly sleepy to speak. Then my parents repeatedly called my girlfriend by my ex’s name and got into a screamfest about gun control.

Last Christmas, I went to my sister’s house and they had a new puppy. Suck it, parents, I’m doing puppy Christmas from here on out."

I know I haven’t scheduled a cleaning in months, but I’d really just like to have your fingers in my mouth without the pressure of money being exchanged. It makes a descaling feel so... transactional. What do you mean we’re not friends? You sounded so sincere when you asked about my flossing regimen, but I guess that was just an act!’"
