AmItheAsshole,fdga23c,t3_ekxcfb,1578386593.0,"I have naturally JET BLACK and, shit you not, naturally Shirley Temple curly, ringlet, unfrizzy hair. My roommates hate how quickly I’m able to get ready everyday. After the shower, I brush my hair out and-..... that’s it. Takes me a whopping sixty seconds. It takes me longer to brush my teeth. Out of all the things others have told me about my hair, the one I love the most was this elderly lady (80s) who was a loyal customer of mine for years(she was rather picky with her steaks/cuts and I was the only butcher/fishmonger who never minded filling her orders). Out of the blue, she finally asked if my hair was natural. When I told her it was, she grabbed her heart in awe before telling me, “you just don’t see hair like that anymore.” I felt pretty rad for the rest of the week.

Anyways, thanks for giving me a soapbox to brag about my hair. 

OP, I know where you’re coming from but... *sigh*- YTA.

I simply think you’re making a mountain out of a molehill here, furthermore being insensitive of her feelings. Remember, she’s not just trying to look good for herself, she’s trying to look good for you. Try to view the situation from a different angle. Get an idea of her perspective and, without going the defense, let her know yours as well. If you don’t understand changes she’s making to her person, well then, ask her about them! This opens up a platform for you both to find understanding. She can share in reasons of the metamorphosis, you can bring up ideas on finding a different product that’s better, more efficient, maybe even tastes better(joking on the last part), but most importantly- being able to mentally and emotionally reassess and remind each other of your feelings for one another-.. instead of, you know- embarrassing each other in the store.

Gods speed, man."
