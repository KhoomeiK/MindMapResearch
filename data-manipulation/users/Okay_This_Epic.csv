CasualConversation,fey9xzq,t1_fey0ya7,1579442747.0,"Even if it's subtle, it can still be a problem. What I mean is, if your friend messes up, sometimes it's better not to comment on it. ""Did you fall under a lawnmower with that hair?"" ""Damn, you got your fashion tips from Lady GaGa or something?""

These are just examples. Refrain yourself from doing this, and instead compliment them, or help them with it by telling them the faults. It will make you much more likeable, and also a happy person."

CasualConversation,fevp6en,t3_eqq68j,1579399893.0,"The step before self improvement is self acceptance. Accept your flaws, acknowledge they exist. You're already half way there!

You work upon those flaws. Overweight? Diet and gym. You keep putting others down as a joke? Suppress the need; or stop swearing to become a kinder person. (Worked for me!)

No need to sulk upon your current traits; take control of them and change yourself and who you are - be the best you can be."
