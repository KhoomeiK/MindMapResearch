pics,fe27dpz,t1_fdzu25c,1578835244.0,"I *could* defend myself. Let's run through a hypothetical. 

Photorealistic drawing is the antithesis of Western art, which I define as the art that emerged after the collapse of Rome and before Renaissance corruption. It emphasized extension, the distant, the infinite. This can best be seen in landscapes and Gothic cathedrals. 

Photorealistic drawing belongs more properly to Hellenic art, with its emphasis (obsession) on the human form. The Pieta of Michelangelo more has more in common with the artist who rendered the Laocoon than anything in the Western tradition. Look at its incredible detail, the beauty of the human form. Indeed, the Greeks and Romans placed nearly all the emphasis on the human form to the detriment of everything else. 

The drawing that instigated this big stupid mess lacks in artistic merit because it doesn't even strive to have artistic merit. It is a duplicate, a very nice duplicate, of a picture that itself lacks merit. What does it say? What does it express? The arrangement of items on my desk could easily be said to have an equal amount of artistic measure if the original picture was meant to serve as a vehicle for its subsequent duplication. It is a tautology. 

I have much more respect for a canvas adorned with a single color of paint. *That* is a continuation of the Western obsession with the infinite. A single color of paint represents a thing that is infinitely distant, with its details erased by that distance. This finds an analog in the intricate tessellations of the Arabesque or the looseness of the Diwani script. Compare the Diwani to the Thuluth or Kuffic scripts. 

But the fact of the matter is this: art is subjective. I could express an opinion but it would be immediately be eradicated by a counter example, which itself will be eradicated by a third. What then is the point of expressing sincere opinions? Are our opinions worth anything, then? We are not talking about some objective Truth (such as mathematics or God, the latter of the two requiring proof of its existence) against which our opinions can be measured. 

The only meaningful discussion, then, is the meta discussion. Even that fails. At the end of this diatribe I will tell you to suck the corn out of my ass because meta discussion has no meaning either. What value is there in discussing the value of art? That too is subjective. And therefore I choose to be an ass. 

So suck the corn out of my ass."

history,fdrujig,t1_fdrs5og,1578689969.0,"I'd add this. The apparent Soviet disregard for military casualties is a little skewed. Soviet doctrine in the 30s and arguably up to 1943 was almost entirely offensive in nature, with a focus on the so-called deep operations. They also predicted, and accurately, that they would have to replace the *entire standing army* within 8 months. The desperate counterattacks of 1941 were not so much a disregard for life but trying to act within the framework of doctrine.

The European Plain lends itself to kinds of battles where hundreds of thousands of men can be surrounded and defeated, such as First Kiev. Most elements of the German army were not willing to fight to the death. 

Contrast that with Japan. The terrain is very much on the side of the defender, with the exception of the Kanto Plain. The Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa showed us that the Japanese were not going to go down without a bloody, prolonged, and violent fight. The invasion of Japan was expected to produce a million casualties. The US population was already war-weary by 1944."

I myself find something appealing with parts of the Bahai Faith. There are options for me where I live. There is a Bahai center here. But I'll never go. Take from me, if the urge is there then go. If you don't want to commit to being a Bahai or if you can't overcome disbelief, why not adopt parts of the Bahai faith and go to a Unitarian Universalist church? You'd be able to enjoy the social-spiritual elements of religion without being religious *per se*. 

If you need logical arguments for the existence of God, there are plenty out there. Although atheism is the dominant position in modern philosophical thought, it is by no means the only position and there are plenty of theologians and philosophers who have put out solid arguments.
