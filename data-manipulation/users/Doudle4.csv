askgaybros,ffvslgi,t3_ev8eiu,1580272066.0,"I find bi men just as attractive and would treat them the same. I’d also be so flattered if a bi guy was interested in me. I don’t get why other guys would be hesitant in dating them. Like, I feel that bi people are the best at understanding who’s dateable for them cause they’re constantly analyzing that stuff? Idk lol"
askgaybros,ffvqfsl,t3_ev9ejr,1580270399.0,"Right after high school I went to college for comp science and ended up flunking and dropping out. To be honest though, I felt like I just had to go to college because it was expected of me and since I loved playing with computers than why not go for computer science? Well that was a huge mistake, I do love computers but I cannot stand computer programming....

I dropped out, went through a few jobs until I got one as a housekeeper for a hospital. I got a close up look of what nursing is like and really felt like it was something I could do. So I went back to school for nursing and ended up graduating with a 4.0 at age 24.

I’m not saying that computer science isn’t a passion of yours or anything. I really don’t know your story. I just wanna say if you’re unsure about your major or even if you feel like this is too much right now, there is NOTHING wrong with coming back to it later. Don’t sacrifice your mental health because you feel pressured into doing this right now. I went back to school when I was sure and ready and even though it was hard and stressful, I was happy and ready for it. Which is why I think I ended up being so successful.

Anyways, idk if this applies to you or not lol but I feel like young people are so pressured into going straight to college when really education is completely different than the work force. I think getting out a little bit first and having experiences really helps you understand what it is you wanna do."
