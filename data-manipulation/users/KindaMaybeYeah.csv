JusticeServed,ffjewat,t1_ffjc6fr,1579996796.0,"I’m saying she’s an asshole. Taking a shit in front of the store 8 times is very criminal. It’s vindictive and premeditated. She drove to that specific store to shit 8 times. Obviously the store pissed her off, and her way of getting back was to shit in front of it. If she was delusional they would have brought her to a hospital, and not to jail."
IAmA,ffjdrjf,t1_ffi5de8,1579996140.0,"This is the correct answer. I’m bipolar 1 and therapy won’t help get you out of a manic episode. Medication will. Once you’re finally stable, you can see a therapist to help gauge if you’re becoming manic again. They can talk with your psychiatrist and help with early intervention (more powerful meds) if you are starting to have an episode. Also, you can’t take depression medications if you’re bipolar 1 because they can make you go manic, so you can work with a therapist with other problems you’re having like depression or anxiety."
JusticeServed,ffj8zxq,t1_ffitbvc,1579993283.0,"She drives a 2018 Lincoln and someone said she just moved there from California. I doubt she has a serious mental disorder. Just an asshole. Not every asshole has a mental disorder, and not every person with mental illness is an asshole."

suicidebywords,fetq39v,t1_feshk5x,1579378247.0,"I got touched on the arm by a decently good looking woman I was having a good conversation with last week. I instantly fell in love, but then realized I just haven’t been touched by a woman in a long time and I was craving human touch. Kind of sad really."
trees,fepqawk,t1_fepos8d,1579327714.0,"Exercise helps burn fat. The metabolite of THC is stored in the body’s fat. Unfortunately, the more fat you have the longer it takes to pass a test. 

Note, you shouldn’t Exercise and burn a lot of fat before a drug test. It will elevate the THC metabolites if you’ve smoked in the past month and want to pass. All it takes for most average sized people is a month."

trees,fep1ubh,t1_fep1jny,1579310254.0,If you’re fat it can be in your system for multiple months. The skinnier you are the fastest it goes away. This is for urine.
trees,fep1i35,t1_fep14kk,1579310038.0,"Idk, its all over the internet that they test 3 months, something like the newest 2 or 3 inches of hair."
trees,fep0ek1,t1_feorw0x,1579309343.0,"Three months actually.

Edit: this is a hair test and it can look back even further than 3 months depending on how long your hair is. 3 months is the usual."
