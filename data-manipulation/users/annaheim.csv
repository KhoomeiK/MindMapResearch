But it’s due to consoles, and the next generation of consoles coming out within the time window of each other. So rather they do double the work for releasing one for current gen then next gen, they’d just have release for both in one go."
webdev,ff39ubh,t1_ff384aw,1579537062.0,"Hey! Really eloquent reply and thank you very much for the example.  
  
I just visualize the cart example you just gave by doing it in MVC , and I can already tell how tedious it's going to be. There's a lot of fragmentation code wise, and it's making me realize more how components/ui modules do a lot of the heavy lifting.  
  
Thank you!"
webdev,ff354av,t1_ff2yazi,1579533899.0,"Hey! Thanks you and I really appreciate the reply.  
  
I'm not OP, but I recently just completed ReactJS after going through MVC (w/ ejs templating) on this Udemy course I'm taking. And I must say that having an idea how MVC works gave me a pretty good perspective (and good foundational knowledge) how to go through React.  
  
I haven't done any personal projects on either, but my question now is did ReactJS succeeded templating? If not, what critera asks for a project to be done in React, than templating engines?  
  
Thank you in advance"
selfimprovement,ff3462r,t3_erbhwv,1579533225.0,"This is tough, and I can sympathize with you as I've had (and still have some) ingrained stuff with me that was handed down from grandparents/parents' mentality.  
  
But for the most part, breaking the problem down into smaller chunks doesn't work out for this scenario. So I suggest, you go check how deep the water is.  
  
Walk down the shoreline until the water is neck deep, then ask yourself how comfortable are you this deep? Unsettling? Ok, walk back til it's waist deep. Better? Good! Stay here and get comfortable WHILE bearing responsibilites that is good for you and the people around you. Getting easier now? Walk down til the water is chest deep, and ask yourself again. But this time, you bear more responsibilities that is good for you and the people around you. Do this until you can float by yourself in the water (self sustaining).  
  
Now, you're probably thinking, I probably want you to drown adding more responsibility as you go deeper in the water. There is no short answer to this. But the only thing YOU have to remember is the more exposed/comfortable you get with the water level, the more opportunities will open up for you. Eventually, fear will always eat itself out, until there's nothing left."
