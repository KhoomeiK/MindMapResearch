sports,fff80pw,t1_ffepvgn,1579878016.0,"In MMA it's not rare to see only the initial punch or combination that rocks the opponent look like a ""real"" punch as you'd expect. After that there's a lot more seeming flail because they're trying to make contact on a guy who's stumbling, guarding, trying to back away etc.

Obviously there's all kinds of technique behind those follow-up punches still, they're just going to look awkward because the angles are all over the place now."

cosplaygirls,ffcwhja,t1_ffcugky,1579808718.0,It pretty much does with the Witcher.

In all the models I’ve seen Gretzky still wins, but some guys have more goals than he does. Gretzky has more assists than #2 all time has points."
todayilearned,ff4vjc3,t1_ff4ha91,1579573458.0,"Exactly. Reincarnation, not time travel."
todayilearned,ff4v8n4,t1_ff48y2h,1579573252.0,Right. Gretzky's numbers aren't possible today because of how the game has changed. That doesn't mean he still wasn't the best ever. He dominated his peers (who benefited from the easier scoring of the time just as much as he did) to a degree nobody else has come close.

OP didn't mention anything like that, but it's a possibility."
gaming,fdfm67u,t1_fdfloov,1578364913.0,Someone would need a way to stream it to the others. You can do this between friends fairly easily with Discord or Youtube though.
