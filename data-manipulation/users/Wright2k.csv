AskReddit,fdbw212,t3_ekjwpi,1578262773.0,For my 30th birthday my wife threw me a Zelda party. Zelda plates/Napkins/decorations and for my gifts she got me a Master Sword replica and Hylian shield and also convinced my buddy Greg who I’ve games with for years and also lives in PA to drive like 9 hours to TN to see me. She’d never seen me cry but man I bawled like a child that day. Best birthday ever and I’ll never be able to top it for her.

AskReddit,fd6t4og,t3_ek77vu,1578195384.0,I remember it clearly. I was in the basement of my grandparents house playing Halo split screen with my brother when I found out. Such a nice day too till it happened. The phone rang twice. Long enough to break my concentration from the game and when I looked towards it I saw my brother’s eyes. They were shifting from the bottom of the screen to the top rapidly. That little son of a bitch was screen watching the whole time! I thought myself a gentleman but oh how the turntables. We were grounded swiftly after our legendary fist fight and subsequent body slam onto the automan broke a very expensive piece of furniture. War is hell boys.
