It's rolling into the loan, but they tack on an extra $8,000 to your loan just to pocket the extra cash, it seems.

MinecraftOne,femoali,t3_epvasd,1579264545.0,"When you create a portal in the overworld, it will bring you to a place in the nether that is the same coordinates but divided by 8. For example:

Overworld portal coordinates (x, y, z): 64, 64, 88

The corresponding nether portal would be at 8, 8, 11. Basically, traveling 8 blocks in the overworld is equivalent to traveling 1 block in the nether. I could be wrong about the y coordinate but this is definitely true for x and z. 

Now your problem may be happening because your overworld coordinates are not easily divided by 8. You may find better luck moving it to coordinates with a factor of 8, and moving the nether portal to the corresponding coordinates."

TrueOffMyChest,fdhmr7x,t3_elfwpp,1578425941.0,"She is extremely condescending. Worst of all, she does it to you, her own partner. She does not see you as an equal, or her teammate, she sees you as ""just a civilian."" 

I can understand seeking out military people to befriend because they share something in common. But her life revolves around her military career, it doesn't sound like she has a personality outside of it. A good friend of mine served 7 years in the military starting in his early 20's. He wasn't just a guy playing football in the sands of Iraq for that time, he was close and personal with the enemy. He has severe PTSD, like barely stable, heavily medicated. He refers to his service when it's necessary of course... but he has a life and interests outside of his service (which is now his past, where it belongs, like your wife's should). He likes philosophy, he's in my fraternity, he wants to be a writer (not writing about military topics). 

My point is, it sounds like the military was the only thing your wife has done with her life. And to give herself value and justify that, she uses it to belittle other people, including you.

You are right to despise it. She sounds like an asshole."

NoStupidQuestions,fdcoqjq,t1_fdcnpc5,1578280210.0,"Sorry I realized I wasn’t clear with my question after submitting it.

Online, I saw that if the wax hardens and sits long enough untreated, it can somehow cause permanent hearing damage.

Additionally, from my own personal experience: I woke up one night with a horrible, maddening ringing in one ear that has never happened before. After having a doctor clean my ear (as described above with the machine that pounds your ear with water), they removed a tiny piece of wax that was the culprit. It was no more than 1/5 the size of a dime. 

How can that little bit of wax cause all that, but pounding my ear with water causes no damage?"

Swift had only existed for 3 years at that point. Even now, Swift is only about 6 years old.

Kids, assess your interviewer’s knowledge while they assess your own. Competence goes both ways.
