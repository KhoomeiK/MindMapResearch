Occasionally when  I'm hunting with a friend, I'll act all excited over having found something great. Once I have my friend's attention, I pull a Zoom-in out from the back of the pegs and kill the hype."
Whatcouldgowrong,fgh0uph,t1_fggx1lg,1580774020.0,"Same here. Usually, I'm completely unaware of the comment until I reach the punchline. However, I realized partway through that this could be a shittymorph comment or some other novelty story account.

But nope. No HiaC 1998. No jumper cables. Nothing. Just some dudes burning couches."

What most people don't realize that if we aren't familiar with the problem off the top of our head, or if we aren't finding a solution right away, it is almost guaranteed that we're googling the problem. If a problem exists, surely others have experienced it.

It happens all the time when responding to tickets: If the client sees me opening up my phone and googling, they'll sometimes say something like ""well, if you were just gonna Google it, I could've done that myself!""


In which, I'll always want to say ""So then why didn't you do that?""

IT workers aren't know-it-alls. Personally, I hopelessly suck at solving Mac issues because I've never owned a Mac because PCs exist."

facepalm,ffqqj3b,t1_ffqda82,1580141304.0,">The work presented examines life cycle environmental impacts of two 2.0 MW wind turbines. Manufacturing, transport, installation, maintenance, and end of life have been considered for both models and are compared using the ReCiPe 2008 impact assessment method. **In addition, energy payback analysis was conducted based on the cumulative energy demand and the energy produced by the wind turbines over 20 years.** Life cycle assessment revealed that environmental impacts are concentrated in the manufacturing stage, which accounts for 78% of impacts. **The energy payback period for the two turbine models are found to be 5.2 and 6.4 months, respectively.**

Wind *Turbines*, however? Now we're talking."
JustCause,ffgylf6,t3_ethe96,1579918401.0,"I'm excited for JC5. The fact that Project Illapa is gonna be rebuilt means that extreme weather is coming back, which is a gameplay mechanic that I love. Considering that the U.S. is pretty much the tornado capital of the world, it's fairly certain that we'll get to see them again! I hope Avalanche innovates them further."

tall,ff4lk81,t1_fex7phq,1579566548.0,"Agreed with the 'small car' statement. Many cars I've sat in don't offer as much leg space as I'd like.

But a Smart Car? That little car was the most spacious car I've ever sat in! Of course, strangers always get a kick out of the big dude getting in/out of what I imagine is the smallest car on the market, but I honestly love the leg room too much to care."
