I cried like a baby I was so happy. I’ve been a Broncos fan since 1976 and remember all of the Super Bowls in between when we lost.

It was the second best day of my entire life… And I am pretty old. LOL"

All of the guys looked exactly like all of the other ones just different times in their lives. So I know  what you’re talking about.

For those wondering about the 10 children thing. Good Catholic family is all I can say. And my uncle Jack was born in 1918 or 1919. So well before birth control was available.

As for me… My parents refer to me as “rhythm Number three“ and then birth control became available for married women so I am the youngest thank goodness."
