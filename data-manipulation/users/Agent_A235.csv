depression,fe4up84,t3_eno7v3,1578862968.0,"I think the biggest problem with people like that is that they think religion helps the depression itself. A strong relationship with God can help you deal with and persevere through depression, but that is not the same as making it less of a challenge."
depression,fdha2ty,t1_fdh9wyt,1578418639.0,Understood.
depression,fdh8g63,t1_fdh7ryk,1578417653.0,I understand. Sometimes it is easier to tell the internet what you feel then tell yourself.
depression,fdh7qex,t1_fdh7apb,1578417195.0,"I also suggest asking for all grades to be put in, even future assignments (which will be marked as if they were failed). That way, every assignment that you complete will raise your grade, no matter how poorly you did on it. (Sometimes an assignment will actually set back your grade in the moment and may discourage you from completing more assignments."
depression,fdh7apb,t3_ele9fa,1578416926.0,"Early assignments is a start. You are responsibly completing your work ahead of time. If you scheduled a sick day at a job, for surgery or something, odds are you could get some work done preemptively. It is the same with depression but you don't know when the sick day is going to be or how long it will last."
depression,fdh6w1c,t1_fdh6q4q,1578416673.0,It seems that you don't have a consumer base. That is the problem.
depression,fdh6qw2,t3_ele50c,1578416582.0,The best thing that you need right now is restful sleep. Forget the exam. Right now there is no exam. Get to bed and take tomorrow one step at a time.
depression,fdh6ekg,t3_ele1ut,1578416367.0,"Talk it out with us here. It is better for all parties involved if you keep the conversation in the open.

We are here for you!"
depression,fdh67vm,t3_ele372,1578416252.0,"Respectfully, please don't blame others for the problems you have with sales. Maybe you just haven't found the right audience yet. Try to advertise more. 

I dare say that I speak for the majority of the subreddit when I say that you are not helping some of our members by trying to guilt them. I am invested in helping you talk through some stuff, just please don't blame me for the struggles you face."
depression,fdh56l8,t3_eldzth,1578415620.0,You don't need to regret anything. You are taking steps to healing. I am proud of you for that.
depression,fdf5d36,t1_fdf4x8x,1578353681.0,You can get there one day. OP had to work up to it. You can too.
depression,fcoycjr,t3_eiba99,1577844981.0,Happy New Year! Don't give up on us.
Showerthoughts,fcl7c8x,t1_fcl71gy,1577741379.0,"To be clear, there was sexual discrimination for women in education, but not to the degree that scientific progress has been half of its potential."
Showerthoughts,fcl71gy,t3_ehqubu,1577741195.0,"The concept of education for all economic classes did not come about until after the 16th century, pushed for and provided by the Catholic Church. Most wealthy women in the 17th century were educated to some degree. Elizabeth Blackwell was the first female doctor in the US in 1849. A lack of education was (and is) mainly due to economic class and not sex."
ProtectAndServe,f7meyj3,t1_f7ls286,1573861489.0,I downvoted for that reason.
