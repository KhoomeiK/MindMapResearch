There is also a thing about healthy culture where everything is overblown and macros and over exaggerated - random enzymes or vitamins etc.

THAT BEING SAID.

If you can't stand up and sit down or walk for like 10 minutes without panting. You need to make a change. From an animal standpoint, if we had no civilization anymore. Yall going to the after life first.

UnpopularFacts,ff5o3f3,t1_ff3ieaf,1579602697.0,"My guy. The world has turned for the existence of humanity with men and women being men and women. 

Only recently have we had so much convenience on our hands that we have begun looking elsewhere for some sense of worth. 

Can't believe this is conversation. You're a man if you have a penis and you're a woman if you don't. If you've got a biological deformity, be it in your brain or in your nether regions you're an outlier that still has to conform as to being a man or a woman. Be it in East or the West. 

Opinion: 
Men who are biologically born women exist and vice versa. In that case, they should be treated as they have a medical condition. 

Just cause they *feel* like a girl or vice versa doesn't mean shit. The gender construct that society has created defines what a girl does vs what a boy does. Cause you play with dolls doesn't make you a girl. Cause you play with cars doesn't make you a boy. THAT kind of thinking is what should be defeated. We as a society shouldn't be propagating this nonsense and definitely shouldn't be pumping someone full of hormones and cutting off their penis because of it."
