Michigan,ffji255,t3_etpvgo,1579998673.0,I have an old poster that I found a few years back that I believe was put out by one of the lighthouse museums.

I used to work in healthcare and parents lied/exaggerated all the time. I could easily see that combined with the general overworked burnout a lot of healthcare workers experience causing a nurse to make that sort of bad decision.

I think that’s what it’s called, I’m not super tech savvy) so we could play it on a modern laptop. It worked pretty well except for the live action bits being a little glitchy. Until we got to the bacteria checkers puzzle in the lab. It was impossible! We could not figure out how to beat it and neither of us remembered it being that hard. In frustration we ended up googling it and it turns out that the difficulty of that particular puzzle (in a move that was pretty advanced for the time) was based on the speed of your computer’s processor. There’s no point to my story, I just thought that was really interesting/cool."

wholesomememes,fej4nr9,t3_epb9g9,1579156759.0,This pup kind of looks like my lab mix rescue. I’m involved with environmental activist causes and a bunch of my friends found a couple abandoned puppies on their way to a big yearly group meetup and after unsuccessfully trying to find their owner decided to bring them along. They were covered in ticks and had the beginning of mange. At the encampment it’d been raining all week and my tent at the time was kind of terrible so I was keeping my pack in a friend’s car and grabbing clothing as needed. Walking back to camp along the forest service road one day this little black puppy just started following me. At the time I had no idea where he came from but he refused to leave my side. We’ve been inseparable for 7 years now.

blurrypicturesofdogs,fe6p66t,t1_fe6nvl3,1578898996.0,"As mentioned in the other comments, that particular variation seems to be mostly a Reddit thing but the factual aspect of it is basically a visual processing glitch. Cars move a lot faster than humans are supposed to. Our eyes are constantly trying to pick up details and our brains can struggle to keep up which can result in visual fragments or blurs. This combination can give the illusion of something moving or running on the edge of a person’s vision. Anecdotally I’m from a part of Michigan with a lot of backcountry roads through wooded areas and pretty much all my friends have stories of being on one of those roads in their family’s car at night and thinking they see something running or moving from tree to tree."
Makeup,fe6l26v,t3_enr9n8,1578894455.0,"Another general tip that has helped me a lot: ignore trends if they don’t work for you or you can’t seem to do them right. I’ve been going without makeup for a while because the current IG style is not something I’m good at and also just doesn’t really work for my face. I was feeling pretty bummed out about makeup until NYE. I decided to do a ton of research and attempt an authentic non-theatrical mid 1920s look. It turned out so great and reminded me what made me fall in love with makeup in the first place. If what’s currently popular doesn’t work for you, do some digging and borrow from the past."

entertainment,fdya9hx,t1_fdxswux,1578777683.0,Usually the charges for protests are things like “trespassing”. A lot of states have little-used laws on the books that basically mean “disobeying an officer” that they’ll tack on as well. A friend of mine years ago got charged with “failure to step back” which is apparently a legitimate law in Michigan. The judge literally laughed about that one.
entertainment,fdy9g8i,t1_fdxfrys,1578777425.0,"Depends on the protest. Sometimes it’ll happen when cops give orders to disperse and people don’t leave so they just round up everyone in an area. Sometimes they do it without warning. Sometimes they’ll come in with or without warning and just start grabbing people. With large protests it’s become common for cops to practice something called kettling, which is basically when they surround an entire large group in order to perform mass arrests. 

For tamer protests it’s common for them to release people on personal recognizance (that means you don’t have to pay bail, just agree that you’ll come to your court date). A lot of times protest organizers will work with organizations like the ACLU or National Lawyers Guild to make sure they have people in the know beforehand ready to defend the group when they expect arrests. They’ll also set up a bail fund beforehand. The longest I’ve spent in jail after a protest was 11 hours (and the group I was involved with had to put up $2000 bail on each of us arrested) but it’s usually much shorter than that."

relationship_advice,fdtfcgq,t1_fdtd32y,1578715957.0,I think you misread my advice. I am in no way endorsing you hiding it from a partner. What I’m saying is that I think it might be a good idea to slow the relationship down and put off the point when telling him (or anyone) is necessary until you’re out of high school.
relationship_advice,fdtb9ks,t3_en0n23,1578714335.0,"I think you should seriously consider waiting to tell anyone til you’re done with high school. I would worry about him taking it badly, telling people, and the rest of your high school experience being absolute hell because of it. Obviously don’t have sex or get serious with anyone without telling them, but I think it’d be a good idea to wait until you’re out of that insular environment in general."

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdrrr1z,t1_fdr3a7c,1578688770.0,Definitely. The mixing of genres is also a pretty good indicator: the art is obviously movie-style and the text is meant to be a play on the type of salacious text that would sometimes appear on the cover of pulp novels.

safe_food,fdosvjj,t1_fdorfnn,1578612124.0,I usually make mine in huge batches for parties/picnics and kind of wing it but it sounds like the only big difference in our recipes is the amount of booze. I like to still be able to taste the alcohol so I probably use about 1.5-2x as much vodka.
