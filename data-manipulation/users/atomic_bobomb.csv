dogs,ffjgdrw,t3_etz3b3,1579997681.0,Here’s the little bat hanging out with me while I did work. His ears are WAY too big for him. We think he is a golden retriever/shepherd mix. https://i.imgur.com/ri0xkrO.jpg

Edit: the photo is from 7 years ago so it kind of sucks. The Norfolk Inn was a strip joint for a while. I think it has been since turned into affordable housing. https://i.imgur.com/gv4IhU0.jpg

Even then we were denied them because we live in a city. We live in a suburb with three parks within 10 minutes (edit: 10 minutes walking distance). A buttload of churches and schools, a cancer hospital just down the road that is attached to a hospital and a retirement building. This is probably the quietest neighbourhood I have lived in. But, that wasn’t good enough for a <30lbs dog."

I just don’t trust myself with a puppy yet. My sister got a puppy and oh my goodness is she ever cute, but she is a bottle of energy! I wouldn’t know what to do with all that energy."
dogs,fcxjuok,t1_fcxe6ee,1578064709.0,"That is a wonderful way to put it! I think some people have their hearts in the right place with their comments, but maybe have had an accident happen to them or read about an accident in the news. I don’t think Lion has a single mean bone in his body. Even in the video of him playing with another dog you would think he had a human magnet built into him. He kept going to get pets from whoever was closest to him!"
dogs,fcxjb5d,t1_fcwkkfs,1578064335.0,Hahahahahaha! If he will let me put one him on him after he has decompressed and what not then I will take a photo of him with a top hat on otherwise I will just photoshop one on.
dogs,fcxj6fb,t1_fcwgnku,1578064243.0,"Oh, we most definitely did. They spam their dogs all over Kijiji, PetFinder, Facebook, Instagram, but the adoption process is abysmal. I ended up stumbling upon the Bruno Project and that is where Lion is from. With our special needs kitty it was hard to find a dog at the local SPCA or any of the other rescues within a certain radius of us, but I didn’t hear back from some of them (probably due to not having any cat friendly dogs available or because they are overwhelmed). The first rescue I spoke to called me the very next day and then after that it was just as molasses trying to get any information as to what was going on. I am far happier with my experience with the Bruno Project."
dogs,fcww6wm,t1_fcwcadd,1578040189.0,I plan on it! I can’t wait until he is settled into life here. I have so many adventures planned.
dogs,fcw6ver,t1_fcvlyme,1578018512.0,"Thank you for the kind words! I really appreciate them! There was only one name for a brave guy like him. He may not have taken on an entire Persian army with only 300 soldiers, but he did battle his way here! Hopefully his toughest opponent while here is to decide to sleep on the couch, the couch, the bed, or wherever helps he may find himself."
dogs,fcw64cp,t1_fcvumgb,1578018024.0,I will post his first picture there! Thank you!
