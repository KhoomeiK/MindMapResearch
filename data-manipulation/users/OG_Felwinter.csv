That’s more of a plant based diet, though. If you want to be a “vegan” but also want to make exceptions, i would set a goal of how many exceptions you are going to make in a year. Then it’s easier to hold yourself accountable. You might get an upset stomach, though, if the only meat you consume each year is the christmas roast."
