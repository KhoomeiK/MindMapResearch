Games,fffbq60,t1_ffeg295,1579880449.0,"> Then I’d definitely say they should do both;

Easier said than done. ""Just make multiple games, don't make just one game"" is not as easy as pushing export a couple extra times."
news,ffdo2rr,t1_ffd2oih,1579824990.0,"Weird. I'm sure it varies from area to area, but I found Facebook dating to be a complete dud when I was on dating apps a few months ago. I had way better luck as on tinder and hinge myself."
ConanBeingAwesome,ffck3yr,t1_ffcbi5n,1579801155.0,"Yeah, you're like 15 or something?"
todayilearned,ffajhkg,t1_ffahvjz,1579737266.0,But that's not what it says.
todayilearned,ffadx41,t1_ff9tbgb,1579733304.0,"Did you actually read the article? She just messaged him on facebook. You realize the internet allows us to speak to other people in the world.

>“Hello Adem, we don’t know each other but a year ago I met a guy online and that man is using your picture and pretends he is you under another name. I wasn’t sure if getting in touch with you was a good idea but I needed you to know, kind regards, Emma.”"
news,ff6jhmt,t1_ff6hikg,1579628524.0,I don't think you understand what self-made means if you think committing an action to get money is the definition.
news,ff6gpg1,t1_ff6ag3x,1579626821.0,"> I’d argue that embezzling your money is as self-made as earning your money through traditional means

Please argue that point. How could stealing be just as self-made as creating and selling a service or product? 

I'm assuming you steal from your work and are trying to feel better about yourself."
news,ff6blde,t1_ff68zfp,1579623621.0,"Do you have a source on how ""usual"" this is? I have seen it happen before but I am fairly certain it is the exception, not the rule."
Games,feuz8ju,t1_fepfnmd,1579391432.0,"> Bungie designs content like this for the top 1% of players. 

Not only that, but it's just to get people talking. You're absolutely right that they anticipate 99% of players won't even touch it, but they do it because it gets headlines."
relationships,feszk1p,t1_feswuts,1579370472.0,For real. I feel like everyone on here just pull from movie experiences instead of trying to pull from real life experiences.
Games,fekh1nm,t1_fekcsnb,1579199881.0,">Unfortunately it doesn't really, that's kind of the point. It's a passion driven industry.

Saying ""it doesn't really"" is just not true. It's just you making an empty statement. It absolutely doesn't help when you are a top talent looking at prospective companies and one has a reputation for missing deadlines and mistreating employees."
AskReddit,feat3mc,t1_feaff78,1578951966.0,">  I just want to be sure that my attraction or lack thereof exists for the right reasons.

And what are the right reasons? Attraction is attraction. You don't get to reason with or control it sometimes."
videos,fe9npqn,t1_fe92xyi,1578939826.0,"Did you watch the video? What they told her was that it was a sub species. Part of the trick was when he was about to hand the Koala to her, he pointed out fake stuff that made it different from a Koala."
Prematurecelebration,fe95zl4,t1_fe94fd3,1578934638.0,Can you explain what is going on in the image? I can't tell what I'm looking at.
Games,fdqjfh4,t1_fdqi0p2,1578668142.0,"If it's changing your behavior, it's not healthy. You sound like a Pokemon go player trying really hard to justify a mobile game interfering with your life."
speedrun,fdl9i9m,t3_elz3bw,1578519336.0,"I couldn't disagree more. The fun of GDQ is seeing people with a passion for games I haven't heard of playing and describing them. 

Seeing someone beat a famous game I've beaten 5 times is far less interesting."
Prematurecelebration,fdkcmx6,t1_fdjr00r,1578501053.0,Don't think I said otherwise.
Prematurecelebration,fdjai6s,t3_eln9mo,1578463282.0,No she didn't. These things are staged as shit.
videos,fdicz5f,t1_fdhz74b,1578440094.0,That's VR. It's a natural movement. Hard to watch when you're watching someone else's vision.
worldnews,fdi7amk,t1_fdi5f06,1578437001.0,It was an example of why the onus should not be on the reader to prove your information. That's how false information spreads so easily on the internet.
worldnews,fdi488o,t1_fdi359i,1578435444.0,"Yes but you're the one presenting the information. Why not present it once instead of demanding thousands of people to find it over and over again?

It's like writing a research paper for a class and telling your peers to find and prove your information is accurate for themselves."
worldnews,fdi1y11,t1_fdi1gfz,1578434285.0,Spelling a word is a little different from spreading information on the internet.
todayilearned,fdi0zpg,t1_fdh9al5,1578433807.0,"> I'd say it's all the notoriety that has happened.

I mean what else do you think it could be? Her amazing monkey art style? It is clearly the notoriety that raised it's value."
worldnews,fdi0kj8,t1_fdhg7eg,1578433586.0,"> FFS. This sub is full of folks whose only contribution is to ask for a source.

Such is life as an educated person. You question information from strangers on the internet. Why not just link the source in the original comment?"
educationalgifs,fcz2od0,t1_fcxwxx6,1578092440.0,"> I F***ing love science.

You can curse on the internet."
gainit,fcusyfn,t1_fctt6ue,1577987885.0,"There are definitely differences in apple cidar vinegar from vinegars used in sushi such as rice vinegar, but are you guys claiming the vinegar in sushi is unhealthy and should be avoided? Because that's what it seems like you are implying and I don't believe that is true."
netflixwitcher,fc5sxcb,t1_fbilg3i,1577465153.0,">ik this is probably an unpopular opinion but i was moved to tears when ciri and geralt finally met.

Lol do people write ""this is an unpopular opinion"" to get more votes? Do you honestly believe enjoying the climax scene the entire series built up to is an unpopular opinion haha

""I know this is an unpopular opinion but the red wedding was really shocking"""
