Both are trying to survive and avoid the fate they know is likely to come in their own ways yet, when it comes down to it, they face it together respectfully."

 If they would be prepared to facilitate the murder of one of their most popular presenters of the time, I don’t think Louis would have stood much of a chance, nor would ‘they’ have commissioned the program in the first place. 

 Plenty of people had their suspicions and made complaints. None of them turned up dead."

MMA,fetuwec,t1_fetd5na,1579380272.0,"The trouble is 'damage' is hugely subjective and difficult to ascertain unless the recipient visibly recoils/gets knocked down and visible injuries don't necessarily correlate to the power of a punch.  For example, a glancing elbow can open someone right up, a small jab can fuck a person's whole face up if it lands just right etc...

 It's a really terrible metric for scoring and determining who is 'winning' the fight.  And, really, is a haymaker worth any more if it has no greater impact on the flow or balance of the fight than any other?

 Volume has to count for something and a knockdown is its own reward.  So trying to distinguish between punches that are significant enough to be counted is pretty useless."

MMA,fen4b61,t1_felyy3a,1579276663.0,"Both.  Compounded by most of the top 5 leaving for LHW.

  The fact that Weidman, Rockhold and Souza have all left the division and have performed poorly since (with Weidman losing to most of the top 5 while they were still at MW) kind of makes it difficult to choose anyone else for a shot who seemingly actually deserves it.  Not that any of those guys were actually winning fights anyway...

 That's the trouble with a packed division.  A few fighters lose their streaks or have one or two bad fights and you're left with no seemingly worthy contenders."

books,fe6g44t,t1_fe4qlv3,1578889858.0,"For me I think that had more to do with Nicholsen himself than Kubrick.  He just has one of those faces and mannerisms that puts you immediately on edge.  I don’t think there’s a single film he’s ever done in which he’s relatable, sympathetic or even just ‘nice’. 

 His approach to Danny at the start doesn’t really betray anything in the rest of the film. He just comes off as a bit distant. 

 Even so I’m glad Kubrick dropped the more lurid, supernatural parts of the book in favour of the more psychological approach, because monstrous hedges would come off as a bit naff on film.  Until Jack is let out of the freezer it still keeps you guessing."
AskReddit,fe1qkg5,t3_enjev0,1578829676.0,"Obligatory 'not cleanup crew' but did some work on a council property after a person had been deceased in there unknown for a month or so.

 Go in and there's a few guys working there already all too willing to regale the story to me and show me where they had to basically cut him out of the floor (upstairs flat, wooden floor.  Reason they'd been dicovered is because they started leaking in to the property below).

 But the most striking bit was that the floor in rooms that hadn't yet been addressed was literally carpeted with dead flies a couple of mm thick and, being that my area of work was in one of those rooms, got to enjoy the experience of walking over them.  Crunchy."

 Apart from that it’s been a solid runner.

 Certainly they have such a pace advantage over moderate speeds that they would have plenty of time for recuperation while we tried to catch up.

AskReddit,fdh36z3,t1_fdgf19l,1578414398.0," There is absolutely the presumption of innocence in the UK.  It's enshrined in the UK's human rights act. Otherwise what would be the point in going to trial or collecting evidence?

 They're merely letting you know that if you do not mention anything relevant under questioning (after arrest), that will be used by the prosecution to bolster their case.  If you have a simple explanation for it (I was scared, confused, not sure of what to do, wanted to wait for legal counsel etc...) it's a total non issue.

 It's still the prosecution's duty to prove your guilt.  You could remain quiet through the whole process if you wished, even at trial.  Though certain things can be inferred from silence, you can not come to a guilty conclusion through silence alone and if the prosecution doesn't have a good enough case anyway it's totally irrelevant.
