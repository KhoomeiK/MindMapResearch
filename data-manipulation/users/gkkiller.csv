BostonU,femed9k,t3_epnii4,1579251130.0,"Hey! I'm doing a dual degree in journalism and econ (CAS) so this is right up my alley. You should have a slightly easier time of it than me because of the Hub - I had two different sets of gen eds to complete, one from COM and one from CAS, and they didn't have 100% overlap. As for the application process, it's pretty much just a formality as long as you meet the requirements, you just have to get some paperwork signed off on and turn in a statement of purpose. I think junior year fall is the last semester you can enroll in it - just finish it up early though, it's not that hard. 

I strongly encourage you to make a four year plan ahead of time, like, *right now*. List out all the requirements you need to take to finish your gen eds and both your majors, and see if you can make it happen over the course of four years. You might need to take a summer semester or two to finish things up. 

Doing a dual degree often means that you don't have a whole lot of room to mess around and explore, so if you aren't 100% sure about it, I'd suggest you take the time to familiarise yourself with both your majors. Think about your goals for the future and whether or not a dual degree is the best path to go down. If you're not sure, then talk to your advisor when you get to college and some of your professors. Looking up the required qualifications for the kind of jobs you want to have can also give you an idea of what coursework you need to do. If a simple double major can give you the same results, I recommend doing that instead simply because it's less of an effort. That said - I didn't have a career plan for my dual degree going in, but I'm figuring out how to sell the combination of skills I've picked up along the way. As long as you're pragmatic about it, you'll be fine :)"

My honest opinion on your situation rn is to do what you enjoy and excel at it. Put time and effort into the things that you want to pursue *right now*, not 10 years in the future.
