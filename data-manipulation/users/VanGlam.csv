relationship_advice,fepcxhx,t1_fepaefu,1579317444.0,"Bc a real woman/sis would never break sister code,to make herself feel like some kind of hero in order to hush her conscience.  Ugh.  You probably don't have many friends do you?  If you were my sister, I would have distanced myself from you the moment you told Mom or Dad the first time I snuck out of the house or had my first not allowed boyfriend! Geeezues girl! Grow up, and be a woman.  Mind your own damn business.  You seriously can't host a dinner, knowing this? Wow.  Are you jealous of your sis?  Is she the pretty one or something?  More friends than u?  More money? Better job? I just don't understand your way if thinking.  AT ALL!"

relationship_advice,fepaxrr,t3_eq822j,1579316105.0,"This is her journey, NOT YOURS!  LEAVE HER alone and let her experience life.  What benefit will telling serve anyone?  Mind your business! Please! Her journey includes this lesson.  Judge NOT my dear.  If you value your relationship with your sister at all...mind your business.  I am appalled at you for even thinking , that because your sis is not living life on YOUR terms somehow you NEED to step in and, what discipline her? You are not her keeper, you are her sister.  I am so glad you are not my sister.  No wonder she doesn't trust you.  What kind of gold star are you expecting out of you telling everyone? No sister code what so ever...smh."

breastfeedingsupport,fdanej7,t3_ek6acd,1578247969.0,"This is just me...but I am way to territorial to allow another woman to directly nurse my little one.  However, on the flip side, if I was in your situation, and someone close to me needed a wet nurse, I would consider it.  But I think after putting more thought into it...it would just be easier to pump.  Think about it..would you live with this family? A baby requires around the clock feedings.  That is where it could get too demanding. Unless you donate your time at an orphanage, and even then, these days, the way that process works, wet nursing does not seem to be a known method they would actually use."

iphone,fciwjhp,t1_fcioink,1577671519.0,Nice..I just wanted to point out the feature u are referring to.. iCloud photos library stores different than regular iCloud content.  iCloud will not manage device storage for content. iCloud photos library enabled will for photos only.
iphone,fcinoww,t1_fci7hft,1577665656.0,"I just want to add to this a bit..
iCloud is a syncing service...it syncs all contents on your devices, You cannot extend your iPhone storage with iCloud storage.

You have to delete stuff you don't need to make space.

iCloud photo library is indexing your photos, and they are only available to stream.  So this is why they do not take up device storage....but if someone does not know to enable iCloud photo library in their settings, then the photos stored on the device, syncing with iCloud WILL take up device storage.

Other iCloud content is NOT stored the same way and is simply synced with content on your device, meaning if you are syncing 70gb of content with iCloud..(not iCloud photo library or music library) that means, your device needs the same capacity.  Lack of iCloud storage and in turn, lack of device storage for content attempting to sync with iCloud, result in a good percentage of resolvable device issues. (Keep in mind this does not include iCloud photos library or Apple music library, which do the same; indexing the content online off of the device, available for streaming only)

relationship_advice,fc9z5xs,t3_egncd1,1577560389.0,"This is a tough one.  I am the girl that can cuddle a guy friend and it be a form of friendship comfort that does exceed what I would ever do with another female friend.  To respect my significant other, I would avoid doing this when in a commitment relationship.  He should too, especially knowing she likes him.  Be so careful with this situation...I don't have a good feeling about this.  I have been on both ends.  I have been all characters involved in this scenario...so I can confirm anything is possible.  I want to encourage you to set your boundaries pertaining to this situation.  That is your right as a human being.  He has the right, to also tell you, your boundaries, don't line up with his, and vise versa.  So it boils down to, set said boundary...or compromise."
