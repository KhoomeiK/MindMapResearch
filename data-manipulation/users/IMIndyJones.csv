After my divorce, I worked as a server on dinner shifts because it was too difficult to keep a day job. 3 kids guarantees you're going to be missing more work days when you're parenting alone. I paid 2 great sitters $10 hour, and worked a second job when the kids were at their dad's, to pay for the sitters. It sucked a lot because I only saw them for about 2 hours a day."

I don't know what their deal was, but one of my favorite memories is of my mom losing her patience with me and grabbing a spoon; I took off running and she chased me in circles around the house until the absurdity of it hit her, and then she was just laughing as she ran after me. It turned into the both of us running and laughing until we stopped, and she gave me a little smack with it just for good measure."

In my opinion, it's not about either of those things, it's about the stepbrother being an insufferable ass.  While OP is obviously fed up, giving this guy more fuel just creates more drama. He's an idiot, ignore his stupid comments or just chuckle and say ""I'm sorry, I have other obligations."" That's standing your ground, not being walked on.  

I understand the desire to get a good dig in, I have a family member like this, but it's just created a big situation that could've been avoided, especially since OP rarely sees this asshat anyway."

ChoosingBeggars,fevrdkf,t1_fev5d5c,1579400605.0,"Keep in mind also, that kids ask for things for Christmas. When you have no money for gifts, it rips your heart out to know that your child will be disappointed on Christmas morning. 

Most of these charities just give toys based on ""boy/girl"", so while you get gifts, they are  rarely what your child specifically asked for. So while I don't condone selling for cash just for the cash, if someone is trying to sell something to be able to make their child's Christmas, I get it.  

I'll never forget the year my son wanted a Buzz Lightyear talking doll. It was $60 and I had like a $150 for all 3 kids. I still break every time I remember him looking at me on Christmas morning, so confused that Santa didn't bring it. ""Did Santa think I was bad, mom?"" That was 12 years ago.

If I had something I could have sold to get it, I would have."

You can see through the door he's probably on a highway by how fast he's going. He has to focus on the road there. He probably can't see exactly what's going on in the few seconds he probably has to glance.

This is why I pay rent with a money order. It's inconvenient but the peace of mind is worth it.  

I did have to explain to my 30 something landlord, who didn't want to take them that they were, in fact, better than checks because they were guaranteed cash and wouldn't bounce. Also, a few years later, she called me to ask if I still had the funds so she could deposit my money order from 2 months ago that she'd just realized she forgot about.

Messiah,feojxj2,t1_feo4vct,1579301198.0,"Interesting. So far, I've found the reporter to be kind of campy and absurdly stereotypical.  

In regards to the strong female lead, I feel like characters like Eva, Juliana, and Olivia from Fringe, all seem to equate ""strong"" with stoic. Even when they are meant to show emotion, it falls flat. I can't determine whether the writers, or the actresses are to blame for that, but it really makes their characters dry in an otherwise great cast.  

Shows like the Expanse have excellent strong female characters that hold their own, and even outshine the male lead."
