No, **you** are fundamentally misunderstanding what R&D means when they say cantrip. From [the mechanical color pie](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/mechanical-color-pie-2017-2017-06-05), ""All colors get cantrips (spells that draw you a single card)."" (at tertiary for white). 

Now the rest of what you say is about how cantrips are used for *balance*, but any card that draws multiple cards is by *definition* not a cantrip.

So you can't say that a card that draws a card with your opp and then draws another card is a cantrip, and you can't say it's a symetrical draw effect. It's neither of those things. Those two things can not be paired together without destroying their essence, just like a card can't be a cantrip twice.

> But the elegance of this design is that it takes two things white can do. White is dipping into symmetrical draw and any color can get a cantrip. It’s not a break for white if we’re conceding that white is getting “party draw” as you called it. And MaRo has said as much on multiple occasions.

Not only have you ignored my previous argument, but you have never addressed how that is any different from white getting serum vision (scry and cantrip, things that white can do). This card is trying to pair up two things that can not be paired without breaking the color pie, and there's nothing clever or elegant about that.

Draw 2 your opponent draw 2 would already be going further than R&D has been willing to go up until now even with Eldraine (but it will probably happen soon). Draw 2 your opponent draws 1 however is a clear break."
custommagic,fetj2cx,t1_fet0faw,1579375956.0,"But it's no longer symmetrical. Symmetrical draw spells would be if this read draw 1 card and your opponent draw 1 card (as does Happily ever after), or draw 2 card and your opponenty draws 2. A cantrip would be drawing a single card.

If you draw a card and then draw another card, you can't say it's a cantrip attached to a cantrip, this is the same. As soon as you attach draw 1 to something that already draws 1, it's no longer a cantrip. 

Symmetric card drawing should be card disadvantage when only looking at the number of cards drawn overall, else it's not symmetrical. This card is breaking the intent of the experimentation, and is a clear color pie break. This is the same reason serum vision for W would be a color pie break, even if both effects are white."
custommagic,fesrbdx,t1_fesnuem,1579368190.0,"> This card is card advantage neutral, so it’s fair to call it a cantrip, imo.

No. Cantrips have nothing to do with whether a card is card advantage neutral or not. Looting effects are not cantrips, wheel effects are not cantrips, removal are not cantrips, ... From [the mechanical color pie](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/mechanical-color-pie-2017-2017-06-05), *""All colors get cantrips (spells that draw you a single card).""* (at tertiary for white). Also cantrips can be card advantage, like with [[thraben inspector]], as long as they draw a single card.

Specifically here the fact you end up with more cards than you started with makes it not a cantrip. How many cards your opponent draws is irrelevant to whether this is a cantrip or not.

> White has 7 cards in standard with Scry, and literally all of them have scrying as a rider, not a primary effect.

Scry is secondary in white not primary, yes. Card drawing/cantriping however is tertiary.

Hell, look at [[Barrenton Medic]] - it literally puts -1/-1s on itself, prevents damage, and is a Medic in the name!

It's black because it's something black can do, and you yourself think the overall card is more black than white. There are many multicolored cards that get printed that could be monocolored, but aren't.

> for the sake of argument, let's say this card is in a Black-bleeding set, as well

Why for the sake of the argument? If you see a card with energy (or any other set mechanic or keyword), do you say this card is out of the color pie because energy isn't an evergreen mechanic? If you think a card only works in some set, you should assume that card is part of such a set.

In the same vein, fans of experimental books were most able to see things from alternative perspectives, and readers who favored comedy fans were best at relating to others.*""),

For those who want to know why measuring multiple correlations at once is problematic without delving into stats, [here is an xkcd for you](https://xkcd.com/882/).

> I never said that a majority of the playerbase 

To be clear, I was speaking of a majority of Wizards staff, not playerbase, because we tend to see everything through the lense of Mark Rosewater since he writes so much quality content and since he's our main insight of R&D, but he himself says his ideas have been in the minority more than once."

Absurd!

However in case of refusal filiation can be established or broken without such a test being used, using other means (and which party refused the test will influence the judge one way or the other).

Additionally, paternity can't be contested by any party if a child lived with his presumed father for 5 years or more. This is done in order to protect the best interests of the child, which is a principle of french law (following the UNCRC)."
