mildlyinteresting,feeobk8,t3_eorrvu,1579037807.0,It’s not that perfect. Obviously it’s neat but it’s still flawed and doesn’t look like “printing” neat. Just not really interesting.

Minecraft,fe3fsmw,t1_fe3f514,1578848873.0,"I always gave up cause I never understood putting the block back until I learned it’s just making the bottom piston push the top piston up, moving the block. I don’t really count that as using YouTube for help though, because for most people it’s self explanatory, and I came across that info on accident."
trumpet,fdxv0bt,t1_fdxtqop,1578773182.0,90 degrees and a good distance seems to get me the best results and it’s usually what I do. It’s quite frustrating because I play and the tone sounds nice but on the recording it’s rather thin and loud.

Minecraft,fd07jzw,t1_fd0799q,1578114809.0,"Yeah np. I just don’t want other people to deal with the same issue. I had to terraform a custom hill over mine to fix it. It is possible unloading the chunk while on caused this bug, but it’s destined to happen at some point, and I’d rather the contraption just break and be fixable then become completely pointless and an obstruction that you can never remove."
Minecraft,fd07am4,t3_ejs0lc,1578114703.0,I’ve seen this design before but I distinctly remember it being bigger than this and also being made for the PS4 edition.

Minecraft,fd06vhg,t3_ejs1so,1578114524.0,"There’s [this](https://youtu.be/u-pQviEF_Go) one but I wouldn’t recommend it. Mine ended up completely bugging out. The pistons stopped pushing the water logged stairs back and forth and it eventually completely bugged it. It no longer worked and I had indestructible waterlogged staircases in my world that you could walk through but couldn’t break no matter what. I had to terraform a custom hill over it to cover it in my town. I personally use a [bamboo farm](https://youtu.be/l9Jocp83984) design which I modified for sugar cane, but it’s really weird. It relies on luck how many of the sugar cane actually end up working so it may take rebuilding time get good rates. I would build a few but make sure to turn them off before unloading the chunk. Also because of how sugar cane works it doesn’t grow as quickly as the bamboo does in the tutorial but still just as quick as any other design."

Minecraft,fct3y1c,t3_eiruyj,1577932251.0,"Huh? The best mob spawner is a skeleton, but if you want more efficient xp farms, the best ones are guardian farms with a nether side hooked up and gold farms. Both are later game, however, so I would recommend a blaze farm for a really good experience source early game."

Minecraft,fcoyq9t,t1_fcocsq4,1577845290.0,First you have to spawn one that actually breaks the portal block and fight it normally. After that you can spawn as many as you want there and they’ll suffocate.
