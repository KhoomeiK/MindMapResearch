AnimalsBeingDerps,feweaxy,t1_fewccjh,1579409158.0,"Yep! The way I've read is that for the first few *weeks* you literally just stick it over their head, take it off and treat. Repeat that until the cat doesn't seem to care it's around their neck. Then repeat the whole process over again with the buckling (on, buckle, off, treat). Some even advocate only doing one buckle at first and building up to fully buckling them in. Then increase the time your kitty wears the harness indoors until they will walk around like they're not wearing it. Then you add the leash component and let them move around freely with the leash attached until they ignore that too. *Then* outside time begins. 

Your kitty might just need some extra baby steps, but hopefully he can get there!"

AnimalsBeingDerps,few57pp,t1_fevtnuy,1579405573.0,"I've recently bought my cat a harness and we go on ""walks!"" He's always been an indoor cat since he was a kitten but once my other cat passed and we got a dog we took out (sometimes leaving the backdoor open) he started to get curious so we've done leash/harness training. 

I put walks in quotes because walking a cat is pretty much nothing like walking a dog or walking yourself. Sometimes we don't even make it 15 ft into the yard because he wants to smell, sun bathe, roll in dirt, whatever. But he *loves* it, and it's a win-win because he doesn't get to destroy the environment or potentially get run over/in a fight but he still gets that outside time so many cats crave. 

I will also say my cat doesn't give a single fuck about his harness or leash so we had to do almost 0 leash training, which from what I've seen isn't typical for cats. There are tons of videos/blogs that say it can take *months* just to get your cat to tolerate the harness, so YMMV.

Finally, I would have never tried to take my cat who passed away out as she spent a lot of time on the streets as a stray and was terrified of outside. But if you have a cat that seems curious about going outside it can be a great tool."

Part of the problem with condemning/criticizing the US education system as a whole is that there is *no such thing* as a US education system. States/districts (districts typically encompass a city or area) dictate most of education. My education requirements (how many years of english, history, math, science etc. I had to take) were determined by my state. So even though I had to take 3.5 years of history and a government class in high school, someone the state over might only have to take 2 years even though we're both products of the ""U.S. education system.""

I did not ask him to elaborate further so I'm not sure what the jalepeno was supposed to do, or even if it's some kind of trend. Was definitely the first I'd heard of eating a jalepeno a day to keep the doctor away."

I don't think anybody is holding up the UK as the shining example of the wonders adopting the metric system. While the UK hasn't gone entirely metric, plenty of other countries have."

Any money you save in soap you'll lose plus some in the amount of lotion/conditioner you will need.

Even the cheapest shampoo (which you can also use on your body) is going to be gentler on your skin/hair than Dawn."

As a woman who has always had access to trash bins in the stalls, I'd be a little annoyed by the inconvenience but my first thought would never be ""guess I'll just flush it."" I'd do what you do and just exit the stall and discreetly toss it in the main trash. I've certainly been at men's places where there was no bathroom trash and I had to carry it wrapped to the nearest trashcan before.

But I've also known since I started using them not to flush them and apparently a lot of people formed disposal habits before they learned that."
