loseit,fgmyqoq,t3_ezaj8t,1580934499.0,"I agree with the person that says you were doing retail therapy. I definitely commend you for wanting to be more sustainable. Fast fashion and unnecessary purchases are bad for the environment, so kudos to you for stopping no matter the reason. Check out r/makeuprehab if you haven’t already :) I also agree that the deeper issues will start creeping up somewhere else... I hope this isn’t totally out of line but I honestly suggest using the money you used to spend on some therapy/counseling. You have to address the root of the behavior and a professional can really help in that regard, as well as whatever’s making you eat in a way that doesn’t help you meet your goals. If you already go to therapy/counseling feel free to ignore me, and of course I’m not saying you absolutely need it. I think just about everyone on earth could benefit from counseling if they had the option."
