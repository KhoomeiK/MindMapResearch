ContestOfChampions,fcyohat,t3_ejdymf,1578083891.0,I'm honestly surprised that people are having such a hard time with the hall of heros. I found it quite easy for all difficulties
ContestOfChampions,fcyntrz,t3_ejdbm0,1578083530.0,I finished the hall if heros relatively quick. Mainly because I would jump into the next chapter once it was released
ContestOfChampions,fcrg145,t1_fcqhlyr,1577901339.0,"Nope, mysterio's main source of damage is through his poison which is hard to get without  high sigs. So thing is still the better option"

ContestOfChampions,fcoo1jq,t1_fcol4yk,1577837063.0,"If you have red hulk and masacre, then I would say domino is the better option. The flaming trinity is one of the best trinties in the game, and at 5/56, domino will be doing some big damage. It's also super useful for completing varient 2"
ContestOfChampions,fconmh3,t1_fcn0bw1,1577836751.0,"Thing needs his synergy to be able to deal insane damage. If you have champion, hela, angela, and heimdall then you should be good"
ContestOfChampions,fcon7g0,t1_fcnneca,1577836454.0,"Namor is getting rebalanced sometime in 2020, but info on what they're changing should be up sometime in January. So I would hold on to the gem until they announce what they're doing to namor. But as of right now, I would say namor is worth the gem as long as you have a bunch of sig stones, AA benefits from high sig, but it's not needed."
ContestOfChampions,fcomoks,t1_fco5qnk,1577836081.0,"Vision aarkus has some decent damage, its a bug with his kit, so I would say he's not worth r4 until the bug is resolved. Between Fury and Thing, Thing is the better champ unduped, Fury is the better champ when duped."
ContestOfChampions,fco25b2,t3_ehoqv4,1577822690.0,"I kind of conflicted with who I should take up.

Right now, I have a 5* Namor (Sig 91) , Havok, Thing, and Sym Supreme that I can take to rank 4

However, I can also take my 5* quake or cull to rank 5

For more context: 

I'm a decent quake player, she was the champ I primarily used to do an initial run for Varient 2

I haven't completed Varient 2, I haven't attempted Varient 1, and I havent attempted 6.2 (I'm cavalier).

I know about the cull and namor rebalances, I do think namor won't be affected too much, not sure about cull

My current rank 5's are: Blade, Stark Spidey, Ghost, Domino, and Corvus

I would like really like to tackle 6.2 and 6.3, and maybe varient 2 completion 

Thanks in advance!"
