It was in Manhattan, and the street was 16 feet wide. I was in a Century class sleeper with a 53"" and it took two hours and people trying to get down that street were insane with rage. After about an hour the dock master said, ""just follow my hand signals."" That mother fucker caused me to hit the Marquee of a theater across the street with the top front corner of the trailer. He declined to help anymore after that. After I finally got in, the security dude from the theater came over for my info and said it happens all the time. Worst day I ever had in a truck."

You can go to a tech school, and then go to dealer or engine training at Cummins and come walk into a shop with certifications. It would help you get up to a higher paying status or level much quicker than apprenticing. A mentor with no certs will probably make between $13- $18 an hour, and raises will be slow going. You will be relying on someone teaching you while they are trying to make flag time. He's not going to teach you much quickly because he will be telling you what to take off and what to put on, and you willxpick up the processes of jobs and get faster, but the real money is in diagnostics. If you can change a part fast as hell, it doesnt really do you any good if it takes you 3 or 4 hours to come up with a diag you get paid 1 hour to find. Now you might get a good guy who will take his time with you, and actually teach you but its 50/50 from what I've seen. A guy coming into a shop with certifications and no real world experience can make between $18 and $22 to start. After 2 years you can be making $20 to $28 and be very close to making gain time. There are guys who have 5 years experience,  make $30 an hour pulling 100 hour weeks, with 40 hours of actual worked time. That $75 an hour. You wont always make that but it sure feels fucking good when you do. Now if you get in with an oil company or a utilities company after working at a place like this for a few years.

I had this rad ass jungle gym in my yard when I was a  kid. I was probably like 6 years old, and this bitch was legit. It was in the late 80's, maybe 87. You know this bitch was all metal, and sharp corners, and dangerous as fuck right? So we live in a trailer in kansas, so our yard is like 3 feet wide on the back side of the house, and like 12 feet wide in the front. There was a tall pine tree in the yard at the front, it filled the front, I'm pretty sure mom had to cut a path through it to get to the porch. So this dangerous ass swing set is set up in an area, behind the porch that is let's say 12x12 feet long. One hot ass summer morning, I'm out there in the tire swing and I'm fucking flying. I'm jacked up on crystal pepsi, and listening to Guns n Rose's on the tape player. Maybe. Now let's all remember this is the late 80's, my 1 year old sisters car seat is made out of shittier plastic than a major league ballparks souvenir batting helmet, and it has a metal bar across the front. So the tire is plastic as fuck. Hard as fuck. And they modeled it off a tiny ass car cause it had like a 12 inch hole for me to ride to glory in. Anyways, don't you love that feeling when you are swinging and the rope goes slack when you are at the top? Me too, that's why today I'm going for the slack at front and back on every pass. I fly back, thunk, I fly forward, and when the rope catches my weight again, snap. That cheap ass yellow bullshit robe split right open, I was upside down probably 7 feet in the air and I fall straight down, onto the sharp ass, unsanded 2x4s that made the back steps of the porch. I laid there not being able to take a breath for what felt like forever. Yep, thought I killed myself and it wasn't even on a sweet wooden ramp with my bike."
