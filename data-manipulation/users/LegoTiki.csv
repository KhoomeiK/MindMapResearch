facepalm,ffi4byw,t1_ffi2gaj,1579964705.0,"Honestly, I'm sorta believing anything at the minute. I just recently heard about peta taking pets out of homes and euthanising them for that exact reason (I can link you the story but its depressing af) and in my country theres a political party trying to get rid of cars. Like legitimately removing cars from the market. Everyone will have to use public transport, but they've also said they wont put any more money towards public transport. So yeah, I'm sorta believing anything atm"

Idk - I dont know. Self explanatory I think

Wtf - what the fuck. Self explanatory I think

Tldr - too long didn't read. If you typed out something really long and know people wont always read it all, you leave a short version of it at the end

Fyi - for your information. Self explanatory I think

Lmao - laughing my ass off. People dont really mean it like that, it's just a way of quickly saying something is funny

Afaik - as far as I know. Self explanatory I think 

Af - as fuck. Putting emphasis on something

Bf/gf - boyfriend/girlfriend. Self explanatory

SO - significant other. Your partner if you either dont want to say your exact relationship, or if it doesn't matter to the story

Afk - away from keyboard. More for gaming but can basically be used to say you wont reply for a while

Ama - ask me anything. Celebrities or people who've experienced something will do events where people can ask a question and they will answer questions

Bae - before anyone else. Also short for babe or baby. A (slightly annoying) name for your partner.

Hope any of these will help you!"

Isn't everyone with a brain against breeding? Nah I think he means to no longer having pets, and releasing any you love. Fyi, I'm trying to cut out any farmed meat and have never worn leather or fur, as the idea disgusts me. I'm not vegan, but I 100% understand why you would be"
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffi201c,t1_ffhr5gh,1579962720.0,"And now, we move to the backyard bbq of this working class family. The two younglings fight over the nintendo switch, as their mother tries to figure out why her husband no longer finds her attractive. The alpha male, on his part, simply says ""I just wanna grill, for God's sake"". The whole affair is brought to an end when the male brings out his shotgun and fires it into the air, signifying just how much freedom he has. Finally, the patriarch brings his bride to bed, and has the blandest sex imaginable, which ends as soon as he cums"
