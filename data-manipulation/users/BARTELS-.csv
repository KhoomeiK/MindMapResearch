baseball,fdnjg5c,t1_fdn9c3y,1578587082.0,"Attorney here, who is also a former law clerk for a few federal judges. I had a few crazy cases like this when I was clerking in Los Angeles. It's mostly publicity seekers / crazies.

One involved a guy who sued Natalie Portman claiming that she had stolen his script. And I'm not just talking copyright infringement but he literally said that Natalie Portman hacked into his Gmail account and snatched the Word doc. (I think it was for the movie Your Highness, which I didn't see, but looked pretty shitty.) Never mind that Natalie Portman was neither the writer or producer of the movie. The dude represented himself pro se, so I'm guessing he just wanted to try to manufacture an excuse to meet Natalie Portman. (Spoiler alert: She did not attend the hearing where the case was dismissed - to the dismay of the plaintiff and some courthouse staff.)

That year I also worked on one of the lawsuits brought against James Cameron alleging he stole the idea for Avatar. But this dude's was totally baseless, if I recall, based on some shitty book from the late '90s, I think, that didn't seem to have much to do with whatever Avatar was about. The funny thing about the lawsuit was that the guy claimed that he told Billy Zane about the idea at some party in L.A., and that Billy Zane was in Titanic, so of course James Cameron got the idea from Billy Zane. That lawsuit, too, did not prevail.

**Edit**: Adding in one other (sort of) related story. 

When I first moved to LA, I went to the Ralph's at 3rd and La Brea. It was about 10 pm on a Wednesday, and as I'm leaving, I see the most beautiful woman I've ever seen walking into the store. It was ridiculous how hot this lady was, and here she is in some random grocery store. She as wearing this tight little red dress and this crazy fur thing around her neck. And I remember thinking about how different life was in LA, where this was reality and women like this actually existed. And then I realize who she's walking in with: Billy Fucking Zane. Just chill as fuck. Wearing casual clothes. And I swear he nods at me as they walk by. (I'll go to my grave believing he nodded at me.) And that was that."

baseball,fdltnrn,t1_fdlocts,1578532230.0,"Yep, and there are a few thousands players in the minor leagues, so the fact that a few hundred get generally modest signing bonuses one year doesn't move the dial much. 

Plus, most of these guys are spending several years in the minors before even getting the chance at a call up (and most never will get that call). For the sake of argument, that's probably five years on average (minimum), which is a long time to stretch $142,000 pre-tax (and you get slammed with a higher tax bracket the year of your signing bonuses. Over a five-year period, that's maybe $20,000 per year."
