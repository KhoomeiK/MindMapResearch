I'll disagree on the second part. I could see a child (specifically my son in this instance) asking why we don't hit him or if parents hit children or...well, something along those lines, but to actually ask to have pain inflicted? Nah"

Again, only talking about the UK but most of those rules mandate things such as minimum pay and minimum leave/sickness allowance to stop companies taking the piss, they don't have any maximum ones that I'm aware of so there's plenty of scope for employers to go over and above when they feel it's necessary."
