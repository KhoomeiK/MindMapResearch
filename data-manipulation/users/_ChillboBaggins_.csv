The hell are you taking about. First you're talking about using liberal in the American sense, and now you are talking about using libertarian in the classical sense. Liberal and libertarian are synonymous throughout the world but the US. In the US, the colloquial meaning of libertarian is just anarcho capitalist.

Libertarian has a spectrum from left-wing libertarianism like Chomsky to right-wing libertarianism like what most people in the US associate libertarianism with.

Left wing what? Certainly not economic policy. Most of the democratic party is economically liberal, a right wing ideology. AOC just said this yesterday on MLK day. You're showing why it's a useful tool to confuse voters because there are people that will claim to be ""liberal"" because they have some socially liberal policies, but are economically right wing.

No, democratic socialism refers to the methods to implement socialism and that's it. They believe socialism can be implemented by democratic means. There are multiple ways to bring about socialism.

To conflate that they have the same policies is an absolutely ignorant statement. And its nonsensical to double down on it when it is objectively not true whatsoever. They were aligned.

You thought wrong. The ""colloquial"" meaning only applies to Americans and has been misconstrued and obfuscated so any times that it literally only means what you want it to mean. Liberalism is limited government oversight and regulations over economic and social policy. Liberalism is a center right political ideology. Bernie is a self identifying socialist, which is left. Warren is a social Democrat (center left), but seems to have shifted right during this election. 

The substance of what you said is flawed because you have a flawed understanding of what you're talking about. Bernie and Warren are only theoretically aligned by the political ideologies they claim to identify with. Warren is not for medicare 4 all, she is not interested in addressing climate change in a meaningful way, she subscribes to imperialist and hawkish foreign policy, she is self espoused to be ""capitalist to her bones,"" she takes campaign finances from wealthy billionaires and special interests. I would have said they were more aligned prior to her presidential election, but she's shown her priorities throughout this primary election.

Left wing what? Certainly not economic policy. Most of the democratic party is economically liberal, a right wing ideology. AOC just said this yesterday on MLK day. You're showing why it's a useful tool to confuse voters because there are people that will claim to be ""liberal"" because they have some socially liberal policies, but are economically right wing. It's a meaningless term used to obfuscate their political stances to voters.

No, democratic socialism refers to the methods to implement socialism and that's it. They believe socialism can be implemented by democratic means. There are multiple ways to bring about socialism. It is farcical to claim democratic socialism isn't socialism because democratic socialism **is** socialism. All democratic socialism is socialism. Not all socialism is democratic socialism.

We are talking relative to the political spectrum. Not whatever arbitrary relativity you want to apply. Ever since Warren walked back from M4A (she didnt even mention it in the last debate), she has become more in line with center right liberalism. That's why the NYT endorsed **both** Warren and Klobacuher.

>     I don't know how to unpack this statement. They are only theoretically aligned? What does that mean? They literally support 99% of the same policies

Not at all and you just keep showing how ignorant you are of political science and even the policies of Bernie and Warren. I mentioned earlier how they do not have the same policies. To conflate that they have the same policies is an absolutely ignorant statement. And its nonsensical to double down on it when it is objectively not true whatsoever. They were aligned. Then Warren walked back all of her progressive policies. She no longer supports M4A, she toes the same line on climate change as establishment Democrats, she promotes the notary industrial complex, etc.. You refute their significant policy differences, fallicously state that they're 99% the same, and can't even name policies that they are the same on. You have so many misunderstandings of political ideology and politicians' policies that you cant possibly understand what's going on."
politics,ff69yet,t1_ff69ml2,1579622571.0,"See, you have misunderstandings of general political science. To claim Bernie is the most *liberal* senator is farcical. Bernie's personal beliefs and policies are antithetical to liberalism. Even much of Warren's policies contest liberalism. You don't know these political ideologies at all to be determining who is ideological aligned and who isn't.

Edit: The democratic party is not left wing, but has left wing members. Bernie is the only leftwing senator. Warren was left wing because she was a center left social democrat, but she has shifted right for the presidential election, which is frankly a poor strategy if the last some decades aren't evidence enough. Obama shifted right after getting elected and Democrats lost over 1000 seats across Congres and the states. Democrats shifting right has contributed to the lack of American participation in elections."

Likely, this has been done on purpose to confuse voters.

> Economic liberalism, also referred to as liberal capitalism,[1] is an economic system organized on individual lines, meaning that the greatest possible number of economic decisions are made by individuals or households rather than by collective institutions or organizations.[2] It includes a spectrum of different economic policies but its basis is on strong support for a market economy and private property in the means of production. Although economic liberals can also be supportive of government regulation to a certain degree, they tend to oppose government intervention in the free market when it inhibits free trade and open competition. 

Both parties subscribe to this. Obama was this. Clintons are this. All the democratic candidates are this except Bernie. Most elected Democratic congressmen are this minus some left individuals like AOC, Ro Khana, Tlaib, Omar, etc.. All Republican politicians are this. The larger differences between the Democratic and Republican parties are social policies (you may have noticed people refer to themselves as socially liberal), but economically and foreign policy-wise, they have the same agenda because they subscribe to the same political ideology."

SandersForPresident,ff3gxyb,t1_ff291wx,1579540805.0,"You have to take it in the context of corporate media's political scope. Narrow spectrum of debate and acknowledgement, but lively debate in that narrow spectrum. Both republicans and establishment Democrats are economically liberal parties, and their corporate media wings promote that. However, they both obfuscate their economic policies with identity politics. Establishment democrats took the civil rights movement and stripped the labor movement aspect of it entirely, while the republican party traffics in white nationalism. So you have one party that is a diversity capitalism party and the other a white supremacy capitalism party. 

Both of these parties ignore the economic ramifications on americans of the system they promote. So if you're only looking at things from a Democrat, identity politics perspective, then there isn't any reason that white working class people should be doing as poorly as they are, which is the root of the contempt that establishment Democrats seem to hold of them. Taking intersectionality into account, there's no debate that being a woman and/or minority working class person is harder than being a white working class person, but establishment Democrats' identity politics does not acknowledge the flawed system that doesnt work for working class people in their entirety. So for a lot of the white, working class people, they can be drawn to the white nationalist identity politics because at least they don't *feel* like they're being held in contempt (Republican politicians are economically liberal, so inherently hold the working class in contempt too). 

So from the establishment Democrats' perspective of shallow, disingenuous, and hollow identity politics, it makes sense to endorse two female candidates with diametrically opposed policies and ideology."
