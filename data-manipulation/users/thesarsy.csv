Stoicism,ffd9u58,t3_espubb,1579816260.0,"You can tell your friend that she wrote a really good article, it truly resonated with me, thanks for sharing it. A couple of months ago my girlfriend broke up with me, and ever since I've been reading stoicism and self help books, trying to apply their techniques and principles, and they have really been an eye opener for me. I've come to realize how stupid my focus has been, be it having ridiculous expectations or being superficial, and that I should be more aligned with what I need, rather than what I want. Along with my active self development I've also started maturing at a steady pace, becoming more independent and generally more open minded - noticing what really matters to me in my life. I look forward to reading future articles!"
BettermentBookClub,ffd756c,t3_espnt4,1579814728.0,"Develop self-discipline and make space for reading in your day to day routine. Swap binge watching Netflix, playing video games, or similar, with reading for a set amount of time every day. You can go to a place, such as a library, study place, a park or anywhere outside and make that place the place that you come for relaxing and for reading. I've recently stopped playing video games completely and cut down on watching tv series/movie, in order to spend more time on reading books and developing myself and I've never felt better."
Meditation,ffd3a6l,t1_ff8h6e2,1579812573.0,"The Mind Illuminated, a very good read."
Meditation,ff74oe2,t3_es0ru7,1579641056.0,"Very powerful message indeed, thank you for sharing this. I have been confused myself during meditation. Is this the right way to do it? Should I do this in another way? Am I doing something wrong? etc.  
Meditation, to my understanding, is essentially about letting go of yourself, your expectations and surrendering to the meditation. Don't focus on doing it right - if you keep practicing meditation you will eventually find a way that is right for you as an individual. I don't remember who said this, but a book I am reading quoted a meditation teacher saying something along the lines of ""The only good meditation, is the one you did."" which really stuck with me."
BettermentBookClub,ff73vpi,t3_erg6ry,1579640599.0,"Many great tips have already been given. I've started taking a lot of notes on the books that I am currently reading. What struck me, what resonated with me, what could I relate to, what really made sense for me, what should I remember, etc. Having written these valuable notes down, I can now read them and reflect upon them, think about them, tie them together to certain scenarios in life and think about how I can apply them.  
Atomic Habits is a book that I've heard a lot of people mention and it should cover what you're looking for, I am yet to read it myself. I also want to mention that meditation is definitely a big factor and something to try out."
Meditation,ff735to,t3_ers7ye,1579640190.0,"Having practiced meditation daily for the past month, and now trying more mindful meditation than before, it has provided me with a sense of calm, peace of mind and relaxation. It has guided my through my bachelors and is guiding me through my breakup. I've become less anxious and more ambitious. Reading self help and stoicism books together with meditation has also given me benefits of better self esteem and self worth, and has given me a more mature look at people and the world surrouding me, it has altered my opinions and expectations for the better.  
Overall meditation has provided me with balance and a developing mental health."
PlantBasedDiet,ff72kar,t3_es0ay3,1579639844.0,"I usually fry them on the pan first and then make a homemade spicy tomato marinade for them to soak, or create indian inspired curry and use them in those, also having fried them on the pan first.  
I've just started experimenting with creating scrambled tofu and searching for recipes that make use of it."
veganfitness,fel07ix,t3_epgjhm,1579211262.0,"I've always eaten a lot of nuts and sometimes fruits as well in between meals, but what I've done recently that really has helped me is eating a lot of pumpkin seeds and dates, they're delicious and not too expensive."
Meditation,fekzqaa,t3_eppozu,1579210977.0,"I read an article about mindful eating a couple of weeks ago and I've tried it a couple of times since then.  
Make sure that you are alone and nothing is distracting you (electronic devices) and take your time to slowly eat and acknowledge every element of the experience - notice how you feel and what your senses are picking up.  
It's truly a wonderful experience."
PlantBasedDiet,fekxrya,t1_fekx58h,1579209803.0,"This, definitely this. I am not entirely sure what you mean with recommended amount of 2 liters of water though - everybody is different, I personally drink around 3 liters of water a day or 3,5 liters if I have an active day and I am 6'5"" and 187 lbs. There are various websites where you can see how much water you should consume daily."
selfimprovement,fekx8uh,t3_epl2rh,1579209489.0,"I like this way of thinking. I am currently doing my best to become a more mature and independent person, and I agree with you that we are in a way our own parent. I see it like this, it's about doing your best to find a way to solve your problem or whatever is blocking you, rather than asking yourself why you don't already have it or why it's hard to get there - which is ultimately, doing nothing about it or hindering your own progress/development in a way.  
Do not seek the problem, but rather try and solve it."
PlantBasedDiet,fe5aakj,t3_enst9k,1578866994.0,"As humans we fear change, and change usually stops us from taking decisions and risks in life.  
Try starting out by going plant based a couple of days each week. Start researching meals and buy veggies you wouldn't normally eat and build a meal around it. Start making burgers from black beans or mushrooms.  
You mention giving up pasta and white rice will be a challenge. Read about fibre and why we as humans should focus on eating more fibre rich foods, and you'll starting swapping them out for whole grain and also start trying out quinoa.  
As with everything in life, going plant based is a process, keep it up!"
Stoicism,fe58vw7,t1_fe1v87v,1578866627.0,"Very inspiring, I strive to act like this in the future. Good work!"
selfimprovement,fe54dab,t1_fdyfk9s,1578865516.0,"Wow, it's rare to see that something that completely resonates with me on reddit, I could have written your reply! Great to see you changing your diet and meditating, I've been doing the same aswell. I can recommend hitting the gym and starting to read, mainly self help and philosophy books - let me know if you want any recommendations.
Keep up the good work!"
NoFap,fe50hg4,t3_enn5h3,1578864558.0,"What motivates me is the energy and motivation it has given me. I feel more calm during the day and I can lift more in the gym. I have more control over myself, my body and my urges (which are becoming less and less with each day) and I have a more mature and realistic view on women and what sex is about. I'm starting to find porn and the whole idea of it, how sex is viewed in society, etc. as highly repulsive. 
It feels so good to be in control and free from addiction, I can highly recommending meditation as it has greatly helped my self-discipline and me."
BettermentBookClub,fdl41z2,t1_fdk74nn,1578516688.0,"Interesting, I will definitely have to explore the wisdom of Aurelius and Epictetus further.  
While the first half definitely was the best, the second half also contains some very strong points that are definitely worth a read, thank you very much also."
BettermentBookClub,fdl3umn,t1_fdjv8z3,1578516591.0,"I've got a copy of Meditations! I need to finish it. The Enchiridion I've read a bit about, I am trying to get a copy of Discourses and Selected Writings by Epictetus where I believe the Enchiridion is included.  
I will definitely check out Your User's Manual, I've already got the others on my to-read on goodreads, hah!
Thanks for clearing that up about The Nichomachean Ethics! Now the book actually sounds even more interesting, can't wait to read it, thanks!"
BettermentBookClub,fdl3gpg,t1_fdhz736,1578516412.0,"I agree with you, r/stoicism could be so much more!  
I've found this subreddit to be a better resource when it comes to books on stoicism."
Meditation,fdhxbbr,t3_eletkk,1578431848.0,"Suffering has definitely awakened me, it has let me to see things more clearly, and daily meditation is helping me so much. Thank you for this, such an insightful man. RIP."
selfimprovement,fcyood0,t3_ejhi29,1578083998.0,"I feel with you, it sucks and we wish it would never happen to us. My first relationship recently ended and I've felt a lot of physical and emotional pain which I never thought I could endure. My mind has been racing, but I tried staying grounded as I've had a lot of responsibility with my education and career.  
  
What you're telling us, is that it was quite a short relationship. That is good, since you could have spent a longer timer getting more invested in each other. But it sounds like she had some things she has to 'fix' first and she has to do that herself.  
  
Now for you. Reflect on what you have learnt about relationships and about yourself. What was good, what was bad and how can I do better in the future. Start meditating, its really good for you. Keep yourself busy, focus on yourself, do things you like, things that are good for you. Create healthy habits and cut down on bad ones until you can let go of them. In short, become a better you. Hang in there, you're not alone."
NoFap,fcynnn1,t3_ejipo9,1578083436.0,"This is definitely important to remember, not only when it comes to nofap. Also make sure remember where you come from/how bad you've had it. Reflect on how far you've come and live in the present. Practice healthy habits and see people who are good for/to you. In the end, it all comes down to self discipline which gets easier day by day."
veganfitness,fcymu5q,t1_fcx9hni,1578082971.0,"Sounds like a solid meal! I got everything but tofu already, which I plan to pick up tomorrow. Perfect timing as I'll do a long workout tomorrow, thanks for the meal inspiration!"
Stoicism,fcymb7q,t3_ejcijd,1578082656.0,"This is such a good read, I am finishing it myself on sunday and I have taken so many notes on it already. I feel very overwhelmed at how much of it resonates with me and how I can apply a lot of what I've read to my personal life. I simply cannot recommend this book enough - I've already acquired Seneca's On the Shortness of Life which I plan to read in the near future. Seneca is sure to get you hooked on stoicism."
RawVegan,fcylg35,t3_egjww6,1578082183.0,"This is a sign! I just got a slow juicer today (it can juice whole gingers, which I'm super excited about) and read about juicing celery yesterday! As a vegetarian experimenting with raw veganism, this is definitely a motivating post! Do you have any good recipes you can share? Thanks!"
selfimprovement,fcs2dul,t1_fcq9add,1577910421.0,"This right here, I am also trying to focus on not wanting or needing any external validation from anyone, and being better at being transparent and living my true self.    
  
Remember that this is an on-going process of self improvement, and takes time to master.  
Thanks for your reply, I will also check out the other replies you mentioned."
Stoicism,fcrxcl5,t3_eil0da,1577907917.0,"We have all had bad events in our life, and I experienced my worst event out of a sudden just a month ago. At first it was hard to accept and understand, because of the flood of emotions. But now, I am thankful that it happened.  
  
I am thankful, because I have experienced many new emotions and physical pain that I never thought could happen to me. This has taught me so much about life and myself, and has given me a sort of calling that has directed me to living the best version of me. While it is a process to improve, I am taking each day as they come and have already set out many plans and gained new healthy habits over past unhealthy ones which I have eliminated.  
  
I am on a path of becoming a better person and that will reflect in the future, and I can thank my worst experience in life for that. If it wasn't for that, I would possibly still be living a shallow life that wouldn't be true to myself or the people closest to me. I will definitely reflect more on this and elaborate for my personal use, thanks."
Stoicism,fcmyhaa,t3_ei26hr,1577797654.0,"Doesn't get much better than this, a simple but strong message. Thanks for posting this, reminded me that I really need to open up Meditations again."
selfimprovement,fcmxxhf,t1_fcl2c9i,1577797061.0,"This, exactly this! While you shouldn't expect to hear anything from her again, you should never lose hope of it happening. Now its time to focus on yourself and live in the present. Lets go together into a time of good habits and health, both physically and mentally."
selfimprovement,fcl1emw,t3_ehqza6,1577737713.0,"I really feel with you as I am going through something similar. The feeling that you're aware in your life and everything is good, and then it suddenly gets flipped around and your life is changed.  
  
I have also recently gotten a wake up call, perhaps for the better. I can feel my determination and my acceptance and new-found responsibility over my life, dreams and career. It starts with acceptance of what you've done and realize what we have done wrong, then we can start to improve, day by day.  
  
I think its important to remember that you should strive to improve yourself, but not to prove anything to the girl you care about, your friends or family - but for yourself. As much as you care for her and want to do good for her now, after you've had your calling, just respect that not everything is in your control and that fate has gotten you to the place you are now, everything happens for a reason. At least that is what I am trying to tell myself.  
  
Definitely keep growing, learning from your mistakes and improve. That is the only way we humans can become better, by failing. Lets go into 2020 and become a better self and enjoy ourselves more, I am sure the rest will come after."
selfimprovement,fcjlcku,t3_ehdo0p,1577692367.0,"
I'm also currently in a phase of cutting down on social media and instead start living the real life, focus on my career, friends, health, etc. I've started to block media that shows nsfw stuff and display unhealthy habits and replaced them with self development and philosophical influences, be it on reddit, instagram, facebook.  
  
While it is important to realize and stop bad habits, please do not forget to create new ones to replace them. This can be cooking, fitness, seeing friends, reading, developing new skills. Keep yourself busy!"
selfimprovement,fcjktqj,t3_ehccs7,1577691693.0,"I think a lot of people miss the deeper neaning - the reason we should stop is not that video games become boring, the point is how popular games (counter strike, dota, lol, etc) are extremely toxic in many aspects. Players can say really harmful things to eachother, which ruins your mindset and ultimately your day. Next to this, there is also the waste of time. Games doesnt give you any new skills that you can put into pratice. I have truly realized this, stopped playing those games and started actively reading instead. Self help books, philosophy and also some fiction. Or focus more on your career and education. Go to the gym. In short, create healthy habits."
NoFap,fchht78,t3_egzysp,1577650620.0,"I have made mistakes in life and have been punished for them, I have learned my lesson and learned what I did to deserve my punishment, I accept it and want to do everything I can to improve myself and become better. Creating healthy habits such as nofap really feels like I am on the right track to becoming not a new me, but a real and improved me. Thanks for this comprehensive post."

veganfitness,fcfkmrx,t1_fcevqmt,1577630937.0,"I have tried the blueberry/acai which tasted too artificial, I like the maca/caramal and vanilla since they are not too special. I believe the maca/caramel has the benefits of maca which you can read further upon.  
  
Whey, like beef, caused internal pain and stomach ache for me which lead me to research nutrition years ago. Acne also played a factor as I read about whey protein and dairy, although I never had excessive acne, it definitely has cleared my skin."
veganfitness,fc9in71,t1_fc8xjmu,1577553221.0,I can personally recommend Vivo which I've used since ditching whey a year ago. They use a blend of pea and hemp protein and lots of other bodily goods as mentioned.
NoFap,fc9f5xq,t3_egrgj6,1577551770.0,"I am still fairly new and struggling to keep my streak of 29 days going, but every single day is easier than the day before. Keep yourself busy and adopt healthy habbits/hobbies. I quit gaming and started reading philosophy and self development books actively, and review them for my own sake on Goodreads. Focus on your education and career, and make your own meals, every day. Cut off toxic relationships and surround yourself with healthy ones. Keep up the good work!"
NoFap,fc9dtwm,t3_e8ggzy,1577551133.0,"Wow, reading this post and its comments really resonated with me and my current situation. I've already started taking a few steps, but I'm so glad to be on a path to a better and improved me!"
