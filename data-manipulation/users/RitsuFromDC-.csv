TwoXChromosomes,fetd278,t1_fes79uu,1579374069.0,Fair enough. I don’t frequent this subreddit enough to know that trend exists. I still think the title of this thread is unfair and irresponsible
TwoXChromosomes,fes5lqq,t1_fes1puf,1579361654.0,"Ummmmmmmmmmm am I not allowed to remind people about outliers like myself, when I'm incorrectly generalized? Lol. Do you just want an echo chamber in this subreddit?

And I also never commented about how dumb the ladies are for venting about harassment, I commented about how dumb it was to generalize."
TwoXChromosomes,ferysfl,t3_eqbqz9,1579359739.0,"Sorry but this is a really dumb and wrong observation. I strongly dislike getting flirted with from gay guys but also tell my friends to shut the fuck up when we’re at the strip club and they don’t pay the strippers enough respect for my standards.

Just because your guy friends are trash cans doesn’t mean you can generalize"
AskReddit,feobn3e,t3_eq1wzh,1579297771.0,My ideal state includes at least a tint of unhappiness
slashdiablo,feirdte,t3_ep4yhw,1579145291.0,yall have no fuckin imagination lmao
slashdiablo,feh5h6w,t1_feh4ixr,1579109546.0,Haha yeah
slashdiablo,fegqo0j,t1_fegfgyi,1579100264.0,Fair point
slashdiablo,fef0pve,t1_fef0iij,1579045451.0,If javazon can farm naked then why do people buy javazon items Lol haha great point
slashdiablo,fef0cvl,t1_feewz4d,1579045213.0,"Yeah there would be a lot of cow runners, but those runners need certain uniques that don't drop from cows to do their runs effectively. Titan's, silkweaves, lidless, razortail, valk, griffs, facets, random necro items. Where do you plan on farming that without your sorcs? Y'all gonna have ohms with nowhere to spend them.. Hence other farming areas/builds come into play.

The point you made about QOL is really the only valid thing you've said in this thread. Anywho, this has already gotten a negative enough response to never work so whatever. Enjoy your double digit IQ condescending attitude bruh lolz"
slashdiablo,fef037y,t1_feez0ua,1579045039.0,"Why stop there? Because it's the arbitrary stopping point that we chose.

And  yes I'd agree other items would take their place, that's why we just do it for 1 ladder just to try it out for fun"
slashdiablo,feezyq7,t1_feexnmz,1579044956.0,"Lol mr condescending can't read. I suggested just banning sorcs for next ladder, not forever. It would give us ""vanilla"" d2 with a twist, a quick experimental ladder in between the hundred other repetitive ladders we've played.

And reset could maybe be a more than 1 day event, with maybe even some decent pub games going, instead of all private cow/meph runs after reset night."
slashdiablo,feezq8y,t1_feez66j,1579044802.0,"Yes... but we all have to get to lvl 70 without sorcs porting us around... rush bo barbs without sorc to port you through... I ain't saying it's perfect, but it might be worth a try for the 528548th ladder we plan on playing.........."
slashdiablo,feewrap,t1_feeulp9,1579042887.0,Zons and CE necros don't have teleport.
slashdiablo,feewfz1,t1_feetxgr,1579042687.0,"Don't think ""remove everything that is OP"" was suggested. Just a slight change on the overly popular builds to alter the economy.

Banning sorcs would also draw out the most fun part of the ladder (reset)"
slashdiablo,feerluy,t1_feelo7h,1579039720.0,Remove sorcs for a ladder while you're at it and we might actually have a game
AskReddit,fecw6kd,t1_fecpbc8,1578987033.0,I still game that hard at 28. Went through on and off phases where I was “social” and all that. Came back to gaming. No regrets.

Buying food supplies, for example a loaf of bread or package of lunch meat often ends with wasted food because you can't eat it fast enough or get tired of it before you eat it all.
