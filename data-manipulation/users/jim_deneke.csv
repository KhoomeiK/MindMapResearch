todayilearned,ffbvhef,t3_ese28p,1579784136.0,"I'm so confused by the article. Was that journalism or erotic short fiction? 'He drew a hot bath, undressed, and sank into the water.' Btw that dude is hot af."

AskReddit,ff8w96o,t3_es59kl,1579698175.0,That angels were real. My argument that they were real was that I saw them in a movie.
AskReddit,ff5q40z,t3_erocgb,1579605608.0,They get in the way of everything about your face! I've gotten pimples on where the nose pads sit on my face and it has rubbed them so much that they get inflamed and take weeks to heal. The back of my ears have rubbed against the arms of the glasses and caused me to bleed. And fuck smudges.

creepy,fen72ih,t3_epph5n,1579278398.0,I'm not sure how is this NSFW.
Leathercraft,fen6spu,t1_fen4jtr,1579278230.0,Just wet the leather was water (a sponge works) and use a bone folder to get into the grooves. A decent wet mold (on a bigger scale) would involve soaking the leather until no air bubbles rise then letting the leather air out for about 15-20 minutes so the surface is cool to the touch and then you do the molding or tooling.

AskReddit,fek24yd,t3_epj100,1579190992.0,Shadow Warrior 2 was a great game for me to get back into gaming. I usually hate wise cracking Deadpool kind of characters but the character you play is pretty funny.
worldnews,fejz885,t1_fejxd10,1579189195.0,"Usually a full blood test can detect HIV from 18-45 days. Do you mean you did one test in December last year? Have you had a test whilst being with your current partner? I'd do one and have them do one too.  

Undetectable means you've got HIV but because your viral load is under a certain threshold (pretty much the tests are unable to detect it) that you cannot pass the virus to anyone. This diagnosis is associated with people who take their medication consistently."
AskReddit,fejupui,t1_fei8riy,1579186287.0,I really like this one because I feel like there's a sense of clarity in Stevie's realisation of where her life is going and there's a way forward.

Leathercraft,fednl2h,t1_fedixti,1579015856.0,"4-6 seems long and 7-8 seems like a waste, how thick is the leather you're sewing? The length of thread I guesstimate is always 3-4 times the length and the only time I've had to adjust that is because the leather pieces are around 2mm thickness each."
AskReddit,fedj3vm,t1_feccq4z,1579012825.0,I really liked the twist too. It made sense to me but maybe because I do read about communes/cults that try to create an idyllic society.
