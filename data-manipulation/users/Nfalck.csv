politics,fgifl73,t1_fghzl3g,1580820039.0,Has it occurred to anyone that releasing unofficial numbers may be wildly irresponsible at this point in time?
dataisbeautiful,ffyrujo,t1_ffyqv3m,1580353594.0,That's Robert Parish. Vince Carter is just to the left and up (straight below Dirk) at a bit over 1500 games and 25000 points.
buildapc,ffdas9o,t3_et06ek,1579816840.0,"Among my other questions... aside from the joy of building something and the smaller footprint, is there any reason I shouldn't just buy the [PowerSpec G706](https://www.microcenter.com/product/608933/powerspec-g706-gaming-desktop-computer)?"
GreenBayPackers,ffamch5,t1_ffa3418,1579739316.0,"I mean, the roster isn't as good as SF on the defensive side because we haven't been picking in the top 5 for the last few years. But our defensive talent is there. There's no reason they shouldn't perform much better."
todayilearned,fdhri4m,t1_fdgxtqc,1578428755.0,"Well I'm not Colombian, so it seems natural to me that the Americas should be separate continents. But the lack of logical consistency was kind of my point. I guess from a logical standpoint you could try to argue for 6 continents, but if plates are your argument then India and Central America should be separate contintents, and part of Russia is in North America. If it's water, then it also becomes really arbitrary. Why not Greenland? Does a canal (in Panama or Egypt) really justify separating the continents?

Hence, it's cultural and political and not really subject to logical criticisms."
todayilearned,fdguzbc,t1_fdg6rou,1578408987.0,"In Colombia they are taught of 5 continents! You are absolutely right that it's just vernacular, like defining what counts as a vegetable (and not a fruit)."
todayilearned,fdgusy1,t1_fdgf5q7,1578408863.0,"Yeah and for example, in Colombia where my wife is from they are taught there are 5 continents: Europe and Asia are combined into Eurasia, and the Americas are also a single continent. And I realized I couldn't really prove that wrong. It's just coloquial, like the definition of what counts as a vegetable."
cowboys,fdguct9,t1_fde44xa,1578408541.0,"I think that was mostly overblown. But that's two alpha guys sharing a work space and under constant public scrutiny for what, 13 years? No surprise there were disagreements that lead to friction. Aaron is a stubborn guy. But none of that ever really appeared in public sniping. Nothing like what the Vikings had at the start of this year, for example."
cowboys,fdgu4lh,t1_fde8bee,1578408377.0,"Yeah and to be fair it sounds like he got a lot out of his sabbatical year, so maybe he comes back with a lot of new ideas and practices. He's a smart guy no doubt."
cowboys,fde2a9u,t1_fde08f0,1578329569.0,He had a very bad social teams coach for awhile. Honestly seemed not super important to him. I think his expectation was just for special teams not to fuck up.
cowboys,fddtpwo,t1_fddsl6g,1578323735.0,"Packers fan. McCarthy won't scheme guys open and create wins out of nothing, but he is great at letting super talented guys succeed. You should have no drama and a cohesive team, and a very good QB coach. Unless Jerry steps on it..."
nba,fbfq65o,t1_fbfnf7g,1576817353.0,He's shooting 41% in December though on like 5 attempts a night. Getting there...
