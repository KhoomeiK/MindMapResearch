Imagine a system with no bail bondsmen.  People just sit in jail til their trial or they plead out.  No one is forcing anyone to use bail bondsmen.  And if criminals decide to skip court, the bondsmen find the criminal vs trying up government resources, since they are financially at risk for them skipping court.
