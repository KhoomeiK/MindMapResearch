They have legal prostitution and legalized drugs. Those things are also carefully regulated by the government. They have spent lots of money on bicycle infrastructure, and many people that commute by bicycle (far more than any US city). The current mayor of the city (a woman) is a member of the green party. And yes, that kind of green party. The politically liberal and environmentally conscious kind. The party was formed by the merger of four left-wing parties: the Communist Party of the Netherlands, the Pacifist Socialist Party, the Political Party of Radicals and the Evangelical People's Party. But clearly you know more than I do about politics in Amsterdam. Please enlighten me on how the communist and socialist parties in Amsterdam are actually not liberal.
