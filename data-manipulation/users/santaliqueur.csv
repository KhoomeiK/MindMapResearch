> As for people throwing stuff out the window, that's awful and those people suck. We should absolutely try and fine them, but the primary costs of a deposit will fall on people who pay the deposit and then use curbside recycling.

Fine them? Are you being serious? During all the millions of times people throw trash out the window, how often is this done in the direct view of a police officer that sees the act and decides to issue a ticket? 

Please think about what you are saying. Issuing a fine **sounds nice**, but do you REALLY think it will accomplish anything? It is entirely unrealistic to hope fines take care of the problem of people throwing trash out their window. It is universally done when there are no other people around. Almost nobody would ever be fined.

Making the trash itself valuable will give thousands of people *incentive* to pick up the trash. The threat of fines will not incentivize anyone to stop throwing trash out their window. The death penalty does not discourage some people from killing. Fines will not stop anyone.

> I guess the question is: how many people use curbside recycling and what percent of nips are simply thrown on the ground vs recycled?

My question for you is: Why do you think one system is enough to cover all our trash needs? Simply because it **could** if we were living in a fantasy world? 

I still don't see why someone would be against adding deposits to pieces of trash littering our neighborhoods. I already asked this and you didn't tell me why you are against it, you just say curbside recycling should be able to do it so why doesn't everyone use it? You are answering different questions than I'm asking.

> Moreover, why stop at nips?

Now you're speaking my language! :)

> Should we add deposits to larger liquor bottles, cigarette butts, and chip bags?

In my opinion, we should add a deposit to any small disposable item that is easily redeemable by the state, with minimal overhead to the state. Liquor bottles would be relatively easy, chip bags not so much. I don't claim adding deposits to things will solve all our problems, but if a piece of trash is suddenly worth 5¢ as deemed by the state, those piece of trash will suddenly disappear from our neighborhoods.

Cigarette butts are another issue altogether. Not only do I not understand how we allow drug companies to sell their drug sticks that kill 1,300 people PER DAY in this country, but we somehow don't force their waste to be biodegradable. We'd rather talk about how vaping is causing lung disorders in teens. Forget about the 55 people who die every hour because of these drug companies I guess. At least let's force their waste to take care of itself.

Curbside recycling is wonderful for those people who will use it. You need to understand this leaves a significant amount of waste from people who will never use it, and that's the category of waste being discussed."
