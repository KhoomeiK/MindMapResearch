AskWomen,ffbi9nj,t3_esod02,1579766548.0,"I've been fairly lucky in most things gyn related.  Fairly lucky.  Three incidents stand out - two were related.

1. Started BC in college, I think I was around 20-21.  They told me to expect breakthrough bleeding.  Ok, cool.  No big deal.  They didn't tell me to expect bleeding so heavy I was going through a heavy duty pad every thirty minutes and -still- making a mess.  Came to a head one night at the movies when blood was literally pouring down my legs.  I had to ask for a small stack of towels in the ER, just so I could sit down.  The female doc went in for the pelvic exam and spent the next thirty minutes telling me I was going to get breast cancer because I was fat.  Literally.  She stated ""You're going to develop breast cancer because you're fat.""

2 & 3.  I find it funny now, actually, but apparently I have an ovary that likes to hide.  Two separate internal ultrasounds.  I swear on everything unholy that both male doctors were jamming that stick around like they were in a WWII airplane dog fight.  They were holding that damned stick VERTICAL at points.  I was >< to telling both of them that they weren't going to find the ""B"" button to hit.  It's an ultrasound wand, not a joystick."

tifu,ff8eway,t3_es489q,1579675529.0,"Shot in the dark here, and perhaps just a slightly different perspective - but do you know if she's had a full physical, mentioning these changes?  Even mentioning it to your own general practitioner might be able to give you some new ideas / avenues.  If it came on suddenly, there may be a root cause that got missed somewhere.  Not everything will show up in the pregnancy physicals.

Otherwise, it sounds like it may be time to extricate you and your kids.  Is the alienation of affection reasoning for divorce still around?  It sounds like you love your kids immensely - something to keep in mind is what kind of relationship you and your wife are modeling for your kids.  Will they grow up thinking that lack of physical contact with a spouse is normal / healthy?  Does she show emotion / affection with the kids?

Good luck with all this.  You deserve better - so do your kids."
AskWomen,ff5oig0,t3_erqfef,1579603323.0,"Opening night for year 11 / junior class play. Picture it: Empty stage, save for me in an ass ugly blue polyester/spandex dress, monologuing to the audience. Castmate is supposed to come up behind me, clamp a hand over my mouth, and walk/drag me backward through a door.

Castmate was nervous. And over enthusiastic.

Next thing I knew, I was flat on my back, dress up around my ears (completely), both legs straight in the air doing a v-for-victory. Needless to say, I ended up crawling / being drag-crawled off stage, while the audience roared. The show had to be stopped for almost ten minutes while the audience settled down.

Theres the diet, the exercise, consults with nutritionists, research, consults with a therapist / counselor, as needed. But the weight isnt coming off. Youre miserable from having weight be your life. Theres no enjoyment in food anymore. So you make the choice to fall off the wagon. Its only a little, at first. But then, one day, you just say fuck it. Six months later you just so happen to see a new specialist about an unrelated issue and he says wait a sec.  These two meds youve been on for the last five years are contraindicated for weight loss.

What youre describing is a lot like a good therapeutic relationship. No one knows the inside of your mind better than you do. People sometimes think therapists have all the answers. They dont. What they do have is training in how to listen and how to help their clients reframe their thinking. They also have tons of outside resources that can also help. Your therapist just hasnt gotten that degree yet. :)

In a slightly different way of viewing it, I dare say most others who do this call it praying. Theyre talking to someone with no corporeal form, just like you.

AskReddit,fe4cpwm,t3_ennslu,1578857925.0,"Become comfortable advocating for yourself. A big part of this is educating yourself, mainly in the areas of medical issues and the workplace. Know your rights and dont be afraid to respectfully speak up. If a medical professional isnt listening to you, speak up. Dont put up with it. (BTW, listening is very different from giving you the answer you want - learn the difference.) Find successful people you work with, whose integrity seems to align with yours, and be aware of how they work, how they handle things. Know that, no matter how great the Human Resources staff are, employees usually arent their top priority in disputes with the business. Their job is to protect the business.

Get rid of the idea that someone has the right to demand respect from you because theyre older / richer / prettier. They dont. They have to earn it. Do your job, but remember that elders arent infallible solely because of their age.

It costs nothing to greet people in the workplace with a smile and a nod or some form of appropriate acknowledgement. Capitalize on one-on-one unexpected time you have with higher ups. If you see your three-levels up boss at the printer, alone, take a second to greet them - but dont use it as a bitch session. Ask about them, dont make it about you.

Say thank you, and mean it. 

Dont live to work, work to live. Make a good impression, but maintain a good balance."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwwb9g,t1_fdwmvax,1578762914.0,"One thing to consider - she currently SEEMS healthy enough to do those high intensity performances even at over 300 lbs. In heels (that's the part that amazes me *grin* the heels).

And yeah, there are dozens of things that could be going on with her body medically. PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), for example, is a bitch. It makes losing weight twice as hard, simply because of the way a woman's body chemistry works. Thyroid issues are another cause. Medications for issues unrelated to weight are a little-talked about issue. When you put all that together with the culture of judgement and shame, it can feel kind of like a Herculean task to lose weight. And for the lucky ones, balance is the key. They learn what works for them. It may be 100% healthy meals 99% of the time and 2 hours of working out a day, it could be cutting carbs, it could be telling the food police to step off. 
For some of us, particularly those born in the 70s and 80s, the hate and judgement is deeply ingrained. That was our culture. For those of us with certain cultural backgrounds, there was the added complication of food = love. There was incredible comfort in cooking with the family and celebrations revolved around food. Our childhoods were characterized by being told to eat and eat everything on the plate, then being shamed for it. I love that current generations are actually talking about disordered relationships with food and finding healthier alternatives. It beats the hell out of the days when the rest of the family was having meatloaf and all the fixings, except for the too thin or too far kid who was isolated with a different meal.

Of course, these are all just stream of consciousness thoughts. The tl;dr is basically that there are a metric ton of factors that influence health and weight and I prefer coming at things from a place of loving support.

BTW, thanks for calling me on the first comment - and thanks for the responses."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwlfsx,t1_fdwjm4c,1578759870.0,"Completely agree!  The only thing I'd add to that - even if Lizzo is unhealthy at 300 pounds, that may not mean she's living an unhealthy lifestyle.  Is it likely?  Possibly.  She could be exercising 4 hours a day and living on McD's, for all we know.  We just can't say for sure that she's living an unhealthy lifestyle.  She could be dealing with a major health issue.
And I LOVE discourse / dialog."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdvx67t,t1_fduxtt9,1578752718.0,"This is what I get for redditing right before bed. In many ways, youre right. With Lizzo, the point I meant to get to was that, in my experience, people look at a fat person and make the assumption theyre unhealthy or have an unhealthy lifestyle. Or, conversely, they look at a thin person and assume they have a healthy lifestyle. Both assumptions may be wrong. I also didnt intend to bash science and medicine. The research is sound - people above or below a certain defined set of characteristics are statistically more or less likely to be unhealthy. But those statistics and definitions change, a lot. For example, for years we were told that carbs a good and red meat is the enemy. Now the trend is that carbs are evil and red meat isnt as bad as we once thought. Or that a vegetarian diet is much healthier than vegan or meat based. Thats not even getting into the supplement and diet industry thats backed by, you guessed it, science. In many cases, it could be very sound science. Im not a scientist, so I dont know. I can only attempt to make informed decisions.
What I really rail against is other peoples assumptions of me (and others) based on looks, alone. Too often Ive seen people of all shape, sizes and health levels cut down and jabbed at because of someone elses perception. I believe health, or lack of it, is something between a patient and medical team, not the world at large. Im all for people having opinions. Its just mine that a persons body is their own business. Ive seen Lizzo as advocating for people to take charge of their own lives and happiness, however they see that, and not let opinions of others get in the way. IE: You want to get healthier? Do it because you decided to, because you made an informed decision - not because someone on the internet said you were unhealthy."
TwoXChromosomes,fdvsmw2,t1_fduuds7,1578751112.0,"I think surrogacy is a wonderful thing, just maybe not right for me. We started looking for a surrogate almost two years ago and had some promising leads, but most ended up in disappointment before we even got to the phone call stage. No one close to us was willing / able, so we started looking around for others. Imagine, if you will, a great bar filled with desperate, deserving, wonderful people who are looking for one person who fits one narrow set of criteria. Everyone in the place is looking for that one and the bar is filled to the point where theres only one person who can fit the criteria for every thousand people already there. Then it becomes a bidding war when that one person walks in - bidding for time, attention, personality, and yes, even money.

Surrogates looking to match can be overwhelmed. Its not uncommon for a potential surrogate to have upwards of fifty to a hundred prospective parents vying for her attention. And the hard part hasnt even begun. Next is a long series of doctor visits, negotiations, contracts, psychological checks and background checks. All hugely necessary steps. The part that started leaving a bad taste in my mouth, even though it was honest and up front, was the attitudes of more and more surrogates. Many would talk about the altruism, then turn around and talk about how they could get more money from International intended parents. Or Id get ghosted. Or Id connect with someone only to find out she really didnt meet the criteria, or was a little...off. Think of it like very high stakes internet dating.

Then theres the possibility of going through an agency. Add at least another $30-40k to the already $100k bill. And theres no guarantee of getting matched with a surrogate.

On top of infertility issues for a heterosexual couple, the stigma of not being woman enough to carry your own baby kicks in - at least it did for me. Single sex or even single people looking for a surrogate have it even worse in some respects. Its an incredibly complex, deeply personal and intimate process that takes an emotional toll. Many of the potential surrogates I talked with approached things from a very business-like mindset - transactional. And thats perfectly valid. It just didnt feel right at all to me to ask so, how much will it cost to borrow your body for a year to eighteen months? 

And that didnt even factor in the discomfort of jumping into the shark infested waters of surrogate hunting, the idea that there were other people more worthy, or the really uncomfortable feeling of being desperate to find THE ONE. Its an incredibly difficult and draining / wearing process the requires a woman, especially, to make herself utterly vulnerable. Youre asking another woman to do something that should be as natural as breathing, that millions of other women can do without thinking about it.

Ok, that went on longer than Id planned, but its a small peek into the mind of an intended parent. All of the things Ive mentioned were my own experience - mileage may vary! Long story short, I got turned off by the transactional nature of things."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdul1ha,t3_emypfh,1578734592.0,"I saw somewhere else on Reddit a post about Lizzo and lifestyle, and the author made a damned good point. Lizzo seems to get more exercise in one show than most get in a week. Shes not only on stage, shaking her ass, in HEELS, in a high energy show, while belting out notes theyd hear in the parking lot WITHOUT amplification. Thats, conservatively, 90m a show of aerobic exercise, not including the countless hours of rehearsal. Her message has been love yourself, but nowhere have I seen her say you cant do what you think is better for YOU. Its not about celebrating an unhealthy lifestyle. Its about giving people permission to feel comfortable in their own skin and make choices from a place of information, not a place of depression born of relentless bullying and negativity.

And dont EVEN get me started on the medical industrial complex. An entity that cant even agree on the simple shit. One day we have a food pyramid, the next its a hexagon, then it becomes an MLM scheme and it all ends in tears.

It all boils down to a very simple thing: Other peoples bodies are none of anyone elses goddamned business. Period. Male, female, non binary, cis, trans, black, purple, thin, fat, physically challenged...no.one.elses.business. And make no mistake: The football star whos battling anorexia, the theater kid struggling with bulimia, the celebrated singer whos fat? Theyre all going through the same things, the same judgements and the same challenges. Were here to love and support. If all you want to do is tear someone down for their choices?
