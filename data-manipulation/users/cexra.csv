it’s great that you’re having conversations about this, it’s definitely hard to be with someone when they aren’t compatible with your sexual needs. i would definitely sit him down and make sure he knows how you’re feeling. less sex can lead to self esteem issues and resentment on your end. 

once anything serious/medical/hormonal is ruled out, you should consider if it’s worth working through and finding a balance or ending things (worse case scenario). i know how it feels and i wish you the best of luck."
