My aim is terrible though. :/"
thedivision,fer0s8y,t3_eq3nba,1579348300.0,"Funny little story: I was in dz west yesterday with a friend and we both got downed trying to get a drop by the npcs and a random patrol pinching us. Some guy came by and stole our gear. We followed him, went rogue, and killed him to get our stuff back. Shortly after, He tried to roll up on us at a nearby landmark but I saw him before he flagged the rogue button. We started dancing around each other so I held the rogue button but released it just before we the rogue status took effect. It was too late - he pulled out his GL and nuked himself. 

I laughed so hard I got light-headed."

thedivision,feh2hd9,t3_ep10a6,1579107766.0,Indeed. Pretty irritating how a single grenade from the GL can kill most enemies weaker than elites. Yet a .50 round to the head of a True Son heavy gunner barely dents his armor.

thedivision,fdc2mph,t1_fdc28ob,1578265880.0,Hell yeah. When they roll up I destroy their skills with the jammer and drop my seekers(all 3 mod slots have 96% damage or higher)  and get into cover. I also run firm handshake so I get bonus weapon damage from applying disrupt. If I could have more armor it'd be amazing. But I can only have 4 blue attributes or less to be able to use payload.
thedivision,fdc1oga,t3_ekk8nv,1578265365.0,"I got a pair last week but couldn't think of a build to make with them. I eventually made a build consisting of sawyers kneepads, a backpack with tech support, and payload. So when the pulse destroys an enemy skill, I get bonus skill damage and +50% explosive damage. I have destructive on my mask and an extra 17% explosive damage from gear mods. It's pretty nice against players in the DZ. But, I'm a little squishy."
