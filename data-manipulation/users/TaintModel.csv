RocketLeague,ffgf07j,t1_ffgb260,1579904759.0,"Seriously, if you have a good connection, don’t spend money on virtual shit and play on a widely used platform then nothing that’s happened recently has changed the game. They don’t want to waste money anymore supporting a vocal minority of players, it makes good business sense. This change affects what, 3% of players? At 41,000 average players that means they’re only losing approximately 1,200 people on average that they would have had to dedicate extra time and resources to. That’s less than the number of new player’s they’ve gained in the last month. It isn’t worth it."
