AmItheAsshole,fgus5aa,t1_fgurwj6,1581128182.0,"Yes I agree. There must have been a prompt that was missed. Either sent by email, on the syllabus, or communicated some way that wasn’t right on the online forum. I had that happen in my last online class, apparently there was a rubric for online posts buried in the class information so I missed some requirements for citations and length on the first and second assignments.

Edit: also it doesn’t hurt to reach out to the professor. “Hi, sorry if my post came off as not serious, it wasn’t my intention. I just wanted to see if my post was removed due to the joking tone or if maybe I missed a prompt? Again, it wasn’t my intention to be disrespectful in any way and I apologize. Any feedback is appreciated.”"
