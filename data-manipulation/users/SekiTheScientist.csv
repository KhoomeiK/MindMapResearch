instantkarma,ff5aijc,t3_ermnta,1579585252.0,What is the point of breaking like this. I dont get why they do this
StarWars,feoidad,t3_eq495k,1579300564.0,Waw... it is a solid. You only need to fix that little black line in the lower half and try adding a bit blue-slight green murkiness under the water otherwise it is TOP

educationalgifs,fd39sir,t1_fd06j7r,1578156124.0,I fully agree but we dont know if all of the wool reacted or not thus the reaction needs to be perfect if we want to calculate the weight of oxygen
