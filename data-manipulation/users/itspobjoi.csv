TwoXChromosomes,ff8lyw9,t3_es6dlx,1579685066.0,"First and foremost. You asked him to stop or not to do it and he refused. He chose his sexual pleasure over your comfort.

I don't know and I don't care if he has some hidden rape play fantasy that he acted out because he thought it was the only way he could get it but him making light of this act and even more so gaslighting you about this is incredibly wrong.  There is no excuse for his behaviour at all.  This sort of behaviour can soil and tarnish trust and confidence.  Marriage should have both of these this, it should be your safe space. 

Additionally, anal isn't just ""something's couples do"" I've been with my partner a while and we both expressed an interest of trying anal together (he's done anal with past girl friends and I like anal play *sometimes*) he'd never take it further than I could handle (only fingers so far and that's fine) and stops when I ask.

You can't ""just do"" anal. That's not how it works. It's not like a vagina. You can't go in without warm up or lubrication and wing it (and as a note, I don't fucking endorse this either). It's incredibly *painful* not to mention dangerous (tears , prolapsing , you get the picture).

From what I've read you really need to re-evaluate this relationship. You have a right to feel safe in your home. Sex should be when both parties want it not when one party decides or has an ""accident”. 

Just because it went in doesn’t mean you were ready. Him trying to swing this around saying something like that, or your pain tolerance or you “taking the situation the wrong way” is him trying to deflect blame, guilt, embarrassment and most importantly, *consequences*


This. Is not. Okay."

PlantBasedDiet,ff4ioyj,t3_ereosy,1579564554.0,"Some people have nut allergies.

Economically avocados, nuts , seed and nut butters can be quite expensive. Not everything is available everywhere.

WFPB and even just PB requires a fair bit of planning and volume to appropriately satisfy calorific and nutritional needs. So yes, I can understand :p 

Time, allergies, geographic location,  money, nutrition, portion acceptability. There are many reasons why people can struggle.

What matters most is that we are trying our best at the time :)"

Whether this is a challenge or not is subjective to peoples marmite/vegemite taste. I , for one, can happily eat it by the spoonful! (Teaspoon that is ;))

Also, make sure to stay hydrated , vegemite has a lot of sodium in it :)"
TwoXChromosomes,ff4ggqz,t1_ff49iu7,1579563023.0,"I don't believe you're  at fault. I was speaking with friend of a friend. We met up one night , had sex and the condom broke. No big deal , accidents happen. Until I spoke to my friend about it and he said ""oh yeah that's something he does on purpose and he's done it to a lot of girls"" 

He uses condoms that are too small for him (unfortunately this includes most regular size) , so they split and he can ejaculate inside people.

How people are saying ""don't get tricked"" or ""you should know"" is beyond me, the condom was still on him when he pulled out and he just played it off as an accident. 

I didn't realise I have to go full third party research and investigation on the sexual history of a person to sleep with them. What's trust worth nowadays anyway...."
TwoXChromosomes,ff4emg0,t1_ff4a4vh,1579561780.0,"I think the intent part heavily swings in favour of why it should be rape.  I've consented to have sex with someone one time and they proceeded to have sex with me whilst I was heavily intoxicated and without a condom on a different occasion (Two things I actively don't engage in outside committed relationships and I'm very clear about that)

This person wanted to have sex with me when I could not give consent (but I have in the past) and without a condom (at the time I wasn't on any birth control) . Should it not be the act and intent that classifies as rape? 

E.g they intended to have sex without a condom and had sex without a condom or they intended to have sex with that person so they did?


I don't see how the punishment should be different, not all rape is violent and aggressive. It can be mind games and manipulation ( the kind I have also personally experienced ). This includes the initiation of *non-consensual* sex.  

If a person consents to safe sex , sex that then puts their health at risk (either through UTI, STI, Infections , pregnancy, etc) becomes non-consensual.

Honestly saying someone got tricked is a foul perspective , it has negative connotations on the person's character. Nobody likes being tricked , there is a level of guilt that then manifests, and this is before any serious and potentially life long ramifications. 

All for a person's  temporary gratification, be it sexual or power."
xxfitness,ff2igr1,t3_eqyvys,1579507573.0,"Don't feel bad about getting form wrong, I had PT sessions when I first started and I still lost my form (PT expensive to maintain)  the best thing that worked for me was recording myself and also watching YouTube videos. I found the cues that work for me and my (powerlift equivalent) squat fell into place. 

Every body is different,  I am 5'9 and my femurs are the same length as my entire torso , so my mechanics and leverage are different to a lot of folk. 

It's all about finding what works for you and your body , it's a skill which takes time to develop. :)"
