politics,fekzp5l,t1_fekpk2c,1579210958.0,"This doesn't answer the question though, it doesn't appear that the gao's assessment was based on Trump's specific reasons for not fulfilling his obligations, but rather his lack of follow through in doing so and broadness in reasoning. If that is the case how is his withholding any different than literally any previous administration's similar actions be it Biden and Ukraine or any number of similar by past leaders of the executive branch?

Evidently Trump's official reasoning (per GAO website) was an extremely broad “in a manner that could conflict with the President’s foreign policy.”  which the GAO rejects. Do you know what was Biden's reasoning, so we can clearly lay out the difference? I have thus far been unable to find it and feel this would be a much better answer to defeat such questions rather than just saying ""whataboutism"" and ending the conversation there."
DragaliaLost,fekxyyg,t3_ep2hwz,1579209921.0,"Best advice I have... Get volcanic chimera weapon maxed. Run agito standard to get used to difficult content and to get the fire tree upgraded as much as you can (don't buy 6*). Build a Xania for all of this. Use chimeratech weapon on hms using Xania. If the baiter is good you shouldn't have to react too terribly much. 

Once you get to the point where you can comfortably clear ehms and build a green weapon build a blade for victor or sword for Welly. Victor is easier since he doesn't have to bait. Welly is a bit harder for baiting and eating some bubbles, but still not too terrible. Just don't be Noelle, she's the main bait and the core to a solid run, so if you don't like that stress play something one of the others. Kirsty or Joachim may also work now. Your role should be to stand in the upper left as much as possible. Look into how to properly dragon for the second waterfall, and just try not to let yourself get too frustrated by complete lack of communication losses at first waterfall, you'll get used to it.

After this build a ice wand and take on hbh. Not much advice here, you just have to run it till you learn it. If you don't have Lily then try one of the other roles (healer or bait) but understand that this is a bigger learning curve, so watch videos, practice and have patience. 

Rinse and semi-repeat for light/shadow, but tbh you probably won't get there till next agito and probably more shadow 70s come out so don't worry about those for now."

You recognized that your rate was too high for babysitting, you could have common sensed that 35 is too high in your area as well. In these cases a simple firm no is less offensive even after they offer to pay you. If you wanted to explain you could have offered the same explanation you offered here saying you had a job lined up to make $X during that time and so will not be available.
