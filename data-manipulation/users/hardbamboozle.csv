depression,fgesmqd,t3_ey0nbd,1580708564.0,"Isolation. Nothing hurts more than having no one to talk to. No friends, family or partner. The thing with isolation is that it is a circle you can hardly escape. When people wanted to include me in something I usually distance myself from them even though I don't want to be alone."
depression,fg1v6qf,t1_fg1pn77,1580433684.0,Don't let reddit therapist evaluate how real your depression is. Please seek real help.
MortalKombat,ffcl8le,t1_ffca809,1579801839.0,"Today a guy raged so hard because I knew how to block all of his strings. He literally screamed: ""you fucking piece of shit you know how to block everything."" It was so funny because he started to scream like a crazy person and he said I'm probably as ugly in real life as Kollector (which is true). I've been playing fighting games for a while now but never have I encountered someone who raged this hard.

He played Raiden and had a good record but since I knew that the last hit of Raiden's electric bubble (IDK what's it called) is a high I just ducked it and punished him. I didn't play like an asshole either, he just couldn't take it that I know a block button exists."
depression,fes82ni,t3_eqf8ns,1579362372.0,Reading helped me for a while. I hated to read but then I read a book in English (German is my native language) and I couldn't stop. Definitely helped me to put suicidal thoughts away for a moment.
Games,ferzqoi,t3_eq4i8y,1579359974.0,What's the name of the game on the upper right corner?
HolUp,fed4l6n,t3_eo2z2t,1578998554.0,Is this a Harry Potter reference?
MortalKombat,fcdlik4,t3_egxdw5,1577611120.0,"MK Twitter also tweeted ""Presents came early this season!""
Presents are usually free. I bought it but I don't like how they phrased the tweet acting like they gave us something for Christmas for free."
