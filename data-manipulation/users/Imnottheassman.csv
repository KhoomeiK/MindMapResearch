heroesofthestorm,fds4jdi,t3_emu4ye,1578694188.0,"I’m only a low Platinum, but I’ve played Probius more than any other hero (and climbed with him) and have him at around lvl 40. Here’s my two cents:  
  
A well-played Prob is overpowered in Bronze and most of Silver, as many players have no idea how to handle him or underestimate his burst. However, once you’re in Gold and Platinum, he begins to lose his potency, as opposing players know enough to avoid getting blown up or by counter picking, and your teammates often aren’t coordinated enough to take advantage of what he has to offer. This said, if you have an organized team that does communicate, he can still be really powerful, and I find his value goes back up when playing with Diamond and Masters players. 
  
I generally prefer to play Probius in the solo lane, but at higher levels, this pretty much requires your teammates to be calling out or pinging when enemies are missing. You also need to spend half your time looking at the minimap. (In lower leagues, the latter is generally sufficient.)  Later in the game, your priority is clearing lanes and camps (which you basically do better than any other hero) and forcing the other team to respond to pressure on the other side of the map, as an unchecked Probius can wreck towers and forts very quickly. Re: team fights, this is where you need to make the strategic decision as to whether you’ll get more value in the fight or split pushing. But if you’re not communicating, be prepared for other players to talk shit when you miss out on team fights, even if (and you often are) you’re providing more value elsewhere. 
  
I almost always go canon build in the solo lane (canon talents at 1 and 7), but if you have other dedicated laners, I’ll instead go Q build. (Q-build timing does take practice however.)

Tl/dr: Probius requires constant attention on the minimap and has maximal value with his macro potential. This works at low and high levels, but in my experience falls off in the middle tiers. He also has a number of really hard counters, like Hammer, Li Ming, Guldan, Varian, and Lunara, so it’s a risk to draft him early unless you have a coordinated team."
