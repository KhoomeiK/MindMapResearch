Are you American? This is a Canadian sub, so if you are might I suggest that our cultures are vastly different and that you may not have much experience with the Canadian system. Likely, you are talking about a system you are obviously unfamiliar with. If not, why are you choosing American examples?

Now you really are making ad hominem attacks.

Is there a reason \*your\* source is from a debt consolidation organization? Pot, meet kettle.

And now you are blathering on about the arts?? Why are you moving the goalposts of the discussion? If you really wanted to get into it, I could really be the devil's advocate and ask why you think artists are entitled to other people's money. Why not give that money to small businesses to employ others instead?  At this point, you're making values-based judgements on wealth redistribution. Then again, this coming from a supposed 'business owner' who writes

I feel like you also are not so bluntly hiding your political views, and I highly doubt you are a business owner.

canada,fct097t,t1_fcsyxwv,1577929532.0,"Ah, attacking the source. A common logical fallacy. 

If you’re actually interested in getting educated on these things, you’re more than welcome to peruse statistics Canada. All this information is publicly available. And you should really question how you look at things if your worldview is based on made-up data. For example, stating that the bottom 50% live on ‘subsistence wages’ [citation needed...again]. 

And again, I really feel that you are completely misunderstanding me. I still feel like you have a straw-man image of me that you are arguing against, instead of what I am saying. At the core, you still haven’t addressed what I am saying - that if we want nation pharmacare and dental care, properly afforded and funded, we need to broaden our tax base. I am not talking about taxing the poor out the whazoo. I’m talking about stopping this national charade about the so-called ‘struggling middle class’, a class that we’ve made a minister to look after who cannot even offer a simple definition of her constituency. Data shows that the middle class has been growing and doing *very* well, and politicians keep offering them various baubles (tax cuts on having kids, for the arts, for sports, etc) which endlessly complicates the tax code. 

They have done surveys where even people making 80-120K* have stated that they felt they were ‘middle class’. And these very people are often offered preferential tax status, all while national programs are created and touted to benefit them to the exclusion of all others. The truth is, they are not a tax bracket, they are an electoral constituency. And unless we broaden our tax brackets so that everyone pays in fairly, we will simply never be able to afford the generous social programs that politicians of middling-intelligence seem to think will fund themselves."
canada,fcsy1do,t1_fcsonq0,1577927971.0,"Where are you getting this top 20% making 90% of the wealth stat? Have you a citation for this?

Take a look at this. 
>the top 20 per cent of income earners in Canada—families with an annual income greater than $186,875—will earn 49.1 per cent of all income in Canada but pay 55.9 per cent of all taxes including not just income taxes, but payroll taxes, sales taxes and property taxes, among others.
...
By comparison, the bottom 50 per cent of income-earning families in Canada earn 20 per cent of all income, but pay just 14.6 per cent of all taxes.

https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/measuring-the-distribution-of-taxes-in-canada

Similarly, from the financial post

https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/taxes/trudeau-is-right-40-of-canadians-dont-pay-income-taxes-which-means-someone-else-is-picking-up-the-bill/amp

> with income ranging from zero to $80,843, representing the bottom 40 per cent of households by income, and found they paid 4.6 per cent of all the personal tax paid.

So, your stats don’t really line up, and your viewpoint is only supportable if you ignore the evidence. 

Why are you against our society paying for things that will help people? Have you no empathy for the poor?

Of course I’m being prickly there, but it’s to make a point. Anyone can claim that their neighbour is a stingy bastard when they are the one who is expected to pick up the tab. If we want a fairer tax system that allows us to look after the true poor, we need to broaden to tax base."
canada,fcsckp0,t1_fcrrqst,1577914648.0,"You are still ignoring the main thrust of my comments, and I’m not sure you’re understanding what my point is. It’s possible it may be because you are creating a straw-man argument in your mind where you think I am anti-tax, which is far from true. 

Also, your personal anecdotal experience is not sufficient evidence to prove a hypothesis that hard work and wealth aren’t correlated. I worked very hard to get where I am and I am comfortable. Had I not worked hard and sacrificed, I would not be where I am today. Does this prove that I am correct any more than you? Of course not. An N of 1 means nothing. 

My argument is that if we want the health care options and statist society that you think will best serve canadians, we have to expand the tax base to pay for it. I’ve said this three times now. We can’t just expect to ‘tax the rich’ to death and see it pay off, because experience says it doesn’t. Instead we see brain drain, an increase in tax avoidance strategies, and a decrease in productivity. It’s simply immoral to confiscate half of a human being’s wealth while simultaneously clamouring for them to ‘pay their fair share’. The top 20% already pay 65% of all taxes. How much more until it is ‘fair’? We should be thankful that they already shoulder the massive financial burden for the rest of us. 

If we as a society want these benefits, then we must broaden the tax base to pay for it. It is not a valid strategy to demand services but pass along the bill when it comes time to pay for it. We will *all* have to chip in more. Politically it’s a dangerous conversation to have, but our constant demands for more services without concomitant increases in taxation will only leave us with an overburdened and ineffectual health care system. And if ultimately people refuse this approach, well, that lays bare the truth that we’re all happy to call for more government services as long as someone else has to pay for it. It’s easy to pretend to be virtuous and for others when it’s on someone else’s dime."
canada,fcrmcwg,t1_fcrjjli,1577903694.0,"My favourite part was when you responded with general belief statements about taxes being good instead of addressing the issues I raised in good faith. 

I never said anything about taxes being bad...just that we can’t keep expecting to broaden the state with things like national pharmacare and not have to pay the bill for it. This means broadening the tax base, and raising taxes, yes, on the ‘middle class’. If you go too far on the Laffer  curve you’ll end up with more organized attempts at tax evasion as people say ‘fuck this’ to paying >60% of their hard-earned income in taxes, while watching politicians give tax breaks and further benefits to people who already receive a substantial net benefit of wealth transfer despite paying little to no taxes. And it’s important to note that we do not have a defined definition of what middle class actually is (not even the ‘minister for the middle class’ could say what that actually means), so we’re seeing people who are already pretty well off not paying their fair share of taxes while enjoying substantial benefit from those who do (and then some). 

If you look again, you’ll see that my comment isn’t about taxes being bad, just that we need to more fairly distribute them if we wish to afford the things we want to have."
canada,fcriavw,t1_fcre732,1577902184.0,"Probably because the top marginal tax rate in many several provinces is now at 53%...and people are pissed off at working over half the year for free. 

Unfortunately, the tax changes brought in by Morneau and company don’t target the super-rich (see: refusal to tax stock options) and so you see these tax changes typically only affecting small business owners / professionals like lawyers, accountants and doctors, who carry significant operating costs and aren’t ‘wealthy’ by the standards we usually apply. 

These people also have sacrificed the prime of their lives studying while making no money and have incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to get where they are, often having $3-5K a month in servicing debt costs, all while not having any pension, sick days or benefits. 

They also pay the vast majority of taxes in this country - the top 20% pay 65% of all taxes. This is already a pretty progressive system, and at some point we have to be politically brave and realize that in order to pay for the things we want we have to broaden the tax base.
