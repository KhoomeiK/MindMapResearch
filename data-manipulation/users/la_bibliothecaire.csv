None of them did a proper exam, never mind any tests, it was just stress.

The doc sent me off to a gastroenterologist, who stuck a camera down my throat and diagnosed celiac disease.

For my dog, I had several conversations with the rescue's adoption coordinator so they could tell me about their available dogs and suggest which ones might be a good match based on my lifestyle, home, and tastes, gave her a Skype tour of my yard, and provided them with the names of my vet and a personal reference (they called so fast that I didn't have a chance to alert my rabbi that I'd given them her name as a personal reference, she was confused with a dog rescue called her asking about me).

I picked her after seeing pictures and talking to the adoption coordinator about their temperaments, so she was mine before she got on the transport north. I guess picking a dog without meeting it was a bit risky, but the rescue has an excellent reputation, and it worked out very well. She's sweet, smart, healthy, and doesn't try to eat the cats.
