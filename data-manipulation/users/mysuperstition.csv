I thought he had picked the right girl in the end but unfortunately, they couldn't make it work.  I don't remember why.

I don't think he had the ability to leave town because he was responsible for running the family business (farming).  It was something that had been in the family for generations, if I remember correctly, so I think he was committed to not letting that go.

I think that was a deal breaker for a lot of the women and I can't say that I blame them.  If it was a small town within close proximity to a bigger city, it'd be a little different but I seem to remember it being literally in the middle of nowhere--no restaurants, no businesses, nothing."

DuggarsSnark,ffp5fmd,t3_eub28p,1580086701.0,"I'm sure the Duggar's are overwhelmed with babies at this point.  There've been so many babies in that house over the past 30 years that they're kind of burned out on babies.  I'm sure they love them but that special-ness is probably lacking.

Kendra's family doesn't have nearly as many kids and these 2 babies are the first grandkids.  I think there's probably more excitement and appreciation from her family because this is new and novel."

Sometimes, though, I just really don't care for the lead--I will refrain from naming names since I've been attacked for disliking a certain someone--and I don't mind hoping for the biggest train wreck.

I wish I was more evolved than that.  Normally, I am.  I promise. :-)

I think the premise is terrible though.  I've told my kids so many times that you don't ever fight over a person like these people do.  If a man wants to be with you, he'll move mountains to be with you.  You don't lower yourself like this show forces you to."

CountingOn,ffnu3yk,t1_ffns92w,1580070846.0,"I don't  believe it happened the way they said it did.  I think Jill probably woke up to it and told her parents when she couldn't take it anymore.  I think that's why Josh described Jill as being a tattler.  I would guess the parents then went after Josh, put the fear of God in him and made him confess.  You know he didn't confess all of it and you know he sugar coated what he did tell.  I really believe this is much , much deeper than we've been told."

CountingOn,ffnpp9f,t3_eubna7,1580069059.0,"In my opinion, I believe that he DID touch Jana.  I think the abuse with all the girls was far more traumatic than has been reported.  The other girls said it happened while they ""slept"" so they didn't know what was happening.  If they were sleeping they wouldn't know it had happened though, so how would they have been able to report it?  I believe that is something they have convinced themselves of for 2 reasons.

1. They won't have to talk about it.
2. They've literally blocked the memories because of the trauma.

I don't think Jana was spared.  I think Jana is much more introverted than the others and I think she was too fragile to actually talk about it.  Because she buried it, it was assumed she went untouched."

She was able to confront people without drama and she appeared to be a person with good values (basically the unicorn of reality tv).

I was excited when I found out she'd be returning but I didn't care for her at all the second time around.  She seemed like a completely different person.  She appeared to be very arrogant and condescending and like she felt she was literally better than everyone else.  It seemed so hypocritical because she espouses being a good Christian and she was very exclusionary and holier-than-thou.  It was highly disappointing so I'd rather not have her back. :-("

It's been 7 years and 3 cats and she no longer has any issue.  I also have a friend whose allergies were very severe and her allergist told her she had no choice but to get rid of the cats.  She refused and is fine as long as she takes daily allergy medicine.
