CrappyDesign,ffaaplo,t1_ffa71z7,1579731199.0,"Maybe you're right, but it doesn't matter, it's still a shitty design. 

Looking at it from the philosophical perspective would be of better use, were the tracks to remain separate. Having a ""maybe they get warned in time"" is useless to the question. 

There is no need, philosophically, to go deeper than ""would you take action that kills someone who would otherwise live; to save five (or 3, or 2, or whatever) that would otherwise die through your inaction?"" 

That's it. That's the question. It doesn't need superfluous additions. Philosophy doesn't need flair. The ""trolly"" is to help those who learn through pictures, but the traditional two tracks is enough for that.

The only time you add things to the question, is when someone actually *chooses* one track over the other. Then you see how far that ""choice"" stretches. IE, ""what if the one is a child"" or ""what if the five are elderly or sick or criminals?"" or ""what if there's only a 50/50 chance of saving the five if you kill the one?"" Because the question isn't meant to be answered."

Im sure it has nothing to do with the ethnic, religious, and langauge diversity Afghanistan has always had. Or, y'know, the political ramifications of england, persia and russia using it as a buffer zone. Or england freeing up the countries surrounding it of english rule. 

Having it become a puppet ingdom of the Soviet union had nothing to do with the state of the country either, im sure. Or the US, its need to counter its political opponent. 

Nothing to do with Pushtun nationalism scaring the fuck out of Pakistan, making them put their influence in the area in a way that was more effective than either the soviet or the US governments. Putting tribe against tribe, pushing Islamic political agenda where it could. 

Sure, lets put the weight of this on the CIA for sending arms and money to Afghan insurgents. Oh wait, that was *also* delivered by Pakistan, so they could protect Pakistani influence. 

Maybe you're talking about American planners welcoming Arab volunteers to help the Afghani in battle.

The same volunteers that we neither recruited, hired, or trained.
