opera,ff743za,t3_er0lxv,1579640728.0,"I'd like to make the entire excursion an event.   It doesn't have to be fancy or expensive - IMO some of the best food is in the ""hole in the wall"" tiny restaurants with little to no decor, where the chef puts all his/her effort into the quality of the food itself.   

Naturally there will be excellent dining experiences anywhere an opera house is to be found - they tend to not build them in the middle of cornfields - but some advanced research about maximizing your experience surrounding the visit to the opera is important too.   So I'd want to know about food and lodging options.   

I'd also be inclined to pick a handful of your favorite performers and check their schedules - I'll bet you would start spotting trends of where all the great ones perform.   Some might be obvious (Paris, London, Milan, etc.) while others might surprise you.   

Transportation is big.   In NYC I learned last time that it's worth the $50 (round trip, not including tip) to hire a car service rather than fight the crowds and wait forever (especially lousy in inclement weather) for a taxi or subway.  It's a bit pricey but it's a splurge that makes the entire event go smoothly, so logistics are huge - you don't want to sit through a three hour opera if your shoes are soaking wet from trudging through the rain.

Another treat: not just what food/drink is available at intermission, but what can be ordered ahead of time/online?   At intermission, taking your time to hit the restrooms and then stroll to the bar to find your drink waiting for you vs. standing in line and hoping to get noticed before it's time to return to your seats is another great perk."

Showerthoughts,fecg897,t1_fecdrrx,1578973164.0,"And you can thank your friendly federal government for that.  

You see, if you go to college and take Econ 101, you’ll learn about the laws of supply and demand.  So let’s apply them. Given:

- Q(s), the *quantity supplied* - that is, the number of degree granting institutions and the degrees granted thereby - stays the same, and

- Q(d), the *quantity demanded* - that is, the number of students **willing and able** (more on this in a moment) to pay for college *increases*, then

- P, “price” - that is, the price of tuition - will **increase**. 

**Willing and able** are key terms you’ll also learn in Econ 101.  Because if you’re not willing, then you won’t spend the money.  If you’re not able, then you don’t have the money to spend.  

The federal government, in its seemingly good-intentioned attempt to make “college more affordable” by guaranteeing student loans, made it easier for students to be **able** to pay for college.   That is to say, the colleges let them finance it because the loans were backed by Uncle Sam.  In much the same way that a sleazy car salesman doesn’t care that you have to eat ramen noodles breakfast lunch and dinner so as to make the car payments, so long as he closes the sale and sells you the car.  

And following the laws of supply and demand as outlined above, the ever present laws of unintended consequences strikes again: **it is the federal backing of student loans that caused the price of tuition to skyrocket**.  

It’s unequivocal.   It’s basic economics.  That’s not a reflection of society; that’s a reflection of (yet again) terrible Liberal policies.   

You can’t legislate away basic economics.

Look back throughout history - throughout *all* of history - as a species, our default position has always been one of poverty.

Every year society makes advances - largely through the private ownership of resources and self-determination, thank you very much - and makes members of society on the whole a tiny bit better off.   

The question isn't ""how did this generation get so poor?""; the question is ""how have other generations gotten so rich?""   

Learn that, and do it.

You'll find the answer astonishingly simple: Work hard.  Work often.  Save your money.  Live within your means.  Scrimp and save.  Do without.  Decide what is and what is not important, and expunge the unimportant from your life.   Strive every day to better yourself.  Physically, mentally, educationally.

If you have a 401(k), 403(b), or certain other retirement accounts, you very likely **DO** own stock and you don't even realize it.   

Also, the overwhelming majority of stockholders hold their stock in what’s called “street name”.  That is, the individual shares of stock aren’t registered under the actual stockholder’s name; instead they’re registered only in the name of the institution handling the investment.  

There’s a lot of paperwork involved in getting stocks registered under your name.  Paper certificates reprinted, physical items to be signed, notarized, and transferred.   The process takes days.  Which makes it impossible to transact if you’re trying to buy or sell shares RIGHT NOW.  

It’s kind of like making a personal check out to “Cash” instead of naming an actually payee; whoever is holding it is eligible to cash it.  

Since 99% of stocks are held in street name, there is NO way of determining if the owner is rich or not.
