wokekids,ffiw7yz,t1_ffiuzln,1579984202.0,"I actually did the study myself! It's really interesting to me! Although it would be nice to simply take a quote and then run with it, that's simply not always the case. 

For instance, let's say that you have a little brother. Your little brother annoys you greatly and you yell, ""I'm going to kill him!"" You then proceed to chase him around the house until you grab him and punch him on his leg. 

Now, I hear you scream ""I'm going to kill him"" and I get worried. So instead of investigating why you said it, I get a gun out and shoot you. Seems fair to me because I'm reacting off of what I heard

This is why context is important. If you don't know why someone said something, then you cant judge accurately what actually happened."

wokekids,ffiu9p5,t3_etqrm1,1579982878.0,"Midianites were given many opportunities to quit their pagan practices (child sacrifice and temple prostitutes where woman were enslaved and put into temples to be raped by anyone as an act of worship. Those are just a few! They worshiped the god of BAAL). When Israel was taking the land that God has given them, God ensured that the people had opportunities to choose to turn from their sin. Unfortunately, the midianites and people of Jericho and some others did not turn from their sin (some people of their cities did! Look at Rahab in Joshua 5). 

Another important factor: back then, if a woman did not have a husband then they were doomed to death because they did not have a way to take care of themselves. God actually saved those people by allowing them to join the Israelites. Also, God didn't tell Israel to rape the woman. He implied that they be married. Arranged marriages were the norm back then. The woman had the chance to get married and to have families (back then, having a family was the greatest honor you could have). 

Hopefully I wrote clearly. I'm sorry if I didn't!"

offmychest,ffexgcq,t1_ffestzn,1579869401.0,"The electoral college is the only reason that voting is fair....I'm not sure why people don't see that. 

If the electoral college didn't exist, then there would be no need for states with less population to vote. 

Most major cities in America vote Democrat because Democrats tend to be more socialist. Living in big cities costs more money, so people buy into the idea that raising minimum wage to $20.00 will solve all their problems. (It won't)

Thus, if the vote was for the majority, then most Americans wouldn't need to vote. Cities like Chicago, La, and New York would get to decide all the elections. 

I'm not being very clear. I'm sorry. 

Basically what I mean is that America is huge in terms of land. There are many socio economic levels and different lifestyles experienced across the country. People in New York don't know what life is like in Alabama, yet if there were a popular vote, then New York would get to decide everything because they have more people."
offmychest,ffewy8z,t3_et5uoo,1579868885.0,"You have freedom to go wherever you want. 

No one forces you to go to college and most careers have avenues that you can still pursue without schooling. 

If you have good health insurance (lots of jobs give decent coverage), then you don't have to pay for most of your cancer bills.

You have the freedom to believe in any religion

You have the freedom to eat whatever and whenever you want

You have the freedom to walk most streets in America without having to wonder if a bomb is going to blow your home up. 

You have the freedom to pursue any career (even after you've started or even finished schooling for a different one)you have the freedom to marry whoever you want. 

You have the freedom to carry a weapon so that you can protect yourself and your family from harmful people (including a tyrannical government). 

The list goes on...and on...and on......

Is America perfect? No (not even close).

Does living in America offer you more freedom than 95% of the world? Yes."

worldnews,fe5dduw,t1_fe3nfnx,1578868036.0,"Never said the left is evil. They simply ignore all other sources other than their own. The funny thing is, so does the right. Everyone just looks at their own sources and buys into the truth. It's comical. But again, my main point of trump easily winning I believe stands."
worldnews,fe32k3f,t1_fe2yj3s,1578845278.0,Maybe because some of the people protesting are being killed for simply voicing their opinion?
worldnews,fe31vpk,t1_fe2zl2l,1578845150.0,"Maybe he's seeing the posts by actual Iranians who are staying that the man was monster? But idk. Maybe we just misinterpret that. The point is, most media is just filled with leftists who hate Trump (I don't like him either, but he did a good job this time). The funny thing is, the left feels as if they are the majority. Most of the people who are pro Trump do not voice their opinion on social media. It's hilarious. I remember when the election was happening and everyone thought Hilary was a guanrentee win. Trump's supporters just happen to be the working class, rather than the entitled fresh out of college want to be debt free without working hard students (I am one of these as well lol). Again, this is coming from someone who doesn't like Trump. The hypocracy of the left is simply too funny to watch. They want to impeach Trump, yet when they take it to the Senate, they don't use the same ""evidence?"" It's comical. This is my rant. I literally know nothing about politics but I find the current state amusing. Please just someone who isn't a crazy leftist run again Trump (maybe Bloomberg?)."

reddevils,fcsxiw0,t1_fcs6hv9,1577927612.0,"Lol. I'm called condescending, when you're the one shutting on a player who's been solid for us the whole season. I don't care that you've been to games. Yo say that Maguire is worthless in our team is preposterous. He didn't play well, but how many more games would Smalling or Jones have cost us at this point? I'm sick of people having big voices online against players who give their heart and soul for the club. Maguire, whether you like him or not, will be our captain next year, and yes deserved it!"
