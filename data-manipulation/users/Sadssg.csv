relationship_advice,fehmxw6,t3_ep720l,1579119803.0,"This is the similar situation of my current boyfriend. I have worked with my boyfriend for around 2 years now in april. When I started, we didnt speak properly for a year. Of course we spoke but it was only work related. I had a crush on him for ages but we were both shy. The way I got us talking is to be like ""hi, you okay?"" Be sweet and short to begin with."
relationship_advice,fehl2kb,t3_ep7czr,1579118720.0,"The best thing to do is talk to him before making any decision. You mentioned you both struggle with libido, well maybe find out the cause of the issue and work on it together. The first stage of  a relationship is the honey moon stage and it either make or break. Of course you will have more sex because you are getting used to one another and it's all fresh and new but when it dies down, this is not a red flag...its just you guys getting comfortable together but also a part. I can understand that your feeling your boyfriend is more than a friend than a boyfriend is because you feel that your not getting the affection and intimacy you deserve but he may feel the same way. Talk to him."

relationship_advice,fb9y6qp,t3_ec8ase,1576654876.0,"Counselling helps as it will work on your emotions in depth. It may be hard to be begin with but when you learn abour your emotions, you wont have to question yourself on how to stand up for yourself because it will become natural for you. It is important to stand up for yourself because if you dont; your emotions wont improve. Good luck man x"
