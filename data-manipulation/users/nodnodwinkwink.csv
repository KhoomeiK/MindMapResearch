The proportions are way off, the font is way too complicated for a logo. Big flowery fonts are not a good idea in general for a photographer because they will probably want to watermark their photos when sharing online. If it's too big and complicated then it distracts people from the photo. Shrink this particular font down and stick it on a photo and it becomes illegible.
