Kratom has given me complete anhedonia after long term use and quitting right noe isnt an option so im hoping i can hold off till 1 of my vacations for work come up. But i had alcohol on one occasion in between drug tests which i likely got passed by a smidgen im sure and it brought back some excitement. So i was hoping for that.  But nope now im tired and lethargic and kinda feeling really relaxed before work.ill up the dosage tmm after work and see if it has any euphoria but from what im experiencing its reall more like a benzo than alcohol

kratom,ff6twaa,t1_ff6mc3a,1579634788.0,Absolutely. Im at over 30gpd and quitting has been on a scale of 0-heroin withdrawal(10) its at an 8 right now. Ive tapered from a lot more.

Theres usually 3 servings per bottle i believe drink 1 every day with water. Supplements can dehydrate you to. But just keep at it the physical symptoms usually only last a week. Other symptoms can last anywhere from a month to a year or even 2 years. If you tapered im sure it wont last long. PAWS or Post acute withdrawal symptoms are lingering and for some can last up to 2 years. This doesnt mean youll have a headache for 2 years. After about a month of abstinence almost all your withdrawal should be gone. Your going to have ups and downs. Lets say your 3 months abstinent for example. Lets say march 18 makes 3 months. On the 19th you may feel like your in withdrawal again just for that day. The 20th youll be fine again. It happens. Opioids induce PAWS

quittingkratom,fcaiow8,t3_egu8fl,1577569915.0,"I can break this down for you youll be happy with the explanation, kratom DOES NOT lower testosterone. It raises prolactin levels. With high prolactin levels it can effect fertility libido and can cause ED. High prolactin lowers FREE TESTOSTERONE. Not TESTOSTERONE. I have studied effects opioids cause on FSH, LH, SHBG. Opioids raise prolactin over time. About two-thirds of testosterone circulates in the blood bound to sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and slightly less than one-third bound to albumin. A small percent (less than 4%) circulates as free testosterone. The free plus the albumin-bound testosterone is the bioavailable fraction, which can act on target tissues. One of the main regulators of the production of prolactin from the pituitary gland is the hormone called dopamine. Over time the release of dopamine from exterior sources (kratom) will in fact raise these levels and cause issues. It can take up to 6 months for your prolactin levels to stabilize. I found lowering my kratom dosage during my taper protocol has given me the ability to last longer again. I was to experiencjng severe premarure ejaculation."
