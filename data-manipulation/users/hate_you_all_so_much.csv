Lmfao.

I understand and can appreciate what you are saying as it has worked for you, but honestly, I disagree so fucking vehemently that I’ve rewritten how I feel multiple times, and don’t think I can really express it without a 2 page essay. 

Basically, I find it gross that you see it as a group culture type shit, because even though it obviously is, local communities I think exist and are accessible without becoming or doing many if not all of the things you listed. 

On top of that, the general advice feels more new age faggoty- no offence, faggot ;)- than a heterosexual should have to take on just to attend orgies. 

Like uhh, it sort of feels inorganic to have to take said steps I.e. homework, and changing yourself, just to have group sex? Are you fucking kidding me ? 

To be clear I’ve experienced these things, I’ve taken part, and I would never stop being an ignorant asshole to go back. 100% not worth changing for. 

I’ll venmo u money for a new leash bruv

edit:
to be clear obviously mental health at any age is something that we would hope is taken care of. I do agree that they may be suffering. 

However, to me it looks like a few things. I would like to know why teen suicide and cutting and mental disorders are regularly diagnosed now rather than before? is it more now? If so, why? Are they bored and suffocated and looking for attention? I dont know. 

On top of that, are there outward factors affecting these kids? Is there anything we, collectively as a society, can do to bring it back to them being happy? Change schools? No online? playing outside more? More positive family influence and involvement after school? I dont know, but I doubt it. Seems more like a secondary factor of something else. 


And honestly, the only reason its considered a problem now is because its been made into a problem. Society has changed, the world has changed, our focus has changed, and to think for a second you or we can do anything about it or should waste our time talking about it is fucking retarded. 

Go be a highschool counselor lmao"
OkCupid,fenlkpr,t3_epwrzg,1579287288.0,"Why the fuck are you doing actual math on any of this ? 

You already know the answer to what you are asking and that you are making it harder for yourself. 

That said, obviously there will be enough who are fine with that. You will be fine. What gets me though, is that by throwing down these massive barriers and expectations you are making it rather difficult for yourself to find someone you organically, naturally like. You are being clinical about this and unfortunately that’s not how feelings and emotions work. 

Just my thoughts. Good luck"

From what I’ve read a lot of modern art is worthless and although obviously used for fraud, are also used to pay people or to acquire favours.

Like u buy a 7mil$ painting for a 90mil$ favour, pay 90mil$ then sell it to someone else for another favour.

I wont get the days most likely, Because in my first 16 months I took 4 days off w/ 0 sick and used the rest of my vacation days for 3 hour appointments here and there. 

Part of the perks of going here was that if i had an afternoon appointment I’d get paid for the day, or sometimes they give Friday afternoons off.

Move forward and be a better person in every aspect forever. That and accept the way you feel won’t change for some time, that’s how I moved forward.
