I also signed up for the nw380 trial prep at bronze because I had a gift cert from Christmas. 

Lastly I'm entered in a giveaway for a bronze class on Instagram so if I win that I'm going to take cooperative care because that's always good to have in the library."

BUT friday night I said I would set some hides. I asked my fiance to place an unknown #1-3. First time doing this. Where does he place the hide? As an innaccessible IN THE COLD CLOSET. WITH ALL MY SPARE COLD CONTAINERS THAT I'VE COLLECTED OVER THE YEAR. AHHH 

Nosework peeps - I know youll feel my pain lol"

dogs,fdnwagc,t3_emaoq8,1578594146.0,"2 dogs in the house, one is our own one is a foster. We have:

2 Wire crates  
1 plastic travel crate  
1 Large soft crate  
1 small soft travel crate  
2 sets of baby gates  
1 large expen

I work 4 days a week, so I decided to test it out on my shorter (8 hour) days. I'll still be coming home on my 10 hour days, but this is so liberating! lol"

dogs,fdgxvpc,t1_fdgssm0,1578411011.0,"I don't have any of last nights session filmed, but I definitely can try again tonight and film it. The issue is that even if I click as soon as his back foot is on the target and rapid tire treat him in that position, he immediately wants to down as if it's a mat (i guess a testament to our mat training). Which is not the behavior I'm looking for."
dogs,fdgsa0r,t3_elc0og,1578407025.0,"Since January 1st, we've gotten Rory's novice and intermediate trick titles through do more with your dog which was SUPER fun. Rory already knew most of the tricks but still 27 tricks filmed in 5 days was no small feat! Love my little dude, he's so easy to train and so smart, he generalizes well and seems to know exactly what I am asking even when I don't say anything because he's a pro at offering behaviors. 

Which brings me to my next point. I want to teach him rear end awareness...how to Target with back paws as well as back up. This is NOT going well lol. He is so mat trained that any object on the ground his first thought is to offer a relaxed down. I even used a small lickimat, small sheet of paper, platform. I'm stuck and I don't know what to do!"

dogs,fct8jux,t3_eip0dh,1577935732.0,"If you are going to be coming in or out, such as with groceries, I recommend tethering. Attach a leash to a heavy piece of furniture or door, grab a mat or bed, and train him to relax while people come and go. If he does break his stay, he's tethered, so he won't be self reinforcing by running out the door"
dogs,fcqve2w,t1_fcqu149,1577892785.0,"Quite possibly an allergy, he also could have been stress licking it in his previous home - they were gone 12 hours a day and he has seperation anxiety. 

It's not looking better or worse with the cream, just kind of there. 

Since he's a foster, I have to get approval from the rescue before taking him to the vet and they most likely won't since it's not bothering him and not infected. Hoping preventing him and Rory from licking it with the surgical suit will help."
dogs,fcqrfx4,t3_eiipem,1577891044.0,"Foster dog has a rash, he's had it since we got him so I have no clue how long he's had it for before us. Vet says he's not worried because it's not infected and to just put hydrocortisone cream on it which I have been doing but it's not helping. I am limited in what the rescue will pay for, so I can't just keep bringing him back to the vet only to be told it's no big deal.  

He must lick it at night, and I've caught Rory licking it too (smh dogs are gross) so I bought him a post surgical suit and that should be coming in the next few days."
dogs,fcnwo3u,t3_ehqsww,1577819940.0,"Current Basenji owner. They are WICKED smart and can learn new things in like 5 repetitions. The issue is that they choose whether or not they want to listen to you, and if it's ""worth it"" for them. This is my favorite quote about their intelligence - 

""Are basenjis intelligent? Yes, but not in the way you might first think. If basenjis were high school students, they would not be the brainiacs who score high enough on their SATs to go to Harvard on a full scholarship. No, basenjis would be the hoodlums with the smarts to bypass security, break into the principal's office, steal a copy of the test, and sell it for cigarette money."" ~ Robin Simmons



They are sighthounds, so I would never trust mine 100 percent off leash because if they see a rabbit they are off like the wind. Nothing scares them, so they will run straight into traffic after that bunny. 

If off leash is important to you, I would highly recommend looking into some of the other suggestions given to you here!"
dogs,fch2u4t,t3_eh8xln,1577646776.0,"If it were me, i'd probably completely dog proof a bathroom or the kitchen (no chemicals or food ANYWHERE and child lock the cabinets...) And leave her a blanket and a  kong"
dogs,fcfoja5,t1_fcf1rlq,1577632282.0,"Basenjis can't bark but they can sound like satanic goat banshee wails. They can also let out a singular barklike sound if they really want.

dogs,fcfo0fc,t3_eh6aoh,1577632106.0,"We had our first terrible dog park experience and we weren't even in the park!!!

I take Rory maybbeeee once a month to the dog park, usually a weekday around noon time and it's always either just us (I love this - I get to train Rory in offleash distracting environment) or a few other mild mannered regular dogs. So I've actually never before today had a bad experience!! 

Well yesterday was 50F and sunny, plus a Saturday = recipe for disaster. Especially since most dogs have been cooped up all winter. We're meeting up with dog friends, so we head to the park. Big side seems to be getting in alot of fights but small side is empty, so small side we go. Our friends get there, we decide to go on a walk instead. 

On our walk around the outside of park, we witness: a dog fly 100 yards from the parking lot with no owner in sight, manage to make it INSIDE the double gated park, and immediately start fighting with a dog over a ball. People are shouting and trying to pull them apart. Owner finally makes it inside the park after like 5 minutes. Now the other dog gets into a fight with a different dog over God knows what. Other owners are leaving by the truck load and yet these idiots remain in the park with their dogs who are fighting all the other dogs.
