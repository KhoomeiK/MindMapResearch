Think of it like blowing out a candle."
JamesBond,fezmebl,t1_feyqqur,1579458974.0,"I assumed it was because the KGB would have had a tight reign on all cossacks who were brought over during the Second World War and potentially kept a record of them, much like the Nazis did the Jews.

Zukovsky says, ‘I never met the man, but I heard he’s a Lienz Cossack’. It’s not that they know for sure, but just a rumour that Janus is a Cossack. Valentin probably heard it from someone he knew who heard it from their man who heard it from their roommate, etc. Even so, with their records on the Cossacks I don’t imagine it would be hard to confirm, if not precisely then well within reason."
JamesBond,fexm7h0,t1_fexfyq7,1579433238.0,"That one is more difficult. The term originally referred to the eyes but later came to mean ‘the senses’. I always thought of scaring, beating, or knocking ‘the living daylights’ out of someone as a fancy way of saying that you scared or beat them to death, that you did it so much you almost killed them. You petrified someone.

Fleming uses it in just this way.

Fleming’s short story, *The Living Daylights*, starts almost identically to the movie, with Bond taking position as a sniper in order to stop an assassin from killing the man he was sent to protect. 

When Bond realises the assassin is a female cellist, instead of firing a killing shot, Bond shoots the rifle she’s using. The man Bond is with is furious and says he hopes he gets fired for disobeying orders.

Bond replies, ‘. . . tell Head of Station not to worry. That girl won't do any more sniping. Probably lost her left hand. Certainly broke her nerve for that kind of work. Scared the living daylights out of her . . . ‘

JamesBond,feuxuxu,t1_feuns0e,1579391011.0,"That’s right, they don’t follow Alec’s orders, they follow Ourumov’s, and they’re in on it together. He’d have told his men what was happening just so they didn’t unknowingly put a wrench in the works. If he let them go like normal, they very well could and would have tried to disarm the bombs. For the plan to work as intended, the only person not in the know would had to have been Bond, otherwise, why capture Alec and let Ourumov execute him? Imagine if they got a shot off and killed them both, then the plan would be ruined. There was too much at stake to keep his men out of the loop.

The key here is that Trevelyan underestimated Bond. He didn’t think he’d escape. The plan was to have Ourumov capture him and then talk him into joining. ‘I was even thinking of asking you to join my little scheme . . . ‘ but then Bond escaped and Alec knew ‘you’d always be loyal to the mission, never to [your] friends’. 

If he couldn’t talk him into turning, he’d kill him. As it stands, though, Bond escaped and Alec was forced to let the tanks blow, otherwise he risked MI6 coming back to finish the job and potentially realising Trevelyan wasn’t dead.

No matter the outcome, Trevelyan needed to appear dead until he knew Bond was dead or on his side. It was a safety precaution to ensure the plan succeeded no matter the outcome. Bond was the only uncontrolled variable in the situation and an elaborate setup was the only way the plan could remain secure until Alec was in a position to reveal himself as Janus."
JamesBond,feuod4l,t1_feukq12,1579388433.0,"Ourumov shoots his man *after* killing Alec because he gets nervous and shoots the gas tanks Bond is hiding behind. 

You could easily load a blank bullet over your others, fire that one at Alec to sell the scene and the rest are real. If anything, killing the soldier in front of Bond would be an unintended side-effect that would help drive home the fact the bullet that killed Alec was real."
JamesBond,feuhnuc,t1_festi7u,1579386603.0,"The point of the fake execution was for Bond’s benefit to help Alec move forward and be able to defect to the USSR freely. 

From Bond’s angle, it would be hard to see any blood on the floor and his attention is considerably occupied with getting out of there. There’s no reason for Bond to scrutinise Trevelyan’s body after the shot.

The mines are kept in place *also* for Bond’s benefit. What Trevelyan wasn’t banking on was Bond changing the time from 6 to 3, something they hadn’t agreed upon. Bond did that of his own accord so there’s no way Alec would have known he needed to change the time. Even if he knew Bond might do, changing the time would have become suspicious and Bond would never get to see the plant explode. Bond’s expecting it to go in three. Six minutes gave Bond enough time to escape and for Alec to clear the area before the explosion. 3 cut it too close and Alec was injured. I don’t think he was still in the room when the explosion went off or he’d be dead. I think he’d made it out — just not far enough.

The plant is set to blow for Bond’s benefit. If it didn’t blow as scheduled, MI6 would have sent Bond or another double-oh to finish. At that point Alec couldn’t afford for MI6 to keep snooping around and ruining his plans. It also solidified the fact that Alec was dead; if the shot didn’t kill him, the explosion definitely did. When Bond reports this back home, Alec is clear to move about as needed without worrying about Bond or MI6 getting onto him."
JamesBond,fetuuoc,t3_eqhaqf,1579380255.0,"If you think about the history of the Lienz Cossack and the USSR, he probably started working on his revenge when he was young and joined the MI6 to use it to an advantage. I don’t think he just had the idea in ‘86.

He defected to the USSR as a British citizen (in spite of really being a Cossack and technically a citizen of the USSR anyway) so he could rot the British core from the inside by providing UK information to the Russians. He used MI6 until he didn’t need them anymore, then abandoned that life to move on with the next part of his plan, of which he had convinced Ourumov to be a part because it would make them both ‘more money than God.’ He more than likely used the info he’d gained as an MI6 operative to secure his defection into the USSR.

Trevelyan’s plan was ultimately the destruction of the USSR/Russia as well as Her Majesty’s Government. The Cossack’s were against the USSR and he carried that ideology with him after his parents’ death. His revenge against the UK came from the fact that the allies are the one’s who helped Stalin repatritise (?) the Cossacks into the USSR during WW2. It just so happened, ironically, that it was easier for him to operate in the USSR as an enemy against England, than the reverse. He would have turned against the USSR/Russia eventually but put England at the forefront because they caused the death of his parents. As for his plan against the USSR, he probably even provided info to the Brits in order to expedite the fall of the USSR as part of his plan until he found a way to get to the GoldenEye through Ourumov.

TL;DR - he was planning since before 1986, used his employment with MI6 to gather information he’d have used to secure his defection years later when he was ready to move on to the next part of his plan. He also probably provided info to the British to expedite the fall of the USSR until he found a way in through Ourumov and got his hands on the GoldenEye. He’d ultimately destroy Her Majesty’s Gov’t. before turning against the USSR. He went after the British because they were ultimately responsible for his parents’ death, and he was against the USSR because of the Cossack ideology against the USSR/Russia."

Unless, of course, NTTD happens to be a two-parter, which would permit another movie while still making this his last on a technicality. That could be as well. It would bookend his CR/QoS from the beginning, but I seriously doubt it."
JamesBond,fet3g0l,t3_eqhf19,1579371441.0,"I might be remembering it wrong but I always got the feeling Trevelyan was Russian/Ukrainian, possibly even German or Austrian, raised British because his parents were Cossacks but died and left Trevelyan orphaned. 

Cossacks were Russians/Ukrainians who were against the USSR and lived in Lienz (and other places in) Austria. 

During the Second World War, at the Yalta Conference, in an effort to get the Cossacks back into Russia for his own uses, Stalin claimed they were citizens of the USSR. Some of them were, but many were born in Germany and other places *outside* the USSR since before WW2. 

Long story short, the allies helped make this happen, and the repatriation of Cossacks began.

Being ex-KGB, Zukovsky would have been very familiar with Cossack families, their location, their names, etc, as the USSR kept a tight hold on them (if they didn’t kill them) once they were returned. Having access to those records, Zukovsky could search Trevelyan’s name or, assuming Trevelyan was a given name, follow the origin of Janus to his real name as the evidence would have been there to trace.

Ourumov wouldn’t know this because Trevelyan didn’t tell him for the very reason that’s revealed in the movie later. 

Minister Mishkin would have been one of the few capable of pulling records like that outside the KGB, but Ourumov unwittingly killed him before he could because of Mishkin’s accusation to him after talking to Bond.

As far as we know, Trevelyan could have simply told him he was MI6 who wished to defect with his help and had a plan that could make them rich. Clearly he wouldn’t give Ourumov any information where he could accidentally discover the truth and may not have known him as anything more than Alec or Janus.

TL;DR - Valentin has access to Cossacks considering USSR/Cossack relations from the past, Ourumov doesn’t have that kind of access, killed the only man he knew that did, and Alec would have never given him any information on himself whereby Ourumov could have accidentally stumbled across that info until the job was done."

I won’t pretend I’ve listened to all her music — I haven’t — but what I have heard doesn’t give me Bond vibes, even in a non-traditional way like Arctic Monkeys or Cornell or someone you wouldn’t readily identify with Bond. It’s her experimentalist approach that worries me. Standing apart is good, breathing fresh air is also good, but with something so steeped in tradition like Bond, go too far out, be too experimental, and you wind up in Eric Serra territory, where it might be liked by some (I particularly love the GoldenEye Overture), but largely looked away from because it doesn’t fit the mould people have come to fit Bond in. God only knows what Romer had planned, but him being ‘too experimental’, that just drives home the point.

I don’t want the same thing to happen to her. I want it to be successful. I think to do that, she’ll need to find a way to balance her out-of-the-box approach while still drawing within the lines that Bond has drawn.

What’s wrong with Shirley? Or Tina? Or Gladys? And what the hell is wrong with Goldfinger? It’s widely seen as the gold standard of Bond tunes. Blaring brass and ‘lung-busting’ vocals is exactly what I want to hear in a Bond theme, otherwise it’s just another song.

> and a BPM that barely troubles the double digits. 

Are Bond themes supposed to be rave tunes or something? Give me slower, sultry, and sexy themes with a classical arrangement any day over Darude, Sandstorm.

> Never mind that the best Bond themes – 'Nobody Does It Better', 'A View To A Kill', 'You Only Live Twice' – sound absolutely nothing like 'Goldfinger'. The Bond theme apparently must be turgidly slow and howled out at hurricane force. 

TIL Nobody Does It Better is unquestionably a part of everyone’s best Bond songs and Goldfinger, because it’s nothing like NDIB or VtaK, is implicitly one of the worst. VtaK is great, but I don’t listen to it and go, now THAT’s a Bond song. YOLT is very reminiscent of Goldfinger in many ways and is a fantastic tune, same as TWINE, Skyfall, Thunderball, TLD, Surrender by KD Lang, GoldenEye, all of which follow in Goldfinger’s footsteps. 

You Know My Name is an exception to this, but still had a killer vocal by Cornell that makes it one of the best.

I don’t know what Eilish and her brother have planned, but it will need something very special if it’s not going to follow with tradition. At the same time, she will need to let go of her genre to make it truly special. I say this because she currently has a female-driven fan base, with many girls her age that follow. If she wants to appeal to anyone actually going to see a Bond film, it will need to transcend her boundaries.

She has the voice, that much is undeniable. 

I’m just not sure about the rest.

At the rate this movie’s going, with Fukunaga and Zimmer in place, I wouldn’t be surprised if Eilish is replaced before April whether it’s any good or not.

TL;DR - Goldfinger is one of the best songs, in spite of what this article says; I also disagree with what they think is ‘best’ for Bond. I hope Eilish can pull it off, but it will need to be out of her norm; at this rate, she’ll probably be replaced before April anyway."

Being the Bond snob I am, I left work and came directly to my home office and poured over my Fleming books to try and prove you wrong, but ultimately failed to find anything at all on Fleming’s conception for Bond’s ancestry.

I have always heard, and anything I’ve ever read, says that he became taken with Connery and changed Bond’s background because of it. This, of course, has never been quoted by Fleming, and I can find no legitimate sources for it online.

Now that I think of it, Fleming is from Scott’s blood, so it just as well could have been — and apparently is more-so the case — that he had taken that bit from his own life just as well as he could have Connery’s."
JamesBond,fdqui81,t1_fdqsmym,1578675117.0,He thought Dr No was ‘simply dreadful’. He didn’t warm to Connery until FRWL/GF-ish when he wrote OHMSS and ~~gave Bond the ancestry as a nod to Connery~~.

That being said, it would have made him a considerable amount of money, so while he may have hated the film, and the Bond who played in it, he’d have been conflicted at best.

JamesBond,fdgrhre,t3_el2ihk,1578406434.0,"To be fair, Bond could have not driven a DB5 in this one also. Not to say that having it in the film is underwhelming itself or bad, but it’s become a staple in the Craig era and it doesn’t need to be. I like my DB5 to be special and to show up on occasion, sprinkled in with all the *other* cars he drives, whereas Craig drives the DB5 almost exclusively, and it has featured in all but one of his films.

Yes, Corgi could have and should have done something else, but so could Bond. In fact, they did, but Corgi took advantage of the fact that the DB5 featured and possibly took the easy way out. They’ve been selling the model for ages. If all they needed was to change the plate number, I’m sure that’s far more affordable for them to do than cast a completely new vehicle and start from scratch. 

It could also be that Bond only drives the two classics, while others drive the newer models and Corgi wanted to stick with strictly Bond-driven ones. Who knows?"
