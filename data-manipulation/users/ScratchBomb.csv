ADHD,ffc8hxx,t1_ffbv4tr,1579793960.0,"""Undiagnosed ADHD is was like having the impostor syndrome for everything in life, walking around feeling stupid but knowing you are smart in some ways too.""

Sorry, I don't know how to format on mobile, but this is exactly how I've been feeling. I haven't read a more apt description. It's fucking exhausting trying to manage the mental gymnastics it takes to convince myself otherwise. I'm having a really hard time today and can't bring myself to do anything work related. It all feels so overwhelming. I'm not diagnosed with ADHD, but one clue lead to another, and I've come to find I can relate to most, if not all of the symptoms. I'm currently working on getting a proper diagnosis, and I hope that whatever the issue is, I find the right solution."

They are hard to handle at times but are also really fun and the most precious things in my life. But I can't imagine dealing with their BS if I didn't want them in the first place. Too many people are uneducated about sex, birth control, and the actual responsibilities that come with raising a kid. Most people I know had them by accident. And although they say they love their kids, their approach and tactics as parents seem questionable at best. But I do know some people that, once they got on their feet and took responsibility, turned out to be great parents."

I'm a professional, but not a expert.  I do like to flex the knowledge I do have when I feel comfortable and I am strong-willed when sharing my opinions.  I also try to throttle myself and realize that it's just an opinion I could always be wrong.  This does give me a sense of superiority sometimes, something I also try to throttle and control.  Essentially, your post made me self-reflect.  And though I admit that there is much I don't know, I try to also not use it as a disclaimer for shitty and arrogant behavior.  It's a constant battle to balance myself, be self-aware, and be confident with what I do know and the opinions that I have, while practicing humility and still listening.  It's exhausting."

Just don't take your baby out of your assigned room.  I had my first kid in a really nice hospital in Colorado, really chill, and I would go on a walk around L&D with him while mom slept.  I tried that at Candler and they all went into panic mode.  I guess people tend to steal babies there...

savannah,fcv3hr4,t1_fcv0a8i,1577993880.0,"Agree with Op, here.  There are only a few places out of that zone you'd want to visit.  Eastward, you can extend out to Broad street.  Westward, you can extend out to MLK, but be wary at night.  Both MLK and Broad can be sketchy, but a ton or tourists still frequent those areas.  There are actually some good spots like the distillery, the grey, and more.  Chatham crescent is fine, but there isn't much to do there.  On the plus side, you will be near the Starland District which has some good, local spots: Starland Yard, Back in the Day Bakery, The Vault, Bull Street Taco, Foxy Loxy.    


If you want to wander and stroll around town, stay within that zone Op mentioned.  If you go outside of it, have a plan don't wander too much."

TwoXChromosomes,fcp51ct,t3_ei9axq,1577850687.0,"I'm really sorry. Those are some awful things to go through. Though I can't say my year was that awful, I have been going through an identity crisis that has made me mentally and emotionally turbulent for the past couple of years. If there is some good to it, I believe I'm self reflecting more which is why I feel that way. However I'm not sure if it's actually helping. Your post inspired me to write, albeit I'm writing for my own selfish reasons. I think about killing myself often. I don't ever want to leave my wife and kids, but sometimes I just can't help but feel the weight of it all. The thought is somewhat seductive. I can't imagine what your husband was going through either. I can't even begin to fathom the emotional chaos taking place in your life right now. Writing that, it may seem like I'm somewhat defending him. I'm not. It's just something I'm dealing with in my life that's giving me perspective. The idea of it is so narcissistic, but not in a regular way. I can get so caught up in my depression, my guilt, my wants, my feelings, that I don't even realize that other people are dealing with shit too. Now with that said, I stand by the principal that you should be considerate to everyone because they are fighting a battle you know nothing about. It's a terrible thing. It leaves me empty and I want to fix it. I'm reading books, I'm self reflecting, I'm trying my best to change for the better because I diserve it. The world deserves it. My wife and kids deserve it. I'm trying my fucking best. I just want to be a good father, a good husband, and good at whatever I set my mind to. It's that last part of the puzzle that keeps me up. I don't know who I am and I don't know what I want. Ever. I let other people indirectly influence my decisions that in hardly conscious of it. I don't stand by anything because I'm afraid. I'm afraid of nothing. To me it feels massive, but in the grand scheme of things, it's miniscule. My wife is supportive and I couldn't be more grateful. I love her with all my heart and I couldn't do this without her. I'm a fucking loser.  

Thanks for the opportunity to rant, Op. I hope you get through this. I'm rooting for you and your son. As a fatherless man myself, I needed a ton of support I never got. I hope he does well. Let him become in tuned with his emotions. And for you. I hope you make it. Your son needs you and this world needs you. You are loved and we want you here. 

Happy new year"
