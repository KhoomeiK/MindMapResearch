AskReddit,fe4ut7i,t3_ennslu,1578863005.0,"A job that seems 100% secure is never 100% secure.  It's ok to stay at a company for a long time if you want but always remember you are replaceable and the unexpected can happen.  

As someone who was laid off last year after being with a company for 10 years and thinking my position was solid, always make sure you are ""up-skilling"" yourself as the years pass.  If your job has remained the same in terms of technology/processes for more than 4-5 years it is worth looking into certs/classes for new technology/processes that different companies are using.   My old company used outdated methodologies/technology and by the time I was laid off I couldn't get a job in the same field because of this.  

So at least once year I would suggest you look at available jobs in your field at least once a year to see what their education/requirements are.  Even if you never apply for the jobs it would give you a good idea of what you need to keep current on in terms of education/certs."
aww,fe4ilz3,t1_fe47rup,1578859711.0,"It's just like an adoption of a minor, he became my legal father in the eyes of the law.  Based on that my birth certificate would need to be updated with his name since it is a legal document listing my ""father"".  

As for future generations it shouldn't really affect them.  The only future generations are my now legal nieces and nephews.  I myself have no kids, I'm single, I'm in the later half of my 30's, and have no plans on having kids.  I'm far more happy being an aunt than being a mom.  

If I did have kids it would be more of a benefit to them than not since legally they would be connected to my dad than if the adoption hadn't happened.  In the eyes of the law they would be considered grandkids instead of step-grandkids."
aww,fe4240j,t1_fe2uz0e,1578855023.0,"I'm not OP but I asked my Dad to adopt me when I was 34 and it was made official when I was 35.  While I've considered him my Dad since I was a teenager making it official really did affect me emotionally, and it seems to have affected him as well.  We haven't really talked about why because he is a super stoic personality but just knowing that we both agreed to the adoption really makes you feel genuinely accepted. What I mean by that is he seems to really appreciate that I made the choice to make it official.  He wasn't legally my dad because I have his genes, he was legally my dad because I made the choice to ask him to be.  

Not only that, but as someone who dealt with the mental aftermath of a bio-father who said he wanted to be in my life/loved me but never made the effort, having my Dad say yes to being my legal Dad was a huge part of the healing process for me.  When I originally asked him I didn't think it would make that much of a difference because I already considered him my Dad but as soon as I saw his name on my birth certificate it like a festering wound finally healed."

MovieDetails,fcqv5nm,t1_fcoywx1,1577892692.0,"Im an ID4 super fan and can explain the virus. 

Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich somewhat explained the virus and if you combine that info with info from the books (Silent Zone and War in the Desert) there is a pretty good explanation on how the virus worked and why it would work.  

The basic info... 

- The ships communication and energy system are one in the same.   So not only does that system relay communications but energy is recycled between the ships to keep them going.  That is why the ship crashed in Rosewell... because something happened to its partner ship (I think it crashed in the ocean) and it could no longer fly.   

- All communication is done through binary.  we see this when David prints out the signal in the movie.  Everything is in binary.  

- Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich have come out and said that the virus flipped the binary on its head changing the 1's to 0's and the 0's to 1's.  

How this all comes together to make the virus work...

- David uploads the virus and it flips the binary on its head.  However the Aliens are advanced enough to fix this pretty quickly, hence why the ships didnt crash from the virus alone. 

- Since the energy system and the communication system are the same that means they had to divert energy away from something to help fix the issue and that one thing was the shields.  Just like in Star Trek when they start loosing energy the first thing that goes down is the shields.  

- both the virus and the fix took time to filter down to the other ships.  we see this when President Whitmore has to fire two missiles to get through the shield.  This is also why the shields will only be down for a ""few minutes"". 

And thats basically it.  The virus did nothing but reduce the overall output of energy to all the ships due to that energy being diverted to fixing the virus that was just uploaded.  This brought down the shields just long enough for the humans to figure out their weak point.    Also, they knew how to ""connect"" to the ship from the decades spent on the crashed ship.  This can be found in ""Silent Zone"".

whitepeoplegifs,fc7acnq,t1_fc6npkv,1577501748.0,"because ""E1 and up GUARANTEED!"".  

What that means is this.  An E1 is the lowest enlisted rank in the military and usually these folks are 18 or 19. As of right now they make $1,554.00 a month before taxes.   

Due to being in the military the dealerships know that if they finance a car to a young person in the military, and if that person doesn't pay, its super easy to garnish the wages and recoup some of that money.  This also causes them to offer insane interest rates to people who have no to little credit history, but a guaranteed job/paycheck for 4 years minimum, because they can.  

It is so common that every single base in the US is guaranteed to have a car lot within a few miles offering guaranteed financing to E-1's and up.   On top of that, at every place I was stationed, you went to a class when you arrived saying to stay away from places like that.  Regardless of all the warnings there was always a few people who got themselves in trouble at places like that.  Hell, I've heard of interest rates as high as 100% after everything was factored in."
