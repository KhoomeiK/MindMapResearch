ExpectationVsReality,ffh35kq,t1_ffgi03p,1579921841.0,You're missing arc lamps which need to be replaced 1-3 months if you really milk them and range from sub $200 bux all the way up to a 5-8 stacks like a water cooled UXW-15KD that usually go in a oldschool 15/70 IMAX...Sadly they're an endangered species but can you imagine buying a car every month because you have four hungry 2 ton behemoths to feed.
HumansBeingBros,ffgzkll,t1_ffgjv0j,1579919132.0,Keyed alike fleet keys... Very easy.

WTF,ffbocya,t1_ffbnd0b,1579775546.0,All I was trying to convey is if we're specifically talking about co2 asphyxiating from it sucks ass the whole time up until you lose consciousness while the alternatives are just like light switches. If there's a silver lining it's that co2 does give you a chance once you take notice to get to higher ground before it's lights out.
DnD,ffbiwc9,t3_esknzm,1579767399.0,"I don't play DnD but dice like this make me wonder if anyone has ran this structure into a sim to calculate its CG? I'd hate to get screwed on my roll because you want to use your wanky loaded die and the material that makes up the extruded 20, 18, 16, offset the CG."
Tinder,ffbgfer,t1_ffazr9u,1579764164.0,Yea well a cupcake is just a muffin
mildlyinteresting,ffbeqat,t1_ffafboi,1579762111.0,Ngl my local hospital has an awesome cafeteria only downside is the sugar free drinks but the food variety daily is great... Some days I ponder stopping in to get a bite rather than fast food.
WTF,ffaybe5,t1_ffar12r,1579747313.0,"You should be able to see it coming or rather have a bodily reaction to high co2 levels such as labored breathing. It's other gases that are more scarey as we dont have a response to them, helium is a good example as people have accidents not realizing that sucking a balloon consecutively is not breathing."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fecokru,t1_fecnamq,1578979209.0,"Well let's pretend they had a head on their shoulders... Cancel your cards with what? a cellphone you don't have, apps you can't access and a 1800# you cant remember? They'll be able to use your card before you're able to take the appropriate actions but you'll get your money back after 45min on the phone with the branch."

awfuleverything,fe71eub,t1_fe6xt8o,1578908745.0,"It's one of those things you have to have personal experience with in order to understand and buy into, You can read all about it and look at examples but if you can't relate in any capacity it doesn't click. Kinda like explaining ""déjà vu"" to someone who has nothing to relate it to, you can tell them all about it but it's not going to click."
