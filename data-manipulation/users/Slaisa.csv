UnexpectedlyWholesome,ffg0s8m,t1_fffysef,1579895983.0," the best exercises to get started are Push ups, pull ups and squats regardless of your expertise. These are still in my warm up sessions. 

As you become familiar with things and gain experience you can specialize but for now id suggest simplifying the idea of a work out, Getting used to it and having it positively affect you.

Maybe you can't do 3 sets of 15 . Fuck it, do as many as you can each set. If you don't feel like working out, bang out 5 push ups before deciding not to work out that day.

Don't fall for the supplement trap that the pop fitness industry tries to sell. Your nutrition that comes from your daily diet should always be your top priority. Those powders and pills are supplements. 

Finally, consistency. You have to have consistency, the longer the better. If you fall off the routine because of issues then don't beat yourself about it, move on, and get back to doing push ups, pull ups and squats. 

I'd wish you good luck but I don't believe in luck when it comes to physical transformations only reward proportionate to effort."

4) if you Want to gain muscle the you have to put in the hours at the gym

5) if you Want to look like that guy in the Pic you have to do both 3&4 for years. It's not easy but it's worth it. 

6) the best time to start is now."
