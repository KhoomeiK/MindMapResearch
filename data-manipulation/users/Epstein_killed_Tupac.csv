MaddenUltimateTeam,ffvsfn3,t1_ffvpky6,1580271938.0,Yeah low key kinda a dick move OP. Dudes probably feels even worse now.
Mavericks,ffvpe5p,t3_evgvvv,1580269627.0,Imagine if he was actually really athletic.
motivation,ffvncia,t3_ev4idf,1580268197.0,How tf did that guy on the motorcycle fuck that up he had to have heard the other bike speeding up from behind those shits are loud af.
MaddenUltimateTeam,ffvn8gy,t3_evcmnc,1580268120.0,If you go out with me I’ll give you 100k coins in madden.
nba,ffvm3tb,t1_ffvlfsc,1580267347.0,How did he lose his grandmothers dumbass.
nba,ffvjl8x,t1_ffvjgks,1580265644.0,That’s sad.
nba,ffvjebe,t1_ffvir5s,1580265514.0,You’re wildly unhelpful.
nba,ffvhvkg,t3_evegh8,1580264486.0,What does he mean he lost 2 grandmothers?
Mavericks,ffu8mel,t1_ffssuqm,1580236784.0,"Yeah I feel that it’s alright to complain if you’re not
happy but I don’t know how bad they would have to fuck up for me to switch my loyalty probably like really really badly."
Mavericks,ffsshac,t1_ffsqzr1,1580190827.0,I don’t see any issue with blind loyalty when it comes to sports. Dallas is my city and I will be blindly loyal to all of its teams until I die.
Mavericks,ffssffk,t3_euydrd,1580190774.0,As a big fan of mostly unsuccessful Tony Romo I don’t get how people can get so bitter over losses. I watched Tony lose over and over and I always loved what he did for the city regardless and respected him as an amazing QB especially considering he went undrafted. Let’s not get spoiled just because we have some hope on our team. If you’re gonna get mad at the Mavs for losing some games I don’t know how you can even look at the cowboys.
Mavericks,ffrxzsr,t1_ffrsjer,1580168458.0,You see WCS this is what we in the biz like to call... A roll and pick.
nba,ffrx0t6,t1_ffqzx9d,1580167800.0,"He said something along the lines of “thats not the only rotator that tore up Kobe.” Then his second comment he deleted said “What? Too soon? Fuck your feelings.”
And once again his user is 99thpercentile and I will not let that be forgotten just cause he thinks he can delete his comment."
Mavericks,ffrcl7v,t1_ffrb8hd,1580155271.0,He said “assuming.”
modernwarfare,ffra79j,t1_ffra5id,1580153811.0,Yeah I’m autistic good one
modernwarfare,ffr729c,t1_ffr5sua,1580151860.0,Ok
modernwarfare,ffr2kec,t1_ffr2gw3,1580149070.0,Ok cool
modernwarfare,ffr2f2g,t1_ffr2a00,1580148977.0,That’s alright.
modernwarfare,ffr1yrp,t1_ffr1vbu,1580148691.0,If you can’t figure out why those two I think you’re pretty fucking stupid. Take a wild guess. And nope don’t think that was his goal he even said he jokes about everything so it was meant as a joke.
modernwarfare,ffr1o1e,t1_ffr1mcf,1580148504.0,Alright man
modernwarfare,ffr1kip,t1_ffr1i4c,1580148444.0,I’m not making fun of Tupac already said that to someone else. And nah you go fuck yourself I’m good.
modernwarfare,ffr1emy,t1_ffr1d97,1580148340.0,How am I supposed to know which kids die everyday?
modernwarfare,ffr1d2x,t1_ffr13oz,1580148312.0,Ok dude
modernwarfare,ffr1bbw,t1_ffr0xdp,1580148281.0,And I don’t joke about those people. Especially when 2 of them are 13 years old and it happened yesterday.
modernwarfare,ffr18my,t1_ffr0g1n,1580148233.0,Yeah no shit dumbass. Two 13 year old girls just died maybe have some fucking respect.
modernwarfare,ffr12yf,t1_ffr0ylp,1580148132.0,The username is meant to remind people of those two individual deaths I’m not trying to make fun of Pac.
modernwarfare,ffr08bt,t1_ffqz5fc,1580147596.0,I knew there’d be a fucking moron didn’t think it’d be the only comment though. You’re not funny and you should go fuck yourself.
aww,ffqzer8,t1_ffqur2v,1580147074.0,That’s what I was wondering. For sure can’t get that close to a polar bear.
nba,ffqyr5k,t1_ffqxz98,1580146657.0,"Bro. Go. Fuck. Yourself.
Delete this comment too you fucking pussy
99thpercentile is his user if he deletes this shit."
nba,ffqy7s5,t3_euqu88,1580146314.0,That’s what TMZ does. Calls people to get their initial reaction no matter what. Like when they called Steve-O and told him Ryan Dunn died in a car accident before Steve-O had even woken up for the day.
nba,ffqxyta,t1_ffqxnlt,1580146158.0,Go fuck yourself
NBA2k,ffqxos5,t1_ffqxmvp,1580145983.0,Nice.

modernwarfare,ffqtzj1,t1_ffqm9p7,1580143598.0,That’s not the Kar.
modernwarfare,ffqtxsf,t1_ffqk7ow,1580143567.0,Anyone who thinks that’s the Kar is fucking blind.
Mavericks,ffnv2jh,t3_eubf1m,1580071236.0,I wanna be that Uber driver.
Mavericks,ffnsc2s,t3_eubl0d,1580070123.0,I wonder how Lebron must feel.
Mavericks,ffnrrew,t3_eubr1m,1580069891.0,I didn’t know until this post holy shit.
MaddenUltimateTeam,ffnr6av,t1_ffnmnea,1580069656.0,Yeah he’s like “I ain’t blocking shit figure it out on your own.”
nba,ffkpfqh,t3_eu1rcb,1580026602.0,I think Jimmy Hxghroller did a video on this topic a while ago with his own calculations shits nuts
motivation,ffkoqif,t3_etzvme,1580026270.0,Nice message. Too bad it’s coming from that guy.
Mavericks,ffkoc5y,t3_eu3yyq,1580026077.0,I don’t think it’s just this team. No fan base likes to lose.

MaddenUltimateTeam,ffkndhf,t3_etsnon,1580025612.0,So you’re telling me... legends are in the legends fantasy packs?
Mavericks,ffkn96q,t1_ffjlz8l,1580025554.0,When I saw they were talking about keeping him and Jalen Brunson away from trade offers I was like yeeeaaaahhhh maybe just keep Jalen.
motivation,ffkms8e,t3_ets9rf,1580025332.0,I need to start putting posts like these in a file on my laptop or some shit.

Mavericks,ffhjk1w,t1_ffhgvjm,1579938169.0,Just saying we beat the Bucks on a 10 game win streak without Luka that should say something.
nba,ffhjd8y,t1_ffhj4x2,1579937913.0,"30 isn’t that much he probably did more than 30, regardless you don’t understand the point I’m making."

nba,ffhg9lv,t1_ffhftmj,1579933958.0,I’m also not sure of their wingspans I could see Zion just having a ridiculous reach which adds to the craziness.
Mavericks,ffhg7be,t1_ffhf8tk,1579933884.0,Comparing your replies to OP when really only OP should care about what I said. I didn’t even think I was being rude to him I’m just blunt sometimes I guess other people don’t like that. OP was able to move on a lot quicker than you and it’s their post I commented on.
modernwarfare,ffhet6x,t1_ffhegsb,1579932281.0,First thing you do in every game of infected is find a buddy and get ready to shoot your buddy.
nba,ffhemuj,t1_ffhee8x,1579932088.0,Yeah just looks more insane cause it’s him. Zach Lavine can jump higher than him but it doesn’t look like it cause Zion is so much bigger.
askscience,ffhdqcz,t1_ffhdnag,1579931114.0,Yeah that makes sense that’s interesting. And on another note I’m getting downvoted for explaining my own personal experience lmao what’s with people on Reddit.
nba,ffhcn8x,t1_ffh2dbf,1579930002.0,Pretty sure his vertical isn’t actually that insane but he’s so big he makes it look like it’s just ridiculous.
askscience,ffhcicc,t1_ffhcfse,1579929867.0,I mean I got some antibiotics or something but I never went to a hospital or anything just was home sick for a little literally exactly like a regular flu.
askscience,ffhb82v,t1_ffh55os,1579928600.0,Swine Flu wasn’t always that bad though right? I got it in Texas and it didn’t seem any worse than a regular flu and I got over it in a week or 2.
Minecraft,ffh8xxc,t1_ffh8vwz,1579926524.0,God bless you. I would’ve gone my entire life without knowing if it wasn’t for you. Thank you.
Minecraft,ffh8hsa,t1_ffgxgp5,1579926136.0,Lmao let me know when you figure out dirt loser.
MaddenUltimateTeam,ffft33z,t3_etcr5r,1579891199.0,Well the announcers also call a 4th quarter touchdown drive “the first drive of the game.”
Mavericks,fffrc2g,t1_fffqdqn,1579890113.0,"It’s not a big deal, OP doesn’t even seem to mind that much but for some reason you do even though you have no stake in this discussion."

Mavericks,ffeihjx,t1_ffeifwl,1579849358.0,I didn’t think you lied. Just that you mislead everyone with the title whether or not it was an accident.
Mavericks,ffei8zf,t1_ffebo4l,1579849081.0,Yeah if you just look at the starters from both sides it’s crazily one sided.
Mavericks,ffei5lb,t1_ffei41d,1579848970.0,"Wasn’t rude just a suggestion. If you thought it was rude it’s cause of how you perceived it, not my fault."
Mavericks,ffeh5fz,t3_et6ek4,1579847817.0,He didn’t say shit about Dame in the clip maybe post a clip of him actually saying something about Dame or don’t mention it in the title.

Mavericks,ffb6qot,t1_ff9qda3,1579753288.0,A historic scoring season on even more historically bad shooting. 1/17 from 3 and that’s not the first time he’s gone 1/17. He has 4 of the 5 lowest shooting percentages ever recorded on 15+ attempts. Harden fucking sucks and you’ll never see Luka shoot that bad in his entire career I guarantee.
Mavericks,ffaj5pb,t1_ffagtgo,1579737020.0,Yup

AskReddit,ff8zk4t,t3_es59kl,1579700977.0,I was under the impression all women just grew babies in their stomach and had to painfully push them out no matter what. Like even if you locked yourself in isolation for your entire life one day you would grow a baby and give birth.
nba,ff8w4uj,t1_ff8e3pw,1579698066.0,Yo wtf guys this is public any team can read this.
