There was tons of debate with her and her mains always argued that she was made harder to use as justification to keep her 60 hp/s. The guy is by no means wrong, Brig absolutely a more thoughtful hero now. Especially because she doesn't have 3-3 to play alongside. She's close, but still needs some tweaks. It's almost like some weird euphoria how people don't realize that something OP goes beyond skill, then the thing comes down from being OP into something taking decisions and forethought to make good things happen, and poof, the skill conversation suddenly pops up again.

It was *literally* unstoppable at demolishing the back line, and it did enough damage to 100-0 every tank in the game. I'm not going to use something busted as a counter argument for something else busted. Where's the sense in that? Moth was the same thing, moth mercy made anything viable because she could, well, literally bring them back to life (sustaiiiin). I refuse to use busted as an argument against busted. 

Dive was overwatch's greatest point thus far, and it wasn't defined by anyone. All the heroes in dive had a role, they all mattered, and the game was the best it ever was. Gonna sit here and tell me there'd be no dive without Winston and dva? 

I'll be honest, I don't care about ladder balance <3500. Those players are not playing Overwatch, they're playing a bastardized version like street ball. Take what you will, that's my 2 cents.

Power creep is such an overblown concept, I've hated it from the moment this subreddit latched onto it as the flavor of the month buzzword. It's a totally meaningless term, because balance is a relative concept, not an absolute one."
Competitiveoverwatch,fgrwtc5,t1_fgrw7p7,1581060637.0,"Brig is fine when she can toss a 75 *armor* over heal from across the map, with no aim or possibility of missing onto a tracer that's diving the enemy back line? Really? That's the explicit reason why she was nerfed, and that's why the change is the way it is. 

I really tried to hear this comment out, but I just can't do it. It's too incoherent.

I'll take a snippet that I think gets at the point of what you're trying to say:

> Damage being so high and TTK being so low directly strains what a Support or Tank can actually do.  

Can you argue for me, why exactly this a bad thing? 

Especially when nearly 4 years of overwatch has shown, time and time again, that DPS is one of the most irrelevant classes in this game? 

I've always been a tank main. I will never, ever, pretend that tanks and heals haven't been the most impactful and influential roles in this game. OG triple tank and 3-3 showed what tanks and healers can do, without DPS.

Tanks aren't going to suddenly not have the best ults in the game. That's a fact. Healers aren't going to suddenly stop enabling tanks and countering DPS ults. That's a fact. Also, tanks and healers as well as dps are all forced into a 2-2-2 now, that's also a fact, and you're going to see the game evolve because of this. Whether you like it or not isn't certain, but an evolution of the game's form around the 2-2-2 skeleton is certain. It's inevitable. 

DPS killing things is part of the fucking game, I hate to say get over it.. but, get over it. DPS have been asscheeks for 2 years, my dude. Tanks have been able to kill one another along side healers (think about this.. all this energy invested into saying how healers are subpar to DPS when the reality is tanks have been killing one another *whilst* being healed for this entire time. Really think about that and what's wrong with it) for years. Tanks have never even needed DPS to kill other tanks and healers. DPS have always been some of the most dangerous, high risk, and punishable picks in the game. They've always been that way. That's just the nature of the game, the squishies who have to put themselves on the line are always going to be the most at risk and the least performing in the risk:reward ratio. Even in recent incarnations of the game, with strong dps heroes, players have continued to gravitate towards tanky comps, because tanks can still dish great damage while simply being safer heroes. They have higher HP pools, they're safer. They don't die as easily, and therefore they lower the stakes of every interaction. 

I just can't do it with this long winded mental-gymnastics. You can sit here and talk pretty to me *all day* about why tanks and healers have it so bad, but it's all much ado about nothing, it's make believe. It wasnt reflected in 3-3. Sustain, not damage, literally the inverse of damage actually, has driven this game for a long time. 

There's competitive games out there where people die in one shot to the head from any gun, and that game has stood the test of time as the greatest esport ever. I don't even need to say it's name, and I don't even like that particular game. But I respect the hell out of it. 

Take away from all this— higher damage and less heal/health fun means higher stakes in every shot fired, every action taken. It means the best shot and the best aim, the best decisions mean more. It means smarts and mechanics for tanks and healers go up, and it means spectator value goes up. Skill goes up across the board when blanket solutions like (dump a shit load of heals into big-bodies with big HP) becomes less viable. Every last shield, every last healer ability, every tiny decision and reaction time becomes more and more valuable when things die faster and choices carry more consequence. 

I welcome that."

Competitiveoverwatch,fgrvoju,t1_fgrvhoj,1581059334.0,"No, he's poorly designed because *too* much of his value is back loaded into his ultimate. He's an ult bot, and he falls into a similar rut as doomfist.

Doomfist is a cc+delete bot, that's where *all* of his value is, so it kind of either works or doesn't. Works and it deletes people, doesn't work and it he doesn't offer much else. Genji has a similar problem. If his ult shreds, then he's not only viable, but has to be OP as well. His ult works by quickly moving in, using huge burst damage, then quickly moving away to the next target. That's OP in my book. Same reason why doomfist CC lock deletion is OP. 

Put another way, genji being viable and being OP are tied together, because his ult is what makes him viable, but his ult has to be OP (at least flirting dangerously with being OP) in order to be viable. He has to go in and kill people with it. Just has to. If he can't do that, he's just a gimped version of literally any other dps. Doom is similar, he has to do his stun lock+delete spiel in order to be viable, but what makes him viable is also what makes him OP."

Careful now, Overwatch is a game that is ultimately based on things dying, what things die, and when they die. The whole concept of winnable comes from getting picks. The game is played around kills. Do not fear the idea of damage trumping heals on paper, this is a dangerous line of thought. A line of thought that is clearly emotionally charged, for you. 

Healing should always take a backseat, right now they're being put in the back seat again. They can balance later."

Competitiveoverwatch,fgrtrxe,t1_fgrf28n,1581057290.0,"She's still the same hero, she's just in the realm of balanced now. She isn't an outer-space, black hole, meta-warping type of busted anymore. Post-mass rez Mercy had a lot of the same thought-processes behind her and she still needed nerfs anyway. People cried *so* hard about Mercy mains being abused. I read these comments and think a similar thing is happening, people are looking at an iteration of a character that is, at the least, actually able to be balanced. With mass rez, it wasn't possible to balance. No matter what, it would force a style of play no matter what, so long as it existed.  Mass rez went away, and the devs were finally able to balance her. The same thing recently happened with the OG 3-3 incarnation of Brigette, with 3-3 now being impossible to run, she has come back down to the realm of balance and people are naturally going to confuse ""balanced"" with ""able to be balanced"".

Whatever you attribute to Brig as skill now, is likely actually due to the new limitations put on her by 3-3 going away. Just because she has come down a peg doesn't mean she's balanced. 75 armor overheal on a tracer with no chance of missing or risk involved in making such a thing happen, isn't okay, so that needs to be addressed. And I'm glad that this information is, supposedly, coming straight from pro scrims."
