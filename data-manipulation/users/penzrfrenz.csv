I shot a noctilux for years that I got used for 2k.  Once it got up to 6k in value I was like, I am hard as hell on my gear, what the fuck am I doing banging this around.  Sold it and bought the voightlander.

Edit: also shot 35mm 1.4 and 75mm 1.4 wide open all the time.  It's just a particular style.  I'm not sure it is practical for the world of paparazzi, but it's a very workable way of doing things.

BipolarSOs,fgpbsy6,t3_ezse8m,1581001569.0,"So, remember that a lot of the stories here have the phrases ""they refuse to take their meds"" or ""none of their meds work.""

I was a shitshow until I was properly medicated, and it tore my marriage apart.

However, I am really optimistic that I can be a happy, healthy partner.  But, I mean, I'm also crazy, so I would think that.  ;)

Bipolar people often have something really special about them.  A creativity and an energy.  That doesn't get killed with meds.  This isn't well documented, but this is why a lot of psychiatrists like bipolar folks as we are often exceptional individuals. (I follow most all the mental health subreddits, and the art on the bipolar subreddits is truly, truly exceptional.  And not just for ""mentally ill"" people, but in general.  I'm a writer, photographer, and musician.  I know mad successful business people.  Etc.)

That makes us really neat to be with.  It's certainly part of why my marriage lasted for 2 decades despite being unmedicated.  

I wish I could point at some data for you about this, so it didn't sound like I was fluffing my ego quite so much.  :). Don't get me wrong, it can be a horrible disease, and requires active management.

Also would be a red flag for me if someone told me to stop being friends with my (soon to be) ex-wife.  She's a wonderful person and the mother of my child, and we share a large circle of friends who love us both.  Even if we didn't have a kid, she would be a valued part of my life, and me of hers. 

I'm an adult and I have time to invest in people I care about and are friends with.  Just because our marriage is ending doesn't mean that we can't value the other person for who they are.

I don't put her on a pedestal, but I don't believe that love has to end because one relationship morphs into another.  And I also don't believe that love is a zero-sum game, where I only have so much in my heart.  Love changes from Eros to Philios and to other forms of love.

I think there's a place for all sorts of perspectives on this.  Perhaps you don't like it, but calling it ""unhealthy"" seems rather closed-minded.  

I don't expect to convince you, as I don't think that logic has much place here - it's love after all, but to show that perhaps others feel differently.  :)"

NarcissisticAbuse,fgjc9ru,t1_fgiy6gg,1580841031.0,"So, hm.  The definition of ""empath"" is one who can actually feel the mental and emotional state of another human being.

However, the popular usage definition is like so:. ""With ""empathy"" you can imagine or understand to how someone might feel, without necessarily having those feelings yourself.""

I think that the word ""imagine"" is extremely important there.  And I think that is why a lot of people who are ""empaths"" end up with narcs.  Meaning, it's one thing to actually feel what a narc is feeling when they are manipulating, it's completely different to write the narrative in your head.   

I don't believe we have real ""empaths"" - but we do have people who are very good at putting themselves in other people's shoes and finding generous, kind reasons for their behavior.  Being understanding and accommodating.  And I think that's a very dangerous combination with a narcissist.

It sucks, but you aren't gonna die. (Assuming that you aren't a regular benzo user dealing with kindling, but it doesn't sound as if you are.)

Two things you can do.  Xanax works on the GABA neurotransmitter system.  There are two, easily available things that also work on GABA: 1) alcohol. 2) phenibut

My recommendation?  Get yourself a 12 pack of a nice craft beer.  Have two, and then taper down from there over a day or two.  

You are not going to sleep for 2 days, but you will sleep on the third.  You could take theanine which will help some with the jitters.  If you get phenibut, get capsules and take small amounts.  It's easy to overdo.

You are going to suffer some.  But you need this to stop now before it becomes a real problem.  Dont let this be the start of an alcohol or benzo addiction.  Just have enough beer (nothing stronger!) To ease some of the worst jitters.

I'm BP2, which isn't as prone to it, but I still went through periods of very serious doubt about my disease.  Like, strangely large amounts of it. Particularly as compared to my unipolar depression phase way back in the day - when that happened, I was like ""yeah, of course I am depressed.  hook me up with the meds""  I feel like it's almost diagnostic for Bipolar to go through this.

Here's a particularly scary quote from Wikipedia:  

*""In regard to psychiatric patients, empirical studies verify that, for individuals with severe mental illnesses, lack of awareness of illness is significantly associated with both medication non-compliance and re-hospitalization.*[*\[22\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia#cite_note-Insight&Psychosis-22) *Fifteen percent of individuals with severe mental illnesses who refuse to take medication voluntarily under any circumstances may require some form of* [*coercion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion) *to remain compliant because of anosognosia.*[*\[23\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia#cite_note-23) *Coercive psychiatric treatment is a delicate and complex legal and ethical issue.*

*One study of voluntary and involuntary inpatients confirmed that committed patients require* [*coercive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercive) *treatment because they fail to recognize their need for care.*[*\[24\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia#cite_note-pmid2564330-24) *The patients committed to the hospital had significantly lower measures of insight than the voluntary patients.""*

The only way out is for the episode to end naturally or for the meds to stabilize him out.  

I want to be REALLY CLEAR THAT I AM NOT GIVING ADVICE HERE.  But, the medication seems a bit odd?  Wellbutrin is a straight-up antidepressant with no mood stabilization characteristics.  TMS is used for bipolar depression, but doesn't have any FDA approved use for hypo/mania.  

Wellbutrin can induce ""phase shifting"" if used without a mood stabilizer (lithium, valproic acid, lamotrigine).  Meaning, it can push someone who is in bipolar depression too far and over into hypo/mania. If he is prone to mania, I'm kinda surprised that he's not getting one of those.  

The Wellbutrin is pushing him ""up.""  It's the most stimulating of all of the antidepressants.  The TMS was also to combat the depression.  

My guess is that his mania is going to come to a rather painful depressive end in fairly short order.  Please take steps to get him over to a psychiatrist as soon as is humanly possible.  

One thing I do want to say is that you can't really control this person.  They have to take responsibility for their own mental health.  You can help them, love them, assist them, but you can't protect them from themselves.

When he is back to being stable, you need to have some very hard conversations about what you will do that will keep you safe and sane."

It's the phrase ""lifestyle choice"" that is confusing me.  

Because if you are saying ""I can judge this group of people because of this one very specific example"" - well, these next few lines are for you:

Kinda like some straight people do, eh?   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child\_beauty\_pageant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_beauty_pageant) 

Or, you know, Jeffrey Epstein.  

Would I distance myself from people who did such a thing?  Yes.  Gay or straight.  Cis or Trans.  Would I paint an entire group of people with the actions of a few?  Nope.

I'm super open minded, and I have a lot of friends with alternative lifestyles.  I also completely support the right to choose who your fucking friends are for whatever reason you choose.  :)   I might judge the shit out of you, and might, in turn, choose not to be your friend, but I will absolutely fight for your right to make that choice.  It's ridiculous to be like ""hey you have to be friends with everyone, particularly if they are a kind of person that you have some problem with""  

One of my close friends has some very deep seated issues with gays.  He was abused by an uncle as a kid, and that's really stuck with him over the years.  I choose to be his friend even though he is homophobic because of how he was affected by this horrible event from his childhood."

Not to send, but to burn.  The act of handwriting does odd things in the brain and can really help get some of those feelings out.  I just helped someone do this a few days ago, and they have been able to at least start to move.

I'm sorry that you are dealing with this.  Remote hugs.  (If you are the hugging sort.  :) )"
