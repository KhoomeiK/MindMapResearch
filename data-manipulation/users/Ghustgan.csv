Warframe,fgoej53,t1_fgljrag,1580967319.0,This reads like the best warframe guide ever.
CharacterRant,fglj094,t3_ez46lh,1580900213.0,He started off with potential but he's boring now. Don't really care about Deku now. I prefer Koichi from Vigilantes.

As for the forerunner books. Well, I liked the mystery before their reveal. Magic is kinda gone now."

HaloStory,fgl95zb,t1_fgl8zik,1580886559.0,"That's nice of you mate. If you're talking about genres, I wouldn't know, I'm not much of a book reader. I've only read Fall of Reach, First Strike and Ghosts of Onyx. 

Regarding Halo stories, I guess anything that has to do with the Chief and/or the war. I'm not interested about the prequels with the Forerunners."
HaloStory,fgl8x16,t1_fgjydxo,1580886275.0,Good advice I may check them out.
animememes,fgjxu1k,t3_eyube8,1580853504.0,"Wait, I like this anime"
OnePiece,fgjxlmg,t3_eys6f2,1580853365.0,"Great theories in the OP and comments but I'm going to say, Zoro's current situation is inspired from real life pirates.

I recall reading that the eyepatch would keep the covered eye from adjusting to light outside, so pirates could use the covered eye to see in the dark. This would eliminate the need to wait for both eyes to adjust to the darkness in the lower decks and the sunshine on the surface.

I'm going with Zoro doing something similar. He trained that eye to deal with a certain something and will open it when he's in real trouble, against Shilliew (who turns invisible) or something."
OnePiece,fgjwytv,t1_fgjvu4d,1580853011.0,That's because it is one of the best fights ever adapted.

HaloStory,fgjrrle,t3_eymbmt,1580850114.0,"I only care about the Chief and the human-covenant war, so, Fall of Reach is the best thing to me."
CharacterRant,fgjrdoa,t3_eyqiho,1580849896.0,"I agree with 95% of this post. I enjoyed Vigilantes a lot more. Koichi is a true average joe in a sea of monsters, his ability is great for the series and he never gets power ups, only utility skills, so he has to stay brave throughout. He's extremely relatable without being a doormat like Deku was.

Knuckleduster is easily the best thing to come out of the Hero Academia-verse as a whole. Knuckle Duster vs Aizawa was goosebumpy as all fuck. This includes their physical altercation as well as the philosophical exchange. Great stuff.

Captain Celebrity started off kinda weird but he turned out to be a great character overall. He's a flawed superman and it comes off quite naturally in him. His struggles are things we have to deal with too, which makes him relatable despite being superman.

Pop Step and Makoto are kinda in the background though and I think they could've been fleshed out some more. It was teased that Pop Step was heading into the direction of an evacuation specialist but nothing came out of it.

The cameos from the cast of the main series were handled very well too.

Overall it's a tighter experience and that's why it's better."
Kengan_Ashura,fgi3ec7,t3_ey9sgp,1580803651.0,"Adamantine wouldn't have helped him as a kid or a teen at all. He was fighting adults all the time.  Redirection on the other hand, is a different story. It helps trip overly aggressive and / or arrogant adults and he could escape."
fo4,fggu8jq,t1_fgfmids,1580769681.0,I can't believe you've done this.
Kengan_Ashura,fggkc49,t1_fgf89zl,1580763662.0,Just watch out of that heart failure.
Kengan_Ashura,fgf6r5i,t3_exz3n3,1580727488.0,It also helps that Kaneda has one of the most overpowered abilities in the series.

todayilearned,fgaqyq1,t1_fgaqo46,1580654379.0,The guards thing is a good point actually. Can't say the same about the bases though.
todayilearned,fgaqs1g,t1_fgap9i1,1580654313.0,"Yeah well not sure playing world police, committing war crimes and sending their own people abroad to die for profit count as valid reasons."

todayilearned,fgampn8,t1_fgam3a5,1580653070.0,How are they not playing world police if they do send people abroad to shoot other guys?
todayilearned,fgamaey,t1_fgali0e,1580652936.0,"No idea why you're getting so triggered.

In any case, fine, even dropping the obvious implication of what you wrote, then taking your current case and running with it, still an immoral thing to do, all things considered. Joined a criminal organisation for profit.

So yes, we are back at square one, regarding conscience (or lack thereof) and all that jazz."
todayilearned,fgallkz,t1_fgakg4k,1580652680.0,"Well, exactly, **some**. Doesn't sound like it's the majority and frankly, anyone believing that would be a fool. In turn, this makes the plea moot when looking at the overall picture. 

The only reason I'm arguing semantics is because, since you made it personal, I didn't want to insult whatever happened to your family. Doesn't make joining the military any more moral overall, that's why I called a case like yours an exception."
todayilearned,fgakvag,t1_fgagzrq,1580652434.0,">most people who volunteer don’t come from well off families. They join up because the GI bill is the only way they can afford college, or because the military is their only option for a steady job and provides them with housing

So it's these circumstances that force people to join, because they have no other options ain't that right?

But since you deny the above, then all that means is that those people could've done something else as well, only it wouldn't have paid as much, which essentially means they chose to do it because it would serve them best. Which brings us back to square one. They chose to deploy without really caring about the institution they are helping run. 

That's fine and dandy but one can't make them seem sympathetic and moral when we all know militaries commit shitty deeds abroad."
todayilearned,fgajf3w,t1_fg9vmj8,1580651996.0,"Not sure where to even begin with this one.

First of all, not everyone on the internet is american.

Second. War crimes of large scale were always committed by althe military of some country in some big war.

Third: See point number one.

Fourth: Fighting for your survival vs sending troops abroad to kill and take shit are two different things."
todayilearned,fgaiafl,t1_fga7lhz,1580651548.0,Not just the US military.

todayilearned,fgai4id,t1_fga4mrq,1580651470.0,So all those who chose to enlist had absolutely no other way out? Do you know which countries sell the most weapons and send troops abroad? It's not the countries with the most starved people.

todayilearned,fgah6mf,t1_fga6tva,1580651218.0,Not disagreeing but ultimately it's each person for themselves that they chose to support organisations that commit atrocities and stuff.
todayilearned,fgah2tq,t1_fgaftwx,1580651171.0,This also plays a role.
todayilearned,fgagyr2,t1_fgaajzc,1580651112.0,"So, everyone enlists to use the military's funding and then leaves? That's nice of the state tbh"

todayilearned,fg9uj7u,t1_fg9u56c,1580643354.0,Sure everyone is free to do what they want but there is a line: one position supports an industry killing thousands and the other isn't.
todayilearned,fg9tzf9,t1_fg9takq,1580643175.0,"Some other guy replied to me that they retired early thanks to the military, so I dunno what to believe.

So you're saying it's circumstances and yet from what I gather joining the military doesn't just help pay the bills, it does more than that, so people just don't care as long as they're well off. 

Doesn't really help make them more sympathetic."
todayilearned,fg9th4d,t1_fg9t99f,1580642965.0,"Yeah well one is still part of the whole thing, actively supporting it. Just saying."

metro,fg9rizh,t3_exiizi,1580642297.0,I hope we don't. I don't care about it and Sam himself being a main char was jarring enough. At best he should just find a means to go home and end it there as a good ending.
todayilearned,fg9r08g,t1_fg9qe7r,1580642179.0,"I guess manual labor or working  some other normal job wouldn't have led to an early retirement, aka being well off, right?"
todayilearned,fg9oovk,t1_fg9n59p,1580641420.0,Sounds like the exception.
todayilearned,fg9liya,t1_fg9kuca,1580640419.0,Still a choice. Or are you saying they have no other choice?
todayilearned,fg9kkmu,t1_fg8ixih,1580639938.0,Only true for conscripts / draftees. All those who enlist and become professional soldiers know full well what they're doing.
