OLD DOGS DON'T DIE:

Old dogs don't die; they can't. They've merely run up ahead; they're waiting for us just out of sight. Close your eyes late at night and you may smell his musky odor, or perhaps hear his snuffle from the next room. Pay attention and you may feel his nose on your hand or the back of your calf. When your final day comes, you can go on to meet him; he's never left you and never will, and when you close your eyes for the last time, you'll open them again to be met with his Bright eyes and wagging tail.

Old dogs don't die, at least, not those dogs who take the biggest chunks of our hearts with them when they leave us. Those dogs are inextricably part of our souls, and they go with us wherever we are. Though we may not see them, we know they're there because our heart is still beating; we still breathe, and those of us who have been truly touched by a good dog know our lives really started the day we met them.

Magnificent dogs don't die. They shepherd our dreams and only allow the good ones through the gates of our consciousness. They watch over us much as they did in life, and that moment when we step just barely outside of death or disaster, it's because they moved our feet or they stopped short in front of us as they did in life. 

You see, a good dog is something only given to a few people. They are a gift from the universe and, though they're with us only a short time, they never really leave us. They are loyalty and love perfected, and once we are graced with that sort of love we can never lose it. We merely lose sight of it for a time, and that is our fault; for how can love like that ever go away?

It can't. It can't, and it never will. For these brave souls trade their hearts for ours, and they beat together beyond sickness, beyond death. They are ours, and we are theirs, for every sunrise and every sunset, until the sun blazes its last and we once again join the stars.

1: There are 3,141 counties in the United

Only 57.

3: Clinton won the popular vote by approx.
1.5 million votes.
4: In the 5 counties that encompass NYC,

Queens) Clinton received well over 2
million more votes than Trump. (Clinton
only on 4 of these counties: Trump won
Richmond) Therefore these 5 counties
alone, more than accounted for Clinton
winning the popular vote of the entire
country.
5: These 5 counties comprise 319 square
miles. The United States is comprised of

6: When you have a country that

miles of territory, it would be ludicrous to
even suggest that the vote of those who

dictate the outcome of a national election.
Large, densely populated Democrat cities

Know this, if you don't want to know, you won't.  Before that, you'll have to want to learn and follow Gods path for you.  I warn you, it may lead you in difficult paths you don't expect.  I'm not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, even though I have a testimony of it.  I didn't want to believe in God, but I was looking for truth wherever I could find it.  And I found it.  I promise you this.  Reading, studying, and learning from The Book of Mormon will make you a better man, no matter where you are led, or in my case, sent.  Maybe someday The Lord will lead me to The Church, maybe not.  I have become a True Disciple who goes where he is sent and does what is set before me.  I now live a life of love, joy and peace.

You see, a good dog is something only given to a few people. They are a gift from the universe and, though they're with us only a short time, they never really leave us. They are loyalty and love perfected, and once we are graced with that sort of love we can never lose it. We merely lose sight of it for a time, and that is our fault; for how can love like that ever go away?

It can't. It can't, and it never will. For these brave souls trade their hearts for ours, and they beat together beyond sickness, beyond death. They are ours, and we are theirs, for every sunrise and every sunset, until the sun blazes its last and we once again join the stars.

OLD DOGS DON'T DIE:

Old dogs don't die; they can't. They've merely run up ahead; they're waiting for us just out of sight. Close your eyes late at night and you may smell his musky odor, or perhaps hear his snuffle from the next room. Pay attention and you may feel his nose on your hand or the back of your calf. When your final day comes, you can go on to meet him; he's never left you and never will, and when you close your eyes for the last time, you'll open them again to be met with his Bright eyes and wagging tail.

Old dogs don't die, at least, not those dogs who take the biggest chunks of our hearts with them when they leave us. Those dogs are inextricably part of our souls, and they go with us wherever we are. Though we may not see them, we know they're there because our heart is still beating; we still breathe, and those of us who have been truly touched by a good dog know our lives really started the day we met them.

Queens) Clinton received well over 2
million more votes than Trump. (Clinton
only on 4 of these counties: Trump won
Richmond) Therefore these 5 counties
alone, more than accounted for Clinton
winning the popular vote of the entire
country.
5: These 5 counties comprise 319 square

6: When you have a country that

miles of territory, it would be ludicrous to

inhabit a mere 319 square miles should
dictate the outcome of a national election.
Large, densely populated Democrat cities

It can't. It can't, and it never will. For these brave souls trade their hearts for ours, and they beat together beyond sickness, beyond death. They are ours, and we are theirs, for every sunrise and every sunset, until the sun blazes its last and we once again join the stars.

Dachshund,fdxx1g0,t3_enboqw,1578773822.0,"Old dogs don't die; they can't. They've merely run up ahead; they're waiting for us just out of sight. Close your eyes late at night and you may smell his musky odor, or perhaps hear his snuffle from the next room. Pay attention and you may feel his nose on your hand or the back of your calf. When your final day comes, you can go on to meet him; he's never left you and never will, and when you close your eyes for the last time, you'll open them again to be met with his Bright eyes and wagging tail.

Old dogs don't die, at least, not those dogs who take the biggest chunks of our hearts with them when they leave us. Those dogs are inextricably part of our souls, and they go with us wherever we are. Though we may not see them, we know they're there because our heart is still beating; we still breathe, and those of us who have been truly touched by a good dog know our lives really started the day we met them.

Magnificent dogs don't die. They shepherd our dreams and only allow the good ones through the gates of our consciousness. They watch over us much as they did in life, and that moment when we step just barely outside of death or disaster, it's because they moved our feet or they stopped short in front of us as they did in life. 

You see, a good dog is something only given to a few people. They are a gift from the universe and, though they're with us only a short time, they never really leave us. They are loyalty and love perfected, and once we are graced with that sort of love we can never lose it. We merely lose sight of it for a time, and that is our fault; for how can love like that ever go away?

It can't. It can't, and it never will. For these brave souls trade their hearts for ours, and they beat together beyond sickness, beyond death. They are ours, and we are theirs, for every sunrise and every sunset, until the sun blazes its last and we once again join the stars.

I happen to have a testimony of the truth that was difficult to acquire and more difficult to nail down.  It starts with a sincere reading of The Book of Mormon alongside The Bible, first of all to desire to learn and know the truth, and second to be open to the teachings of The Spirit.  Know this, if you don't want to know, you won't.  Before that, you'll have to want to learn and follow Gods path for you.  I warn you, it may lead you in difficult paths you don't expect.  I'm not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, even though I have a testimony of it.  I didn't want to believe in God, but I was looking for truth wherever I could find it.  And I found it.  I promise you this.  Reading, studying, and learning from The Book of Mormon will make you a better man, no matter where you are led, or in my case, sent.  Maybe someday The Lord will lead me to The Church, maybe not.  I have become a True Disciple who goes where he is sent and does what is set before me.  I now live a life of love, joy and peace.  It isn't easy, but it is highly satisfying.  It probably isn't a life for you, but who knows?  I just ask you to understand others may have a different experience from you and ask you to respect that.  Blessings to you, however you travel."
