dogs,fc1k9l5,t1_fc15upg,1577321279.0,That’s honestly the best bet. Breeds tell you nothing. I was mauled by a family friendly pet. We had golden retrievers who were insane. I’ve never met a pit bull who was mean. Doesn’t mean they don’t exist! Just means don’t judge a book by its cover.
dogs,fc1517i,t1_fc11rz9,1577308453.0,So specifically the American pit bull terrier? Or any of the breeds CALLED pit bulls? Because you should know that studies aren’t talking about one dog but many terriers and bulldogs.
dogs,fc14uuf,t1_fc13ef8,1577308309.0,Behavioral components are at work. But have a nice Christmas.
dogs,fc12dz5,t1_fc10w02,1577306295.0,"This. They’re on the opposite end. “All pit bulls are bad because...” is just as bad as “no, pit bulls are fine because.” 

Just treat every dog case by case or you’re going to have a bad time eventually. 

Dogs bite. But it’s usually because PEOPLE are making mistakes."
dogs,fc128v8,t1_fc0zieo,1577306179.0,And Labrador retrievers are 10th in bite stats from 82-2014. “Pit bulls” are third in bite force at 235 pounds of pressure. Labs are 230.  Their jaws do not “lock” as people claim. So what about bites and deaths are different than with other breeds?
dogs,fc0wp6z,t1_fc0vugu,1577301695.0,"Using breed to predict biting behavior is a poor choice. Any dog can bite. Siberian huskies are just as likely to bite. In fact, quite a lot of bites are likely misidentified as “pit bulls” when that is really a catch all for several breeds sharing similar looks.

It goes both ways. Treat dogs on a case by case basis."
