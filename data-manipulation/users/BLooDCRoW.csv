aww,ff4opv9,t3_erl4yv,1579568769.0,"John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963. Various Agencies and government panels have investigated the assassination at length, drawing different conclusions. Lee Harvey Oswald is accepted by official investigations as being the assassin, but he was murdered before he could be tried in a court of law. The discrepancies between the official investigations and the extraordinary nature of the assassination have led to a variety of theories as to how and why President Kennedy was assassinated.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded in 1979 that, although Oswald assassinated Kennedy, a conspiracy was probable, but it did not implicate US intelligence agencies. Their conclusion was reached almost entirely because of the results of forensic analysis of a police dictabelt, which supposedly recorded the sound of a fourth bullet being fired in Dealey Plaza. The HSCA also stated that President Kennedy did not receive adequate protection in Dallas, as Secret Service agents in the motorcade were inadequately prepared to protect the President from a sniper and had not acted upon some relevant information. This lack of protection may have occurred because Kennedy himself had specifically asked that the Secret Service make itself discreet during the Dallas visit[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/erl4yv/just_watch/ff4hd69/)"

Of course it's not normal to socialize with a wild apex predator, but I'm sure people realize that this cat is getting fed and cared for enough to the point that it's allowed itself to turn into a big kitty cat.
