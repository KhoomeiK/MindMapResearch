Trump is the anti-vaccine – think ebola – to absolutely everything, including humanity and to vaccines themselves, being anti-vax. Trump lost the popular election to Hillary Rodham-Clinton.

They've both made a ton of critical releases. They're both corporate funded journalism and it's always been biased and subject to conflicts of corporate interest. There are plenty of alternatives, some even excellent. NYT simply cannot die, no matter what, and no matter how much Republicans would revel in that. It fought US Supreme Court to retain our freedoms of press in upholding the US Constitution. I think it'd do the same all over again, if Trump's threats to remove our rights are carried out. There are too few standards upholding our ethical responsibility as a nation and too many threats against them, so it's hard for me to even consider criticizing them without a thoughtful explanation."

I fret about it, even though I don't really see the point in fretting, when AI will take over driving, soon enough. For now, they're more concerned about them not killing anyone and integrating with our old-fashioned human controls, but eventually they'll be interfacing with eachother, to prioritize right-of-way and to optimize traffic.

If you like It's All in Your Mind, it's interesting to note that he originally released it as a b-side to a single, Steve Threw Up, which is a track that was never included in an album release, and the styling is lo-fi/acoustic and  quite different from the recording on Sea Change.
My favorite album is One Foot in the Grave, but mostly because I love his collaborators and the indie/lo-fi styling. Mutations is very good, especially noting the secret track, Diamond Bullocks, with those heavy, driving drums, the hooks and its dynamic style changes. Modern Guilt really reaches me emotionally, and I think it's a shame it wasn't better received by critics. It touches upon some of the lo-fi style he left behind, and I figure it missed the mark, for some industry wonks, but it was a nice throwback, and I think he ventured into new, strange ground with it, lyrically and stylistically."

Anyway, he's always distanced himself from Scientology, either publicly through his  words or his more typical lengthy silence, so it's probably safe to assume the title had nothing to do with Scientology, but who knows.
