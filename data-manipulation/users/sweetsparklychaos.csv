Allergies,fgjoluu,t3_eyv18r,1580848314.0,"I've been crazy allergic to cats my whole life. Helped some friends with a wildlife rescue raise a lion. He was two weeks old when we got him and 7 months old when placed in a safe licensed facility. 
I had no allergy problems with him, ever and we used to wrestle and play. 
They have different DNA than domestic cats."
