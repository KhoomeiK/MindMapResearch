It's a type of gel that is formulated to resemble pig flesh (our closest match in terms of like muscle/fat ratio, etc). Forensic labs use it to test the effect of projectiles, usually bullets, on human flesh seeing as actually testing on humans would be unethical. When they shoot into it they can see how the bullet disperses and such on impact and they've even put bones into the gel at points to see how certain bullets would interact with a bone contained in flesh."

It wont be the fault of the delivery company, because they did their diligence in delivering the package to the specified location.

If the office was locked, then the leasing office has a responsibility to file a police report, and if they have theft insurance then you may have a fighting chance. But if the office was unlocked, they will most likely not be covered by insurance and wont cover you.

You could maybe take them to small claims or a local tenancy board but the cost and hassle of that may not be worth it to you. Or they may not be raging assholes and compensate you for the package. But ultimately it's going to boil down to what the leasing office chooses to do.
