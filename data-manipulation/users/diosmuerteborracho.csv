patientgamers,ffcphpf,t1_ffcidfu,1579804448.0,"Mine doesn't have games on the shelves, but other libraries in the network do. Some libraries you can get an interlibrary loan for games. Also most libraries you can request items. If you're willing to talk to a librarian at the information desk, it's their job to help you find what you want."
steelydancirclejerk,ffa1785,t3_ese5zh,1579725820.0,I don't know who these people are.
patientgamers,ff9g3cx,t3_es9hcw,1579712267.0,"A few years ago I got out my SNES and revisited Ken Griffey Jr. Major League Baseball. I love the art for that game, but I especially love the roster. It's got obviously fake names for every player except Griffey, most of which are pop culture references. John Waters and Divine play for the Baltimore Orioles, the St. Louis Cardinals have comedians like Milton Berle, George Burns, Bill Cosby, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chaplin, and there's a ton of punk rock musicians and authors. Who puts Johnny Thunders in a sports video game?? I still think about Can O'Corn a lot.

Also when the batter strikes out and barrels the camera to say ""OH COME ON!!"" -- that's a Jim Belushi sample from The Man With One Red Shoe!"
FREE,ff9db2z,t3_es5twv,1579710491.0,"The Google Play Store is how I got back into gaming. PITY ME!

There's lots of great stuff there, but you have to sift through so much garbage. I can recommend solid IAP/ad free games if anyone's interested."

todayilearned,ff7wmcb,t1_ff7e3aw,1579660101.0,Not to be a drag but the character's name was Binky. What a brilliant movie. Bobcat Goldthwaite's directorial debut. Adam Sandler and Robin Williams had bit parts too!

HelpMeFind,ff6bgrg,t1_ff69zd2,1579623537.0,Third party here. It did look like you were calling that person a pedophile. Plain text can be hard to infer tone and there are a lot of trolls on this website. Thats my unsolicited chime-in of the day. Have a okay one y'all.
todayilearned,ff3yprc,t3_erhn58,1579551763.0,I don't want to cyber with any of these guys!
patientgamers,ff3vapr,t1_ff3kn87,1579549627.0,"There's a podcast called Bonfireside Chat that dives into DS lore. I haven't played any Souls games but I really like the other podcasts these folks put out, specifically Watch Out For Fireballs. WOFF is a great patient gamer podcast."
patientgamers,ff3v425,t1_ff3jfcg,1579549512.0,The alt text makes me feel sad and old.
patientgamers,ff3n7yt,t3_erbbh3,1579544662.0,"You should try Kingdom Come Deliverance. It feels like a medieval simulator. There are SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES to pretty much all your actions. You start as a dumb blacksmith's kid who cannot read or fight, and you have to learn how to do everything. The side quest where you learn to read was quite novel. I can't speak to the ending(s?) because I've only put 60 hours into it and am nowhere close to the end."
gamingsuggestions,ff302yv,t3_er92yy,1579530033.0,Knights of Pen and Paper is a good one. Chroma Squad is also fun and tactics based.
patientgamers,ff2yoi2,t1_ff2j8bo,1579528831.0,"RDR2 had me watching a ton of westerns too, but also reading a bunch of great Western books. True Grit, The Sisters Brothers, a bio of Billy The Kid, bio of Wyatt Earp, and a historian's take on the Native genocide.

I just finished Hitman 2 and put a hold on Day of the Jackal, but I've already moved on to Uncharted and am afraid I'll jump straight into Indiana Jones haha"
cripplingalcoholism,fezfcd7,t3_eqy0w1,1579456764.0,"It's way easier to blame external forces for your own problems if you don't want to work on yourself. Sounds like your folks might have some shitty coping strategies and don't want to deal with their own feelings and behaviors. If you are like me and learned how to manage your emotions from folks who have no skills in managing their own, it's no wonder why you drink. 

 Fibromyalgia sucks shit but you didn't cause it. I do not have any advice for you, other than to take care of yourself and remember you are NOT responsible for how your family feels."
patientgamers,fezafo4,t1_fez1ag9,1579455336.0,"I especially liked the short story format in The Last Wish. I'm a sucker for trope perversion. The rest of the books are long form stories and do not stand alone. They are a series. I feel like there's a word for what I'm trying to say but I can't remember it and it's bugging the shit out of me. They are sequential? Chronological? Pick up where the last one left off?

Help pls"
patientgamers,fez9rqa,t1_fez608d,1579455111.0,"Yeah, the Witcher books and Fable books predated the games. Not sure if the specific The Wolf Among Us comic predated the game though. There are the TLOU comics written by the game's writer, which came out after the game. I can't speak to their quality. The Spider-Man novel actually came out before the game, I guess as promotion. It explains some of the world state, which I was into because I wasn't up on hardly any current spider-lore."
gamesuggestions,feylwzp,t3_equssd,1579447364.0,Tyranny has an interesting build your own spell mechanic. Is that the kind of thing you're looking for?
cripplingalcoholism,feylbc6,t3_eqt6rz,1579447115.0,"Clary sage is lovely. I ended up white knuckling through opiate withdrawals at guitar camp using massive amounts of lavender, peppermint, pine, and clary sage oils. They didn't really help that much but I smelled lovely."
OldSchoolCool,feyimba,t3_eqqpme,1579445949.0,The way you're looking at your mom is so incredibly sweet. I love it. You're both adorable.
patientgamers,feyccux,t3_equuy1,1579443682.0,"I read two of the graphic novels because I was head over heels for the world, but I was not a fan of the writing in the comics. To me, the dialogue read like fanfic and did not hold up the standard of the games.

On the other hand, I really loved the Witcher books, the Fable comics, and even kind of enjoyed the Spider-Man prequel to the video game novel. I am curious about The Last of Us comics written by Neil Druckmann."
cripplingalcoholism,fesfcal,t3_eqbn71,1579364549.0,Corngratulations squirt! I've read a lot of server job stories here so be careful not to sleep with your managers parents!
truegaming,fesa1jd,t1_fepxyt4,1579363093.0,I love missions that do that in any game. Seemingly small moments that shake up the normal gameplay loop and have interesting (or at least different) quest design.
PS4Deals,fep77zk,t1_feonwr3,1579313691.0,Actually you are the only one who does that.
PS4Deals,feoyadi,t1_feowr7k,1579308011.0,"It's been out for at least a few years, idk about 2013 but maybe!"
PS4Deals,feo0owy,t1_fensxan,1579293564.0,"Have you ever played True Skate? It's a mobile game and basically just a proof of concept, but the touchscreen controls are wonderful. Feels like playing with a tech deck."

cripplingalcoholism,femvej9,t3_eppzig,1579270632.0,Sounds like you need to play Hatoful Boyfriend. It's a Japanese dating sim (I know I know) except you go to a high school for pigeons (I know!)
