There are, as with everything, people at the extremes saying you Def shouldn't and some saying you Def should, and that's why one has to do research."

Of course you can do whatever the fuck you want I never said otherwise, you're the one who switched from ""pain in the ass"" to ""hard"". it's not like I'm lying when I say buying precut fruit is a very very consumer attitude, people just don't like to be called out on it, you're prime example of this."
AskReddit,fh74hik,t1_fh73wt4,1581314812.0,"Sure mate, it's soooo hard to tell if it's ripe and even harder to cut it, what a pain in the ass right? Gtfo learning about fruit is super easy and useful and cutting fruit is not hard at all wtf lol these levels of confort are really making us incompetent in simple matters.

""100% worth it"" lol insane stuff"

Ayahuasca,fgzummj,t1_fgx5goj,1581197788.0,"Yeah I mean it's different for everyone, for example the last ceremony I went to, there was a woman who had just been violently  raped, days prior to the ceremony.. She was so broken I thought ""this cannot be good for her"" but lo and behold she came out the other end with a freaking smile on her face having even forgiven her assailant. But circumstances are different for everyone.

I'm especially curious about your experiences of having died, because the first time it happened to me, there was no going back, it's not as if I was cured as in medicine-cured, but rather what I found out, what I realized, like this eureka moment of enlightenment, like waking up while already awake. 

It's hard to explain but indeed neither ayahuasca nor bufo cured me, but rather what these substances allowed me to realize.

I would say all in due time, Aya and bufo are deep plunges into the psyque, maybe just dip your toes with regular therapy for a while, perhaps some ssri's for a bit just to get your balance back.. I once spent I don't know how many months locked up in my bedroom unable to go out and that shit is so dark and it perpetuates itself, so yeah something is better than nothing.

Reach out, you've already got my vibes coming your way, for whatever it's worth :p"
Ayahuasca,fgulix3,t3_f0gvpb,1581123810.0,"I've had severe trauma, and in one ceremony I ""died"".. Then... Pop! Back into existence, cured once and for all from the negative thoughts, paralyzing lethargy of mind and extreme sweats from anxiety.

Since my only advice would indeed be ""take more"" ill abstain from that, it's true that some people need to get just a bit more stable before taking this plunge. Anyways, my 2 cents. Much love."

worldnews,ffj15lo,t1_ffit03h,1579987777.0,It would also be more accurate and less ambiguous. That is my only point.
worldnews,ffin8ym,t1_ffila8c,1579977941.0,"It's misleading, its ambiguous and it misrepresents the situation because of that. 

It's not like they are so overworked that they can't even go to the bathroom, however that's what seems to be happening at first glance of the title, and not everyone is going to have the time to read the article ans disambiguate the title.

 In a situation like this we need to be careful to not spread unnecessary panic. This title spreads unnecessary panic."

GetMotivated,feoxxla,t1_fenu6r4,1579307794.0,"No it doesn't imply that, it's literally an anecdote. 

It's what happened to one person, and if you see yourself reflected in that anecdote, then it's useful to you, if not, it's not. In no way is this person telling their story ""gaslighting"" or victim blaming, it's just a different perspective they're offering, for those who might find it useful.

Edit: or are you saying that the anecdote-telling-person is not right and interpreted the situation wrong? Because that's going a bit far with little information."
GetMotivated,fenksgh,t1_fenh8eu,1579286809.0,"I think op understood lol it's just that there's always people overanalyzing anything inspirational just to prove the quote is not immaculate.

Sure it may not be immaculate but the place where it isn't immaculate is irrelevant to op's point.

One has 2 options in the face of something intended to be inspirational, either you are inspired and ""get it"" or you aren't inspired and ignore it or proceed to explain why it's wrong or where there are holes.

OP is essentially saying ""sure, you're right, but you're missing the point"""
