oilpen,ffgsd9m,t1_ffgoffs,1579913827.0,"Well I am saddened to hear this because, while i often rib NC over dumb stuff, but I do I think it is a great state if you ignore some of the people that live here. And I don't mean that politically. I mean it in the Golden Rule type way. 

I'm not going to waste any of my time or emotions on hateful people. For example, the folks that built that 150 foot tall Confederate flag on the side of I-95 near Godwin. If you're driving on I-95 through North Carolina, you can go ahead and ignore that bit of ugliness, I sure do. 

Instead, I think it's nice to realize that other than California, there's not really any other state that can boast about mountains over 6,500', numerous ski resorts, the US National whitewater facility, ancient seabed Sandhills famous for golfing, along with hundreds of.miles of unspoiled beach and barrier islands that year after year end up #1 (at least top 5) Dr. Beach's best beach. The geologic diversity here is really enviable!"

oilpen,ffgmqc3,t1_ffgmha2,1579909833.0,"Wow, thank you so much for all the info. Definitely wasn't asking for anything revealing or that could get you in trouble. I was more just curious about how these things ran and if there was so much product that they could run continuously and not run out. Just a heads up that you did mention the name (starts with a T) in your last paragraph, but that may be the brand of the filling machine.

EDIT: BTW, I know your pain regarding having to keep track of a huge tray of tubes your filling. At least with the oil, you're just putting the oil in there. When I worked in a genetics lab we would use a tray with 96 different Wells that we would have to inject 8 different things and to each one.  I can't tell you how many times I would have to scrap an entire experiment simply because someone called me and distracted me when I was filling row 7 up with chemical 5 (out of 8) and now I can't remember if I already added the chem to row 3 cylinder 4 or if I left off on cylinder 6.......

Making it worse was the fact that we were injecting such small volumes ( injecting 5 microliters into some of them) that it was impossible just to look and see which ones have liquid in them to determine where you left off.

I went in to work one afternoon on LSD (only 2 or 3 hits) and it was impossible to keep track off. Even with my lab journal and notes helping me. I  had to trash it and switch to a different project that day lol. Back then, if I found a good acid oh, I would try and buy as much as possible because it was pretty rare back then. I would aim to at least have 50 or 60 hits before the semester ended in spring. That would last me until the end of summer when everyone would come back (hopefully w goodies!)

Got to remember that after that huge abandoned missile silo LSD raid in the early 2000s, LSD became very hard to get and when you did, it was typically 2-3 blotters to have a good solid strong trip. None of that split one blotter four ways and each quarter get you ripped. The best I ever got was purple windowpane acid and it was crucial!

Once the dark web hit, it was almost like living through a miniature psychedelic 60s for a little bit because suddenly LSD was plentiful and everywhere. However, I would imagine that RCs like 25I-NBOMe and others that very closely  resemble a LSD trip are what a lot of the youth are actually experiencing today. You would have had to have tripped LSD previously in order to know the difference between their trips. One clue is that LSD, while bitter, does not numb the mouth like 25I-NBOMe does."
oilpen,ffgmi6t,t1_ffg3eub,1579909681.0,"Yeah being in NC sucks because not only is it illegal, but the way our state has been voting in conservatives to the state legislature the past 10 years, you know it's not going to change either!

I tell you man, before the mid-2000s, North Carolina was really in on ball when it came to the South. We routinely elected Republicans for Governor and president, but the state historically elected Democrats to the state senate and house.

It was because of this and senator Terry Sanford's push, that North Carolina put a high value on education. In a region known for having the lowest per-student dollar education budgets, North Carolina was well known for having amazing universities and numerous education programs and opportunities.

In 2010 or 12, the Democrats lost control both the House and Senate in North Carolina for the first time in a hundred years and North Carolina was changed forever as a result.

Before this, the movie and television studios in Wilmington were the largest outside of Hollywood and hundreds of famous movies, TV shows, and music videos were filmed here. In addition, the industry supported tens of thousands of jobs due to all of the trade profession needs of the studios. Hundreds of local businesses thrived and grew because the studios needed local electricians, hair and makeup, vehicle rentals, carpenters and plumbers for sets, manual labor, camera equipment service and rental, lighting and sound equipment gear and operators. Just like the military, showbiz typically has their version of every trade that exist in the civilian world.

When the republican-controlled state legislature elected to not renew tax incentives for the entertainment industry, every single studio jump shiped to Georgia where their Republican controlled legislature offered tax incentives to set up shop. Now Georgia boasts the second Hollywood title and all of the billions that come with it.

Don't forget that the NC Republicans were willing to let the entire tourism industry in the state wither away and die by passing the disastrous HB2 ""bathroom bill."" Even after seeing every major event, charity, athletic tournament, organization, business, and even entire other countries and states boycott North Carolina and her businesses to the tune of $500,000,000 (and probably much higher irl), the Republicans still would not alter the bill. Only after the Republican Governor lost his re-election bid (some say because of the bill) did the bathroom portion of the bill get repealed."
oilpen,ffgkaxd,t1_ffg2dx2,1579908193.0,"Question: knowing that you were capable of pumping out carts to the tune of 1,200 or so a day, do operations on that level fill all the time?

Or do you guys produce and collect enough untill it hits a magic number such as 2 lb or something and then proceed to have a ""fill week"" during which all of that product gets assembled and ready for sale? 

Or is there enough product/labor always there / coming in to where you or someone else just focuses on filling or some related tasks because even if you knocked out 10,000 carts in a week, there's always more to fill (i.e. continuous production)"

oilpen,ffgiyfd,t1_ffggbip,1579907309.0,"I was surprised when I went to Boston and the recreational dispensary there, NETA, did not offer anything that was not made by them. They had every type of cannabis and product, but their version of it.

So instead of offering cartridges made by raw garden, select or any other brand; you can only purchase cartridges filled by them containing their own distill it or resin. Same goes for the edibles and other extracts. Want to buy the same gummies you tried out west? You can purchase and gummy made by them and hope it's similar lol.

Apparently they are a collective, so they only offer stuff under their house brand. Imagine Costco, but they only sold their Kirkland version of everything. 

I would love it if they did this as another option in each category, but I think they're only getting away with it now because there is no other competition yet. For example, I would love to have the option of purchase a cheaper house Indica cartridge, but I would still I want to be able to buy already known and reviewed third party products.

trees,ffdd71w,t1_ffdak3n,1579818402.0,"Lol I fell asleep in McDonald's lot once and woke up to this HUGE Mexican family knocking on all my windows waking me up. As soon as I woke up and sat up, the cops were already walking up and were trying to book me for a DUI bc the keys were in and the car was running in idle (it was very cold)

Had to do all the tests, the balancing and the blow test. All in the parking lot of a very busy McDs and every single customer watching me. After the third breathalyzer was still showing zero, you should have seen the three cops in charge trying to figure out what to do. After a powwow and discussion, they gave me another round of inebriation tests along with another breathalyzer that once again showed no BAC. 

You would think that after 4 breathalyzer tests and numerous side of the road field tests all showing no inebriation and no blood alcohol content, the police would 
realize there was no ineebriation so therefore no DUI and let me move along, right??? Wellllll.......

So even though they found no evidence of inebriation, did not see me driving or operating the vehicle, and 4 breathalyzer tests came back showing  0 alcohol (not a little, not a ""teeny tiny bit""), the officer-in-charge determined I must be lying so they arrest me and drag me to the local hospital in cuffs so they can pull blood to test if I have some unknown intoxicant in me.

Boy oh boy, if you thought nurses could be rude and rough before, wait till a police officer escorts you into the ER in handcuffs and tells the nurse you're being arrested under suspicion of DUI! I swear to God the mean looks could have burned holes through the toughest titanium. The fact that the inexperienced phlebotomist struggled and that I have old track marks resulted in them treating me like a pincushion. So cruel. You can tell the nurses are burned out from the police bringing numerous people there.

After the blood draw, I was taken to the county jail and released by The magistrate after a few hours.

The end result? Had to pay an attorney about $1,500 to fight the charge. BTW, the state kept continuing the case because my blood results had not arrived back from the lab. After a year of the state asking for continuances, I was surprised my lawyer was able to get the case dismissed! 

So because I fell asleep in my truck at McDonald's while waiting for a phone call, I ended up wasted days and days of time (sitting in court and waiting on continuances), ~$2,000 , my license was on hold for a year and the worst part?

If you Google my name, my picture still pops up in the local paper along with the DUI charge even though it was dismissed! My lawyer said he can expunge the charges ($$), but I know that won't do a lick of good at scrubbing the internet of every instance I mentioned with this charge.


The part that annoys me the most is that after I woke up and appeared fine, I should have been allowed to go on home. Even more so after the first negative breathalyzer test, instead, the police decided they were not leaving without me."

Actually I said all of this just to continue the chase hate. But have no doubt, they programmed their algorithms and macros to rearrange deposits/withdraws done on the same day so that it maximizes their chance to profit.

I.E. i check my account at noon and see I have $100.00. I run 3 errands that cost $50.00 each followed by a last errand that costs $125.00. this should result and 3 $50 withdrawals fallen by $125 withdrawal that results in being overdrawn by $50 aka -$50.00 balance AND an overdraft charge.

However, at the end of the day, the bank will rearrange all of this so that $125.00 draft hit first making you already overdrafts for each of the other transactions. If each OD fee was $25.00, this would mean you are now at -$125.00 instead of just -$50.00"

NorthCarolina,ffaexb9,t3_esi873,1579734098.0,"FYI: NC water law is soo bad, here is how you get around polluting waterways:

If you have a pipe that drains into *any* waterway, a sample of the discharge must be first sent and analyzed before permission is granted. Then the pipe & water must be tested & inspected at specific intervals and must meet certain criteria with major harsh penalties for any infractions.

The workaround?

**If you cut the pipe so that the tip ends in the riverbank and not water, none of the above is true and you can put whatever you want into that pipe and not be liable for anyting it does to the waterway!** 

**Obviously, anyting put into the ground of a river bank is going to wind up in the river!! Yet, this law stands and allows for any company to pollute our water without any risk or liability!!**

I was listening to representatives in the state congress ask environmental law experts and scientists about this law and that pipe scenario in the riverbank and they flat-out said, 

""Pipe tip in the water = tens of thousands of dollars in initial and regular testing required and risk of liability.""

""Cut that same pipe to half a foot shorter so that it doesn't poke out up the river bank and instead ends in the riverbank half a foot before the water and the company can put whatever they want in that pipe without ever having to submit for initial testing, allow later testing, or be liable for any pollutants or contaminants found in the water just downstream from their pipe."""

I think the biggest problem people have is that until they are 18 or 21, they can rely on school entirely to provide these situations where you can find out someone has shared interest and become friends. So many people have friends in school and then as they age and drift apart, they don't have that common factor of school to facilitate the initial difficult hump I'm making a friend."

Two of my close friends in college were of the shy and dorky type that had not experienced their first love and heartbreak yet and when I introduced my girlfriend to all of my social circles, she quickly became one of the guys and was at all of the events and friends with everybody.

Well, the friend circles merged so well that when we split, my two buddies started interpreting anytime she was being nice into them having a possible chance of a romance, so I would often get lied to about what was going on....

For example, during the course of a Friday I would ask everybody what they were up to that night with everybody's response being nothing in particular or busy studying etc. Well, there are numerous times I found out that they told me that because my ex was going to be at the hangout and they didn't want to be awkward. They both apologized to me about six months after The Break-Up when they realized they were being manipulated. No lie though, those months right after we broke up when I was already heartbroken and going crazy, dealing with my closest friends lying to me just to hang out with my ex really really really hurt."

I would say this is the case for probably 80% of the classes and medical and dental school and I would imagine it's true for the other Health professions schools as well. Of course, if a course is being taught by a new professor, they are likely to introduce new material, but often I would see the same questions from the old test indicating that the professors handed off their files to the new professor as well lol. 

at first, I was truly surprised at this because of how difficult and important medical training is as well as how cutthroat competitive it is to get in. However, I have a feeling this is more common in medical schools because getting good grades on tests alone is not enough to be successful. After the first year, almost every course has a Hands-On lab and practicals you are timed and graded on. In addition, as you progress in medical school, you transition from all classes to eventually all clinics."

AskReddit,fevojaf,t1_fev75lv,1579399712.0,"Well, I agree with what you're saying and successful crossovers are definitely more rare these days. However, I think this is more due to significant blending of the popular music styles these days as well.

Old Town Road is a good example. The rise of ""Bro-Country"" is similar in that it tends to be hip-hop for whites. Even pop, country and other styles have been pulling from EDM (more so 2010-2015) and other genres resulting in hit songs that soar to the top of the charts, **but which charts?**

Pop stars definitely still change up their steez in attempts to remain relevant/popular. Madonna is the classic and extreme version of this. It can be argued that the classic accusation of an artist ""selling out"" fits this mold, but artist often sell out at the peak of their careers by completely abandoning the style/music they originally played . Instead, their next release is often entirely composed of songs that are simple variations of the one that they hit big with.

Sugar Ray is a good example of this type of ""selling out."" Their album ""Floored"" consisted of the extreme up-tempo punk and thrash that populated their previous albums, with the exception being a song the label had to heavily persuade them to include: The 1997 megahit ""Fly."" In an attempt to capitalize on the huge success of flying, they rushed their next album as well as made sure it featured NO SONGS in their previous heavy/speed style.

To me, it's pretty clear that Swift's previous album Reputation was an attempt to cash in on her snake-like image while simultaneously guilt tripping and shaming the very folks who called out her slithering style.

Is there a less than stellar roll out and tour for reputation, I'm pretty sure she released juvenile and bubblegum record out now in an attempt to hook another generation of young girls who need a ""good role model like her"" to look up to (barf)."

Z*Wondering how this would play out in court if this was your lawsuit is exactly why everyone says you have to get a lawyer!** I had a lawyer that delayed a case once simply because the normal judge was out that day and the replacement was a huge asshole, making it less likely to end in a desirable result for me. 

I think people often forget that lawyers spend a ton of time at court, that judges are almost always ex- lawyers and the same is true for the prosecutors and DAs. Naturally, this means that the lawyers know the judges who know the prosecutors who know the lawyers.

**It cannot be overstated how much these relationships can make/break a case/trial/decision.** If you're on the hook for something that could result in you being locked in a cell for the rest of your life and you have the means, you're going to want to hire the lawyer who new the judge in law school, not the lawyer who helped his ex wife winn alimony against him.
