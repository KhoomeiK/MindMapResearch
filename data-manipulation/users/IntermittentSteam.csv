learnpython,ffbqljr,t3_esqxj8,1579778749.0,"This is because of [PEP420 Implicit Namespace Packages](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/),
which was adopted into Python 3.3+

Note near the bottom, the PEP states:

> If a developer knows that her package will never be a portion of a namespace package, then there is a performance advantage to it being a regular package (with an `__init__.py`). Creation and loading of a regular package can take place immediately when it is located along the path. With namespace packages, all entries in the path must be scanned before the package is created.

So you're taking a performance hit. The differences between an Implicit Namespace Package and a normal package otherwise seem fairly inconsequential in normal use, but probably are worth learning if you're going to use them."

UpliftingNews,fcow50k,t1_fcorzlc,1577843204.0,"How about 10,000 employees?

Company A:

* 1 x $2,000,000
* 9 x $50,000
* 990 x $40,000
* 8,000 x $30,001
* 1,000 x $30,000

Top 10% = $40,250  
Bottom 10% = $30,000  
So a factor of 1.3 between bottom 10% and top 10%

And company B:

* 1  x $60,000
* 9 x $55,000
* 990 x $40,096
* 8,000 between $31,000 and 40,000
* 1,000 x $30,000

Again, we have a much more pronounced wage divide in Company A than in Company B, but given this way of reporting they look identical.

**edit** The thing about using the average of the top/bottom 10% is that it actually makes it easier to hide if you have a lot of employees by just ensuring that there is an income divide in that top 10%.

Watch what happens if we assume the minimum anyone can make is $30,000 and that our board wants to keep our wage multiplier at exactly 2 while still paying our CEO the absolute most possible no matter how ridiculous:

10 employees:

* 1 x $60,000
* 8 between
* 1 x $30,000

100 employees:

* 1 x $330,000
* 99 x $30,000

1000 employees:

* 1 x $3,030,000
* 999 x $30,000


While these are absurdly contrived, they show the flaw. A system like this is ripe for abuse. Any company will decide what they want their results to look like and then figure out who to fire or promote in order to achieve those numbers in the reports. 

You need more data to have any idea what's going on. Knowing the highest and lowest individual compensations would be a very helpful additional data point. Or including the range in each 10% block (do the bottom 10% all make essentially the same amount? Do the top 10% have a vastly larger spread?)"
UpliftingNews,fcobhyz,t1_fcn5mwc,1577828187.0,"A simple average (assuming arithmetic mean) is not great here without at least one more data point (e.g., standard deviation).

Here's an example company A:

* 1 x $2,000,000
* 9 x $50,000
* 80 x $35,000
* 10 x $30,000

Top 10% average is $205,000  
Bottom 10% average is $30,000  
So the top 10% is making about 7 times the bottom 10%

But very different from example company B:

* 1 x $225,000
* 4 x $210,000
* 5 x $197,000
* 80 between $39,000 and $196,000
* 1 x $38,000
* 2 x $33,000
* 7 x $28,000

Which has the same top 10% average, bottom 10% average, and the multiple difference is thus the same.

But in company B, wages are more evenly distributed from the bottom all the way up—contrasting the drastic wage divide seen in company A."
