Practices with certain focuses will state as much. Veteran treatments for veterans and such. Mental health facilities targeting women reach out to women specifically because they specialize in particular issues and want women to know they are in a safe space.

TwilightZone,ff71lav,t3_ern3px,1579639309.0,"Interesting question, and it is hard to pin down when looking at all the episodes. However, in many episodes where the main character dies, interacts with an angel/devil/death/dead person, or has already been dead the whole time, I feel as though the Twilight Zone is the barrier between life and afterlife. It’s where our mind has to pass through to accept that we are dead so as to embrace the idea that we are going to another plane of existence."
