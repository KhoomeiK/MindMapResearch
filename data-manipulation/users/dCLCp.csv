Like the above commenter said: It's weird, but weird things can be weird without being degenerate. I can even throw out a perfectly plausible evolutionary psych explanation for this behavior. Many animals can detect disease by smell and it is often a way of selecting against sick offspring to smell for disease. This lady is probably just unconsciously experiencing an evolutionary survival trait. In that light it's not even that weird. The weird thing is the immediate tendency to presume everything weird is a fetish.

Which brings me to the second wrong: it isn't right that society treats dudes like pedophiles for doing weird things with kids. Especially their own kids when it isn't explicitly sexual or even harmful (such as smelling their feet). Anyways both of these things will be lost in the cultural hullabaloo.

3d6,fer9q8h,t1_fer767r,1579351493.0,"So small races can use those weapons, but if they have the ""heavy"" property they get disadvantage. However, it looks like only great weapon master specifically says it must be a heavy weapon for the second part of the feat. The first part merely states a melee weapon. Polearm Master doesn't say anything about the weapon having the heavy property. So both feats are applicable with a staff. Although part of the charm of PaM is whacking bad guys 10 feet away for having the audacity to approach. An alternative to this build which is still powerful but I found less charming is the half orc instead of the halfling. The relentless endurance synergizes well with the rest of the build, but it also felt kind of cliche."
3d6,fer6rhz,t3_eqe98f,1579350529.0,"I would ordinarily say do life cleric 1/moon druid X but in this case it depends on if your draconic sorcerer took arcana as a skill. If they didn't, why not try this build which will be only slightly less good at healing than the life cleric - and will give you tanking options when you run out of beast shapes because druid does not give you very good armor class and if you don't get short rests you don't have infinite HP:

Arcana cleric 1/Moon Druid X
Pick up booming blade or green flame blade as one of your ""wizard"" cleric cantrips and later on pick up shillelagh. Now you'll be able to bonus action something that is SAD (single attribute dependent) your shillelagh, AND attack with something that scales with your level with GFB/BB. Plus you get heavy armor proficiency that you can use with dragon scale armor. If you rely solely on being a moon druid your AC is going to be below 15 for most of the game. They get the wild shape HP but those forms all have low AC until around 10th level when you get elementals. You'll still get those with a 1 level dip into cleric but you can maybe mitigate some damage until then with some sort of scale male (maybe not dragon but some other creature)."
3d6,fer37an,t3_eqbm40,1579349221.0,"Zealot barbarian is the answer unless you want this player character's career to be short. Many of the other builds in here can deal out damage (although mechanically no one comes close to reckless attack barbs - there have been studies, check out some of the research). But no other character can take the damage as well as it deals it out as the zealot barbarian. Personally I like the idea of a stout halfling zealot barbarian. They get to reroll ones and you can literally hurl them into battle kamikaze style if they have a bigger ally. After that give them some of the regular feats you would with any other barbarian, like PaM or GWM. Throw in Charger or Lucky depending on how you want to play them and you will have a swirling dervish, a Tasmanian devil of destruction that is hard to kill and easy to revive. Alternatively you could dual class into, say, a Samurai or depending on how you want to play it some other fighting character, and you'll get an extra feat and some of the fighter goodies."

stopdrinking,femb33n,t3_epx7a8,1579246737.0,"I think it is possible but unnecessary. I think the reason why people white knuckle it is they haven't had the epiphany yet where alcohol is no longer a treat or a reward or even something desirable. After you have the epiphany, which is why the podcasts, and meetings, and mindfulness, and 12 steps are useful - to generate that epiphany, after you realize alcohol is kind of a bummer in general and you don't need it, you are 99% free and there's no more white knuckling until very specific triggers happen like when you are super relaxed and forget all the information you have learned about why alcohol is not something you should want. 

But is it possible to skip the meetings and the chatrooms and the therapy and still stay sober without generating an epiphany? Yup. Those people are called dry drunks. And hopefully they can get back to the business of figuring out what their real relationship with alcohol is rather than just trying to stay sober because ""that's what they are supposed to do"" or whatever. I think it is very important that people have a real sincere look into their life, not just about alcohol but everything, so they can actually lead a mindful life rather than just going through the motions. But dealing with alcoholism is a very important first step towards that for a lot of people."
DnD,fed0aig,t1_febwq1t,1578992255.0,"It is kinda my favorite thing because while the cleric multiclass is less restrictive and is more front loaded, neither the wizard nor the cleric get very many ""short rest"" powers. But now I have extra flavor, boatloads of extra HP (at least for early levels while it is very much in short supply), short rest powers, more cantrips, more spells etc etc. It is of course still fairly MAD but in the early game which is where this build excels I think, you have some very decent abilities. If I had it do over again though I would have chosen war wizard over abjuration. The war wizard abilities help more than the abjuration ward throughout the game. I can tell already the abjuration ward is nice but it won't be as effective or as useful as arcane deflection AND tactical wit. Those are just so much nicer than my measly 7 extra HP. I might also put in a 1lvl dip of cleric later too either in grave or life."
DnD,fe9o9c5,t3_enu0v7,1578939906.0,My plan is to be the tank for my group as well. I am an Aarakocra moon druid 2/abjurer wizard 2. In retrospect I could have made some better choices with cantrips and stat array but despite the madness of the build and my suboptimal choices I am having a lot of fun!!! My character can cast mage armor and use that while in beast shape. So my ac for the giant spider is 16. But I also have the arcane ward to eat some damage too. In another level I'll have mirror image to absorb attacks like you too.

2) Give until it stops feeling good and then don't give any more. You are not a machine.

3) you deserve to be treated like a human being with needs and limits. Find ways to express that comfortably for yourself and your players.

 Alright, now for the proactive long term stuff.

4) Commit time towards practicing improv. Any way you like. Whether it be just playing improv training games ([http://improvencyclopedia.org/categories/Solo.html](http://improvencyclopedia.org/categories/Solo.html)) with yourself training yourself to think quickly and being able to make up things on the fly THAT WORK or practicing voices or whatever you can find in researching for yourself: Practice improv.  

5) As best as you can keep track of how much time you spend prepping for each segment or module. Record a session or two (with your players permission of course). Now attempt to figure out which parts of your prepping got you the most bang for your buck. If you spent 4 hours prepping something and you don't get to use it, that doesn't mean it was a waste. BUT if you spent 30 minutes or 5 minutes or hell even improv'd something and it kept the party busy and happy for the whole session that is \*gold\*. When you find gold like that brainstorm stuff \*like\* that and reskin it. Have a few flavors of easy fun time sitting around for days when work gets in the way. You'll know you can pull that card out of your sleeve if you need to, plus you'll still have that stuff you spent 8 hours researching when the players are ready (or not!)

For example it's obvious that Chinaski is Bukowski, but when the author is examining himself through this lens is it critical, is he demonstrating to the reader these qualities so the reader might criticize those qualities and decide to be a better person? Or is it moral, is Bukowski earnestly trying to find out what is right or wrong simply by creating this thought experiment of himself to explore the things he wasn't crazy enough to try himself? Or is it a red herring so Bukowski can distract his readers from his real intentions and explore other things in the background while you are chasing after this version of his narrative that is pure fiction. Or is it a simply vanity and Bukowski actually believed the things he had Chinaski saying and doing? I don't really think it's possible to know.

Foodforthought,fdk003d,t1_fdjxual,1578492613.0,"I think you are missing a key element which is things \*are\* being exposed now where before nobody was paying attention, no one was capturing the evil things these groups were doing and distributing the info. There is no reason at all not to suspect that everything evil that is happening now was happening before - it just was going beneath the nonexistent radar. If a cop killed a person of color a hundred years ago if it wasn't explicitly legal it was implicitly legal and may not have ever even reached more than a few pairs of eyes and ears. Now, whether or not every life matters, every life is accounted for. There are cameras every where. There are phones every where. What once may have been a quiet murder, or a series of quiet murders by a modestly clever but evil person, has become a single bright streak of violence because the evil person knows they only have one shot and after that everyone will know who they are and they don't get to do evil things any more. This element you are missing - that evil is being exposed - is the element that is filling you with alarm. The evil always existed. It hasn't multiplied, it has merely been exposed and can now be nullified. There is no reason nor real capacity to measure whether things are getting worse because we still do not, nor will we ever know, just how bad things really are. Humans are fallible creatures after all. But in the fullness of time as things become clearer, we are finding out the roots of evil, they are being exposed suppressed and extinguished. 

In the end, as I indicated before, there are more good people than bad. And the only difference is the tools available to the good and evil people. But for the most part those tools are distributed fairly evenly. Donald Trump for example has the same Twitter account that everyone else has. Some random Swedish girl had the same amplification to her voice as the President of the United States. Now how many random Swedish girls, and random Polish boys and random Zimbabweans and Americans who simply want to see a safer, happier, more just world? Innumerable. Likely billions. And how many sociopaths? Many many many fewer. We have the same tools and greater numbers and things can absolutely get better."

There are 'meet up' type apps where you can meet people with similar interests. If you have any hobbies that's another outlet. I have DND friends that I see semi regularly that help feed my social needs. Really it all depends on what you are interested in. Some things may take  awhile or a different kind of effort than you are used to applying. You said you do the yoga thing. It may take a while before you make friends there to where it's more than pleasantries. You may also need to arrange to do things before or after the yoga thing since it's a physical activity.

2) It's not that bad. Yes there are new tools and new frustrating problems. We are learning how to use them and soon things will get much better (see 1) but in the meanwhile, what really have we lost?
