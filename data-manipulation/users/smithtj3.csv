excel,fezmuph,t3_eqiiof,1579459130.0,"Try this:
In my example cell A1 is the counter cell, B1 is the reference cell, and C1 is the cell containing the new listing date.
 
A1:

    =IF(B1=C1,A1+1,A1)

B1:

    =C1

C1:

Type the date of the listing in this cell. Everytime you enter a new date, the counter in A1 should increment by 1.

You'll need to enable iterative calculations in Excel's Formula settings as well."
excel,fet8jmh,t3_eqiiof,1579372766.0,So you want a cell with a counter that increases by 1 every time the date in another cell is changed?
todayilearned,fe448h6,t1_fe41nd5,1578855665.0,This doesn't seem right but I don't know enough about mouse brains to refute it.

todayilearned,fdlb4fm,t1_fdl9nyw,1578520263.0,"I think this is such a cool concept about language though. We tend to think that language is dependent on phonetics but in reality you can have meaning for words and still have no fucking clue how to pronounce them. Conversely, you can pronounce a word correctly and have no clue as to what it could mean."
todayilearned,fdkxqwn,t1_fdkwudh,1578513332.0,Written language can be learned both ways. I'm sure you've had the experience of hearing a word for the first time long after you'd encountered it in writing. You probably had developed meaning for that word but didn't realize until hearing it later that you'd been pronouncing it incorrectly in your head that whole time.

starcitizen,fcymn6g,t3_ejk03z,1578082852.0,"A lot of this is because back then your game play options were crash into port olisar or go fight other players at security post koreah. That was it. If you enjoyed dog fighting, things were good. 

Now the places to go has exploded and player density has decreased dramatically as a result. Once the size of each instance starts increasing, much of the mayhem will return.

As for the flight model and weapon mechanics, every update has had pros and cons and things will continue to change as the game develops."

Columbus,fco3uds,t1_fcnuiv2,1577823563.0,"I think the point is more about the decisions made in the moment vs decisions made with hindsight. Police have to make decisions in the moment no matter what. When we're watching video of it we can all speculate about how the officer should have done X or y instead of z, but we aren't having to make a snap decision in a stressful moment.

We're missing a lot of context but it seems like the person filming is trying to antagonize the officers. We've got people trying to rush past the officers with children. This dude comes running in and doesn't immediately comply with officer direction. There is a lot of passive non-compliance bordering on active non-compliance happening."

Ugh, this is why my unit has the rule of, ""If you can call for a medic, you don't need one"". Put your own TQ on, eliminate the threat, then we can talk about calling in a 9-Line."
