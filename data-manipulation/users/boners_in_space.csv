I feel like it keeps me more involved in the game. I definitely try to pick a corner out of the way and don't do a lot of distracting movements though.

Honestly, learning to play through most distractions is a skill too. Go out and play in a bar on nights when you don't have league and play through the gawkers and people standing around talking about how you shoot or opponents who deliberately shark you."

Whatever your opinion, that's just an awful way to state things.

Just reading some of the replies here, there is more than one way a victim could be considered as ""not cooperating"" and there is a very, very, VERY long list of reasons why someone (any rape victim, not just a woman) would not want to cooperate beyond ""they don't care about anyone else""."

Whether you qualify ""tighty"" as size or shape, either one should still come before ""whitey"" which is the color."
