BiggerThanYouThought,ffndwns,t3_eu9qiw,1580064654.0,I hope she found the money she dropped after this.
lookatmydog,ffk642j,t3_eu2o91,1580017105.0,What did humans do to deserve dogs?
WTF,ffjy73n,t1_ffjy5tk,1580010213.0,I second this thought
Rabbits,fff4l76,t1_ffeas0g,1579875547.0,A little of both. Missy is pretty old and small.
Rabbits,ffdj0ja,t1_ffd6utu,1579821891.0,I try to remain aware of that. They think and react very different from predator house pets and I do my best to respect it.
Rabbits,ffdbq32,t1_ffd170y,1579817466.0,Thank you! She’s so sweet and like to cuddle the bun.
Rabbits,ffcy4oe,t1_ffctki8,1579809674.0,She mostly wants to just lay on the bed. Sometimes she licks the bun.
Rabbits,ffcph22,t3_eswqiq,1579804436.0,I also want to know the answer to this.
Rabbits,ffcpa31,t1_ffcp2vj,1579804308.0,"I understand. It’s a helpful observation I haven’t considered before. As I said, this is a first bun so I’m not super familiar on how they react."
Rabbits,ffcowy6,t1_ffc40dt,1579804082.0,Oh. That’s very helpful. I didn’t know that. Thank you. :)
Rabbits,ffcov7k,t1_ffbx35m,1579804053.0,I wasn’t sure if the sinking was fear or acceptance. Thank you!
Rabbits,ffcottd,t1_ffbuvyj,1579804031.0,She was nibbling my hair earlier. She really seems to like the spot on the back of the couch. :)
Rabbits,ffcor2y,t1_ffbuph4,1579803987.0,She does a little flinch sometimes. I wasn’t sure if it was too bad. Thank you! :D
Rabbits,ffbeaau,t1_ffbe0gd,1579761603.0,Thank you. :) she’s a sweet girl.

WTF,ff3z9gf,t1_ff3ymjz,1579552106.0,I know some lizards can lose their tails and the tail will keep moving for a while after being disconnected. Maybe that’s kinda what’s going on here.
interestingasfuck,ff3s485,t3_erhutm,1579547658.0,Holy fuck. Yes
insanepeoplefacebook,ff3s2mp,t3_erhuzg,1579547630.0,I actually agree with the commenter. Specifying boy/girl toys kinda sexualizes kids at an age where it literally doesn’t matter.
Rabbits,ff2yuoz,t1_ff2i9s6,1579528986.0,"Her mother was a giant of some kind, dad was a mystery. I have no idea what she is."

memes,fev0lcd,t3_eqo601,1579391823.0,I had three different people let me cut in front of them at once. The stars rarely align in such a fashion.

Showerthoughts,feo54pp,t3_eq5ikc,1579295257.0,Humans in general are invasive. They destroy the natural environment and wipe out the local plants and wildlife. They’re the worst. :(

tattoos,fen527x,t1_fen4wz8,1579277136.0,"I’d almost figure that wouldn’t be as bad, depending on your weight. I assume the more fat and skin, the less painful. Not always so, I guess."

tattoos,fen1eih,t3_eq1kqy,1579274810.0,Was it the most painful thing ever?! Throat tattoos are a sign of a real bad ass.
insanepeoplefacebook,femzw6s,t3_eq1jxv,1579273818.0,I actually don’t this is insane at all. It’s calling attention to the horse shit quality care that the elderly receive. The absurdity is the point.
cats,felvbj5,t3_epukyi,1579231835.0,"Cats can see several shades of color. 
It’s possible the hair color can throw an animal off. I’ve known pets that lose their shit if someone wears a mask or hat. Usually if they can smell you, it calms down."
TIHI,fel2zx7,t1_fektlam,1579212950.0,Yup. They said as long as it doesn’t get any worse it’s fine.

awfuleverything,fehw4cb,t3_ep8yv4,1579125041.0,She looks like Aughra from The Dark Crystal.
cats,fehvv0m,t3_ep8z1d,1579124895.0,"It’s probably a skin tag, but could be something worse. It’s never a bad idea to get stuff like that checked out, but I wouldn’t be too worried."

cats,fdns3v7,t1_fdnrys0,1578591713.0,"I see you mentioned waking the cat. It can be tough to get a cat used to a harness and leash, but it’s totally possible. Just make sure you get a harness designed for cats because they can slip out of the dog harnesses quite easily."
cats,fdnrzwv,t1_fdnq202,1578591649.0,Use logic. Doors open. That’s their purpose. An animal can slip out.
cats,fdnrtts,t1_fdnrjq5,1578591554.0,"It almost sounds like it’s not a good home for her, but it’s hard to say with so few details. I don’t personally think animals do well locked up and they need frequent socialization with other animals or humans. I hope you can figure something out."

cats,fdnr0xr,t1_fdnp0zz,1578591161.0,"Cats need lots of space to roam and explore. Room to climb and get up high. Does she not have that? 
I understand it’s not your control."
