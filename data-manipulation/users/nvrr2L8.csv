ADHD,ffeyygr,t3_et6ygu,1579870864.0,"This is such a great question and I am LOVING reading all the responses!!

I had an ADHD positive experience recently due to my STRONG EMOTIONAL REACTIONS! Usually one of the hardest parts about having ADHD, right? But last month when a coworker told me she was pregnant and I jumped up and down with excitement basically screaming and she started cracking up told me that she was more excited to tell me than anyone else we work with because she knew I would freak out. 

When I am happy, I am *so* happy, and it made me feel so great knowing that other people love that about me."
