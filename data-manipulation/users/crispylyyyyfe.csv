Edit- maybe not an allergic reaction to the pads/tampons since it's right before your cycle (my bad) sorry your going through this girl. I'm sure its aggravating. I hope you get some relief soon <3"

Periods,ff7gxbd,t3_erzuct,1579649288.0,"I am so sorry. I totally feel your pain. This is exactly what I have to deal with every month. I also have to call out of work the first 2 days. I have an ultrasound scheduled in Feb so hopefully they can figure out why my period is so awful. I will do ANYTHING, even surgery to fix this issue. I don't want to take birth control either (had my tubes tied in August)

I hope my babe will start sleeping through the night again because he spoiled me those first few weeks. Thank goodness for coffee or I dont know how I would survive through out the day."
sleeptrain,ff6rou2,t3_ervdbe,1579633472.0,"I have a 5.5mo old & he wakes up around 2AM every night for a bottle. He is a rather large chunk (10lbs at birth) so I know he's not starving. We started him on baby oatmeal for breakfast & introducing veggie baby food for dinner. Starting today he will begin to eat baby food for lunch as well. I'm genuinely asking this question because I had no idea, but when is it okay to start feeding babies ""human food"" like mashed potatoes & stuff like that? I really had no clue it was safe to give a 6mo old peanut butter & yogurt. 

He slept ALL night from 6pm-6am starting at 8 weeks up until 4mo & now he is waking up every night around 2AM for a bottle. I don't get it. I'm desperate to figure something out so he can sleep all night again. He got the flu when he was 4 months old & it seems like that totally messed up him sleeping throughout the night."

1200isplenty,ff3n3vs,t3_erfhv5,1579544591.0,"Same here! I ate like shit this weekend and I'm definitely paying for it. My stomach has been messed up & I just feel gross. I've been on a strict healthy/1200cal diet since October and I have been feeling so great!

I just had a moment of weakness this weekend (thanks pms) and I'm back to eating healthy starting today."
Periods,ff3cssz,t3_erf5hr,1579538573.0,"I had the paragard IUD for almost a year & it was the absolute worse year of my life. My periods were super heavy & long. My cramps were unbearable. I became anemic. I would feel weak & pass out randomly. The moment I had it removed I instantly felt better.  Some people I guess can't tolerate it. 

I started taking the pill again after I had the paragard removed. The pill helped regulate my periods & also became shorter. I felt like I could live my life again. I also wasn't so emotional/hormonal during that time of the month.

Fast forward today- I had my tubes tied back in August after my DS2 was born & now I'm back to having horrible, heavy periods. My cramps are so painful I have to call out of work the first 2 days on my period. I'm not taking the bill, nor do I want to just bc I don't want to start taking hormones again. I'm suppose to have an ultrasound in Feb to hopefully figure out my issues & hopefully have surgery to get this resolved bc my period is interfering with my life.

Have you considered the pill? That seems to pretty much be the treatment for heavy/painful periods."
