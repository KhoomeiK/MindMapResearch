I guess learn to read yourself lmao and to engage with someone and say THEY dragged it out lmao why are em fans so weird?  Get a life lmao tf em stans are hilarious

What I find laughable was still successful? Lol I said him owning the later part of the decade was laughable. If someone told me DMX owned the early 2000’s, I would find that laughable, even tho his albums sold very well..... so yeah. Me saying what I said doesn’t somehow mean what you think it means, I’m not sure why you thought it did...."

Em owned the 2000’s? That’s adorable"

Music,ffuk8wz,t1_ffujzol,1580243718.0,"Lol again, I take it you weren’t watching much MTV or BET in the late 90’s early 2000’s. Key word being relevancy lmao he’s pretty relevant nowadays..... sorry I guess? Lol Eminem fan girls are the weirdest.

Fewer people knowing who he was in the group? What? He was lil Wayne in the group lmao 

Either way, you said nobody from the generation is making albums that people are checking for, something along those lines. That’s completely false and now you’ve had to change the premise of your argument... good job."

He’s from that generation and still releasing albums that people care about it, or whatever you said nobody from the generation is still doing. Just pointing that out.

worldnews,ff73acf,t1_ff72az2,1579640262.0,"Yeah I’m still not buying it. Why should it be a lot harder? I went from making 25k a year just 2 years ago to 75k a year. It wasn’t “very hard.”  And it makes sense that going from 10k and year to 60k would be harder than 200k to 300k, because if you’re making 200k a year, you probably have a valuable skill set, more so than the person making 10k.... it kind of sounds like you just expect people to get easy money for little effort. And it still sounds like a tax audit has no bearing on your earning potential. And getting to that 100k likely took hard work, whether it be manual labor or studying or whatever it might be, the 10k job, probably not so much so yeah, obviously you’re going have to put in some extra effort to increase that...."
worldnews,ff6v42f,t1_ff60c2j,1579635506.0,"How do you figure that?


To be completely honest, what you just said doesn’t really make any sense.... if you have a simple tax return, you’re clearly putting in less effort to complete it than someone who has a complicated and complex return to file.....

A majority of audits are correspondence audits, it’s not like they take much effort. not much more than giving them copies of documents you used to file the return. I just don’t see how you’re putting in more effort to get less or the same result as someone else..."
worldnews,ff5d5ok,t1_ff4lcgl,1579587963.0,So I’m curious. Are you under the impression that being audited means you’re prevented from making more money the next year or? I don’t really see how being audited is a hindrance to your ability to make more money or how it means the system is “rigged” against you..
