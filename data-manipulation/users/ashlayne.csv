gravityfalls,ffmdgpz,t1_ffmd19i,1580052899.0,Homeslice asking the real question.
AmItheAsshole,ffgbx5b,t1_ffgbbb2,1579902842.0,"I thought that was the case, but didn't want to speak out of my ass."
videogames,ffg0ndf,t3_etc7ul,1579895901.0,"Done. It is a bit lengthy for most people's attention spans, and I found myself looking at the clock during the T test wondering if I was going to finish it before I had to leave work. If you ever do something like this again, I highly recommend a progress bar based on each test, not just the point you're at. (E.g., the the entire time I was on the T test it said I was 73% complete, and on the letter test it said 86%. I may have those numbers wrong, but they didn't change.)"
AmItheAsshole,fffzmxl,t1_fffwltv,1579895279.0,"At his last job, my brother worked with ACA enrollments for various states, including Massachusetts. He told me Mass Health (sp?) was one of the best configured systems in the nation, and I think even Kynect (Kentucky's version -- I live in KY, which is why it came up) was based on Mass Health. Kynect became the most widely acclaimed ACA-originated state medicaid enrollment system before that idiot Bevin dismantled it and killed it slowly.

(To my understanding, while Mass health handled ACA, it was not originally an ACA-based system, which is the distinction I was going for.)"
AmItheAsshole,fffqkau,t3_et9b7g,1579889641.0,"NTA. I've not been pregnant (I had my doubts when I was younger that I even could, and at 37 I'm not willing to try any more for various reasons), but I'm pretty sure your friend needs to get over her pity party. I get that it sucks to miscarry and so on, don't get me wrong. It also sucks to not be able to get pregnant, but that never stopped umpteen million coworkers at my last job asking me when my turn was after three of the ladies at Central Office with me got pregnant. \*That\* situation got to the point where I fell back on the ""I can't"" excuse just to get them to shut up about it in relation to me. (I didn't mind talking with/about my pregnant coworkers.)"
IDontWorkHereLady,ffdzewi,t3_et1hjj,1579832749.0,"Play Karen games, get Karen prizes. (I think I'm going to start using that more frequently in these stories.)"
AmItheAsshole,ffdt00a,t3_estxok,1579828174.0,"NTA. Turn off the line's data, throttle it, or put parental controls and limits on it. If you can't do it online customer service can. But more importantly get it off your account asap. Naturally give him time to port the number to his name if you can, but during the interim time disable data or throttle."
religion,ffcwkn0,t3_eswzor,1579808771.0,Done. Interesting. Would love to see results if you're willing to post.
networking,ffcgnan,t1_ffcdqtb,1579799046.0,"I think you meant 2 /25s, as /23 is a larger network."
aww,ff7ffgg,t1_ff68nb6,1579648306.0,My cat somehow senses one coming (maybe my body tensing up) and will run out of the room right before I sneeze. I think he doesn't like loud noises.
AskReddit,ff69hxf,t1_ff43dbw,1579622273.0,"Use the time to actually learn Excel and improve your general employability skills? There are a lot of free resources available online for learning Excel well, or even just enough to do basic formulas and such (which a lot of people don't want to take the time to learn)."
AmItheAsshole,ff5ttl9,t1_ff4qwe8,1579609996.0,"I would be careful then; he may not be directly allergic, but mushrooms may give him gastro issues. Source: I'm allergic to penicillin (related to amoxicillin) and get a sour stomach when I eat too many mushrooms, sometimes to the point of stomach cramps and throwing up."
AmItheAsshole,ff3vyyv,t3_ergc1h,1579550048.0,"NTA. I was in the very fortunate position of being an only child, but given that I lost my dad at 11 and my mom took on 2 and a half jobs just to make ends meet, I have a feeling that if I'd had a little sibling that woulda been me. I've also recently learned that forcing an older sibling to essentially raise their younger ones is a form of child abuse and neglect. I feel like it's no big loss to be booted from the family group chat, etc."
