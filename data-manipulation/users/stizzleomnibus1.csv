There's also a version of it that stops trilling and turns into a normal meow at the end. I'm pretty sure that noise is just them meowing with their purr-motor engaged. When you startle a cat it just sort of slips out. Like their throat isn't in purr-mode and some air squeezes out as if to meow."

However, if you're taking 20 turns to beat the early missions (which should only take 1-3, 5 at most), you're playing the game wrong. That's not a knock; it's not always intuitive just how a game was intended to be played or what is a good strategy. So, here's an FAQ that you can use for a few missions to try to get a feel for how the game ought to be played. Also, there's a HUGE stack of tips and tricks at the front of that guide.

AskReddit,fgfxnuq,t1_fgfp0lf,1580749852.0,"> [To be a mass tourist] is to spoil, by way of sheer ontology, the very unspoiledness you are there to experience. It is to impose yourself on places that in all noneconomic ways would be better, realer, without you. It is, in lines and gridlock and transaction after transaction, to confront a dimension of yourself that is as inescapable as it is painful: As a tourist, you become economically significant but existentially loathsome, an insect on a dead thing.

DepthHub,ffx2ixp,t1_ffw9wxp,1580316365.0,"I fell down the rabbit hole on this a few weeks ago, and I would strongly recommend digesting some of the massive wikipedia articles on this subject. The things that are widely accepted by scholars but known to casual adherents (like the liked comment) is astounding. Some great topics:

* The Pericope Adulterae, which contains maybe the most famous lines of Jesus (let he among you who is without sin cast the first stone). It's added the bible hundreds of years after Christ.
* Mark appears to be an original work (possibly even written by Mark), but Matthew and Luke are probably copied from Mark with the integration of a text called the Q source.
* The entire ending of Mark is a forgery. In various versions, Mark either ends abruptly or has a short or long section of non-original text added on.
* The Johannine Comma makes a strong, literal statement about the concept of the Trinity, but it's a latter-day insertion.

Even if we're working from the perspective that there is a God who sent Christ to us to save us from sin, it is factually incorrect that the bible that exists today is the true and unaltered word of God. It is the result of a LOT of editorial decisions over time (ones that we would call heretical if we made them today). Passages were inserted to influence certain debates, and even the translations are deliberately altered to bring about a certain understanding of Christianity."

LoMSE,ff631to,t3_erl5ag,1579617883.0,"I've done some work with this and I don't think it works the way that you think it does. Units appears to keep gaining experience forever, even if their level is capped out. Meaning that while a life warrior will max his level before an order warrior, they will both accumulate experience beyond level 10 that factors into how they can train.

I've been playing a lot with hacked custom game files that have infinite barter points, so I've started a bunch of ""trainers"" at level 10. Despite starting with ""max"" experience, when these characters come back to an area they've already trained they have more experience to give based on their additional adventures. That's why I said earlier that experience appears to be infinite for all heroes.

Now, if you're using this infinite barter point trick, you can play with different hero types from different faiths and see who can actually take the most starting experience (the game only lets you raise a hero to max level, so the ""highest ceiling"" question you're asking is relevant here). It seems like that Order warriors are pretty high (Lancelot even more so), Air mages as mentioned below, and I believe death thieves. I'm not 100% on that, but you if you're doing the infinite barter points trick you can just investigate that yourself.

In case you don't know it, here's the trick. I grabbed HxD for the hex editor. Also, you might have to search for the custldr folder on your computer because the GoG installer puts it in a totally different location than the install directory.

> The player must start creating a game with a custom champion, save the champion before starting the game and then Alt + Tab back to Windows. Open a hex editor and browse for the saved champions file which will be in the ""custldr"" directory under the lomse install directory. Find the byte 00000320 and type the hex 6A01 8000. This will give that custom champion over 800,000 points to spend building the starting party so that all of your starting parties' units can be gods. After the edit save the file Alt Tab back to the game and load the custom leader to see the change."
