Because of anti-death-penalty advocates eternally funding all their appeals. Death row only lasts so long and is so expensive because the same case has to be tried multiple times with increasingly ridiculous defenses.

> chemicals used don't always work correctly resulting in some horrific executions which sometimes lasted hours.

Also something introduced by anti-death-penalty advocates. No one failed to die with a guillotine. ""Humane"" executions are ridiculous.

> Not to mention the racial disparity. White men convicted of similar crimes would be more likely to get life in prison rather than death penalty compared to a black man in America.

This is the only fair point, but this problem is not isolated to death penalty cases. It's just a symptom of the larger racial issue in the justice system. It's not inherent to the death penalty.

> Also plenty of innocent people have been executed which should be enough of an injustice to end the conversation right here. 

No. The proportion of guilty to innocents is [96%-4%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/death-penalty-study-4-percent-defendants-innocent). For every innocent executed, 24 were guilty. That's pretty damn good.

> And finally giving the state the power to kills its citizens is extremely dangerous precedent and should be avoided rather than encouraged.

the state already has more than enough precedent for this. like seriously, what kind of delusional thinking is this? Cops kill people (innocent people even!) daily. This point is nonsense."

neoliberal,fc5k08s,t1_fc50vzn,1577459678.0,"> How am I as a cis-hetero male

It's not you they're trying to convince at all. TERFs, apart from hating trans people, are at their core anti-men (the radfem ones, at least). They spend most of their time being anti-trans because it's more popular, but you can see them slip that mask frequently (like, calling themselves MERFs instead, or saying all men are biologically rapists, etc). They're also anti sex workers (i.e. SWERFs), anti kinks of any sort (but especially BDSM) and anti sex positivity in general. The gendercrit sub is filled with examples of all of these, and for specifically anti-male stuff there's Female Dating Strategy (the horseshoe theory version of redpill), PinkPillFeminism, and a few others.

[This one is particularly glaring](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/dyu0qf/we_are_not_trans_exclusionary/)."
