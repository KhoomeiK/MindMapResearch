It is just so amazing and FUN!  Close quarter racing, side by side battles the ever-changing track that forces you to hunt for the new line lap after lap.  iRacing got me hooked on dirt oval to the point where I watched all six days of the 2020 Chili Bowl Nationals."
simracing,ffi3mln,t1_ffi3frz,1579964121.0,"Road racing is more about racing the track, it's you vs. the track.  Oval racing is more about racing other drivers, it's about close, sometimes beatin' and bangin' racing to gain or lose position.  I think both have their appeals, but I'm more of a dirt oval guy because it's oval racing but there's always more than one groove in a dirt track and you can have close racing and sometimes contact during a race without ruining a race."
