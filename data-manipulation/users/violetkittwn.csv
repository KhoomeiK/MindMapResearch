EatCheapAndHealthy,ffea7kd,t1_ffbxjoh,1579841020.0,The exact reason I try not to eat it with rice too much. I would be eating way too much rice and I don’t think that’s good for you!
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffea5dx,t1_ffbx643,1579840968.0,There are seaweed almond / nut snacks and i love them. They might be a little more filling.... but maybe more addicting.

tifu,ff8ylo2,t1_ff8xum1,1579700209.0,"True, particularly since minimum wage is oftentimes part-time work anyway.

To be honest, I used to work in customer service, but it wasnt as hands on as a server. I appreciated if customers tipped me for good service or because they really want to. But I’d rather the government/employers make the difference of a living wage rather than customers feel pressure to do so. Many customers dont make much more than me anyway, probably. I say this as a minimum wage earner and a customer.

And I know a common explanation for American tipping culture is the living wage, but that only explains the minimum wage earners (especially in some states), and it doesn’t really apply at all to the professional services (home improvement, salons, etc)."
tifu,ff8xq3b,t1_ff8tg1m,1579699480.0,"Where I live, minimum wage is about $15, and I feel tipping is still similar. Not the making up the difference idea necessarily, but more it being minimum wage thing and culture of tipping."
