AskReddit,fg0ydpq,t3_ew5y15,1580417455.0,"When I was a kid, we had ghosts in our office.   


So, my parents are very young, at least when compared to my friends' parents. The had my brother when my mother was 23 and dad was 25. Me, when they hit 28 and 30. Young people tend to be more scared or at least naïve of the natural world around them, mostly my mom.   
It was 1999. Mom and dad were cleaning the entire house. Mom had gotten this brand new, computer, the windows 98, and it was *very* smart and dandy. It had two great speakers and everything. it stood in the office, which was also one of the coldest rooms in our old house. I guess the computer could work as a heater, too.

Well. My mom was cleaning the office, and suddenly her blood ran cold. She could hear whispering voices. Tiny voices that she could not locate. 

This was the time *Riget,* known in the english-speaking world as *The Kingdom,* a danish horror series about the national hospital and directed by Lars Von Trier was rerun for the 2nd time. In it the spirits of the hospital talk and scream and naturally, my mother was frightened to death. And not only had they heard voices, the room was ice cold, a well-known indicator of scary monsters and mean spirits. 

My mom ran to my dad for help. He was scared too, of course, having heard the voices but had ignored it, hoping the ghosts would go away naturally. 

Not far from our house, two huge radio transmitter towers were broadcasting on shortwave and mediumwave to the rest of Europe, they had been doing so since the 1930's. The short- and medium wave transmissions are usually weather forecasts and marine information for ships far-out. 

One bright spring day, where me, my brother and mother weren't home, my father was sitting in the haunted office when he heard the voices. Now, the house was empty and quiet, so my father could suddenly hear what the voices were actually saying. And lo and behold, they were whispering the weather forecast ""*tonight in Kattegat, strong winds of 12 knots are expected. Storebælt will also be affected by strong winds.""* 

See, our brand new speakers were never turned off, and their wires were working as antenna. They picked up the shortwave radio, send out by the towers close to our house. So, the ghosts were meteroligists, dutifully reporting on the weather."

wholesomememes,ffxwncq,t3_evozya,1580333883.0,"I am so tired...tired of trying to prove to others how good I am. Trying forever to get some praise.  
I never got any critique at home, neither negative or positive. Anything I did was ""alright"" and the least my parents told me was ""improve next time"". 

This gave me a false sense of doing everything well all the time, as I never got any real critisism. Now, when I am in Uni, I am never told that I am doing well. I only get told what I can improve. I so deeply lack praise, it's unbearable. I really crave praise, and it feels so weird."

Because she war burried in a burrial mound, the clothes and hair were very well preserved, making it an exceptional found. It tells us a great deal about the clothing used in from 1700-500 BCE, amongst which her skirt stands out. It is made of hanging strings and so have been quite revealing. 

Her blouse was also quite revealing, as it ended above her naval. She has been quite a thing of beauty."
