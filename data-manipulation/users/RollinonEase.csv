datingoverforty,ffsirau,t3_euzlaj,1580182697.0,Why would it be shallow to approach someone based on looks? What other initial feature are you supposed to notice and get interested by?
datingoverforty,ffsicit,t3_euysv9,1580182415.0,Isn’t that what women call “foodie calls?” They go on a date solely for the free meal. https://www.newsweek.com/foodie-calls-women-dates-free-meals-personality-trait-1445156
datingoverforty,ffs2dmr,t1_ffrw6tt,1580171440.0,"Well, what you’re doing is asking him to choose to ignore 20 (or however many) people that he enjoys in exchange for just you. Hard to say with what you’ve offered. But, if he has a lot of fun bouncing things back and forth with that many people then you are essentially asking to replace that camaraderie all by yourself. Maybe you need a more introverted person that doesn’t have many social connections or need that stimulus. He sounds like an extrovert and you sound like an introvert. Inasmuch as it would be unrealistic for you to adopt his lifestyle it’s probably unrealistic for you to ask him to adopt yours.

You said it would be okay for him to choose not to be with you. But, why aren’t you making that choice seeing as you’re the one bothered? The fact is, friends like that take a lifetime to accumulate and good friends are hard to come by at this age. As long as there isn’t sexual activity I don’t really see what the problem is. You have a fundamental difference in how you approach relationships with this guy. So, accept it or move on."
dating,ffrtq93,t1_ffrsebk,1580165622.0,"Yeah, but at some point he/she is going to want to do something different. Unless you find another broke ass person to dat it’s going to cause problems very soon."
datingoverforty,ffrlne3,t1_ffqhb3z,1580160589.0,Of course they have other things in common. How do you think they get along if they aren’t currently having sex? Just because he’s had sex with them doesn’t mean nothing else is there. How do you think he got to have sex with them in the first place? It’s probably because they connected on an intellectual or emotional level first. Sex doesn’t negate that connection. You either trust him or you don’t. If he hasn’t given you a reason to not trust him then you should work on your insecurity.
datingoverforty,ffrl60q,t1_ffqo3ik,1580160296.0,"Honestly, most guys want to fuck most good looking women. It’s biological. Acting on, or otherwise trying to initiate that desire, is a totally different thing."
datingoverforty,ffrkh6x,t3_eum1r0,1580159881.0,Just because they didn’t burn bridges with exes doesn’t mean there’s something wrong. I think it’s complementary when someone is still friendly with exes. It shows maturity and character. You sound like you may be jealous or insecure.
ActualPublicFreakouts,ffrk6ct,t1_ffrjopy,1580159698.0,There you go again with name-calling. You don’t seem capable of having an intelligent discussion. I’ll wait for an adult to reply since I’m not really interested in your opinion to begin with. Have a great day.
keto,ffrjqz0,t1_ffrbmco,1580159438.0,"I totally agree about the not cheating. I hit a 3-4 week plateau where my weight didn’t budge at all so I decided to go off of it the past 2 days (Saturday and yesterday, Sunday). I had 3 carb heavy meals and today I am starting a 48 hour fast which I’ll break tomorrow. I’m doing something of an experiment with my body to see how I respond. I only went up 1# in those 2 days which was much lower than I expected. I thought I would retain a lot of water. But, I really didn’t. What did happen is eating those carb-heavy foods just made me feel like shit. So, one thing I gained was the realization that I don’t like those foods anymore. It’s like when I drink too much alcohol now and feel like shit for a solid 48 hours afterwards."
AskMen,ffrj93n,t1_ffr1ecs,1580159136.0,"I’ve been on hiatus from snowboarding for the past few years. But, I’m definitely getting back into it next season for exactly the reason you stated. Plus, the mountain covered in snow is just a peaceful and serene environment to spend the day in."
AskMen,ffrj39h,t1_ffr81zt,1580159036.0,"Yeah, totally agree, sketchy sometimes. I go out to the desert which, luckily for me, is only 25-30 minutes away. Everyone finds their own secluded spot up against a hill."

datingoverforty,ffri3wz,t3_eupfe0,1580158447.0,"Nobody is undamaged. We all have wounds from the past. But, if your wounds are fresh then you should sit it out for a while until those heal. If you need to take proactive action to facilitate the healing then that’s what you should be doing.

There’s a big difference between having open bleeding wounds vs having some scarring from healed wounds."
ActualPublicFreakouts,ffrcs61,t1_ffrc2mx,1580155388.0,"Actually, no. I posed a logical question, genuinely seeking intelligent input, after observing an overwhelming trend. I didn’t call anyone any childish names like you’re doing.

Your comment is a weak low-effort attempt at a rebuttal. So, you’re the stupid one if there’s one here."
ActualPublicFreakouts,ffrbsrn,t1_ffrbdjp,1580154785.0,"The teenager was looking for a fight. The teenager was bigger, and in better shape, than that “grown man.” I see it time and again where all the friends jump in once a fight has started. It’s not one video. It’s pretty much the norm. And, if mentioning race equates to racism then everyone is racist. So, no, I won’t STFU."
datingoverforty,ffr8q4g,t1_ffr83k2,1580152897.0,"Well, being in a relationship, by definition, is a controlling environment. You wouldn’t be happy if he disappeared to Vegas with a group of guys for a weekend without running it by you first. Right? So, in a relationship we are obligated to the other person. Of course, this can be taken overboard.

As far as not getting along and burning relationships with your friends and family goes... That’s an entirely different issue altogether. I didn’t get along great with my ex’s father largely because he was close with her ex husband and I think just never wanted them to divorce to begin with. Thus, I was never going to measure up. But, I never disrespected him and was always polite and cordial. It sounds like he has poor people skills maybe. And, to be fair, her father didn’t like her boyfriend before me, either."
datingoverforty,ffr785j,t3_eurt6e,1580151963.0,"Well, what “red flags,” if any, were on the paper that you think he’s showing?

People are people. Look hard enough and everyone, bar none, will show “red flags.” People are imperfect. You will not find perfection anywhere. The challenge is in finding someone with whom you can be with and grow."
ActualPublicFreakouts,ffr59on,t1_ffr44ls,1580150749.0,"You don’t think that should have been a 1-on1 fight? Or, are you offended because you’re black? I was asking a question."

datingoverforty,ffr0zbc,t3_euohp3,1580148067.0,"It’s not easier in that the competition is still high. So, if you normally rank lower in the dating hierarchy then you still will. But, it does remove the angst and awkwardness of having to try, over and over, to meet IRL. So, you are getting an “at bat” where you otherwise wouldn’t even have the courage to show up in the dugout."
AskMenOver30,ffq2ae2,t1_ffpxqnj,1580116453.0,"Yeah, I’ve never needed to use violence, or threats of violence, with my kids. That’s just not the relationship we have."

And, I haven’t seen him since 1988 because he abandoned my mom and I and never paid a dime in child support. We struggled a lot. He got in touch with me a year ago to try and rebuild a relationship. I told him what a prick he is and to not contact me again. My only regret is not changing my last name before getting married and having kids. Would rather not carry on his name."

omad,ffpey16,t1_ffpbt7m,1580093362.0,"Agreed. The thing is that everyone that has demonized him never gives any rational or logical explanation as to why. They rely on name-calling and other childish tactics. I’ve yet to hear anyone say anything that doesn’t fit into the “I don’t like him” or “bigot” category. The hypocritical part is that those who do will say that he’s hateful and bigoted while they’re being hateful and bigoted towards him. They believe that free speech is only for those they agree with (which means they don’t believe in free speech at all). Anyone who tries to shut someone down over something they said, by very definition, does not believe in freedom of thought or speech."

I used to watch Live Leak a lot and quit because I started getting racist thoughts from watching all the videos of the dumb shit black people do. I had to remember that those videos are of the worst segment of their culture and not representative of black people as a whole.

Any time you subject yourself to the worst parts of any given group of people you are prone to start feeling disgust towards them. And, that’s not how I want to live my life so I stopped watching that shit. I had to remember that I’ve known a lot of black people in my life and, really, only 1 of them was a complete douchebag. And, to be fair, there’s just as much white trash shenanigans on Live Leak as there are hoodrats."

But, where they crossed the line was when they all turn turns punching and kicking the guy after he was on the ground, turtled up, and no longer a threat. At that point the 3 guys became the aggressors and were clearly acting out of anger and retribution rather than self-defense.

dating,ffoiknn,t1_ffognf8,1580077991.0,"Not an oxymoron. Extroversion simply means that you get energized from social interaction. Being nerdy has different definitions to different people. I’d consider myself an extroverted nerd, too. To me, that just means that I’m well-read and informed on a wide range of topics."
omad,ffohv9y,t1_ffo7yam,1580077746.0,"Yeah, that’s too bad. People of courage and conviction are in short supply these days. Everyone wants to tickle people’s ears and not risk offending people. Any time someone speaks out forcefully about anything they always risk offending some. But, we need people like that to challenge thoughts and ideas. That’s the only way society moves forward. Personally, I love him. He has so many great things to say on a very wide range of topics.

People dislike him over the whole gender thing and I totally get that.  It’s not a popular stance to take nowadays. But, make no mistake about it. His legacy will be that of one of the fearless great thinkers of our time. I’ve watched a ton of his lectures and videos and I always walk away challenged, convicted, and inspired. It’s very rare that someone like him comes along. He’s a very wise man.

For me, that’s poor grammar. I’m a grammar Nazi so I need  someone with an excellent grasp of the English language. Inappropriately used “there, their, or they’re,” for example, will derail the whole thing."
