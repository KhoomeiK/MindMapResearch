They had digital cameras decades ago and didn’t have the foresight to shift. They stuck with film and are obsolete. This will be ever car company in existence today if they don’t switch.

I work in a country where we have immigrant labourers.  They get paid on a different scale, rules are strictly enforced, and the individual tied to the employer such that the. employer gets in trouble if they do something wrong.  Vary from that and they are deported.  

They have a better life here, send money home to their families, get all the healthcare they need, and it benefits the country in general as we get cheap labor.  No, that is not wrong, its economics."

Edit: To the person that tried to tell me not to guess a diagnosis, I didn’t. I said it was most consistent which is the same as could be and then I told him to go to a vet. 

Telling someone their pet could be ill and they should seek medical care is the exact point of his post. There is literally no response that would appropriate.  

Could say: 
Your cat may have pneumonia, cancer, asthma, etc and that he should see a vet but that’s the exact same thing as saying it’s more likely asthma than cancer or penuromonja but either way it need to see a vet.
