pics,fejq60a,t3_epjlpf,1579183019.0,That caption! ðŸ¤£
dogs,feh85lm,t3_ep5jpm,1579111133.0,"These are all such great responses and worded very well. I agree, itâ€™s never going to feel right but from your very honest description, it does sound like itâ€™s time. â¤ï¸"
dogs,feclo3m,t1_fec6ttc,1578976982.0,Both
dogs,febzlte,t1_febxrdq,1578964619.0,"Wow, I really didnâ€™t realize how everyone seems to have the exact same problem as me. I wish we all lived closer to each other! We could band together..."
dogs,febq7b3,t1_febp54v,1578961510.0,I havenâ€™t used it yet.
dogs,febpu6e,t1_feb4sz9,1578961375.0,Thatâ€™s crazy!
dogs,feb16b5,t1_feazaiy,1578954420.0,Thanks for trying to suggest something helpful but I donâ€™t see that going well.
dogs,fearlad,t3_eo5ud3,1578951604.0,Youâ€™re so nice! Iâ€™m feeling much better. I was feeling crazy because it seems like it was only happening to me and Iâ€™m made out to be the weirdo.
dogs,feansso,t1_feag377,1578950672.0,"Wow, Iâ€™m so sorry! Was the owner held responsible?"
dogs,fean3hz,t1_feabf4l,1578950456.0,"Yeah, I have to drive away to walk her, too. I have to pick my streets carefully or I drive to the next town over."
dogs,feamqce,t3_eo5ud3,1578950366.0,Thereâ€™s always one person like that.
dogs,feamjku,t3_eo5ud3,1578950309.0,Thatâ€™s beyond unreasonable!
dogs,fealvc5,t3_eo5ud3,1578950196.0,Rules are pointless if no one enforces them.
dogs,fea34m4,t3_eo5ud3,1578943872.0,This is exactly how my day goes every day. I feel your pain! And I already feel better knowing Iâ€™m not the only anxious dog walker out there. Itâ€™s not that hard to follow rules. Or apparently it is. Sigh.
dogs,fe9e61v,t1_fe9e1cu,1578936752.0,"Thatâ€™s exactly what I donâ€™t understand! Clearly they donâ€™t care about their dogs. And if they donâ€™t care about their own dogs, how can I expect them to care about mine?"
dogs,fe9e1b9,t3_eo5ud3,1578936700.0,Lol thanks for the info! Iâ€™ll look in to more trails.
dogs,fe9dkb3,t1_fe9c8ua,1578936624.0,"Wow, Iâ€™m so sorry for this! People really ruin things for others."
dogs,fe9dd7o,t1_fe9aq0y,1578936566.0,Thanks for the info. There are actually leash laws where I live. I called Animal Control for the first time yesterday.
dogs,fe95ym3,t3_eo5ud3,1578934628.0,"Yeah, itâ€™s impossible to make progress when peopleâ€™s dogs continually run up to you."
dogs,fe8x0o1,t1_fe8vyzy,1578931970.0,Thanks for the advice. I actually called animal control yesterday.
dogs,fe8wqi7,t1_fe8vf51,1578931923.0,It feels good to know Iâ€™m not alone.
dogs,fe8vekl,t3_eo5ud3,1578931446.0,"Itâ€™s not really rural, though. Just another suburb. Yes, thereâ€™s a trail but I walk her so often, I have to switch up where we walk to keep her interested."
HumansBeingBros,fe3908b,t1_fdz6rnn,1578847108.0,Seriously is cute!
aww,fdz3wtv,t3_en8shc,1578786363.0,That was awesome!!!
HumansBeingBros,fdz38xk,t1_fdyxe3o,1578786238.0,Haha he looks like a sewer rat. Glad you love your dog so much ðŸ˜Š
mildlyinteresting,fdi5alg,t3_elivf0,1578435983.0,He looks insulted.
aww,fddodos,t3_ekuimf,1578319478.0,Am I the only one that sees the dog eats the bird? Or is that part of the irony?
husky,fct8lpl,t3_eirud3,1577935773.0,"Thanks for the update! Do you have pet insurance? Sorry to be nosy, just curious how that insane cost is covered! And very thankful that it is."
husky,fct2l32,t3_eg2402,1577931234.0,Iâ€™d love to hear an update on your pup!
husky,fct2c91,t1_fcm15zd,1577931055.0,Best comment ðŸ˜‚

television,fcn2ei4,t3_ehvbym,1577801348.0,This is the only reason I have Netflix... for Friends.
AskReddit,fcn1tdz,t3_ei369b,1577800842.0,Anything not serving me.
husky,fcn1oc1,t1_fckogtp,1577800719.0,Lol! Itâ€™s always a hassle to get her inside. I usually end up having to bribe her.
dogs,fck31of,t3_ehf4hk,1577715094.0,"I canâ€™t fathom everything youâ€™ve been through. This might not be the time to hear this, but youâ€™re going to be so much stronger from all of this and youâ€™ll be able to help other people/dogs through hard parts of their lives. â¤ï¸ 
Thinking of you today."
dogs,fcc0ivo,t1_fcbv1dq,1577593037.0,"Mine is terrible too but because of off-leash dogs, 1-2 a week. Itâ€™s ridiculous. People by me just open their front door and let their dogs out to do their business. And 9 out of 10, they run up to my dog. It gives me such anxiety."
dogs,fcabyjp,t3_egqwiv,1577566438.0,Iâ€™m glad you shared this. Owning a dog is ruined by other ignorant dog owners almost every day for me. This uplifts my spirits a bit. Thanks!
worldnews,fc5vijj,t3_eg70d7,1577466796.0,Sick. People are sick. Heâ€™ll get his. Truly believe in Karma and heâ€™s just bringing it on himself.
husky,fc47ky9,t3_eg2402,1577408766.0,Literally my worst nightmare. Iâ€™m hoping for the best!
husky,fbjvhws,t1_fbitf6x,1576940701.0,Sheâ€™s 6
