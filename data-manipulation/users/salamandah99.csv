homeschool,ffgp60a,t3_etj2cq,1579911535.0,"I probably would not homeschool if I lived anywhere but here.  I have based my son's homeschool on the Finnish model (light academics up to age 8, lots of free play, lots of imagination play, no listing of ""subjects"").  The elementary school (1 of 5 in the county) ranks #680 out of 979 in the state.  The high school is #234 out of 341.  The nearest private school (not that I can afford it) is a 45 minute drive one way.  I am very lucky because I work in a family business so my son can go to work with me.  We are very happy with how things are going and my son always has the option to go back to public school if he wants to."
adhdwomen,ffg250g,t3_etegbo,1579896819.0,"All of this resonates with me so much!!  I was diagnosed about 3 months ago at age 46.  The rest of my family is still undiagnosed and untreated.  My mom hyperfocused on starting multiple businesses when I was a child.  She used to joke that her limit was 7 years.  By 7 years, the business would be doing good, rocking right along and she would be trying to think of the next thing.  And I see signs in my own son.  I haven't been able to decide if putting him on meds is the thing right now.  He is 11.  I feel like it will be necessary in a few years"
ADHD,ff77kbr,t3_erwmd9,1579642677.0,"I got diagnosed and medicated 2 months ago.  I am 46 and female. I was very quiet in school and I read all the time.   I was treated for depression thoughout my 20's, even going so far as to have ECT because I was diagnosed with medication resistant depression. Anytime I mentioned ADHD as a possibility I was told that since I can finish a book, I could not have ADHD. Once in my 30's I was prescribed adderall and it was a miracle.  But then my cousin took half my prescription and I was embarrassed so I never went back.  Finally this year, I made an appointment at the local mental health place.  and I was told I couldn't have ADHD because I had cut out caffeine and I was able to sleep better.  She told me that stimulants help ADHD, not hurt.  Disgusted and disappointed I decided to just live with it. Then I changed my mind and thought I would try one more time.  And I am now nearing my 3rd month on meds, still increasing because my dose just does not help me yet.  But I am getting there.  so, yes, I have had that type of experience.  And it sucks and is totally discouraging.  It is hard enough to accept that my brain doesn't work like everyone elses and then be told there is nothing wrong with me.  Everything is a struggle.  I have such a hard time with so many mundane things.  But I can crochet for 8 hours straight or read or dive deep into something I am interested in.  And finally being told I do have ADHD has helped me to actually accept it for myself.  I am so sorry this happened.  Tell your fiance to keep fighting for herself.  You keep fighting for her too."
DogCare,ff5wxog,t3_err7r6,1579612996.0,"You have already gotten your answers but I wanted to add some things...The Rabies vaccine is required in most if not all states.  I work at a dog shelter.  For a long time, we did not get our dogs vaccinated for rabies unless they were going to another state or we wanted to take them out in public.  It was brought to our attention that if one of our dogs bit someone and did not have a rabies vaccine, that dog would have to be on rabies hold and the person would probably have to go through rabies treatment.  We started getting all our dog vaccinated.  It is a pain because we either have to take the dog to the vet or the vet has to come to the shelter.  All adult dogs are given bordatella vaccine and dappv on intake.  kennel cough is very easy to catch in a crowded situation like a shelter.  The dappv is for distemper, adenovirus, parvo and a couple of other things.  Parvo can live in soil for up to a year.  It can travel on clothing.  It is passed through feces.  For example a dog poops and has parvo.  the obvious poop washes away into the soil.  your dog walks over it and licks its feet a few minutes later.  Now your dog may have parvo.  It is an unpleasant illness with vomiting and diarrhea and can lead to death even with treatment.

Vaccines do not hurt your dog.  Vaccines are not bad for your dog.  Vaccines will help your dog to lead a long and happy life free from deadly illness.

High five to you for having questions and not being afraid to ask.  there is a lot of anti-vax stuff out there and if you look into it long enough it starts to get into your brain.  I hope you and your pup have many wonderful adventures together!"
dogs,ff2yr0b,t3_erdezp,1579528893.0,"breed is always just a guess unless you do a DNA test.  there are weight calculators on the internet.  You just put in his age, current weight and best guess at breed (husky doesn't look too far off, maybe some collie) and it will give you a prediction/ guess on adult weight."

adhdwomen,fedlovu,t3_eokune,1579014604.0,"I have band-aids on two fingers right now because I have picked/bitten them so bad they bleed.  I notice that I do it much more when I am stressed.  I don't feel stressed but then I realize I am tearing my fingers up and then realize I am a bit stressed.  I managed to quit biting my nails and picking at scabs for the most part but I can't stop this.  In my senior year of high school, I did not have finger prints on a few of my fingers from this.  I also have dishydrosis (not sure of spelling) that causes itchiness and cracking on my hands.  Which causes me to pick and then bleed and then scab and then pick, ad nauseum."
dogs,fdvlclo,t3_en13cx,1578748607.0,"you did the right thing.  Your friend was suffering.  You set her free from that even though you are suffering now.  that is unconditional love.  I would suggest, in her honor, if you can, volunteer at a dog shelter and sit with the scared dogs, play with the big dogs.  You have loads of experience now in a way that a lot of people do not.  If nothing else please know this, your sweet pup does not blame you for anything.  Please try to let go of the guilt and all the thoughts of ""if I had only done...""  From what I can tell, you did everything you could to manage her stress.  And when you could not manage it anymore, when her quality of life (not yours) was suffering, you set her free.  much love and hugs.  I'm so sorry it had to come to this.  It takes a huge heart to do what is the best for someone else even though it causes you huge pain."
Dogtraining,fdvi9yj,t3_en6jtu,1578747663.0,I have seen people who have diggers section off a part of the yard (with landscape timbers or something similar) and fill it with sand or dirt and train their dog to only dig there.  Digging is making her feel good and happy and excited.  You can't take that completely away from her but you can redirect and train her (hopefully) to use just her part of the yard for that.
AnimalShelterStories,fddjltx,t3_eko8eb,1578314857.0,"TLDR:  You can do this.  You are stronger than the negative.  You are doing great things for the animals in your care.  It is hard, no doubt.  People are the worst. 

At times like these, you just put your head down and push through.  I have dealt with my sadness at what these poor animals go through by really looking into what kind of enrichment I can do for them.  And I have joined facebook groups that are made up of people in similar professions that I can ask questions. (helping shelter animals is one, compassionate badassery is another).  for a lot of people who work in the shelter environment, they build up a pretty hard shell to deal with the horrible things.  you try to find positives where you can.  right now I have 7 puppies in my bathroom that were picked up by animal control abandoned on the side of a country road.  They are wormy, had the worst case of fleas I have ever seen, some have scabs and scars and I don't know if it is from scratching the fleas or from being attacked.  When I got them, they were so scared they would scream and bite.  In two days they have started wagging their tails when they see me and about half of them will come to me for pets.  they were all under 5 lbs when they came in but their bellies are less bloated so I think they are gaining weight.  these 7 puppies will have a future because a few people worked hard to get them safe.  on the other hand, one of my big babies from animal control slipped out of his harness on Wednesday and almost killed another dog.  He was also injured in the fight and I made the decision to have him euthanized.  I cried for days.  I felt like I failed him and that I could not go to the shelter another day.  our shelter is small and we rarely have to euthanize healthy dogs.  and we have had to euthanize 2 in 2 days for behavior issues that I feel could have been dealt with if we had more money, more resources, more time.  Some days are worse, some days are better.  Every time I think about quitting, I think about all the free time I would have (my shelter is 100% volunteer run) and I am sad because I would miss my dogs.  When I get to the point that I feel happy at that thought, I will know it is time to quit."
YouShouldKnow,fdcibuf,t3_ekjllg,1578275618.0,"I work at the county animal shelter. I have yet to find a pet with a microchip that actually leads back to the owner. Most have out of date info, dog has been given or sold to someone else and the chip just leads to dead ends. It makes me so sad"

adhdwomen,fbybzj3,t3_eexqmy,1577213104.0,"I don't know if this can help you in your current situation but something I have started doing with my family is grocery pickup.  the closest one is about 20 minute drive one way but we can all add things to the list up until the day before we have to go get it.  Then set the time to pick it up, they load it up and I drive home.  This is especially helpful for me because I can add things to my list pretty much when I think about it.  And so can everyone else."
