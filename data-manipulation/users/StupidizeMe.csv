In fact, it looks like it's the exact same image posted in a thumbnail on the website 'A Candy Rose.' Being such an old website A Candy Rose has very funky old  formatting with low-res images. (But it's a fantastic resource, for which we are grateful! I'm adding the Candy Rose link below.)

 - Tabloid 'The Globe' offered the first reward of $50,000 on January 15, 1997. 

- The Ramseys offered their own reward of $100,00 on April 27,1997, four months after JonBenet's death. (Hard not to notice that it's even less money than the strangely low ransom amount demanded in the Ramsey 'ransom note.')

- On December 26, 2001 USA Today reported that Ramsey Attorney Lin Wood said, **""The family no longer has the $100,000 it was offering.""**

I find that utterly bizarre. In less than 4 years the multi-millionaire  Ramseys SPENT the Reward money intended to help catch their daughter's killer? 

I've seen other news reports about the Ramsey reward being quietly cancelled, but I don't have them handy. (Sorry, I don't keep a file on this case.) Maybe someone else can post them.

That's interesting. It seems to indicate that the Ramseys and their attorney use JonBenet's tragic death to generate large sums of money for themselves?

Yet the Ramseys pretend to be broke and don't even have a huge REWARD offered for information leading to the arrest of JonBenet's killer. The Ramseys withdrew the measly $100,000 Reward many years ago.

Why don't the Ramseys use the loads of money they make suing people to offer a new $1 Million Reward and see if that gets the investigation moving again? JonBenet still deserves Justice."

How can a vaginal wound that bleeds tell you somebody has ""already been strangled""? It can't.

Do you see on the left side there's a metal semi-circle to hold the end of the pin? That's called a ""C-Clasp"" because it's shaped like a letter C. 

C-clasps were used for many years, throught the 19th Century Victorian era and sometimes into the early 1900s. The pin shanks used on brooches were very big and thick, and the sharp point often extended past the body of the brooch. This was an effort to let the wearer stick enough cloth through it that it would stay on. (They're still sharp! I've stuck my thumb many times handling old Victorian brooches.)

Locking ""Safety Catches"" such as the Trombone Clasp were being experimented with in the 1890s, because the lack of a safety clasp made it so easy to lose your brooch, or have it fall and smash on the floor (especially fragile shell Cameos). 

The clasp we mostly use today, the Locking Clasp w/Spring Ring  or Lever came into general use around 1900. So generally speaking, a plain C- Clasp indicates pre-1900, but that's not a rigid rule. (My Grandmother's c.1930 Shell Cameo was made with no safety clasp.)  Jewelry makers continued to use the various clasps & findings they already had in stock. But examining the clasp hardware is another tool used to date jewelry.

If you want this brooch to be wearable you can buy a little rubber or plastic safety for it. They look a bit like clear gummy-feeling plastic earring backs, and slide onto pin help prevent the pin from slipping out of the fabric. 
(You can also have a jeweler change the C-clasp to a Safety clasp for cheap.)

You did a good job cleaning it. Don't try to clean the metal any more; it won't get shinier. It looks great the way it is, but
 You can dip in gentle cleaner like Goddard's Jewelry Cleaner for a minute to help make glass stones sparkle. It comes with tiny soft jewelry brush; you just dip, brush if needed, rinse in water and dry front side down on a towel."

It's Late Victorian Era going into to Edwardian Era, probably circa late 1890s-1915. 

The style shows definite Art Nouveau influence (very fluid, slender, graceful lines inspired by Nature, as opposed to the big, heavy, ornate Victorian style.)  Notice the brass arcs in a shape similar to insect antennae in the center? :)

I wouldn't be surprised if this brooch was originally part of a set with matching earrings and possibly a Lavaliere style necklace

  I suspect it might be Bohemian Glass. 
The region of Bohemia that became Czecho-Slovakia after WWII was always famous for its gorgeous handblown and lamp-worked glass. They made glass lamp shades, vases, buttons, beads and jewelry as well as trimmings for hats. They created incredibly beautiful glass ""jewels"" for the jewelry trade. The brass wirework setting looks like it could be Czech too. They made all kinds of jewelry findings. 

If you can post a photo of the back of the brooch showing  a good closeup of the hinge and pin, I might be able to find a maker's mark. Mark can be on or under the pin itself.

The Ramseys had millions of dollars and all kinds of legal and political connections; I think they put him through many years of highly specialized cutting-edge psychotherapy,  probably including including therapeutic hypnosis. 

You know how killers show twinges of remorse for their crimes by a behavior that's  termed ""Undoing?"" I think that's sort of what the Ramseys did with their son's therapy.

Fine Motor Skills use small muscles controlled by nerves to give you the manual coordination, control, strength and dexterity you need to perform complex tasks with your hands.

 An example of a fine motor skill is being able to button all the small buttons on a dress shirt.

But imagine this: Patsy discovers JonBenet unconscious, looking comatose or close to death, with physical signs of Sexual Abuse. Maybe drops of blood. Maybe even some object pushed inside her.

The reseller has a right to be compensated. If this went to Small Claims court I think designer would lose and have to cover Court costs too."

JonBenetRamsey,ffd1ggg,t1_ffbkb8v,1579811541.0,"I think the phrase ""Victory!"" gives insight into the writer's mind. The writer is Patsy. 

I think Patsy used her personal religious beliefs to help her get through the utter awfulness of what she felt she had to do to protect her remaining family. 

She went to mind-bendingly extreme lengths to cover up what really happened to JonBenet. I think she used her firm belief that JonBenet was ""already safe,"" enjoying Eternal Life in Heaven and was beyond any earthly suffering... Even beyond any earthly physical death.

  In Christianity, because Jesus triumphed over Death, believers triumph over Death too. Believers share in Christ's Victory. I think that was the Victory she was referring to. The phrase ""Victory!"" sounded generic enough to her to double as a signoff from a murky Small Foreign Faction of Terrorists.


I'm not an Evangelical, but I know Catholic Mass cards from funerals often contain comforting passages from Scriptures, such as, *""From Death to Life, through Christ""* or *""I Am the Resurrection and the Life. Whosever believeth in Me shall never die.""*"
JonBenetRamsey,ffczlco,t3_espmhi,1579810506.0,"""Victory"" has always been obvious to me.

If you're a Christian, Christ's death on the Cross and his Resurrection is literally the ""Eternal Victory of Life Over Death.""

It means Life is Eternal."
Horses,ffcyoco,t3_es9lig,1579809993.0,"I had to let my beautiful girl go 8 years ago, and I still miss her. My eyes fill with tears when I think of her. But I'm so grateful for the wonderful times we had together.

When I feel blue, I remind myself how blessed I am that of everybody in the world, she was MY horse and she loved me.
 I know she was happy with me, and I know I'll see her again some day. 

I hope knowing that your horse loved you so much and had a happy life can comfort you too."

There's been some talk about Burke possibly already being in psychiatric treatment at time of his sister's death, but the Ramseys absolutely blocked access to his medical/psychiatric records. He was 30 days too young to be charged with any crime in Colorado, so his records were protected.

 Apparently the Boulder Grand Jury got to see and hear evidence that the rest of us had not, possibly more info on Burke, and we know they voted to indict both John and Patsy (individually) for the crimes of 'Felony Child Abuse Resulting In Death' and 'Accessory To Murder.'"

 Petrified wood is back-breakingly heavy, a dead weight. Even small pieces weigh a lot. They will need heavy equipment to get any larger chunks.

JonBenetRamsey,ffayxqz,t3_eskt2e,1579747723.0,"I think on the night of Dec 25-26 Burke was told whatever he might have done to his sister, she was gonna be OK. He was sent to bed and told to STAY IN HIS ROOM. All the staging was then done and probably the final strangulation. 

In the morning he was told something like ""She was OK and went to bed. But bad people came in and kidnapped her and took her away"" as if it was a completely separate invent not involving him. I think he spent a lifetime in private Psychotherapy being taught to believe this alternate version of events.

My interpretation of ""What did you find?"" is that it  was probably because he heard Patsy say  to 911 Operator, *""There's a note left and our daughter's gone!""* and, *""A ransom note!!""*"
