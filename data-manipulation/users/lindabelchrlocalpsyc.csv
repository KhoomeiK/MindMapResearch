AskMen,ffcrm1r,t3_esruuu,1579805825.0,"My husband and I love each other immensely (married 12 years), but he rarely wears his ring because it sometimes causes an allergic reaction on his finger and he’s more comfortable without it, and I rotate through wearing the rings he bought me, vintage rings I bought myself in a different metal, my mother’s rings, my grandmother’s rings, and rings from my mom’s first marriage. He doesn’t mind, so I wear whatever sparks my interest on any given day. He just recently talked about getting a new ring with a meaningful design and that sounds nice - I want him to be happy, so whatever he wants to do ring-wise is fine."

AskReddit,ffcfp3r,t3_esps5n,1579798465.0,"The idea of demons - like intangible beings that I can’t hurt but they can hurt me. That creeps me right the heck out. Also irrationally afraid of medium-large spiders. I can deal with the little ones, but the big ones give me anxiety and it takes a long time for me to calm down."
