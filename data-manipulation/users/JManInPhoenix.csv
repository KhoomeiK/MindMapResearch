When we got our pup, she quickly discovered that pouncing on the door handle would open the door - she would use one paw to slam the handle down and the other to push the door open.  She even figured out if she did it enough times to a locked door, it would slowly unlock the door.  After about a month of that, I changed all the door handles to door knobs."

Darwin was also bombed by the same fleet that attacked Pearl Harbor.

In addition to action in the Southwest Pacific, Australians also fought in North Africa, Greece and the middle east."
