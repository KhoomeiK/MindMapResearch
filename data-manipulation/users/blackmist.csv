wow,fgssv1r,t1_fgshn2p,1581091944.0,I drank the potion next to the corpse. I'd never survive in the wild.
UKPersonalFinance,fgspn8i,t1_fgs5o08,1581089956.0,"Are you suggesting giant multinational investment company Schroders might have an ulterior motive in convincing people to keep all their money invested in the markets?

I'm shocked I tell you.

Thing is the best and worst days tend to be clumped together anyway as bubbles burst and rebound a bit. Even looking at the FTSE100 around Black Monday you can see it was bound to happen. Of course nobody wants to be the dumb schmuck that takes their money out of what is clearly (at the time) a goldmine."

Games,fgsnfw6,t1_fgsikxq,1581088551.0,I'm intrigued by what these people think 12th century Nottingham looked like.
wow,fgsi9df,t3_f027o6,1581085021.0,"Good job they killed it this week then, considering how many Echoing Void items they no doubt have.

I might keep mine, it's kind of fun standing will all the melee derps."

I watched the terrible Taron Egerton Robin Hood film the other month and all I kept thinking throughout was how cool a Robin Hood AC game would be."
hometheater,fgrzinx,t3_ezyf8f,1581064000.0,To be fair that's a shit monitor. It's probably worth less than the mount.
aww,fgqu2r3,t3_ezx5tu,1581031507.0,I thought Limit just killed that motherfucker.

Even the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways phased out the Pacer trains, yet here we are still pretending a shed on wheels is an acceptable mode of transport in 2020."

She never noticed that half the characters were played by the same podgy northerner."
AskUK,fgp1r5u,t3_ezpp0p,1580994403.0,Never bothered. I keep the curtains closed all the time anyway.
hometheater,fgp1cn5,t3_ezr6ah,1580994054.0,"Backlight bulb on the fritz maybe? No idea what TV it is so no idea how it's lit.

You could potentially get it repaired, but it would likely cost more than getting a cheap TV.

Either way I'd say it's fucked, and time ain't gonna make it better. Get saving."
atheism,fgotpnl,t3_ezedkm,1580986135.0,"Unfortunately this then makes for an education system that can't create people who vote for the people we currently see in power around the globe.

And that is why they will never allow it to happen. A stupid populace is a docile and easy to control one."
standupshots,fgosyow,t1_fgm21q1,1580985102.0,I went to bed an hour early last night. This morning I woke up an hour early. How did that help?
wow,fgos6xl,t3_ezmy28,1580984011.0,"As a BM hunter I've had it doing 10% of my damage. I'll probably stick with it on the grounds that I don't have anything better than even a nerfed EV.

If they're going to nerf it so drastically, they should change it from a point blank AoE to a target based one. At least for ranged characters."
wow,fgos016,t3_ezns4i,1580983749.0,"There's a whole lot of garbage in the loot table as well.

Instead of crappy Mastery/Versa/Haste buffs which may be useless for you, how about one unified one that just boosts your highest secondary stat?

The nerf to Echoing Void is probably needed, although as a sweetener it could be tweaked to do damage around your current target rather than you. That way squishy casters don't have to stand in the danger zone all the damn time.

They really need to boost the effectiveness of the poorer corruptions, while bringing down Infinite Stars a bit. If Echoing Void isn't allowed to be OP, I don't know why Inf Stars gets a pass..."
CasualUK,fgmlc6c,t3_eyz9p1,1580926911.0,"I had mine laid out on the wall like actual constellations.

I even had one wall painted gray with black portholes as ""windows""."
technology,fgmjc61,t1_fgmhbml,1580925736.0,"I suspect it's down to shutter speed. At 24fps, you typically have a shutter speed of 1/48th of a second. A fair amount of motion blur is in that and looks fairly natural.

Stretch that motion blur to 60 or 120fps, and you end up with a mess of lost detail where your eyes expect to see some.

If you want higher frame rates, adding them at the source is by far the best option."
wow,fgmelem,t1_fgkmukl,1580923003.0,"Depending on the scale of this nerf, that'll be me tonight..."
wow,fgmc3tk,t1_fglq5k9,1580921736.0,"I'm going to guess that all the zones will be the same 50-60 scaling thing we have now.

I'm not a fan of grinding the requirements (I'd rather it just unlocked, rather than forcing people who only raid or only PvP into doing bullshit WQs), but don't mind having a few patches of ground travel."

Games,fgm8ko4,t1_fgl929j,1580919959.0,"I got downvoted to fuck the other day for pointing out that their ""if you want another island in Animal Crossing, you need to buy a second Switch"" policy might be a tad anti-consumer.

You can't help them. They're not just lost. They want to be lost."
Games,fglu02x,t1_fgjz3hb,1580910897.0,"I don't think he actually worked on the first GTA. It was originally a game called Race'n'Chase. He had something to do with signing them as a publisher though.

Fun fact: That's his mum in classic Michael Caine movie, Get Carter. She's the one he's sleeping with when he grabs the shotgun and walks down the street completely Billy Bollocks."

Instead they got better, if anything."

eARC adds more audio formats to the ARC, so it actually handles (theoretically) everything regular HDMI carries.

We're in an awkward transition phase where not everything supports it."
