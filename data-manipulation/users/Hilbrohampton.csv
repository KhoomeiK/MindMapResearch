assholedesign,ff5xdbn,t1_ff5qo9s,1579613384.0,"There can be good reasons. Usually what happens is that rather than storing your password as text (which would be insecure if the storage gets breached in some way), what is actually stored is a hash of your password. A hash is basically a fixed size piece of data that gets generated using your password. All hashes are the same size regardless of how long your password is.

When you log in, you enter your password and then the hash gets generated. Then to check the server you are logging into just checks if that hash matches the one you they have on file.

This way only you know what your actual password is, but apple etc. Can still check its you.

The software for generating that hash may have issues dealing with longer passwords. It might take too long or might just not be possible for the software to compute if for passwords that long.

Long passwords might also cause and issue where two hashes, for two different passwords are the same, which can be exploited to hack the system.

Other reasons might be to prevent attacks to the site e.g. someone send a password with a million letters to try and cause denial of service.

In general having a maximum password size isn't really ideal and often sites just have a maximum length without really understanding why (e.g. sites that have like maximum lengths of 8), but there is some good reasons. In this case 32 characters is pretty generous."
assholedesign,ff5wdx1,t1_ff5qpc0,1579612486.0,"
I'm not sure you're quite right here as most password storage and verification uses hashing not encryption. 

That should be able to deal with arbitrary sizes unless the hashing algorithm has issues with collisions with longer strings or has issues with performance which is unlikely. They usually just hash the password text not use it to generate a key.

I'm sorry but this explanation that it uses encryption isn't really true and doesn't make sense. So the encrypted password is stored, but what happens to the key? Is the key generated every time I enter my password and then used to encrypt my password and compare my encrypted to the encrypted password stored by the server, because that has more overhead than hashing your password and comparing. Hashing also gets around the issue of fixed column widths."

What you want for that intelligence to then create models that exist outside of what it has been trained to model. The problem becomes how can we generate new knowledge from a system that can only take in existing knowledge.

From a physics standpoint too you have to keep in mind this is the same way physics works for us too. We make observations from and then generate models (theories) that describe it appropriately e.g. the wave equation is some mathemagical element encoded into everything, it's just a model that describes what we observe very well. Sure we can teach an AI the models we use, but they can't then progress further than that. Just because we teach it atoms doesn't mean it can now discover quarks for example."
