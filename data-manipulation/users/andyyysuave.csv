apexlegends,fefruvd,t3_eoxhw2,1579063355.0,I had this one where I tried to res my teammate but it kept on stopping midway for no reason. Also the respawn beacon wasn‚Äôt working. Made the sound and it didn‚Äôt respawn me
apexlegends,fefrohf,t3_eoxi8b,1579063215.0,Do you also have this bug where you try to revive your teamate but it stops for no reason?
apexlegends,feeuhtm,t1_feeua68,1579041486.0,Just like the L star cuz I have noticed that the L star heats up and stops shooting but my mag still has about 10 more bullets.
apexlegends,feeuapq,t1_feetyxj,1579041363.0,Or make my drone follow me but not when im running cuz tht would be OP. Instead of me having to push it.  Also they need to fix this bug where I pull my drone out when Im blocking a door and the drone appears at the other side of the door.

apexlegends,fdm2lx8,t1_fdm1ucc,1578538319.0,"I only play one legend. Played wraith at the beginning of the game, after learning the game I played mirage. Now I play lifeline only unless Im doing stupid stuff with my friends. I don‚Äôt really get bored of Lifetime. I‚Äôm fell in love with pinging Mozambiques."
apexlegends,fdl7i2l,t1_fdjtte8,1578518360.0,The wraith also played it really bad.
apexlegends,fdl1izx,t1_fdk20sv,1578515428.0,Lmaoo learned from fighting 2 many Gibbies this season
apexlegends,fdiu1iq,t1_fdiszul,1578451031.0,"Yeah, but its a little harder for lifeline to be effective in this map but makes you a better player in terms of movement."
apexlegends,fdiqfm3,t1_fdilgeg,1578448723.0,"I agree, I mostly play ranked solo. But I have noticed that lately my lobbies are getting a little harder and I want them to because I want to keep improving."
apexlegends,fdipshz,t1_fdipa7t,1578448312.0,I meant to say AIM not MAIN my baddddd
apexlegends,fdhvtb9,t1_fdht2u1,1578431053.0,I rarely use a shotgun. My wingman shot is better than my shotgun. Probably cuz I use the wingman more often.
apexlegends,fdhpmuw,t3_elgrib,1578427660.0,Fireeeeee
apexlegends,fdhpg8s,t1_fdgyngq,1578427548.0,"I hate shotguns, reason #1 my main Lmaoo"

apexlegends,fd8hdih,t3_ekb49p,1578218436.0,"Great for u! Worth the journey. I am solo queuing too but my goal is Diamond. Im not that great of player. I also don‚Äôt want to dashboard my way to predator. Currently at Plat 1, Im so close."

apexlegends,fczngej,t1_fczmx6v,1578105058.0,I had no choice. He came up to me but I didn‚Äôt hear him because tht stupid music on Mirage‚Äôs ship is loud af.
apexlegends,fczn1ez,t1_fczllit,1578104801.0,Yeah just wasn‚Äôt thinking
apexlegends,fczmqvw,t1_fczmd5o,1578104616.0,Took me until season 2 to get tht badge like there is no way. Since I spectated him the whole match I noticed tht he did play like an experience player against experienced players. He was in my match cuz only one of his teammates was level 100+ . I feel bad for legit new players that run up to him when he plays by himself.
apexlegends,fczmag5,t1_fczlmei,1578104327.0,I spectated him and he won with 10 kills.
apexlegends,fczm340,t1_fczlmei,1578104201.0,His teammate is literally smurfing 2. He‚Äôs level 20 with 200 kills.
apexlegends,fczc32n,t1_fcxmm4k,1578097915.0,Whenever I get rushed with a full send and I kill them. Might get a lil toxic and do a finisher

apexlegends,fcsj611,t3_eiopyc,1577917576.0,I only use to a quick double head shot when peeking to avoid damage in mid range fight
apexlegends,fcrrffe,t3_eim58t,1577905604.0,I was in the same spot the firs season and i ended up at level 63. I was at level 40 when 50 days were left but i just didn‚Äôt feel like wasting time doing challenges. This season‚Äôs challenges are alot easier tho I think you can do it. I completed them without even noticing.
apexlegends,fcmt7f0,t3_ei1jfv,1577791091.0,looks creepy af lmaoo
apexlegends,fcmmb13,t3_ei08dh,1577781342.0,Never thought about it. Do not play wattson but will definitely use it whenever I decide to play her.

apexlegends,fc4gb62,t1_fc4e68k,1577415821.0,Leave the kid alone damn haha. Yes he did not see his lifetime kills. You do not need to remind it to him If u see that another already said it and he responded to them
apexlegends,fc4fwk0,t3_eg557q,1577415484.0,Thts really good if u started playing a month ago. Just keep playing and enjoy the game. You‚Äôll get much better
apexlegends,fc3sm7b,t3_eg1ls8,1577397582.0,Lmaooo I would leave the game. Nah nvm I would just try to kill at least one of them and I would be satisfied with that. Definitely a good opportunity to test yourself and experience what is like to pkay against those type of players.
apexlegends,fc3sbe6,t1_fc3s3g2,1577397367.0,Oh ok thank you

apexlegends,fc3ndgn,t3_eg0tep,1577393854.0,Im enjoying the game right now. I consider myself a mid tier player. Started playing some ranked and it made me better. Went back to pubs and became a much more aggressive player. Just had my best game a few minutes ago
