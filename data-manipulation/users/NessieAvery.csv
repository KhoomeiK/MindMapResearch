We had the same interests, we got on well, and many people around us were expecting it to happen. And he really did like me. But I just couldn't. It felt like I was lying to him if I said that I felt that way about him. It was horrible because I knew it would hurt him. So I explained I didn't work like that, and we continued being friends.

I do think it's important for asexuals to consider whether their lack of attraction is due to an aversion to vulnerability or other emotional problems, but that's a natural part of deciding whether you are asexual. Asexuality by itself doesn't mean you've been abused or have emotional problems, we're just like anyone else, and you wouldn't send anyone else to therapy for some arbitrary characteristic"
