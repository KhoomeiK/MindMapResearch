NintendoSwitch,fggotfq,t1_fggn3q6,1580766321.0,"It's not that the Wii u version wasn't great. In fact, a lot of people see it as one of those games that its almost tragic that it had to release solely on the Wii u.

The problem is that the Wii u sold like trash, and platinum games are much more niche compared to your marios and zeldas."

There are 4 people involved here.

Person b made a joke about it, saying they needed to be spoon fed for having adhd.

Person c accidentally liked the joke post, and they were promptly called out by person d for liking an insensitive joke.

The post that is quoted is by person b, while we see the interaction between c and d."

Infinite grip let's you cheese some areas but otherwise just let's you play it slow, invulnerability let's you ignore some of the more hectic rooms and just focus on platforming. Infinite dash is pretty broken though, yeah."
NintendoSwitch,fdt0xag,t1_fdsct2v,1578710488.0,"Another commenter pointed out assist mode, but let me just reiterate just how configurable assist mode is.

You can gain infinite stamina, allowing you to just scale many walls.

You can get infinite dashes, meaning ideally you should never fall in a pit

You can become invincible, so spikes and similar won't hurt you

And most importantly, you can change the speed of the game, I believe in units of 10%, from 100 to 50.

You will absolutely be able to find a difficulty setting that is challenging but doable, and if you manage to beat it without any assist options it will feel so damn good.

I cannot recommend this game enough"

pokemon,fdnxu4o,t1_fdnrh5n,1578595045.0,"Right. Whereas a first game, plus one expansion pass, is 90 dollars. Which is greater than 60 dollars that you would pay if you just bought the second game."
