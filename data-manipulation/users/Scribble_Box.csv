Damn... Well put. Sad, but true."

ABoringDystopia,ffiz8xa,t1_ffi6vqo,1579986387.0,">Are people really calling ambulances just to get a ride to the hospital in non emergencies?

I'm a paramedic in Canada and to answer your question, yes.. Oooh yes.

A huge portion of the calls we do are people who absolutely did not need to call an ambulance. You wouldn't believe some of the shit we get called to. Last week I responded to knee pain... Nothing else, just a completely healthy person with some minor pain in their knee.. I wish I could tell you this was a rare event, but sadly it's not.

There needs to be a massive ad campaign to let the public know when it is appropriate to call 911."

worldnews,ffirics,t1_ffic11d,1579980896.0,"Not sure how how EMS works in your area, but most places paramedics aren't based out of the hospital. We have stations all over the city with hundreds of ambulances and medics working at a time."
worldnews,ffipca2,t1_ffigkav,1579979374.0,"I work as a paramedic and I really wish more people were like you. It's ridiculous how many people don't know when it is appropriate to visit the ER vs their local clinic. So many people think that having a cold for more than two days constitutes a visit to the emergency room... These people just clog up the system when they should be seeing their doc instead, or just staying home. It's called an emergency room for a reason! 

Hospitals in most busy areas are already overwhelmingly busy. I can't imagine what a pandemic like this would do. It would be a disaster."

beholdthemasterrace,ff9w1ps,t1_ff8y3kg,1579722753.0,"I was watching a documentary show on netflix about undocumented immigrants in the US. There was a Latino woman and her husband on it. Husband was in the military and the wife was illegally in the US. They both voted for trump and now she is being deported. 

She literally was crying and trying to rationalize their vote for Trump by saying ""I never thought he would deport me because my husband is in the military! How could he do this?!""

Roadcam,ff6r7dy,t1_ff5a6ni,1579633182.0,Yeah.. This is kind of mind blowing to me. I drive my personal car over 1000 km a week and drive even more for work. I've had my dashcam for probably 6+ years and I'm pretty sure I can count the amount of clips I've saved on two hands.
