All i know is that i want to be involved with my kids lives and actually give a shit about what goes on in them."

MagicArena,fdollqf,t1_fdokum5,1578607628.0,"This helped a lot, thanks!

But when you say save prize packs after 66%, what do you mean? Like you just don't open them?

Also, is there an advantage to drafting every rare? Even if that rare is a bulk or trash rare?"
MagicArena,fdob6oa,t1_fdoapjz,1578602032.0,"Oh okay. Yeah, I'd honestly love to have more common and uncommon wildcards rn lol. It took me the full month to get enough to make a mono g deathtouch deck with no questing beasts lol"
MagicArena,fdoavze,t1_fdo9s7c,1578601888.0,"Luckily I think I'm decent at drafting (its getting more difficult as i climb ranks obvi, but before i quit magic i was primarily a draft player) as I've gone 7-2 twice already, with only 6 draft runs. But I did have a 0-3 and a 1-3, so there's that too lol. I still get stuck on colors and havent learned how to pivot to another color mid draft if needed.

But i heard it's more gold efficient to draft rather than just buy packs, so that's what I've been doing"

magicTCG,fcc6vdr,t3_egt13c,1577595070.0,"Yeah, same for me. I quit magic about 2 years ago because of something that happened at a LGS. It was during an eternal masters draft, i saw a guy slipping in cards from his backpack, and i called him out. Well turns out that guy was a regular and also friends with the staff, so they all back him up, and then proceeded to be shitty to me the rest of the night. 

I'm proud to say i 4-0'd that night, but still, I dropped like $30 for that draft, and it would have sucked to lose to some bs cheater"
