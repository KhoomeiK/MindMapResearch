The ridge is formed by the metopic suture closing up. 

When you break a bone, your body lays the framework for healing quickly. This isn't neat or small: it needs to provide the first support. This causes a thick patch of bone near where the break was.

Sometimes, the body does this too when it needs to close another gap of bone, like the metopic suture of the skull. When it finished closing, the ridge will get less prominent over time, as the rougly put down bone is restructured into neat, solid bone. This can take a few weeks, to a few months, to a few years in adults. 

It's only in very rare cases these processes go haywire. I cannot tell you if and how the doctor will see that; as an archaeologist, I haven't learned about living humans. But you can be confident your doctor will see it when that is the case.

Fun fact: this suture doesn't close in all humans. About 10% of adults have what is called a ""persistent metopic suture"". It is no medical condition, just a variation that doesn't affect us, like the colour of our hair :)"

Or a small apartment with an external caretaker like me or my gf? I get help once a week, she gets help 3 times a week. It's not quite the same as a supported living arrangement, but I like it this way.

Ofc you don't have very accessible healthcare in the States, generally speaking. But more often then not people don't even know these types of help exist in the first place, and depending on the type of care you choose it can be more or less affordable. 

As for your mom's major: there's a reason doctors and psychologists shouldn't treat themselves or a family member. It takes some distance to have an objective view on a person and their struggles. And the way you're speaking about your mother makes it seem to me like asking her to draw on her professional knowledge wouldn't work at all. 

To be fair, the psycho-education part might work *especially* well for your mom, as in that that also adresses her feelings as well. A lot of parents of neurodivergent people struggle with feelings of guilt and shame and (self)judgement. To be told by someone else that it is *not* their fault, might actually help. That, in turn, might help her be more open minded about what you need and how she can provide it (like, by allowing you your closet safe space)."

AutisticAdults,ffbo2x7,t3_esl25d,1579775125.0,"""and that if I’m sitting alone in a closet, that’s another issue that needs to be addressed.""

She is right about that one, though not in the sense she'd imagine.

Do you have an official diagnosis yet?

If yes, does she know what autism actually is apart from the things everyone learns about it from popular media? Because I don't think she did. I don't feel she has any idea what sensory overwhelm is, what a meltdown is, and what stimming is. She also doesn't seem to know that autism is a developmental delay in which different parts of a person develop in a different space. Meaning, she shouldn't be treating you like a kid, keeping your stuff hostage and not caring about what you have to say. But she should also understand that even an autistic adult might never develop the emotional coping skills that signal ""maturity"" for a neurotypical and therefore, need a safe space.  Not to mention that in general, *no-one* likes to have their own spaces taken away from them. Not even neurotypicals.

If you have the diagnosis, please take this quote back to your mom and tell her you'd like to address that issue. See if you can both join a ""psycho-education"" course. It is an informative course for autistic people, or relatives of autistic people, to learn about what is means to be autistic, and what autistic people need to thrive. Where I live those courses are usually covered by health insurance. Groups for autistic people and relatives of autistic people are generally separate. 

If she's open to that suggestion, you might even agree on a truce regarding the closet. Like, you get to keep it until the end of the courses and then your mom re-evaluates her decision with all the new information she got (prepare an alternative in the meantime in case she says you cannot keep it!).

If you don't have a diagnosis, start there. Open the conversation the same way, with this quote from your mom. And tell her you'd like to adress that issue. Tell her you think you feel you need that space because you might be autistic and you'd like to get yourself officially assessed to learn how to better cope with the world. Note that that phrase is interpretable multiple ways: your mom will take it as ""you starting to learn to do without the closet"" while you mean it to mean ""learn to deal with the impossible demands mom is imposing on me"". Keep it vague like that, because it will increase the chances your mother will agree with it.

Then too you can suggest a truce, for example until you get a diagnosis, or until you x therapy sessions after diagnosis (because if it isn't autism, then what *is* it?). 

From the moment you get your diagnosis, try to steer your therapist into talking your mom into psycho-education. And try to convince your mom that her following a psycho-education course will really help her to understand you better.


Of course, this all assumes your mom is well-meaning. If she's really super hard headed and doesn't wanna hear any of it, I'd suggest finding an alternative, cutting your losses and preparing to move out asap. Save up money on a bank account your mom can't access, make sure you got important papers like your birth certificate, driver's licence, passports etc. Learn to do all household chores, learn to cook, learn to do taxes. Then when you saved enough (covers at least 6 months of rent and other living expenses), move out and don't give your mom the key to your new place. That will be the only place you'll be completely safe now.

Sounds harsh, that last part. But for some of us that is the only solution."
polyamory,ffbm7wf,t3_esn85o,1579772277.0,"Read up into ""asexual"". It reads to me that for now, Jack want to live an asexual life. This is totally fine and valid of course. But you seem to be a sexual person. And for many sexual people sex and romance go hand in hand. 

Some people fix this with polyamory: the sexual partners can have their needs met by having other romantic and sexual partners.

Some people fix it with an open relationship: the sexual partner can have sex with others, but romantic relationships with others are not on the table. 

For some people this works. But if you feel that you cannot seperate romantic and sexual feelings, and you'd feel your relationship with Jack is not fulfilling you, it would still be very reasonable to break up. 

Sometimes people aren't compatible. And if the incompatibility is on an important thing like sex (and for most people, sex *is* an important part of a romantic relationship), it often is better to break up when there aren't any hard feeling yet. It will be very sad. And very hard, because you will still love each other. 

But sex is usually quite important for sexual people. And to be incompatible in that regard is very sad, but nothing shameful.

So, see first of you could solve it with one of the above options. If that works, you will never have to think about breaking up over this again. But if it doesn't work, and other solutions don't work either, then don't let the relationship limp on until you are up until your ears in bad feelings."

Now is the time to make very hard and big decisions. You still have some time to process the feelings that come with it before the baby is born.

Send those that are judgemental some information on polyamory, tell them you only want them around when they are supportive and you will now only talk to them when they have genuine, non-judgemental questions and want to support you, or it's just for family emergencies (like when somebody dies).

Be clear. Draw a line in the sand and mercilessly follow up with consequenses when people cross your boundaries.

Repeat ad nauseam in an increasingly agitated tone of voice if they still don't get it. Don't let yourself be tricked into explaining in detail. Just stick to ""I don't like that"". 

Honestly though, I tried subtle too, because neurotypicals are all about subtle and polite etc, right? Except they aren't. If you're subtle about your boundaries, they'll just think ""not touching you"" is an option. But it isn't.

And some people *will* keep badgering you about the why's and how's of why you don't like to be touched. Just be blunt with them: ""sometimes you just *know* stuff right? Stop badgering me and just accept I don't wanna be touched."" 
If a person it particularly nasty about it just add a ""and even if I knew why, why tf should I tell *you*? You can't even accept that I don't wanna be touched, why would I trust you with my emotions if you can't even respect my body?""

Don't recommend the last one for any place you need to stay friendly with people, like work. But it might work for a particularly annoying aunt.

Note: I live in the Netherlands. Compared to the States, even our ""subtle"" seems blunt already. Take what you need from my advice and please tweak it in such a way that it'll keep you safe and/or in your bosses good graces etc."

Usually after a night feed and diaper change it is advised to put babe back to bed immediately. No playing and cooing, only soothing to get them back to sleep. 

Then they should wake up about 6-7 am, have some awake time and go down for a nap again until noon-ish.

I am not sure in this case if it would be better to gradually change baby's schedule or just radically change it up. I suppose it depends on baby too. So just try one method for a few days and see if it works. If not, try another way and stick with that for a few days too."

There is no quick fix I fear. Find out where your sensory sensitivities are. Try to find ways to limit input on those senses during the day, each day, every day.

Hell, most people aren't even aware yet that this happened. This, and a lot, lot more. There's an entire [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IIZtz6HyI-bRZs26DwNTWwYtQ_l5R4Il9zj2PKEflas/edit#gid=0) that categorised all posts on this event and the people surrounding it. 

So I don't blame the people that don't know yet or feel discouraged reading in to it. Though I think the links you posted are a good summary of how the Franklin Veaux-controversy started off.

Having said that, I do not recognise myself in this. I am a lucky person to never have experienced abuse up until now. 

The more I read about it though, the more I see it happening to other people. *Poly under duress* as a very common example. Lots of people on this and other poly subs asking for advice, while the story they tell show a partner that just waltzes over boundaries like it's nothing, then tell their partner they ""just have to work through"".

It actually led to me advising *against* doing poly for a lot of people. Not in general, but with the specific partner(s) they're posting about. Or advising to not progress on poly, while they still suffer other mental health conditions. If a case of PTSD has not been treated, how are you gonna know what is an innocent thing triggering your trauma, what is your actual boundary and what is your partner overstepping a boundary? In such a case, doing poly is only detrimental to someone's mental health and *that's not good*. Having a relationship should never be detrimental to someone's health. And learning about abuse, and how abuse happens in poly groups, did help me see it better in posts made here and other places."

It will just build up and turn in a huge shitshow when the pile comes tumbling down.

As for the SAD: if you can't handle it now, it's gonna be worse when you move in. You can't escape it then and if your meta *already* gives you a hard time for choosing to take care of your own health, that's not gonna get better. Of course you can invest in a therapy light for you and her, but in my experience (I have SAD too) it only takes the edge off, it doesn't cure.

This relationship doesn't feel like it's built on solid base of open, respectful communication and working through difficulties together. And if you feel like it'll fall apart wether you move in or call the moving in off, I don't think this relationship can still be saved."
AutisticAdults,feq6z27,t3_eqdbtr,1579338404.0,"It is normal. It is also called not being utterly high on hormones. It is also called ""not ascribing to mononormative norms of what a relationship should be or look like"".

Now I'll just give some background for where I'm coming from regarding relationships, because that is important context considering my opinions about relationships: I am a polyamorous person and currently in 3 long term commited relationships and one fling.

I HATE the ""you're everything to me"" tropes. Like, no pressure there, Claire?! The idea that one person should be able to fulfill all your needs makes me feel nauseated and locked up. That doesn't happen. Ever. Even in the best monogamous relationships people still have friends, and hobbies, and their alone time. All those things fill a need the spouse can't fill. And that is a normal and healthy thing.

As for that, if the relationship makes you happy, makes you feel good, then it is a good relationship. If thinking about your parner makes you smile and you look forward to spending time with them, then it is a good relationship.

As for all those poetic tropes, they aren't needed. Some neurotypicals might also see them as a figure of speech to express love in other ways than ""I love you"" and ""I love you very much"".

My solution is, especially if the other is clearly in the infatuated hormone-ridden phase of ""being in love"" to just let it go. Don't counter, just say ""I love you too"" back in a way that feels authentic to *you*.

As long as the relationship makes you happy, all is fine and dandy. Don't wait with getting into a relationship until you yourself are infatuated. Not everyone gets to feel that way. You might be waiting forever. If what you now have is ""good"", don't break up and wait for ""perfect"". Because ""perfect"" doesn't exist. Infatuation passes and then you're left with reality again."

I'm not gonna stop calling someone ""blonde"" or ""tall"" because they somehow have an irrational reaction to a normal, descriptive word. 

The whole fact that people don't like to be called cis could even be called transphobic. Because the rejection of the word by groups of cis people is mostly based on the usage of the word by the trans\* community (the ""it sounds like cyst"" reason is uncommon, but still childish). If you reject something because it is used by trans\* people, or has to do with being trans\*, or makes you think that normalising trans\* words pathologises being cis, you are being transphobic.
