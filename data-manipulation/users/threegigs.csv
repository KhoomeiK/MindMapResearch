So, you want Hunt to be just like every other game?

No need for caps, man. I have well over 1k hours, I know you get locked in. Everyone knows you get locked in. Which is why going up a ladder can be damned dangerous. Which is why you think hard about the worth of climbing one before you get near the top.

Map hold was meant jokingly, it's a playstyle that's valid, even if it's for wuss-ass snipers that are too afraid to kill a boss (or smart enough not to, since there are so many players who camp outside the lair waiting for the banishing team to run... you decide your own opinion).  But... aside from watching the bounty carriers, why would you ever need to keep the map open for more than a few seconds? Really curious on that point."

No explosive in your consumables? Pass. Why? Because you never know when you might meet another team before you get to your first loot box. If you haven't unlocked frags by level 40, something is wrong.

There are so many ""tells"" to look for in a loadout it's hard to list them all. You may be getting ditched because your loadout is screaming ""not a good hunter"".

Oh, some people also want to play with the same person again, so they keep ditching hoping they'll show up. Stupid, but it happens rarely. Others want to go in solo, and they keep rejecting partners so they can see who they'll be up against in the next match (especially on the non-random contract).

Filters and Discord are both allowed, thus in my opinion are not cheating. Changing the other things you mentioned is NOT allowed.  You're the one using a false equivalency here.

Discord is 'tailoring your communication experience so you can always communicate perfectly (and discreetly)'. Even if you are dead, right next to an enemy, or on the other side of the map. All of which are not built into the game, and which give an advantage to the players who use them versus players who do not.

Same dealio. If you use it, you have an advantage over players who don't. ""It"" can be Nvidia filters (which a large majority of gamers can use) or Discord (TeamSpeak, etc) which is also used by a large majority of gamers.

You begin the game with a strategy. Hardly anyone (IMO) goes into a game thinking that if they don't find the lair straightaway, they'll extract. So as a strategy, No, I don't use it.

Now, as a tactic, yes, I use it as often as the situation presents itself. 

Find the boss at the first clue, and there are shots in a nearby compound? Camp (usually on the side between shots and boss, depends if the shots were fighting or hunters shooting a hive or dogs or something).  

Find the boss relatively early on the second clue on an interior compound (Alice especially)? Camp, even if I don't hear shots. 

Haven't heard a shot all game and it's 15 minutes in? Camp in the 80m circle.

And then some compounds are simply campfests, always (Arden, Lawson and Sweetbell for examples). Arden and Lawson are my favorites, because some good fights evolve as campers try to invade, campers kill other campers, who then kill other campers, etc. It's actually kind of easy to kill the boss at Arden if you start camping inside, as the other campers outside will protect you from being invaded. Getting out is usually just waiting for them to start fighting each other and running off. I prefer being outside on Arden though, much more fun game.

So pretty much, it's not a matter of when you camp, now it's more a matter of whether or not you think you can kill and banish before another team gets to the compound. Games have gone WAY up in time, too. It used to be games were about 25 minutes, now they seem to take 45 unless the boss spawned at the edge right next to an extract."

Dropping off isn't so bad, you simply avoid walking close to edges like I said. Or, if you MUST peek down from an edge, jump out and curve back in (yes, Hunt physics is broken that way, you can turn and even do a u-turn mid-air). For me the bigger issue is jumping UP onto things. Your client thinks you got up, but the server tells you otherwise a moment later.

Sautee thin-sliced (as in lunchmeat thinness or thinner) beef (rib-eye is awesome, but top round is more common).

Combine sauteed beef, onions, lay in a line on your griddle. If you want provolone, put it on top, slice the roll lengthwise almost in half, and unfold over the beef/cheese to help melt the cheese. If you want cheese Whiz, just the roll on top. Scoop the whole thing up with a spatula and flip it over. Now is when you add the Whiz by taking a paint stick dipped in a can of Whiz and wiping it down the middle.

You got teleported down to the porch. Been happening since EA, and it's never going to be fixed. Stay farther from edges. You would have been on the porch no matter what, because you walked off. Only problem is the 1.3 seconds of ambiguity where you didn't know you were down there. So, like I said, don't do that."

You are running. There is a small pre-warning phase where they make almost no sound, and if you run through the pre-aggro radius during that pre-warning phase, you'll trigger them by surprise.

>Many zombies will aggro at the last possible second, then slowly loudly shamble towards me

You were running, then crouched.

Aggro range while running is almost twice that of walking, which is almost twice that of crouching. If you walk or crouch past some AI, then begin to sprint while still in sprint aggro range, of course they will aggro. Just because you walked past them, doesn't mean they won't hear you because the noise you make travels backwards, too."

The very first DLC (Weird sister one) was released on the 27th of August, the same day the game officially released.

So like... when they are in a building doing the boss? But you still need to get in past the other teams camping outside (which is the new meta) and/or get out past those same teams.

>If they engage you, you have your teammates cover you.

Ahh, you play trios with TWO (plural) teammates? So one shotty covered by two rifles, so rifles are still the meta.

>If it is remotely near them, every single player WILL run at the sound of a frag bomb.

Including the guy who threw it, if he's smart. No way will I run after a frag I just threw, and if you're in shotgun range, you're in the range of your own frag. Pistol is the weapon here, not shotgun.

>You not wanting to kill the boss sounds to me like you just play with bad players.

No, it sounds like I know it's not terribly smart play to pin yourself inside a compound, when the guys camping outside (with the meta long rifle) have the advantage of knowing where you have to exit.

I had a few kills tonight with C&K + Mosin, because we pushed some campers prior to killing the boss. But it was the only game out of four that had fighting inside a building. 

Maybe you have a different experience, but most of the fights I'm in are at range, from 30-100 meters, well outside the range of a shotty, even for a followup shot after a sparks hit.

I didn't say shotguns didn't rule CQB, I just said that close-quarters fighting doesn't happen anywhere near as much as it did in the past."
HuntShowdown,fcgemz7,t1_fcepv3a,1577639213.0,"> Shotguns are still great and all are good within their specialties.

I disagree. Shotguns are worthless if you want to actually get the bounty and extract. Crytek has 'adjusted' gameplay now to make them moot. Sure, you can beat the boss, but the campers outside will annihilate you. You can invade boss killers, but the campers outside will annihilate you once again. You *might* manage to surprise players on their way to extraction, but once again, any other player with a rifle will simply plink away at you until you are out of healing or they get a headshot.

Shotguns are no good because the style of gameplay you would use them for is no longer viable."
