you answered with the kids that would be bullied.

so you have yet to give a reason why being a whore is morally wrong. and you'd have to give other reasons why whoreshaming should be brought back just because you think it's immoral. we shouldn't bring shaming for atheism back just because christians think it's immoral, after all."
