when i was shopping on the aca it took me a month to find this plan, and its so great. i had no idea it existed until i found it. and i know its in lots of states because the handbook says all the states have the same plan. its like north caolina, south carolina, alaska, maine. i think texas and massachusetts. i cant remember them all. 103 a month for full dental, vision, and full health coverage and practically no copay and a low deductible. the only things that have high copays are things that dont apply to me. like childbirth and stuff like that. for doctors its like -$50 (yes, they pay me) to see my general practitioner. then like $5 to see a specialist. its like 30% of the er to a max of 1950, and like 15% of hospital stuff to a max of 1950. after 1950 everything is free"

if you make 295 pounds a week in the uk, which is substantially less than i make, that means you are paying the same $103 a month I am right now. And like i said before, I actually pay $82 if you count the savings i get for fulfilling some pretty low hanging fruit perks like not smoking. anyone in the uk who makes more than 295 pounds a week is paying more to the nhs than i am to my insurance. which includes you. 

If you earn more than 548 pounds a week, which is still substantially less than i do, then you are paying more to the nhs than my maxed out disaster payments. the median income is substantially higher than 548 pounds a week.

I’m just curious if it is the europeans whi are jealous that there are americans with cheaper and supeior healthcare, or if its the americans who are jealous that its possible to get cheap affordable healthcare.

$103 a month. Covers everything. dental, vision, specialists. max copay is $1900. oh, and guess what, if you see a doctor you get $50 off your monthly premium and if you watch a 20 minute video in healthy food choices you get another $100 off. if you dont smoke you get another $100 off. That means my annual premium just dropped from 1236 to 986 That means my adjusted monthly premium is $82.  The most i can spend out of pocket is 986+1900 = 2886. That is $240 a month if, and only if, i am forced to pay the entire batch. Thats worst case scenario, kiddos. Now compare that to any european plan, and make sure to note that my effective tax rate is, oh, 22%? And yours is, what? Make sure you add that difference in tax rate when you calculate the price of your healthcare. I really, very much doubt, youre paying less than 2886. and make sure you account for dental+vision+i can see a specialist whenever i damn well please without even needing a referral."

coolguides,ffdgkmt,t1_ffcxenj,1579820418.0,The trick to cooking steak is to always buy steaks that are the exact same size and to practice that way. Once you learn how to cook steaks that are identical to always be the same doneness you can experiment with slightly different sized steaks. make the changes small. Eventually you’ll learn how to cook any steak. You will also learn that with small steaks they should be cooked while cold and with large steaks you cook while room temp. This makes the inside and outside cook at roughly the same speed so everything is the same doneness instead of having rings or a gradient. Ideally you have a crust and everything inside the crust is the same doneness. Thats just a matter of controlling your temperature. Both start temperature and cooking temperature.

>  Though unlikely, bank failures do occur and the FDIC responds in two capacities. First, as the insurer of the bank's deposits, the FDIC pays insurance to depositors up to the insurance limit. Historically, the FDIC pays insurance within a few days after a bank closing, usually the next business day, by either (1) providing each depositor with a new account at another insured bank in an amount equal to the insured balance of their account at the failed bank, or (2) by issuing a check to each depositor for the insured balance of their account at the failed bank.
Some deposits that exceed $250,000 and are linked to trust documents or deposits established by a third party broker may have a short wait so that their accounts can be reviewed to determine the amount of deposit insurance coverage available to them. The amount of time involved depends on how long it takes for the depositor to provide supplemental information to the FDIC so that we can complete the insurance determination.
Second, as the receiver of the failed bank, the FDIC assumes the task of selling/collecting the assets of the failed bank and settling its debts, including claims for deposits in excess of the insured limit. If a depositor has uninsured funds they receive the insured portion of their funds quickly, as described above. They may also, however, recover some portion of their uninsured funds (their remaining claim on the failed bank) from the proceeds from the sale of failed bank assets. It can take several years to sell off the assets of a failed bank. As assets are sold, however, depositors who had uninsured funds usually receive periodic payments (on a pro-rata ""cents on the dollar"" basis) on their remaining claim.

politics,fem3qfq,t1_fem3n0i,1579238747.0,"the court making definitive judgements as a default absolutely in no possible way is the ideal

it is actually the worst case scenario.

it means that if a court feels conflicted on something and has no real opinion it automatically creates binding legal precedent that lasts decades or centuries. that is the worst thing that can possibly happen"

politics,fem133b,t1_felp9gw,1579236340.0,"this is how you fix it.  every senator, the president, and vice president all get to nominate 5 people each. Each nominee who gets at least 30 votes from senators who arent in the same party go into an eligibility pool. So for example if a republican nominates someone, then 30 democrats have to vote for them. And if a democrat nominates someone, that means 30 republicans have to vote for them.  Once you have 100 eligible people, you randomly select one. The other 99 can never be nominated ever again and the pool is emptied. The selected person becomes a supreme court justice for 36 years and then is kicked out."

If you want to get rid of authoritarianism you do it by hunting down every authoritarian in your country and getting rid of them.

People have protection from the government, and police are the government. There is no reason to give police that same protection. There should be absolutely no mercy in how police are handled, they should live in constant fear of misbehavior, knowing any small mistake is the end of their life."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,feg903x,t1_feg8fc1,1579082821.0,"When you represent the government, you get treated like the government. Cops are not individuals, they are servants.

Citizens are guaranteed protection from the government, but the government is not shielded from itself."

That should be the standard. The cop should not have access to ‘innocent until proven guilty.’ Civilians are innocent until proven guilty. Cops claim they aren't civilians, so fine that means you’re guilty until proven innocent."
