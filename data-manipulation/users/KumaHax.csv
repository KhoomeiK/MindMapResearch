AskReddit,ffefi7i,t3_et0asi,1579846035.0,"Okay so this is one of the stories I have that still make me go ""ew wtf"".
So at the beginning of last year's semester I did an introduction seminar for the new students so they can get the hang of things and answer any questions they may have. At that time I was working as a teacher in my university as I was still wrapping things up with my masters degree. 
Anyway, there was this one girl who is the outspoken type that is the main center piece of this hot garbage of a story. 
I finish the seminar and she approaches me for more information about classes and such.

First impressions is that she seemed polite and also looked like she was one of those over achievers type of people (not that there is something wrong with that). 

Anyway, she kept coming to me for advice almost every day and then the advice turned into conversations which turned to be very uncomfortable. 
She would start off saying how she didn't like her parents and that she was thinking of leaving home and crashing with friends, I told her to simply focus on her studies. 
She kept coming day after day with the same topic and started to insinuate that she could stay with me in my house because ""things seem to be great between us"". 

I honestly didn't know how to react to that because I kept things pretty professional with how I spoke with her and all of my replies were short and simple, I obviously said no. (the last thing I need is this in my life)

A week passed and she came back and she was crying saying horrible things about her parents and how she was thinking of ""hurting them"", here I was a bit worried because I didn't know if she truely meant it or it was because her emotions were effected by the situation with her parents, she asked me for a hug and I gave her a pat on the back and left. 

I woke up the next day with a lengthy email from her saying that she felt that ""I"" had a crush on her and that she felt that it would be best to clear the air because it was inappropriate etc etc etc. 
I replied and told her that I have no interest in her and that I kept things as professional as I can and treated her just like I treat everyone else. 

She came to my office first thing in the morning and she started by apologizing for the ""misunderstanding"", but that soon changed as she started by saying why I had no interest in her, and is it because there was something wrong with her. 
Obviously it was because I had no interest, and I don't know maybe because it's unethical and I will get fired (also because I just had a divorce, raising a child and I'm also gay lol). 

I just told her that it's not right to think that way of students and it's just wrong. 
Now here I thought she was self-conscious because she said ""is there something wrong with me"" (referring to herself) 
But wait, it gets better, because she literally said that everyone secretly likes her and brought back the topic of how i had a crush on her. 

Here I sort of lost my cool and raised my voice and basically repeated what I said earlier and also stated that maybe we should take this conversation to the department because it's getting out of hand. 
She refused, apologized and left. 
I got an email from her at the end of the semester with her saying that she just wanted my attention because she liked how comfortable I made her feel and how kind I was with her and that she mistook that for me liking her but she also said that she likes me. 
I honestly was just doing my job and to be honest I hated her guts. She would always talk crap about my co-workers and other students, was super disrespectful to her parents and is obviously very messed up. 
This whole situation doesn't end here as I ended up getting called by another coworker just to be told that there was an ""anonymous"" student who told her that I was being overly flirtatious with them and that the department wants to talk to me about it. They take this sort of behavior very seriously and anyone can easily get fired for it. Luckily my boss knows me very well and I had the emails to back up my side of the story. 
Unfortunately she was let off with a warning. 

She still tries to come and talk to me but I brush her off by pretending to be busy."

My ex used to enjoy spending some alone time every Saturday morning to rewind from stress and anxiety, so I made sure to pack her a basket filled with all the things she loved and left it there by the bed (tea, her favorite mug, comic books and cheesy jokes). Small things like these show that you actually care about them."
