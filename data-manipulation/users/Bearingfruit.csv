When I was being treated for depression I was sent into a mania by the effexor. Retried it a few years later with my new diagnoses of bipolar with added ability and haven't had any problems."
bipolar,ffeltzd,t3_et5ahp,1579853569.0,I can still remember vivid night terrors I had as a child from over twenty years ago and there were many of them.
bipolarart,ffelgrp,t3_et5udu,1579853081.0,Loving this :)
Schizotypal,ff2yw8w,t3_ercdfv,1579529023.0,Yeah I feel this.  For me it's perfectionism in a way. I either do something right or not at all because I shut down. I am very sensitive to correction. Because I try so hard sometimes.
bipolar,ff2yn0s,t3_ercnm1,1579528794.0,"When I worked I got up 3-4 hours ahead of time to get 'ready'.
I can get up and out of bed somewhat easily (dogs want outside first thing in the morning) but then I just move to the couch."

I too think bipolar and mental illness folk in general add quite a bit of that glitter you speak of!"

bipolar,ff1sm77,t1_ff1dcbn,1579485270.0,Not exactly a named technique... You could call it abstract pointillism I suppose?
bipolar,ff1sj7b,t1_ff15n8o,1579485216.0,I have heard of him. Must be the eyes :) they use to be my favourite when I was back in highschool (a decade ago) something must have stuck ahah
bipolar,ff1sed4,t1_ff0ohkr,1579485131.0,Thanks :)
bipolar,ff0nzr2,t1_ff08cgz,1579470631.0,No I didn't go to a treatment center I didn't know at the time that was an option. I never think I am as bad as I am. Wishing I had though because I wrecked havoc on my life. Expressive therapy sounds like my gig too :)
bipolar,ff0ndkj,t1_ff0c80u,1579470528.0,Thanks :)

bipolar,ff06td8,t1_fezwsxy,1579465782.0,"Thank you!!

I definitely do feel like I am in a trance. I put music on and the hours just slip by. It's a calm escape from all of my emotions. I use to focus on perfection too much with my art and then I had a mental breakdown and it's let me enjoy the process of creating again. I cherish the time I have to paint."
bipolar,fezvf02,t1_feztkk0,1579462163.0,"That's so sweet of you! 
I had a pretty minor art show in highschool (a decade ago) but nothing since. Only got back into art about two years ago after years of heavy depression. One day Id like to show my art but I wouldn't even know where to start in my city."
bipolar,fezv39s,t1_feztaif,1579462041.0,"Hah I don't really know, it takes several days and a few hours at a time multiple times a day. So a good chunk of time. I will clock my next piece and find out."

bipolar,fezkuhq,t1_fezi7iv,1579458392.0,:) thanks so much! If only I could get decent photos/scans of my work.
bipolar,fezkr4h,t1_fezhyeh,1579458360.0,Wish it would've been creepier but I will work on that :)

alcoholicsanonymous,fetekdk,t1_fertck6,1579374609.0,I didn't realize how hard this accepting I am powerless over alcohol thing would be. I thought I understood it but I clearly haven't.
alcoholicsanonymous,fetdpbg,t1_fespyrm,1579374304.0,"Well that's my worry. I haven't picked up a drink but my brain keeps thinking ""one day in the far future maybe I can drink again"" and I can't tell if it's the disease talking or a normal mind thinking. Thanks for your reply."
alcoholicsanonymous,fepkluz,t3_eqbult,1579322951.0,"I am here for incoming comments.

I too am on week 5 of my sobriety and am questioning if this was all just blown out of proportion mainly due to my anxiety and depression. I got a sponsor but they've been busy and continue to change our meeting dates. So I still haven't even done step one 'properly' I've done what I can by myself for the first three steps. Read the Big Book, Living Sober and Twelve steps and Twelve traditions. I certainly see value in these books to leading a better life and being a better person so for sure I want to work on that. 
Maybe I am saying this because I haven't hit rock bottom yet? I can't afford to hit rock bottom a month ago was the lowest I could let myself. But I haven't hurt anyone other than myself."
bipolar,feo1thk,t1_feo0wxt,1579294023.0,"Yes. Sweets. I am widely known to have a massive sweet tooth. I assumed it had to do with some sort of self-soothing, but could never explain the reason for nighttime eating. 

I will try and eat healthy food and will eat an entire meal and then still not be satisfied till I eat copious sweets.

Maynard's big bags of candy was on sale for $1 each and there was a limit to buy 25. So I went multiple times. That's how crazy my sweet tooth is. I am relatively healthy I swear ahahah"
bipolar,feo0fb9,t3_eq5jth,1579293484.0,I didn't know this was common with bipolar. I struggle with this harddd. Gonna add this to the list of things I thought were personality traits/habits which turn out to be part of this disorder.
bipolar,fenzxqp,t3_eq5ta7,1579293211.0,That's gorgeous! ❤️
bipolar,febhj92,t1_febfe8i,1578958826.0,Yeah he liked the counsellor and the session. And yes we have another appointment for a month from now. It was a relief when they told us to just forget about sex until were more emotionally stable. Made me feel like I had more time to get better.
bipolar,febg05k,t1_feai5tl,1578958428.0,"Thanks for your response.
No one ended up getting blamed, but I wouldn't mind having my husband read those books because it definitely couldn't hurt.
Sorry you had a bad experience with couples counselling. I know that that happens because when I've brought my husband into see my personal therapist she kind of did that to him which is why we did couples counselling at another place altogether."
bipolar,febertb,t1_fea01zk,1578958119.0,"Thank you, things did see to go well the counsellor was smart and empathic towards our situation and no one was blamed."
bipolar,febehym,t1_fea2572,1578958034.0,"Thanks for your response.
I am afraid you're right I didn't exactly deal with my grief very well but at first it wasn't from the drinking. I actually didn't drink after his surgery and during his treatment I started drinking heavily again once he was doing better. 

The therapy session turned out pretty good. They didn't blame either one of us. And says we seem to be working on what were capable of changing. And we're making positive strides. They did say there's no need to prioritize intimacy since we have many other things like our mental health and physical health that are currently higher priority."
bipolar,fe3zqbe,t3_enqdke,1578854410.0,"I initially went in for depression. I'd been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for a bit. Was told it was depression and general anxiety disorder. Nothing made me feel better. I didn't think much about the mania because I didn't know what to look for. But then the manias got worse. I tried to buy a house in another province that I hadn't even physically seen, I slept with A LOT of people sometimes multiple different guys a day. Then I went into more deep depression. Then bought a house with someone I was dating for 3 months (were married now and all but still) it wasn't until my husband's cancer diagnoses where I went into a mania from stress that my therapist and psychiatrist saw the bipolar loud and clear. I wasnt expressing proper emotions for the situation. Then I started hallucinating and finally thanks to abilify stopped the craziness."
bipolar,fe3yq5k,t3_enqfli,1578854070.0,"I've gain 25 pounds but I am eating healthier, not over eating and starting to walk more. Next step is the treadmill. 

I understand why gaining weight bugs me. But I also understand that out sanity is more important than the skin bag we walk around in. 

The stupid part, are you feeling overly sedated?
I couldn't read more than a couple sentences and retained nothing. But then we adjusted my meds. And I am better at reading/recollection/wit, not perfect but functional."
alcoholicsanonymous,fe3xqv8,t3_enqkxr,1578853841.0,"I have trouble coming up with things too (35 days sober)
A fellow recovery alcoholic told me to start a puzzle so that is what I am going to do today. Sounds lame I know. But I will try anything.

Also:
Journalling, walking outdoors, making crafts, playing video games.

I've also moved furniture around, painted the house, hung up pictures, bought plants to care for etc etc."
bipolar,fe3x296,t3_enqqjm,1578853621.0,"This happens to me too on meds. And sometimes I long for the mania and freedom my brain had to create art. I feel guilty when not creating something because I feel it is what I need to do for my sanity. The reading thing is hard. Adjustment of meds has helped a little. What I do is journal. You've probably heard it before but it really works. Keeps your mind and hand focused relieving energy. And you don't have to remember what you wrote just keep going. And when I have nothing to say I just write over and over again ""I have nothing to say, I have nothing to say"" for a while and eventually something comes up. 
I got that 'i have nothing to say' thing from an artist's self help book years ago and it stuck."
bipolar,fe3vla0,t3_enpz4d,1578853246.0,I can't cut the obsessions. They go away with medication adjustments usually for me. And if not I bounce from obsession to obsession. Generally when I find something new and exciting I worry it's going into hypomania. Because average me doesnt get excited about much.
bipolar,fe3usnx,t3_enp9hc,1578853106.0,"Even when I think I could sleep without Trazadone (plus my nightly routine) I take my meds because changing sleep patterns is a trigger for me and I think most of us with bipolar. To me it does sound like you're already in hypomania. Like previous post, contact your pill doctor/psychiatrist whatever. I know it seems like a light at the end of he tunnel but if it is hypomania and you do nothing you could end up doing something that hurts you or the ones you love."
bipolar,fe3ew38,t3_eni772,1578848672.0,"I think the feeling fragile part is normal when people first rent their own place, there's more responsibility plus a new job. Are you making time for yourself?"
bipolar,fe3d2l2,t3_eni9fb,1578848197.0,"As someone with bipolar who recently discovered they are an alcoholic, I cringe a bit reading this because it could've been written by me. I self-medicated for a long time with alcohol and weed and whatever was available. I am now over a month sober. Been feeling down, but I sure don't miss the way alcohol made me feel the next few days. If your finding you can't control your drinking or often have to think about drinking like 'normal' people. I would suggest that you might need to cut back/quit. Alcoholism is a progressive illness. Meaning it might not be that bad yet but it can turn that way."
ptsd,fdxmujq,t3_enbnf0,1578770737.0,"I get this. I don't even know how to explain it to my husband and I don't know how to get past it. I also don't feel comfortable naked too.

I'm here for others' replies."
bipolar,fdx5hnc,t3_ena162,1578765531.0,For me the pressure not to disappoint my husband is huge. But even still I spend money I don't have but not nearly as bad as when I was on the wrong medications. I realized shopping is soothing to my anxiety. So when I start online shopping I fill my cart with everything I want and then I exit the page and start on another store. I get the thrill without the guilt. 99 % of the time the things I want to buy aren't necessary. So I try to think about living minimally. I think about the planet and the waste I am creating etc.
alcoholicsanonymous,fdsyww5,t3_en11ye,1578709753.0,"I understand where you're coming from. I too feel this disconnect to people. Even when other people have already connected to me I don't feel the same it feels fake. I've felt like that for a long time and was one of the reasons I drank. For me I do want those connections so I just kept trying, showing up and being friendly and eventually the real connection begins. 
I am not saying force yourself into uncomfortable situations all the time or anything just saying for me it gets better with time. I either end up developing a connection (not like 'i love you and admire you' more like 'yeah were cool') or I become more comfortable on my own. You don't always have to be making connections.
Do what helps you stay sober."
alcoholicsanonymous,fdsxl5b,t3_emp5i5,1578709258.0,I am 34 days sober. And I certainly get the fear. Sometimes it's from waking up from a bad drunk dream. Sometimes it's just when I'm anxious in public and I have to double check that I am not drunk by going over everything I remember about the day up to that point. But my memory has deceived me before so that doesn't always work.
bipolar,fdseay1,t3_emzeja,1578700722.0,I found out I was bipolar a few months after getting married. I doubt we will get divorced. But then again my husband has stage 4 brain cancer and is expected to only live a few years. So we don't have enough time to hate each other.
bipolar,fdp2779,t3_emj4tm,1578618236.0,That's horrible I feel for you. You must tell the psychiatrist for them to be able to help! Maybe write a note and leave it on their desk discreetly at the end of the next appointment (like have your mom walk out first or something).
bipolar,fdp1x0j,t3_emj6q4,1578618044.0,Brushing my teeth.
bipolar,fdk7faz,t1_fdk18yd,1578497792.0,"The above.
My first psychiatrist was all the red flags above and I didn't know it could be different until he discharged me and my therapist was like ""??? What why???"" And she got me a new one who is to say the least, amazing. I trust her completely, and she trusts and respects my opinion on my medications.

Our sessions are minimum 45 minutes if I am not feeling chatty.
HE was hard and cold. And slipped up twice where he got me confused with another patient. Just plain wasn't listening.
And he didn't really give me a choice on meds. He actually made me feel like not taking them at all.

So don't lose hope. There ARE kind psychiatrists."
