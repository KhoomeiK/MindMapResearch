Rodney certainly had character development, that sketching in of detail but he also had personal development. He is one of the characters that grew more as a person. 

For example, Sam certainly develops and matures over the series but she is more or less the same person and views the world from the same perspective as she did at the beginning. She didn't didn't have to change her personality because she was already in her element, right where she was meant to be.  


When Rodney encounters Sam Carter and later John Shepard he is confronted with people that he thinks shouldn't be as smart as him, but they continue to show that not only can they do things he couldn't even think of but that if he had been listen to and not them, he and many others would be dead.
