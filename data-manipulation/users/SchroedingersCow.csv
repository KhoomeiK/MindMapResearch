depression,fec59c4,t3_enrs4c,1578966850.0,"Yes, I feel this. I feel like if I dare say anything I'm being so stereotypically attention seeking and that people I know will react out of obligation and think 'oh here we go' and I'd rather not impose that on anyone. I'd rather just disappear and make it easy on all of us"
CasualConversation,fec3nlo,t3_eoe0n3,1578966177.0,That's very cool of you. I've been cleaning house giving away a lot of stuff and it feels good to make someone's day like that
CasualConversation,fe8w8hw,t3_eo5rjt,1578931739.0,"Yes. Honestly I'd like to drop everything and go to Montana, in the wild where nobody will find me. Morbid but I'd like to die there and just drop off the map."
SuicideWatch,fe88swy,t1_fe6895g,1578923819.0,"Thanks - I actually do this now and again. It's surprisingly difficult to get every idea and feeling that feels so clear in your head into actual sentences that can go on paper, but it does sometimes help to quiet my mind if I can sort through everything in there and make sense of it"
SuicideWatch,fe67afm,t1_fe5xacp,1578883389.0,"No because I might never stop. I'm not going to make anyone listen to me whine any more than I already have, but I appreciate it. Just all runs though my head endlessly, I can't even sleep most nights and some nights it's unbearable and I just want to shut everything up for good"
SuicideWatch,fe66wy6,t1_fe5xea7,1578883149.0,It sounds cliche but I can't even think of anything that makes me happy right now. Maybe my cats. Animals are so innocent
selfharm,fe5w90t,t3_enreox,1578876351.0,"She is the best kind of person. I understand how hard it is for you to open up, and I understand how hard it is for her to do what she does. You both are awesome."
depression,fe5vbpc,t3_cml6ni,1578875763.0,"The other day at work I found out that a lot of my fears of how I'm perceived and what my coworkers think of me are true, and it's a fucking nail in the coffin. I don't know how much more I can take. I just don't see what is wrong with me but clearly it's something. They could replace me if I disappeared, it would hurt them (not the people but finding someone to do what I do) but ultimately they'd replace me with someone who isn't me, but who is better than me."
AskReddit,fcp5s5x,t1_fcp2k24,1577851382.0,Hey best of luck to you!!
AskReddit,fcp5r6a,t1_fcp0g7s,1577851356.0,"What? Dying is your 2040 goal? That's much too long to wait, I made that my 2020 goal"
depression,fcj956e,t3_ehbh7p,1577680366.0,"I feel that. I have been so close to relapse into self harm (again), I'm thinking about it so strongly I dreamt about it last night and woke up with such strong urges I wanted to scream. I feel like a fake, like I have no right to feel this way, and I'm absolutely ashamed about it."
selfharm,fcj8xlf,t3_eh35hr,1577680230.0,"I'm happy for you, that is awesome. Seriously. I hope we can all get there some day"
depression,fb9drj5,t3_ebp2dh,1576635952.0,"Hell I feel this way about myself. I feel like a fraud, like I have no excuse to want to drive my car off a bridge, and that I should grow the hell up. And yet, here I am"
