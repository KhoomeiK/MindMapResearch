Ya know, I have a mix chihuahua and I was walking with him, (yes on leash as always)  ran into two huge Pitts. I scoop up my Pooky (his name) while two Pitts looking at my dog like candy. I had to avoid the dog by turning away from them. The ""owner"" yelled at the dogs to come back but they did not listened. meanwhile, I am walking away holding my Pooky. I yelled at him for not letting the dog on the leash as I walked away. I do have a pitfall mix at home, and she was sick at the time. I don't judge but I will judge people if they do not follow the rules."

I never wanted to go to bed and my stomach get all twisted (nerves). I would not even look at the news, any solders, and or army vehicles and at the same time, I was afraid of death fearing I'm a bad person that I am going to hell. This is when I was about 7-8 years old. 

Ps. I'm deaf (F45)."

AskReddit,fd3ogx1,t1_fd0sxkm,1578160282.0,"Oh my gosh. My daughter was about 11-12 and my son was two years older. They went to neighborhood. My son came back saying that my daughter got stuck in the toddler's swings. Her legs got stuck, and you cannot pry them out. We use oil, soap or whatever we could find (meanwhile, I was video taped this, cuz it was too funny). She wasn't in pain tho, so she ok. My boyfriend had to go back to the apartment to get a wire cutter to cut the toddler's swing. Wanna know their names? Kimberly (named after my twin sis) and Jonathan (name after father). I really thought one of my kids wrote this story!"
