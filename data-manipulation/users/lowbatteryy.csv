depression,ffe9xm9,t1_ffe9u1q,1579840781.0,Honestly maybe that would be best to tell her. How do you think she might react?
depression,ffe99l7,t1_ffe8hkk,1579840219.0,I’m surprised she hasn’t offered to help you more. Maybe the two of you could come up with a plan to tell your mom?
vegan,ffe6gdh,t3_et4ujf,1579837960.0,What the fuck. Gag
depression,ffe3lrt,t3_et4c0p,1579835811.0,Your post does not seem like you made it up for attention. It sounds like you’re really struggling and need help. It sounds like you care for your family. Would you ever consider talking to a school counselor about your feelings and thoughts of suicide? I know it’s hard but help is better than suffering in silence. Reach out to me it you want to talk.

Anxiety,ffb7jf8,t1_ffb748n,1579753997.0,When I looked it up it says that a panic attack has more physical symptoms than an anxiety attack and is worse basically but to me they seem interchangeable.

depression,ff58hf0,t1_ff58enb,1579583361.0,That sounds great. I hope it goes well for you and sending you good vibes to get you through it. Good luck.
depression,ff586s0,t1_ff57lxn,1579583090.0,You’re not too weak to still be hurting at all. I can tell you that your wife will not respond in anything but love and support. It really helps to have your feelings on the outside and not only on the inside. I think putting what you’ve been through here is the first step to being able to talk about it and for it to get better. Maybe you could write it out to her in an email or text? Or tell her that you’re struggling with something without telling her the details? I’m sure she will be there to support you either way.
depression,ff57jj6,t3_erpn3s,1579582518.0,You just described exactly how I feel. I can only hope it gets better with therapy and medication. I’m so worried it won’t though. I’m sorry I know this isn’t any advice or anything but I feel the same way.
depression,ff575g7,t1_ff56r3p,1579582177.0,I know how you feel. I’ve felt this way. It is completely normal. For me it really helped me to tell my friends. I still haven’t told a therapist yet but it helps telling a friends where you feel like you’re in a safe place with their friendship.
depression,ff56hry,t3_erpcxn,1579581617.0,I’m sorry this happened to you. Have you tried to work through it in therapy or talk to anyone about it?
