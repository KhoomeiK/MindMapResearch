YouShouldKnow,ffgh0ry,t1_fffb7qz,1579906041.0,"Travel work should never, ever be beneath 20/hr. I'm not in the O&G field, but I travel frequently for work (year round construction). I'm only gone 4-5 days a week because I got lucky. A lot of younger workers like it, but people with spouses or children do not. I cannot count how many divorced men I work with that are on the road 50 weeks/yrs. So, buyer beware - the road is not for the feint of heart."
politics,ff82xgr,t1_ff79j1e,1579664580.0,I'd say it's the minimum to not be able to afford to die because you cannot pay for your own funeral.
politics,ff7w49a,t1_ff7r8o5,1579659761.0,I work in a very wealthy city. The housing is outrageous so I make a very long commute. The shop clerks here are very hard to find. Popeyes advertises $15/hr for a fry cook. The local Subway is randomly closed sometimes because they cant find anyone to work for low wages.
wikipedia,ff7q4d5,t1_ff684ur,1579655628.0,I think you may have missed the point.
wikipedia,ff6r3vv,t1_ff6pg2p,1579633124.0,"Yep, I read that one. I can never tell when Abbey is telling the truth about his life but theres an article about the Schlitz cans online."
wikipedia,ff60xrl,t3_erstp7,1579616306.0,"This guy was wild, a different kind of environmentalist. He has a great story about driving down the highway out west chucking Schlitz cans out of the window. He said that he always litters on highways because it's not the cans that are ugly, it's the highway that is ugly."
WorkplaceSafety,feryyh7,t1_ferlmpi,1579359799.0,Be careful with that one. You then have an HR note that says you complained about something very small. Ask yourself if you were a manager within your company if you would want to transfer or promote an internal candidate to be your direct report that reports minor issues to HR.
Workbenches,fee9mr0,t3_eoew9f,1579029249.0,I picked up the little garage roller by kobalt. I dont recommend that one. The plate on the bottom that holds stuff gets in the way of your feet.
guitars,fe2qq55,t1_fdxcn9a,1578841845.0,That's awesome. I was in Hartford last month. I'll check it out next time I'm there.
guitars,fdwpq5p,t1_fdsymd3,1578761190.0,What part of the country do you live in? Silver faces around the east coast here are pricey.
engineering,fdwpjtq,t1_fdthft4,1578761136.0,In my experience it does. I'm not saying it works like this everywhere else or anything. Just my 2 cents.
guitars,fdsxi7e,t1_fdsmrik,1578709225.0,"Damn, your just missing a blackface Super and you are set. I hear those Supers are great next to windows, haha"
WorkplaceSafety,fdsnvnb,t3_emvtrz,1578705661.0,"I'm a safety guy. This may be a de minimus violation per OSHA, but your company is hiring professionals to rid themselves of the problem. So, IMO OSHA will do nothing after your boss shows them the documentation of hiring pros to fix the problem. Sorry for the luck, sounds gross."
Economics,fds4dxz,t1_fdqxcl2,1578694109.0,"I remember Chomsky talked about a Greek  system just before WWI that was in his eyes, balanced. Basically, the workers owned the means of production. It was inspiring to hear about it before it was crushed by war - one can only hope it happens again."
Economics,fds3wyp,t3_emrehp,1578693861.0,How is NOT 99%? HOW?
AskReddit,fdrl5vp,t1_fdqsvhg,1578686107.0,The quality of lego is unbeatable. They are amazing in that every lego piece ever made will fit with every new lego piece.
engineering,fdr7dym,t1_fdqq2id,1578680546.0,This can actually work if you could somehow fund it. It worked really well in Greece? I think before WWI. The owners were kicked out and the workers ran the company.
engineering,fdr762a,t1_fdqnzst,1578680429.0,"I'm not an engineer, but would certainly pay for something that I use regularly (that's key) that will last a lifetime. Thing is, you only get me once as a customer, but I sing your praises for my lifetime."
engineering,fdqw1zj,t1_fdqotzo,1578675629.0,"Beats me how that does or does not work. It's just my experience. Also, we do not go into detail about anything potentially incriminating in written word - it is all very vague in emails, etc. Everything of meaning is verbal or even non-verbal. I'll explain what I mean by non-verbal - you send an email marked high importance to top brass asking for $ to fix a major problem or something, they dont respond for weeks sometimes. Eventually, you write to them to say that ""I take your lack of response to mean agreement on such and such expenditure"" and after a few days of silence, you've got your answer."
Plumbing,fdqiy17,t3_emqx6w,1578667810.0,"Gravity is, just like a theory man."
engineering,fdqif4r,t1_fdqhcnb,1578667447.0,"I'm no lawyer either. I'm just a grunt - sorta. The company I work for is fortune 100, so I figure these lawyer folks know way more than I ever will. That's why we ALWAYS have legal counsel in meetings about potential issues before they're even allowed to take place. They have plenty of input and usually buck conventional financial wisdom to do the right thing - usually."
engineering,fdqhxl7,t1_fdqgnv9,1578667105.0,"You'd think it would be that way right? But it's not. It's fully a preemptive strategy when any potential issue is raised, internal to the company or external from customers. The lawyers I work with get hundreds of emails per day."
engineering,fdqeij9,t3_emqjiq,1578664585.0,"It all doesnt come out in discovery. Just make the title of the email ""attorney client privilege"" and CC your general counsel. There's some fancy lawyerin' involved, but that shit will never see daylight. Source: I am sometimes required to do this at work."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdj4r2e,t3_elljdf,1578458411.0,"I spent an hour reading about this. TRex, according to actual paleo-pros was the apex predator of its time, moved fast and had few if any feathers."
todayilearned,fd31ty5,t1_fd2t4ub,1578153918.0,"This mindset is infuriating to me with the media I see. Males are shown to be reckless, impulsive bumbling idiots. I call bullshit."
todayilearned,fczcfa8,t3_ejj6z3,1578098117.0,I wonder what a bank exec's health insurance cap is after 20 surgeries?
todayilearned,fcz1td4,t1_fcywyye,1578091959.0,"It's definitely not bullshit, especially if you live in the country. You're kidding yourself. Your CCTV and security measures do jackshit when you're out of town."
HomeImprovement,fcyxmfo,t1_fcyonkv,1578089325.0,"I would also cancel the contract with your FIL. In the flooring business, customers will get down on their hands and knees for the first time in 50 years to inspect things. If you have to look for a problem, there isnt one."

Tools,fcyw1mu,t3_ejhqjo,1578088325.0,"Now, that's a real work bench."
todayilearned,fcyv7rw,t1_fcy3hf7,1578087801.0,My old man taught me that locks on doors only keep the honest man out - this is an odd twist to that.
AskReddit,fcxk4t3,t1_fcwq0zi,1578064900.0,"I remember reading years ago that their names were chosen from cool sources: John Calvin, the protestant; Thomas Hobbes, the philosopher; and  Miss Wormwood, the junior demon from The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis."
AskReddit,fcxjt3q,t1_fcwzu6z,1578064680.0,I feel the same way. Seems like we are closer to the author's ideas without all the garbage punctuation on the page.
AskReddit,fcxjnk0,t1_fcwoain,1578064572.0,"McCarthy is my favorite author and a lot of it has to do with his style. Punctuation is only necessary when we dont form well thought out sentences. Also, it's like he took Hemingway's style to the upper limit."
AskReddit,fcxjg58,t1_fcw87p7,1578064430.0,The 2nd half of the book is not nearly as good for me. I read it 20 years ago and I still remember missing the letters from Jonathan in the first half.
AskReddit,fcxj704,t1_fcwn83f,1578064254.0,"The story where the guy wakes up in the bed with the angry Martian at his bedside is awesome. I'd also like to add ""All You Zombies"" by Heinlein."
todayilearned,fcutfjz,t3_eiqfiw,1577988145.0,Being back this law for companies' that shrink their product packaginging and add more air than weight.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fcpffa3,t1_fcnnw4c,1577861610.0,"Exactly, I fly quite a bit for work and I hate every moment of it. I would rather drive 10 hours than step foot in airport and I do that frequently when the boss okays it."
union,fcnrryt,t1_fcn43e6,1577817195.0,Agreed. Hes by far the worst candidate for me.
