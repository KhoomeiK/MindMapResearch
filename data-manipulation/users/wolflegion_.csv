These were supplemented/supported by local militia’s if needed. For example during the civil war, 97% of the union army came from militia’s and volunteers. And so in case of a small localised rebellion, it would probably be the local militia that was used to shoot it down, because it took too much time to ship in regular army.

It also helps make sense of why people say that 2A was intended to provide people with weapons to fight of tyrannical governments. At the time that was feasible, because militia’s were much larger than the regular army."
