Our cat hates any type of noise created by plastic (bags, clingwrap, stickytape) and if I open the cutlery drawer he will leave the room straight away."

2: laughing at someone who is upset by this experience is flat out cruel. ""Omg, I can't believe you have empathy for squirrels! How lame."""

Got train, then stopped at Jolimont for 20 mins. Told to get off train and wait for bus replacement. Waited another 20 with no sign of a stopping bus. 
Tram back to city. Tram up street. Get on another tram for about 45 mins.
Get off tram to find boom gates down and buses diverted to god knows where ! 
Get on next tram, get off and there is my bus! 
Frantically wave driver down AND HE STOPS!!
Get off at normal bus stop, RAIN HAS STOPPED!
