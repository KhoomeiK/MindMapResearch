corgi,ffaqgox,t3_esh92p,1579742093.0,"Corgi puppies require a lot of work. They have a ton of energy. Is your mom willing to take time out to play with him while you are at school and take him out to pee?  You would also need to have time after school to play with him, walk him and take him out several times for potty training.  Getting a corgi puppy would probably involve the whole family helping.     P.S. I would suggest crate training, as this is the best way to teach them not to potty in the house."
corgi,ff7fxhz,t3_erwl6p,1579648637.0,Every vet I have asked agrees that Purina Pro Plan is a good food. I have found it at both Petsmart and PetCo. I suggest slowly switching to one of them and feeding 1 cup in the morning and 1 in the evening.  I wouldn’t go with cheap food as it is filled with unhealthy fillers and can cause health problems down the road.
todayilearned,ff78hpj,t1_ff5w82v,1579643202.0,"The husband told my parents that he had a bear before they were married. But my parents have no idea if they could not have kids or lost a child. They didn’t interact with them much partially because the couple wanted others to acknowledge the bears and say “hi” to them. Of course, my parents found them strange and mostly avoided them."
todayilearned,ff5oeni,t1_ff5ntmp,1579603168.0,"My parents had neighbors that had stuffed bears that they took out to restaurants, movies or really any place. They talked about them as if they were their children. I wonder if there is some kind of specific mental disorder with adults that pretend toys are real (alive). I guess that I should say that the people had jobs and appeared to otherwise function normally."

Well, no... it was a lot more painful than that. Fortunately, that was a few years ago and now he has a perfect smile."

AskReddit,feg3fkz,t3_eoz1k2,1579075198.0,"The way you talk to yourself in your head is important. Thinking “I’m so stupid, ugly or boring” effects you more than you think. People buy into their self talk, so try changing your self talk to be more positive. List positive things about yourself or your life. The more you do this the better you will feel."
AskReddit,feg26z3,t1_feg1x13,1579073701.0,"I was thinking maybe in the US you might be prone to eating more junk food with sugar in it that you didn’t eat while in Vietnam. 
Also, as an unusual side note, when I was a teenager and we would visit my grandparents any acne I had would really clear up. I later realized that the well water at their house had a lot of natural sulfur in it which is antibacterial."
AskReddit,feg1qoh,t1_feg1jqy,1579073171.0,I really wonder what it is. Could it be less sugar?  Or less stress? I can’t imagine what else would be different.
AskReddit,fefzson,t1_feff0aa,1579070929.0,I bet you didn’t have dairy products in Vietnam. That might be the difference?

corgi,feehmz9,t1_fedtpkj,1579033933.0,"I would never say corgis are aggressive. Opinionated- yes, but all three I have had/have are very kind even toward children.  But you do have to teach them who is the boss."

corgi,fbet1pw,t3_ecygw2,1576793259.0,"I don’t consider corgis that high of energy level. Maybe the three I have had are just easy. Anyway, once they are adults you can walk them about 2-4 miles a day plus a little indoor play and they won’t be destructive. They have great individual personalities. 2 of mine were barkers and one barely ever barked. They can be stubborn, so, train them well as puppies.

They also like to race around the house a couple times a day, which is so cute. For the fur problem I got a Roomba, and my problem was solved."
