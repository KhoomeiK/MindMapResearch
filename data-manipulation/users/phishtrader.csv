Freezing causes cell walls to burst and degrades the quality and texture of the meat. Some meats and fish will start falling apart after a second trip through the freezer. If you've ever used uncooked restaurant shrimp for fishing bait, you'll know what I mean. Thawing is also a risk as the more time uncooked meat spends in the temperature ""danger zone"" the more bacterial growth you'll have before freezing the meat again.

At best you'll end up with worse quality meat, at worst you could get food poisoning, but you were already risking that if you were thawing your meat in a warm-ish environment as opposed to a cold fridge.

Depending on what it is, you may be able to cook the meat, cool it, and then freeze it for future use. While, this isn't a bad tactic to use with ground beef, it doesn't work well with things like steak and not really at all with fish. Mainly I do this with meats like ground beef, pork sausage, pulled pork butt/shoulder, and smoked turkey breast. These are all meats that I tend to cook in large batches and that tend to reheat well or well enough that the convenience is worth the minimal degradation in texture."
