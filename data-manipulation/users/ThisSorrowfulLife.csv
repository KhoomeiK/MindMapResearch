TwoXChromosomes,fee9y6b,t3_eonxn5,1579029435.0,"Hairy parts on a female body are ugly, itchy, cause breakouts and bumps, catch on cotton, etc. I absolutely cannot stand it. Its sexy and beautiful and feels great in many ways to shave. I've been shaving since I was 12, I'm 27 now. Theres a reason why society and many of us are disgusted or appalled at women that dont shave."
