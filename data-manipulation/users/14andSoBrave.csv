worldnews,fdo6it0,t1_fdo2tzk,1578599749.0,"> As a direct result of trigger happy America assassinating one of their generals.

This can trace back forever and then will involve much more than just the US.

The tensions were with many across the world with Iran.  The US acting is also on the fault of Iran.  And the US wasn't the only one wanting to deal with Iran and Iran knows this.

So blaming the US is stupid and ignorant.  You can put everything on Iran 100%.

If you want proof, think if the US shot down that shit.  Would you even be sitting here saying well Iran is to blame.  No, no you would not.

So sit down and be quiet."
worldnews,fdo5ww3,t1_fdnz71q,1578599458.0,"> This is direct cause and effect.

No, no it is not.

I love how you just toss in accidentally killing civilians like it is nothing.  Mother fucker it is not something just casually toss in there.

This is not a direct cause an effect.

This is 100% Iran fucking up.

I guarantee you we would not be having this conversation if the US shot down a civilian flight.  It would be simple, 100% the US to blame.  You wouldn't be trying to say well Iran did just fire ballistic missiles so it is Iran's fault for the US simply accidentally killing a few civilians.

Iran fucked up and their actions directly by themselves lead to the death of those people.  100%.  Stop trying to spread the blame for them fucking up.  THEY FUCKED UP."

Somehow you believe Call of Duty is why anything is recognizable.

Are you fucking kidding us right now?

Next you'll tell us you only know Delta Force, navy seals, Green berets, rangers, etc all because of video games.

Kid, you're kind of showing how stupid you are.  Just stop now.

>I have literally no idea what you're talking about, so neither will 99.9% of people.

No, you seem to have no idea what you're talking about.  Many people actually do know shit outside of a video game.  Stop trying to think everyone is a fucking mentally deficient as yourself.  It's sad and pathetic, just stop.  Not all of us are children who know nothing."

Why?  Like how is that a criteria?  I bet they can google it real quick.  There, now they have the knowledge of where it is!  So now they can decide whether or not we can go to war.

That makes sense right.

I bet most % of people can't tell the difference in guns.  Why should they get to decide who can own what type?

Can't tell me where uranium is on the periodic table.  Wonder what that should preclude them from.

Can't fix their car, well can't drive now.

See I can choose random criteria from my booty butt cheeks.  Yet again, can also google a map.  I found where South Dakota was hiding, guess which state it was below?"
