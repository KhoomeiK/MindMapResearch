depression,ffiljih,t1_ffh0lt7,1579976762.0,That's true
depression,ffgef7l,t1_ffgdov8,1579904391.0,"Lol the worse part is that I've actually received that ""advice"" by psychologists/psychiatrists"
Anxiety,ffge22r,t3_ethi2o,1579904163.0,I don't think it's your fault and you shouldn't feel that way and not date because of it. Anxiety is really common and lots of people have it unfortunately. What you can do since you have experience is to help your friends with their anxiety and give advice.
TooAfraidToAsk,ffgcbqi,t3_etbv5r,1579903088.0,You're describing my sister. She's always mad. But I think it's because some people deal with sadness that way.
unpopularopinion,fff1w18,t3_etabo4,1579873432.0,"Fat shaming is not fine and if you think so you're a bully and do not actually care if people are healthy or not. It shouldn't be your concern anyway. People's bodies are different from yours, some people may even be eating better than you and exircising more than you and still be fat. It's not always because people are lazy but when it is -  just mind your own business. Bullying someone are not going to motivate them in any way, it's just gonna make people feel like shit."
Showerthoughts,fff19ay,t3_etabty,1579872913.0,You can also be a guy and not be seen as a man.
depression,fff13ee,t3_etac05,1579872775.0,"It sounds like a really bad enviroment, sorry you had to go through all that. You should do what makes you happy. Maybe you could talk to them also about how you feel if that's possible. I wish you the best."
unpopularopinion,ffdffzp,t1_ffdbq6a,1579819755.0,"But they do, at least where I live. But there's a lot we learn in school that we don't apply in our lives."
unpopularopinion,ffdajk6,t1_ffda4w1,1579816687.0,That's true but i mean what you gonna do about it? It's how things are. Sometimes I wish we had something to survive so we had to learn important things and useful things instead of just living and being useless lol.
AskReddit,ffda2km,t3_esr647,1579816398.0,"Drawing. It's not like I hate it but it seems like i don't have the patience to do it anymore and it kinda sucks because I want to get better at it but without practice that's impossible. I used to love drawing and I would spend hours and hours, sometimes an entire day doing it but now due to depression it's so hard."
unpopularopinion,ffd9oe4,t1_ffd8th4,1579816166.0,"Honestly I'm with you. I love maps and I'm 20. When I visited a big city with my sister (she's 21) someone gave me a map of the city as we arrived and I felt like a child. During that weekend I didn't drop that map from my hands, I loved the simplicity of it. Almost feels like a game. My sister on the other hand ruined my enthusiasm by checking the GPS every 5 minutes."
unpopularopinion,ffd82i8,t3_eszox7,1579815239.0,"Realism is actually very hard but when it comes to being creative... it's not creative at all, is basically copying something that already exists. So yes, I agree with you. However is still impressive when artists paint something that could be mistaken by a photo."
unpopularopinion,ffd7no5,t3_eszoz4,1579815008.0,"It's not that it made us dumb because no one is born knowing how to read a map. It's more that because we have GPS people don't need to learn how to read one. It's not really people's fault, it's just how it is nowadays due to technology."
PewdiepieSubmissions,ffd7237,t3_eszp3v,1579814681.0,Antidepressants be like
depression,ffd6w7f,t3_esz4w1,1579814590.0,"In this subreddit I've come to realise that it's hard making other people feel better when we all are basically in the same situation. But what I can tell you it's that things do get better and they also get worse, it's just how life is. But if we give up we stop being there for the good things and for the people that love us. The state of mind you have right now is being influenced by the fact that you are depressed. Yes, things are shitty and that's clear but you're feeling so bad about it because your brain can't deal with it differently. You didn't mention if you're taking any meds but I would recommend you talk to a psychiatrist to try to find the best meds for you. When I found the medication that worked for me I felt like I came back to life. That old version of me that I barely even remembered. Depression is a wound that needs to be treated. It makes you think that you're seeing things so clearly but in reality it's not. Get the help you need without being ashamed of it. You deserve to be mentally healthy and happy."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffd2k08,t3_esyzez,1579812156.0,Don't do it. Even if nothing would happen don't take that risk.
Advice,ffd2b6s,t3_esz006,1579812019.0,"I think it's better you tell them, you'll feel better and that way they can help you."
toastme,ffbfw94,t3_esoc0q,1579763501.0,You look awesome! I love when people express themselves without the fear of judgement.
depression,ffbcrl1,t1_ffaw1i1,1579759910.0,"I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried talking to a professional or taking meds? You should get help, things will get better if you do. Just don't give up on trying and you will find what's best for you."
aww,ffavse6,t3_esmeab,1579745639.0,My cat used to sleep on my neck when she was a baby. It was adorable.
depression,ffaur0f,t3_esm65k,1579744950.0,"It's okay we've all been there, you won't feel like that forever I promise"
AskWomen,ffatwhu,t3_esm0sh,1579744390.0,"I'm really frustrated by the fact that depression is still not taken seriously by people. I sometimes wish I had something physically wrong with me instead of my brain because then people wouldn't think less of me when I'm incapable of doing something. Once I had to go to the ER because my anxiety had taken over and I couldn't relax or sleep, and i couldn't stop sobbing. I stayed there for more than 40 hours without  any help. It was the worst day of my life and I really felt that no one cares about those who suffer from a mental illness. But they all seem to care when someone commits suicide because of it."
PewdiepieSubmissions,ffat2i5,t3_esln08,1579743836.0,This is so funny. You can really feel his frustration when he uses caps lock.

unpopularopinion,ffacrhu,t3_esihpj,1579732485.0,"It's not just about the portraits, it's about her life story, the pain she went through. Everything that made who she was. To appreciate art is to see what's behind the painting and what was in the artist's mind. She is far from boring."

insanepeoplefacebook,ffa9er3,t3_esix9r,1579730452.0,In Portugal almost no one has a gun and we are one of the safest countries in the world. Crime is almost dead here and school shootings aren't a thing. I don't know how you still believe being armed is the right thing.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ffa8vi7,t3_esiizk,1579730153.0,That's nothing to be ashamed of. Just use it.

unpopularopinion,ff85dxq,t1_ff84j76,1579666455.0,But isn't that normal? Of course they only accept it from SOME guys - the guys they wanna fuck. And what you described isn't even sexual harrassment. I don't see where you're going with this.
unpopularopinion,ff840fp,t3_es694x,1579665395.0,"If a guy I don't know grabs my ass out of nowhere I don't care if he looks like Brad Pitt or Donald Trump - I'm gonna give him a slap in the face. 

Why do I feel like guys think like this because they've harassed women and thought they got rejected because they're ugly? No, you got rejected because you did something innapropriate."

amiugly,ff4szwl,t1_ff4sa2o,1579571725.0,If you think this sub reddit isn't being fair do a post about what you're telling me. Maybe some people will stop down voting those kinds of comments since they are in the end what this sub reddit is about.

I deal with depression/anxiety and recently my meds haven't been doing nothing at all and they were making me feel great before. It probably has nothing to do with that but I really don't know why I feel the way i do.
amiugly,ff4otrc,t1_ff41ce0,1579568845.0,How is helping someone improve how they look a bad thing? Just saying to someone they're ugly isn't going to help them be more attractive. People come here for advice and that's a good thing. If you want to just call people ugly and not get downvoted do it in real life pal.
