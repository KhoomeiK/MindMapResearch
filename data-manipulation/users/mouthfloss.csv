quittingkratom,fezot7g,t1_feya5da,1579459791.0,I made an informed decision to try it this way
quittingkratom,fezf0gr,t1_feya5da,1579456646.0,Not necessarily. It’s worth a shot.
quittingkratom,fexh3nc,t1_few1qe1,1579430898.0,Yes I do want it. I feel like death but I don’t want to drink this shit every 2 to 3 hours anymore.

I didn’t take more methadone last night, but I took 10mg a little while ago when I woke up and I’m hoping and praying that it’s gonna kick in at that dose because if not, there’s absolutely no way I can work like this."
