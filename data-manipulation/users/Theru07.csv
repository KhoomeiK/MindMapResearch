SuicideWatch,fed0sis,t3_eo9o49,1578992955.0,"Hello OP! Did you know that there is a new season of Puella Magi and the first two episodes are already online? They also make a sequel to the last Madoka movie! Those are some things that keep me alive- because I'd miss them if I'd kill myself now. 
I know how it feels but try to imagine better times. I'm 22 now and managed to go to Japan last year. There will be better days even if you can't see them now. I promise! If you want to talk, you can always message me."
pokemon,fdnatmw,t3_emae7c,1578581755.0,I cried while watching the direct because of this. I love those games and I still play them and I'm so excited for the remake!
