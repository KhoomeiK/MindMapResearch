medical,ffuzh3q,t1_ffuzbgj,1580252314.0,So many blood tests lol.  Iron levels all okay.  Was given tablets though just to see if there would be improvement. Thanks.
medical,ffuzaag,t1_ffuyyhb,1580252212.0,Haven't had any tests done aside from the typical heart monitor.  Been through a load of physicals though with no issues.
medical,ffuyd1s,t1_ffuxoj6,1580251696.0,"I was on Lexapro for a little over a year and a half so I know it takes time. I'll give a different anxiety med a try. Thank you so much. Being pointed in a direction, any direction, is comforting for the time being."
AskDocs,ffur508,t1_ffg96o6,1580247752.0,"I just posted seeking help for this same issue. My providers have also kinda been shitty, but I don't blame them if it isn't a common thing.  Were you successful in finding out?

Hope you weren't told to ""just take deep breaths, maybe get a massage and relax"" like me..."
gaming,fflb1rn,t3_eu4hcn,1580037360.0,I'll be honest this looks like somebody ran a screenshot through an oil painting filter on their phone and then posted it saying they painted it...
AirForce,fff7ahv,t1_fff4l8l,1579877515.0,"How long did it take for that word to be no longer acceptable in public?  How long does it have to take to stop calling people gay or associating it negatively?

How about a sticker that says: ""I'll let anyone drive my car, just not my wife, she's Asian!"". Would that be acceptable as a meme on this sub?"
AirForce,fff3nxy,t1_fff259r,1579874840.0,"My black friend uses the n word as a good natured gesture of friendship. So should I be allowed to say it on a sub that is the de facto face of the Air Force for Reddit?

Public perception."
AirForce,fff3jty,t1_fff2rkn,1579874754.0,"Actually too busy working to be on Reddit during work. You missed the point this isn't a ""don't associate gay negatively on Reddit"" this is ""we shouldn't be associating gay negatively on the Air Force sub"""
AirForce,ffepycw,t1_ffeog79,1579859630.0,Then that's a huge fail on you and your leadership.
AirForce,ffeo8mi,t1_ffencg5,1579857024.0,"I mean this is an Air Force sub. Wouldn't use gay disparagingly at work, why do it here?"
AirForce,ffeg9px,t3_et4dac,1579846846.0,Gotta stop using gay as a negative connotation thing. It's 2020 my dude.

starterpacks,fem794v,t3_eprqrp,1579242271.0,"Dungeons & Dragons is devil worship?

Pokémon teaches evolution?

Heavy metal is the music of Satan?

Can't celebrate Halloween - hands out Chick Tracts or goes to a ""Harvest Festival"" instead

This meme was my childhood."
Xcom,fel8na6,t3_epncv6,1579216448.0,I don't understand how I end up with English names for Turkey. Wish I could mod but I have it for PS4
AirForce,fejwxfh,t3_epi3o7,1579187732.0,What NCO essentials do you feel you aren't getting?
AirForce,fejvz4q,t1_fejtex3,1579187115.0,"We taught those things and this is what we got as feedback from the field: ""you don't teach it right, they can't use that abbreviation, that's not the local policy, that's not current, that's irrelevant, etc."" People are going to complain about the institution regardless, just as with Basic, Tech School, et al. Realistically ALS is not and never will be anything more than a basic foundation. Airmen spend 5 weeks at ALS. They spend many months if not years with their home units. The burden of development largely falls on you, not us.

Edit: You are still right though, which is why most schoolhouses I know of incorporate bullet writing, ACA, and all the other NCO admin stuff in their Reflective flex time."
AirForce,fehxwcu,t3_ep1mb5,1579126066.0,"Better idea: get rid of TVs (and ""training monitors"") and stop fucking buying them.  The work centers that have a legitimate need for them can probably be counted on one hand."
pics,fehu3q5,t1_fehiih8,1579123896.0,So I read this as Anne Frank for some reason...
JustBootThings,fehsb5k,t1_fehi1x2,1579122886.0,"Well I hope that outlook didn't inflate your head. I've known more than enough 90+ scoring window lickers, and absolutely brilliant minimum scorers.  I think most people who have served will agree the military contains some of the smartest people they knew, and also some of the dumbest."
