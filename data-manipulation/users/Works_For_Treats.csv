Ask the instructor if you can attend other classes on the sidelines and use the class as one big distraction. Find your dog's working distance(threshold) and work on getting that shorter. The behaviors that your dog is being allowed to do have to be stopped completely because they are inherently reinforcing, both by when she actually gets to do them, and subsequently the behavior chain when you're 'distracting' her with obedience things.

It really depends on the training session. If you're still wanting to drive build and the session is going to give him a bite quickly to get him into the game, then a harness and letting him drag in should be fine. 

But if you're not planning on letting him bite quick or the decoy has other things in mind, then you might insist on trying to get his head more in obedience. 

What you choose is entirely up to you and your particular dog. I don't have him in front of me so it's very difficult to advise accurately. 

>Itd be nice if he walked next to me, but does this inhibit his motivation and excitement?

Putting pressure on him will damage motivation. Gatekeeping will not, it'll actually build drive through frustration. How supportive your particular club is with the latter is another story. I'd really suggest you go check out [Denise Fenzi's website](https://www.fenzidogsportsacademy.com/).

Most(if not all) of these are yearly things. There's more that I probably forgot. 

Pretty much this can all be fixed with networking. Stick your neck out there. Going to a club is great, facebook is also a good tool at times. Finding people with mals is going to show you what a mal is like. There is variation between the breed, just like any other, so when you are ready to get one do you research. There's also great **mal rescues**, so you could adopt one that isn't quite up to snuff as a starter mal. Most of these mals are from pet dog homes that discovered they actually didn't want a mal. Some are from training elsewhere that washed out. That should give you an idea of whether you would be a good fit or not. A rescue mal will most likely be a toned down version of a well bred working mal. There's nothing wrong with them and I would consider it if I were you. 

Training methods between breeds are pretty different. You CANNOT train a mal the same way that you can a GSD. Mals are very sensitive and take finesse. With GSDs you can get away with yank and crank methods.

Hiking, sniffy walks, aimless jaunts on a long line where you're just following the dog. Treat/puzzle feeders. Take the pressure off. Focus on theory yourself, so learning, gaining new habits to get you to your goals, networking. Carve out time from the busyness of your day to be selfish with it. 

> I was worried he'd actually lose touch, kind of like how humans do when they don't practice sports/musical instruments.

This can happen with dogs that are not married to the training. Dogs that aren't so keen or their behaviors have always been shaky or unclear. I would expect perhaps a loss in precision, but it's nothing that can't come back with a little work. Behavioral training is another matter entirely, but obedience stuff is usually fairly solid. 

>You seem extremely experienced haha. When did you start? How long did it take you to get where you are?

I have a horse training background originally and grew up with dogs and horses on a ranch. My dad was somewhat of a horse trainer and so there was always knowledge in the house about the topic. So I kind of got a head start as far as dog/horse body language goes which has given me less to worry about learning-wise. Of course that's still getting fine tuned, but I think novice trainers can really become overwhelmed with information. Anyways I digress. Formally it's only been 2 years roughly since my immersion program. Right after that I started studying for my cpdt-ka, got it, and have read/studied/trained so much since then. Dog training is one of my passions and I am a bit of a nerd for it, so I can knowledge sponge away. If that's how you are too, take advantage of your downtime with study. Videos can be helpful but the best resources on that front will be paid ones. The problem is that it takes a lot of time to digest or actually watch, so personally it's not the best way to get info in for me. 

I strongly suggest that you identify your dog goals and any holes that may prevent you from success, *especially financial ones*. Good knowledge isn't free, so whether that's books, videos, courses, or in person classes, it does add up. Those big expos and things, they are worth it. [Clicker expo](https://clickerexpo.clickertraining.com/clicker-expo-usa/), [working dog convention](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/research/centers-initiatives/penn-vet-working-dog-center/learn-about-working-dogs/working-dog-conference), [Canine Science Symposium](https://www.caninesciencesymposium.com/), [things from The Ranch](https://theranch.clickertraining.com/courses-seminars/training-for-professionals/), [Iaabc](https://iaabcconference.org/), [Fenzi camp](https://fdsatrainingcamp.com/about/), [APDT conference](https://apdt.com/apdt-conference-temp/), etc. And that's not even mentioning seminars or workshops that will be happening locally. My point is to figure out how serious you are about training. Is this a one dog thing? Are you looking to become a trainer for other people as well? Is it just a hobby? As soon as you've got those answers for yourself you can then shift things into place to make those goals happen.

k9sports,ff5edeg,t1_ff5adro,1579589301.0,">How much time would you say is a good amount to train?

It sounds that you're doing things well. I would schedule days without training(which you seem to do), like just a hike, sniffy walks. Let the dog decompress and be a dog. Doesn't have to be 2 consecutive days, but I would take 2 off. Periodically, like every 6 months or so, take weeks off. The dogs come back to training like their tails are on fire. Taking breaks that are structured are not detrimental. Michael advocates for this as well.

Session length depends. Definitely work past what competition length would be **when you are getting ready to compete seriously**, but working on any one skill should be short sessions 3-5 minutes, broken up by play and rest. **END THE SESSION WHEN IT FEELS BEST** When you feel like everything is going great, when it feels good, end the damn thing. Let the dog rest. Start again 15-20 minutes later. A novice mistake that we all make is not stopping and then the wheels fall off the bus and it all goes to shit. Not that this is the worst thing in the world, but it's not good for your confidence, potentially can be damaging to the dog's confidence, and sour moods make sour training. 

>Also there's a ton of sports out there. I haven't done much research, but intuition tells me they're all similar, but different at the same time. 

Yes. Motivation is a key factor in all dog sports. If you know how to hijack this, you're golden with anything you could ever want to try. 

>Does it matter which one to start with? 

No. Many dogs do more than one sport, and in dog training I think that's actually the norm once you know what you're doing. Training only tightens up your training chops so the more of it that you do, the better you get. The more you know the more you can adapt for the situation depending on what dog you have in front of you. Choice based training, whether with aversives or without, is king. That much is very clear.

This is one of the reasons why I've branched out as much as I have. I'm on a quest with my dogs(and client dogs) to find the best information from the best people in the industry and see what training methods pan out. So far for sport: Michael's methods are great and they do work. I find that they are generally fair to the dog. Currently I'm also a student of Susan Garrett, who is a world renown agility trainer. Every dog she's owned has made it to world if I'm not mistaken. Her methods are about as force free as one can get and it's all about gatekeeping reward as well as careful and precise layering of the training. Science completely backs the fact that dogs(and humans) learn best through fun, which is another aspect of the training. Her methods and Michael's have many many similarities even though they don't overlap much. One of the biggest keys is the drive and motivation building. You have nothing with an unmotivated dog. 

So far I have discovered that 99% of pet dogs don't need aversive tools in their lives. Which is great because most pet dog owners can hardly operate clickers correctly, let alone a prong. I suspect that there are also plenty of sport dogs that could do better with restructuring of the aversives used. I am not yet convinced that they have no place in training for sport. But it is fact that aversives can squash a dog very easily and the difference between a squashed dog and one that is phenomenal comes down to the slightest difference in timing. Plus some genetics.

I have also discovered that it is much better to have a dog that has been lured and shaped and is familiar with both methods of training. Shaping exercises make all training go faster because they create a thinking dog. So those leaps in understanding happen quicker. Not to say that luring doesn't work or is not good, but I don't think that it alone is ideal.   

>I've heard some good things about ring sports too, but the info on local clubs on the internet is minimal. Not sure why that is, how would people find out about clubs? 

Building a site is generally hard for normal people, there's upkeep and maintenance as well. Paying money for a good decoy is generally where the fees for bitesport clubs go. Frankly I think that it should be harder to find than just out there. Weeds a lot of people out that you wouldn't necessarily want in the club. Yes it could be better, but it works how it is. This is another major benefit of starting to rub shoulders with dog trainers. Those connections are what will get you more info on these things and into places that the general public can't even find. Facebook pages might help, as well as groups. Frankly it's kinda a ""If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask,"" situation in dog training. Keep an open mind! You can learn something from everyone, even if it's just ""I'm not going to use those methods"" or ""I think this is bullshit"".

Protection work of course will be mainly driven by the helper, but I don't see why they wouldn't let you work some obedience using the helper as a distraction. The value build for the helper doesn't have to be all in one shot and will only get stronger as your dog grows to love the activity. 

The issue with letting the standard be, my dog gets to be a nutjob around the decoy, is that now that's the monster you have to fight. Everything in dog training is a value game, and decoy work is the absolute top tier reward that can occur for many dogs. The monster this makes is proportional.

So the choices you have to deal with getting obedience around the decoy is to use punishment for mistakes, gatekeep the reward and reward the behavior you want, or some combo of the two. I firmly believe in fairness for the dog, which means making sure the layers/foundation of training are as strong as we can make them before adding variables. The rule of thumb is 80%+ success in a behavior before adding a single new variable and raising expectations of the dog.

>not sure how welcomed this will be 

Ask. Ask everyone everything. Show interest, show investment. These people all have similar goals and passions, get them talking about it. You'll get word vomit if you hit the right topic. Be persistent. Get contact info for these people too.

The reason that there may be some stand offish behavior is because these types of sports attract unscrupulous and unsuitable people that bring their garbage dog in and get butthurt when they can't make the cut, when they trash the skills of others, or when they realize that bitework is actually something completely different than having a ""mean"" dog.  There's also a lot of flakes which waste the whole club's time and resources. There's other similar reasons as well. If you're dedicated to the sport, willing to learn, not a flake, and generally decent, you'll be fine with a little persistence."

k9sports,ff2ekhb,t1_ff2b90f,1579502896.0,"So the problem is that your dog is taught to say a middle school/low high school level, and you're expecting a college level. It's just holes in training and your dog telling you exactly where you are. I would not correct for the dog not engaging because that not only removes the dog's choice, but it doesn't actually teach anything in that moment. The dog isn't punished into suddenly being engaged, they're simply suppressed a little and may appear more engaged. HUGE difference between the two. It's a correction for correction's sake. 

It's more appropriate to use an interrupter and just work on a shortening that threshold distance that your dog will work with a decoy in the picture. I would separate the sessions if possible. So you work a turn where you're merely using the decoy as a distraction, and others where you are working specifically on targeting, pressure, etc. Then you slowly combine the two. Right now if you're losing focus on you it's just your dog saying that the distraction is too high. It's like if you take a child to Disneyland and then tell them they've got to sit down and do their math homework. Smacking the kid won't help. Building focus with distractions will. Helper can do a number of things to help with this, face a wall, be in a corner, even working with some bite equipment on the floor may help your dog. 

So an example would be that you run a heeling pattern that your dog should be able to do, play with the distance to the decoy, and then maybe your dog gets an easy bite, for the heeling. Then you'd go back to heeling where you found success, or even farther away if possible. If that's too hard for your dog work on even easier exercises. Work on play, but end the play session with some bites. This is how I would structure it. Taking advantage of Premack principle and minimizing corrections in areas where they aren't beneficial. 

Punishment isn't really constructive for engagement specifically for other reasons as well. For example there's plenty of dogs that just get more hyped when they get corrections. Obviously I've never met your dog, so that's something that only you'd know. Frustration problems, instilling too much nerviness; being around the decoy should mean ""there's potential for great reward"". Punishments are effective when the dog makes a mistake for something we know they know, an obedience maneuver potentially, but for attention/engagement if you've never worked with that high level of distraction it's just not fair to the dog. Gatekeeping is much better overall because it's the dog's responsibility from the start. Don't be afraid to end a session without getting a bite. That's the dog's responsibility to behave in a way to earn one. A little bit of scarcity won't hurt him and will help reinforce good reps instead of C.R.A.P.(continually reinforced ambiguous performance).

>I honestly didn't even think he would be this excited to do bite work.

Genetics. :)

Which club are you going to if you don't mind me asking?

Take all of these with a grain of salt. Many authors nowadays are reward based, and distraction work using only rewards makes for clever solutions, and in my experience there is greater understanding in the dog. Not to say that punishment can't or doesn't work, I think it has its place in training as well. My experience with my dogs and my client dogs has been that there's much greater end synergy and the behaviors don't need as much upkeep. No tools to fade out later either. But I digress. 

Some books off the top of my head:

Control Unleashed - Leslie McDevitt, It's more for the concepts than the exercises imo. 
Culture Clash
Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training, Vol. 1: Adaptation and Learning
Any of Patricia McConnell's books

It's also worth heading over to Denise Fenzi's site and looking through the courses she offers. They're usually around $30 of so and you can pick whatever you'd like or think fits your particular needs. Pretty great stuff for obedience training. Blending techniques doesn't usually cause conflicts and it's best to have as many tools as possible. I'm not sure if there is anything specifically for bitesports, but I do know that Denise has competed in the sports herself, so her methodologies can be applied there too."

>Feels kind of discouraging.

Yes because your expectations are farther down the path than your training is. Your dog is doing the best they can with the education they've been given. ALWAYS keep that in mind. 

The distractions that you've been using are great distractions, however it should be noted that those distractions are not the same as the distractions that you'll be facing elsewhere. So you've prepped your dog well for the distractions that are readily available to you, but there are holes in the training with distractions that are harder for you to come by. Which is normal and to be expected, nothing to be discouraged about. 

If you run into that issue again just use Premack principle and use engagement with you as a requirement for your dog to do well at before allowing them to work with the decoy. You want your dog to unlock the opportunity to do what they really enjoy most, by working with you.

It's enough to wait a minute or two. When exactly you want your dog to be engaged with you is up to you. Personally I get my dogs out of the car, usually take a second to close a crate or grab a toy/prop, and then off we go. So my dogs have just enough time to look at the area sniff the air, before we're off to the races. I ask for engagement before they even get a to whatever area for a potty break. I expect engagement right out of the gate and will put a dog back if they can't demonstrate that before we start.

>Just not too sure where to go.

Figure this out. 

>stop the training kennel him

Yes. Otherwise the dog is practicing not listening or being engaged. The dog checks out, I quit training and remove them from the environment. I assess why this is happening, did I miss a layer of distraction training, am I being lazy, is the challenge too hard, etc. But you wouldn't isolate the dog completely. You're merely looking to create that contrast between working with you(not boring) and being crated(boring).

>What if it's simple engagement exercises (look&reward, hand targeting) and then moving onto routines like heeling?

Eh, you have to gauge your dog. With simple things like this you should be getting 100% performance. This is your barometer for where the arousal state is on your dog. You warm them up to the point where they're stoked to work. Then transfer that into the next behaviors you want to practice.  

>I'll usually let him sit and get used to the environment

No. You're rehearsing the dog needing to get used to the environment and them actively choosing the environment over you until they happen to get bored. What they should be doing is learning to actually work through the distraction and work despite the distraction. This also may be cultivating habits in you that are less than stellar. 

Build up their drive. Play food games, without any other requirements than being engaged in the game. An adult dog should be able to be engaged with you right out of the car/kennel.

>ONLY doing positive treat training

Don't knock these trainers. Some of the top trainers that have ever existed are positive only. It's also spread across all sports. In my experience there is fairly heavy bias against reward based purely positive trainers because of a number of factors, and none of it speaks well for either side. This is coming from someone with a balanced background. The most important thing is that the methodology must be cohesive. If you put the dog under stress, you have to teach them how to deal with it. If you're using reward based training only, then there has to be a serious transfer of value and utterly clever tactics when building your dog up. I'm not going to bash training that involves aversives either, but I will say that current science doesn't necessarily support the claim that slight corrections have zero effect on your dog. I personally believe that LIMA is a great methodology to apply to training of any dog, keeping in mind that clarity and confidence in and for the dog lessen the need for aversives or Ooops scenarios.

Michael and Forrest have similar philosophies and are fantastic trainers both. Robert Cabral I don't have much experience with but there is old school weirdness that puts me off (there's little reason to keep food in your mouth for example). Larry Krohn also has some old school weirdness(like issues about dogs sleeping in beds with you) which doesn't all translate into good science based training. There is an e-collar conditioning process that I don't hear Larry talk about at all, and that always raises massive red flags because the tool isn't effective if you right away make the dog collar wise. I also get the feeling about the latter two that perhaps they're not so up to speed on still evolving methods in the dog training world, which is part of the job of being a trainer, but that's another story entirely."

Those that say the military is the best and they only had the greatest time are usually morons or they have very little life experience overall. This is speaking as former enlisted(female), I can't speak for the experience of those who were officers. 

The best part is the camaraderie. Not many jobs in life offer that same thing. I've found similar camaraderie in parts of the dog sport world, but I digress. This was the only good thing that I experienced in the military. 

The rest is garbage. On my base suicide rate was high. Every few months we'd hear about someone killing themselves because of stress. We were told that we could go to medical if we were sick or had ""the sads"" at the cost of falling behind in our training and most likely getting booted from out training pipeline. Guess how many people went to seek help?

On top of that the help that you could get(in my experience) was not good. Before I got out, I went to talk to someone about things I was struggling with and essentially was told that the things I said couldn't be that bad, and was not believed by the mental health professional. One of my shipmates had tried to get the guards at the gate to shoot him because he couldn't handle the pressure, which started a cascade of events with his roommates(also shipmates of mine) where they all ""sadded out"". 

In the simplest terms that's having some mental struggle too great to overcome during the training pipeline and subsequently getting booted. The attitude that our particular rate had towards these people was not pity, but callousness, apathy, and disgust. They were viewed as pathetic and weak individuals who deserved what was coming to them. Of course you'd never hear an instructor say that out loud but there was always an undercurrent of this present. There were jokes about death, suicide, etc, made about the people who didn't cut it. Being a woman I naturally was only one step above these people and was treated unprofessionally by some of my seniors daily. 

It was the most toxic environment I have ever experienced and I spent years after getting out dealing with the baggage that being there left me with. The trouble is that in that particular rate group it's sort of separate from the rest of the Navy. Those who have never been in it simply don't believe and have difficulty understanding the culture that we went through there. It was dehumanizing at times, and for some, utterly demoralizing until they killed themselves. And the military spends these lives left and right. Without a care. Victims are demonized, vilified and blamed.

k9sports,fepiw1j,t1_fepgvs0,1579321654.0,">I usually up the difficulty as the training goes on

In one session, no I would not do this. Think of it like a lesson in school or a job at work. How disheartening is it to be at the foot of a task that you already find somewhat difficult, and know that it's only going to get harder as you go on?

Certainly we do challenge the dog and we're always testing understanding, but it should always be in a way that protects the dog's confidence and builds them up. 

My training sessions start with a warm up to get the dog's head into it, which depends on which dog I'm using. My mal is very hair trigger, and it takes almost no effort to get her in peak working arousal. My GSD doesn't have the same work ethic, but she is a workhorse that won't quit. With both I do a short tug session or some other game to get that interest at its peak. Then the training begins. 

I always will do some reps that I think the dog knows, then I move to the skill I want to focus on. I have notes of what I plan to do that day ahead of time, so that's all taken care of. Then all that's left is evaluating the work as we go and the actual training. The training is challenging, and I do push my dogs for successes and for those ""breakthrough"" moments. We also take [balance breaks](https://susangarrettdogagility.com/2019/01/the-secret-sauce-for-enthusiasm-balance-breaks/) throughout the sessions, which helps break things up and facilitates learning for the dogs. Paradoxically it can also help build up that impulse control, and help maintains low stress. Used in a clever manner it's very powerful. At the end I send whoever was training off to their mat jot some notes, and then call the next dog for their turn. And we go back and forth like that. 

I think mindset is also very important as well. Good training sessions where your dog makes no mistakes are of course good, but you aren't getting much constructive feedback of your skills in those sessions. Failures and mistakes highlight what's going wrong or where your weak areas are, which is always a plus since that allows us to strive to be better. Titles and competing are great and all, but they're not worth that much if your training isn't evolving and improving.

In the litter they will fight over scraps(like tug) and subsequently carry their prize(like fetch). I do not see the pup choosing to bring back the object, I see a pup that happens to do so. The ball goes out > pup gets it/fools around > saunters back to human because the environment is boring and the human is more interesting than the room. On top of this, the way the pup moves suggests to me that their goal is to get behind the human, which makes much more sense than they want to fetch. Open spaces can make pups nervous, and to me that's more likely. 

The unfortunate part is that the video is cut right before the pup gets to the human, so we don't get to see how the behavior plays out completely. We also don't get to see the other pups.

k9sports,fem931a,t1_fem6a9i,1579244281.0,"It may be clarity issues then. It's really hard to say. 

Impulse control games are really easy. It's pretty much just releasing the dog to access reward, to start. The key is that they wait how you want them to, and that you're *able to control the reward*. If they break their control and are able to access the reward then you can backslide quickly. Then it's a matter of building up that control and transferring it to other areas in the training. 

>I was thinking of mixing play and food rewards but I'm not sure how that will turn out. Thoughts?

It shouldn't be dog breaking if that's what you're worried about. If your dog likes food more, great, food is a good distraction when asking them to play with you and visa versa. Treating each as a distraction *when done using force free methods* will not harm the value of either type of reward. With impulse control things it's important to keep the training positive and choice based for the dog to let them think through it rather than rely on correction. The latter can tend to produce a dog that only displays self control in certain scenarios. 

As far as being unpredictable with rewards goes, this also depends where you are in the training. It could be that you could cut out the jackpotting but throughout the session when you reward you give 2-3 rewards in a row, so that there's more than one reward event per maneuver at times. On the other hand you may be at the stage where you should be rewarding more selectively, such as reps of things that are quiet. Last comes in true intermittent reinforcement when you're maintaining things. 

Another point is training session length for things your dog leaks with. 3-5 minutes. 10 minute break/rest(at least). 3-5 minutes more. So that you can catch as many quiet reps as possible. 

Rewarding every rep can cause inadvertent frustration if you miss a reward, or if your dog thinks they should have gotten a reward already. It's really dog dependent and hard to diagnose online. These are all things that I'd try to play around with and log. There is a key in there somewhere, the trick is just to find it so that you can adapt. Log the sessions thoroughly!!!!"

At 12 months he is fully capable of not having accidents in the house, so if you're seeing him have them if you miss the bells, he's not really potty trained. 

What has happened(and what often happens with potty bells) is that your dog has learned that every time he wants to be let out, he just has to ring the bell for you. He thinks he has trained you. 

Times to go out into the yard should be longer so that he can get all of his business taken care of. Weather permitting, you shouldn't be letting him in until he's done and you know he doesn't have to go. Same with going outside. If he just went 20 minutes ago and has nothing else in there, the only reason he's summoning you is for entertainment. Which brings me to the next topic.

These types of things can stem from boredom. Make sure your dog is able to keep himself amused without bothering you, or that you're interacting enough with him to keep his need sated."

Dogtraining,feidbq0,t3_ep80ye,1579135847.0,"The dog should wear a leash around the house. This is so that you always have a way to lead him off the furniture without any sort of drama or conflict. 

Also the behaviors you find unacceptable are actually very normal. Dogs can startle awake. Try to wake him up with his name or other noise when you're a distance away. Then when he's awake, move towards him. Give him a second to get his bearings. Use the leash to move him without adding tension or conflict."
