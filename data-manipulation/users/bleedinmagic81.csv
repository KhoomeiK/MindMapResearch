Pink Floyd are my favorite group of all time (only bringing them up because of the Dark Side of the Moon cover on the wall), but their status as my favorite doesn't diminish the value of modern groups. The squiggly stuff on the kid's shirt leads me to believe that he's into death metal/black metal/the like, and those sub-genres are mostly definitely not for me, but that doesn't mean they're yucky. A+ comic"

From the first time I walked in there, the folks were nice, but now I'm a ""regular,"" they know my name (they give you a number for your table, but since everyone there knows me, they never give me one), and whenever I decide to order a different drink, they'll go, ""Aw, no mint chocolate milkshake?"" They brighten my day every time"
