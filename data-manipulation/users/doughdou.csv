AmItheAsshole,fefex6y,t3_eok9zk,1579054875.0,YTA I have eczema and I also get it very easily on my hands. Using gloves to go to the bathroom is not a dermatologist recommended way to prevent flare ups and it’s very unsanitary to use the same gloves over and over again anyways. Go to a dermatologist and get prescribed some ointment and also ask for advice on how to care for your skin. You’ll never need the gloves again.

I was initially going to vote NTA but the things you said to your sister were totally uncalled for. You have a right to be upset about the marriage but you crossed a line by slut shaming your sister."
