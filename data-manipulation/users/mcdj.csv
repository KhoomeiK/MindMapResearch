From the NYT:


WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID
“*By the way, in terms of the money, it got there two or three weeks ahead of schedule, long before it was supposed to be there.*”

False. President Trump was wrong in asserting that his decision last year to suspend military assistance to Ukraine — a key component in his impeachment and upcoming trial — did not interfere with the schedule for delivering the aid.

The 2019 federal fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, the date by which all appropriated aid to Ukraine was supposed to be disbursed. But because of the freeze ordered by Mr. Trump, not all of the aid was spent before the deadline.

Congress had appropriated $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine — $250 million from the Pentagon and $141 million from the State Department — meant to be spent by the end of September. Though the Pentagon announced its plans to provide the aid in June, White House officials blocked its release in July. It remained frozen until mid-September, when Mr. Trump relented after pressure from lawmakers and administration officials.

With just two weeks left in the fiscal year, the Pentagon was unable to fully disburse the funds. According to testimony from Mark Sandy, an official in the Office of Management and Budget, about $35 million was left unspent. Congress then extended the deadline to the 2020 fiscal year to allow for the disbursement of the remaining aid.

“Had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of Sept. 30 would have expired,” Mr. Sandy said."
politics,ffe1t21,t1_ffe0w4x,1579834481.0,"Trump was pretending that he was talking about a legitimate investigation on the White House lawn.
