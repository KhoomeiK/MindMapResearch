I saw the wreckage when I flew in the next day and it looked pretty bad. That's a heavy ass bird coming down regardless."
todayilearned,ffqh68x,t1_ffpqjfe,1580134474.0,"My unit had a Chinook crash in Afghanistan. It went to land at the fob and the engines cut off, dropping around 100 feet and smashing into the ground. Thankfully no one was seriously injured, and that I was on the 2nd chalk. I rode in a Blackhawk the next day instead, but I was terrified."

You can actually sneak around in the woods and keep your head down in a ditch without fear of someone taking you out from across the map."

Edit: you all are welcome to explain why this is unreasonable. The way IR works in game is far from realistic. And in a map as large as Shoreline I shouldn't get picked off as soon as I spawn."

worldnews,fefl5h1,t1_feeeyxj,1579058656.0,"I took a gender studies class in college.

AskReddit,feejhaa,t1_fed7ohl,1579035000.0,"In a screenwriting class I took we had to do a table read for our final projects(a 19 page short film). I anticipated some controversy because the plot was somewhat provacative. The lead character was male, but most of the side characters were women.

We would have discussions after each table read, and when we finished mine the professor says ""before we start, I want to ask the women in the class how they feel about the female representation."" Which lead to an hour long discussion (significantly longer than any other person's script) about my plot and character choices. Basically making me appear sexist because I wrote a fictional story about not so great people doing not so great acts. 

This professor also integrated his political opinions into his lectures and course content, and always started class talking about politics. It shouldn't be allowed."
unpopularopinion,fed3axg,t1_fed2hl7,1578996670.0,You're right. You don't have to be right wing or religious to be repulsed by dirty genitals. Not like anyone wears condoms anymore with all these young girls parents getting them on birth control at 16.

So I did.

Tried it for a couple weeks before everyone was telling me to grow it back again.

It was great when I was younger and I had options when I got a haircut. I wish I could do certain styles and change things up every few months. But instead I'm stuck with short, tapered sides with everything thats left on top kind of styled and spiked. So I guess I'll do that until there's nothing left.
