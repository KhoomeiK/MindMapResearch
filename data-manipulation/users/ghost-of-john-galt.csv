Now, neither of these are racist. The latter implies a prejudice that you believe Mexicans make superior enchiladas. Also, not so much a negative statement. It does not put this Mexican lady down in any way.

If you said, ""I'm glad she made enchiladas instead of pad thai,"" that would be prejudice with negative connotations.

If you said, ""the only thing that Mexican lady is good for is making enchiladas,"" that would be a racist statement. You're implying this person has no worth except for making enchiladas.

People mostly confuse the two words racism and prejudice. Prejudice is a front loaded judgement you have of somebody. Racism is the belief that a person of a race (even your own) is less capable, inferior.

I hope this helps. Most people aren't racists, and those who are definitely know it. It's healthy to have prejudice, but it can get out of hand.

You will go there for misdemeanors, or for any arrest prior to conviction of a crime. This can be different for those on parole, because in some states an inmate released to parole is still technically an inmate, and will be detained in prison during their parole hearing. A judge can remand you to the custody of the jail for a felony. A prison is governed by the state or federal government, and the judge can release you to the custody of the state if convicted of a felony. If you're convicted of a federal crime, in federal court, you will be sentenced to a federal prison, unless by special circumstances the federal government chooses to house the prisoner in a different prison or jail.
