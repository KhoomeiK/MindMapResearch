MakeupLounge,ffh1rnm,t3_eszg1m,1579920791.0,"I have this problem and same skin type. I have found that I also rest my chin on my hands a lot and touch that area. I’m just more mindful to not do that. I have also found that using MAC Fix+ after I foundation and powder really does help melt the powder in together. Followed by a setting spray. 

I use a blurring primer in my T-zone and a gripping or hydrating primer on the rest of my face. There is a YouTuber named Olena Something and her foundation routine is what works to have my makeup last from 4:30AM (I work at 5:00AM) until 8PM at night. [here’s the video](https://youtu.be/51A4Ez0C8-0)"
MUAontheCheap,ffgcog1,t1_fffyoud,1579903305.0,Damn! Good for you. With point multipliers and being strategic I can see that happening. I am an Ulta fan now after I was able to use a 20% coupon off a Dyson Airwrap AND had a 5X multiplier and got over $125 back in rewards on it this past December. My only regret was getting my Dyson blowdryer during the spring 2019 VIB sale at Sephora and not shopping at Ulta earlier. I don’t care about hitting Rouge anymore. I’m waiting for the 7X and 10X days that happen once a year at Ulta.
MUAontheCheap,fffu90a,t1_ffft5oj,1579891916.0,Ulta is the way to go! I hope they continue to get more brands this year.
MUAontheCheap,fffqfe0,t3_etd7i2,1579889556.0,"For comparison, 500 points at Ulta = $17.50."
muacjdiscussion,fffhqej,t1_fff3m0e,1579884219.0,"Don’t be discouraged. I used to have the same issues, but once you get comfortable with applying makeup for your facial features you will become quicker and more efficient. I have my days where I take my time, or if I’m trying something new that requires a lot more time and perfection."
muacjdiscussion,fffhdf1,t1_fferfji,1579883992.0,"I’m so sorry. Being a mother myself, this really makes me sad. Hugs."
Makeup,fffgt5g,t3_et5isu,1579883644.0,"I prefer the Pro one (black color). The texture is different from the others, but it works really well and cleans the best. I have cut open my old sponges to validate this claim. 

I use the Fairy dish soap method for cleaning my Beauty Blender. Fairy dish soap in a bowl with hot water and sponge in the microwave for 60 seconds. Add another minute if stains are stubborn and voila, clean sponge."
BeautyGuruChatter,fffgei1,t3_etcca8,1579883389.0,"If I’m going to get a nine pan mini like this, it’s going to be from Huda or Colourpop."
BeautyGuruChatter,ffffz7s,t1_fffepfn,1579883129.0,"New Yawker and OG in ABH Amrezy palette is also the same, but I’m okay with that one because it’s a transition she’s which gets used more often. It’s annoying as hell when it’s not like the Carli palette."
Sephora,fffe9hn,t3_etcb0i,1579882054.0,"Yes, but just make sure you really want it, because any purchase with a Rouge Reward is final sale. You can only exchange it for the exact same item, but you cannot return or exchange it for another color."
PanPorn,fff8l6e,t3_etb8q4,1579878412.0,I’m an NC37 and this is one of my HG blush.
Sephora,ffeu7vk,t3_et5kew,1579865740.0,"Super awesome gratis! I have the purple Foreo luna 3 too. I love it! I hope you enjoy it. 

I got a sample of the MILK moisturizer and will be getting the full size once I’m almost done with my Ole Henriksen one.

Enjoy!"
MakeupAddiction,ffenx8q,t3_de8h07,1579856553.0,"I just ordered the Zoeva eye brush set and own Sonia G and Wayne Goss brushes. I don’t own any Chikuhodo or Hakuhodo brushes since I’m relatively new to fude brushes. 

I’ll keep you posted... I’m in the U.S. so I’m not sure how long the products will take to get delivered."
PanPorn,ffcttua,t3_esw6a6,1579807130.0,"I like this way more than the DE Babyfacial. I was so happy when I was finished with my last bottle and could continue to just use this. I used the DE Babyfacial for 20mins, but with this I can only use it for 10mins and then I take a shower and wash it off. I use this on my face and neck."
Costco,ffctaqq,t3_esxhup,1579806821.0,"All the top 8 allergy friendly stuff they have. Our toddler has this condition called eosinophilic esophagitis and his triggers are the top 8 allergens and beef. For simplicity sake, we all eat his diet and have found so many things at Costco that are allergen friendly! 

But you asked for top 3, so here it is:
- namaste flour 
- frozen uncooked chicken wings (great in an air fryer)
- produce: broccoli florets, green beans, baby bella mushrooms"
MakeupAddiction,ffc9aao,t3_de8h07,1579794465.0,I wish someone had answered this. I’m also wondering the same.
MakeupRehab,ffc85i8,t3_esuet5,1579793736.0,DING DONG!!! My favorite episode was the one with NikkieTutorial.
MakeupAddiction,ffbxydu,t1_ffbt9e8,1579786336.0,You had the right thinking. I also have hooded eyes. This is a very flattering look for hooded eyes. I wish I could do my brows like yours.
MakeupAddiction,ffbqpb9,t3_esl8mt,1579778883.0,You look so pretty. You make me want to be creative and have fun with my makeup “collection”. You look so comfortable in that turtleneck too.
MakeupAddiction,ffbqjz9,t3_esmu7e,1579778693.0,I love your eyeshadow. The makeup looks nice with your hair like that.
Ulta,ffa62gy,t1_ff9m0yo,1579728592.0,In March!
Sephora,ffa0i31,t3_esh0bx,1579725410.0,"That is a good question, how would you know which sample is which if they don’t label it?"
Ulta,ff9ndai,t1_ff9jrg7,1579716617.0,I’m not sure. I’ve never had a problem with not getting my points with Ulta. I haven’t heard of anyone else having the same problem. I spent $170 on Black Friday and a couple of weeks later bought the Dyson Airwrap when they had a 5X point AND 20% off. So it was $439 and I got over $125 in points back. So make sure to stack offers and coupons whenever you can!
Ulta,ff9iv5z,t3_esdbh8,1579713952.0,"Last year, starting Black Friday until Christmas Eve, they had a special offer for 350pts for customers who spent/charged $150 or more with their Ultamate card. I spent well over that amount and never got it until I called customer service recently to credit the points. 

Make sure you check your points balance and that you’re getting the correct purchase points, Ultamate card match points, and any other offer points."
BeautyGuruChatter,ff6b34y,t1_ff5rwia,1579623296.0,I would love to hear your thoughts on the palette.
BeautyGuruChatter,ff6aycu,t1_ff60mci,1579623212.0,There are bunch of YouTubers and IG accounts with 10% off codes for MUG too. They work on the new matrix palettes.
Ulta,ff6ai9a,t3_erwixu,1579622927.0,"The 20% coupon is good until 02.01.20. Happy shopping!

Edit: 02.02.20 is the correct date. My bad."
BeautyGuruChatter,ff67m54,t1_ff65z41,1579621044.0,"I can do one eye really good, but the other eye is always ugly, so then I have to even it out and then they both look like ugly stepsisters."
