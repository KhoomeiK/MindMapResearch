Archaeology,ffbizsk,t1_ffbiysa,1579767532.0,"In a Connecticut graveyard dating to the late 18th century, one grave stood out. Its occupant, a man who died about 200 years ago, had been dug up and reburied with his head and limbs piled on top of his ribcage, hinting that he was suspected of being a vampire.

Now, archaeologists have revealed the identity of the man, formerly known only as ""JB-55"" — his initials and age when he died, which were spelled out on his coffin in embedded brass tacks, The Washington Post reported.

Forensic scientists compared genetic evidence from the skeleton with online genealogical databases to ID the ""vampire"" as a man named John Barber. He was probably a poor farmer who lived a hard life; he appears to have died from tuberculosis, a representative of the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Silver Spring, Maryland, announced at a museum event on July 26. [7 Strange Ways Humans Act Like Vampires]

The condition of Barber's skeleton suggested that he suffered from a poorly healed broken collarbone and an arthritic knee, according to The Post. The tuberculosis that killed him was so acute that it left lesions on his ribs, and his excruciating illness and death were likely what led his family and friends to suspect that he was a vampire, Jennifer Higginbotham, a DNA researcher with the U.S. Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, explained at the event.

Commonly known as consumption during the 18th and 19th centuries, tuberculosis caused ulcers in the lungs and left its victims pale, emaciated and weak. Infected people often had bloodstains at the corners of their mouths from coughing up blood, and their gums would recede, making their teeth appear longer, Higgenbotham explained.

Tuberculosis is highly contagious. As epidemics spread through families and villages in New England, people interpreted the ghastly appearance of dying victims — and the subsequent sickening of their families — as part of a supernatural and monstrous transformation, researchers reported in an analysis of JB-55, published in 1994 in The American Journal of Physical Anthropology.

""Signs of life""
Suspected vampires' corpses were dug up and searched for ""signs of life,"" such as long fingernails and hair, bloating or fluids dribbling from their mouths. Though we now recognize these phenomena as part of a corpse's normal decomposition, in the past, distraught New Englanders interpreted them as proof that a beloved relative was a vampire, Higginbotham explained.

The so-called vampires' hearts were then usually removed and burned, according to the 1994 study. However, Barber's heart had already rotted away by the time he was exhumed, following his death and burial in the late 1800s, The Post reported.

In Barber's case, the skull and limb bones were placed atop his ribs in a position resembling a pirate’s skull and crossbones; in other cemeteries, this arrangement was used as a safeguard to protect the living from a suspected undead bloodsucker, Higginbotham said.

In other parts of the world, this and other techniques such as shoving bricks in corpses' mouths, were used to prevent alleged vampires from rising to feed on the living. Live Science previously reported.

""This was their desperate attempt to keep the vampire from returning from the grave,"" Higginbotham said."

AskHistory,ff8kvcr,t3_es8w76,1579683383.0,">And after this when a certain moderate length of time had passed, in the archonship of Aristaechmus, Draco enacted his ordinances1; and this system was on the following lines. [2] Citizenship had already been bestowed on those who provided themselves with arms; and these elected as the Nine Archons and the Treasurers,2 who were owners of an unencumbered estate worth not less than 10 minae,3 and the other minor offices from those who provided themselves with arms, and as Generals and Masters of the Horse persons proving their possession of unencumbered estate worth not less than 100 minae and sons legitimately born in wedlock over ten years of age. The new officials had to bail the outgoing Presidents4 and Generals and Masters of the Horse till the audit, accepting four sureties from the same rating as that to which the Generals and Masters of the Horse belonged. [3] And the Council was to be formed of four hundred and one members chosen by lot from the citizen body, and lots were to be cast both for this and for the other offices by the citizens over thirty years of age; and the same person was not to hold office twice until the whole number had been gone through, and then lots were to be cast among them again from the beginning. And if any Councillor, whenever there was a sitting of the Council or Assembly, failed to attend the meeting, he paid a fine of 3 drachmae if of Five-hundred-measure rank, 2 drachmae if a Knight, and 1 if a Teamster.5 [4] The Council of Areopagus was guardian of the laws, and kept a watch on the magistrates to make them govern in accordance with the laws. A person unjustly treated might lay a complaint before the Council of the Areopagites, stating the law in contravention of which he was treated unjustly. Loans were secured on the person, as has been said, and the land was divided among few owners.

- Arist. Ath. Pol. 4 

You need to look at Rhodes' commentary on this (just read the whole thing, it's amazing) and while Rhodes is particularly harsh on anything about Draco, dismissing much of it based on a small anachronistic elements (which I have argued goes too far) he really does have the best understanding of the source material and the history. 


>In the first place, then, he repealed the laws of Draco, all except those concerning homicide1 because they were too severe and their penalties too heavy. For one penalty was assigned to almost all transgressions, namely death, so that even those convicted of idleness were put to death, and those who stole salad or fruit received the same punishment as those who committed sacrilege or murder. [2] Therefore Demades, in later times, made a hit when he said that Draco's laws were written not with ink, but blood. And Draco himself, they say, being asked why he made death the penalty for most offences, replied that in his opinion the lesser ones deserved it, and for the greater ones no heavier penalty could be found

- Plut. Sol. 17

Plutarch is one of those historians that make us both shake our heads and be so fucking grateful he existed, he's so so so so so so biased and really bad about twisting history to make stories more exciting, but he's often one of the best at compiling information from sources that no longer exist, so always take him with a wheelbarrow of salt. 

> This Hyettus was the first man known to have exacted punishment from an adulterer. Later on, when Dracon was legislator for the Athenians, it was enacted in the laws which he drew up for the Athenians that the punishment of an adulterer should be one of the acts condoned by the State. So high did the reputation of the Minyans stand, that even Neleus, son of Cretheus, who was king of Pylus, took a wife from Orchomenus, namely Chloris, daughter of Amphion, son of Iasius.
