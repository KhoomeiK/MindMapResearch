I still think there should be a wavier to allow people to borrow and self-declare (within reason) ... It's great for the few people who know what they are doing however sadly most didn't and they were taken advantage of.   


The next big one will be the car loans at 1.5-2 times a persons salary!  Now that one should be banned!"

Some of the hoops they require now (at least where I'm from) are insane - as a customer it sucks, there are too many checks in place these days, to prevent money laundering in addition to lending people who can't budget correctly.   


Personally I think the regulations are too strict, I for one took advantage of more lax regulations 15+ years ago, and ended up doing well out of it."
awfuleverything,fd1z3oq,t1_fd1ebpj,1578139069.0,I saw a documentary on this a few years ago all wanting to be castrated in various ways.. among them was   I think a 16 year old boy who wanted to travel to some country where doctors would castrate him.  His dad pleaded with him to wait at least until he was 18  but his mum took him anyway.  A year later they interviewed him and he said it was the biggest mistake of his life.
