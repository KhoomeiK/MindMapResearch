BlackPeopleTwitter,ff67kbk,t1_ff4z8ub,1579621011.0,"It wouldn't. These gun nuts are committed to their propaganda and delusions. They go out of their way to defend their outlandish viewpoints. I was in a shooting recently. A month later there was another shooting at the same place. So many dumbasses coming out saying it was because the location was a ""gun free zone"", not because our state has gone out of its way to gut any common sense gun controls. That place being gun free or not wouldn't have mattered. 

I mean look, we're living in the scenarios they propose. ""we need more guns""... OK we have the most guns in the world per capita

 ""only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun""... OK, we have open carry laws. Good guys are welcome to carry guns. 

 ""if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns""... OK guns are extremely legal and accessible yet plenty of outlaws get guns. Not only that, plenty of shooters get their guns legally, so in a sense, more outlaws are created because of access to guns. 

And on and on. Those are the norms we are living by TODAY. And clearly none of that is working because we have massive gun violence in this country. There's just so rarely going to be a John Wayne around the corner prepared to take on a shooter. We can't rely on that. At least we would be better off relying on common sense gun laws. 

But if you point out that other countries who regulate guns have a lot less gun violence it's like the gun nuts can't listen. Pull the Westworld ""that doesn't look like anything to me"" as if they cannot wrap their heads around it. They're basically willing to live in a dystopia because of their fantasies and delusions of grandeur when it comes to guns."

For example taking clothes to the dry cleaner or getting wrinkle free clothes is worth the money to me when compared to ironing clothes every single week.

stocks,femkznh,t1_fem2t3l,1579260775.0,Thanks. I'm not really looking for that experience with this fund. At least not yet. It's just fun money I'm using to play the market and learn
stocks,femkykf,t1_fem3r8t,1579260735.0,How much are you up overall? Has it worked well for you?
stocks,femkx7g,t1_fem6bzt,1579260687.0,"Good points. I try to do this as you say. This particular stock that spurred this post was up 30% for me and I was pleased to let it run, but then it retracted and I got out with a 20% gain."
stocks,felpuf0,t1_feloy0m,1579228018.0,"Yeah, really makes you understand how people can be opposed to capital gains taxes. I already paid federal and state taxes on this money and now I'm taxed again. Oh well. Death and taxes."
AskReddit,felp1te,t1_felf3it,1579227466.0,"Yeah, nobody better be in here talking shit on tamarind"
stocks,felonk1,t1_felo2su,1579227196.0,"This is good advice, thank you. I will say for the instance that spurred this post, it was similar to what you describe in that I do not fully understand the stock and didn't feel comfortable in my confidence in the company's future. I felt like I made a silly emotional choice and got sucked into the hype machine and decided to sell at a gain in order to put that money in shares I felt better about.

stocks,felo4cf,t1_felmmdt,1579226830.0,"Thank you for the detailed response and not just hyperlinkkng Google lol. It was very helpful and I admit, something I had not considered seriously enough. That said, now that I think about it, I will likely have everything offset by losses once I cash in my company stock grant in a few months so I doubt it will matter. We're down enough YoY that there's zero percent chance it's not a loss."
stocks,felnk7e,t1_fellkwo,1579226446.0,This particular fund is just a hobby account to learn more about stock trading and have a bit of fun dabbling in the market. My more serious investments are all in my retirement accounts
stocks,felng5p,t1_felm62h,1579226368.0,"I don't know that. No one can. It could bump 20% more tomorrow. That was a risk I was willing to take. On the other hand, it could slide more and I could lose any returns. I felt that more likely. I figured if it rose more leaving leaving me stuck with that measly 20% return while missing out on greater returns, then that was at least a partial win."
stocks,feln4wx,t1_feliwux,1579226155.0,"Yeah man. I'm a big space nerd and we have cnbc on at work all day. I'm not even gonna lie: my nerd brain got sucked into the hype when they had their IPO and I bought some. It was definitely a learning experience for me, and outside of my normal character. I didn't do nearly enough research on the company."
stocks,felmxp5,t1_felia5m,1579226017.0,"I just figured 20% is a a great return in this economy, all things being equal. My reason is to use some 'fun money' to play around in the market a little to see what I can win more than I lose. This is not my retirement fund, this is not my family savings. This is a few hundred dollars that I'm using to learn more about stocks"
stocks,felmqpv,t1_feldy20,1579225885.0,"Oh I totally agree with that of I were looking at more long term investments in this scenario. As it is I am essentially using ""fun money"" to place bets on companies and see if I can pick more winners than losers."
stocks,fellsyp,t1_felbzpq,1579225237.0,"This is admittedly something I should have understood better before I started. Can I ask, what is the definition of short term? And are you exposed to taxes on any returns? Or only when you move the proceeds out of a brokerage account?"
stocks,fell696,t1_fel99tt,1579224810.0,"My overall investment strategy is to put a large amount in my Roth 401k and HSA, choose various funds based on the advice of my financial advisor (fiduciary. Doesn't charge unless we do business, so free advice on 401k), and let it ride. I don't try to actively manage my largest assets by any means. 

What I mention in my post is more or less ""fun money"" to give me more experience watching the market and companies. My main strategy is just to learn and win when I can. Just overall trying to learn and have fun."
stocks,feljx55,t1_felb5u6,1579223962.0,I don't know what this means.
stocks,felgymp,t1_felb26w,1579221931.0,I do typically. SPCE was on a huge tear lately but it retracted today and was heading further south so I took the 20% on the way down
stocks,fel7w0n,t1_fel7am5,1579215968.0,"That's good advice. I've got a few stinkers I'm holding onto but they were low cost to begin with, so I'm not as worried holding them. 

I made a rather large bet (for me) on Target recently. Was going good until their recent dip. We'll see how it goes, but I think once we get outside of the holiday news, it will pick back up"
stocks,fekspgr,t3_epkdrj,1579206805.0,"I bought some at the IPO like a dummy and sold it once I hit a 20% gain. There's not enough data for me to know how well the company will do, but I figure where else am I finding 20% gains in today's world?"
BlackPeopleTwitter,feh9x0k,t1_feh5jdh,1579112193.0,This is true. I try not to react to little stuff and my son usually just goes on about his business. Obviously there's not much that can be done about big spills though.
