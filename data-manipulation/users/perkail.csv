Communicate regularly but don’t set unrealistic expectations and most importantly don’t ever share news until it has materialized. If it hasn’t already happened then don’t share anything. 

Have fun. Before Kickstarter I was no one and now I set my own schedule and count myself among the most fortunate people in the world. 

My kickstarter project succeeded and then I failed to deliver it. 7 years later and I’m still sinking money and time into it. Luckily I have had countless new opportunities because of Kickstarter and have money to sink but my biggest piece of advice is to go for it but be prepared to deliver your promises no matter the time or financial commitment

America has invaded more countries in the name of democracy building and killed more innocent civilians than any other country in the world. 

If American conservatives don’t like your country then they bomb and invade it. That is a simplification but a stone cold fact. 

Only under Republican “leadership” do we pointlessly invade and most often fail at controlling these independent nations. What we do manage on the other hand is to greatly enrich Republican donors and conservative cottage industries like small contract defense. These are the companies that make gloves for instance or socks that our country buys to cloth the military. There’s literally thousands of the industries and maybe a portion are own by liberals but it’s doubtful. 

Under Republican “leadership” there are always controversy not because of the “fake news” or MSM but because with Republicans there’s always corruption. 

In corporate business we have a saying: If a method exists for generating profit, it’s your duty to explore it. Where Republicans always fail is in their greed. They are only fiscally responsible when they are in the minority and historically have always posted the worst growth and worst jobs numbers - always. In fact in the last 70 years no Republican administration has outperformed a Democratic one. 

You see it becomes apparent then that Republicans are only conservative when they exist as a minority and therefore due to a prolonged history of violence, greed and outright lies should be resigned to that minority forevermore. 

Only then can we begin to repair the damage you and yours has caused the good people of America and the citizens of the world.
