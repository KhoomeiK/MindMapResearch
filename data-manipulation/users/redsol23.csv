There are elitists on both sides. This argument is just as pointless as Xbox vs PS4 or Trojan vs Durex. It’s all just preference."

bulletjournal,ffclha1,t1_f5zwds6,1579801986.0,"Hey, I know this is a couple months old, but Notion on iPad is TERRIBLE. You lose a massive chunk of functionality. 

If you're looking for a good app for paper-like bullet journaling, you really need to use Notability or Goodnotes 5. Those are the creme de la creme."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff9not3,t3_esdowm,1579716806.0,"There is a LOT of back and forth horseback riding, but that is one of the very few negative things about the game. It’s excellent and you should get it."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff9n9lw,t3_esfcb8,1579716556.0,"One of my first modern horror games was Amnesia: The Dark Descent. In fact, that game fathered many of the horror game tropes common in modern horror. If you can, you should play that one first. It quickly becomes overshadowed by much scarier games like Outlast, but Amnesia was a hell of an experience when I was new to the genre."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff9n11q,t1_ff9kss7,1579716414.0,"I will say, the organic jump scares from Resident Evil 2 (looking at you Mr X) scared me a lot more than anything from Until Dawn."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff9msad,t1_ff8qkcx,1579716269.0,"If you’re all about instant gratification you won’t like it. It runs at a slow burn, and the game will intentionally force you to slow down if you’re trying to cram too much in at once. The point is to take it easy and chill, and that’s not something everyone wants out of their games. 

I’m personally a big fan of similar games like Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon, so Stardew was a natural fit, but so many people don’t like games that intentionally force you to slow down."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff9mkl6,t1_ff9f3io,1579716143.0,I felt the same about Bastion — didn’t like it at all — and I ended up beating Transistor a few times. Beautiful storytelling and world building.

NintendoSwitch,ff7h56x,t1_ff799pd,1579649433.0,"The ZX games are just as good imo. They are laid out like metroidvanias with one large interconnected world rather than separate levels. 

Plus, as a fan of the Zero games, you’re in for a **hell** of a treat with the secret final boss at the end of ZX."

ShouldIbuythisgame,ff28non,t1_ff28gig,1579497033.0,Well if you can’t afford it than obviously don’t get it. I’m just saying the game is well worth $60.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff28lpf,t3_eqvg8k,1579496985.0,"Nier is definitely worth it. The whole multiple play through things is misleading. Play through 2 is the same as 1 from a different perspective, so it’s still fresh. 3 and 4 are completely now parts of the story."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff28ida,t1_ff03phj,1579496904.0,The game library is massive and high quality. I’d say anyone not in the market for a Swirch should still consider the 3DS. It’s just a tad dated graphically.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff28fh3,t1_fey0erh,1579496833.0,"Warframe can be completely melee oriented if you play that way. I crafted a lance and equip it directly. I’ll spend a lot of time leaping, sliding, using telekinesis, and chopping dudes in half."

ShouldIbuythisgame,ff27y5j,t3_er51fj,1579496417.0,This game has far more content than most $60 games out there. If you think the price point is too high for an RPG of this quality than you’re taking crazy pills.

ShouldIbuythisgame,fd7jrbu,t3_ek7axd,1578205600.0,"I agree with everyone else — Pokémon Heart Gold / Soul Silver is the way to go. 16 badges, Pokémon follow you, best version ever made.

Aside from that, based on your tastes, here are some other recommendations.

-	Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies (I recommend this one just as highly as Pokémon Heart Gold, fantastic game, well over 100 hours worth of gameplay)
-	Chrono Trigger
-	Final Fantasy III
-	Megaman ZX
-	Megaman ZX Advent
-	Megaman Zero Collection
-	New Super Mario Bros
-	Digimon DS
-	Metroid Prime Hunters
-	Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass


Here are a couple of cult classics that I used to love. The reviews for these games are fairly low, but I remember them very fondly. I wouldn’t pay top dollar for these, but you may be able to find them cheap.

-	Lost in Blue 2 (don’t bother with 1 or 3, they’re both janky)
-	Hotel Dusk (point and click noire mystery)
-	Contact (Interesting 4th wall break of a game where you play as a person controlling a person on an alien planet)

P.S. Excellent choice playing The World Ends With You. I absolutely love that game. My first tattoo is of the player pin, since it was the first story to ever convince me that I need to leave my comfort zone, stop being a loner, and let people into my life. I attribute the lessons from that game leading to me meeting the woman who is now my wife. Plus it’s just a fine, fine RPG."
bearapp,fcyzltr,t1_fcsff76,1578090604.0,It costs like $1.50 per month. Kind of a weird price point to take a moral stand at. a bottle of water costs more.

me_irl,fcun8z2,t3_eiy6ss,1577984620.0,"Y’all need a password manager. 

If you have all Apple devices, Keychain is built in but it kinda sucks. 

If you don’t want to pay, LastPass is excellent, but it has a sort of bad UI and has had security concerns in the past. 

1Password is the gold standard. Super secure, uses biometrics, great UI, and can do 2FA checks for you. It costs $30 / year. Not a horrible price to pay to never have to remember a password. 

There’s tons of others too. They will even generate secure passwords for you so you’re not using the same one for everything."

It was like 3 am and my wife woke me up because she could hear one of them crying outside. We went out and offered to help. Door locks are a lot tougher than simple padlocks, but eventually we got it open. That’s the one time in like 5 years the skill came in handy, but I loved it."
