 >[This article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/zealand-mosque-attacks-brenton-tarrant-190316093149803.html) says that Scott Morrison, Australia's PM (yes, the same one that most of australia hates right now for letting it burn and doing little to nothing about it) described the NZ shooter as an ""extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist"". It also ways he expressed admiration for other violent white nationalists and acknowledged his intention to ""create an atmosphere of fear"" and to ""incite violence"" against Muslims.
>
>According to [this NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/21/725390449/accused-shooter-in-new-zealand-mosque-attacks-charged-with-terrorism), he described himself as a white supremacist and wrote an anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim manifesto before the attacks.
>
>As for the Pittsburgh shooter, according to [this ABC article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-alleged-mass-shooter-robert-bowers/story?id=58794586) the shooter posted his intent on Gab, a social media platform which is popular with white supremacists and the alt-right. [The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooter.html) corroborates this, as does [ADL](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/tools-and-strategies/shooting-at-a-pittsburgh-synagogue), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/pittsburgh-politics-violence-gun-reform/598885/), and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pennsylvania-shooting/u-s-prosecutors-weigh-death-penalty-for-accused-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooter-idUSKCN1ST12X) doesn't even refer to it by name, just calling it a right-wing social-media website.
