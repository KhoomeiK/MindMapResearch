tiedye,fcwl4dn,t3_ejapzy,1578028645.0,"I mixed up a batch of Dharma procion dye almost exactly 24 hours ago, followed all the instructions, and popped them in the fridge like usual. this was my first time using Dharma, in the past I've used jacuard. I went to grab them, and the yellow had sediment at the bottom, and when shaken got cloudy. All the other dyes look fine, but I'm worried/confused that they've lost their potency. Am I game or should I mix up a new batch?"

offmychest,fbzljty,t1_fbzi1rv,1577250804.0,"I know she's doing drugs man. She's showed me them, I've seen her take them. She's been hospitalized for od'ing. I just don't know quite which ones or how often.  I'm not blatantly assuming she's a druggie. I know, and I'm not judging her. I have no moral superiority over her. I'm just sad because there's nothing i can do and I love her so much. She's very wonderful.

I check it with her as much as I can. She was last hospitalized in October. She hasn't been using as much recently, I think. That's what I heard from her boyfriend.

I do appreciate your response. Most people assume the worst. Most people are very unkind. I would not have made this post if I only had suspicions. I understand how you could infer this, my posts pretty vauge lol"
weed,fbrwu4b,t1_fbqwies,1577047205.0,thank u! I am not in a position where I can replace Adderall with weed and the Adderall works quit well with for me with no side effects. I was most worried about the effects of mixing.
