AskReddit,ffigjbo,t3_etohsu,1579973338.0,"Generally ugly men always having super attractive girlfriends. It’s not only unrealistic but damaging to men and women (men’s expectations are high so they get disappointed, women think they have to be incredibly attractive to land a boring, ugly guy so their confidence plummets, making them more likely to stay with men that treat her poorly because she thinks that’s all she will get). 

There’s tons and tons of movies with average/below average men getting smoking hot girlfriends but I’ve never seen a movie where an average/below average girl gets a smoking hot boyfriend."

socialanxiety,ffdg01b,t1_ffd0q8v,1579820086.0,People are different and have different coping mechanisms. Why do you care so much about how someone handles their mental illness? You can have anxiety and depression without constantly being sat in a corner.
socialanxiety,ffcwbdv,t1_ffcw3be,1579808616.0,And Iâ€™m of the opinion that you shouldnâ€™t be heckling people about their illnesses unless you are a doctor/therapist. How do you know these people arenâ€™t already diagnosed?
