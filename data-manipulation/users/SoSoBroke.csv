Frugal,ffh08az,t1_ffgo8fx,1579919626.0,Any certain brands you like? I’m on the market for some well made but not designer clothes right now.
PublicFreakout,ffguo4c,t1_ffgk7w0,1579915511.0,Some places only have men’s uniforms and expect you to take what you can get.

1200isfineIGUESSugh,fff5ngu,t1_ffdgqz4,1579876331.0,"I ordered chipotle through their app so I could skip the line. They covered that shit in sour cream (I hate sour cream, even aside from the calories) and I didn’t notice until I was home. 

My boyfriend thought I was fucking insane for crying over a burrito bowl but he doesn’t know how it feels to skip lunch to save up for a ruined meal."
SubwayCreatures,ffexmqc,t1_ffenu32,1579869579.0,I agree!
relationships,ffe6x6u,t3_et36wb,1579838320.0,"No no no do not make any moves and do not tell your mom. It’s likely mostly just a crush bc he’s around all the time. I do not see it going well for you to tell your mom you’re into her boyfriend. 

Listen the age gap is creepy af but she is still a relative. You can have a problem with her dating someone so young, but telling her you like him would be like telling your sister you want to date her boyfriend. It’s her boyfriend and you liking him doesn’t make you any more entitled to him just bc you’re closer in age. 

That said, I’m really sorry you’re in this position, it would make me feel so weird."
TrollXChromosomes,ffe1l8r,t3_esy02d,1579834324.0,"Damn I’m sorry OP, that sucks. Like thanks so much for voicing your doubt, I’m sure y’all know better than I do! 

I don’t know why people have such a hard time believing that their impression of a person may not line up with their behavior in every other scenario."

JUSTNOMIL,ffcugs5,t1_ffc6j9v,1579807500.0,"Absolutely! I know some people take the approach of being very assertive with boundaries so they don’t get trampled later but sometimes letting sleeping dogs lie is just better for your own mental health. For what it’s worth, I’d probably do the same- not stir up more trouble but make sure she doesn’t get away with it again. 

Stay strong lady!"
AskReddit,ffcsg0q,t1_ffc0yoo,1579806319.0,"As someone who spent a couple years in the closet, trust me when I say you can hate doing it and get very good at it when the stakes are high."
nonononoyes,ffcs5rj,t1_ffch3xs,1579806152.0,"I see the similar logic you’re talking about, but I also see a distinction between using a dog’s natural gifts for a beneficial (if dangerous) cause and teaching dogs to do dangerous activities just for the spectacle of it."
JUSTNOMIL,ff6ulma,t1_fdzxcie,1579635201.0,Hey OP. I wanted to circle back and see how it went when you saw them again. I clicked on your profile in case you might’ve done an update on JNMIL and saw your post on breaking moms. Just wanted to say I’m really sorry to hear that there were no breakthroughs as of a few days ago. It sounds like you’re a bit insulated/isolated right now and I know that can be crushing and relentless. Hope you’re doing okay and hanging in there and sending you all the love possible!

wholesomebpt,fdnatov,t1_fdnas43,1578581756.0,I don’t think anyone’s asking you personally to.
wholesomebpt,fdn95s8,t1_fdn5n86,1578580599.0,I think people get that but there is still a victim in this crime to consider and some people would rather get involved even if it means putting themselves at risk
wholesomebpt,fdn8kzs,t1_fdn6g86,1578580183.0,I was just suggesting that it’s more likely than not there was someone to tell. But we’re arguing over a hypothetical situation which is silly so it doesn’t matter

wholesomebpt,fdn28wt,t1_fdn1hzj,1578575097.0,"If it’s at a bar, there is someone you can tell whether it’s the bartender, bouncer, or calling the cops. If you’re at a friends party or something then you should absolutely make a scene to make sure that creepy fuck is never invited back. 

It’s fine if calling the cops is too much work for you to do for a stranger but I can’t tell you the last time I was at a bar without a bouncer"

unpopularopinion,fdgqkkb,t1_fdfizuc,1578405718.0,"This whole thread is silly. Wtf does anyone care what another person identifies with? And the “Italians” that were raised in New Jersey still have a much stronger connection to Italian culture than I do, even if it pales in comparison to Italians from Italy. 

There’s clearly a divide in that a lot of Americans think of their heritage as where their ancestors are from and will say I’m Irish for example, but we don’t mean it like we’re ACTUALLY Irish in the way that actual people from Ireland mean it. We just mean that’s our fucking 23 & Me results, lol."

socialanxiety,fcnbju0,t1_fcn725j,1577808108.0,"I mean if you’re leaving events for no reason besides feeling weird, I would argue that you likely have some level of anxiety even if you don’t have an official diagnosis. Obviously the people who are like “omg I’m stressed about this text #anxiety” might bug some of us who have much more chronic and debilitating anxiety but the person who leaves parties early because they’re anxious - I don’t take offense to them saying that without a technical diagnosis. 

Am I misunderstanding you?"
