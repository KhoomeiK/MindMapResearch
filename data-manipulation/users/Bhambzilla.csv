Sephora,fenfvcp,t3_eoar22,1579283800.0,"I have the big briogeo conditioner from Costco. So no point getting another one especially since I heard these being all natural products, they tend to go bad. 

I am torn between milk and sol because i would love to try the milk makeup and I probably wouldn't buy if I were to pay out of my pocket and I love how the Brazilian bumbum smells and again couldn't get myself to pay for it as there are cheaper moisturizers out there."
