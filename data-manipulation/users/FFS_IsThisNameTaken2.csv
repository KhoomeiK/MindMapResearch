Respect the sleeping!"
clevercomebacks,fdyzav0,t1_fdtdq2h,1578785097.0,I'm a woman and thought it was hilarious. Literally lol'd.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdy5lr1,t1_fdy3n8x,1578776352.0,"My mom had a wrapper thing she'd wrap around her beer can when she was driving. It looked like a Coca-Cola logo. First person to ever call me a bitch and to punch me in the face with a fist was my alcoholic, narcissistic mother.

My kids have a hard time believing my stories about my childhood."

AdviceAnimals,fdxvbtb,t1_fdwyvp8,1578773301.0,I see this when people are driving too. Ffs! Put the gd thing down and drive or pull over and put it to your head. You're defeating the purpose of hands-free anyway if you're using a hand by holding the damn microphone up to your mouth.

Hurricane Harvey killed the closest Taco Bell to me. Next one is 20 miles away.

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdxqvdn,t1_fdwrcjy,1578771991.0,"Can confirm. Knew a computer engineer who thought Canada was part of the US. She's also what she calls a ""faternal"" twin, so there's that."
facepalm,fdxjus1,t1_fdwvszq,1578769492.0,My parents would look to me for an interpretation of what my little brother would say when he was learning to talk.

conspiracy,fdx7dn5,t1_fdwtt6q,1578766006.0,"What you copy/pasted does not say his organs were found at the gym. It says his body was found there. 

Sure, the statement could use a comma, but it's not saying what you're claiming it says."
conspiracy,fdx4yvd,t1_fdumo20,1578765409.0,"Nestle sells water it gets for free, at least it used to. It came out that they were not paying for the water they got from government land in California. Californians, on the other hand, were being forced to ration water due to a drought at the time. Rich people with giant lawns and estates were still able to water their hoards of land, and of course golf courses, though, iirc.

Not sure if they actually pay for it now, or if it's still free. I do not buy bottled water unless a hurricane is coming, or I'm not allowed to have my own stainless steel cup. Usually, I'd rather do without than buy water or drink out of plastic anyway."
