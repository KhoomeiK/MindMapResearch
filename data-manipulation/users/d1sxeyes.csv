budapest,ff6ipd2,t1_ff5xm58,1579628046.0,"Oh and one more tip, always choose to be charged in forints. For some reason they don’t let you do this at the airport (I’m not sure that’s legal but that’s another discussion), but in other places you might get offered to pay in HUF or EUR from your Dutch card. If you pay in EUR you will get a terrible rate. Pay in HUF and you’ll get your bank’s rate, which won’t be the best rate available, but will be better."
budapest,ff5xm58,t3_eruncq,1579613595.0,"As long as it’s a Visa or MasterCard, you should be able to pay for things with your Dutch debit card (but it’s not guaranteed it will work for the ‘lite’ versions such as Visa Electron or prepaid cards). If you have time, consider applying for a Revolut or TransferWise card as they’ll give you better exchange rates than your Dutch bank."

There are ways to write Vue which don’t require a build stage, but generally it’s harder to write, has less compatibility with older browsers, and is slower to load."

AskReddit,fdhfse1,t1_fdghb85,1578421723.0,"My sister has epilepsy, the advice we were given is 2 minutes fitting or going into a second fit immediately after the fit means call an ambulance.

They also said that if there’s any doubt then call 999, and she should advise her friends to call 999 if it’s the first time they ever witness her fitting.

Oh and while we’re on the topic, the ONLY first aid you should try and give someone with epilepsy who is actually fitting is making their environment safe.

DURING THE SEIZURE:

Ideally, move potential dangers away from the person fitting. If you can’t move hazards away from the person fitting, then make the hazards safe (eg: put a folded jumper under their head to stop them hitting it on things).

As a last resort, evaluate the risk the person is in, and if it is real danger, then carefully move the person away from the hazard, but don’t fight if muscles are stiff, and watch for flailing limbs.

Don’t try to restrain someone having a fit, and **definitely** don’t try to put anything in their mouth.

If you have something which is not valuable, cover their waist down - many people with epilepsy lose bladder control during a seizure, so if you have some kind of covering that you can afford to lose if it's soiled, then it may help to preserve their dignity.

If they're still fitting by the time you've checked the environment and made everything safe, the two minute point has probably already passed - call an ambulance.

Sidenote: Sadly, the healthcare system in the US is so primitive that someone with epilepsy may end up having to pay for an ambulance call-out. Your best bet is checking their wrists for a [MedicAlert bracelet](https://www.medicalert.org/product/catalog/medical-ids/bracelets)  which will provide guidance, however, it's **never** safe for a fit to continue beyond 5 minutes, nor for a person to go into a second seizure immediately after the first, and you should call an ambulance out anyway.

AFTER THE SEIZURE:

Try to put the person into the recovery position, but don't force them to do anything they clearly don't want to do. Be aware they are likely to be disoriented, confused, embarrassed and upset. 

If possible, get them help from a friend, family member, or ambulance crew before you leave them on their own. At least make sure that they're safe, coherent, and can answer questions like 'What's your name?', 'Where do you live?', etc.

It can be quite traumatic to witness a seizure, but the aftermath can also be almost as traumatic. The person with epilepsy may sound like they have brain damage, or have distorted speech. They may get angry or aggressive, so be as calm and stable as you can.

Note: I edited this comment to increase the time - we were told 2 minutes, but seems advice is 5."
