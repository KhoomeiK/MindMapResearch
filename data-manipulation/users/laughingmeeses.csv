todayilearned,fffkavh,t3_etain9,1579885804.0,Fauntleroy is a legend in the donkey/jackass world. Think about it like the “little engine that could”.
bestof,ffezh89,t1_ffevvwo,1579871346.0,"I did.

1) The article you linked completely undercuts your statement that ""The ARC wastes most of its money in executive pay, marketing, and administrative costs.""  The actual sources in your article show that they really only do keep 9% of all donations for overhead (please actually read your linked graph).  You clearly don't know what you're talking about here.

2) You conveniently ignored or didn't absorb the actual quotes from documents of the people in the organization saying that it wasn't going as planned and they needed to find a way to spend the money.  Literally, McGovern said  “Any ideas on how to spend the rest of this?? "".  They weren't looking to hoard the money like some shitty Smaug.

3)  There are multiple references in the 'first' article you cited to continuing land rights issues.  While some organizations were able to succeed in spite of those issues, they're certainly not to be ignored. This coupled with the fact that they worked to spend that money on multiple different aid systems and continuously ran into issues means they were in no way just trying to capitalize.

4) Everything you linked was obvious editorializing with no respect outside of being a cynical person who thinks they can prove something on the internet.  I have first-hand experience with the organization and this sort of demonization does nothing but undercut their efficacy in the future.  Surely they have a lot to learn yet and much more to develop but to link to one article that clearly editorializes based solely on the voice of Haitians, and another article that simply quotes something somebody else wrote sandwiched between editorialization, you can see how that lacks intellectual and bias reinforcing thoughts.

I'm sorry you have such a poor opinion of the organization.  Obviously this is the internet and I'm not going to change your mind.  I simply hope you find yourself willing to be a little more critical of information, especially when it's 5 years old and certainly doesn't reflect the current state of the organization, as it's had time to grow and learn."

bestof,ffbz562,t1_ffbyndq,1579787324.0,"What’s wild too is that the RC blood supply isn’t normally that expensive. It’s the hospitals who completely bend the patients over a barrel. I mean, I understand that the hospitals have to support their own storage, catalogue systems, and in-system logistics, but there are a lot of hospitals that are flat-out abusive with their pricing."
bestof,ffby2wi,t1_ffbx64i,1579786444.0,"The other important thing to remember is that it’s also split up regionally in the US. I worked for bio in the Greater Chesapeake and Potomac region. 

We were on point when it came to responding to any needs that would arise. When Baltimore and DC were completely shutdown for almost a week back in ‘10(?) from a severe snow storm I was coordinating and riding along with our transports to get supplies to shelters and blood products to hospitals.

I definitely think a large part of it is also the fact that people quietly take organizations like the RC or local disaster relief for granted. They just assume it’s a requirement that these services exist for their utilization without understanding the wild and complex logistics involved in even the most mundane tasks. Between the RC being beholden to a Voluntary Consent Decree since the ‘80s HIV issues and the actual economics of providing the services, it’s an Everest sized undertaking."

Some of them just wanted to feel appreciated. They were all great in their own way for different people and I’m still friends with a few of them.

Catharsis isn't inherently edgy but the desire to experience it regularly strikes me a little oddly.

I appreciate you taking the time to offer actual conversation instead of assuming I'm hear to shit on people like apparently half of Reddit is.
