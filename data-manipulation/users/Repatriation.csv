NoahGetTheBoat,ffjzow1,t1_ffjjzfr,1580011399.0,"PETA is heavily maligned on reddit, and the knocks against them are usually valid. What people miss is that they'll often do outrageous shit and make outlandish claims to get their organization's name out there in the public sphere. You have to admit - almost everyone knows what PETA is, and what they do.

Again, I don't approve completely of their strategy, but the notoriety they gain from their stunts does make videos like these more widely known as well. So at least there's a reasoning behind it."
NoahGetTheBoat,ffjzi6x,t1_ffjnfjc,1580011252.0,"If it helps, we're making progress for animal rights. Groups are seriously advocating for [elephants as non-human persons](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/12/happy-elephant-personhood/578818/), and their arguments are taken seriously nowadays. Circuses are closing due to valid criticism (this photo proves that), and elephant encounters in places like Thailand advertise 'no riding, no chains' because people won't go otherwise.

Yes, there are still major issues out there, like poaching, abuse, and of course climate change. Yet we've also made major strides in strangling the ivory trade, and just last year, a ban on the sale of wild elephants to zoos came into effect. It's not all hopeless. Not yet.

Advocating for animal rights and donating to groups like the World Wildlife Fund does make a difference. If this is an issue you care about, stay informed and make it a personal cause. They'd thank you if they could."
NoahGetTheBoat,ffjyvxu,t1_ffjo2w3,1580010761.0,"I've (unfortunately) read quite a few exotic animal control stories over the past few years. Do you remember back in 2012 (I think), when some kook lost control of his menagerie, and let dozens of big cats and monkeys escape?

The authorities killed them all. Tranqs are too unpredictable; if the animal has even one minute more time than they expected, it can still kill several people. Moreover, an ineffective tranq is an irritant, potentially aggravating the animal.

Killing the animals is a trade-off - the ensured safety of humans over the potential recapture of the animal. From an LEO perspective I can't say they're wrong to do it - the onus is on the animal keepers to keep these kind of things from happening.

Of course, the real solution is to not keep animals in private collections, sub-par zoos, and *especially* circuses. Too bad we haven't really gotten there as a civilization."

The way his plan provides funding to states comes with restrictions, such as not allowing them to use the funds for football stadiums or administrator salaries.
