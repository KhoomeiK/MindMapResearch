And the Razorback is still essentially a space ship?

>a vehicle designed to be sleek, fast as hell, and seat only two at the most

You're describing a supercar just as well as a sport bike. The analogy of ""Razorback is to ships as Ferraris are to cars"" is pretty apt. Plus you're forgetting the fact that the Razorback's sole purpose wasn't just racing. It was also a pretty major status symbol use to flash the wealth of the Maos. Something that supercars fill the void in today 

Sport bikes are made to go fast on a budget. That's the role they fill. It lets people with an extra $10,000 go fast and look cool. Slingshot racers in the Expanse 'verse are going to be the most apt comparison here, IMHO. Fast, cheap, efficient, anyone can get them. 

Meanwhile you have Ferarri's, Lamborghinis, etc. They go fast and they show everyone else around that you have more money than they'll probably see in a lifetime. That's what the Razorback is. A fast, sleek, limited occupancy, status symbol. A supercar."

Yeah, my city started a ""no plastic bags"" rule that directly conflicted with their ""all recycling must be bagged in standard trash bags"" rule

Firstly, you're forgetting the massive caveat that the spark has to be near something combustible. Leaving that part out further perpetuates the myth that oxygen is flammable. 

You can (but seriously, really, *really* shouldn't even attempt) set a fire in a 100% oxygen environment and suffer no ill consequences so long as you keep the fire contained (and don't inhale the smoke). Granted, controlling it in such an environment is significantly harder though

Secondly, the vacuum of space isn't the only reason an oxygen rich environment and spark alone won't cause the station to go boom. You'd need any fire to reach something actually explosive before the suppression systems can extinguish it. Failing something actually explosive catching fire even an open, uncontrolled flame in a 100% oxygenated ISS does not mean an explosion.

GoogleFi,fdqxq2c,t1_fdqvz33,1578676317.0,"Because there is complaint after complaint of them shipping to the wrong address or being stolen in transit, afterwards Google/Fi support is super spotty about rectifying it

Unless there's a deal you can't pass up, buying the phone from Amazon or Best Buy at the same price is almost always the best option

Edit: To the downvoters; All you need to do is type the word ""shipment"" into the [GooglePixel](https://imgur.com/a/NDY2MId), [GoogleFi](https://imgur.com/a/ZwtKzRc), or the (now defunct) [ProjectFi](https://imgur.com/a/Sn9Fpmm) subreddits and you'll see what I'm talking about. Stolen phones, lost phones, misshipped phones, Google not receiving returns, etc. The Google and Fi store are the retailers for an overwhelming majority of these cases and because you have to go through Google/Fi support we all know how that turns out. 

If you do a chargeback, [your account is banned.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/a9rxoe/fi_service_being_shut_off_due_to_legitimate/) If you don't do a chargeback, you can still end up fighting it months later and being charged [$1,000 while you do](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/eg1vi8/the_sorry_state_of_google_support_costed_me/)

That's not to say that every single case is like this. A coworker of mine received an empty box when he got his phone, and they had his replacement there a week later. 

But it is to say that it appears that the Google and Fi stores suffer these shipment issues significantly more often than other retailers."
GoogleFi,fdqqk87,t3_emqh1t,1578672745.0,"Went from Verizon to Fi for a few years and then recently back to Verizon. Here's my take:

1) If your end goal is to save money, look into other options. Unless you frequently leave the US odds are good that there's a cheaper option with similar coverage out there

2) \*#\*#346398#\*#\*. Dialing that code will switch you to the next network if you're having service issues (there are also dialer codes for specific carriers)

3) Do not expect the data speeds you saw on Verizon. For me Fi was adequate in general, but it also wasn't uncommon for streaming to be painful or even things like Facebook or Reddit to be slow to load

4) Rural coverage is there, but in the areas I frequented (Oklahoma, Arkansas, and California) AT&T and VZW had way less dead/slow zones 

5) You're going to want to use Hangouts. Imagine iMessage but on every single device you sign your Gmail into 

6) Do not count on Fi support for fuckall. And also try to avoid buying your phones through Fi or the Google store

7) If you do switch, you can get a Data Only SIM for free for any laptops/tablets you want to cellularfy. Best part is that you don't even have to pay a monthly line access for it

8) If you have friends on Tmo or Sprint in your area, ask them how they feel about their coverage, especially Tmo users since that's what the majority of Fi customers use more oft than not 

9) Accept the unexpected. Sometimes MMS, data, or even an entire carrier might go down. It happens on all carriers but Fi seems a little more prone to it. It's gotten significantly better, but you'll still have issues from time to time. Best to make peace with it early 

10) Look at deals other carriers have. For instance, AT&T also includes live TV and HBO in one of their plans. So if you pay for either of those already then it can make some of the difference up in the cost of the phone plan 

11) Keep in mind that Fi works with any phone, but it works best with only a relatively small amount of phones out there. You have a Pixel now and as long as you keep one then you won't have any issues, but if you ever want to switch to a Samsung or even iPhone you're going to be limited to TMo as a carrier on Fi"
buildapc,fdqillz,t1_fdpwk9d,1578667570.0,"Point of contention, but it's not always cheaper. 

[This build](https://www.ibuypower.com/Store/AMD-Ryzen-3rd-Gen-Starter) from iBuyPower is about $230 cheaper than [building it](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/zY8BrV) yourself with the same/comparable parts

Granted if you [cheap out](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/N9B38M) on everything possible, you can save about $100.

buildapc,fdqg8c5,t3_emnv3g,1578665885.0,"Pros of building it yourself:

\-If you wait for sales, you can get it significantly cheaper-You learn how to work on your computer-Great way to spend an afternoon

Pros of a prebuilt:

\-Anymore they tend to be pretty on par pricewise with DIY (at some points during the GPU shortage prebuilts were actually cheaper)-One point of contact for support, warranty, and RMA if needed-You don't need to spend a few hours getting it set up-You can generally still upgrade and swap out parts if you want

&#x200B;

I love building computers, but anymore if you can find XYZ configuration in a prebuilt and the cost is in line with a DIY build in the same config then I suggest the prebuilt

Edit: I take part of my statement back. Looks like still even today you can buy [this config](https://www.ibuypower.com/Store/AMD-Ryzen-3rd-Gen-Starter) about $200 cheaper than you can [build it](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/zY8BrV)"
