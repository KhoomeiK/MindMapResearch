But pumping was a whole different story, that was miserable, literally being milked by a machine for an hour only to get 2 ounces. I was home and just gave up. It wasn’t worth it."
whitepeoplegifs,few27re,t1_feth3ls,1579404456.0,This is so spot on!
whitepeoplegifs,fevzpd6,t1_fesakdr,1579403520.0,"All my kids aren’t in school full time just yet. I’m starting my own business slowly, I have hobbies, I have friends, but it is a strange place to be, where I need to be responsible for my parents as they age, take care of my kids, and start my career again. It feels like I Have so many roles to fill. I just want to go back a little bit when my kids where little and it was simple."
whitepeoplegifs,fes6ilt,t1_fers11f,1579361909.0,"The revelation I had recently that, I am the “commercial lady”! I am the lady that cleans her toilet, vacuums the rug, wipes the goddamned windows and drops the kids off at school...I don’t think of myself as a  “mom” , I’m not conservative in any way (values or style) but that night sealed the deal, middle age isn’t a number, it’s realizing you are fucking commercial lady..."
glutenfreecooking,fes0pkf,t3_eqh59h,1579360215.0,This is fantastic!
ThatsInsane,femqa5k,t1_fek2xhj,1579266440.0,"I’m a former dancer, not professionally but started as a young child and through my early 20’s and I have lots of “messed” up things from dancing...I’m naturally or unnaturally, depends on how you look at it, flexible and it takes a toll on your joints. I have SI joint disfunction."
AskReddit,femmppc,t3_epp36x,1579262853.0,So many classes!!  I could easily take two more dance classes and invest in some new tap and ballet shoes.
AskReddit,fdlso83,t1_fdl29vo,1578531562.0,"THIS is why I’m transparent and forthright with my kiddos. I don’t EVER want them to feel shame about their bodies in any way. I’ve always been open and honest with both of them. And when They ask and We answer. It was such a taboo subject when I was growing up, I could feel the tension and adversity. I want the opposite for my kids."

CleanEating,fd60fdv,t3_ek4mv8,1578183804.0,"Are you adverse to adding protein supplements to your diet? I count macros (protein goal on a workout day is 150 grams) eat clean, eat meat and still supplement with protein powders every once and a while. I’m trying to move away from animal protein sources myself. I love “ump” protein powder, I’ve tried sooo many and they are meh, at best. Ump tastes amazing. Fage greek yoghurt, all of the “Fairlife” milks have almost double the amount of protein, I’ve been experimenting with “bean flour” pastas like chick pea, black bean and legume pastas. Developing a recipe this week for a high protein vegetarian, creamy roasted butternut squash pasta. I included a recipe for my  “protein oatmeal”, it packs 30 grams, I hope you can use it. 
40 grams quick oats, 15-20 grams Ump protein powder graham cracker flavor (yes, it’s delicious)
1/4 tsp salt
4 Oz Fairlife skim milk
4 Oz water (or 8 Oz total Fairlife skim for more protein)
92 grams liquid egg whites (2 servings) 
1 tsp vanilla 
100 grams of your choice of berry 
Mix well and microwave for about 1 min, mix well again cooking in 1 min intervals and mixing each time, until you reach your desired thickness. I top mine with berries but sometimes add them at the end for the last min of cooking so they don’t get over cooked."
todayilearned,fczqfvh,t3_ejmgk4,1578106809.0,The ignorance is frightening! Our Daughter was signing at 6 mos and because of this she was verbal by 9 mos. I did in-home therapy with families who had children with developmental delays. And many of them were suspicious or hesitant when I informed them that signing would be a large part of bridging the gap for their nonverbal kiddos. I would get resistance and they would say things like “but I just want them to talk” and “it’s a waste of time” etc. but once we had our first session and I got that kiddo to COMMUNICATE to me using signs within an hour ALL doubts were gone. They trusted me 100% and many times within 6 mos id have those kiddos talking and meeting their developmental milestones.
todayilearned,fczp9mr,t1_fczl4cv,1578106175.0,Ditto! People send me those all the time and I have to take the time to educate them on why they aren’t appropriate and sometimes I just don’t want to be diplomatic and say stop with this oppressive Bullshit!
todayilearned,fczowq7,t1_fcziva1,1578105961.0,"Yes, it would be particular to the person. Rubbing their hands together, wiggling their fingers..."
todayilearned,fczo57k,t1_fcz4w7z,1578105502.0,"I too am fluent in ASL and taught our daughter to sign as a baby. I hope you “schooled” that ignorant doctor?! I’m also a developmental therapist and using manual signs/gestures is common strategy used with speech DELAYED toddlers and kiddos to promote speech, language and communication skills."
Instagramreality,fcuxgoe,t3_eixzmb,1577990483.0,I’m assuming these people make live appearances...? How do they justify how vast difference in their appearance?
AmItheAsshole,fct16r2,t3_eij1on,1577930214.0,"NTA, I would use this as an opportunity to talk with her. Maybe send her a card or a note that explains how her behavior hurts you and how much you thought about her etc when you picked out the gift. You can’t change her mind about you or how she feels or thinks she feels about you (she’s a teenager). Just talk directly about what you know and how you feel. That you would be more than happy to give it back to her BUT ONLY AFTER she apologizes. There have been a plethora of comments that say “awww, she’s just a kid, give her a break” FUCK No! Natural consequences, you cannot behave like an asshole and expect the world to cater to your “feelings”. The cop that stops you when you are 50 miles over the speed limit doesn’t care you are late to work cause you are having a bad day, you aren’t going to keep your job very long if you are rude to customers, and your utilities will be terminated if you fail to pay your bill regardless of your hurt feelings over your parents’ divorce."
