When it’s a guy who’s older than my father that flirts, it’s ok once or twice but if you’re getting half smiles and/or weak laughs, avoidance etc then you’re coming across as a creep and shes trying to be polite about it and that’s when you need to stop, not keep trying to flirt. 

Attraction is subjective though, so even if Brad Pitt said the same things to me, personally I would find it creepy because of the age gap."

I usually can feel myself shaking right before I fully drop off to sleep and I have a tiny horrible dream where I can still feel myself shaking so I have to wake myself up. 

Then I lay there for what feels like hours frozen and all clenched up and I feel like I’m shaking like having a seizure. I try and move my mouth to say my husbands name, or flex my toes just to shake the feeling but it could be ages. 

Once I unfreeze I usually have to get up for half an hour or else I’ll slip back into the same nightmare and end up paralysed again and it becomes a seemingly never-ending cycle. It usually happens when I’m over-tired."
