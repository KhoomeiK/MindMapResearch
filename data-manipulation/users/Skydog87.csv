worldnews,fgjjltz,t3_eyk6sf,1580845399.0,Why? What’s the crime?
todayilearned,fgg82ax,t1_fgg0jah,1580756259.0,"My great grandpa did the same thing at 20, which would have been in 1932. He never seemed to mind."
science,ffzgicr,t1_ffysfw4,1580377928.0,Thanks.
science,ffypf07,t3_evvfrc,1580351926.0,I read this a few weeks ago and have tried to find a lithium water or salt additive. Apparently lithium springs are not very common.
science,ffavwhb,t3_eskdpd,1579745712.0,I work for a major hospital in my area. Their pricing is considered a proprietary trade secret. Just shows it’s all made up.
pics,ff2po5k,t3_er52zs,1579518192.0,I would have done that too. It’s probably similar to seeing how far you can swim out from the shore and back when I go to the beach.
90sdesign,ff0swcc,t3_e97rap,1579471995.0,I bought this book at a flea market. Had no idea about the companion CD. Thanks for sharing.
science,fek9z9s,t1_fek865m,1579195688.0,"That’s what this article is saying. It strips away the rodents ability to fear all predators, not just cats. So I would assume a similar thing is going on in humans."
todayilearned,fek6jis,t1_fegtfi1,1579193651.0,"Thanks, for the link. Iv read similar studies seeming to give credence to the young blood rejuvenation hypothesis too. It sort of makes sense with whole blood transfusions. I believe this article was using serum or plasma. I think it’s similar to the difference between eating fruits and vegetables and taking vitamins. There are phytochemicals in the food that enhance the efficacy of the vitamins interaction with your body increasing their bioavailability. I feel it’s similar to a patient receiving anti-aging hormone drug therapies, they work, but receiving a whole blood transfusion from a healthy maturing individual may provide a lot of the benefits with less side effects, because you may also be receiving cell signaling compounds that can regulate your cells response to the hormones better. Hopefully preventing hypercellularity."
science,fek4emp,t1_fek1lvb,1579192372.0,"Yes. It’s not life or death but causes unnoticeable cognitive changes to the infected individual I.e.; the desire to care for cats and not mind their presence. It’s sort of like a cats way of hijacking their caretaker to be more attentive and sympathetic to their needs. But beyond that the host has no ill consequences, unless they are pregnant. I’ll double check that though.

You will have no noticeable symptoms as an adult as long as you are not immunocompromised; AIDS, Chemotherapy, old age."
science,fejemuw,t1_fejdn6n,1579170386.0,"Yes. It’s why pregnant women should not clean litter boxes. 
Here is some health info: https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/faqs.html"
mildlyinteresting,fejbpuk,t3_epgg5a,1579165973.0,Great picture. Incredible concept. I love it.
science,fejbk5r,t3_ep920p,1579165737.0,I learned in school the role it played in humans was making them want to care for the cats. Sounds similar to what the mouse experiences.
todayilearned,fegnyhp,t1_fege48z,1579098358.0,"Thanks for posting that.Even though these therapies appear fruitless, I fuckin’ love entertaining the ideas behind them."
science,febh92y,t3_eo7hwi,1578958764.0,Michael Crichton wrote a book on this problem called *Next*. Good book that dealt with similar issues like lack of government oversight and holding patents on part of an individual’s DNA.
science,febfnjx,t1_feanyrj,1578958304.0,This is what I have been saying for years. No one believed me til now.
gaming,fdxjefn,t3_en87zk,1578769236.0,"This is where I really want to go when I take vacation. The closest I can come to it is getting up at 0400, making fresh coffee, and some eggs in a a basket. Tip toeing to my desk to not wake anyone and play with one ear bud in so I can listen for when everyone starts waking up. I miss those days."
starcraft,fdp48g0,t3_e5meju,1578619622.0,One of them is not like the other...
technology,fdgfvzn,t3_el30uk,1578394937.0,I was just talking to my grandfather about this the other day. I’m floating the idea of starting a company that makes new old tractors.
