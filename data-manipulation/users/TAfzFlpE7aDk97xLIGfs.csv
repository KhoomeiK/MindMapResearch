BoltEV,ffuvhl6,t1_ffutui7,1580250114.0,"I can’t use it because it require my eyes to adjust to a different focal length which takes a second. Then again when I look back toward the windshield. 

It’d be nice if I had the car crammed full but otherwise I find it a little scary."
BoltEV,ffn42gg,t1_ffmhl3w,1580061843.0,"I did get the $3750 federal tax credit before it ran out at the end of August. Which made my total Premier price <$30k when factored in. 

So I’ve got that going for me, which is nice."
BoltEV,ffm41nf,t1_ffm2wcq,1580048026.0,"6kW extra battery capacity, HD cameras all around and some minor software updates. 

Had I known it was coming I could have waited a few more months. Not a huge deal though."
BoltEV,ffltyzg,t1_ffk6uzj,1580044184.0,I bought a 2019 in August and I have a very tiny amount of regret about not waiting for the 2020s. Congrats!
electricvehicles,ffijgzv,t1_ffie766,1579975335.0,Used battery-only BMW i3 morels are great at short ranges too. Can be found for low prices used.
BoltEV,ffieiy6,t1_ffieaq3,1579971966.0,"Honestly the Electrify America network is catching up to Tesla in terms of number of locations. Reliability is still a bit of an issue, but it’s improving quickly. Their map is impressive these days. 

But yeah, the wife will likely get a Model Y. 

(Or she’ll end up driving the Bolt and I’ll get a M3. Shhhhh.)"
BoltEV,ffidv0u,t1_ffid5t1,1579971519.0,"Will definitely update. It will be hard to compare since I won’t be as conservative with charging on the way back. I estimate I’d save $8-10 if I charged I exactly the same on the return trip. 

There is no question that that the 50kW max DCFC rate on the Bolt is slow. 

But.

I bought a 2019 Bolt knowing it was the slowest DCFC on the market because the battery pack was about the same size as a Model 3 SR for $14k less. And having just experienced what that’s like on a road trip, I am glad I saved the money. Faster charging would be great but it’s the battery capacity that makes the biggest difference. I think faster charging is secondary for me. 

Having said that, I would have purchased a M3 if my budget was different. And after GM’s emissions shenanigans I’ll likely be more willing to shift my budget around to accommodate Tesla when it’s time to replace my wife’s car. Which is really a shame."
BoltEV,ffhw17m,t1_ffh5zwy,1579956474.0,ABRP and Plugshare took care of most of the anxiety I had about taking a long trip. The last bit went away when we arrived. Definitely not worried about the drive back now.
BoltEV,ffhvyxq,t1_ffh6g7o,1579956397.0,"I do use L all of the time. I just prefer it at this point, but I also use a lot of cruise control and control the speed via the buttons on the steering wheel."
BoltEV,ffhv8fp,t1_ffh6jd9,1579955481.0,I didn’t but will for the return trip since it‘ll be cheaper.
BoltEV,ffhv61p,t1_ffh71wc,1579955396.0,"Noted. 

We have to make the return trip tomorrow so I can get that arranged before we leave."
