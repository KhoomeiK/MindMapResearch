And all the other legends except for the ones you mentioned and crypto (crypto drone would revive you by letting off EMP that stun enemies and revive multiple team mates) need to use actual syringes to revive you, so if they have no syringes in their backpack they can't revive you. Lifeline and crypto should have the ability to deploy their drone and revive themselves too."
