Awwducational,fe0a4k8,t3_endrki,1578807425.0,"Don't know if anyone mentioned this, but sometimes it is needed to amputate the tail because of an injury. For instance if the tail is paralysed it can be surgically removed to prevent further damage. In other cases, some canines are overly excited and thrash their tails against various things, causing both cuts and broken bones, and sometimes losing the tip of the tail in the process.

But to do this just because of a fashion statement is equal to getting rid of a finger because ""it looks cool"".

This is mutilation."
