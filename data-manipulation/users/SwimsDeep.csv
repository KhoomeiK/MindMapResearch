I would check it out just to see the difference because a good film job isn’t cheap either. The cheap ones are still like $100. and they always end up full of bubbles."
VanLife,ffgpuao,t3_etf5a5,1579912010.0,DEFINITELY worth the expense to upgrade to a one way tint. Have you checked out how much it would cost for tinted glass rather than film?
Backcountry,ffg5jr4,t1_fff1zm9,1579898918.0,I didn’t really know that about it being shorter...makes sense of course.
