Basically the only purpose it serves is that if your list isn't certified by the due date, you're not in the match. So if you certify a ton, you'll have less of those ""omg what if I don't match all because I forgot to certify my rank list"" fears (yeah, been there.)

But that grain of salt out of the way, I'd imagine discontinuing orders is only really relevant if continuing the same order would *actively harm* the patient. So don't worry about orders that are just somewhat obsolete, like IV meds when they can probably tolerate PO.

Your next question is actually answered in the PDF: ""Medication duration is assumed to be optimal."" You don't need to specify that your prednisone burst or abx course isn't a long-term med (and there isn't a way to anyway). 

In all the tutorial videos, they show advancing time one result at a time, but what I did was after my initial battery of tests I'd advance time until the last of the short-term tests would be back - the advancing will stop when a result comes back, and you can just click ""okay"" and ""continue advancing"" instead of having to manually do it every time."
