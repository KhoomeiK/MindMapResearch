You have a bigger challenge than most, but you will be able to handle more as time goes on and you learn new ways to cope, or come up with innovative solutions to your problems. 

Keep in touch my friend!"

relationship_advice,feierk6,t3_ep5s6y,1579136819.0,"I have a similar experiece. In the past, the people id sleep with would always initiate. I had very low self esteem. But now with my partner, he doesnt seem to respond to me initiating. Weve talked about it, he only likes to do it in the evening when we are already in bed and tired... but i want to do it in the kitchen, the livingroom, the bathroom, or just in bed when i have energy and im awake, why not? He wants it this way because he gets exhausted and sweaty and just wants to go to bed after. There are rare compromises. I mean, we dont even do it on holidays anymore. I have always been very physical, it helps my confidence, i feel more me, more alive when im nude. He wants to excersize, but doesnt. He wants to work on his depression, but refuses therapy. I almost got him into just doing yoga, but hes not interested anymore. 

Im learning that you can talk many things out, but some things wont change because that is just who they are. 

Damn, what do i do?"

We all have receptors that react with the cannabinoids found in cannabis such as THC, CBD, CBG, CBN, and terpenes.

They collect and conduct studies around the world on cannabis. Theres way more to it than just THC."
