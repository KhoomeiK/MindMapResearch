truerateme,ff20p67,t1_ff1xq01,1579490688.0,i’ve been with someone for 3 years luv. lol..thanks?
addiction,ff1sftl,t1_ff1qn1m,1579485156.0,you got this! therapy helps a lot. wishing u the best.
truerateme,ff1sdcu,t1_ff1pt4y,1579485113.0,too much in my eyelashes? lol i’m not sure what that means but yeah my lipstick faded and my lip liner did not but that’s okay. either way thanks
truerateme,ff1pkkc,t1_ff1nora,1579483331.0,thanks! but you really think so? this was on thanksgiving but i still don’t have much face makeup on at all. barely wear any regularly but appreciate your input!
addiction,ff1iplk,t3_er3h4n,1579479846.0,"this is exactly how i became an opiate addict lol. i would suggest talking to your doctor - you don’t have to say it was your mom, but it will be a lot easier to get help now rather than down the road, if you are susceptible to addiction. good luck!"
addiction,ff10pf3,t3_eqx3gu,1579474063.0,"yes, this is me with cocaine lol always been interested but i would probably have multiple panic attacks if i ever did it."
addiction,ff0uzzw,t1_ff0ukts,1579472528.0,"thank you. either way if i was to relapse or not, at the end of the day i’m still doing the same addict bullshit i used to. trying my best."
depression,ff0tn50,t3_eqs4h8,1579472174.0,"THIS!!!!! i always think about shit i can’t wait to be normal and happy but then again shitty situations seem to get worse over the years, and every fucking time they feel like the worst time of my life. i hate that i’m so pessimistic but i’m just being honest.."
Codependency,ff0s81c,t3_eqw8pz,1579471781.0,this is awesome. i saved this to my phone because i know i’m guilty of it and so is my boyfriend when we are at our worst and fight. i think as humans (but especially us codependent ones)it is good to recognize our manipulation tactics that we use while we are frustrated because we often are so caught up in the moment of it all. thanks for sharing.
antiMLM,fezyoga,t1_fez9nxr,1579463355.0,my thoughts exactly. i’m 120lbs and i would be in the damn hospital if i lost that much weight. it’s fucked up to prey on women who want to lose weight.
antiMLM,fezycdg,t1_fevl06p,1579463214.0,"yep, exactly. that was me 110%. i got sucked in for a couple months in college. i got to keep the products i bought for my entry fee, and thankfully they weren’t ALL awful for me however i still think it was the most naive decision i’ve ever made. these people are predators. point blank period, it’s sad."
OpiatesRecovery,fdesazn,t3_ekvxst,1578345567.0,"today kinda sucks. between my mental illnesses, PMDD, unemployment, and the fact that my boyfriend is in another country is just making me so fucking lonely. i was able to find some money for my subs, and i got a taste of withdrawal today, and it was already starting to snowball. need to find something to keep me busy. just over 3 months clean though.."
Codependency,fddwuvr,t3_eknkve,1578325934.0,this is precisely what i needed to hear at this moment.. but i’m still struggling so much..
Codependency,fdbnd3f,t3_ek7z32,1578259082.0,"ugh this is me! my boyfriend is in cancun right now on vacation and i haven’t seen him since monday.. he’s not coming back til tuesday. so obviously he’s having a blast and suuuper busy so the little time we get to chat i feel way better. and the longer in between texts, the worse i feel... i hate being like this!"
Codependency,fdbcp0m,t3_eka1iu,1578256064.0,i am so sorry. this is exactly how i would feel if me and my SO broke up.. luckily it’s been good for now.. but still. i have been there and i can only imagine the pain you are enduring. you are so strong. just remind yourself of that.
trees,fdb53mh,t3_ek71go,1578253930.0,my brother is 13 and i could only hope he would know me this well. this is amazing.
depression,fd0nfb6,t3_ejdj5b,1578121227.0,my uncles ex wife committed suicide (with a gun) and LIVED but is now totally different and has a new personality because of how she did it... ever since then i always think about that when i contemplate suicide. what if i don’t make it? like what if i survive but am disabled or something? it would only make it worse. i’m holding on to see if i can change my life in the future.
addiction,fd0hsu7,t3_eisgg3,1578119000.0,they are probably replicating the act of getting ready to snort their drug of choice. it’s like the same thing about how people who smoke cigs like the idea of having something in their hands to mess with.
addiction,fd0h2k1,t1_fd0ebfg,1578118690.0,they are the most realistic for me because i was able to handle all of this at least most of my life. i’ve always worked in a corporate environment but i’m so desperate right now i’ll work in a warehouse for $9 an hour.
addiction,fd0ci8h,t3_ejapxx,1578116876.0,"tbh yes. the only thing i lost before getting sober was money and my job. i still deal with others not trusting me as much, but they are here for me regardless. i think it’s possible."
addiction,fd0c15v,t3_ejjws5,1578116687.0,"if you were with her before the addiction or maybe if she was serious about getting sober, i would say that maybe it’s worth it. but it’s just not. you just don’t know her well enough, most likely. 

that’s coming from an addict who wasn’t an addict till a year into my relationship, but i hid it well until i decided to get sober. if you can be friends with her - awesome. but if you have too many feelings i’d stay away. i’m so sorry i can’t imagine how this must feel, i am 23F and sober now but really this is a shitty situation overall."
addiction,fd0b3ar,t1_fd09hhe,1578116299.0,"definitely! i think the brain fog will be the hardest. and the fact that you knew you wanted to take a better dosage to get off shows a lot about your commitment. i’ve been cold turkey off of pretty moderate xanax/klonopin use in the past (mostly just binges) and to be honest it was not awful however that is in comparison to the opioid withdrawal lol. i am about to go cold turkey actually of suboxone as well. i have faith in you, we got this!"
addiction,fd0987p,t3_ejkqi8,1578115518.0,i’m having the worst day i’ve had in months but i’m still keeping positive. pm me anytime
addiction,fd08ywc,t3_ejl4vn,1578115410.0,"i don’t think that with that small of a dose you will feel much, BUT i’m also not a doctor so i could be wrong so don’t take my word for it. but honestly i think more than anything you’ll struggle with anxiety. try looking into CBD. it will likely work great for you since you have been on an extremely low dose. 

i think that you’ll be more than okay but you’ll likely deal with those annoying anxiety symptoms like you mentioned. maybe some irritability. try meditating and exercising to ease it. good luck."
addiction,fd085wu,t3_ejkhm6,1578115071.0,"i’m 23, going through the same but i don’t really like NA or AA that much. even if you do go, feel free to reach out. i feel like i am sure i know how you feel!"
OpiatesRecovery,fd05xhe,t1_fd01azx,1578114110.0,"2mg bupe / 0.5mg naloxone. i’ve been on this same low dose since i started 3 months ago. heavy vicodin & occasional recreational methadone use for a little over a year prior, i was in day 4 of wd when i took my first sub strip."
OpiatesRecovery,fd016uf,t1_fd014c8,1578112096.0,oh i don’t think i mentioned that i have one film left. lol. but thanks :(
ILTrees,fczdjm3,t3_ejohqx,1578098785.0,thank u for this i was thinking about going. i was also thinking rise but their prices look insane.
suboxone,fcz2c8e,t1_fcz03l6,1578092252.0,"actually, i used to purchase some from my local smoke shop it’s legal as far as i know! i’m going to try it out again, see if it helps. before i used to get the capsules and they didn’t do much. ill try the powder this time, just not sure of the quality of what i have access to. i’ve always worried about this but never thought to save them and i know i could have. wish me luck, thank you"
suboxone,fcytpf9,t1_fcyptc3,1578086866.0,"yeah, i knew it shouldn’t be taking this long. maybe it’s my stare. i applied on Illinois ABE or something. i’m not sure if it’s the same, or what the difference is? but that’s where everyone i knew applied for it."
suboxone,fcyltcp,t1_fcylgc5,1578082383.0,2mg. i was only on 2mg/0.5mg twice a day morning and night so i took one this morning and have the one left
Codependency,fcwogyv,t1_fcwntb8,1578031623.0,"that’s awesome, thanks so much for the reply. it’s crazy how much i can relate to you im very surprised i’m not alone. getting the motivation or creativity to find something to do and do it is the hardest. pm me any time i think maybe we’d be able to vent and relation in order to heal properly. god bless you."
depression,fcwkaal,t3_ej9ogq,1578027949.0,i understand. it’s the same for me.. hope you all had a good vacation!
depression,fcwk16v,t3_ej77hn,1578027741.0,i feel this so bad
