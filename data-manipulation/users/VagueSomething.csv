With tech advances and the possibility of an extreme government. It could be used to hunt those who vote against the future government. It could be used to track people who break a new authoritarian law. Remember that governments lose data and even sell our personal data. A record of who you are mixed with pictures etc could be used for fraud or blackmail.


The government literally accidentally made public the addresses and details of celebrities during the Honours the other week. There's been multiple events of government workers losing data. The beginning of 2019 saw the largest leak of people's accounts and passwords online, believe it was close to a billion separate accounts. Now give those who steal data a new database to steal and what you could use a detailed database with facial pictures. Fake ID, passports. Remember the government planned to do the Porn Register which could see a return potentially and now add your face to a list of your personal habits and how that could be used to extort wealthy people or lead to horny young idiots committing suicide rather than be outed.



The sheer collection of data isn't a benefit for the government unless it plans to continue and develop China's system where everything is tracked. Do you want to be blocked from loans because you were near the site of a protest? Do you want to be denied access to public transport because you posted something online that was critical of the government? 



Combining the unknowns of the future with examples from places like China now and the history for government errors releasing data and how bad cyber crime is. It should make you uncomfortable. Even if you've done nothing wrong, you may be near when it happens and take the blame. A sinister government could use it to frame you.


The tech already exists to fake video and audio of people. There's some fantastic Deep Fake type content that shows the tech is already here to make lies with digital content. You want another database for people to hack and steal your data? Remember that twice now autistic British men have hacked the American government's computers. You have faith that the current government or the next government will adequately fund IT for security of the database?

Them being open minded and feeling safe to experiment can let them enjoy new things and push their previous boundaries without fear. Knowing when not to push and building a connection can see a normal relationship grow into kink play if you're not dependent on a fetish from the start. All women are a little different but it's certainly not too rare for them to discover they enjoy a level of control or power play. 



It's entirely understandable why online dommes lean towards charging, it isn't easy and the supply and demand favours them prioritising for those who commit financially. Most subs tend to dom from the bottom and have the power by pushing for what they want over what both enjoy so it makes sense to get something back as a domme.

thewalkingdead,ffcml9d,t1_ffb367w,1579802655.0,"Toxoplasma Gondii parasite causes depression in humans and is one of the more common parasites, is passed through cat shit. Can causes serious illness in immunocompromised people too. It's a good starting place for hypothetical zombies. 


Multiple parasites take over the host to force it into situations where it can spread itself. Mice willingly getting eaten by cats to spread it. Fungi types that take over insects and arachnids to then make them climb high so they can turn into solid statues that spray spores to repeat the cycle. 


Nature is full of examples of how a zombie outbreak could come about. Biological warfare aimed tampering with such parasites and fungal spores could be used to spread a zombie like illness. Hell look at Rabies and imagine weaponised Rabies for a moment. In theory to be effective as a weapon whatever altered and bred biohazard would need to damage the immune system to prevent fighting the parasite. That then could potentially open the door for Necrotizing Fasciitis as a side effect of injury and secondary infections caused by reckless behaviour. Realistically you'd see something closer to 28 Days Later ""Rage zombies"" than Romeo but it's not entirely crazy. 


The voodoo zombie comes about from the idea of poisoning effectively making someone's vitals seem gone in a non modern examination so they'd suffer brain damage and likely be discarded or buried which could leave damage to their appearance. A weaponised bio agent could easily damage the brain and cause the struggling movements and inability to talk.


For any of these to effectively take over it would require a mass simultaneous infection to spread out of control. The conspiracy theory of chemtrails would feed a fun crop dusting effect to infect large areas who then attack each other. America considered trying to make a Gay Bomb so the idea of spreading a bio agent that's initially non lethal isn't crazy.



It's true that it would be hard for it to go out of control in an apocalypse event but if it was say a foreign attack on a country that manages to attack multiple major areas before detection it could maybe fuck a country, especially if it doesn't immediately show symptoms so spreads further and they target military and civilian locations."

gentlefemdom,ffcaqxr,t1_ffbsq19,1579795383.0,"I think the struggle for people to find dommes is a catalyst to the problem. There's far more openly seeking subs than dommes and this leads to a desperation to fill the void. When someone finally shows an openness it gets over used because subs don't know when they'll get it again. It's hard to find a loving domme without parting with money and it's hard to truly believe it's affectionate if you're paying.



The best submission is to those who know you inside out, quite literally. The truth is more exciting than lies. Unfortunately it is not easy to find partners who are immediately into your desires so you either compromise or hope you can build towards it more often than not.

WoWs_Legends,ffbjnro,t1_ffbdtmh,1579768456.0,"The Yamato has failed to meet their expectations. They have had to no longer class it as 3 ships which shows it under performs and breaks the balance but not how they thought. There's no point naming tier 8 Legendary if they're not special. Half a dozen ships in the game at lower tiers are literally legendary ships of great renown so an arbitrary Legendary tier that isn't different is pointless.



For now they'd be better off working on building tech trees of the partial nations then releasing a tier 8 later on if they want bigger ships. Yamato has failed to blend with this test."

They will probably release an enhanced version that is USB-C in a few years along with improvements but right now USB-C to USB-C isn't the norm. Right now every phone charger is USB to USB-C, every plug and play for the current gen is the old USB, most external storage options are NOT USB-C.
