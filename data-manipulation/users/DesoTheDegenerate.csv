Justrolledintotheshop,ffj84g4,t1_ffj2be7,1579992738.0,I’d rather compress vertebrae than punch a hole in my skull tbh.
gaybros,ffj7je1,t3_etv3th,1579992348.0,"I made a grindr with one pic of me and got flooded with a bunch of VERY forward dms, it scared me and i didn't reply to any of them. I feel kinda bad but my fragile ass is new to this whole being gay thing and i didn't realize that getting hookups on grindr is apparently the easiest thing known to man, and it kinda scared me ;_;. SO many old men that i recognized from around town, I live in a conservative area so it kinda blew my mind a bit.

Guess ill stick to posting on reddit knowing that everyone is gonna be at least 100 miles away lol"
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffj33o7,t1_ffii997,1579989168.0,Def the latter. You cant really fake it as a judge without knowing what the prosecution does. Knowing that the prosecutions job is the prosecute the defendant is probably the most basic part of law. You could ask anyone off the street and they would probably get it right. Much less someone who actually worked as a judge.
GlobalOffensive,ffj2pob,t1_ffizcez,1579988894.0,"I am perfectly fine with that. When the game dev controls the competitve scene, if they fuck it up you cant really do much. But when you have tons of different leagues, if one fucks it up you just forget about them and move on. And you don't have to worry about the dev abandoning the comp scene either. Its probably why CS has remained competitive for as long as it has."
knifeclub,ffhlmu9,t1_ffhkwxz,1579941111.0,"Yuuuup. Was re profiling the blade to 25 degrees because I don’t like the stock angle, using a shitty smiths linear sharpener with no base. Got it hair popping sharp, and when looking at the finish with it still in the clamp I dropped the whole thing somehow and the knife plus the weight of the clamp fell onto my thumb. 

Cut it deep enough to cut into the nail, thumb started gushing and bleeding down my arm and dripping off my elbow. Thank god it’s sharp tho, the cut was super clean and by putting a ton of pressure and soaking through some paper towels it sealed back up! Now the bandaid is putting pressure holding it together and I shouldn’t need stitches."
INEEEEDIT,ffhaeyg,t1_ff8ymfa,1579927844.0,"You never heard of this?

Tons of people love the smell of gasoline. For me it has a lot of strong memories of riding dirtbikes when I was younger on top of smelling great. Gunpowder has a similar sentimental place in my heart, reminds me of afternoons spent shooting at my grandpas property."
EDC,ffh2iar,t1_fdru2b5,1579921352.0,"I hate sharpening them pretty much. They would make cutting some things easier, but really you can almost always use a straight blade for the task. 

I use a lansky sharpening system and it can put a mirror polish on my blade pretty damn easy once you get the right stones and some polish compound with their leather strop attachment. Takes like 10 minutes to restore the blade to a mirror once every week or two. I would never be able to achive the same level of hair splitting sharpness on a serrated blade, because they just dont make strops that fit in those crevices. Not that it needs to be a mirror polish, but it just looks pretty lol."
knifeclub,ffg6hi8,t1_ffg0id7,1579899495.0,"I like the material of the scales, but I prefer a more machined look like the mini grip or the bugout. 

Black hardware is a must, tbh I wish I got the carbon fiber variant with a black blade lol."
knifeclub,ffg0lla,t3_etfig0,1579895871.0,I’m already planning on getting a black mini deep carry clip from the bugout. I’d like to source some black hardware and some white G10/Glass Filled Nylon scales.
knifeclub,ffehjwv,t1_ffdap3y,1579848273.0,"Holy fuck the mini bugout. I am in love. I think that is the perfect knife for me. 

[This model is perfect out of the box.](https://www.benchmade.com/533bk-1-mini-bugout.html) That is exactly the color combo i wanna build a mini grip to but i like this knife design more. Add a black backspacer for more rigidity and more grip and I don't know if i would ever use anything else."
knifeclub,ffd9dr5,t1_ffd161r,1579815992.0,"The bailout looks interesting to me, but I really mainly carry knives that are just the blade as the only tool. It’s just a personal preference though. 

Smaller knives are wonderful. I wish they still made the bench made sequel, it reminds me of a mini 940. A 940 with the same blade length and overall length of a mini grip would be my dream knife. I ordered my first 940 yesterday and even though it’s coming Friday I’m still checking tracking to see if I get lucky and it comes today lmfao. 

Unfortunately I’ve misplaced my mini grip. I’m not to upset about it because I never really cared for the 154cm it came with. Hard to sharpen compared to my s30v spiderco manix lightweight. My 940 has the s30v blade so hopefully it will sharpen amazingly. 

I still think that the mini grip will be a more comfortable knife than the 940. It’s seriously just so nice to hold, and the action feels amazing in that form factor. Makes me wanna hold a bugout sometime but I still think my next knife will be a replacement mini grip."
knifeclub,ffcw9if,t3_estsha,1579808583.0,"Personally id run away from this one. 

Get it?

Ok ill leave"
knifeclub,ffcw4nk,t1_ffbynhn,1579808502.0,I dont know what this knife is but i feel like im too poor to even look at it. Maybe its the use of gloves lol.
knifeclub,ffbv6zl,t1_ffb75mg,1579783862.0,"Check out the mini griptilian line if you like the feel of the bug out. Same materials but in a smaller and more ergonomic package. Best part is you can get them for $100, and if you wanna spend a little more you can customize them in any blade combo and color combo possible."
furry_irl,ffaxe4y,t1_ff9pv71,1579746703.0,A lot of animators and artists seem to be furries. I bet that just being in the art community and being into art starting at the age many of these popular low key furry artists are has a loooooot to do with it.
pics,ff6td14,t1_ff5cdmo,1579634476.0,"Yep. In 1936 the NFA was introduced. It put a $200 tax stamp in the way of owning a short barreled rifle, shotgun, suppressor, or a machine gun. Insanely expensive for the time, basically just prohibiting the poor from these things. 

Nowadays the cost is still $200 which is quite a bit more affordable. But since the 1986 machine gun ban machine guns have gotten insanely expensive. Like $30,000 for a pre-1986 M16. Once again, keeping certain weapons out of the hands of the poor. 

The politicians who enact these laws care about protecting their own asses from the working class citizen, not about saving lives."
