Miata,fesnzlx,t1_fes85lx,1579367271.0,"What you can also do is sell the 3, buy a used sedan for cheap, I recommend a Civic or Camry, and get an NA. With the extra money saved from not having a monthly payment you can tinker on the NA. The NA won't lose value quickly like the ND unless you go crazy with mods, so if you don't like it, you sell it and still have your other vehicle.

If you go all in on the ND and rgealize it's not what you were expecting, you'll be in a bad situation as the vehicle will tank in value when you sign.

Final say is up to you. I can't say too much as I bought my NC sight unseen and love it.

Make sure you get the title and you are not paying the car off for your dad to sell out from under you or giving him money that he ends up not using to pay the vehicle."

NintendoSwitch,fdfxnli,t3_el3vmm,1578373064.0,"An option if you don't mind some extra bulk is the [Switch Fixture](http://fixturegaming.com) with a pro controller. 

I went a different route and have a goose neck mount with a Mayflash adapter paired with a PS4 controller. This setup requires you have a surface to mount the tablet as well as a PS4 controller laying around. Much better D pad and symmetrical sticks. You can also go the SN30 Pro + if you don't want a dongle hanging out and don't mind spending a bit more.

Plenty of solutions out there, good luck."

AskReddit,fcmdfzg,t1_fclp1wn,1577771337.0,"Where I used to live there was an outdoor cat that was declawed, it even had a tag saying ""Let me go and I'll go home."" So we drive him close to his home, there was an address, and dropped him there. Next day our neighbors brought him over asking if he was ours, he then proceeded to walk into our house with no hesitation. We would have taken him in, but we have 3 cats and they would eat him alive. We drove him to the humane society so he would have a warm place to stay as it was December in Minnesota.

Poor guy loved everyone, but if attacked he couldn't even run up a tree with no claws. I hope he found a good home."
