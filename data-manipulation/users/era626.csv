Outdoor rinks as a rule are often weirdly shaped. But they're often for people to go skating as opposed to figure skate.

I, a trained skater who can do much more difficult spins, had to go to the ER for stitches after a scratch spin went wrong. Any spin is above the level of self-teaching. Self-teach edges, crossovers, etc all you want. No one is saying quit, just that you need a coach for certain skills. Athletic activities are not like language, music, or math. You can hurt yourself. Skateboarders aren't a good comparison because they hurt themselves.

You are on ice. You can get a bad concussion simply from slipping and falling. To be a real skater is to respect the ice and to respect your skill level. 

You've mentioned watching videos of falling so you think you know how to fall. No. Muscle memory is how you stay safe. Heck, for the spin-to-ER, I could have hurt myself much worse if I hadn't know how to fall. Concussion, broken bones, etc. 

When those of us who skate at higher levels and teach people skating see your video, we see someone who yes if we were coaching them we absolutely would tell them to stop. If I saw you at a public I might suggest some pivots or one-foot glides. You can find videos of those and try them on your own. If you ever do get a coach, they will have you work on that. You can work on your posture in every move and even off-ice. It took me a year as a kid to getting to try spins, and that year was important for building a strong foundation. Skating is not an instant gratification sport."

I don't want to scare you away from skating, but your spin in the video looks very scary to me. Take it from someone who had to go to the ER from a spin went wrong, spinning can be dangerous. You need work on your edges and finding a center of balance. If you try to spin faster like that, you will fall and badly injure yourself. For me, what happened is I had new skates and couldn't catch my balance like I was used to, so j went flying around out of control. Ice skating is dangerous. And this was a skill I knew how to do well, one that I worked on with my coach. You are not in control in your spin and your posture easily will make you fall, and fall hard. We are trying to help keep you out of the ER, not ""gatekeeping"".

Coaches are expensive, yes, but they can help you figure out when it's safe to begin a new move and teach your the progressions. It's fine to skate forwards and backwards on your own, or even crossovers, and 3 turns, but you need lessons to start jumping and spinning if your goal is to not get hurt."

My younger sisters got to higher levels and j know of so many former 9s and 10s with permanent damage. 

Gymnastics teaches a person discipline and hard work. My coaches were usually not as abusive to me as to my teammates, partially because I listened to them and made corrections, and partially because they didn't care about me as much. It was still tough to listen to the coaches tell at the others, too.

Gymnastics is a good foundational sport. I think up to learning basic flips, it's healthy to do. It teaches you strength, flexibility, body awareness, etc. I think that after compulsories, it's better to do something else.

Her edge and stroke quality was below many other skaters of her era and far below the quality expected today. I'm not sure that she would get full credit for some of her spinning positions,  either.

Her back flip wasn't counted because it was deemed unsafe for competition before Surya was born, and remains to this day. Back flips on ice are not considered a difficult skill, just dangerous. Surya's quad attempts are more impressive to the figure skating community.

However, I didn't feel excluded at all. Maybe it's because I have tutoring and mentoring experience, but the teens took to me fine. Of course, I don't tell my problems to them, and I try to act like a role model, but they got to know me and were confiding in me about their skating fears and personal hopes which was cute. I gave them tips like pretending the audience is wearing ridiculous outfits to get over nerves. Stuff like that.

I've also helped teach LTS and separating by age makes a lot of sense. Toddler age, 1-3 elementary school age groups depending on rink and level, then middle/high school and beyond. Different ages have different challenges and things they find easy. You don't want to be trying to get the 3 yr old to pay attention next to the 30 yr old who's terrified of falling since they're tall.

FigureSkating,fc5z3fk,t3_egd4pm,1577468822.0,"Jumping comes after a lot of the basics. You should be confident on one leg on different edges backwards and forwards before jumps.

This could take you anywhere from a couple months to a year or two or more. 

You can take the Adult tests instead of pre-preliminary if you are at least a certain age (21??). Adult pre-bronze moves in the field may be doable in a year if you get in plenty of practice and learn quickly. You have to do forwards stroking each way around the rink, crossover circles (each foot forwards and backwards), spirals for 4 seconds with back leg to horizontal and both legs straight, edges inside outside both forwards and backwards, and a 3-turn edge pattern. No jumps in moves in the field. After you've passed that, you can keep working on moves in the field for higher levels or take your free skate test. That's when you'd do spins and jumps.
