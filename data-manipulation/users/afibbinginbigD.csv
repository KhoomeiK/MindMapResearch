And Billy and Tommy want to move on from unprecedented success by, hold on, let me check....getting a Super Bowl win with no QB and getting a Super Bowl win by signing at the age of 43 with a new team, respectively.  

But as far as you not knowing, Bellichkek seems to develop players and put them in position to perform their best and make adjustments for different teams and different schemes and even different halves.  It will never happen but it's laughable how us Cowboy fans think that Coach/Owner compatibility is such a high priority on the list of qualifications.  It can't be ignored obviously, but I'd love to see a Cowboys coach who doesn't hesitate to contradict Jerry's stupid post-game press scrum."
