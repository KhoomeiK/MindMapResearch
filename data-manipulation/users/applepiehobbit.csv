Sure, I saw that my grandparents were 'old' people, but to me it felt like they didn't grow older. They felt permanent, like they'd always be around and have the same age. Now that I'm 21 and my grandparents are 84 and 87 I can really see that they're getting older and can't be as active anymore as they used to be. It saddens me and makes me realise that they are not immortal and that they won't always be around.
