What the left is advocating for is to restrict ownership of military-grade assault rifles that are designed for a single purpose: killing enemy combatants.

I’m honestly wondering why it is so important for some people to own a military murder machine. I don’t particularly want to murder people. Do you just want to keep the option open to go on a rampage? Or what is it?

If it is about protecting your house, I still don’t get it. For close quarters is a handgun not sufficient? I mean on a battlefield I imagine you would want to take out the enemy from as far away as is feasible, so a medium range assault rifle is perfect. But...that is it’s purpose. You might have, what, 30-40’ max down a hallway in a house?

I just don’t think it’s worth criticizing his supposed reasoning for doing it. He equates being Buddhist with being a good person. I’m sure there are horrible Buddhists out there — look at the ethnic cleansing in Myanmar for example. However, maybe he used to be a horrible person and the teachings of the Buddha helped him to be a less horrible person. Or maybe he was always a good person, and he is trying to promote his religion. Or maybe he was just in a rush in some strangers car, didn’t want to be caught and arrested as a thief, so he didn’t put much time into thinking about what he wrote.

Helping others makes me feel warm and fuzzy, so I try to do that as much as I can. Because my intentions weren’t 100% altruistic and I got a good feeling from helping someone, does that make me a bad person?

Why do you think we give tax rebates to charity contributions? We want to encourage people to donate to charity. Why do we form an instant bond with our newborn children? So that it feels good to help them.

This is an innate property of being human. Let me answer my own question: If I volunteer at a homeless shelter and I feel good about it, that **does not** make me a bad person. In fact, having felt good about helping probably means I am a decent person. And regardless, I don’t think the folks at the shelter care — they are just happy someone helped out.
