nostalgia,fgjeo12,t1_fgitcu8,1580842455.0,"The bat credit card was Batman and Robin. It always bugs me when people hate on Batman and Robin for the nipples but always forget Forever had them too. 

Which is odd, because Batman Forever is legit my favorite movie... So why do I want people to hate on it!?"
nostalgia,fgjeg39,t3_eyk7ar,1580842325.0,"I had Robin, Two-Face and Batman for years. It was 26 when my mom finally tracked down The Riddler, my favorite character, and completed my collection. Then my 1 year old broke Riddler... But an online friend replaced it and my collection is whole, well used and loved!"

antimeme,fgh40vd,t1_fggju89,1580776173.0,"Technically, yes. Most places that offer branding use medical cauterization equipment, like a doctor would use. They are also very well ventilated places to lessen the smell of burning flesh.

Some places do offer traditional strike brands, but those can be hard for many reasons, like getting the branding iron for the design and the very short time to strike with out causing extreme damage. It's a pretty cool process in all."
horror,fgc60cq,t3_exszy2,1580669499.0,"You may like HorseHead. It's a trippy and gory psych horror about nightmares and repressed memories.

I personally loved the visuals but found the story a bit predictable and heavy handed. But I do think it's worth at least one sit for people into strange horror."
Advice,fgc2kbe,t3_exsmz1,1580668438.0,"If you love your partner, don't leave. I would imagine they love you as well, and it wasn't the intention to hurt you. As a multiple attempt survivor myself, my attempts were usually to try and help people by leaving. I am if course dishing from my pov, and experiences and theirs may be different. If or when, b be due to talk to them. Don't be angry it place blame, just try to reach out and understand.
 It's a selfish thing to do and a terrible way to think. But it is an illness like any other. 

I understand it's hard, gods know I feel terrible for my husband because of the way I feel sometimes.  But as long as your partner never holds themselves hostage over you, or uses their feelings to knowingly manipulate you, you can have a happy, loving and supportive relationship. 

It's your choice in the end, and no one should sway that. I hope everything turns out for the best for both of you. And pm me if you want to talk."

People make that argument with me and my father. He's my dad, so I should love him, he's the only one I have... Blah blah blah. First, he's not the only one, my step dad is a much better option, second I'm not gonna keep putting myself in bad situations because he's a douche that doesn't realize it hurts me, won't let a friend do it and I hold family to high standards. There is no need to stick around with your performed adventure party when there are better options out there!"

suspiciouslyspecific,ffxm0sv,t3_evkiic,1580327862.0,"This happened to me once but with a pineapple. I was house sitting for a friend and they had a pineapple, but it had gone bad. The whole house smelled like pineapple and I craved it more and more. But I was broke, then one day, boom pineapple in front of the door. In a gated community, with people I didn't know or talk to. 

That's also how I learned to not just peel it and eat it like a chicken leg. I had burns on my face like Joker scars for a week."
