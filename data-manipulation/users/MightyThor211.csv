todayilearned,fcwdwj2,t3_ej0umo,1578023168.0,"I am from lancaster and was a freshman in highschool when this happened. The Amish community was beyond rocked yet so forgiving to the man and his family. They refused to speak to the media about it for the most part as to not paint the man and his family in a bad light. It was amazing and insane all at the same time. The amount of people reaching out to the community to aid them with anything and everything was amazing. Random English offering to help them on thier farms so the family's could have time to morn, people offering rides to the hospitals and funerals, fund raiser to help pay for the stuff. It was amazing seeing the English world and Amish world unite in a time of terrible terrible sadness. I know a few former Amish and they will tell you that the kindness of the English after the shooting is why they decided to leave the community after thier rommspringa was finished."

Life came around and i wasent able to play and grind so much. Working my way slowly to get galahand so i could do the VoG. Finally was able to get it after playing here and there. Really excited to finally not get kicked out of VoG for not having galahand. The very next day they nerfed it and gave it to everybody for free. I was so furious I broke the game in half and never looked back."

Doom,fc7phwg,t3_egjx3x,1577515196.0,"Watching it right now. Its bad but its also a lot of fun. A decent zone out B movie. The video game references are fun like a marine shouting ""I am your ultra nightmare!"" And the squad leader carrying a super shotty because fuck you lol. The special effects are true fun B movie badness. Its fast and just the right amount. Its not as bad as a SyFi channel B movie. Would honestly probably be a good amount of fun to watch high. So far enjoying it over all. If you like cheesy B movies then this one should be right in your wheel house."
