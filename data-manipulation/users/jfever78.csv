todayilearned,fgqi8l4,t1_fgppo7o,1581024685.0,If your credit is decent you could look into a loan or debt consolidation with much lower interest. I know people who've done it this way and saved many thousands in interest.
gaming,ffyqw4y,t1_ffxkozl,1580352938.0,"Women of my generation don't really game, but I've definitely noticed that in the younger generation there are tons of female gamers. I've only had one girlfriend who I'd call a legitimate gamer. If you're under 30, there's loads of female gamers out there. You just need to go to public gaming events and keep an eye out for girls who look like gamers or wear gaming clothes. If I was into dating women who were ten years younger or more, I'd have loads of options looking for dates. They are out there, you just gotta put yourself out there too."

movies,fedwy4o,t1_fecwa6g,1579021638.0,"No one downvoting you has any reading comprehension problem, your examples are the literal opposite of a studio taking risks. They're sequels, and not only that, they're sequels to massive franchises. 

One is a bloody Star Wars film and the other is a comic book film in the golden age of these kinds of films. They literally could not make safer financial decisions than that."

I'll get downvoted to hell, but I don't give a shit, I'm drunk and this is not interesting, compelling, entertaining or worth televising. Pure infantile trash that I'm glad Steve eventually distanced himself from because I have gained some respect for him in the years since his sobriety.."

CombatFootage,fe9rdpk,t1_fe6p9os,1578940844.0,"Because the BLU is a 500lb bomb body that isn't deployed from an apache your examples are completely unusable in this situation. They are usually dropped from an F-35, and generally only on stationary targets I believe. They might be used on slow moving targets sometimes, but I haven't seen it done or heard of it being done. I think they use smaller diameter glide bombs for moving targets.

The cannon used here doesn't fire in some wild random spread, it's computer controlled to keep a reasonably tight spread on the target. I didn't see any rounds hit any buildings here, maybe a fence. The risk of collateral damage here was very low and letting these guys go to bury their IEDs would have led to a much higher chance of innocent people getting hurt."
AskReddit,fdrfli8,t3_emqd57,1578683832.0,"Hilti. They're the most expensive tools I've ever bought, and also the cheapest tools I've ever owned. Shit just lasts forever. Some of my Hilti tools are over ten years old and work as good as the day I bought them, and they get used virtually every day. The ten year old batteries even work still, though they don't last as long as they used to, which is to be expected. I'm just shocked that they still work. Also their warranty and service is phenomenal. 

They never fight you on warranty claims, though I've only ever had one and it really shouldn't have been covered under warranty, but they gave me a new screw gun anyway. Their lifetime service agreement also means you never pay more than 40% of purchase price for any work needed."
