I did see a different PT for tight muscles in my neck causing pain and headaches, I don’t know if that is fibro related. She did ultrasound and massage, and gave me exercises and stretches to do."
Fibromyalgia,ffwf60w,t3_evic4x,1580298708.0,"My PT talked with me about some conferences he had been to where they discussed treatment of fibro. Studies have been done recently with functional MRI machines (the ones were you don't have to stay still) where the brain shows activity in the areas of pain control. 

He said they would put a neurotypical person in and poke them with a pin and a small pain flash would show. Then they would put someone in with fibro and their brain would light up showing how much the pain affected them. 

Here’s a link to one article by the US National Institutes of Health. So, there are doctors out there who are realizing that fibro is not made up. I wish the general public knew more about it.

migraine,ffatl6d,t1_ffasgw0,1579744182.0,"She did this thing where I would lay on my back and she would put her hands under my head, where my hairline is and have me completely relax into her hands while her fingers pressed into the muscle. That’s where I hold a lot of tension so it kind of released the knot. She said I could do something similar with two tennis balls in a sock. 

The stretch I do at home is where she would have me turn my head in steps to stretch my neck. Tell me if this doesn’t make sense. 

Start by looking straight ahead then turn your head to the right, then look down like you’re trying to look at your back right pocket and hold that for five seconds. Then back up and turn your head back to the front and then to the left and down, again for five seconds. Then back up and to the front. So each part is an individual movement. I do that five times with both left and right together being one count. 

At first it felt very tight and I couldn’t turn or tip my head very far. As it went on, it’s gotten much better. I’ve started increasing my number of reps. The other day I noticed I could look over my shoulder without the pain I used to have. 

I hope this helps and you get some relief soon."

The therapy gave me exercises to do in addition to the ultrasound and massage she did in the office. It has really helped. My neck and shoulders are so much looser and the daily headaches have almost complete stopped. I’ve only have 3-4 since I stopped seeing her in mid-December. I’m still doing the stretching and exercises on my own, and I can really tell the difference especially when turning my head without pain."

The therapist gave me exercises in addition to doing ultrasound, massage, and e-stim with ice (my preference, it could be heat).

My daily headaches have reduced drastically. I think in the last month and a half (since the PT), I’ve had to take excedrin for a headache, maybe 3 times. It’s been so great.

Turn off your main at the fuse box then at your meter. Turn off or on the fuses for what you want to run and turn the fuse box main back on. Never turn the meter main back on until the power is back and the generator is off. Seems pretty simple to me but you’re right, some people are stupid.

ChronicPain,fdozzv3,t3_emeg6p,1578616761.0,"Do you notice that your headaches are worse at a specific time of day? I’ve had chronic headaches since I was about 11. When I was in high school they seemed to be worse in the morning, so my mom worked with the school and I was able to have no class for first period and come in later. In 10th grade, I missed 72 days of school.  I don’t think I even attend the last four months but it was too late to set up a tutor. We worked with the school so that they sent the work home for me to complete. I was able to pass the year. It got better in college when I could select class times that worked best for me. See if there are options like that for you. Also, there might be an online high school program that you can get into.

You might have chronic headaches and migraines for the rest of your life but chronic doesn’t usually mean every day. Like another commenter said, it just means that they haven’t stopped after a certain amount of time.  One of the worst things about headaches for me is how individual they are, what prevents a headache for some, causes it for another. I know it’s annoying but try to keep a diary and see if you can work out a pattern or trigger so that you can try to prevent or work around them. 

Most of all, don’t despair. I’m not going to say that the headaches and other issues will go away because they might never. But, as you get older and you learn more about your headaches and your body, you will figure out ways to slow or stop them. Don’t give up because life does get better."

So when you tell the doctor you are having a 5 then they say well it’s not too bad because you’re able to continue doing the activities. But, if they were given the same pain, they would be in tears. 

The scale makes it difficult to convey the true feeling of pain. If I tell the doctor I’m in 8 pain, they will say it doesn’t look like it because you’re not exhibiting this, this, or this according to the pain scale. Well, I might be if I haven’t been dealing with this pain for years and have built up a tolerance."
