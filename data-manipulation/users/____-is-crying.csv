ChoosingBeggars,fcnabp5,t3_ei1tzk,1577807275.0,"Can anyone help with a similar situation? I Ordered a very expensive product that was shipped to the house and box came all sorts of ripped open. Product inside looks OK but didn't want to open further in case they won't let me return. I call in and they say they have no refund. So I ask for exchange and they say no to that too, even if damaged.

Are they in the right? Can they seriously refuse return for damaged goods (even if it is just the packaging)? Normally I wouldn't care as long as product is ok, but this was a very expensive item."
