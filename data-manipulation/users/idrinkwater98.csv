unpopularopinion,fdebimm,t1_fddbeqa,1578335406.0,"I get what you are saying however, I agree with OP. I think you still might have to narrow of perspective to truly understand. I use to live in the American equivalent to the ""outbacK"" where we had a moose family living in our backyard. It's commonly said the only thing that really stops a moose is a gun, and you really have to shoot them in right place. People hit them with their cars and they don't go down and we don't even really need to talk about the wolf packs, the grizzly bears or the bison that are the size of a small suv. Alpaca's ain't going to do that job for you- your pet dogs aren't going to do that job for you (even the wolf-hybrid dog I had was kept away from the moose). The real reason we have gun ownership laws that are looser is so people can protect themselves from their own government. The US founders had their government betray them. And the government since has done it more than once.  Being able to defend yourself with life threatening force needs to be on the table for us. People carefully tucked away in their suburbs say that revolutions never happen and the governments don't pose a major threat to their own people. But look at Iran, look at Syria, look at Chile, or half the other countries in south and central America...and you can say they are different from ""us"" but in truth our government is as shaky as theirs were before they fell and revolutions, removal of rights can happen quickly or quietly under cover of darkness without anyone knowing. The Aussie government might be stronger than US's but really things are kind of a shit show over here -and you, not being from here probably have a limited perspective on it -so it might be best to keep that less than incredibly informed opinion to yourself."
