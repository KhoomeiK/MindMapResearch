facepalm,fefy5ww,t1_fefb6uq,1579069164.0,"Hey, thanks for your response. If you don't mind, I'll just paste this from the other comment someone else made. (I can provide you with all of the links if you'd like):

Like I said, I have hundreds of links from different sources/ etc. And it already seems apparent to me that you are going to apply cognitive-bias to all of them and try to find some sort of reason that they are invalid(although I will still do each article 1 by 1 if you'd truly like). The last link should be enough: there are many smart and powerful people that are trying to combat this issue... but the other side(the one that you are defending so adamantly here) is extremely powerful and unarguably the most profitable industry that exists in modern human history. Don't you ever think it's funny that their ""altruism"" has made them extremely rich?
Anyways, the point I would like to make is that vaccinations are unnecessary in the first place when you have a strong population. A lot of people argue that vaccinations are what brought us out of the disease-epidemic of the early 1900s.... as if vaccinations are the only things that are different about how us humans lived & cared for ourselves. The truth is that there has been a dramatic shift in the way that we conduct ourselves as a species in the Western World from the days of Hepatitis B and people don't seem to recognize or bring light to that fact. Before we had knowledge of micro-organisms, we did things like throw our feces into the public streets, not sterilize our medical equipment, treat our food industry like crap(look at the history of raw milk) where we have to actually cook food for it to be safe to be consumed, etc( can go on and on )... to me the idea that vaccinations are the clear reason our life expectancy increased is just absolutely ludicrous. One more question: find me a SINGLE control group study for any vaccinations. Because as you may know: any scientific experiment without a ""control group"" is considered a JOKE within the scientific community. I know a lot of people without any vaccinations... and they are some of the healthiest people I know. That's all for now."
