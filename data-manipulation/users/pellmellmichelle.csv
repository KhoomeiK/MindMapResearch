AmItheAsshole,ffqm1zg,t1_ffq80ip,1580138215.0,"He doesn't, OP just feels bad for the son because the house is chaotic."
AmItheAsshole,ffptemh,t1_ffpr8ly,1580105022.0,"I totally agree. I think, if I had to guess, the perspectives from both people are like this: 


WIFE: 


- Currently pregnant, stressed about first baby and setting up new home 

- In full nesting mode (which is a real thing) 

- Is being promised help from friends/extended family *contingent on having somewhere for them to stay.* It is frankly unreasonable to move away from home for days/weeks/months and assist you in cleaning, cooking and childrearing for free while ALSO asking them to pay for an Airbnb/hotel or sleeping on a couch when you have a 3rd bedroom. That's just silly. C'mon now. 

-  Step-son has been known to be messy and occasionally unkind to stepmom in the past (OP says both in the comments). Wife is hesitant to allow him to bring all his mess/stuff and needs into the home full-time and long-term at the exact same time that they'd be dealing with the new baby AND in the same room that she'd been hoping to use to get help. 

- Step-son also has a room full-time at Mom's house and a job (albeit not a well-paying one). 


- Wife suggests compromise: Room is labeled ""general guest"" room. When guests are not over to help with baby, son can stay in it and use it whenever. Wife does not want him bringing in his whole gaming set up because it's big/ugly, would take up a lot of space, and would provide incentive for him to just hang out there all the time. And also make the room less hospitable to other long-term guests. (Look guys, I have a gamer husband, I know how the computer clutter/giant gaming setups/Cheetos bags can pile up. Especially for a teenager. Don't @ me.) 



OP's: 

- Wants to support his son and make sure he doesn't feel pushed out by the new baby. A good goal to have. 

- Feels guilty over the divorce and his sons current living situation 

- Has let his sons behavior/attitude vis a vis the stepmom slide in the past. But would like to push for better boundaries in the future 

- Is supposedly willing to take on the take on the extra financial and household burdens of having his son living with them. But is missing that there's no such thing as MY money in a marriage, especially with a baby involved. Sorry OP. And if not having that room means no one is coming to help the wife, that's gonna be a WHOLE lotta slack you've gotta make up for. 



POTENTIAL COMPROMISES:

- Continue with current living situation (son at Mom's) until baby is older and guests leave, perhaps 6-8 months. Then either move in with OP or on his own. The son should definitely be saving up his internship $$ while living rent free right now. 

- Dad, mom and son can pool money toward rent for son. He can live cheaply with a roommate like many other 18 year olds and have some independence. He probably doesn't want to live with a screaming newborn anyway, let's be honest. 

- Son can have bedroom 3 full time, baby can sleep in the parent's room for at least the first 6 months to a year until son saves up enough money to live on his own. Guests can have bedroom 2 as needed. 


OP, I know your heart is in the right place, but I think you just need to have conversations with your son, your wife and your son's mom (not at the same time probably) about what they want, what their goals and expectations are, and what compromises can be made moving forward. I feel like you're being a little defensive of your son and that's Ok, your son needs you, but so does your wife. Take a deep breath and try to work it out. You've got this."
AmItheAsshole,ffpfl05,t1_ffpb4dm,1580093822.0,"Yes, but the son can also take the couch or stay in his own room at his Mom's, where he's currently living. I'm not blaming anyone here, I'm just saying, it sounds like a communication breakdown more than an ""evil stepmom"" one."
AmItheAsshole,ffp6z04,t1_ffonpbx,1580087796.0,"Tbf, she has a new baby on the way. She may be hoping that relatives will come to stay for a few weeks/months at a time to help with the newborn, which is not uncommon, and in which case it'd be really helpful for them to have their own room. If the son moves in she won't be able to get that help AND will have a messy teenager who is sometimes mean to her (as OP has stated in the comments) to feed and care for instead. I feel like it's a NAH situation and they need to have a talk about goals and expectations."
AmItheAsshole,ffp6mou,t1_ffor7sm,1580087554.0,"Ooh man, I didn't even think about that. She may be hoping her mom/other relatives may come to help with the new baby for several weeks at a time and have a room to stay in. Now she'd have an admittedly by OP messy and crabby teenager to contend with instead. Yikes."
creepyasterisks,ffp69uj,t1_ffp4lcy,1580087301.0,Oh definitely trolling. One day he's going to look back and cringe at all this.
niceguys,ffp34v1,t1_ffobotk,1580085308.0,I said good day sir. I SAID GOOD DAY!
creepyasterisks,ffp2s0n,t1_ffp20nc,1580085058.0,"Agreed, but also, someone should probably confiscate this kid's keyboard for a few days for forcing us to read that title. Now we all have eye cancer."
