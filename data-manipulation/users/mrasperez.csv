AnthemTheGame,ffnocya,t3_eua643,1580068512.0,"If they are actually overhauling the game, they need to change how the in game market truly works. With the exception of it being a required quest, there is no incentive to bother with the in game vendors. The only store I visit, when I do play, is the seasonal guy and that's because it's the fastest way to grind legendary gear.

Take a page from their own book and do what Mass Effect did. Make manufacturers that have specific traits or equipment they manufacture. Generate brand loyalty that provide special bonuses when multiple pieces of the same make are equipped. Have these vendors sitting in the market.

And while we're at it, there is an established black market in the game plot. USE IT! Make it the rotation store. Have us go to the bar and ask about these under the table offers. Even create a unique currency, ""favors"" or something like that, and have us do tasks/bounties to earn it.

Can you imagine how good it'd feel to walk through a market where multiple shops, that you actually want to visit, was all because you did the necessary work to bring them in? I'd hang around in town more if this was possible. And it really hurts having to spell this out as they have proven to know what they're doing in past works when it comes to this kind of stuff."

worldbuilding,fdazn1i,t3_ekez1t,1578252099.0,"A bit of back story first, before I talk about the most dangerous big bad. Before the Illuse Star System existed there was only Space and Time. Two cosmic lovers who danced and played in the void for at least one eternity. From their love came six children. Darkness, Wind, Water, Earth, Fire, and Light.

And they went along as a happy family. However, at one point Space and Time found themselves counting seven playing together. They asked this new playmate where she came from and who she was. She told them that she woke up with them, but did not remember when she fell asleep or where she came from. She knows many names that she has been called but liked title of ""Life"" the most.

As the children spent time with her they learned new things that they all could do. Including the power to create. Fast forward a bit and they have not only created a star system to play around with, but living organisms as well. Their first children walked the worlds of Throne and Illusia. Given the same potential as their parents, they grew powerful very quickly. Shaping the worlds in their image at a whim.

Space and Time kept their distance but could feel the tension growing between their children and grandchildren. The grandchildren grew restless with their ""cage"" and began to demand a seat besides their parents. Their parents refused and conflict grew from there.

Another jump in time as the War of The Ancients was 20,000 years before the antagonist of this story. He is however, the last living Ancient. The last of the First-Born. The last heir of the gods. He slumbered just before war broke out, imprisoned where he slept. He was awoken to a world shaped not by his kin, but of a lesser people guided by his parents.

He was abandoned. He felt the betrayal that only a forgotten child could feel. And yet he attempted to adapt. Maybe he'd learn what had happened after he went to sleep. Learn what the new worlds were about. For a time he was more an ally of the mortal races. He could still manipulate the world in a way that could ignore the usual rules. He could use water to fuel fires, turn stones into light, but he still found himself greatly hindered.

So his studies began. Following every rumor, every legend. He learned everything he could about his lost legacy. He found the Ancient Armory, the forgotten libraries. Relics of his time that lost their potency. His frustrations grew as he learned just how much their magics were dulled. How the bloodlines dwindled. But then he learned of the Armor of Inheritance. A final treasure of sorts. At the end of the war, before being captured, Ancient smiths of the Ancient Armory created 8 items. When these 8 seemingly benign items were possessed by an Ancient, their power would be amplified beyond those of their parents. They could master more than the elements. They could manipulate all of existence. He could turn back time and stop the war before it begins. He could absorb everything and be the ONLY God in the system. In the universe.

Okay so he starts getting these things. What can be so bad? Well, as he grows in power he also grows emotionally distant with the mortal races. He becomes contemptible of their lives. He envies their existence. Why do they get to live when his entire people were wiped out, regardless of which side they fought? It wasn't fair and he would ""correct"" this. No matter the cost. His search will overturn entire cities, sink nations, burn the lands. Millions will die in the search alone.

The worst part? The protagonist has received a glimpse of this. He sees the Ancient completing the set. He can see the Crystal Shattering cataclysm. And he is torn. If he stops it from happening, his life of conflict, misery, loss, and all the suffering that this cataclysm creates will not happen in the first place. But if he lets it happen, he could finally go home. At least that is what he was told by Life when he finally has a chance to decipher his nightmares. She offers him a third choice. Making things even harder for the protagonist."
