Typically, most drying aids don't have that much longevity when it is exposed to the elements, road grime, etc. You can usually see how steadfast the protection will be, whether through beading or water sheeting. 

What is claimed on the bottle and real life situations are always different for each end user, but it's a matter of testing. See how the water behavior responds without a drying aid/booster, typically after the initial application or first wash, and then see how it responds after X weeks/washes. That should give you a baseline of how long the true basecoat lasts for your application, and for FWIW, Power Lock lasted 4-6 months and Collinite 845 lasted me 3 months. With this knowledge, I went with the average and know to reapply my base coat sealant every season (3 months) to prolong Power Lock or Collinite's application for me.

CVT failures on Maximas are very common. My friend was a service tech for Nissan and he had at least 3 a week just for the Maximas. If you browse the 7th generation Nissan forums, there's a ton of failures, even moreso on the Facebook groups. There's a reason why Nissan extended the CVT warranty on 2009-2010MY Maximas only, but kept the same Jatco transmissions the same from a class action.

I don't know how the 8th generation is fairing (2016+), but I would hope Jatco at least learned a lesson.

The car will practically grenade its own transmission. The newer Jatco transmissions were revised and failures were so common on the newer Altimas for the 4 cylinder models. Regardless, Nissan's pairing of a ~300 HP motor to a low quality transmission is bound to have issues. The early symptoms of transmission failure sounds like a supercharger while accelerating or hits limp mode, your only hope is to change the CVT fluid again and again before it goes 'boom.'

Anyway, when using the backup function on Authy you can register multiple devices and then restrict the account from adding more devices unless you reactivate the function on an already ""registered"" device. For instance, my iPhone X was wiped and I downloaded Authy on my new iPhone 11. Upon logging in, the Authy app informed me I had to reset my account unless I could log in on my iPhone X to add new devices. It takes a while to reset your account too, 48 hour *minimum* wait and you answer some verification questions for that timer to start ticking. Well, resetting your Authy account also means that 2FA codes are also burned unless it is reset by that particular company (e.g. Dropbox, Snapchat, etc.).

Lots of harmonic science behind resonator and exhaust design, stuff like helmholtz resonators are something lots of people do who want the straight piped exhaust.

YouShouldKnow,fdky2pr,t1_fdktwbx,1578513526.0,"Good understanding of concept and terminology. For those who want more in-depth information, Vortex Radar is a great source. I've been running a V1 since I got my driver's permit; it's paid for itself ten fold. I know some people are going to say that I am a habitual speeder, but going through the great state of Texas, small towns thrive through the revenue generation of traffic enforcement. This is coming from someone who is friends with LEOs, and hey guess what, they speed, too, because we're all human.

Now, back to your comment. Radar speed enforcement is not ""360"" in the sense that you are thinking about. For an officer to acquire your speed, their radar enforcement tool (hard mounted into the vehicle or handheld), you have to be coming at the within the same axis, meaning the officer cannot acquire your speed if the equipment used is perpendicular to you. Essentially, the equipment has to be facing you for it to work but it cannot single out your vehicle like laser/LIDAR guns can. This means if you travel in a pack, chances of you being caught by radar are slim unless you are obviously way over the PSL (posted speed limit). Radar enforcement can be used while moving and stationary, and also is togglable. Most officers know that people run a radar detector and it becomes a game; wait until your prey is in a 'kill zone' and turn the radar on and turn it off and speed is acquired.

Laser speed enforcement is a different story. Like you said, laser cannot be used while in motion. And again, can only be acquired if the tool is used in the same axis. The user has to be stationary, and is usually reserved to departments with a larger budget. For one laser gun, you can purchase a lot more radar units and maintain them, too. LIDAR is sensitive and usually used in dense traffic areas, whether urban or vehicles, because you can literally single out vehicles and acquire their speed in seconds. No radar detector will save you from a direct laser hit; if you hear it, you're busted. Now, more expensive detectors have very sensitive sensors to detect laser scatter from an officer scanning across lanes of travel to get another vehicle's speed or reflection of the IR light off a vehicle's reflective surface. That buys you time to slow the heck down and hope you're not prey. The only counter to LIDAR are laser jammers, which are a discussion for another time given the legality of these units.

Not all law enforcement officers can do speed enforcement either, you have to be certified by the department to use this equipment. This certification includes estimating vehicle speed and in some states such as California, an officer can write you a ticket based on visual estimation. For states where visual estimation is not admissible in court, they visually estimate your speed first, then hit you with radar or laser to have a written lock of your speed."
cars,fdhvlgm,t3_el6a2r,1578430944.0,"No, the radar detector will not have any issues nor cause/receive any interference. People have gone as far as placing radar detectors inside seat head cushions to hide it from LEO in states/provinces where they are illegal.
