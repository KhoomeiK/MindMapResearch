My mum's a single parent, I'm an only child, we're both very similar and can be argumentative, so it was kind of a recipe for disaster to begin with, but put that with being poor and living in a really tiny space, it was screaming matches almost every day. 

I think the reason we're so good now is that through all of that, even when we were both being absolutely horrible to each other, I was never in any doubt that she loved me. She also made sure that our relationship was built on trust - I never felt like I had to keep secrets from her about where I was going, what I was doing, who I was with etc. She supported me in making my own decisions, and would never push me to do something I didn't want to do, even if she didn't agree with me. We talk really openly, and I would still usually do what she says not because I have to, but because I trust that she's right! 

Mother/daughter relationships are tough, but I wouldn't change a single thing about what we did, because it's made us so much better out the other side."
