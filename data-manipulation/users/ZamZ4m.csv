I'll always stick by the fact it's my favorite book series, but I wish some things got expanded upon like the Dragon Riders and what they were like before Galbatorix betrayed them. Maybe some short storys about the 13 riders that joined him in his rebellion. He also created several fictional languages that I'd love go get an entire dictionary made of would so learn that version of the elven language."
