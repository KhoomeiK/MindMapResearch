I like having them, I like taking them to the range and practicing their use when I can afford to feed the damn things, and I like the feeling of security I get from the knowledge that should my government one day turn tyrannical, I can at least attempt to say enough is enough.

If I can impart any lesson, it's don't get too excited with a story and end up railroading your players, don't be afraid to ask for a bit of patience, and most importantly of all, remember that the rules are guidelines, not ironclad. It's all about having fun at the end of the day, and if a player wants to do something weird that could be cool, let them try! The DM should have fun too!

That in combination with alcohol can certainly lead to violent behavior. However, emotional abuse is statistically more likely to occur to men than women.
