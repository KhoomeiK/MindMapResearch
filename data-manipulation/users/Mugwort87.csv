At first I was hoping since he was in Philly he put in a special order for the pizzeria. It was pretty well known.    Then I hear the worker mention a helicopter.  At that  point it was unclear Bryant's status.   Thirty minutes later I found out the reality.  So sad, so very sad."

For example he insisted on bringing Teddy every place his parents took him.  Or as many places as  possible.   So  he calls Baltimore MD.  His mother told him Teddy was sent to that city.

At least in the second game they lost it later  I call that an improvement.   Now maybe with more practice, strategizing  and coaching they can sustain a win on the road.   Plus of course rooting for more  wins at home too."
nba,fec917w,t1_feataro,1578968789.0,It certainly sounds frustrating.  I mean especially the last basket in the last seconds of the 7th game.  BTW Jimmy was on the Daily show and he never mentioned the Sixers.  Maybe it was bad blood or an oversight.
