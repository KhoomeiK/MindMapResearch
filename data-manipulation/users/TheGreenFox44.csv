SuicideWatch,fejpixa,t3_epjezf,1579182510.0,"I'm about to lose my home too because of my girlfriend, now ex. I have to go and rent a room to live in for the foreseeable future and live my life as a loner. I don't have anyone to talk to and I have lost everything too. I also have tried to kill myself in the past few weeks and my ex saved me but ultimately didn't care if I died or not. She now tells me to kill myself on a daily basis because she wants me gone so she can go after her new love interests.

 I'm here for you, you're not alone."
SuicideWatch,fejncpd,t3_eph5qz,1579180660.0,"I hung myself a few weeks ago and if I'm being honest it was peaceful. I was unconscious so I was 100% going to die but my now ex girlfriend found me in time and cut me down then I slowly came around to consciousness again.

I wish she didn't find me because life is just too hard and I just want my pain to end. I'm 23 and I don't want to live anymore, I tell myself I'm not suicidal but I know I am and I think I would do it again and that's scary.

I'm afraid to die but I'm even more afraid to live because I know I'll always be in some sort of pain and let down again. But I'm just gonna keep going until I can't."
lonely,fej9qbs,t3_epghwg,1579163101.0,"You're 100% correct, in my experience females have so many potential partners queuing up when single or not.

Where as males don't have many at all, single or not. It's not fair lol"
lonely,fehykca,t1_fehxn9s,1579126465.0,"I suppose it's our turn to be selfish and make ourselves happy. Being selfish doesn't come naturally to me so I'd struggle with it but if I don't be selfish I won't be happy.

Why is your ex happy? Why is my ex happy? Because they only care for themselves and I think we need to be like that too well maybe just a little.

Idk what to do either I try to lie to myself by thinking everything will get better, this pain will be over soon and I'll be happy soon. Something like this will take a long while to get over and I don't particularly want to go though it because the loneliness kills me inside.

So lonely all the time and it's no fun feeling like this day in and day out."
lonely,fehxhbn,t1_fehwrlt,1579125817.0,"I got told that she wanted to work shit out too just to be told that it was only be she felt sorry for me because she had left me in pieces. That day was so hard on me. She left me because she 'loved' someone else after 2 weeks. My whole life, everything I've accomplished in life just taken away by some scumbag that just wants to get his c*ck wet. Can't believe someone that you invest much into can leave you like that, it's hard to comprehend. I still don't understand it fully, maybe she is just a heartless b*tch.

Some people only care about themselves and couldn't care less who they hurt on their journey to happiness."
lonely,fehwlis,t1_fehux16,1579125309.0,"It's hard to see the person you love with someone else especially when you have a child with them. But the hardest thing to deal with is facing the fact that they don't care anymore, that eats me up inside."
