People are upvoting it 95% because of the politics involved and 5% because of what actually happens in the video. Any political content in r/cringe receives an outsized number of upvotes for that reason and I think it's time to finally separate it.

videos,ffibkaz,t1_fffd3nf,1579969961.0,"As someone not from East Asia who has spent some years living in both Korea and Japan, I'll share a non-PC observation here: It is easier to generalise about countries like Korea and Japan because these countries are staunchly monocultural and ethnically homogenous (and proudly, I might add). These are developed societies that have actively decided to keep immigrants and refugees out. There tends to be a lot more uniformity across the board in these societies, especially since conformity is one of the key pillars of Confucian heritage societies. This is in contrast to multicultural societies such as the US, Singapore, Brazil, etc. where it is even more unwieldy to make sweeping generalisations about these cultures as a whole.

Yes, I'm aware of the dangers of generalising and the flaws of stereotyping. However, it is also important to use critical thinking and recognize nuance here, as you say."

videos,ffeyvly,t1_ffdhaea,1579870791.0,"I wish it were that simple. However, my focus is on the cognitive dissonance that many Westerners have about this issue. One of my recurring questions is why many Westerners have decided that it is okay for certain developed countries to close their borders (South Korea, Japan) and ""protect their culture"" whereas others receive immense international condemnation if they decide to be stricter about certain aspects of immigration while still allowing many immigrants and refugees in. 

For example, very few developed countries have jus soli policies. In some cases, it is restricted jus soli but for most developed countries it is jus sanguinis. However, whenever any politicians in the US discuss proposing restrictions to jus soli, the international media goes wild whereas the media is mostly silent about developed countries that are already jus sanguinis. 

For the record, I support multiculturalism and often argue in favor of it with others. However, I recognize that there are significant challenges to maintaining multicultural societies, and these challenges are often overlooked or misunderstood. I also understand the need for controlled immigration and enforcing rules. 

I believe most people in the world have relatively good intentions, but a few bad actors tend to ruin it for others. If a few people are allowed to break the rules, then others will get the idea that breaking rules is okay and eventually the bad actors will take advantage of it. It's a snowball effect and the morality of it tends to become very murky. It leads to a breakdown in a sense of community and trust, which is one of the many challenges that multiculturalism presents (though that I believe can eventually be overcome if certain steps are followed)."

*Edit, after doing some research: Ah, I see now. I've angered some weebs and that is where you and the downvoters are coming from. Fine by me. Listen up weebs: Japan is not whatever your fantasies are. It is a society of human beings with the same amounts of problems and skeletons in the closet as anywhere else. To find those problems, you can't use the same lens you would use when trying to uncover problems in your own Western countries. It will require broadening your knowledge and perspective from outside of your own cultural lens, which can be difficult to grasp if you haven't spent much time living abroad (and isn't guaranteed even if you have; it requires a certain degree of critical thinking and connecting with cultures on a deeper level to truly understand just how human we all are)."

It is a significant and recurring problem in Japanese society that you do not seem to have much knowledge about.

todayilearned,femakdx,t1_fem8p2o,1579246089.0,"I've worked in a total of seven public schools in different parts of Japan and all had similar issues. Far from spotless in my experience, and this was confirmed by most other non-Japanese teachers I knew who worked in other schools there. In Japan, ""hard working"" primarily means *appearing* to work hard. This is why Japan is notorious for long working hours but low productivity. 

Actually, on the sleeping topic, I noticed that both South Korea and Japan were very permissive of students sleeping in class. There are many causes of this which would take too long to explain, but one reason they are allowed is because students are rarely failed in their classes. They are just moved on to the next level regardless of how they performed. This is why schools in Korea and Japan have such high graduation rates, which is another common source of misunderstandings that I see amongst Westerners. Most of their school lives are focused around a couple big standardized tests, so that is mostly what their education system prepares them to do. This is why students in the ""best"" universities in these countries are often strong standardized test takers but may be lacking in many other areas. 

Same goes for people who land cozy jobs after graduating due to the name brand recognition of their alma maters, which carries far more weight in those countries than it does in most Western countries. The university courses generally aren't as demanding in these countries as they are in the West, so apart from a few exceptions, many students are able to slip through and graduate with minimal effort. University is commonly seen as a time to relax in both Korea and Japan. Then the high profile traditional companies in these countries hire students with name brand recognition degrees who did well on a standardized test a few years prior but don't have much else they can do. The new hires then become paper-pushing salarymen/women who spend all their days working long hours to appear busy rather than getting actual work done. All while maintaining the status quo, following ""the rules"" even if they don't make sense, and eventually turning around and using their power to do the same to others once they move higher in the hierarchical ladder because these are all foundational skills they were imbued with from childhood.

That was a tangent and there are many complexities to this of course. However, I hope this encourages people to seek out more informed, alternative views to the usual Western stereotypes about Japanese people that are often very superficial and lacking deeper cultural awareness."

todayilearned,fem6o9s,t1_fem3cu6,1579241659.0,"Come and live in Japan then. Work for a Japanese company, learn the language, and connect with the culture on a deeper level.

todayilearned,fem695c,t1_fem40uc,1579241229.0,"Sorry, but this is a classic misunderstanding. I worked in Japanese schools for a few years. The students mostly push dirt around and try halfheartedly to appear to be busy cleaning. When cleaning bathrooms for instance, they don't use proper cleaning materials such as rubber gloves because there isn't the same conception of germs in East Asia as there is in other parts of the world.

In actuality, the schools are dirtier because of this. In my experience, they were equally dirty when compared with South Korean schools, where students are told to do the same. Schools in Germany, the Czech Republic, the US, and Canada were much cleaner in my experience. This is because they have staff members who clean to a professional standard.

The students also waste about 30+ mins every day learning bad cleaning and work habits, i.e. trying to appear to be busy rather than actually getting things done. Anyone who has worked in corporate Japanese culture can tell you that this ""appearing to be busy rather than actually doing things"" is a fundamental quirk of Japanese work culture that has been cultivated from a young age. That 30 minutes of ""cleaning"" time adds up substantially over the years and should be used for something more important that is related to their education. 

The point of all of this is that we shouldn't attempt to view other cultures through the limited, biased lens of our own cultures. It leads to the usual misunderstandings. As someone who has lived and worked in a number of countries across various continents, I have unfortunately been witness to common cultural misunderstandings such as these so many times that I realize that this is a far bigger and deeper problem than I can ever hope to rectify."

Many of the Europeans with that attitude you speak of believe themselves to be more cosmopolitan and well-traveled than others in the world. However, it is worth pressing them on the issue because what you'll often discover is this: Most of them have never been outside of Europe. If they have been outside, it is usually to a country with colonial ties to their home country or to some typical tourist place like NYC or Thailand. 

They believe Europe to be a conglomeration of all cultures in the world that matter. Amusingly, they also enjoy lecturing Americans about how Europe is more diverse and less racist than the US. Much of this attitude and beliefs about the US are cultivated by narratives in their media, education, and upbringing. I have witnessed exchanges about this multiple times."
