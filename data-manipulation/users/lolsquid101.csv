Jobs that we thought were in the ""human domain"" are being done better by machines all the time now. That callousness is going to backfire on you hard, and a lot faster than you'd think.

We should be overjoyed that we have the technology such that people don't **have** to work menial jobs and can focus that energy on bettering the world in other ways instead.

The issue is that in the busiest parts of the restaurant - where bussers and servers were running glass racks, bus bins, etc. - it turned into trying to dodge a half dozen 5-10 year olds meandering around the walkways with tablets in hand. 

I wouldn't have really cared much if it was just one issue, but the fact that they had the trifecta of messy, making the job needlessly harder, and tipping poorly is what ticked me off."
fuckthesepeople,fd4hifv,t3_ejz1l2,1578167488.0,"For the sake of clarity: 
I was on as a busser at the time (I didn't work the table myself, and was instead scrambling to keep glass racks running to keep up with the bar) so my impression of their tip amount is secondhand. To paraphrase:


>Me: ""that party is the worst - did they at least tip well?""

>Coworker: ""nope""

So I'm afraid I don't have a hard number to give y'all, just the impression of a mediocre tipout"
