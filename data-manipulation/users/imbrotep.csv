carbonsteel,ffhrlbk,t1_ffhjgg5,1579950227.0,"Thank you so much for the reply!  I bought this one: https://www.amazon.com/AUS-ION-Griddle-Australian-Professional-Cookware/dp/B0718SQYK9/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?keywords=aus-ion+crepe&qid=1579949911&sprefix=aus-ion+&sr=8-3. 

My only remaining concern is that the pan is genuine Solidteknics. It came in a green plastic bag with newspaper in a UPS box. The only thing indicating it is actual solidteknics is the hang tag, but that can be put on anything. 

I sent an email yesterday, but have not heard back yet; I figure you’re probably extremely busy."
carbonsteel,ffhr2qt,t1_ffhdk9x,1579949422.0,My concerns are that it’s genuine Aus-Ion and that it’s brand new. I’m not worried about the durability assuming those two concerns are true.

carbonsteel,fffp5ib,t1_fffjyps,1579888765.0,"I’m not concerned about durability. I just want to make sure that: 1) it’s a genuine Aus-Ion pan; and, 2) that it’s brand new. 

If it’s new old stock, that’s perfectly fine. I just want to get some feedback from others who may have purchased these to verify that it’s new and genuine."

carbonsteel,fff2lmt,t1_fff2axz,1579874007.0,"Thank you so much for the reply!

It’s hard to tell about the scratches, but I think they’re in the metal. 

Should I be concerned about the pan being 2.5 years old?

Another bit of worry was the packaging; it came in a tied-off green plastic bag with newspaper, but I’m not aware of their usual packaging."

Not to Make you feel worse, but since he quit it’ll also be nearly impossible for him to get covered by unemployment compensation insurance.  Again, that’s on him."
