depression,fcdhwbl,t3_egzqgq,1577610203.0,Relapsing is the one reminder to us that we can never escape our demons even if we try so hard. I myself oath not to cut again but the moment I've been triggered I snap and relapses and now I'm enjoying it again. I am not being negative here but relapses are normal because healing don't happen in a snap. And we should not force ourself into an oath to stop because the more we restrict ourselves from doing what we want to do every emotions will just compile and suddenly burst and then a lot will happen.
