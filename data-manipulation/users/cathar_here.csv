worldnews,fcy9dzr,t1_fcy8mkr,1578076596.0,"Source, you need a source to know that an American Flag should properly be disposed by burning it?  Our cub scout pack takes in flags from all around our community and we have ceremonies twice a year or more to burn them all.  There's an entire process, etiquette and plan in place to properly do it.

&#x200B;

 The [United States Flag Code](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-105publ225/html/PLAW-105publ225.htm) (4 USC Sec 8 Para (k) Amended 7 July 1976) states: ""*The Flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem of display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning*.""  Burning isn't the only way to dispose of a flag, though.
