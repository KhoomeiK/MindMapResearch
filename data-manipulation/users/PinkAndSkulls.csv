A shop who is involved in the industry and up to date on repair methods will fix it. A shop who has a tech who's been doing body work for 30 years with no CE for new methodology and tools is going to replace it. 

To repair it on the low end could be ~$500. On the high end ~$1000. If you can only find shops that will replace tell them you want an aftermarket cover (if available) as that will cost less than a new oem one."

Cartalk,fcyvcb2,t3_ejleal,1578087880.0,"Here is a video that shows how easy it is to change your air filter: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ywkeM_8Ewnc

The cabin filter is harder because you have to remove the glove box door, but diyable if you're handy: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TK9PwVAUA a mechanic would do this for you, yes. 

Not sure what is not covered under the maintenance plan you have, but some things aren't worth having the dealer do if you're paying out of pocket. Filters, wipers, tires, brakes all immediately come to mind. 

Buying parts directly from a dealer also means you're paying a premium. Dealer buys parts from OEM wholesale and then charges markup on MSRP. You can often find OEM parts online for MSRP and often less."

Toyota likely isn't making that filter. Third party companies get contracted by OEMs to make a lot of the mechanical/electronic components in cars, and they put the respective OEM's stamp on them. Recent example I heard of was from a friend of a friend who works for Bosch, he was talking about how GM gets their park sensors from them."
