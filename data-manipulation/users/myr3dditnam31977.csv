intermittentfasting,ffctynt,t3_esltpj,1579807208.0,Best of luck!  You will do great!
AmItheAsshole,ffa89zm,t3_esbm63,1579729820.0,"NTA.  I have 3 teenage boys and since our district has adopted late start times for middle and high school, I am halfway through my commute to work before they even need to wake up.  Teenagers should not have a problem handling this responsibility."
insaneparents,ff4as2p,t3_erfwha,1579559278.0,"I have 3 teenage boys.  There is always ramen in our house because if I didn’t provide it they would eat me out of house and home!  They also eat fruit, veggies, plenty of meat and protein.  Nothing wrong with ramen for an after school or late night snack...especially cause they usually throw a couple of eggs and some veg in while they are cooking it."
AmItheAsshole,fenzsru,t3_eq0u3t,1579293129.0,NTA.  I’m 42 (F) and have slept with at least one stuffie my entire life.  My boyfriend makes up silly songs about their life story whenever he finds a different one in my bed.
intermittentfasting,feko43y,t1_fekg7gr,1579204093.0,Good luck!!  I think my first day went really well :) yay!!
intermittentfasting,fek7jsy,t3_ep3950,1579194249.0,"Awesome!  I’m really not hungry...lots of water, which I’m always a big eater drinker and two cups of coffee with a splash of heavy whipping cream (doesn’t take me out of ketosis) and I’m good for another hour!  :)

By the way, I’m leaving for a trip to Mexico in 2 1/2 weeks so I’m not sure how well I will do when I’m there, but I hope I can build the habit by The time I leave and then have a little fun!"
intermittentfasting,fejugpq,t1_fejq23a,1579186119.0,"I’m not super hungry anymore, so I powered through the first part :) Countdown to noon!"
intermittentfasting,fejptt4,t3_ep3950,1579182750.0,"I’m just shy of 12 hours in.  Fairly hungry right now!  Usually I make a smoothie before work...so I mad it and put it in an insulated cup for noon, when I break the fast...I’m hoping it’s not gross, have it in the fridge at work now.  Water and coffee to get me through the next 4 hours and 8 minutes.  Haha!! How’s it going for you??"
aww,feilv7o,t3_ep9v5h,1579141571.0,Aww...I had a shepherd that looked so much like yours!  He and my calico were best buds from the day kitty was rescued.  This is adorable!
AmItheAsshole,fehiasb,t3_ep0irq,1579117111.0,Curious if your sister has children?  That would be a huge red flag to me.
intermittentfasting,fehgv3e,t1_fehfidk,1579116268.0,"And I like the 9pm start!  

I’ll be interested to see how my weekends go."
intermittentfasting,fehgpxg,t1_fehfidk,1579116184.0,"I’m working on rebuilding the quad muscle per doctor orders, then running might be possible, but since my knee catches, it’s kind of painful.

But, I’m ok finding other exercise and working the IF process.  Glad to have a partner to go through it!"
intermittentfasting,fehdmm5,t1_fehc95c,1579114382.0,"Maybe being opposites will be good for us!  I ate that way with my ex-husband, which is where a lot of my extra weight came from, I wanted what he was having because it smelled good...frozen pizzas, chips with queso...but my metabolism couldn’t keep up with all that!

And I used to be a runner, but have very bad arthritis is my right knee, doctor told me no more running.  So, exercise bike at home and starting yoga would’ve good!

Anyway, we can do this!  Do you have a set time picked for fasting?"
intermittentfasting,fehbciu,t1_feh9ef2,1579113050.0,"Awesome, I love having accountability!  I’ll start my first fast at 8:00 tonight.  Have Zero on my phone as a reminder.

I’m not much of an evening snacker, my worry is how hungry I am in the mornings, and sitting at my desk all day makes me want to snack!  So...if I can make it til noon, I’ll be thrilled! 

Do you exercise?"
intermittentfasting,feh8qhi,t1_fegwkcb,1579111477.0,"Would love to have a partner to go through this with!  I’m 42(F), working mom of 3 teenage boys, and need an accountability partner!

I’m 5’6, CW 159 GW 130ish.  Planning to start 16:8 tomorrow.  

Let me know if you need a partner!"
AmItheAsshole,feenmf4,t3_eoo84b,1579037401.0,"NTA, your mom is TA.  That is a huge violation of your privacy, cruel parenting and overall crap behavior.  I have a 17(M) child with Asperger’s and anxiety and cannot imagine doing anything to violate his trust.

Is there a teacher or counselor at school that you can bring this to?  Is dad in the picture?

Wishing you all good things and the very best in life.  Maybe that will make up somewhat for having a total crap mom."
intermittentfasting,fecb9wr,t1_fec6v3b,1578970039.0,"Woah...I remember that movie!  I was very young when I saw it, as well."
insaneparents,fdnsx7k,t1_fdm9ear,1578592184.0,"When you drive by a farm that reeks of cow manure and a little voice from the backseat says, “that smells like shit”, I think that’s an appropriate use.  I knew then and there that my son would master the art of appropriately placed curse words.  Just one mom’s opinion.  
On worrying about them getting in trouble at school...My kids have always been super-polite in public and a bit laid back at home.  I have 3 teenage boys and the only trouble anyone has ever gotten into was for T-posing in class and not stopping when asked, because, “I will never stop T-posing”, and “I will never apologize for T-posing”.   Middle school think sheets ask dumb questions!"
aww,fcz8tdb,t3_ejlwpp,1578095988.0,I aspire to do this with my fam!
