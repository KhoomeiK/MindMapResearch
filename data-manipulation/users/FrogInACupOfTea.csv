I will add it to my BuJo right away."
DoctorWhumour,fehpwug,t3_ep3bkd,1579121517.0,I'm going through my very first watch of the show and this post sums up my life very well.

davidtennant,fduq1vc,t3_emzqne,1578737123.0,"Good idea to start a chat!

I don't have a strong opinion after yesterday's episode. As you said, it was mainly a building one : who are the characters, their relationships to each other and of course the tragedy that will be at the heart of the plot.

I believe we now have all the information we need to dive into the rest of the show. I'm very happy with all the cast, they all seem very talented and inhabited their characters already.

We didn't see much of DT for now but when he was there, he stole the show as he always does.

Edit : wording and grammar."
bulletjournal,fdeezsl,t3_ekuaya,1578337580.0,"Love it !

I don't want to wreck your trackers but there is a fifth season of Outlander coming in February :)"
bulletjournal,fcuxche,t1_fcutgyx,1577990417.0,"I like the fact that I can comfortably fit a whole year in it as it has 250 pages. I usually have about 20 pages left at the end of the year.

The paper is a bit thin but I don't draw at all and a bit of ghosting doesn't bother me."

AskWomen,fcdjn1w,t1_fcapjzt,1577610588.0,I am even more concerned that there is no warning whatsoever saying that one has to be a man to like certain movies or play video games. I didn't know I wasn't supposed to like Marvel movies.

AskWomen,fc8mi3j,t3_egniib,1577537966.0,"I was with the friends of my now ex a few years ago. We were talking about films and I said that I was (and still am) a Marvel fan. One guy looked at me genuinely surprised and said : ""but why, that is not a girl movie"".

Sorry, I wasn't aware that a penis is needed to like superheroes movies."
