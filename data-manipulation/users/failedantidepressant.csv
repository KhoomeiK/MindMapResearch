Psychiatrists prescribe medications and diagnose mental health &/or substance abuse disorders. appointments are less that 20 minutes and focused on changing and adjusting medication. Psychiatrist appontments are usually once a month, 2x a month of meds aren‚Äôt working, or every 3 months if you‚Äôre low risk and meds are working. 

Therapist and counselors are essentially the same thing with different degrees. They help you process trauma and work through whatever stressors you have. Appointments range between 45 minutes to an hour and you seem them a a lot more frequently then the psychiatrist. 

Psychologists don‚Äôt prescribe meds but can diagnose mental health conditions, personality disorders, etc. They do psychological evaluations and assess for capacity or competency."

I can tell you that the focus is most likely going to be crisis stabilization‚Äîroughly 3-5 days depending on the situation. You‚Äôll see a psychiatrist once a day every day to discuss medication and any adjustments needed. The meeting with the psychiatrist is fast and they aren‚Äôt going to get too in depth with you. They are assessing your response to the medications. 

You may have a social worker who will work with you on discharge planning and a plan for after care follow up. There will be different psychosocial groups to attend through out the day to develop coping skills and give you tools to manage your mental illness. 

Likely you will be put in hospital gowns for the first 24 hours and then get your regular clothing back so long as it‚Äôs appropriate for the unit (no hoodies, no strings, etc). 

You can go to your local emergency room and disclose that you are having suicidal thoughts and need help. If you‚Äôre combative with staff or uncooperative you risk the chance of being admitted involuntarily. It‚Äôs in your best interest to be a willing participant."
