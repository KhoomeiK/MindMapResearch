todayilearned,ffo6so7,t1_ffnb9s0,1580074714.0,"That is if you operate under the assumption that this is a one company deal.

In theory this is a change that could be made wholesale. There are massive numbers of hours wasted at work based on needing a certain amount of availability and the idea that people just ""should"" work 40 hours.

Your issue is potentially a real one, but one assumption would be that companies would want both half of their company to have meetings together, so for example you'd have a morning and an afternoon crew but both would be required to attend a mid day meeting to discuss things.

It's not that hard to make it impossible for people to take on two jobs. On top of that I'm not so sure that most people if they have a job where they feel they have value, and they make enough money to live comfortably, they'd really choose to spend 20 hours a week on another job just to have more money which they now can't enjoy because they have a lot less free time and are always tired.

Finally I'd also add that, at least in Europe, it hasn't stagnated at 8 hours since in many countries the median work week is now 36 hours and the average work week is probably lower since many people are working part time. The 40 hour work week is really only still the standard in the US."
todayilearned,ffmunwz,t1_ffm8d1t,1580059135.0,Well the current 9 to 5 working system is forcing a lot of people to work 40 hours for a job that often only requires 20 hours of work. I reckon there are a lot of companies who could half the hour of all their workers and double their salaries and end up with better production.

baseball,ffg7dov,t1_ffg0ckp,1579900049.0,"If they start to bean Astros players they're giving them free base runners and get their own players suspended. So they will give the Astros a bigger chance to win the game and hurt their own chances going forward.

politics,fffw4r5,t1_fffn3a8,1579893100.0,"I think a lot of people underestimate how much of their world view is filtered through their upbringing. It's easy to see what the GOP was up to from the outside, much harder if your entire world existed of Republicans.  


An example of this is that for me it has been clear at least since McConnell said in 2008 that his only goal was to make Obama a 1 term President that this was where the GOP was heading. But I can see how it would look very differently to those growing up in a republican household/city/state.   


That being said it is people like you who give me hope. If life long Republicans (no matter their age) finally see the light of day due to what Trump and McConnell are up to the US might be slowly moving back in the right direction. After all if only 5% of those who used to vote (R) permanently shift to (D) that will lead to a seismic shift in the US political system, if it's 10% that's the beginning of the end for the GOP."

Honestly almost every drug has side effects, so having very few should always make one slightly wary, not to mention 91% effectiveness means it's not a primary method of birth control and a secondary measure is almost certainly required (e.g. a condom). A 10% chance to get pregnant each year versus a 1% chance with regular hormonal birth control is really a different magnitude.
