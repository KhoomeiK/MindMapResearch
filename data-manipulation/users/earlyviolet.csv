It's not going to magically make Tamiflu work and not have serious side effects anymore than hopes and prayers are going to cure the flu. Tamiflu just legitimately isn't that effective. It's much better to manage the flu in a hospital with fluids and respiratory supportive care than to throw a Hail Mary of Tamiflu on an already delicate patient.

(Source: am nurse. I would refuse Tamiflu if it were offered to me and  I have counseled friends of mine not to give their children Tamiflu. Their kids are fine because their kids were not hospital admission level sick with the flu. If they had been, I would have encouraged them to have their kids admitted for supportive care in the hospital.)"

science,fgsb9m6,t1_fgs7mc4,1581079260.0,"I mean, I get your interest. And I agree with you that for the sake of knowledge and theory, I'm glad this stuff is being studied.

But for the sake of the discussion at hand, it's not as relevant as you might imagine. Even with the possibility of some greater airborne viability of influenza, for instance, there's no evidence that we need to change our current infection control practices because we don't see massive flu outbreaks inside hospitals when we have patients admitted and being treated using Respiratory Droplet Precautions. So even if there's a moderately prolonged airborne viability of the flu virus, it's already clear right now that it doesn't necessitate putting flu patients in a negative pressure room like we would someone with TB or measles.

I'm still interested in the research. But I doubt - given my current experience right now - that it's going to change our clinical practice much."
MomForAMinute,fgsalc9,t3_f05mor,1581078606.0,"Hey sib, being a high functioning person is a lonely place in life, no matter your origins. It's always going to be tough to find someone who can relate and sympathize with your perspective without a lot of explanation. Even if you had remained close to your family, you would still have this particular problem.

Learn to be happy alone as much as you're able to is the best advice I can give you. Create a logical family for yourself when you find people who can relate, in the absence of your biological family.

And never be hesitant to jump into therapy. I know that can get complicated with being a doctor, but nothing is worth sacrifice your mental health over. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a genius modality in my experience. It's so helpful.

Reach out anytime you need to. Feel free to PM me if you want. I hope the chemo goes well. We're getting a lot better at managing that these days. (I've also gone through my fair share of medical hell and I'm a nurse. So there's lots of thing I ""get"" about your situation.)"
nursing,fgs9t92,t1_fgs8hm0,1581077821.0,"When hemoglobin carries oxygen, the protein changes shape. That's what causes the color difference in oxygenated vs de-ox blood, is my understanding. Very low pH can also denature proteins - change their shape. So the color change was probably denatured (and therefore ineffective) hemoglobin.

There could have been some hemolysis from the low pH as well, I suppose. (Hemolysis classically causes this change in blood color because you suddenly have hemoglobin just floating free in the plasma. No bueno.) But I don't recall this person's K being that elevated, which you'd expect if there were hemolysis.

I get it too. I never experienced visual hallucinations, but instead a strong presence of a persecuting ""entity."" When it went away with meds, I was honestly worried I would misbehave without that ""thing"" around to correct me when I did something wrong.

But then I realized what I had actually realized while I was still acutely psychotic. That thing was really a projection of my own conscience, a part of my own self. So it hasn't gone with the meds, just gone back to manifesting in the way that normal people's conscience does. It's harder to sense, but it's there for what I need.

The same with you now. Everyone ""talks to themselves"" about situations and dilemmas like the one you're having. Some people have stronger imaginations than others, and when you're experiencing psychotic illness, sometimes your brain projects those things and they feel external when they're really not.

So ""talk"" to the person you imagine, get the advice you need. You're talking to a part of yourself and that's not a bad thing.

And I second the notion of seeking a different therapist that you can trust. I had to leave my primary care physician, who I dearly loved, after one really bad interaction that made me realize I'd never be able to trust her to have my back again. My new doc is great and I'm glad I went through the effort of making the switch. It'll be worth it."

I think the airborne transmissibility, particularly of measles and TB, was first identified by epidemiological studies. Essentially discovering cases associated with the same location, but very different times and no direct contact with the infected. Meaning the pathogen remained in the environment for an extended period. I'm sure that's been confirmed by follow up studies, but tbh I don't have links for those. I just know that we know well enough to alter our behavior in the hospital setting based on established mode of transmission.

And the thing is, it doesn't really matter how long 2019-nCoV stays viable in droplets in the air because the droplets don't stay in the air that long. If someone coughs in your face, those viral particles are still viable. If they don't, those viral particles are gonna fall into surfaces where the researchers here are saying it looks like they're not very hardy at all. Not like flu which can stay for days at room temp. Based on direct studies of previous coronaviruses and the flu viruses.

So the number one key to breaking the cycling of transmission in public is going to be religiously washing hands and never ever touching your face with unwashed hands. Ever."

science,fgrd7ts,t1_fgr6pm2,1581043953.0,"You're conflating medical terms in a way that makes it difficult to answer your questions. 2019-nCoV is not transmitted via what we call the ""airborne"" route. It is transmitted by the ""respiratory droplet"" route. We consider these to be very different things in the health care industry. Sure, technically ""respiratory droplets"" travel through the air,but they don't remain suspended in the air the way that truly airborne agents like measles or tuberculosis do. Airborne has a very, very, very specific (and terrifying) connotation in medical science.

The [mechanics of this are studied and relatively understood](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2014/12/01/364749313/ebola-in-the-air-what-science-says-about-how-the-virus-spreads). We're still learning a lot about the [mechanics of sneezed droplets](https://www.nature.com/news/the-snot-spattered-experiments-that-show-how-far-sneezes-really-spread-1.19996), specifically. But coughed droplets mostly enter the air and immediately begin falling toward the ground in an arc approx 1-2 meters from the infected person. That's why direct transmission and surface contamination are the highest concerns with something transmitted via respiratory droplet like 2019-nCoV. Agents that can remain truly airborne like measles can remain infectious in the air for *hours* after an infected person sheds them in the environment."

AskOldPeople,fgq8vge,t3_ezvd9x,1581020033.0,"The change is due to ""criticism"" as in the academic use of the term, meaning to think critically about a topic. Prior to critical analyses of race and gender, it was just assumed that everyone knew what those terms meant and that everyone meant the same thing. It was only when some folks in academia started asking questions about it that we kind of realized collectively that we all definitely did not have the same ideas in our minds when we talked about those things.

The nuances of gender have always existed and are as old as humanity. They were just ignored back when people had much more survival-level problems to deal with like, you know, smallpox and starvation. The 20th century really brought a revolution in survivability giving us freedom to think about higher level stuff like gender.

It's not that different from the change that occurred when humans started living collectively in large cities, which allowed for divisions of labor that provided new outlets for employment and leisure activities. Basically, cities meant that every single person didn't have to farm and hunt for their own food anymore. They could buy those things from a specialist instead, which gave lots of people more time on their hands to develop technology, academics, religions, higher level culture.
