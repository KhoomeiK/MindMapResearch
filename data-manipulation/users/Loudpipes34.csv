bipolar,ff7zxwo,t1_ff7y8qz,1579662401.0,"So I've truly been wondering if I'm feeling so down because I'm taking meds (I spend more time on the mania side) or if it's because the type of meds I'm on (depakote and abilify)?

But it's been a six month depression where all I really want to do is sleep and don't take any joy in anything at all, not even my kids and it's really not like me at all."
bipolar,ff7uodu,t3_es5306,1579658788.0,I'm fairly new to BP. I feel more down than I ever have since starting medication. Are you on meds? Can I ask a couple questions?
