unpopularopinion,fepkto8,t1_fejtf3v,1579323121.0,"It's not meth, but it's basically the closest thing we have to clinical grade meth. Not once did i suggest that it is in any way similar to the rocky gold that is MDMA (i dont classify mdma as a stimulant nor a psychedelic). As far as how comparable it is to meth, I've only had the opportunity to try the latter once but it was indestinguishable to me at least and many of my friends agree. It used to be used for adhd before adderall iirc. Btw, same goes for all other stimulants ive tried besides cocaine (cocaine is not a get shit done drug lol).

I just don't like people demonizing things that appear to be generally safe (or as safe as drugs we prescribe to children ) - such as meth - when really what they are actually demonizing are the trace chemicals it is cut and made with when one gets it on the street.

unpopularopinion,fephsn2,t1_fek3b8q,1579320847.0,"Okay, i see. In that case I agree with you and i think full legalization of compounds increases the safety by regulating chemical composition as well as allowing for honest discussions about dosage and effects of substances."

Plus, cancer is kind of inevitable as your body ages so anything that is said to prevent it is really just lowering the likelihood (and therefore increasing the likelihood of just dying from some other age related disease first)."
unpopularopinion,fejpu5w,t1_feilwb8,1579182758.0,"If you can take it without dying from a single administration then it is safe. Furthermore, there are plenty of chemicals in most people's homes that would kill them right away if injested. If a user wants to ruin their health, than that is their right. You don't go around advocating for a ban on surfing due to the danger of shark attacks which increases with increasing pursuit of the hobby (analogous to increasing doeses or use frequency of a drug). 

Also, if you are referring to the possible additive chemicals in a drug, refer to the chemicals not the drug itself which is an entirely different and independent molecule and could be produced with pharmaceutical grade if it were legal."
unpopularopinion,fejp8l5,t1_feijjoc,1579182274.0,"And to emphasize the safety, that dose is a very low bar. You can go much higher and still be fine just like you can drink a whole bottle of wine and still be fine."

Ergo, it is plenty safe for anyone who has a healthy immune system (it does severely lower your immunity due to dehydration + possible mouth wounds from teeth grinding but this is temporary)."
unpopularopinion,fejoo59,t1_feighqy,1579181802.0,"The stimualnts you listed are also pretty safe if your heart is healthy (aka you can go up stairs) and they arent from the street.

Opioids are safe at controlled doses (except fentanyl since the lethal dose is so low), again, when they arent from the street.

Beasically, any of the drug classe would be safe enough (or safer than it currently is) for recreational use if they were sold in a way that made if difficult for someone to obtain a lethal dose or financially imposible to develop an addiction while still allowing one to experience their recreational effects on special occasions a few times in life. I don't like the demonization of any drug class because I do drugs in a safe way out of intellectual curiosity and it's not right to dictate what one should be allowed to experience in life."
unpopularopinion,fejnyei,t1_fej6jn3,1579181191.0,"Honestly, a stimulant might actually help him (with depression, but the schizophrenia will get worse). The number one reason I cut back on weed is because it makes me lazy and slow and I don't want to be a failure. Idk if that would be a motivator for him though.

The key for me cutting back on my drug use was not quitting. I don't want to quit something I enjoy, just use it in moderation. Idk how you're talking to him about this, but I feel like programs that force people to totally quit substances are actually detrimental for treating addiction and creating healthy habbits as well as sounding antagonistic to the person in question. Maybe try something like ""if you can go 3 months without weed, I'll personally buy you an 1/8th."" In those 3 months he will likely find that he doesn't need weed and that it's not all that special/fun when he does smoke it again."

I fucking love all drugs but this shit does bother me, especially the ""mental health"" justifications. Didn't we decide that the notion that drugs will fix your problems is where the danger lies in the first place? Can't we just admit that when taken responsibly they are fun and pretty much universally safe (yes, even heroin has safe doese and clean methods of production)? Unfortunately, the answer is no and I think the reason is that most of these advocates haven't done enough drugs to reach these conclusions and instead just want to sound edgy and hip in their support of drug ""legalization"" (in quotes because prescribed =/= my desired level of legality).

forexposure,fejdciw,t1_f0w2als,1579168447.0,"Like the other person said, why is this okay for students. I get the necessity of LORs but they are a horrible motivator to just kiss ass instead of actually doing research as an ug for the eperience and joy of it. It incentivizes us to spend more time on something we may never pursue than on our coursework which ought to be of primary importance. It also creates a culture where one feels they are never doing enough. I'm just an undergraduate and I constantly feel guilty for sleeping because I could be working for the sliver of a chance of kissing ass enough to get a good LOR that will get me into a grad school that won't negate my tier 1 bachelor's degree (thereby negating my entire first 22 years of life)... And everyone else is doing the same thing, so how exactly are you supposed to get that ""one of my best students"" checkmark that makes up for your 2 years of depression and bad grades after being sexually assulted by frat boys all the while dealing with family issues and all the other huge life changes an undergraduate faces? Undergraduates are the most vulnerable, powerless, and dismissed group in this whole academia charade (at least those of us who have academia only type degrees - physics here). 

Then there's the whole case of not getting into a good grad school and negating my education entirely. What fascinates me about this sub is that there aren't more undergrads here too.
