education,ffz1ehx,t1_fftauha,1580360850.0,"What people don't seem to realize is that what you're describing is very common, and has consequences. For instance, I have a student whose Reading Comprehension test was read to them by their SpEd teacher in middle school. Now, they are not being read to, so their reading comprehension appears to have gone down by 8 grade levels. Now, in a smart, fair system, that wouldn't in any way impact their current teacher, but of course we know that standardized testing growth is how many of us are assessed, and we can be especially scrutinized if our SpEd population aren't growing. Now, it may have been useful to read the test to the student, and find out that his comprehension of the texts was actually pretty good; however, there was no documentation that the test was read aloud—I just happened to interview the student and find out this information—so how many other students were read to that I don't know about? And what else might the proctor have done to help them along? No one knows. I have great reason to doubt that this student actually scored on grade level with only a reader, considering his severe deficit in vocabulary knowledge when I orally assess him. It could very well be that the teacher just wanted the kid to succeed, or the administrator wanted better numbers for their SpEd population's growth.

Many SpEd accommodations appear to be written lazily or cynically with the apparent intention of making it easier for the student to pass—and not much else. This flies in the face of SpEd's appropriate role, which is to help students to grow and thrive despite their disabilities, with the eventual goal of independence and an exit from the program. But case workers in many cases just want parents and administrators to get off their backs, and that's about it. This isn't mainly their failing, actually, but a failing of the way the system is designed and administered. SpEd staff usually does not have the resources or time necessary to meet even the goals they set themselves, so to avoid breaking the law, accomplishments are manufactured and success is subjective rather than ""SMART."" 

And, of course, when admin and SpEd teachers don't want to go down for something, it's the classroom teacher whose impossible expectations will be called to account."

If you mean that black people on average have less wealth than white people, and therefore attend schools with less funding, of course that is true, but I think that’s distinct from racism. It doesn’t affect poor black students differently than it affects poor white students.

What you said was that schools don’t provide the same education to their white students as they do to their black students. There are countries where that kind of discriminatory behavior happens.
