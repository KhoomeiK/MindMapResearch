You had a neurologist for years and still get migraines, would you change them after one visit?

Like the previous poster said, nobody knows why you have migraines, migraines have many causes and the one session may not even be the reason for the migraines.  

At this point during the next session the therapist will probably try something else, so at least you have that.  If you try a new therapist you will just be starting over."

Parenting,feon80y,t3_eq22la,1579302539.0,"This isn’t how it will always be, just how it seems right now.  Honest work is good work.  Keep being the man and doing what you’re doing.  We can’t all be like you, and you are doing fine.  Actually, better than most if you ask me.

You’re asking the right questions, and are concerned about the relationship with your son.  That’s important.

It’s normal to feel hurt by what you’re experiencing.  Kids are like rubber bands they pull away, but they come back as they get older.

You didn’t go wrong, it’s a natural phase and will pass.  Keep being you and you will see that it will get better.

All sons end up respecting a responsible man.

Also tell your wife to have your back on this.  You are a couple, and the most important thing for a successful life and marriage is ensuring both partners respect the sanctity of marriage and support each other in spite of pressures from in-laws, children and other third parties.  Sounds counterintuitive but to have a strong family you have to support your partner and have their back first, and she has to have yours.

Then you deal with the kids as a team in a unified manner.  Otherwise they naturally divide and conquer you.  This applies to in-laws and other people as well.

Working through marriage issues is also another thing.  Just remind yourself that when you were both young and in your prime the best you could do was each other.  People don’t get more attractive with age.

That was a lot to unpack, hope you feel better.

You’re the man.  

A man works for his family and marriage, and that’s what you’re doing.  It’s honorable.

Respect.

God Bless America!"
