NoStupidQuestions,fgcwbaa,t1_fg9q4lc,1580676805.0,"Most of the complexities have to do with jimmying the tax code for social purposes, usually in a stupid way.  Like the deduction for mortgage interest to make you buy a house. (Why not a credit for first time buyers instead?)  The negative income tax (earned income tax credit.) Childcare credit.

Most people just have wages, some tips and some interest income, and take the standard deduction and credit for each kid.  It's not hard. The tax preparer knows about deductions, but you have to tell him about which apply (he can ask), so he doesn't always do better than you would. However, it cuts down the frustrated fighting between you and your spouse when you do them yourself. 

If you have different kinds of income, the taxes can start getting complicated.  Do you have a business with expenses?  What can be expensed and what has to be depreciated?  What are the cost basis of your divident-reinvested shares?  Do you have capital losses to carry forward?  This rental property--what should depreciation be?

TooAfraidToAsk,fgc5k9a,t1_fg8525o,1580669376.0,"In 1837, Charles Babbage proposed the first design for a mechanical programmable calculator.  Looms were invented that could accomplish complex variable patterns with cams. By 1888, the first mechanical adding machine was created. By 1901, player pianos played variable songs based on the paper scroll you loaded into them.  Complex electrical boards with human operators connected people by telephone.  

By WWII, complex mechanical devices that would encode messages with a code that changed as you rearranged its gears had been developed, and then decoded by a process that goosed the development of information theory.  How best represent complex repetitive calculations so you could process them by machinery?  The US found it easier to work with electrical devices than mechanical ones; it invented the first computer (ENIAC) during WWII.  ENIAC was programmed like an old time telephone system--using a plug board.  It calculated artillary range information, but it was very difficult to manually set up  a calculation.  Its thousands of tubes were prone to burning out. 

Meanwhile, growing businesses started keeping track of thousands of transactions by setting up punched cards and running them through tabulating equipment. (Still in use when I started programming in 1973.)  Cash registers would keep track of the day's sales, and give the store owner a summary at the end of the day instead of just adding up a particular sale. 

In 1948, the first solid state transistor was invented.  A small transistor replaced a much larger tube, used far less power, ran cooler, and did not burn out. You could start making faster, more reliable devices that could handle much longer programs.  By the end of the 50s, John Backus at IBM and Grace Hopper in the US Navy developed Fortran and COBOL. The new languages made it possible to write something in a human-friendly way that could be translated into the equivilent of those plug boards, only longer and more complex. It became possible to train a programmer more rapidly.   
Once the program was written (still a long process), it could be loaded into the computer in minutes. . 

The array of 0/1 state circuitry steadily shrank. You don't need much silicon just to represent one on-off state.  The smaller you got, the less power it took, and the faster it ran (since the current traveled a smaller distance.)  For the last 70 years, technology packing more and more into a smaller and smaller space multiplied the speed and power of computing devices, while we started plugging them together so you could divide processing and have calculations running in parrallel. 

Programming is a lot like taking something complicated, and rewriting it into baby talk.  Everything has to be broken up into single simple steps that a computer can perform. With modern coding languages, some of the complicated frequently used encoding gets turned into ""objects"" that themselves can be customized for particular applications, so the programmer is not always starting from scratch. For example, the code to handle a button you can click is a standard object.  So is a box for entering text. 

But programming still takes longer than people want to wait.  So now, technology has started developing artificial intelligence technology that can be train itself via multiple examples rather than be programmed."

Life is extremely different depending on your wealth in America, but you don't here it as much in speech. While I knew more words than the warehouse workers, we talked the same.
