Conures,ff94mi5,t1_ff56pvh,1579704725.0,"Oh yeah.  Actually, a friend gave me a tip...was worried about it as I have alot of windows.  Friend brought over that shrink plastic that you cover windows with in winter.  Just until wee birb figures out what windows are.  That way they just bounce off the plastic instead of slamming into glass.  So I've been letting her explore those windows and she seems to be figuring it out!  And yes!  I have double doors!  Considering buying a harness too."
