trashy,fehqub4,t3_ep5u47,1579122050.0,What is wrong with this woman. Beyond ridiculous that she still has a show. Seams like there’s a bimonthly racial/sexual/targeted slur from her.

happy,fe8ht1k,t3_enxfl4,1578926308.0,Now that’s a bonnie bunnet! Keep it up. Happy for you. Finding an interest and turning it into a hobbie is sometimes the best thing for depression.

When I’d ask what he’d reply “well, the low fat doughnut of course” When asked how he’d say “easy... just make the hole in the middle bigger” followed by his contagious laughter. 

He was a great man. This reminded me of him."

AskReddit,fbxrxjl,t3_eetf7i,1577198848.0,"When j was around 8 years old I seen the new Gillette advert which had David Beckham shaving his head with a razor on it. That night I decided to sneak into the bathroom while everyone was sleeping and proceeded to shave a giant strip into my head. After noticing how much of a bad idea it had been, I panicked and hid the razor under my brothers pillow. In the morning when I woke up I played dumb and let my mum connect the dots. She found the razor under my little brothers pillow and gave him hell. 

To this day (20 years on) I haven’t confessed to him."
