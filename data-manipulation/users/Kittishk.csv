If there are set feeding times, adjust them to line up better with your sleeping and waking. A cat will often have a high energy period right after eating, then they'll sleep for a while. Use this pattern to your advantage. Talk to your roommate about potentially officially changing ownership of the cat to you, since the cat has clearly chosen you as its human.
