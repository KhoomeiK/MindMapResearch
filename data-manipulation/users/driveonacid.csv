AskWomen,fe4dt58,t1_fe2k515,1578858232.0,"I had a terrible math teacher in 4th-6th grades. I went to a small private school and we had that same trash teacher all three years. When I switched to the public school in 7th grade, I was put in the advanced class because I had the skills. I literally lacked the vocabulary. I had never heard ""cross multiply"" before in my life. I limped by in 7th grade and somehow got myself into advanced math in 8th grade. Thankfully, I had an excellent teacher that year. Thank you, Mrs. Gould, wherever you may be."
AskWomen,fe4d8w2,t3_ennaaj,1578858030.0,"I love math! I used to do extra calculus problems for fun.

With that being said, I also immersed myself in math at a young age. I loved patterns. There was a show on PBS called Square One that was all about math. I would watch it every evening before dinner. 

My mother was an accountant, and while I do not believe that math is something you're born breing either good or bad at, I know that my mother's confidence in math helped but my brother and me be ""good"" at math. 

If you struggle with math, you just need to practice. Go back to where you started to struggle. You may not have a strong sense of how numbers work. You might not really get how algebra works. I know that geometry is still not a strong suit for me. Wherever it is that you started to struggle, go back to that place and start from there. If I ever get to a point in my life where strong geometry skills are needed, I know that I'll just need to practice. I'll also wonder where everything in my life went so wrong."

I'm not a big fan of making threats like that, but they work. My cousin is a doctor. I was having similar issues to yours several years ago. He told me to contact the patient advocate at the hospital and explicitly say, ""If I do not hear back from my doctor in 48 hours, I will be contacting a medical malpractice attorney."" I did that and got a call in less than 24 hours and was in the office, seeing the doctor within 72 hours. It's usually not the doctor's fault that shit gets fucked up.

Quick story: I have a former student who I am very close with. This girl has had a very rough past. Last December, she came to my house to bake Christmas cookies and make ugly sweaters and just have a nice day away from her not so nice family. I warned her to not be offended if Scout didn't love her. Scout had a rough past and doesn't trust people. This little girl says, ""Oh, so she's me but as a dog."" Well, Scout never barked at her and by the end of the day, Scout jumped on her for pets. It made her day. And, when I see her in school now and she's having a rough day, I ask her if she remembers when Scout jumped on her. Brings a smile to her face."
