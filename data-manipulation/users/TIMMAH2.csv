todayilearned,fek5izn,t1_fek4kvp,1579193048.0,"Churchill was concerned with the food situation in the middle of 1944. He had this concern because the Bengal famine largely took place in 1943. As he himself states at the top of his letter, ""at least 700,000"" had already died under his government's watch (actual modern estimates are well over 2 million). People are purporting that Churchill's government was responsible for the famine in Bengal in 1943. This does nothing at all to disprove that notion.

Further, actually read the letter than Churchill wrote. Actually read the content of what he's saying.
 
> His present estimate is that he will require imports of about one million tons this year if he is to hold the situation, and **to meet the needs of the United States and British and Indian troops and of the civil population especially in the great cities.**

And

>I have had much hesitation in asking you to add to the great assistance you are giving us with shipping but a satisfactory situation in India is of such vital importance to the success of our joint plans against the Japanese that I am impelled to ask you to consider a special allocation of ships to carry wheat to India from Australia without reducing the assistance you are now providing for us, **who are at a positive minimum if war efficiency is to be maintained.**

Emphasis mine. He didn't give a shit about the starving tens of millions in Bengal. He wanted food aid to maintain military presence in India to fight the Japanese.

Also, I'm not sure why you're pointing out that Churchill was sending aid but then ignore the part of your OWN quote wherein
