The point would be to have her training in the 2nd movie then go somewhat poorly where at times certain aspects of the force go amazingly (like maybe she just gets saber combat and that mind manipulation thing she does in the first movie) but other aspects are non existent even using advance jedi meditation and training rituals (for instance maybe she can't use force pull/push consistently, and or simply does not understand sensing with the force leaving her relatively blind for a force user)

There are however several forms of sands such as:

Construction sands: - found in riverbeds, beaches, and quarries (used in construction mixed with gravel to form concrete, aggregate, mortar, plaster, asphalt etc.)

Silica Sands: - mined from specific sites where the silica is about 95% pure (used in glass manufacturing, industrial metal molds, water filtration, etc)

High purity quartz: - mined/produced from very rare sites around the world with silica that is 99.99+% pure. (Used in microchips, fine dune sands for golf courses, and horse racing tracks... as you can imagine some of its uses are more frivolous despite its value)"

TheRiseOfSkywalker,femagnt,t1_felfez5,1579245955.0,">In these films the characters are surpassing the precedent set by the originals. In the original films the characters had no precedent, but they were great anyway.

I agree completely.

>The point of these films is to re-establish that message: no precedent is necessary to greatness, it can be achieved by anybody.

I disagree entirely, you might have had a point when TLJ was still the last movie... but thanks to Rise of skywalker we now know that no the point is that if you want to achieve greatness you need the correct lineage otherwise your just some chump with a last name that isn't palpatine, and that's the sad state star wars is currently in.

In truth my opinion is that star wars should be, neither the force/greatness can be achieved by anybody... but also that bloodlines shouldn't dictate natural talent to that degree.  Presumable if Anakin or Luke were not trained in the force they would still be sensitive to the force and might be able to manipulate it in small and feeble ways either knowingly or unknowingly... but ultimate it was their training which unlocked their potential... but again despite their raw talent until they were properly trained they would and should falter against a master of a given field... and this happened to both of them. Yet in Rey's case she's superior to every other trained force user without even being trained... and when she get's even a shred of what could only loosely be called training she becomes the strongest force user to ever exist (except maybe palpatine i guess)... but still her bloodline shouldn't dictate it that much and it does.

>So you're criticizing the inclusion of the central theme of the entire trilogy in the character arc of its main character. Or maybe it's the writers who don't get it.

I'm criticizing Rey because the central theme has been so warped because of her, because all of star wars bends and flexes around a perfect goddess like character and it just doesn't work. Don't get me wrong other characters are bad for similar or differing reasons too... leia's training (or lack there of) as well, but Rey is clearly by far the worst case in the Sequel Trilogy."
TheRiseOfSkywalker,fel8yeh,t1_fel02po,1579216648.0,"Well star wars has always been a scifi fantasy drama in space. Thus the issue isn't so much that a character did something unrealistic or unbelievable in relation to our world, but rather Rey in particular is a character which is unrealistic even to the in canon universe of star wars.

Essentially her character doesn't fit because she's a boiled down power fantasy beloved by the rest of the established cast within minutes of meeting her, or as some refer to the character archetype, a mary sue.

If hypothetically the other two trilogies didn't exist, and this story did not take place within the pre- established star wars universe with established guidelines and ""rules"".  then her character while still a ""mary sue"", could very well fit in that universe because maybe that's just how that universe works.

Essentially it isn't the audience which is the problem but rather the failure of the writers/directors to understand the universe they were working in and their failure to adequately explain how all of the events they wrote, could be plausible given the pre established lore/films."
TheRiseOfSkywalker,fekwn6l,t3_emqfgo,1579209132.0,"I agree, but just to be clear. The concept of Leia being a Jedi master isn't the issue. I actually really like the idea of both Luke and Leia playing a part of training the next generation of jedi after the original trilogy. 

The issue however is the execution. Leia is a jedi now because the plot needs her to be. Rey needs training in the 3rd movie because viewers of the first 2 films noticed she just has advanced power without any prior knowledge or training (also remember the first 2 films take place in less than a week... so she goes from someone who has no idea the force is even real to lifting up hundreds of boulders to save her friends and defeating trained force side users multiple times.) 

None of it is earned because there is no time to earn anything... she just receives it like one would a power up in mario kart.  In retrospect this is one of the largest flaws of the sequel trilogy which compounds all the other issues of the films, making them that much worse."

Then you fast forward to TLJ which takes place over like 2 or 3 days and she's so invested in the resistance and her friends (most of whom she hasn't even met at this point) that she drops her training to save them and saves the day.

In the original trilogy each movie had in series, years between them to allow for character growth both on screen and off screen that justifies a characters actions in the next film. Meanwhile in the sequel trilogy there is just no time for any of this and so characters just gain these bonds because the script says so... characters are connected because they spent hours or even minutes together...

Multiple people,  from multiple generations, and from multiple countries continue to make up stories of your mystical and spiritual accomplishments. So much so in fact centuries later huge swaths of it have to be cut out because the nature of the made up stories conflict, and because they want you to appear as holy/spiritual as possible.

I remember an interview after the first Netflix Witcher trailers when most everyone was nervous that they were going to ruin a beloved story and franchise, with many questioning if Cavil could even pull off the character (I suspect out of fear this would be another man of steel situation).

His response (to what was in my opinion extreme fan vitriol) was that the fans were RIGHT to be concerned and had every right to be emotionally invested into a character/story many fans have loved for at least a decade. He also underscored his own love for the character and his own fears that he would fail to live up to a character he personally loves.

In a day and age where the Media/Hollywood/Directors will openly shit talk the fans of a franchise if they don't agree with them, and will actively persecute them for daring to have an emotional investment in anything, i think Cavill's early response is rather heart warming.

As it is now, i think most fans couldn't picture another actor playing the role."

To be fair though regardless of personal feelings on the quality of acting or the character's writing, Rose was first and foremost a marketing decision by Disney executives after TFA (or she'd be in TFA) because the Chinese market hates black actors. So in order to make finn more appealing to the Chinese market they thought adding an asian love interest would stoke the Chinese market to buy into TLJ and hopefully from there TRoS. 

It didn't, and so the marketing ploy was shelved because Disney is only politically correct when they can use it to sell you something and turn it into a marketing gimmick  . 

Now before someone chews off my head, I actually liked Finn in TFA (the actor is actually great and WAY underutilized in all the movies) and I liked Rose's actress and would have loved to see her in a stronger better written role."

As for why you would boast about it, its essentially an award stating that you are a popular actor/ athlete (or unpopular if your playing a heel/villain role). Its not all that different than the Oscars/Emmys which has been criticized repeatedly for being essentially a popularity contest heavily influenced by big studio money and not necessarily actor skill."
