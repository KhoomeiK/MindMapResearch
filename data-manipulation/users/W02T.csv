Detroit,ff964ww,t1_ff79q3z,1579705748.0,Didn't say that. The infrastructure for cars is the biggest cause of environmental degradation short of animal agriculture.

Detroit,ff78krc,t1_ff5midb,1579643252.0,"This is one of the reasons I decided to abandon my own home town, San Francisco. Forest fires getting more extreme, smothering The City with smoke for weeks on end, sea level rising. The City has taken the lead on Climate Change issues, but will be one of its most visible victims in the near future. Unfortunately, it's Detroit's auto industry that's the leading cause of environmental devastation except for animal agriculture."
Detroit,ff77y10,t1_ff675ra,1579642889.0,"Well, if you're thinking of me as a member of the generation that has caused so much grief for those coming of age, you couldn't be more wrong. Gen-X & couldn't be more ""hip."" Vegan most of my life, never owned a car or house. OK, though, you got me on the motorcycle."

Detroit,ff5er8n,t3_erikak,1579589738.0,"Detroit has almost always been a war zone:

Union vs management

Black vs white

…and it still looks like a war zone for the most part. Add to that lack of viable mass transit.

Yes, Detroit has improved somewhat. And it has some true cultural and sport gems. But, within my lifetime it will never be livable by my definition."

Dairy can have horrible side-effects…

Personally, since I went vegan twenty-eight years ago, I’ve not been sick. This while I work with the public! Before, I did have the usual, annual, cold or flu.

Also, while I am absolutely NOT anti-vax, I don’t get the flu vaccine. It hasn’t seemed necessary."
