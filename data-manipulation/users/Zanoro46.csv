ApplyingToCollege,fdvu2o8,t1_fdvs4ro,1578751506.0,Can they even keep track on commonapp on how many you're applying to
SuicideWatch,fdm4xqq,t3_em2n98,1578539893.0,"Hey there, how you doing? What kind of excitement or fun experience are you seeking fren? I'm sorry to hear that it feels so boring to the point that you're feeling like this low but I'd love to know if there are any suggestions I can offer to relieve the boredom."
SuicideWatch,fdm4qou,t3_em2mbc,1578539756.0,"The ones that bully and mock you are people who don't have your best interests at heart and are insecure themselves. I've been bullied massively from a very young age at school for being extremely extremely tall and I was often devastated because of it but over time, I learned to ignore the voices and ignore the bullies and they eventually just move on with their lives.

Since you said you wanted help, I just want to let you know that by sharing your problems with your closest friends, you would not be ""pushing"" your problems on to them or burdening them with it. Even if they do worry, if they're actually good friends, they'd appreciate it if you did open up to them and allowed them to be there for you. The same applies to your mother. Since you're concerned about how they're going to be affected, I'd imagine they'd rather take on the worry than see you end your life. 

And if all that doesn't work or still make sense, know that I'll be here to be your friend. We can talk about anything you want, okay? <3"
SuicideWatch,fdm45vv,t3_em2vj2,1578539367.0,"Hey there, I'm really sorry you have had to go through this. You deserve better than how your family and friends treated you. If you are still here, I'd love to talk with you if you want to chat about anything!"
SuicideWatch,fdfii12,t1_fdfhpxc,1578362488.0,I am here <3 hey there.
SuicideWatch,fd8w4fg,t3_ekbof0,1578224289.0,"Thank you, I hope so too. I'll keep you updated on the pet situation if you decide to stick around here (I hope u do <3)"
SuicideWatch,fd8vkn5,t1_fd8tf3h,1578224032.0,"I've always wanted to pet one but the ones that live in our neighborhood always seem to run away whenever anyone comes near. They're scared of us hoomans I think. Have considered getting a cat or a dog pet but since I'll be moving soon to a other country, I'm waiting till after the move to make a final call regarding the pet."
SuicideWatch,fd8t70e,t3_ekbof0,1578223124.0,"Hey there. I just wanted to say I like your username. Do you like turtles? Or pets/animals in general? I've been this close to ending it for the last ten years and I've tried and failed twice and if you want to talk about turtles or anything at all, know that I'll be here for you."
SuicideWatch,fd8rfvt,t3_ekbhf5,1578222322.0,"I won't try to convince you not to do it but if you want somebody to talk to for the next few minutes, about absolutely anything in the world, I'll be here. For example, maybe we could exchange duck pictures!!"
SuicideWatch,fd43g5y,t3_ejzi6q,1578164043.0,"There is no one formula on how to be human, in fact there is no formula at all because all of us are human in our own unique ways and no one way is better than the other and you are as much human as the rest of us. If you ever want to talk about your feelings of exhaustion, I'm here anytime you want to!"
SuicideWatch,fcyosx5,t3_ejjybz,1578084064.0,"Also incredible display of empathy to want to give your body to someone else who you feel might want it more. You seem like a wonderful person and if you ever want to talk about what you're going through, I'd love to be your friend and listen in detail."
SuicideWatch,fcyojnn,t3_ejjybz,1578083928.0,12/12/2121 is an even better death date then jussayin <3
SuicideWatch,fcyo0y0,t3_ejh3ub,1578083643.0,"It must be so unimaginably painful to have to go through that and I'm really sorry that you do. Im glad you have people that understand you but I just hope you know that through their understanding, they want you to know they understand your pain and will be there for you and want to help you, and that that understanding shouldn't be misconstrued as wanting or encouraging you to end your life because they wouldn't want that even if their understanding might make it seem like okay "" they understand, so why not?""."
SuicideWatch,fcynfzm,t1_fcyndw3,1578083325.0,Feel like a philosophy subreddit might be more suited to answering this question tho!
SuicideWatch,fcyndw3,t3_ejkctr,1578083295.0,"As this seems more of a philosophical question and less of a seek help post, I think you could look up discussions and debates surrounding nihilism which is a branch of philosophy arguing that there's no point in life. Since you seem to be curious in the philosophical answers, you'll find a lot of discussions and analysis for both sides online under nihilism."
SuicideWatch,fcymq02,t3_ejk9jn,1578082901.0,"I'm so glad you have been able to set a goal for yourself though!! That's absolutely great and it's some progress, no matter how tiny you might think it might be. I really hope you'll be here in a few days to tell me how the PC is coming along and everything!"
SuicideWatch,fcymhc8,t3_ejk9jn,1578082753.0,"The parents part is tricky. I'd advise against speaking to them about your mental health or suicidal tendencies if they make the conversation about them because that's the complete opposite of support and no one, in any circumstance, should make someone feel guilty for feeling this incredible amount of pain instead of offering empathetic support and understanding. I might not be a professional but I'd love to talk with you and be friends if you're interested!"
SuicideWatch,fcylzje,t3_ejk9jn,1578082474.0,"I'll just say that it's perfectly valid to feel lonely and feel alone and that it doesn't mean you don't value or appreciate other people's existence; it just means different people have different emotional needs and yours are a bit higher or that you need a different form of being ""there"" from people. I just want you to know that while I understand your guilt and where it's coming from, it does not make you a bad friend or person for feeling lonely like this."
SuicideWatch,fcyljug,t3_ejka04,1578082241.0,"I'll particularly address your concerns about your mother's emotions without going into what's the right or wrong thing to do here. I will just be blunt and say that there's not much you can do to decrease the hurt or pain of losing ones daughter through suicide and that it will be extremely painful in all circumstances. Nonetheless, it is a very valid emotion to feel and you're showing great courage and empathy by trying to consider your mother's feelings at a time where you must be going through incredibly painful feelings. If you ever want to talk about the scenario in detail or just want someone to chat with, I'd love to talk with you so know that I'm here anytime!"
SuicideWatch,fcykrtl,t3_ejjiij,1578081803.0,Hey there. I'd love to chat with you about anything if you want to and be your friend. I will be rooting for you!
SuicideWatch,fcs4o2y,t3_eimyj9,1577911414.0,I can't even begin to imagine what you're feeling right now. I'm so so sorry that the one person you expected there to be for you isn't trusting you and has devalidated the hurt and pain that you've felt. I just want you to know that just because your mother didn't give you the love and respect that you deserve doesn't mean you're worthless. Life can be unimaginably difficult at times and I'm no one to be telling you that you have to fight through it. I'll just tell you that you do deserve good things in life and I really hope they come your way!
mentalhealth,fcs3wo1,t3_eily54,1577911099.0,"Alternatively, what you can do is what you're doing right now, which is to give him space. I recognize that giving someone space often is equivalent to you feeling helpless that you can't solve the problem or help him but sometimes there really is nothing we can do. Sometimes the space makes it better sometimes it doesn't. I really really hope it works out for the both of you."
mentalhealth,fcs3lhm,t3_eily54,1577910963.0,"I recognize that therapy or professional help is often difficult to convince a partner to seek but it is important to recognize, as you already do, that you aren't trained to handle such things and I would recommend that even if it's a difficult conversation to have, I would try to convince the partner to try out one session. Also, I have deep admiration for your willingness and love for your partner but I just hope that you don't worsen your own mental health in the process of trying to do anything to make his better."
SuicideWatch,fc5gvza,t3_egb11n,1577457249.0,"Hey there. I'd love to talk to you if you want and to be your friend. We can talk about anything you're comfortable with and if you're interested, knock me anytime!"
SuicideWatch,fc5grd6,t3_eg94vs,1577457146.0,"Hey there. Your friends and family have wronged you and if you feel you've no one to talk to, you're wrong because I'd absolutely love to talk with you about anything you're comfortable with and I genuinely mean it. Here's a virtual hug in case it helps!"
SuicideWatch,fc5fenv,t3_egaw07,1577456009.0,"Hey there, just know that it's perfectly valid to feel like this and I'll be rooting for you and hope that one day you reach that top you seek. Onwards and upwards!"
SuicideWatch,fbzg6g7,t3_ef6hcb,1577245605.0,It might not help much but here's a virtual hug for you <3.
