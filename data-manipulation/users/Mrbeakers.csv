WoT,fegrbh4,t3_eowbk6,1579100711.0,"I don't know of any fantasy series as good as WoT but I have to recommend Frank Herbert's Dune series. It is not the fantasy genre strictly speaking, more like sci-fi with some fantasy elements, but it is tied with WoT for my favorite series ever.

Primarily, if you enjoy the Aeil and Aes Sedai (desert soldiers unmatched  by few others and a matriarchal organization trying to control humanity for its own good) then at least read the first book Dune. You'll see many similarities to WoT, but again, it is a sci-fi with fantasy elements not a true fantasy."
WetlanderHumor,feeoskc,t1_feee90z,1579038082.0,"Your ""normal"" sister behavior is from a wetlander viewpoint. Them not marrying Gaul unless he marries both has nothing to do with them still wanting to have sex with eachother, that's your own bias. They simply don't want to lose their closeness because if one marries then she becomes roof mistress and won't be able to be a scout for the maidens. 

I find it funny you think them wanting to have sex with eachother is the reason they won't marry Gaul unless he marries both. I forget which one Gaul actually likes but she says she'll sleep with Gaul whenever, its just if he wants a wife he has to take the both. This implies sex is definitely not the reason and it is because they dont want one to be a roof mistress while the other is a maiden of the spear so he'll have to take them both to keep them together."

WetlanderHumor,fe4atfy,t1_fe48e4o,1578857390.0,"The ceremony joins the two people as though they are siblings. It goes a step further than just best friends, they are induced into a state of trance which ends with them vividly imaging them being born from the same womb. At the end of the ceremony all the emotions they have are the equivalant of having grown up along side the other person. So it matters because it would be like Elayne sleeping with Gawyn, they are that close by the end of the ceremony. They can consciouly realize they are not blood related but they have permanently ingrained emotions that make them see eachother as blood siblings. 

Having them fuck just ignores their emotions solely for the sake of them fucking and undermines the importance of the ceremony. So it's no different than incest (just without the chance for genetic problems)"
WetlanderHumor,fe3cuyv,t1_fe39w4m,1578848130.0,If they treat it exactly the same as written then it will still be just as bad. The whole point of the ceremony is to join the people as close together as blood family. So if they go through the ceremony it would be wrong to have them sexually attracted to each other regardless.
WetlanderHumor,fe34zy5,t1_fe2yejm,1578845981.0,"It's a fun theory but we have never had any evidence or even hints that a soul could be split like that. The closest we get is a two seperate souls becoming one but never one soul becoming different people.

OP's title says a con sammed Capone by getting him to loan him the money then acting like it had fallen through and so he repaid it out of pocket which left him broke and got Capone to feel touched by his honesty so ge gave him $5,000. There was never an actual project, that's the scam."

todayilearned,fdeu677,t1_fdet8do,1578346674.0,"I think you misunderstood me, allow me to clarify. The 50k that Capone loaned the con served no other purpose than to convince Capone the con was ""repaying"" the 50k out of pocket. This allows the con to seem honest as well as use the excuse ""well now that I had to repay you 50k I have no money"". Get it? The con never lost any money, he literally is only using the 50k to make it seem like he was repaying out of pocket. 

I guess I could have clarified but my original ""used the 50,000 for was to convince Capone that he lost all his money. "" was with the hope you would realize no money was actually lost, it's simply the scam the con is using. I didn't mean that the con actually lost 50k, just that the 50k was only used to convince Capone it was coming from the con man's pocket and not the original 50k. I'm not sure how I can clarify this anymore..."
todayilearned,fder0op,t1_fdeqdnt,1578344805.0,"Yes that's the scam... ok here's how it goes down with small numbers. 

Con: ""Hey Capone I've got this good idea for a scam and only need $10""

Capone: ""Ok here you go""

Con: Let's the 10 dollars sit untouched for 2 months and returns it to Capone. ""Sorry Capone the scam didn't work out and I lost the $10 you gave me. But because I  respect you here is $10 out of my own funds and now I am broke""

Capone: ""Wow I am touched by your honesty and that you repaid me, here is $1 to help you out""

Con: to himself ""haha sucker, now I still have my normal funds plus 10% of what you intitially gave me""

dune,fddos61,t3_ekq6ck,1578319834.0,"I think a big aspect of it was Paul's willingness to destroy the spice.

dune,fddk778,t1_fdda7r3,1578315482.0,"I agree with Paul not becoming Muad'Dib if he wasn't being hunted; however, the real key to becoming the Kwisatz Haderach was the spice essence, the poison that Fremen reverend mothers drank and neutralized. I think with just the spice, Paul would have had visions and been able to utilize them to consolidate power but not been the Kwisatz Haderach and able to see into both sides of his ancestry. I think the BG would have definitely controlled Paul if he was only ingesting the spice but if Paul somehow encountered the spice essence he would be uncontrollable. 

Another question though is ""if Paul was allowed to be raised by Leto I and Jessica and eventually consumed the spice essence, would he have been a strong enough person to accept the Golden Path?""

Edit: I realize now I implied in my previous comment that the spice alone was enough to turn into the Kwisatz Haderach, but it was actually the concentrated essence that did it."
dune,fdc8sf3,t1_fdc4jj5,1578269340.0,"Oh I don't disagree that the Golden Path was real and necessary, just that the arguement can be made that because nobody else could see see it thus it may have just been a tyrant using it as an excuse. Again I don't believe that to be the case just that it can be argued. 

One clarification though, to my understanding the crisis was hinted by Leto II to be an Ixian seeker that would target biological life completely on its own, not the warring factions. Though I guess having different factions allowed the Ixians to develop tech unregulated."
Showerthoughts,fdbo0fp,t1_fdbi8qk,1578259301.0,"To the first question, reasons include : stealth characters generally have black suits, evil characters generally have black suits due to association with death, sometimes old writers were just stereotyping, adding the color of the suit before the name is frequently done through out media.

To the second: Comic characters don't think the name refers to skin color but the suit color seeing as most of the time the suit covers all of visible skin, also narrowing down your search field to hundreds of millions of people is not very risky."
dune,fdbkz0h,t1_fdbioyl,1578258386.0,"This is pretty much the question the entire series sets up, and while I think the end justifies the means, Paul was too weak to actually do the right thing. Paul saw the Golden Path but was too weak to sacrifice his humanity and become a tyrant for millennia, so instead he trys to minimize the damage of the Jihad but because it's not the Golden Path the damage done is not for the betterment of humanity, rather it is simply for his revenge. Thus Paul goes from hero to ""villian"" as the series goes on. One can argue though, that without Paul there is no God-Emperor and thus humanity is eventually exterminated. 

But another question I find myself asking is ""does the Golden Path really exist?"" Because only two people, three if you account for Leto's sister (Ganimha?), in the entire series actually know/see it. So while I believe there actually was a crisis that the Golden Path prevents and thus is the best course for humanity, it is still possible no such crisis was guaranteed and undermines Leto's oppresive rule."

dune,fdbe9iw,t1_fdbdmoj,1578256566.0,"Paul was being called Lisan al'gib just walking around the city so I'd disagree.

Even Kynes was shaken by Paul's apparent resemblance to the prophecy."
dune,fdayaci,t1_fdavxjw,1578251722.0,"Hmm I'd be inclined to say Feyd would be married to Alia and Paul to Irulan, or perhaps even Leto I marries Irulan. The Emperor was fearful of the Atreide's so had he allowed them to live he'd want to ensure their loyalty, but he also liked Leto I so maybe he'd marry Irulan off to him. None of this is ""likely"" given what happens in the books, the emperor was too power hungry and wanted nothing to jeopardize his station, so him allowing the Atreides to live makes him a different person, perhaps one who would allow the Atreides to marry into the royal family."

dune,fdas9e6,t1_fdanyq7,1578249447.0,"I don't even think Yueh was hoping to see his wife, he just wanted to make sure she wasn't still suffering. In his mind the favorable outcome was that she'd already been killed. I don't think he was hoping to see her just at the very least that if she was alive, she'd be killed and put out of her misery. He was well aware that any chance of reuniting was non existant given who he was dealing with. 

As to the BG devising a way to control Paul that's a good point, his reason for ingesting the spice essence was because the Fremen reverend mothers could do it thus he had to as well. I wonder though, if Paul grew up as a mentat leader and ingested the spice routinely his visions may have shown him the necessity of ingesting the spice essence. What it comes down to is if the BG could prevent Paul from ingesting the essence they could control him, after he awakens though its game over. 

Another aspect is what would have happened had Alia been born normally and coupled with a Harkonen as the BG intended. Their child would have been the controllable Kwisatz Haderach the BG sought out but what happens if you have two Kwisatz Haderachs at the same time? Though I guess we did see that with Paul and his son though Leto II was something even more."
dune,fdak9ck,t1_fda8vk8,1578246944.0,"I would say if Yueh hadn't betrayed them Paul still would have developed into the Kwisatz Haderach simply from the heavy spice diet of Arrakis and thus Leto II was also an inevitability. I don't think Leto I would have ruled much longer because as you pointed out, the emperor was afraid of the Atreide's growing power. 

Hypothetically, let's say that the emperor allowed Leto I to rule and monoploize the spice. Given the Atreides' character and resourcefulness I believe contact with the Fremen was always inevitable. Leto would have realized the Fremen were an extremely powerful military force and would have tried incorporating them into Atreides society, likely utililzing their belief that Paul was their prophet. All in all I think the Golden path was inevitable unless Paul was prevented from ever coming in contact with the spice. 

All of that said, I don't hate or dislike Yueh, he was an example of the power of love. His love for his wife was so great that the possibility of her being alive and in pain was enough to overcome the Suk conditioning. So while I think Yueh wasn't necessary for the Golden Path I also realize he was a tragic character."
