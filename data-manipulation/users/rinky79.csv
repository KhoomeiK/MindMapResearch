I hate warm lighting in all situations. I don't need the light to be blindingly bright, but I don't want it fucking yellow."

However, your 16yo only has 3 chores?? No wonder she's something of a princess."

oddlysatisfying,fgjdjn7,t3_eypwxm,1580841788.0,The weird blue color is way off from what blueberries would actually color a cheesecake. It should be a much pinker color.

wholesomememes,fgix9eb,t3_eypbg6,1580832865.0,I imagine that's nice.
BetterEveryLoop,fgiwrwl,t3_eyq8ry,1580832592.0,This seems like every soccer play ever.
AmItheAsshole,fgiwp87,t1_fgiw8yi,1580832546.0,"lol, nobody is owed anything for getting married. If they are stupid enough to financially cripple themselves paying for TWO big weddings, they deserve to be financially crippled.

AmItheAsshole,fggz8ab,t3_eyd9ay,1580772921.0,"ESH. She is not wrong for wanting to live in a secure house. You are not wrong for wanting to be able to operate your front door lock.  


If only there were some kind of solution that would allow both of these things to be true...you know, like REPLACING THE GODDAMN DEADBOLT LOCK."

orangetheory,fggyc1n,t3_eydxao,1580772322.0,"I'm not a fan of the back-to-back. I'm skipping Wednesday to be fresher for the 2000m, which will mean I don't have as good of an idea of what speeds to use on the 12-minute run."

orangetheory,fgfrzfm,t3_ey8jcm,1580746286.0,"You need to do a row clinic. And/or watch a bunch of youtube videos. Ask a coach to video you doing a few strokes, possibly, so you have a reference. There is no reason any able-bodied adult of reasonable fitness should not be able to pull 150 watts, so I can absolutely guarantee you that there is something drastically wrong with your form. It's obviously not your fitness level holding you back if you are going 4-6 times per week.

But! Bad form isn't your fault! Rowing is a weird, non-intuitive body movement (I compare it to how awkward a golf swing feels when you're first learning). Nobody rows properly when they first sit down. And if you never get corrected, it doesn't magically fix itself."

I've stuck to the Half Tri for that reason, though. My running has improved a lot but a 5k still takes some time."

Cooking,fgcdbxh,t1_fgccx66,1580671559.0,Roasted toffee-ish sounds about right! I think I might see about finding some Marmite or Vegemite near me. One of the bougie grocery stores ought to have it.

PrequelMemes,fg8mpzf,t3_exg8kr,1580624641.0,"He was harassed because his character sucked both in the writing and the acting. She was harassed because she's female and Asian. Although neither deserved harassment on a personal level (as opposed to professional criticism), her experience was pretty clearly different."
AmItheAsshole,fg82pz3,t1_fg81pin,1580607944.0,"Maybe they're referring to the label required in California that says basically ""this product may expose you to a chemical known to cause cancer or birth defect.""
Pretty much anything electronic sold in California has the label, even though the relevant chemicals (frequently lead) are usually inside the plastic body of whatever the product is and exposure is negligible. I've never heard of anyone thinking they need to wash their hands after using a laptop charger!
