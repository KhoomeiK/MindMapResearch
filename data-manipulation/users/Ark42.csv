TheSilphRoad,ffe1ir0,t3_et3z21,1579834275.0,"I've always had this problem, sorta. Most spins give me berries and potions and 0 balls, quite often. Gyms are just a jackpot of like 4 revives, 3 potions, and 1 ball most of the time. But I'm in Tokyo, so I spin so many stops I still discard 100% of my regular Pokeballs in the end. Not to mention every single regular revive and non-Max potion."

TheSilphRoad,ffdizpx,t1_ffde4h5,1579821877.0,"Fine, it's just words. Call it a mistake. At the end of the day, the right thing to do is STILL compensate people with virtual items that cost the company nothing. But they won't even do that.

Did you actually get an email address you can reach them at? I don't have a Twitter account, so I doubt creating a new one just to tweet at them would get me anywhere."
TheSilphRoad,ffdisos,t1_ffdfbl8,1579821760.0,"Yeah, please feel free to deduct whatever those were. I know I auto-transferred everything I hatched. I won't really care of my stardust drops by a little and my Grimer candy goes from 2,500 to 2,400 or whatever. I'd rather have the actual CHANCE to get a shiny Vulpix from that task instead."
TheSilphRoad,ffddp0f,t1_ffdd8e1,1579818708.0,"The lie was ""you can get a shiny Vulpix from this task"". Since it was bugged, and you could not get a shiny from it, I think it's fair to call that a lie as well.

Just out of curiosity, what email address did you email for their support? The one listed on the Google Play page just auto-replies saying that they do NOT handle support via email and you must contact them in-game. The in-game support has ignored my messages for over a week now with no reply at all (probably because I asked a third time for incubators as compensation after they said no twice and closed the chat the first two times.) Kinda sucks if I ever need help with a different thing now, since I guess I'm banned from their in-game support now."
TheSilphRoad,ffd5d6p,t3_esy5ik,1579813739.0,Now if only they'd give the rest of us compensation for wasting all our incubators on their lie the first time around.

TheSilphRoad,ffalvpw,t1_ffai12p,1579739002.0,Well perhaps you're misunderstanding what I said then. I'm certainly not spamming them. I asked merely for compensation and then asked again and attached a screenshot of posts from TSR and other support chats where they did give the same compensation to people.
TheSilphRoad,ffadnov,t1_ffaahmc,1579733106.0,I don't know. Somehow I doubt Japan has the level of consumer protection most EU countries seem to have.

TheSilphRoad,ff7lp4r,t1_ff7l17x,1579652534.0,"I asked a handful of times for compensation for the Vulpix task issue, since other people got incubators as compensation. Other people received that, and it costs Niantic nothing since it's just virtual items. I wasted quite a few incubators on the lie of trying to get a shiny from that task."
TheSilphRoad,ff7kdsc,t1_ff7hwe3,1579651620.0,"I refunded my most recent Google Play transaction, so now I have a ton of negative coins thanks to Niantic's pettyness. Unfortunately, when the support WAS responding to my message, they had the audacity to tell me that *Google* was the one that subtracted the PokeCoins from my Pokemon Go account.  They really think we're stupid, don't they?

Well, now I'm certainly never spending money again, because all it would do is cancel out the debt and bring me to zero.  Way to go HelpShift, now you've not only lost money for Niantic, but you've lost a future customer as well."
TheSilphRoad,ff7k211,t1_ff7ilih,1579651394.0,"I've asked and they said because I didn't purchase the COINS during a specific window, that I can't get any incubators as compensations."

TheSilphRoad,ff7fxer,t1_ff7cz3s,1579648635.0,I wasted a ton of incubators on the Vulpix quest and they refuse to even compensate me a single virtual item still. Now their in-game support actually actively ignores all my messages.
TheSilphRoad,ff5kv9q,t3_ern578,1579597769.0,I've seen a few Roggenrola on my nearby in Tokyo. I've never seen a regular geodude outside of a few events here.
todayilearned,ff2dlsh,t1_ff1u0vm,1579501838.0,"I'm amazed at how much infrastructure Japan has for blind people, but at the same time, has basically nothing for wheelchairs. It's the total opposite of America where every building has to have a ramp and elevators have to be certain sizes and the doors stay open such a minimum time, etc. In most places (especially outside of Tokyo) you're just out of luck if you're in a chair, I guess."
TheSilphRoad,ff2ct1h,t1_ff20gjh,1579501001.0,"If you're waiting 31 minutes between actions to get to excited as fast as possible, then it's _probably_ been somewhere just over 60 minutes when you can get a heart from the feeding action again, so yeah, what I originally said. First berry gets you to almost full, 2nd to full but still shows the red circle around the face at the top of the screen. The 3rd berry will make that red circle disappear and trigger the light and hearts.

That's not to say that sometimes 2 doesn't work, because I'm pretty sure it does. Like most things in this game, it's pretty buggy."
TheSilphRoad,ff0x9ew,t1_ff0u5xp,1579473186.0,"Keep in mind that you often still have to give 3 berries to get the heart to happen. The first one brings it to like 95% full, the second one just stops at 100%, and the 3rd one makes the red outer ring disappear and triggers the flash of light and hearts from your buddy."
japanlife,fext775,t3_eqovdp,1579435616.0,"I'm from America, and I lived in the inaka of Mie for 3 years, and now Tokyo for 2. Personally, I have noticed significantly more dust, but only in Tokyo. I did not have this problem in Mie, so I don't think it's all of Japan."
NianticWayfarer,fexm07m,t1_fex7pqe,1579433187.0,"Haha, yeah I guess the problem is two-fold. Tokyo is so full of people who are able to submit, but at the same time, yeah, a lot less people probably even know about wayfarer.

But regardless of all that, ""upgrades"" are supposed to be a reward for reviewing, but given the way they (don't) work for me, I've lost all incentive to do this free work for Niantic.  Maybe it's not a problem in Niantic's eyes since there are still lots of POIs here (Tokyo in general) compared to other countries, but honestly, there are not that many POIs here (my local station way out on a commuter line) compared to lots of other places."
NianticWayfarer,feqgzik,t1_fep8z3n,1579341777.0,"I'm on the western edge of Tokyo proper. I'm pretty sure bonus location aside, there are potentially tons of reviewers here. Not only is Ingress still super popular in Japan, but Pokemon Go is as well. Although I guess I wouldn't really be surprised if a lot less people even know about wayfarer here as compared to in the states."
NianticWayfarer,fep1dmy,t3_epvvlv,1579309961.0,"I have stuff from 2 months ago. My very first nomination and several others. Ton of them all just sitting ""in queue"" ""upgraded"" and nothing is happening anymore."
NianticWayfarer,fep12b9,t3_epwq8c,1579309763.0,"My very first nomination, which was also my first upgrade, has been ""in queue"" for over 2 months now. I got everything else I submitted ""upgraded"" as well and nothing of mine has gone to voting in several weeks. I long ago stopped reviewing because there's no more further gains to be made for my submissions now."
todayilearned,femelso,t1_fem36bd,1579251471.0,"Yeah, and even for the regular local trains, those suck big time. That's why there are ped tunnels and bridges all over the place. Even in fairly rural areas."
todayilearned,fem1qp8,t1_felo7xq,1579236920.0,You don't really want to put crossings with roads on a line that has trains zipping by literally every 5 minutes.
todayilearned,fem1drx,t1_felqwku,1579236605.0,"There's still some difference in here somewhere though. As an American living in Tokyo, I fly when I go to Hokkaido.. why?  It's probably faster and/or slightly cheaper, but the real reason I think it works here is that domestic flights are super convenient. You can take local trains to the airport, and you can get into the airport terminal by scanning a QR code. Security lines for domestic flights are about 2-3 minutes every time I've gone anywhere, and overall the flights here run about as smooth as the trains do. Flying the same kind of distance in America means driving into the heart of a big city, finding a spot in the long-term parking lot, paying a huge fee just to leave your car there, and then waiting in a 2 hour security line. At least, that's how it is every time I used to go between Detroit and Florida. And once you get to the other side, rent a car I guess? It's the intermixing between trains and airports that really makes it work here. Just because it's cheaper/quicker to do a long haul from Tokyo to Hokkaido via air doesn't mean you DON'T build a bunch of train lines that COULD take you along the same route. Tons of people probably use each and every segment of that route I could have taken, every single day."
TheSilphRoad,feg7aoi,t3_eozvdo,1579080381.0,"Honestly, I started playing Pokemon Go specifically because it was the type of game that didn't have or need PvP. Gyms were (and still kinda are) one of the poorest designed aspects of the game which for me was basically a glorified Geocaching game with cute graphics. Not only is the PvP in Pokemon Go just boring (tap tap tap tap) but I didn't even WANT such a feature to begin with, so other than doing it against somebody's team of CP10 mons to get a sinnoh stone back when I needed those, I view it just like the AR camera and Smeagle features. More of a chore and not something that's fun about the game."
TheSilphRoad,fefrfq9,t3_eops8l,1579063028.0,"Somebody put 4x ice lures down near me, and I kept seeing Tympole over and over. It's not exactly rare normally, but it really made me think it was partly because of the ice lure."
TheSilphRoad,fef1q8c,t1_feevm8s,1579046120.0,"10 seconds is about right. I've played community days in the Sunshine mall where this is, and the spawns and lures are amazing, but the 2 gyms for the Pokemon Center are both under attack 24/7 by 20+ people and you can't even hope to get a single coin there."
TheSilphRoad,fef1l02,t1_feenmml,1579046022.0,"Uhg, youtubers are insufferable enough as it is, but yes, there was a live-streamer there doing a raid when Lugia/Ho-oh was back for the weekend recently. They had their phone connected to a big TV on the wall behind that gym circular TV, and they were screaming about how they were going to throw the ball or something. Didn't even circle-set or anything, completely missed half their throws. So painful to watch."
TheSilphRoad,fef1b87,t3_eorhpl,1579045840.0,"I live right around here, and while this thing is neat, it looks doomed. This is prime space in a huge shopping center, and I can't see them pulling in any money from this shop. They do sell team t-shirts and hats, and some box that looks like the Pokemon Go gifts but with 10 tiny little candies inside, despite being pretty a big looking box. But nobody is buying anything. Nobody is forming a line to spend any money here. They don't even sell Go+ or batteries or anything that I could see. The space is used for trading I guess, as well as showing the gym colors on lights around the store, but nobody is going to spend 1,000,000 dust to trade a shiny or lake trio here, they're going to have to pre-arrange it 30+ days in advance with somebody (find us on the local discord at https://discord.gg/rzUCJYF ). So I just don't see the purpose to this store really.

They also opened a Pokemon TCG store and a Pikachu Sweets store, and all 3 of these new stores are right next to the existing Pokemon Center Megatokyo. Of course the TCG store is selling cards, hosting tournaments, and other things that will bring in money, and the new sweets store has a line that looks 2 hours long just to get ice cream or tea. Now when you compare the Pokemon Go Lab to those 2, it just seems even more doomed. I don't think they'll keep that space open just for the fun of it, to be honest."
TheSilphRoad,fef0rjb,t1_feeveo4,1579045482.0,"API is very broad and generic. We could say it is very reasonable to have Niantic offer a read-only API, where you can get information about things. Which is very different that the game API used to move around, catch things, spin things, etc."
TheSilphRoad,febs664,t1_fe7vbu8,1578962072.0,"No, they probably don't do anything, but it just indicates that the RNG used to select which gift your buddy is about to bring you is kinda crummy if it keeps picking the same number. I'm not sure how many different choices there are in the pool, but I wouldn't expect that out of 7 times I'd only get 3 unique items."
TheSilphRoad,fe7q8y0,t3_eo27fb,1578917886.0,"I have 3 torn tickets, 2 mushrooms, and 2 tropical flowers. I haven't changed buddies since the new system started. Really crummy RNG I think, for my Lucario to keep giving me the same 3 things."
TheSilphRoad,fe6dgri,t1_fe5srd4,1578887694.0,"Apple doesn't tell the game dev who did the refund. Much better policy than Google for times like this when the game dev is clearly at fault.  I use Android exclusively, but this makes me want to get an old iPhone and buy some coins on my Pokemon Go account and then get a refund, because getting a refund through Google is NOT actually a refund, it's just a loan where all you can do is pay it back to end up at zero again with no compensation for game bugs that lead to wasted items."

TheSilphRoad,fdzvytk,t1_fdzqkxh,1578797102.0,"In general, the culture of Japan is that nobody even returns anything, ever, so I wouldn't be surprised if there just aren't any laws here. All sales are final. If a physical product is clearly broken out of the box and you bring it back the same day, I'm sure you can get a replacement, but a refund would be out of the question."
TheSilphRoad,fdzogjx,t1_fdzet2k,1578792445.0,"How did you even contact Google? When I use any of the options for orders from a week ago, I *immediately* get a auto-reply email saying it's been denied."
TheSilphRoad,fdzc3bh,t1_fdyjx8y,1578788669.0,I got this canned reply too. I tried a refund from Google but it's automatically denied since it's been >48 hours since the purchase.
TheSilphRoad,fdz0vup,t1_fdrky9n,1578785540.0,I just get auto-replies since it's over 48 hours. Literally NOTHING you can do on the Google page does anything different. The ONLY way to get any refund at all would be within 48 hours..

TheSilphRoad,fdqb8iw,t1_fdq8km8,1578661855.0,"No, you start at 2 EP and the first two faces are never shown in the game right now. Maybe they are planning some other feature where your buddy can actually become unhappy via some other means, I dunno."
TheSilphRoad,fdqb0p2,t1_fdq7uvt,1578661657.0,"Well if you're not spending money on poffins, you're probably not spending money on raid passes either. Given gym coins (maybe) and a good box, you might be able to average 2 raids per day with the free pass, which even sticking to level 5 raids might get you 0, or maybe 3 rare candy per day. Sometimes more, but not often. For F2P who want to grind it out, the buddy system probably gets your more candy than raids do. Yes, it's a lot more work and a lot of things are set up poorly, but you can get more candy out of it on average, if you don't mind walking all day."
TheSilphRoad,fdqautn,t1_fdq8ljm,1578661508.0,"Yeah, it's really kinda dumb isn't it."
TheSilphRoad,fdq5b94,t1_fdq2pl6,1578655510.0,"Yeah you can do that. If you're playing naturally and doing lots of various things, it's fine, you'll keep resetting the decay timer.

TheSilphRoad,fdq59b2,t1_fdq15dr,1578655440.0,"I strongly suspect there is a cap, because I know the easy 4 EP (photo, pet, feed, leader battle) I tend to do every 31 minutes. I've been at 31 EP, done 1 of those actions, saw the face change to excited, did the other 3 actions, then closed the game and walked with just AS for an hour. At best I should have lost 2 EP, and if I was at 35 EP before walking, I'd be at 33 EP now, but when I open the game again, my buddy is not excited anymore, and it takes more than 1 action to get back to excited. It makes me guess that EP is capped at 32."
TheSilphRoad,fdq54ig,t1_fdq4ybg,1578655268.0,"No, it opens up a 2nd row of slots, but you also earn them at 2x the rate, so if you walked 2km and had 1 heart in the 3 for ""Walk together"", then later got your buddy excited, and walked another 2km, you'd have 3 hearts filled in, but it's the ""regular"" 3 slots first, and 3 more bonus slots on top of that, which are still empty.

TheSilphRoad,fdq51dg,t1_fdq4vd8,1578655156.0,"This is strange, because I've done several battles before trying to get to 8 EP and it didn't work.

Technically the :| face is for 2-3 EP, not 1, because the other states are for 0 points and 1 point, respectively, but they're not possible to see in the game right now."

I've tested battles and can't get any to overlap at all. First thing in the morning, berry, pet, photo, pvp usually gets you to 6 points, but if you have a gift from the previous day, you can go directly to 9. I tried skipping pet and photo so I'd be at 7 after berry, gift, and pvp, then I did a grunt battle and didn't go to 8. Took a photo and then it went to 8."

It's not hard if you write down the times you did actions in a notepad app, and do something quickly in between intervals of 31 minutes so reset the decay timer.  Granted, with just 4 points every 31 minutes, it takes about 4 hours to get there, but usually I can spin gyms or get the first 2km walking +3 emotion points thing to get it down to only about 3 hours. For me, this happens from the time I get up, get ready around my home, and ride the train to work. By the time I'm at work it's usually excited already and I can easily maintain that the whole day. This way, when I walk around at lunch or after work, I'm already getting candy at 2x the normal rate."

For petting and feeding, it's basically instant, but for taking a photo, you don't get the emotion point or heart until you exit the buddy screen and it shows your the summary of the photos you took. For leader battles, yeah, as soon as you start the battle it triggers. You can immediately run away, especially if you already did one and got your 500 dust from it earlier."

This is the biggest problem with ward-level laws. The city/ward employees have to be enforcers. From what I've heard, since the smoking law is a Tokyo-prefecture-level law, the police can enforce it, and if you want to force them into filing a report, you have every right to call the police over to a restaurant and make them act.   If this is all actually true, I really, seriously, hope that Tokyo passes a whole-prefecture smoking ban for sidewalks and other public spaces."

You're overestimating the percentage of people who smoke in Japan. Sure, it USED to be like 60% (of adults, not of the population) but that has fallen *every single year* since the peak back in the 1950s or 60s, and it's in the 10-15% range now.  If anything, the increase in traffic from non-smokers who have been avoiding lots of certain places until now might actually HELP some businesses."
