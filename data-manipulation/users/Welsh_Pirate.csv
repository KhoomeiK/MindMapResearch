AskReddit,ffjk924,t1_ffivvue,1580000135.0,">Actually, he was meant to die in season 2 of the show. It wasn’t a decision made for the film specifically.

Source? I've always seen Joss Whedon say that he made the decision to kill off Wash because Alan Tudyk's career was starting to take off, and Joss didn't want him turning down good roles waiting for a sequel or series revival that probably wasn't going to happen.

I'm pretty sure he's also said that if he had his way, Wash and Zoe would be the one couple safe, because he was going to complicate their lives with a baby. Which is foreshadowed with their conversation about just such a complication in ""Heart of Gold""."

Having said that, nothing she did was justified. The most she should have done was ask them politely to leave at least once, and then call the cops if anyone wasn't complying. Yelling and raging was unnecessary, and starting a physical altercation was entirely uncalled for."

AskReddit,felpcn7,t1_felinef,1579227672.0,"I think you're still underestimating the scope. For instance, *Stanger Things* has about 8 episodes a season.

Quite a bit if screen time is taken by adult characters like Joyce and Hopper, or 20 year olds playing teens, like Nancy/Johnathan/Steve.

So they'd need to do twice the shooting per episode, with more episodes, and a third less time to do it? That's an unreasonable amount of pressure to put on some 11 year olds."

*1. They straight up adapt the Corwin saga, and drop the Merlin saga entirely.

*2. Start with Merlin. Allow the writers leeway to not have to stick to the books too religiously so they are free to form a complete story. Occasionally reference events from the Corwin saga as backstory.

*3. Condense the Corwin saga in to a movie trilogy, then do the Merlin centric show as a spin-off."
