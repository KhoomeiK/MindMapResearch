For instance, if you give 50% of your mass to another player by moving DIRECTLY into them, you would have 0.5 of your mass \* 180 degrees logged as mass given to a player, whereas if you're moving exactly away from the player that ate you, it would be 0.5 \* 0 degrees.

truegaming,fe9s90d,t3_eo5xv5,1578940993.0,"Ii haven't done much in the way of cooperative games like Overwatch, but Agario's team mode can definitely work this way and it's one reason I tend to avoid it. Agario's TM is frequented by clingers - small players with barely any mass that can nonetheless slow down larger players if they happen to be in the way. If the large player is being chased by a larger opposing player, this means instant death, and in fact there are cross-teamers (two people that ignore their own teams and simply play with each other) that utilize these tactics to force their own real teammates to die to the buddy they've teamed up with. Additionally, a bad (but honest) mistake on the side of one person often leads to someone from an opposing team gaining a huge amount of mass at once and then massacring all of the surrounding teammates with said mass. It's extremely frustrating to constantly be punished for others' mistakes.

Agario may be an extreme example but I think the principle generally stands. If a team can be punished for the mistakes (or griefing behavior) of one player, that game MUST allow players to create private games where they can control who joins. There is definitely a ceiling for the level of teamwork that a game can integrate without also allowing some measure of codependence and possible sabotage, so I don't think it's really the game's ""responsibility"" to force players to play a certain way, or to make it so that the game is ""playable"" even if no one is playing as intended. Adding depth to a cooperative game will necessarily make it more vulnerable to abuse.

As far as ""style"" hack and slashes like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, I think this is more the responsibility of the game to step in. Simply having a score go up for using different moves and combos is stupid and lazy. Make it so that an enemy's tendency to block or evade an attack goes up every time you use that attack in front of them; they can learn from your behavior and punish you for being predictable, just as they would in a real fight. This is a much more natural and holistic way of encouraging players to use a full range of different attacks."

* It's clear something else is going on from the time you hear the line ""Why? So you can kill us, too?"" Even if Walker did have to kill the first group in self-defense, the logical next step would be to radio command for next steps, whether that means going home, calling in backup, getting more intel, etc.
* You have absolutely no idea who has done what and who is affiliated with what. Walker doesn't know the affiliation of the corpses he comes across, or the people that are shooting at him. Again, you would want to know what's happening before opening fire.

PixelDungeon,fdl26c9,t3_ely4gt,1578515773.0,"FORKS: Shattered is both more complete and balanced. It's worth trying vanilla for the experience, and if you DO want to try it I would recommend doing it before Shattered, because there are so many QoL improvements in Shattered that it will be hard to switch to vanilla afterward. The biggest difference is durability in vanilla, which can become a very serious issue due to upgraded weapons degrading FASTER and ultimately leading to you having to do weird hacky stuff to prolong the life of your equipment (if it breaks you're screwed.)

BASIC COMBAT: Learn how to surprise attack. Run behind a door, and on the turn that the enemy opens a door, hit them. You get an unblockable critical hit. The same is true for any obstruction that you maneuver around in a V-shape. Do this with pillars or around tight corners, and when the enemy is in the middle of the V, hit them. If it's a pillar, going around a second time will cause them to lose sight of you.

BEGINNER TIPS: There's a lot of stuff to learn about different items and especially seeds, potions, and alchemy, so if you can, try to learn these a few at a time. Seed of Sungrass can give you a full heal if you plant/throw it, step on it, and DON'T MOVE until your health is done recovering. All seeds have different effects but this is the most important one. There is a compendium of different recipes you can use for crafting, and seeds have descriptions that talk about their effects, but read around and try to prioritize a few - it's a huge benefit and learning a few at a time is much easier than digesting it all at once.

TRAPS: Players sometimes notice traps and sometimes don't. This is dependent on luck as well as stats (Rogues get a bonus to detection, Ring of Detection in vanilla gets a bonus, and there's an artifact called Eye of something in Shattered that also boosts this ability.) If you suspect a trap (there are context clues that can hint at this) you can manually search with the magnifying glass to reveal traps with higher accuracy.

STATUES: Statues are tough enemies. Use the ? button to examine them and see which weapon they're holding. You don't know the different weapon types yet, but as you get more familiar with them you'll recognize when a statue has a weapon that will make them problematic to deal with. This is a double-edged sword, as the statue will drop the weapon it's holding upon defeat, meaning high risk = high reward. Using seeds, fire, poison, surprise attacks, etc. are the best option if you see a statue with an extremely powerful weapon. You'll learn more about these as you play, but you're probably better off just learning the fundamentals through trial and error if you're new.

IDENTIFYING POTIONS: You can identify potions and scrolls by using them, so usually it's not a good idea to use a Scroll of Identify for these. Potion of Flame and Potion of Toxic Gas will both hurt you, so your best bet is to drink an unidentified potion in water and not too far away from a door (entering a different room stops toxic gas spreading.) Also, there are certain rooms that can only be cleared with certain buffs granted by potions (for instance, a treasure chest on the other side of a chasm which can only be accessed with a Potion of Levitation, or a wooden barrier that can be burnt down with a Potion of Liquid Flame.) Explore a whole floor before drinking any unidentified potions, and if you see a room like this, at least one of your unidentified potions will give you the necessary buff to obtain this item - use these potions right next to this room.

IDENTIFYING SCROLLS: Usually it's safe to just use these scrolls as soon as you find them. That said, you don't want to waste Scrolls of Upgrade, so it might be a decent idea to have at least something worth upgrading before you start reading scrolls left and right. That said, a single wasted scroll usually isn't going to be the difference between life and death, so this is really not that serious of an issue. Once you've identified SoU, just use unidentified scrolls and you'll know what they are.

IDENTIFYING GEAR: Most people recommend equipping whatever you can in early-game and restarting if you get unlucky and equip something cursed. If this seems cheap to you, only identify things that you're about to equip (and obviously don't equip it if you see that it's cursed.) Once you have an identified Scroll of Remove Curse, you can use this as a backup for any cursed items; simply equip the item first, and if it's cursed, use the scroll. You can do this even for items that are too heavy to equip, since you can always just unequip them immediately after."

TIFU by fucking my cousin in the ass \[NSFW\]

Obligatory ""this actually happened a few years ago.""

So I was doing my undergrad at University of Texas in Austin. I knew I had a cousin there but we'd only met like once, at a family reunion when I was a little kid. Anyway, when I was at college I got a gig at Pizza Hut to make ends meet. You know, typical college job stuff.

Anyway, one night we get an order for a flat crust pizza with extra sausage. I go and deliver this bad boy, and am totally knocked off my feet by the girl that answers the door. She's around 5'4"" with juicy DD titties, long blonde hair and blue eyes. She looks vaguely familiar but I can't quite place where I've seen her before, so I figure maybe I just saw her around campus or something and forgot. Besides, it doesn't really matter. I'm planning on keeping it professional, dropping off the pizza and taking off.

But then this girl says she doesn't actually have the money for the pizza. My first thought is, ""Well, why the hell didn't she pay by card?"" and then, ""Why did she even order a pizza at all?"" But then she asks me if there's any other way she can pay for the pizza and I start to put two and two together. She comes in a little closer and brushes her hand up against me. I feel my millimeter Peter start to grow into a nine inch Grinch and things start getting hot and heavy.

Shower sex is a HUUUGE turn-on for me, so I ask if she wanted to do it in there. She said the shower was backed up - she had a plumber come over to clean her pipes earlier that day but he didn't actually fix anything. So at that point, I figured things were going to be pretty vanilla.

I start railing her from behind, and we're probably going at it for a good 10-15 minutes, but then this girl turns to me, winks, then bends over and spreads her ass cheeks a bit more. It's pretty clear what she wants so I slide my gooper in the pooper. It's much tighter than I expected and I found myself reaching climax really fast, but before I can finish she leans forward, making me slide out of her, then gets on her knees in front of me and starts jerking me off until I explode all over her face.

So after I leave, the image of her looking at me while I blew my load on her face kept running through my mind, and that's when it clicked. I hadn't seen this girl around campus after all. I saw her at my family reunion. She'd grown up a hell of a lot, but it was definitely her, and like I said, I already knew we were living in the same city[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Z4yW60I2w)

gantz,fdefywv,t1_fddagix,1578338190.0,"As characters, I liked the new Gantz team a lot. The issue is more that their role doesn't service the overall tone. Granted, I don't think the correct move would have been to just stick with the old team, especially because Kato and Kurono were meant to be foils to each other in the early volumes - in order for Kurono to change, Kato HAD to die.

On the flipside, we're meant to see Nishi as an example of what Kurono might have become under different circumstances, and maybe having one or two bad missions between the Buddhist Temple and Dinosaur missions would have brought this contrast into focus, especially because Kurono on his own would have a lot of trouble getting new members to listen to him, whereas a handful of recurring members would be much more credible.

I do agree that SOME characters seemed overly shitty (the online chatrooms talking about Kurono at the end were half hilarious and half downright cringe.) Also agree that more coverage of other Gantz teams would have been interesting, although considering the real explanation behind this (the aliens are merely imitating human culture) it's not as though making more cultural references would have added much to the story on a narrative level. Also, considering for most of the story, each Gantz team operates separately and in secrecy, it's unclear as to how much perspective the reader would really gain from more interactions with other teams anyway."
