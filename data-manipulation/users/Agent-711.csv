GetMotivated,fci6yj1,t1_fchyjur,1577658468.0,"How many people told you that you were full of it when you were contemplating suicide? How did that make you feel? And now you take rank with those poor souls who did that to you; those people who had no idea what they were talking about or what you were going through?

You read a couple of sentences and now claim to know everything about this person's struggles. You have shown no sympathy whatsoever and now you sit here demanding sympathy of your own from your soapbox. It seems hypocrisy abounds. You have completely dodged the question and gone off on a tangent about human suffering when my comment was about your lack of sympathy.

All of this is just your opinion. You have no idea what other people have been through and endured. Treating others this way just begets more of the same petty, dismissive treatment. You are begging for the same thing they did to you. You are begging for your own troubles to be dismissed. To be cared for and to be cared about, you must first care. 

You are not alone in your struggles."
