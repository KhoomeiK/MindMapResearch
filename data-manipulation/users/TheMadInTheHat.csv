AskReddit,fef2bwu,t3_eoe574,1579046518.0,"Mass Effect Andromeda got torn apart by critics and users alike, but it's my personal favorite of the series. The world-building is immersive, combat and vehicular gameplay is leagues above it's predecessors, the angara are fascinating, the planets are beyond beautiful and I actually **like** the dialogue. Peebee is my favorite mass effect romance out of all of them and the Kett are much more engaging enemies than the reapers. Of course the quest design is terrible, it's lack of paragon/renegade or ""action"" options during cutscenes is shameful and it's storytelling can be as bland as it's one-dimensional. I won't deny any of this, but in spite of all it's shortcomings it still is a fantastic game and one of a handful of games to genuinely make me cry. I've rarely felt this void after finishing a game or was left with such raw emotion and even grief."

That's okay and no reason to get upset, but sometimes a simple thing like a loud dad-sneeze, the sound of weights dropping at the gym or a cough will make me so mad that the flickering embers of hate blaze brightly within me, inciting a fire so massive that my only wish becomes driving a fork through the perpetrator's skull with the fury of a million suns pointing at a single egg, all channeled through a brilliant lens.
