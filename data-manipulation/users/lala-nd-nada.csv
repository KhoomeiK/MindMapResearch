StudentLoanSupport,ffdzbcl,t3_et1kxw,1579832677.0,"Ok, loans are also to cover cost of living while in school. Some people I know have bought cars with the loan money. I used mine to buy health insurance at one point. As long as you were in school and the money wasn't used in an illegal and untaxed way, there really isn't any way to verify what pot of money things come from. 

On your taxes, your student loans aren't considered income, as far as I remember. It may decrease the amount you get back from education credits, however, but that isn't much. You can claim the interest paid on your loans once you enter repayment. 

You will be ok. Just continue to get yourself in order, more hard financial decisions are yet to come."

Then, I had to go to work. I told my boss, because my job requires me to disclose life events and I just broke down. I realized that I had no one to talk to about it.

I reached out to an online community first, to find someone to talk to about all of the it. I disclosed everything to some poor, anonymous, Spaniard and he took it in stride. Thanks, Mattius, wherever you are.

I think the worse part that no one tells you about, though, is having to tell people you got divorced over and over again. Every time you see someone you haven't seen for a year or so, you have to relive the story. Or worse yet, when you have that one coworker or acquaintance who judges you for it. 

Anyway, what was the moment you realized you were going to be ok? Mine was I was walking the dog at 3 AM in the morning (he was having some tummy upset) in a particularly rough neighborhood (our old apartment) in the rain.

I just wanted to add that the amount of the fission products produced during this incident would have been extraordinary and the health professionals would not have known to take precautions at the beginning of the event. The dose they would have received from caring for contaminated workers would have been significant and compounding as they worked to triage the sick.

My suggestion is to pretend your tax returns and pay increases don't exist and put them toward debt. For example, my take-home pay  straight out of graduate school in 2015 was $3300 monthly. My salary is now double what it was then but I only take home $4222 a month. I,  of course, pay more in taxes but I automatically increased what I put more into my HSA, 401k, Roth IRA, my savings account, and towards my student loans. I started by paying $600 a month towards my loans when I made $3300 a month and for this upcoming year, I will pay $1,250 a monthly out of the $4222 a month.
