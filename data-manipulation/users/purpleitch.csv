Most of the time you can find cardboard boxes of fruits and such at farmers markets for the same price (sometimes cheaper).

Iâ€™d recommend a rhetorical thinking class (similar to philosophy), which is usually listed as an English course, and itâ€™s very critical thinking heavy. I love rhetoric courses because you end up talking about a variety of topics, not just literature (handy for non-English majors!). 

Another class I would recommend is technical writing. Sounds boring, and it kind of is. However, pretty much everyone will be writing some kind of communications in their professional life, so this class has been highly useful to me, and Iâ€™m still in school. This class basically just teaches you how to research, and how to write resumes. And it counted for my sophomore level writing class!"

college,fel35hz,t3_epqg1o,1579213046.0,"Produce:
Potatoes (cheap, easy)
Onions (flavah)
Garlic (because itâ€™s garlic)
Eggs (good source of protein)
Some whole grain bread for your sammiches or w/e

Meats:
Ground beef (foolproof)
Chicken breasts (can be made into anything)

Conversely if youâ€™re vegan or something:
Chickpeas are a cheaper alternative to tofu,
Black beans,
Mushrooms,
Shredded carrots,
Dat almond butter life (but itâ€™s pricey so you may wanna avoid it)

Pasta/grains:
getchu like 3lbs of elbow noodles, Walmart sells em;
5 lb bag of rice, 
some red beans (try to change your bean game up so itâ€™s not the same type of protein every time, youâ€™ll fuck up your stomach that way)


Dairy(if youâ€™re not vegan):
cheese(can really up the tasty factors, and gives you vitamin d too),
yogurt, but individual packs so they stay longer,
I NEVER BUY MILK IN BULK (Iâ€™m lactose intolerant, but I hated only drinking like 2 cups out of a gallon, itâ€™s a huge waste of money)

Frozen stuffs:
any frozen vegetable,
frozen pizzas (delicious, good for a treat, cheap as hell)

Snicky snacks:
fruit snacks are good, dried fruit and the like,
almonds, trail mix, etc,
granola bars,
bananas make a great snack! Lots of energy.

If youâ€™re a coffee drinker itâ€™s always helpful to make that at home too. Waaaaay cheaper

college,feig3w6,t3_ep1or8,1579137723.0,"So, yeah, that freshman 15 is notorious, but it has a lot of contributing factors: 

-people drink (illegally if youâ€™re in the states), and that is a lot of empty calories youâ€™re chugging down, and I remember many a time when I was 19, headed to Waffle House for my hangover meal the next morning. 

-no parents to tell you to eat broccoli. 

-I mean, pizza IS better than salad. 

-people eating at weird hours of the day, so you donâ€™t pay attention to your meal sizes. I would recommend little snicky snacks throughout the day, so you donâ€™t gorge late at nightâ€”thatâ€™s really whatâ€™ll put on the weight.

Above all, youâ€™ll have to go out of your way to eat healthy at a lot of universities, but thereâ€™s plenty of recreational athletic fun times to be had to burn those calories."

I only say that because Iâ€™ve had a few professors that really make me love my major, a few that are just good, and some that are just not good teachers. It really depends on your university. Good luck!"

Anyway, pack a lunch or little snacks. Quiet things like fruit snacks and granola bars are good. Try to avoid peanut based things, lots of people are sensitive to that nowadays and even residue can kill someone. I always have a water bottle on me so Iâ€™m not thirsty, and most university or college campuses have little refill stations everywhere. 

On really tough days (tests, midterms, finals), I would treat myself with a trip to Starbucks or a vending machine, just to break up the monotony of eating the same snicky snacks every day. You do you though, good luck!"

I went to App years ago, ended up at a community college, and now Iâ€™m here, and Iâ€™m much happier! More programs, better programs, etc, etc. Not saying App is a bad school, itâ€™s just so small that thereâ€™s not a ton you can do up there.
