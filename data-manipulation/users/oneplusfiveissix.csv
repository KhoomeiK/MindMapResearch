I can't see myself never fapping for the next 40 years if I am being totally honest but quitting porn I can do 100%"

xbox,ff3ljtu,t1_ff34wbk,1579543624.0,Don't worry others have convinced me to get my gaming pc from 2011 fixed \[probably needs upgrade cause it broke 3 years ago\] and simply hook it up with HDMI to a television then use a bluetooth remote. Suppose having it broken was not doing me any good anyways!
NoFap,ff27vw4,t3_eqw894,1579496362.0,"thanks man we gotta keep remembering its not worth giving in. Every new urge you are hit with is the addiction screming  in desperation ""PAY ATTENTION TO ME!"" No. Fuck you. I won't no matter how much you try, and I know you won't stop, the longer I resist the more the addiction panics, the more it tries new things. Those urges you are feeling means you are fucking winning. To keep winning keep letting those urges come and go."
NoFap,ff1utb1,t1_ff1g8pw,1579486671.0,"Yeah exactly... I did no fap in the past and even then I still thought I wasn't addicted but was cutting it out just because it gave ""powers"" This time I won't make the same mistakes, admitting I have a problem feels good. Also we have the same count :D Don't ever let me ""pass"" you :p \[there is only one way I can\]"
NoFap,ff1gpkg,t1_ff1b6jr,1579478957.0,"My first time seeing it I was MAYBE 9 years old. It was a channel that showed violent shows, murder cases etc and other mature shows like the Sopranos by day, it was left on from my parents. Anyways 8-9 year old me got up for a drink at 2AM. I wanted to check the weather channel to see if it was going to snow to build a snowman \[weekend\] anyways I turn the TV and I learned about sex through straight hardcore porn. It felt wrong but I kept watching out of curiosity. I seen many depraved things and my penis eventually began to hurt a little so I turned the tv off and went to bed. \[Didn't masturbate had no idea what that was\] Afterwords It changed my thoughts for the worse about that stuff :/"
NoFap,ff1es9n,t1_fezdbnq,1579478282.0,"I think you are right but for the most part but you can still be addicted to something with casual use. I made a post about it finally admitting I am an addict. I only watched porn a few times a month but would jerk it once or twice a week. Eventually I realized  the stuff I was fantasizing about was degrading to myself and women. I started no fap and told myself I don't get my 1-2 times a month porn and few times a week jerk off. INSTANTLY I was craving it knowing it was ""Taken"" from me.  Just my experience anyways"
NoFap,fexjl8n,t1_feet0zm,1579432035.0,Which porn blockers?
NoFap,fexibai,t1_fexhe0y,1579431466.0,"I actually, in the past had a ""no p"" streak of close to a year. I thought I was doing good \[I instead thought of bad stuff which at the time didn't think was bad for me\] Anyways it was because of that streak I thought I proved I could handle PMO and relasped. So in essence yeah, the number doesn't matter so much if you have the wrong mentality. Thanks I will stay motivated, I am an addict."
NoFap,fexhqcd,t1_fexgwn3,1579431191.0,"well this goes to both of you.

Notice you resist something, maybe one website, one whatever and later you are then presented with something ELSE by your brain because its first try failed.

This is PROOF it is not YOU that wants to watch or MO its the addiction. It is your addicted, damaged brain trying to get you to do something you just told it you do not want to. Next time it will happen again. Remember this, remember the feeling you had when you relasped. It will never be rewarding. Those urges are never ""Real"" in that just getting it over with is never going to be the answe. That is the great lie the addiction tells your brain to tell You. Take this ""Defeat"" and use it to come back twice as hard- to win the war!

NoFap,fexgoot,t1_fexfvh1,1579430699.0,"Hey I want to ask you something-

Did your brain change up its tactics to get you to relaspe? Did you start out resisting one thing but it tried something else?"

Order a few dollars worth, 47-60 day delivery. Ehh I don't need em till later anywho. 61 days later I open a dispute. Seller has been removed for violating terms of service. Somehow am able to message him though through the request refund through email.

Even if it does work for 30 days, even 90 days it could have a pre-mature death for all I know which is why I am starting to lean towards buying new. If they respond to my request to send a unit that had only external problems during refurbished I will buy, if not I am gonna pass"
xbox,fej9y80,t1_fej99l9,1579163405.0,oh there is cheaper ones in price but if they are outside canada 25-30 CAD import and almost every one of them has 20-40 CAD shipping. There was a used one for 155CAD which was amazing but after shipping and fees it came to around 220!
Ebay,fej91yn,t1_fej82z5,1579162185.0,"thats horrifying, they are actually responding to all my questions on ebay funny enough... Thanks though that will for sure impact my decision although other canadian reviews said they got their x box no issue... man Im gonna pull my hair out on this one!"

u/MassiR77 WOOPS reading error on my part, you meant current price for a one S NEW.

 189.95 USD for a 500gb unit off walmart for a BRAND NEW xbox one S.

Brand new:

\-New, don't have to worry about it breaking or being faulty.

\- one year Warranty

Refurbished:

\-Might be good OR bad. At best used and cleaned, at worst it could have fried internals

\- 50 USD Cheaper \[65.23 CAD\]

\-90 day warranty

Thats really it... If I get refurb the money saved gets me skyrim for ""free"""
xbox,fej3tvj,t1_fej38js,1579155867.0,"139.49 USD comes with all the hook-ups and one controller \[I asked seller\]

Free shipping no Imports \[They are in Canada! :D\]

Thing is it's not a single listing... Maybe I could ask for one that was refurbished in a certain way from their stock? They have so many units they may not be able to tell me. It is worth a try though, what should I ask?

Thanks for the reply btw!"

Hmmm after reading that I think I will use full orcish upgraded to cap and Spellbreaker as my shield, with a max cap shield 85% is blocked and after 80% of the remaining 15, which is a mere 3% of an attack damaged recieved by URGGH!

So even if spellbreaker cannot reach shield cap with all block perks and it lets in a little more than 3% the magic immunity it gives me with atronach stone is well well worth it! Wow, I can't wait to play, I am gonna set it to master to make this a challenge. THANKS AGAIN!"
