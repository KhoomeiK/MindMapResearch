No they are not! The first article puts a lot of numbered brackets everywhere, but there is no references list at the end of it. They lead nowhere. Moreover, it jumps from ""fact"" to ""fact"", using one to explain the other, without any actual causal links between them. Here's how easy it is to make something look ""sourced"" and authentic:

> Studies have found that drinking water can contribute to high levels of Alzheimer [1]. Since ancient times societies has given preference to fermenting water into beer [2], and the excessive consumption of water has been linked to plague epidemics in China [3], Siam [4], Constantinople [5], and London [6]. Starting from the late 19th century however, the rise of lucrative water companies such as Nestlé [7] has shifted public policies into campaigns for hidration, despite overwhelming evidence against it [8].

Finally, the article makes plenty of use of the association falacy, using proof of something (let's ignore here the entire lack of proof) to induce a conclusion of something else (e.g. porn is violent, therefore viewers become violent too). This is no better than an anti-vaxxer's sales pitch.

One thing the article does touch upon, although it doesn't frame it as such, is porn addiction, which is a real thing and needs to be addressed in society. It, however, frames addiction behaviour as *normal* behaviour, as in, anyone who watches porn will have these, which is not true at all."

In countries like Pakistan and the Phillipines, they'll speak their national language on the street, but their textbooks are all in English, government or conferences are in English, even business offices may give preference to English. It's more akin to the difference between a formal and informal setting.

People in non-English speaking countries can spend days, weeks, months, or years straight without using the language if they so choose, regardless of how well they speak it."
todayilearned,fdq6dds,t1_fdq2kr1,1578656836.0,"Nah they can, they just don't. If you speak in English with them, slowly and using simpler terms, everyone will understand you, even if they say they don't."

It sorta makes sense too, given that they are releasing for free (the Japanese Jump app charges 3 dollars per issue, no such thing as a free lunch). And both the app and website were built around this limitation, not being able to zoom in, not being able to save pictures... but it's super broken, site and app both, and now they clearly don't wanna pay for new ones.

The translation though, is the part that simply has no excuse. Both Viz and Stephen are super stubborn, and have no desire to adapt to their audience. This is what a monopoly is like."
OnePiece,fdp0527,t1_fdn61ck,1578616856.0,"At least Sanji has been dreaming of the All Blue since he was a kid, and it was the reason he went with Luffy in the first place. Nami, otoh, literally only mentioned charting a world map that one time in the barrel scene."
LateStageCapitalism,fdox9yr,t1_fdn584z,1578614980.0,"World peace, not world domination.

Kim Jon-Un doesn't hold the power to dominate the world, but he sure holds it to destabilize it. Remember WWI, the biggest destabilizing force at the time were the Balkans, it was known for years prior to the war, and sure enough that's what set it in motion. Their participation, however, all but ended there."
LateStageCapitalism,fdouknz,t1_fdngqsk,1578613213.0,"Yeah, but tax code can change for the better, not only worse. For instance, instead of extending inheritance tax for the middle and lower classes, increase the tax for the wealthy, and increase a lot for the ultra-wealthy.

A billionaire that's taxed at 95% their wealth will still bequeath 50 million dollars to their heirs. Quite plenty if you ask me."
todayilearned,fdm9fc4,t1_fdlpcmi,1578543116.0,"Every film does storyboards, though. Well, not *every* film, but it's a pretty standard resource in film-making. Doesn't stop there either, with many productions making timing predictions for every scene, drawing up lighting maps, even so far as constructing the scene first on 3D and doing crude animations. When a simple 5 seconds take can consume hours of preparation, and time on set = money rolling, you wanna leave as little decision-making to it as possible. Fury Road, if indeed didn't have a script, just side-stepped the first of many representations of the final product.

Ok, we can go back to gushing over Fury Road now. That film was awesome!"
ClimateOffensive,fdm7471,t3_el9276,1578541427.0,">  I feel the true problem is the lack of educational and media resources out there that can communicate the problem to boomers and general Australians.

I wish that was the real problem. That is easy(er) to deal with.

Here's the thing: both my parents are biologists. Moreover, ecologists, and both made careers out of conservation and sustainable development. They are intelligent people, with graduate degrees, who go to conferences and are active in the scientific community. And yes, both know everything there is to know about climate change.

Last elections, they both voted for the anti-environmentalism, anti-intellectualism, right-wing head of state. During the campaign they were both in active denial, pretending like he wouldn't actually do all the things he said he would (and that - surprise - he's doing), and even now they are both hovering around the issue, trying as best as they can not to think about.

In the end, what boomers lack is not necessarily knowledge, but something else. Something that drives them to cling to memes and false promises, and disregard any attempt at breaking the illusion, however well-founded it be. While *that* is not addressed, I fear any proselytizing will fall on deaf ears."
OnePiece,fdlxelq,t3_elkeed,1578534788.0,"Very nice!

One catch though is about spoilers - when you load the next chapter, it shows the other pages in the loading animation before coming to the first one. I suggest putting some static loading screen to prevent that from happening.

Also happens when going backwards, though it's less of an issue then."

LateStageCapitalism,fdkunfb,t1_fdjruzn,1578511505.0,"How is that so? Many countries did just that during the 70's, with the wave of colonial liberations. Including many deciding to turn to socialism. Vietnam was a warning to no one, aside from perhaps the US, which should have learned its lesson but sheeply clings to old-fashioned notions."

One catch though, you mention Oda recycling a generic pirate's design for Rayleigh's, but that was always supposed to be the Dark King.

Oda mentioned once how he made sure to tell the guys at Toei that the pirate smacking Buggy and Shanks' heads was the first mate, _not_ the captain, in case they wanted to include extra details in that scene. This because it was already planned that that was Roger's ship, but he couldn't tell them that just yet."

OnePiece,fdcr1wl,t1_fdcfc0c,1578281921.0,"So was Garp. Also, Oda himself stated that the ranks don't mean much, as a captain from the 4 seas would be much weaker than a captain from the Grand Line, and weaker still than a captain from Marine HQ. Heck, Helmeppo's dad was a captain. These ranks all feel very political, which we actually know for a fact from Smoker."
OnePiece,fdcqfph,t1_fdc1g25,1578281461.0,"I doubt that. Snakeman is fast, yes, but Kaido is *very* fast. His attack that took down Luffy was the Divination **Thunder**. As in, he moved so fast that his attack cracked the speed of sound, producing a sound like thunder. If you see read that scene again, you see that Luffy barely moves, probably didn't even see it coming.

I don't think Kaido will be out-fasted, especially given that Luffy is training his armament haki, not any speed-relatef ability."
OnePiece,fdco9h8,t1_fdbmg4x,1578279861.0,"Just to add to the list, One Piece in Brazil used to be released in volumes with fixed number of pages. As in, every volume had like, 100 pages or so, and that's it. So, if even *one* chapter in the volume ran for a couple of pages longer than normal, the last chapter would get its last few pages cut off. If there happened to be a chapter with fewer pages, at the end of the volume you'd get the first few pages of a new chapter, and the rest on the next volume.

Prime editorial."

The Cambridge Analytica is but one of many documented cases of targeted propaganda in social media, yet people can't be assed into basic fact checking. They are being lied to their faces, they know that, and they just shrugg it off.

We live in dangerously apathetic times."
