news,ffo72xp,t1_ffnv4wv,1580074804.0,We’ve had incredibly bad fog here in SoCal the last few nights/mornings. I’ve driven home not being able to see further than 10 feet in front of me. I wonder if weather was the cause.
news,ffo6fn2,t1_ffnvsqv,1580074592.0,"I know it got turned into a meme, but that video of him explaining basketball to her is really touching. He seemed like a good dad."
movies,fflelos,t1_ffld23q,1580038678.0,Yeah...that’s the point (¿) The small committee that’s actually forced to watch the movies and discuss their rankings together is the proposal. I’m not sure you read my comment correctly.
movies,ffkg5dx,t1_ffkan8p,1580022217.0,That’s nice to hear that the guy who seems like a good guy on his show is actually a good guy! He’s one of the few entertainment YouTube hosts I watch; his reviews are aces.
news,ffk03he,t1_ffjx0lg,1580011737.0,The problem with your comment is that it’s too logical. What will the 24-hour news cycle do if we all collectively decide to get off the outrage chain?
movies,ffjzfmk,t1_ffjndz6,1580011197.0,"Dan Murrell from Screen Junkies had a good suggestion: make small committees vote on only one category and make sure they watch them. So a caucus of votes on costume design contenders, and another watches the editing contenders. It’s not a flawless idea, but it would at least help make sure the movies get seen."
StarWarsLeaks,ffiw8zc,t1_ffimry2,1579984222.0,"I think it’s just uncomfortable for everyone to watch movies that are so explicitly fighting with one another, regardless of how you feel about TLJ. It’s like going over to a friend’s house and their parents are screaming at each other at the dinner table."
StarWarsLeaks,ffivu3c,t1_ffitgpb,1579983926.0,"I don’t like criticizing KK on Reddit because it sends off the bat signal for bad faith actors to spout their BS, but I think this dust-up was a combination of things:

1) Disney needing to capitalize on their new IP so they rush TFA. They still turn out a wonderfully fun (if derivative) movie. 

2) Rushing TFA meant there was so plan for the saga, so KK didn’t try to reign in Rian’s script to make it fit more with TFA. (For the record, I like Rian’s vision of Star Wars much better but it does feel incongruous with the previous movie). 

3) Because the aforementioned lack of planning, Colin and Lucasfilm can’t agree on a script. He gets bounced. It’s now September 2017, and to make the 2019 release date Disney has to replace him by early 2018 at the absolute latest. 

4) Disney refuses to move back the release date because they’ve based their yearly projections, theme parks, and Disney Plus release around their current schedule 

5) They bring back JJ who agrees to come back on the condition that he be allowed to let his freak flag fly and not be beholden to others if they want him to meet their deadline. 

6) JJ rips out his diary entries from December 2017 saying how Rian is a fugly slut and turns that in as his script. That diary entry is then made into a 2.5 hour movie. 

So basically the real enemies here are time and capitalism. Long live the lobster queen."
movies,ffgt1pl,t1_ffgqln1,1579914327.0,That’s fine. That’s how movie opinions work.
movies,ffgngqv,t1_ffgd8x5,1579910336.0,"I don’t think they’re the same. But I am amused that people get so defensive of what’s a pretty mild movie review: that Joker was good, but ultimately suffers from its message and framing warring with one another. The movie also thinks it’s much smarter than it actually is. *We live in a society...*"
StarWarsLeaks,ffgk1l3,t1_ffgfrpk,1579908023.0,"Legend says if you place an important object in a mysterious box and click your heels 3 times, JJ appears over your shoulder and asks you in a whisper to please please please like his movie."
movies,fffxnq3,t1_fffuz6p,1579894052.0,"The way Mendes takes what could be a gimmick and instead uses the one-shot style to present perspective in really inventive ways. He successful crafts a touching character arc out of little dialogue and visual choices. It somehow manages to be well-paced despite the editing limitations imposed by the way they shot it. It’s the best and most cohesive blend of direction, cinematography, performance, and set design I’ve seen in recent memory."
movies,fffx5wx,t1_fffv86y,1579893746.0,"I saw Parasite for the first time last night, it’s been on my mind. But it’s impossible to discuss Joker’s flaws with its die-hard fans because they view it as an attack on themselves rather than the movie. Take your choice wording in ‘belittling’; I criticized a movie produced by a multibillion dollar corporation and directed by a someone with a successful franchise under his belt and you saw that as me belittling you."
movies,fffuebb,t1_ffftlov,1579892009.0,"Joker is the most political movie of the year. It talks about lack of public funding, classism, and income inequality. The opening lines are explicitly about the government failing the people."
movies,fffu69z,t1_ffftmjj,1579891870.0,"I don’t hate it. I thought it was fine. I also think the only reason it’s getting so much attention is that men feel starved of movies that actually address their emotions and connected to Joker, despite it being so narratively-confused. The real tragedy is that there are actually lots of amazing movies that talk about men struggling to find their place in society, but the mass audience isn’t watching them because theaters just play Marvel movies."
movies,fffsmp8,t1_fffrx09,1579890917.0,"I’m not going to re-litigate Joker, because I am truly glad people seemed to enjoy it and find it meaningful, but mostly because I don’t want to. But I will say the Joker’s depiction of mass backlash is more Baby’s First Societal Commentary^^TM and the Joker’s relationship with the protestors and fame makes progressively less sense as the movie goes on. He says he’s apolitical, but his big mission statement is exactly the political message the protestors are rallying around. My biggest issue with this movie is the disconnect between dialogue and framing, which feels less of an artistic choice and more of a mistake."
movies,fffr8a6,t1_fffqqk8,1579890049.0,"Parasite shows how a man can be driven to madness by an class disparity and an unfeeling society, who eventually stops trying to rise above his station because he feel he’ll never achieve it. It’s the plot of Joker, on paper."
movies,fffpblq,t1_fffmxpd,1579888869.0,"If it had just been that, the movie wouldn’t be getting this much attention. The really impressive thing is how Mendes uses the “one-shot” style to completely change the audience’s perspective in the story: danger and monumental moments are presented with bone-clenching fear and confusion and not the highlighted gravitas Hollywood usually uses. There are many scenes where the camera is focusing on something else while the real danger presents itself off-screen, or in the corner of the frame. There’s not a single wasted reference, lingering of the camera, or line of dialogue in this movie. They all serve to immerse us in this one’s character’s journey to accepting his emotions and welcoming connection to other people."
movies,fffoksb,t1_fffjej3,1579888411.0,"For me, Waves and The Farewell replace Ford v Ferrari and Joker on this list. I thought Marriage Story was truly excellent, but what holds it back for me is that Bombach (and also Gerwig in Little Women) don’t write characters that speak like actual humans, they speak like actors in a play in New York. Small nitpick, because otherwise I really loved Marriage Story."
movies,fffo4us,t1_fffjtrf,1579888143.0,"Parasite is what Joker *thought* it was, I said what I said."
FigureSkating,ffek4d4,t1_ffe5koc,1579851346.0,Sasha walked so Mariah could run
news,ffeg4mp,t1_ffdwqhj,1579846696.0,"Ugh. This is fear-mongering. Most major research institutions will have Biosafety Level 3 labs, which is the level where the shit you touch gets dicey. So millions of people in every major city are in close proximity to these labs, but they don’t exactly go around broadcasting this because the general public doesn’t get how lab protections works."
AskReddit,ffebbqo,t1_ffdnqkc,1579842005.0,"This sounds similar to my friends from China; it’s not that they don’t know about democracy and don’t recognize when their freedoms are being curtailed—they just value other things more. Individual success and rights seem less valuable to them than those of the masses, this greater good mentality. It’s fascinating talking about politics and culture with them because it’s a completely different perspective than North American or the UK."

The theme of The Last Jedi wasnâ€™t subverting expectations, it was that we have to learn from our past and our mistakes or else they will haunt us forever. Only people unfamiliar with Rian Johnsonâ€™s filmography think subverting expectations was a theme, because every single one of his movies is a twist on the genre heâ€™s operating in.

But, to your point, governments and their corruption absolutely do affect income distributionâ€”they decide what business is undertaken in their countries, how their businesses/workers are taxed, and which people receive coveted positions of power. Countries that most identify with workers movements and citizen equality are also almost always run by a ruling class of oligarchs.

You can have a show thatâ€™s overall great in quality but still writes their female characters with what men writers *think* is the female perspective vs what it actually is. The â€œmale vs femaleâ€ gaze aspect is important; for a good example, take a look at the Amazon costumes made for Patty Jenkinsâ€™ Wonder Woman vs Justice League.

Once you realize that those people screaming on the television arenâ€™t actually outraged about your socioeconomic concerns and are just trying to fill a 24 hour news channel in a way that gets the most eyeballs on their adverts, youâ€™ll gain a lot of chill. 

The Fox News panelists living in Manhattan donâ€™t care how many South American migrants are waiting at the border. The MSNBC panelists donâ€™t care that Trump is a creepy pervert who cheats on his wivesâ€”their bosses do the same and worse. Outrage culture is money, and anything to illicit it is valuable currency. 

I voted for Clinton, but I told a man on a train in Germany in 2017 that Trump would win the next election when the media takeaways failed to acknowledge that the last two decades of globalization have energized the cities and destroyed rural America.  Trump voters said their factories and stores were shutting down and their communities were being overtaken by drugs and poverty, and Clinton voters said the global economy has brought the country into a new generation of growth and progress. Neither group was lying, the truth depends on where you live."
