ethfinance,ffjk5wc,t1_ffjgb0p,1580000073.0,"Through competition consumers would likely get some semblance of the rates passed on to them.  If one bank takes 5.5% of the DSR, while another only takes 1-2% of the DSR, customers will flock to option #2.  And we need to be 100% realistic in that laypeople will not want the liability of “being their own banker,” because as I said most people don’t even have the skills or education to participate in Forex or equities markets.  Even if DeFi is drastically simplified people just won’t be interested in financial self sovereignty.  Also, when I say bank, I really mean any financial institution that holds customers’ deposits.  

No matter how many tutorials, education, etc, a good amount of people will not interface with DeFi as you and I are now.  I’ve told plenty of people close to me about the yield and other possibilities achieved through DeFi and while they find it interesting, they ultimately don’t participate.  Yea this shit seems simple enough to us, but we’re early adopters who willingly go out of our way to enter the ecosystem. 

That’s not to say the future you’re describing isn’t possible, but I believe the majority will gain indirect exposure though financial institutions and Financial Advisors.  Financial Advisors aren’t going away, what uber wealthy person has the time and energy to manage and grow their wealth on their own?  What wealth person actually *wants* the responsibility of managing that money?  They’re going to entrust that responsibility to financial fiduciaries.    

We have the option to circumvent banks, *somewhat*, but to truly beat the banks we would need to be paid in natively digital assets that are interoperable with the Ethereum network.  That means that 1). Major countries issue digital assets, 2). Those assets are issued on a blockchain, 3). Those assets are operable on DeFi protocols.  If people aren’t paid in digital assets the majority won’t want to go through the friction and risk of opening an account on an exchange, converting fiat to crypto and sending it to a DeFi protocol through a Web3 browser.  Then you also need to think of security, hardware wallets vs hot wallets, etc.  That security risk alone is significant.  That’s not even mentioning all the scams that would proliferate."
Ripple,ffjceja,t1_ffjbo6e,1579995348.0,"Well with ongoing litigation regarding XRP being a security, I don’t blame financial institutions for not wanting to use ODL"
ethfinance,ffil0eq,t3_etszhe,1579976396.0,"I don’t think your everyday person will have a desire to interact with DeFi, in the same sense that the everyday person doesn’t interact with Forex markets or stocks.

What will happen, is financial institutions will utilize DeFi on the backend to obtain yields higher than traditional finance for customers (and themselves) 

For ex. You deposit money at a bank, and the bank converts that fiat into DAI, USDC, etc (crypto within the banks risk tolerance).  They then pool their deposits into a DeFi protocol and the yield on those deposits is then passed on to the customer.

Other than that, Financial Advisors will act as the middle men between customers and DeFi protocols.  You give your money to your FA to manage, who then will convert it into DAI, USDC, to obtain high yields with relatively low risk. 

While it’s a great goal for everyone to become their own banker, most people *wont* want to.  It’s too much of a liability.  Like I said, traditional finance is already complex for laypeople, what makes us think that Ethereum smart contracts and lending protocols will be any simpler for laypeople?

For this to come to fruition, regulatory clarity and insurance need to be established and developed.  Other than that, the DeFi market needs to mature so it consistently achieves yields higher than traditional finance.  With Trump calling for negative rates and most of Europe already negative, traditional finance will yield low rates for the foreseeable future (at least as it relates to non-accredited investors)."
