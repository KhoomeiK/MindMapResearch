I also am at 1200 calories a day at 5'1 and it's not easy making sure you're getting all the right stuff as there's not a lot of wiggle room for empty calories. I noticed after a while I was making myself pretty deficient in vital nutrients-- especially iron, potassium, and the B group and was starving all the time. With some adjustments to what I'm eating, a low sodium V8 and a couple of different vitamins I'm finding that 1200 a day is plenty if I'm making good choices.  As far as your original question, benefiber has a clear mix you can add into water but honestly it does Jack-all for your appetite.  If you're positive you are getting all the nutrients you need and 1200 is okay at your current activity level, my biggest crutch is sugar free jello with some fruit cut up in it."
loseit,ff7ql3u,t3_erjjuq,1579655954.0,"I am about 35lbs overweight (significant as I am just over 5' tall) and I'm the smallest woman in my family by at least 100lbs. I really think it's about perspective, like when I was a teenager and thought I would absolutely die of morbid obesity if I was anything over 130lbs. When I was 20 (I'm almost 40 now) I was 105lbs (actually considered ideal for my height) and was asked constantly is I was ill and expressions of concern I had an eating disorder."

dogs,fevx1wf,t3_eqpoak,1579402555.0,"He's decided butter is a very valuable resource! My dog exclusively hides bones in our couch cushions that she will regularly dig out/reposition. Other toys, balls, treats etc she doesnt care to stash, but a bone? Won't even gnaw on it. Straight into the cushions. The only thing that doesn't sound normal is your dogs apparent regular access to full sticks of butter lol."
gameofthrones,feid2kp,t3_ep68xr,1579135676.0,When we went the GoT theme tour really took us to a lot of lackluster filming spots tbh. The props and costumes tour was on at the time...not sure if it's still there but thought that was worth going to.  Burned down kings landing set was even on site. Dark Hedges was cool but you can only go so far back and most of the tours are on strict schedules. Honestly Northern Ireland is so gorgeous I wish we had skipped the themed tour and taken one of the other ones.
dogs,fdnm0cr,t1_fdngvh8,1578588594.0,"We are pretty sure she's an Aussie mix and she definitely has a lot of Aussie quirks! I don't think she's purebred, but has some herding tendencies, sticks by your side, aloof with strangers, and is protective of those she decides are ""her people"". She does have some PTSD issues from life on the streets....can be pretty nervous/jumpy, stranger danger, has a really hard time warming up to young, clean shaven men. Overall though we're just so impressed with how bright and trainable she is. We are forever grateful to the rescue group that pulled her from the shelter to give her a chance at a good life. She's really an absolute doll."
progresspics,fdm88w1,t3_em3j1s,1578542242.0,"I'm also the same SW and height...I'm 39 though and have a GW of 125lbs. You look amazing.  I have a feeling I'm going to have a lot of loose skin. Very realistic timeline you accomplished this in. I get so discouraged by people that are able to lose 60lbs in like 6-8 months as it makes me feel like there's something wrong with me. I know others find quick loss inspiring, but I've been at it 3 months and have only lost around 10lbs..never even had a big initial dip like so many do. I'm going to see it through but have accepted consistency is the only way!"

dogs,fdlwv8m,t3_em0qzk,1578534425.0,"Thanks everyone! I love her to bits. When they got her the locals said she had been running the streets eating out of fast food garbage cans and she was a mess. She's also a scaredy dog, but once we gained her trust she's a complete velcro dog. Wicked smart.  Her foster worked with her getting her house trained and learning basic commands which was awesome. She is still quite afraid of strangers, particularly young men without beards so that has been a challenge, but overall a great dog and huge love bug to our family. They estimated her to be between 6-8 years old which is exactly what we were looking for. (We dropped a small fortune on her teeth....as bad as you would expect a dog eating trash for an extended period of time would have).  I just can't believe the difference just one year made in this dogs life. She has it made in the shade now and totally knows it."
dogs,fdljyzv,t1_fdljtgd,1578525726.0,I had no idea how much she'd been through before she was healthy enough to offer for adoption. Pic about broke my heart!
todayilearned,f54e159,t1_f5018ig,1571978939.0,"The owner is clearly a sadist. Personally I found the video very disturbing. He genuinely gets his jollies from doing this and thinks its ""great"" someone actually had a heart attack there years ago. I don't know if it's a sexual thing, but theres a reason he doesnt charge for it. Why people would put themselves through it is another thing entirely. I mean good on him for finding a legal loophole to torture people, and all participants are willing enough and safe words are employed and all that. If I was his neighbor I'd definitely move, however."
