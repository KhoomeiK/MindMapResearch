As others have said , document and get some legal advice. Is there any point getting a restraining order on her coming near you? Good luck take it one step at a time."
JUSTNOMIL,ffg8055,t3_et77yg,1579900439.0,"How rude and disrespectful  of your relatives. Don't stay with them again and no babysitting by smokers ever. Concentrate on your little family and look forward .  It's the same rule with hotel rooms, if it stinks of smoke it's rejected. They should join the modern world. Accepting smokers around babies and children is as dumb as anti vaccers."

JUSTNOMIL,ffcuzrl,t3_esuq34,1579807810.0,"I would definitely only have them for one day, not two. Too much . They might get thru the wedding ok but a second. Day of events, no way. I would also ban them seeing you get dressed , hair and makeup ready as u don't need bitchy comments when you're most nervous. They get to see I dressed as u walk down aisle like other guests. Have a great day and take control."

Parenting,ffa6272,t3_esfssb,1579728588.0,"Keep everything legal and do what your lawyer advises. Verbal agreements are worth nothing, he may well get much meaner when he gets another partner. Your job is to ensure you have enough resources to bring up your child. She is entitled to legal resources."

offmychest,ff46tbc,t3_er71dd,1579556801.0,I have been through this lots of times with all my different rescue dogs and it's heartbreaking and you never forget the quirks of every dog and the laughs. A wise dog rescuer told me not to be so sad as my dog had a great life and her death meant there was more room in the Ark for another rescue. I  soo sorry for your loss.
news,ff08lvy,t3_eqw7ct,1579466334.0,"Australia is rapidly losing everything that makes it special and decades of bad governments doing nothing to control land clearing, water waste ,emissions and outdated farming techniques . To many politicians the words environment and conservation are rubbish. V sad, I wish 16 year olds could vote. As David Attenborough says , our generation has stuffed it right up."
offmychest,ff07cgz,t3_eqygub,1579465961.0,"His excuses are just things his lawyer told him to say , nothing to do with you or your behaviour. There is no way his addiction is a recent thing. He's a pro. Don't waste any brain space on thiis pos, well done for getting away."

Parenting,fex8e18,t3_eqm1b9,1579426778.0,BYW I fully expect you to cop more shit as anyone else ... father  privelidges . He's way younger than his age and I get that it's so confusing about indulging or tough  love. Trust yourself but everyone however cynical and smart arsed needs to hear they are loved and special
Parenting,fewuvnd,t1_fewoujk,1579419854.0,"Yes that pessimism is his defence as he has had young heartbreak. I think he needs you to be Dad badly and keep telling him you love him and how special and important he is. He needs to feel someone is in control and gives a dn about him imho. I know it won't be easy but don't underestimate your unique position as his Dad even if he's foul to you. All the best , I reckon all u can do with a v hurt human man child is be honest and care."
JUSTNOMIL,feul890,t1_fetuxi3,1579387624.0,It would be great if your group could move on and discuss life and good things rather than just talking about the Ferals and the abuse. I guess that will come with no contact. Try to make the future about the family you love and like. Divorce them in your heads. Maybe even have a party and symbolically erase them. It's quite an achievement they all survived.
JUSTNOMIL,feudfyn,t3_eqk2tp,1579385513.0,Decluttering is great especially when it involves in law relatives you don't have anything in common with. You've got enough on your plate.
Parenting,feubkya,t3_eqm1b9,1579384973.0,"If there is anything you can enjoy doing together do it. What makes him laugh?  If he's going to therapy and taking his meds that's good. Does he have access to guns cos that would be worrying. I hope he can find a passion - and some enthusiasm for life. It doesn't just happen though he has to want to get more out of life. Stay friends , you may be his only one and don't forget to tell him you love him. Good luck"

JUSTNOMIL,feu3iis,t3_eqkb40,1579382746.0,She is totally nuts. I wouldn't bother at all. Can't you ring the men in white coats to come and get her... better still find a cult and join her up.
offmychest,fekzae6,t3_eplkwa,1579210713.0,"What you've been through is really awful and shocking and sad. Forgive your Dad for making a bad choice and promise yourself you'll live your life to the full . Get help and avoid negative people . Grieve at your pace. It's really true isn't it that saying... "".  Suicide doesn't solve your problems, it just hands them to someone else."" Look after you."
JUSTNOMIL,fekxlts,t3_epnl0m,1579209704.0,"This must be so stressful, why have a shower and invite people you don't know or like. With all the fuss and too many cooks things were bound to go pearshaped. I couldn't cope and would prefer a small dinner party without the designer stress.,,, your Mum sounds great. Still at least you've got the funny photos to laugh at."
offmychest,fekv5qo,t3_epnmbv,1579208251.0,"When you get into your own flat give some thought to adopting a rescue pet. Nothing like an animal best friend to calm and make you laugh . I think you will be ok, your insight is great and you have an aim. What you have been through can be left behind in time. It could be part of what makes you a stronger person.. well done for getting so far."
JUSTNOMIL,fej3dc3,t3_epdi23,1579155372.0,"Hi that's awful and exhausting and unhealthy for you. I would start planning to change the terms of the marriage, don't see the in laws , separate holidays . etc... you can't control what they do or say , including your husband when you are trying your hardest, so stop trying and caring. Easy said I know  but you are banging your head on a brick wall. Your partner is not what you hoped and you may decide to divorce but plan it properly. With some more independence you might feel less hurt. Don't tell your partner of your plans until u have custody etc sorted. He may get the shock of his life when you stop caring, and he might change but it sounds unlikely. Get counselling for you , try couples counselling , but start getting what you want and maybe realise he's a roadblock to progress. Life's too short. Lots of hugs and care."

JUSTNOMIL,feeg2v0,t3_eom7lc,1579033033.0,"Wow, well done but I wouldn't have the patience for such circular pointless rants. I'd just cut her off politely saying  I haven't got time or the interest in these dumb discussions that go nowhere. If you haven't got anything fun or interesting to talk about let's stop
the silly sniping. Ancient history is boring."
JUSTNOMIL,feazkat,t3_eo1bsd,1578953893.0,"Best thing I ever did was leave home as a teenager. Real problems like supporting yourself and educating yourself become clear, psycho games and guilt trips and self doubt recede as you get busy and successful. You really can't grow carrying around her problems and anger - and you can't fix them either. Stay away and be nice to yourself. She's got real problems."
JUSTNOMIL,feanqct,t3_eo5duw,1578950652.0,"You could feign concern for her and remind her not to lose too much weight as it will make her look older.  That old beauty cliche "" after a certain age a woman has to choose between her face or her figure."". Let a few squirrels loose in her brain and relax, your doing fine, limit time with negative people."

This plus drought and climate change , plus the little shit arsonists is disastrous . Then add a religious govt which denies climate change and you have a Gondwana doomed continent."

Re climate change our govt is promoting huge new coal mines- check out Adanis filthy history, and Clive Palmers proposals, these plus Queenslands continued land clearing is killing our reef. We lead the world in species extinction and all they assist are mines and old power stations claiming renewable energy simply won't cut it, we have many politicians who are religious and owned by coal and iron ore companies. Tragic and hopeless while these fools are in power."

Talking to strangers is easier if it's about a commen interest... if your playing a game or learning a new skill just like they are. Relationships are good and bad, most people are scared too and everyone behaves badly sometimes and makes mistakes. Accept your fears and risk a bit. I don't think anyone feels 100 percent confident and secure."

Well done for jailing your abuser, don't waste your life tolerating a different sort of abuse. I don't think your husband has much to offer. You deserve some peace , happiness and care."
