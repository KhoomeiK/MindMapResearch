My reasoning is, anyone who thinks TWAW is complicit in the way women are being forced to share their single sex spaces with men and boys.

badparking,fcdqs60,t1_fcdhpr8,1577612702.0,"I don't push them when I tuck them in, it's a button on my door that does that. I only touch my wing mirrors physically when I wipe the glass. This is why I wonder if someone has been deliberately forcing them."
badparking,fcczhiy,t1_fcci1rg,1577604506.0,"I am now paranoid that old people have been doing this to me! Three times now, when visiting NT properties, my mirrors have been wrenched, and we've had to fix them before driving off. I always tuck them in and was always surprised they were wrenched and I couldn't see how people were shoving against them. 

Now I wonder if they were doing it deliberately. NT parking always seems to be a free-for-all anyway, no lines or even a proper car park (and yet they still charge...) so I bet some cap-wearing OAP felt my parking wasn't up to scratch!"
britishproblems,fccwmzg,t1_fcbcjjk,1577603538.0,"My local one when I lived in Paris was really very insistent that it WASN'T a library - signs on practically every shelf in the magazine section! It was a v popular hangout for British residents, as their book shop area was lovely, like a proper book shop. As a poor au-pair, I could easily spend a couple of hours reading the magazines - the mark-up for UK magazines was easily double original price, so I would rarely buy them."
britishproblems,fccvrvf,t1_fcbf7xf,1577603236.0,"I wonder what happened to the WHSmith loyalty card. I lost mine, but even before that, the cashiers had told me they weren't allowed to ask if customers had one (unlike the cashiers in Morisons, for example!) so I assume the management were trying to get rid of it. It wasn't bad - I remember getting a scientific calculator and an Eddie Izzard cassette with my points (late 90s I think)."

So, if a man told me my period pain was 'valid' I think I'D be pissed off. It's not transphobic, it's someone being condescening about something they know nothing about."
