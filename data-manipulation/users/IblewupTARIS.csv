Shoes-I normally wear boots, so those are so I can work out every day. I wear athletic clothes under my everyday clothes.

Hat-In case I need it really. I usually wear it working out.

2 pairs of sunglasses-One for bright days, one for overcast days

Squeezer thingy-something to keep my hands busy if I need it

Bible/Notebook-What’s a man to do without digging in the word?

Pipe-I enjoy a smoke every once in a while. I normally have my tobacco in the places I smoke, so that’s not in there.

Golf tee-a cheaper alternative to an actual pipe tamper and one I wouldn’t really care about losing

2 calculators-One is a graphing calculator. The other is a scientific calculator. Some classes don’t allow graphing calculators on tests.

4 knives-you can never have too many knives, and I use them all for different situations.

3 flash drives-one for taking care of business, one for getting things done, one for games and stuff.

Knowing God Personally-A small handbook to simply and quickly explain the gospel. I figured why memorize it when I can keep it with me and potentially give it to someone.



Note: I keep the stuff on the bottom right in my pockets every day, even when I don’t go to class."

hockey,fel3cux,t1_fekno1x,1579213175.0,"It’ll be really interesting to see if/when advanced metrics really take hold in hockey. I think we’ll see a ton of guys be super over/underrated. I’m not saying Ovi isn’t amazing, but there definitely might be some Dante Bichette types who “hit .300”, but then you realize that they were abysmal on defense and played in the most hitter friendly park in history, making them actually negatively impact their team. I feel like we’ll see the most variance with defensemen.
I think Ovi will turn out to be more like Derek Jeter. He checks all the boxes offensively, but his defense probably looks better than it really is most of the time. It doesn’t really matter because his offensive value is so good that it outweighs the bad.
I could see defensive forwards turning out to be even more underrated than we think."

dankmemes,feji1pk,t1_fej8d0p,1579175178.0,"The fact is, sexuality is defined by the way someone lives their life. A person can neither be homosexual nor straight until they begin to make decisions in their life according to that. Some people certainly have a propensity to go one way or another, which leads us to this conversation. Neither is possible to live the way God asks us to. That’s why Christ came to save us from ourselves.
In reality, we are called neither to be gay nor straight. Paul says we should instead yield our lives to Christ and live for his kingdom. Significant Others distract from that. But basically if you can’t control yourselves (burn with passion), you are called to marriage. Marriage is in a large part intended for procreation, so straight marriage is really the only one allowed.

Race is an immutable characteristic, and racism is abhorrent and disgusting. Christ never upheld or encouraged racism, and he acted against it, by dying for everyone no matter the race. He loves all races equally.

While you probably hate me and don’t care about what I have to say, God teaches us to love each other above all else. I’m praying for you and hope that Christ reaches you and blows you away with his love. The guy that created the universe loved you enough to come and die a gruesome and painful death, so that you could spend forever with him. That’s pretty awesome, and I pray that one day that realization hits you. 
I don’t know how much effect one guy over the Internet can have, but I do know how much effect God can have."
dankmemes,fejgp5i,t1_fej1h6y,1579173415.0,"The Bible absolutely says non-Christians go to hell. John 14:6 (Jesus speaking) “I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. Nobody comes to The Father except through me.” 
Romans 6:23 “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus, our lord.”

Homosexuality is absolutely a sin, unless you go through some kind of mental gymnastics, although it is no more a sin than any other sin is. 
1 Corinthians 6:9-11     “9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, 10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.”

1 Corinthians 7:1-3      “1 Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: ""It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman."" 2 But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 3 The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband.”

1 Timothy 1:8-11  “8 Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, 9 understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, 10 the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, 11 in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.”

We’re all born into sin, so homosexual people are no more born to be a homosexual than I am born to be a sex addict. Everyone has their personal sins and struggles, and that’s fine. We should all love one another and support each other enough to see past those issues, like Christ did.

You are correct, Jesus said the greatest of all commandments is “Love the Lord with all your heart, and love your neighbor as yourself”
As I said earlier, you can love someone without agreeing with their life decisions."
dankmemes,fej1exg,t1_feirnmh,1579153428.0,"I agree with you completely. I would just like to add that non-Christians also seem to misunderstand this difference too. 
Just because I disagree with one aspect of what someone chooses to believe or how to act, doesn’t mean I hate them. You can love someone while disagreeing with their lifestyle entirely, and I believe you could argue that in a lot of cases, disagreeing with someone’s lifestyle can be more loving than supporting it. It’s easy to go along to get along. It’s harder to show someone why you think they’re wrong."
dankmemes,fej0y6h,t1_feir399,1579152982.0,"I’ve always thought of it like this: for non-Christians, treat them kindly and tell them the gospel. You believe non-Christians are going to hell, so it is your responsibility to tell them that and encourage them. Don’t be fake, and make sure they understand what they’re getting into when they dedicate their life to Christ. They’re going to learn to put Christ’s teachings ahead of their own opinions, because he’s infallible, and they’re not. 

However, once they’ve accepted Christ and follow his teachings, it is your responsibility as a brother or sister in Christ to bring certain areas of sin to their attention in a graceful and kind way. Since a Christian, by definition, is trying to live their life for Christ and after his teachings, they would want you to do that and be grateful for it.

The big issues are: 
1) Many self-proclaimed Christians aren’t actually Christians in that they don’t follow Christ. They might go to church etc., but they don’t live it out or actually take any of it seriously.
2) They may not be very knowledgeable about the Bible due to being new or immature Christians. They haven’t studied and understood it. Then they call everyone out on every one of their sins, especially ones they perceive to be worse than others. They expect people to play by the rules to a game they’ve never even learned and don’t know they’re playing.
3) Many Christians are very hypocritical. If they weren’t sinners, they wouldn’t need Christ, and therefore, they wouldn’t need to be Christians. This is something that community should be pointing out in someone’s life that they might have more grace toward unbelievers, but a lot of Christians aren’t in real/good community with other believers.

Christians need to be better. We’re the body of Christ, and we should act like it. Not by rebuking people that don’t know any better, but by showing them why they don’t need to be ruled by their sins. I’m a judgmental addict that lies and cheats his way through life. I’m a people-pleaser and manipulator, but I’ve surrendered my life to Christ, who wiped all that away by dying on the cross and rising again. It gives you so much freedom to realize that you are living in this broken world now, but you are living for a perfect God that you might have a whole and perfect world someday in heaven.

Christianity isn’t meant to be a rule book. It’s meant to be a crutch that you can lean on and experience joy throughout even the worst of trials."

dankmemes,fedf7s7,t1_fede0hl,1579009882.0,"I played (and lettered in) 5 sports in high school. Our school had very abnormally high activity rates, so most of our athletes played multiple sports. I think if you took all the rosters of all the sports and counted each player, you wound up with more kids than were in the school.
So some of our sports had morning practices to help accommodate that. Normally they were mostly workout/conditioning focused. So say I ran cross country and played soccer. They’d both have morning and afternoon practices. I’d go to cross country in the morning, when I was finished, maybe I’d go to soccer practice if there was time left. Then I’d go to soccer practice in the afternoon.
I wish I could’ve played more extracurriculars too, but there literally wasn’t the time. I wanted to swim, do drama and choir, and play golf too on top of track, cross country, baseball, basketball, and soccer.
My freshman and sophomore years, I lost 20 pounds each fall, because I didn’t have time to consume enough calories to maintain body weight.
