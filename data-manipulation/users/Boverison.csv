AskReddit,fembu73,t3_epx6yg,1579247696.0,"I don't know if it specifies as ""Robbing"" or more like ""swindling"".   
Back in the day when I went to school Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh Cards where the hot thing and everybody brought their cards to play and to trade in breaks. 

So what I did to get the ultimate collection is going to 2nd and 3rd graders and trade them all their rare cards against a bunch of commons and told them it is a good deal."

It is natural process and there is nothing to be ashamed of so I feel like celebrating this as something nice and ""becoming a woman"" makes this something special and eliminates the fear or shamefulness of it."

TooAfraidToAsk,feld7l5,t1_fel4hyc,1579219423.0,"I have the same opinion. It's gonna be the same sensation as fainting or blacking out - except you won't regain consciousness. I once had a seizure of taking too many tramadol and I don't remember anything of it. It just stops at one point and my girlfriend said I asked for help because I couldn't breathe and then it was kinda like the ""death rattle"" trying to breathe. But I don't remember anything of it, like sleeping without a dream. That is how it's gonna be."

tifu,fejtyj6,t1_fejr77b,1579185787.0,Why not talk to your special one about it? Since your Username is JustDiscoveredSex maybe you can also discover the kinks of your loved one and have this even more special bond with him. Be open about it. Secrets never lead to anything good in my opinion.
wholesomememes,feic0m2,t1_fei24zj,1579134971.0,Exactly what I was thinking! But very interesting to see the difference also in regards to the US and Europe.
wholesomememes,fei0ttp,t1_fehuqy3,1579127824.0,"I did my ""Realskole"" in Germany at a danish school and then went on to Aabenraa where I did my HF and we would all be on first name base, so I guess so, yes."
wholesomememes,fehmmuw,t1_fehlpq3,1579119626.0,"Interesting. So you would also attend funerals of teacher you weren't fond of?I ask because where I come from you wouldn't really attend a funeral of your teacher even though you have a personal connection to them

(I went to a danish school in Germany and we were a smaller-size classroom with around 10 people and we were always on first name base with every teacher but still never attended a funeral since it's more for family)"
sports,fehfhdl,t1_fehe2s3,1579115457.0,Indeed what I thought as well but I got corrected by helping comments saying it's from turkey. I do am a German myself so no racism here.

memes,feh6kv2,t3_ep2loa,1579110210.0,It actually goes so far that when I made my food and don't find the right thing to watch I get super frustrated. Also when I cook for my girlfriend and myself and she already starts to eat next to me and then I hear her eating sounds I get even more frustrated because I want to eat so badly but also need to find something nice to watch. So a tradition around here is first find something to watch and then start cooking
