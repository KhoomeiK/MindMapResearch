Capitalism is the reason why many live without a home. Capitalism is the reason why many go without food. We live in a society of abundance, but even then people are still suffering. The alienation of labour is also a huge factor of depression for many."

Vi har fått mye skryt for inkluderingsarbeidet vårt, og i fjor vant vi en pris for nettopp det. Vi prøver å ha opplegg og aktiviteter som treffer bredt. 

I fadderperioden forsøkte vi å ha annenhver dag med alkohol og uten alkohol, og oppmøtet var generelt veldig bra på alle dagene. Fra venner i andre linjeforeningen har jeg hørt at oppmøte på edruaerangementer kan være veldig dårlig, men hos oss bruker det å være veldig bra.

Nabla, som er linjeforeningen for FysMat er også veldig aktiv, men jeg kan ikke uttale meg om dem i noen særlig dybde."
ntnu,fe8qm2s,t3_eo4zze,1578929395.0,"Gjennom en bachelor + master i fysikk har du mye større mulighet til å velge fag selv. En sivilingeniørgrad, som FysMat er, er du veldig bundet til det planlagte løpet. I tillegg kan du ta mye mer dyptgående fag ettersom FysMat har mange ikke-relaterte fag som kjemi, ledelse, og liknende.

Når det kommer til jobbmuligheter slipper man nok billigere unna med en sivilingeniørgrad I FysMat ettersom arbeidsgiver vet akkurat hva de får. Med en bachelor + master må man selge seg inn mer på egenhånd, og peke til relevant kompetanse.

Jeg er sikkert litt farget av å gå bachelor i fysikk selv, men personlig søkte jeg i utgangspunktet på FysMat men kom ikke inn. I ettertid har jeg skjønt at det nok var det beste for meg å ta en bachelor."

The optimal solution would be to give the sheep that are already born a good life for the rest of their lives, and stop breeding them. If this includes sheering them, we should of course do that. 

A more realistic solution would be to stop breeding them, but keeping exploiting the ones that are already born.
