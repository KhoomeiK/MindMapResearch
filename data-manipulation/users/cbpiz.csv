Advice,fffkt9c,t1_ffehkqa,1579886120.0,"Nothing happened to it.  Honestly, I bought it assuming I would lose the money because of the rah rah by Reddit believers.  You can find information right here.  It’s an involved investment requiring multiple “ wallets” and finding people that accept it as payment.   I don’t know enough about it to know how to buy a percentage of a coin.  Try r/bitcoin"
Advice,ffehgnr,t3_et6ezp,1579848169.0,Bitcoin was the best investment I ever made in 2016 . I bought one bitcoin for 534 as a fluke. In Dec 17 I sold it for 12400.  I wouldn’t touch it now with a ten foot pole.  Some people still have faith.  I took the money and ran.

If the siblings know about your daughter and you want to assist your daughter in finding them when she is an ADULT in five years, you can attempt to keep track of them on social media, without bothering them, and provide her with the information at that time.  You should NEVER have anything to do with contacting them on her behalf.  If she wants to contact them, while it having nothing to do with you, in five years.  That will be her choice."

Advice,fel4upz,t1_fel3wps,1579214095.0,"Several years ago I had a total nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma.  That means that they took my entire kidney out.  And not laparoscopy either.  I was cut opened and had one rib removed to get to the kidney which they took followed by radiation and chemo. I never have, nor never would call myself a ""cancer survivor"".  I don't talk about my illness nor will I ever let it define me.   What I am saying to you, is you obviously were defined by it and I am not sure if you were confused or your parents were but at this point, you need to seek therapy to find out WHY not having the illness like you thought would make you feel ""isolated and fake"".  Honestly, counseling.  It is important."

Advice,fekd0l1,t3_epmae6,1579197480.0,"Yeah...ignore these people.  The most selfish thing you can do is tell her.  It is about clearing your OWN conscience.  It isn't going to make her feel better and if you really feel as guilty as you say, you won't do it again.  If you think there is a chance you WILL do it again, then walk away from the relationship.  If you think there may be a future, stay away from the ex, stop being so feckless and make it up to her by not telling her your secret but by showing her every single day how much you really care."

The telephone, airplane, video games, wireless communication, mini computers, etc.  By far the biggest contribution will end up being CRISPR technology from the University of California Berkeley funded by the US federal government of over 400 million  per year for scientific research.  Although Switzerland is the most proactive with R and D funding worldwide, you simply don't have the economy to throw 66 billion, almost your entire budget, at research each year."

Even though the funds are mostly going for military aid to middle eastern countries we screwed up in the first place.

dogs,feemfr0,t1_feeln2c,1579036718.0,"Its an old thread or I am certain I would have heard it.  I've been attacked before.  I simply don't care.  When one dog's cholesterol went up, we made an adjustment, when the other had some liver weirdness, we made another.  I trust my homemade food more than the most expensive kibble on the market.  I know what I am feeding my old guys at all times.  Quality control differences by manufacturers do not give me much confidence in their standards."

They get this at night, free feeding kibble during the day (which they rarely touch).  Been feeding this way for many years with vet approval and modifications resulting from blood work changes due to age.  Both my guys have far exceeded their ""average"" life expectancy. I credit the fresh food and doogie door allowing them to sun themselves as needed."
dogs,feeibg3,t3_eoiniv,1579034328.0,"Dogs bond with certain people.  If it were all about who feeds them or plays with them, it would be easy.  But it isn't.  Your dog has identified your mum as his person and there isn't much you can do to change that other than move away with him.  That doesn't mean he doesn't love you.  It just means you aren't the one he seeks approval from."
motherinlawsfromhell,feehs0w,t1_feefjlp,1579034014.0,I define pretty nasty as a comment that one wouldn't say to a stranger's face.  You don't have to disrespect someone's reading abilities or master of the language to make a point.
dogs,feeh96r,t3_eoma2z,1579033715.0,This is actually a good idea.  I had stairs for my guys when they got too old to get up on their own but I wish I had thought to do it to make it easier for them when they were younger.  Now I have to lift them up and lift them down which can get annoying with their old man bladders at 2am and 4am.
dogs,feeggyz,t1_fedwrqm,1579033260.0,"It likely did help the bond issue.  Fellow dog people are amazed at the absolute dedication my dog has with me and me to him.  Even the vet is shocked that he can do all sorts of procedures on my (now) old man with no sedation as long as I am there.  I truly believe it goes back to me hand feeding him and caring for him after he got very bad pancreatitis as a puppy.  He is 15 now and terminally ill. It is going to break my heart to let him go.  He has been more than a velcro dog, he may as well have been surgically attached to my side.  I thought I was going to lose him Christmas day but the little trooper pulled through kidney failure with meds, patiently allowing me to insert a daily IV and a lot of TLC.  He's not ready to leave me and I am not ready to let him go.   Love your guy for as long as you can.  Their lives are too short and it isn't fair."
