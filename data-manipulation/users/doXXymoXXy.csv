aww,ffusxjp,t3_ev89ut,1580248743.0,What a delightful smile!
SubaruForester,ffujj2v,t1_ffugfd3,1580243287.0,"It's certainly much easier to just trade in my current car to the dealer, so I don't think it would make or break the deal. CarMax offered me $700."
SubaruForester,ffufy3w,t1_ffucu5s,1580241137.0,"Not sure. They quoted $2500 for the car, and an additional $2750 discount. My guess is that  without the car they would have given a $5000 discount. 

My thought tonight was to ask for an additional $1000 off."
SubaruForester,ffuac0l,t1_ffu9u87,1580237793.0,LOL I'm not really sure. I guess I was trying to say that 1) some places are trying to earn business from customers even if they don't have great credit  and 2) the internet has made new resources available that used to not exist. Sorry for the diarrhea of the mouth! :)
SubaruForester,ffu7zew,t1_ffr2xac,1580236403.0,20 years ago I was broke with no assets. I used Lending Tree to get a loan that I probably otherwise wouldn't have been able to qualify for. Wonder how they're doing?
SubaruForester,fft7d14,t3_eueegt,1580210791.0,I decided the Jasper Green is not for me
SubaruForester,ffsck6c,t1_ffsc2tw,1580178473.0,Thank you for assuaging my fears!
autism,ffs9wzl,t1_ffs58hr,1580176708.0,"Yes, definitely, thank you! I'm willing to try any approach (barring essential oils lol) to communicate and connect with him."
SubaruForester,ffs9n6q,t1_ffs8d5c,1580176521.0,"My other (stupid) concern is, what's going to happen to my car if it goes to the dealer versus a Subie enthusiast? I feel like I'm sending my old workhorse to the slaughter house rather than to a warm, green pasture. My cars got lots of good life left, if treated right."
oddlysatisfying,ffrfger,t3_euo0d1,1580157024.0,I just got wicked vertigo looking at this!
autism,ffrdnyn,t1_ffnygbz,1580155942.0,Thank you for sharing your experience!
autism,ffq7t76,t1_ffpn9xh,1580124984.0,"Thanks for volunteering to explain. Constant Leadership can look at my post history to understand that the indications are many and diverse. And that I have been seeking an active dialogue with this community in an attempt to learn as much as I can. And can reread my original response to see that testing is happening now. Either way, that response seems like projecting personal experiences onto an internet stranger: unhelpful but satisfying."
SubaruForester,ffpd4zf,t1_ffp64of,1580092066.0,I just realized the Jasper Green is the same color as my cat's eyes.
SubaruForester,ffp6aow,t1_ffp64of,1580087317.0,"Meanwhile the grey with saddle brown is on the lot, ready to be driven away."
SubaruForester,ffp64of,t3_eueegt,1580087201.0,The dealer said it would take 7 weeks to get a Jasper green vehicle on the lot.
