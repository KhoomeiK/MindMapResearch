I was severely sleep deprived at the time so I just sort of stared at him. Even after going for 36 hours without sleep, I STILL knew that it was a messed up thing to say. That guy was basically a red flag manufacturing company even before that, so that moment only strengthened my desire to stay far away from him. He then possibly stalked me for a bit before losing interest. A year later, we all found out that he was a sex offender who was violating his terms of probation by going on the college campus, and the Pokémon Go group we were all in kicked him out and banned him from interacting with us.

The runner up: I was next to a dog park playing Pokémon Go when a guy with his dog started demanding that I tell him why I was actually there. At first he did not believe I was just playing Pokémon Go and got mad at me. Then he seemed to realize that I really was trying to play the game and suddenly switched to flirting with me, giving me emotional whiplash. I left soon after, because that situation was just weird. Interrogating a girl as to her real motives is not a good pick up strategy."

I once traded a slightly low IV shiny Rayquaza for another trainer’s slightly low IV shiny Rayquaza, and this gave me a perfect lucky shiny Rayquaza!"

BPDlovedones,ffv9e4l,t3_evarrw,1580258798.0,"This happened all the time. We actually had similar politics and beliefs on many things, (I’m center left and she’s a bit further left) but if I didn’t lose my head over an issue she was upset about she would say I didn’t care and get mad at me for it. I could still be upset over the issue but it wasn’t good enough for her unless I was freaking out. I’m a fairly calm and calm-appearing person in real life, and it takes a lot for me to lose it, so this caused a lot of stupid fights.

I don’t know if it’s so much about the actual issues as it  partly is a way for them to feel good about themselves and feel like they are Good People because they care so much they lose control of themselves, and everyone else are not nearly as Good as them because they obviously don’t care. It seemed that way for her at least.

I also noticed that she never really seemed to gain a lot of influence over other social justice warriors because people would recognize that she was unstable and take that into account. She wanted power and influence, but she never really got it."

BPDlovedones,fefxd0e,t3_eov4wv,1579068331.0,"I had a friend who has uBPD. She got fired multiple times due to her behavior, and I was the person who calmed her down afterwards and kept her from going back to the workplace and threatening to kill her boss or just vandalizing things. (In her mind, screaming at her boss and threatening to kill her would show how much she really cared, and then her boss would give her job back and everything would be great.)

I also recently read the book The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker and one chapter was about workplace violence. Part of that dealt with firing employees who could become a danger. Among other things that I cannot remember off the top of my head, it recommended doing the firing with a person to witness things and be backup if necessary, to do it in a neutral private room and NOT your office (you want to be able to leave easily, and you can’t do that if they are in your office), and to do it at the end of the day so that their routine is not too messed up. It also recommended doing this at the end of the week, also because you don’t want to disturb the person’s routine too much. 

I really hope things go well."

She lives in and grew up in the United States in an area that people don’t constantly blast their horns so it wasn’t a cultural thing, she just has extreme road rage and anger issues and this was one of the many signs of that."

While at college, I also once l got to play the game of School Bombing vs Firecrackers. A group of people I was with suddenly halted as we all tried to figure out if someone had just bombed the school or if someone was setting off extremely overpowered illegal fireworks for no reason, as it was obviously a large explosion on or next to school grounds. It was 10 terrifying minutes of us arguing (half the group wanted to hide and call the cops, a quarter of the group said it was probably just fireworks and wanted to ignore them, and the rest wanted to go investigate the noise) and trying to figure out what to do until we found out it was just fireworks."
