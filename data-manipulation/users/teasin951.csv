offmychest,ffwlkub,t3_evmu0o,1580304788.0,"I feel the same most of the time. Sleep is super important. You benefit from 8 hours a day so much. I'm annoyed how our society suppresses sleep, it's dumb."

offmychest,ffthycn,t3_ev5ren,1580221028.0,"Thanks for sharing the story. I feel sorry for you. Have you tried a psychologist? He will talk to you and maybe even help you to talk to others. Give it a shot. 

Good luck and rest of the day, mate ;)"
offmychest,ffth8op,t1_fftgmhi,1580220477.0,"Yeah, I mean, they might give you few weird looks but that's it. Some may ask, just tell them it was a panic attack. In a week nobody will remember ;)"
offmychest,fftg6a8,t3_ev5ta4,1580219616.0,"Panic attacks are shit. But I don't think you have that much to shame for. Just apologize and act normally. If you have a good friend in the class he will hold you up.

offmychest,ffqvl3t,t3_euq3l9,1580144633.0,"You're getting great advices and I just wanna add my point of view.

As a guy my self, I would highly appreciate my girlfriend to show me how she likes it, how to please her. I'm not experienced (according to the post your boyfriend isn't either) so I would thrive for that sort of stuff. 

If he is a good boyfriend, he will care about your pleasure. You should have no fear showing him (I know it's not easy for you)."

offmychest,ffqbxgd,t3_eun8p3,1580129736.0,"That's a bummer. Maybe it's nothing serious. Maybe he really was just busy. Try to get through this week and hopefully he will text you. If he really wants to hang out, he will text, wait for him.

I know this feeling where you are the one always texting first, arranging meet ups, all that and he doesn't. But it shows something about him if it's happening over and over.

Have a good day."
offmychest,ffqb6m8,t3_eunbpo,1580128964.0,"Man, chill out. These days there are really number of options how to cure it. I think you are fine. I also don't get why you've lost people around you...

offmychest,ffiy0m0,t3_etw1rz,1579985498.0,"Man, these has to be hard times. I have really nothing to say just that I feel sorry for you. Be strong. I wish you the best of luck."
offmychest,fffmo0e,t1_fffktqz,1579887253.0,"Yeah, I asked because you should sleep at least 8 hours a day. 

And why I think it's important in your case is that sleep (among a lots of other things) helps you have a clearer mind and be more logical, not emotional, as well as have balanced hormones, which helps not to have emotional breakdowns or black outs, how you described them.

I feel sorry for how your life is going right now. And, as I see it, sleep might help you. Maybe in parallel with psychologist or whatever if you feel so.

If you wanna know more why you definitely should sleep, a great book: Why do we sleep - Matthew Walker. 

Good night and have a great up coming day :)"

But I don't think they are necessary bad. For example adolescent need socialising and social media can help. Not talking about refusing from a group just because you don't use them. 

I'm not saying you said that, just to note."

learnmath,fdkn6b9,t1_fdkmr23,1578507049.0,"Yeah it is xD

I misread it at first as well..."
learnmath,fdkm4ol,t1_fdkhgql,1578506404.0,"I don't think this assumption is correct. Simply from the fact that you have more winning positions than just one.

And the first throw it doesn't matter what option it will be, in another you need to hit the other 3 options to win. So there is not the same chance every round. 

I could be wrong, this is just how I see it."
learnmath,fdkktg1,t3_elv591,1578505648.0,"Look, imagine you don't know where you are throwing and your goal is to throw 4 stones in line, stones can stack on to of each other

You throw 1 stone - doesn't matter where it Landes

You throw the second one - you have now 25% chance that you will hit the last stone 

3rd - 50% chance hitting either one of occupied places (if stones aren't stacked yet)

4th - 75% change of hitting already thrown stone (again if there are no stones stucked yet)

Now, if you have 1 stone landed on top of another, you've lost this game, BUT if you have another stone, you have another 25% change of hitting the missing place and thus winning the game (if only one stone is on top of each other)

If you again miss the empty spot BUT you have 6th stone you again have 25% change of fixing your missing (without the 6th you would loose)

See? If you have infinitely many stones to try fixing your mistakes, eventually you will win."
learnmath,fdkdyjx,t3_elv591,1578501838.0,It doesn't. Every round you will have ¼ chance to get either one of the options.

nextfuckinglevel,fd33i91,t1_fd3155w,1578154391.0,"Ok I don't know how I'm arguing. I have to admit I didn't know about the ban. So that changes the state that you are citing.

I'm not blaming the city. Man, I mentioned it. It's not as easy to say to Sydney to forget on this and donate money. Of course government should take some action. There is a thread about this. 

And the thing contributing to climate change are the fireworks them self. Not that they cause fire somewhere."
nextfuckinglevel,fd30l7u,t1_fd2yomz,1578153614.0,"Man, I'm not arguing with you. It's not as easy as just say: ""give all your money to fire department and then believe you won't suffer"" It's definitely not. 

What I'm saying is that fireworks contribute to climate change and I wouldn't be surprised if fire truck or two would have to leave the base because of someone starting another fire with fireworks. 

Of course there are worse things that contribute to our planet heating. 

The think is, we are not in an ideal state. Not at all. And some compromises will have to be made in order for us to survive this age. Like we don't need to have so much of pyrotechnics at the end of the year.

Edit: yeah the fire is in charge of government. And there is a thread discussing this topic as well."
nextfuckinglevel,fd2y9ej,t1_fd2sovx,1578152852.0,"Yeah tourism matters when we are all charcoal... 

Look, we are getting into a big big trouble with the way how we treat our planet. Forest burning is a disaster 'cos all the CO2 captured in the trees is now getting back into the atmosphere.

That causes green-house effect (planet heats up), more water can be in the atmosphere (water is much much stronger green-house gas). Our planet heats up and fires are easier to start and spread. 

It's supper complex problem and I don't have a solution that wouldn't be without compromises. Nobody does yet."

nextfuckinglevel,fd2kfp7,t1_fd2jji2,1578148498.0,"Not relevant? Man is right about the topic. Maybe you can't do anything about this year, but you have to talk about it so it's not the same next year. I don't think it's irrelevant. What's irrelevant is this whole thread where I argue with you."
nextfuckinglevel,fd2iniq,t1_fd2gt55,1578147786.0,It was an allusion on the topic.
nextfuckinglevel,fd2iiq8,t1_fd2h27c,1578147739.0,"Wouldn't you punish the hole world by pumping great amounts of fumes into the atmosphere?

But this is not what the original comment was about. It was just saying that fire department couldn't be happy about all the fireworks and would rather have the money which it cost. 

As well as it was an allusion to what we prioritise.

And I know Sydney couldn't sent the money to fire department because the fireworks were all ready ordered. And it would be a huge waste of money not to light it up. Still there is the thing how it pollutes atmosphere... But that's not what the original comment is about."
nextfuckinglevel,fd2gb97,t1_fd2f9ij,1578146805.0,It's not an argument it's a statement. And I know the money was already spent.
nextfuckinglevel,fd2foob,t1_fd2exhf,1578146541.0,Yeah it was too late. It was all ordered for huge amount of money.

Yeah... You are better out...

Oh really? I play piano too. I'm nowhere professional pianist though. I attended piano classes for 2 years then the teacher left so I started all over again with a new one. After a year this one left and I started all over again with this one. After a year my dad rejected to pay this one 'cos she didn't teach me anything. 

I was supposed to start again but I was super tired of doing everything again. So I ended.

Now after like 7 years my sister got a piano for the last Christmas and I started playing again.

I'm also trying to learn violin and sometimes guitar.

Do you also learn on your own?"

The therapist manner is super weird. I've never attended one but how could they don't care about your problems enough. That's ridiculous.

I think you've made the right choose with the job. You better take care of your self. And DV/sexual assault... Uff, you've went through something... But I'm happy to hear that you've recently got rid of the last one :)  I'm sorry for the kitten...

I really think something has to change in order for humanity to survive. The problem is that there is longer the propaganda that nothing is happening than the fact something is. 

What's sad, people are not educated enough to see the problem or think, why should THEY change if their neighbours will still continue in old habits.

We are going to end badly if nothing changes. And I don't think you are overreacting. The problems are really there and not that many people bother to see them..."
