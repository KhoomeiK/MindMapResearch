SandersForPresident,fft3set,t3_euw2s6,1580205563.0,"If Sanders is again cheated out of the nomination and doesn't do anything (except support the nominee), the US will forever stay fucked. Sanders should care more about people then party. He should stand up for himself and not go down without a fight. When the DNC rigs the primary, Sanders should run as an independent, giving everyone there middle finger. But we all know that wouldn't happen, like for years ago, he'll bend over and take it like the ""nice-guy"" he is. And his supporters should either priest the shit outta the DNC and run it over, withdraw their support altogether (why else did you support Sanders to begin with if you're as easily gonna back the establishment), loudly say they'll vote Trump and fuck everything up, to hell with a country that tries it's hardest to keep a nation poor and ignorant."

They also deserve better (actual) access to mental-health care, clean drinking water across the nation, clean energy, better environmental regulations, for their government to be run by them and not driven by ""donations""(bribes) from the filthy rich (money AND religion out of politics)...etc.
