YouShouldKnow,fevsxy6,t1_fetnk7y,1579401065.0,"Even though they are classed as such, I wouldn't describe places like Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, Kew Gardens, Hampton Court Palace etc as ""museums"". Museums to me are buildings purposely built for displaying objects for visitors to view. Almost all museums like this in the UK are free or costs just a few quid to enter. London Transport Museum may cost a pretty penny, but it's free for children. I highly encourage donating to all museums though for their upkeep."

YouShouldKnow,fevk8to,t1_fev84my,1579398368.0,">you often have to pay to go into Churches

That's only true if you're a visitor who wants to look around, climb up, etc. Out of thousands of religious sites in the UK, there's only a handful of cathedrals with admission fees. These fees are important for the upkeep of heritage sites. If you're attending a service, it's of course free to enter. Is it not like this everywhere?"

Greater London Urban Area =/= Greater London. Greater London is London sans City of London. Greater London Urban Area refers to the commuter areas where people travel into London from daily. Do not spread misinformation.

/u/RainingUpvotes, Hemel Hempstead is not in London, nor does it represent London."

No, it bloody isn't. If it was ""about the same"", then why don't you just swallow it?? It's your bodily fluid that can contain all manner of germs and pass on diseases. Nobody should have to see your revolting behaviour and try to dodge your saliva and phlegm. Keep it in your mouth, or keep it in Spain."

>I wish my government would stop tracking me

No one is sitting there watching your every move. You're not interesting. Stop being paranoid. If you're not committing a crime, you shouldn't have anything to worry about, no? Seriously, you anti-surveillance tinfoil hat-wearers love to hate on CCTV, undermining the evidence it provided in so many cases, all the while watching countless footages online. Give me one example where public CCTV had been been misused here in the UK..."
