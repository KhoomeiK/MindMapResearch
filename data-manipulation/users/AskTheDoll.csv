wholesomememes,fek0ihu,t1_fejsul3,1579189992.0,"Because some people with depression cope by indulging themselves with others, and maybe overcompensate with high energy in those moments. You would feel great hanging out, but when you get home and you’re alone with your thoughts, the darkness comes again. You are reminded of all your problems and your depressing thoughts causes all that energy to come crashing down, and it makes you wonder wether you were truly happy or just distracting yourself. Then you cycle through social media and hope your overthinking goes away long enough for you to fall asleep.

Or so I hear."

GachaLifeCringe,fctcl5u,t1_fcs42m3,1577939044.0,"Its actually colour coordination. The reason why is because black and red compliment each other, and both colours are typically associated with evil and darkness. Blonde/Gold compliment white, and both colours are typically associated with good and light. Unfortunately why a lot of demon/angel artworks and character design seem almost copypaste - it just works better."
