Leathercraft,fgmce9s,t1_fgm39p4,1580921893.0,Not sure. I worked on a leather chair with mold spots using the alcohol\water mixture and it took the mold off. Not having your boots in front of me but seeing how dark the mold is makes me think it may be more difficult for you. Best thing to do is try
Leathercraft,fgm2b77,t3_ezarxl,1580916549.0,Try a mixture of water and rubbing alcohol but your boots are likely going to be stained beneath the spots.
whatsthisrock,fgm1yv3,t3_ezb12p,1580916333.0,"Yep. So, dendrites look like plant fossils but aren't plants or fossils at all. It is manganese that forms those pretty fern like shapes."
