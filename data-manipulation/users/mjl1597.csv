travel,ffdgdh0,t3_eszoec,1579820304.0,"Great question. My job forces me to deal with Visa problems. A P2 Visa usually takes 60 days to process or 30 days if you expedite the process. You can legally stay in the United states for 90 days without a Visa. If you find yourself closing in on the 90 days, you must apply for a B2 visa. Which is a tourist visa. This should take less than a month to process because you are from Australia. Unfortunately you cannot legally make money on a B2 visa but it grants you additional time in the US while your P2 is processing."

Never been a fan of anime but I was dating some one who is. I asked her what a good ""starter anime"" to try  and she recommended Death Note. I didnt expect much but that shit slaps.

AskReddit,fbtctna,t3_eefatp,1577074738.0,"Growing up I always had a big xmas with my family. Mom, dad, sister, grandparents, aunt, uncle, etc. I loved it every year. A few years ago my parents divorced and more than half my family moved to the west coast so it was just my mom and I. Her mom passed away that year so she was not looking forward to the holidays. We decided to get each other one thing. I asked a local artist to paint a picture of my mom and her mom on the last day they spent together. It was a beautiful picture. When my mom unwrapped the picture she just broke down with all the emotions and we hugged for a long time. Hands down best Christmas."
