fatlogic,fdripc3,t3_emlll0,1578685122.0,"This article is so stupid. Some gems:

***""It perpetuates the misconception that weight loss is a simple matter of willpower.""***

Bullshit. It is all a matter of willpower.

***""Any good practitioner should inform you that it is impossible to know how your body will respond to any diet or exercise intervention.""***

Well, why not try anyways and see what happens?

***""A physician cannot guarantee weight loss nor can they determine how long the weight will stay off.""***

Maybe, but I think they can say it will stay off as long as you keep up good habits.

***""There are serious harmful effects that result from dieting.""***

Yes, if you don't do it right, or follow extreme measures."
